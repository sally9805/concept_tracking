What Went Wrong with NASA ? <p> When a rocket lifts off , it lights up the launch area with a brilliant burst of flame and then trails a fiery streak across the sky as it soars toward orbit . But without careful guidance al the pyrotechnics will have been for naught . That is , in short , what happened to the National Aeronautics and Space Agency . <p> Like a rocket , NASA initially lit up the sky , with spectacular feats . But for lack of proper direction from policymakers , the agency failed to continue on a course that would clearly and consistently serve the national interest . Instead NASA steered by a false star . <p> The Challenge <p> At the beginning , of course , few would have imagined that the agency could go so far astray . Indeed , nearly two decades elapsed before this became at all clear . Through the 1960s NASA was running a grand project that had the near unanimous support of Americans for a clear and simply defined goal : Put a man on the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get at once more complicated and less purposeful . <p> The countdown that led to the launch of NASA began on a Friday evening , early in October 1957 . Some fifty scientist had gathered for a cocktail party at the Soviet embassy in Washington . Amid the chatter and clink of glasses , Walter Sullivan of The New York Times was called away for an urgent phone call . A colleague in Manhattan had just seen a dispatch form Tass , the Moscow news agency . It stated that a sphere the size of a beach ball was now circling the earth every 96 minutes , traveling at 18,000 miles per hour and emitting beeps . <p> Sullivan hurried back to the party and told the news to one of the scientist , the physicist Lloyd Berkner , who rapped on the hors d'oeuvre table until the hubbub quieted . " I wish to make an announcement , " he said . " I am informed by The New York Times that a satellite is in orbit at an elevation of 900 kilometers . I wish to congratulate our Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applause . <p> That same evening , at his Texas ranch , Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson heard the news on the radio . After dinner he and a few guests strolled in the dark along a road , their eyes turned upward . " In the Open West you learn to live closely with the sky , " Johnson wrote later . ' It is a part of your life . But now , somehow , in some new way , the sky seemed almost alien . I also remember the profound shock of realizing that it might be possible for another country to achieve technological superiority over this great country of ours . " <p> The same shock would affect many others in the weeks ahead , for this first step into space stood as a clear challenge . There was every reason to see it as vindicating the long-standing communist boast that theirs was the superior system for galvanizing human productivity . An official announcement from Moscow made the point explicit : " Artificial earth satellites will pave the way for space travel , and it seems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor of the people of the new socialist society turns even the most daring of mankind 's dreams into reality . " <p> Many Americans saw Sputnik as no less than a new Pearl Harbor . " The time has come , " said Sen. Styles Bridges , a leading conservative , " to be less concerned with the depth of pile on the new broadloom rug or the height of the tail fin on the new car , and to be more prepared to shed blood , sweat and tears . " On the other side of the aisle , Sen. William Fulbright was equally apocalyptic : " The real challenge we face involves the very roots of our society . It involves our educational system , the source of our knowledge and cultural values . " <p> Sputnik also seemed to call into question the adequacy of Eisenhower administration policies . Eisenhower was responsible for fighting the Cold War , yet he had insisted on balancing the budget and on avoiding major governmental expansions . Plenty of people , not all of them Democrats , were ready to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation to peril . More specifically , his missile-program policies had ruffled military feathers amid problems of interservice rivalry and wasteful duplication . Trevor Gardner , a former Air Force assistant secretary , stated the issue bluntly : " We have presently at least nine ballistic missile programs , all competing for roughly the same kind of facilities , the same kind of brains , and the same public attention . " <p> Public urgency increased early in November , when the Soviets launched their second satellite . It weighed 1,120 pounds , and it carried a dog as a passenger , clearly foreshadowing future flights that would carry a man . Eisenhower , who had come up as a military leader , was not rattled . He knew that our own missile programs were proceeding apace , with long-range rockets already in flight test . America was strong ; our armed forces could defend the nation . Four days after that second Soviet launch , he went on television and stated that their achievement " does not rouse my apprehensions , not one iota . " <p> It nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in its missile programs and in its nascent space activities . The Air Force and Navy already had programs aimed at launching their own satellites , and these would proceed with renewed urgency . Yet in both Congress and the White House , there was a widespread view that space was too important to leave to the generals . There should be a civilian effort as well , under a new agency . That agency came into existence by congressional act in 1958 and was named the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . <p> Liftoff <p> Its genesis lay in a small but longstanding organization , the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics . Working with a shoestring budget , NACA operated two aeronautical laboratories and a propulsion-research center . It had few high-placed Washington friends and little visibility ; as recently as 1954 it had received only half the funds it had requested . It had found its niche as an isolated pocket of expertise , like the Geological Survey . But it had a strong reputation among those who knew of it ; in 1957 its chairman was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of pathbreaking researchers . John Sloop was building the first hydrogenfueled rocket engines ; John Becker had made a wind tunnel that could reach seven times the speed of sound . The aerodynamicists Julian Allen and Alfred Eggers had determined the proper shape for a spacecraft re-entering the atmosphere from orbit . <p> Already , in late 1957 , some one-fifth of NACA 's work was related to space . Even so , NACA by itself was too small to take on the responsibility of running a space program . But it could serve as a nucleus , overseeing existing space and rocket programs . A Navy effort that was seeking to launch small satellites , known as Vanguard , would be one of the first ; so would the Army 's rocket-development group in Alabama , led by the redoubtable Wernher von Braun . Army officials had never quite known what to do with these people ; within the new NASA they would be hailed as kings . <p> The Soviets continued to pull off spectaculars : a 3,000-pound satellite in 1958 , a shot into interplanetary space early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that returned the first photos of its unseen far side , and additional flights carrying dogs . But America was active too . Indeed , while Eisenhower was in the White House , the space program was already undertaking nearly all the principal activities that would occupy it over subsequent decades . <p> The Air Force introduced its Thor and Atlas missiles as satellite launchers , and the even larger Titan was under development . Descendants of those rockets would still be boosting satellites to orbit thirty years later . In 1960 the United States pioneered the important field of satellite communications with the Army 's Courier satellite and the experimental Echo I of Bell Labs . The Navy launched its first navigational satellite , Transit . The first weather satellite , Tiros I , went up , beginning the immensely fruitful application of spacecraft to meteorology and earth observations . Also in 1960 the spacecraft Pioneer V laid groundwork for the planetary program . It sent back radio communications across twenty-two million miles , demonstrating the feasibility of sending probes to Venus and Mars . <p> Two other initiatives pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had won Ike 's approval late in 1958 and sent its first seven astronauts to face the television cameras the following April . Their safe return from orbit would be essential , and the Air Force was showing the way with its Discoverer program . This was opening the field of satellite reconnaissance , carrying cameras to orbit and returning the film to earth in protected capsules . The first successful capsule recovery came in 1960 as well , and while it was not televised , it demonstrated what soon would become a familiar sight to TV viewers : a returning spacecraft swaying gently beneath large red-and-white striped parachutes , slowly descending to the ocean . <p> In short , American response to the Soviets was both vigorous and protean . Yet to the Democrats , led in 1960 by John Kennedy , it was not enough . Four months after his inauguration , in May 1961 , Kennedy called his countrymen to arms : " Now is the time to take longer strides . I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returning him safely to earth . " The response to this challenge would now shape America 's space policy . <p> " A True End Objective " <p> The concept of a manned lunar mission had been germinating within NASA since 1959 . At NASA 's Washington headquarters , a Steering Committee for Manned Spaceflight had met to consider what should be the next step after the simple one-man orbital flights of the pending Mercury program . Its members had looked at space stations and orbiting space laboratories but decided that they had to set their sights higher . Nothing less would do than to send men to the moon . As the committee chairman later put it , " A primary reason for this choice was the fact that it represented a true end objective which was self-justifying and did not have to be supported on the basis that it led to a subsequently more useful end . " The pursuit of the moon would call forth a host of new spacecraft and large rockets , capable of finding uses in earth orbit as well . And no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Among NASA 's leaders support for a moon program coalesced during 1960 . Von Braun in the meantime took the first serious steps toward building big enough rockets , and aerospace firms weighed in with design concepts for lunar spacecraft . By the end of the year , NASA needed only one thing to proceed with a Moon-landing program : presidential approval . <p> The question came up in December 1960 at a White House meeting , and Eisenhower voiced strong opposition . NASA 's plan would cost up to $38 billion , the equivalent of more than $400 billion in today 's economy , based on GNP growth . One of the meeting participants compared such a venture to Columbus 's voyage ; Eisenhower replied that he was " not about to hock his jewels " to send men to the moon . As the historian John Logsdon reports , " The general reaction of the meeting was one of almost sheer bewilderment-or certainly amusement-that anybody would consider such an undertaking . Somebody said , ' This wo n't satisfy everybody . When they finish this , they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of laughter at that thought . " <p> What changed between December and May , when Kennedy announced this astonishing turnabout of national policy ? Headlines made the matter topical , for on April 12 the Soviets had launched their long-awaited first manned flight , sending Yuri Gagarin into orbit and recovering him safely . While the Red star was rising , America 's was in eclipse : the following week saw the debacle of the CIA-sponsored invasion of Cuba 's Bay of Pigs . But on May 5 the United States showed that it , too , had the right stuff , as the astronaut Alan Shepard flew a Mercury capsule on a brief flight that reached an altitude of 115 miles . " Everything 's A-OK , " Shepard repeatedly stated , popularizing a phrase . <p> Yet even a presidential speech does not a policy make , and in 1961 JFK was far from becoming the stuff of legend . He was , however , the leader of a Democratic party gravid with unborn programs , with policy proposals that had been gestating since the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded a Republican in the White House , and there was high hope for a new Hundred Days of legislative activity such as Franklin Roosevelt 's . The poet Robert Frost , in a poem written for the inauguration , had looked ahead to " the glory of a next Augustan age . " And Kennedy 's very name for his administration , the New Frontier , smacked strongly of space flight . A major effort in this area was virtually a foregone conclusion . <p> Health , Wealth , and the Moon <p> So the real question was not whether NASA would undertake a major expansion but how it would get big enough to reach the moon . Two powerful influences helped to assure its great growth . The first was the sweeping nature of the Cold War , which fostered a widespread and genuine conviction that we could not let the Soviets get ahead of us in any area at all . It made no difference that if the Russians wanted to emphasize space flight , they could do so only by weakening other parts of their economy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to building a moon rocket , we had to have one too , or we would fall behind . <p> The second influence lay in a widely shared view of new technology . We tend to see high technology today through the prism of Silicon Valley , a creation of the 1970s and 1980s , but in 1961 the general view was that new technology would arise not through the work of entrepreneurs but through major government programs . This was in line with recent experience . The wartime Manhattan Project had unlocked the power of the atom . Other federal efforts had brought forth jet propulsion and radar . Advocates of a manned moon landing could argue persuasively that such an effort now would bring forth breakthroughs of similar value . <p> Yet Kennedy was not free to propose in too sweeping a spirit . Democrats held both houses of Congress , but the real power lay in a coalition of Republicans and conservative Southerners , many of whom held key committee chairmanships . As a consequence JFK would fail to win passage of so basic a reform as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat in mid-1962 by a vote of 48 to 52 . But those same Southern barons who opposed much social change were great supporters of major aerospace projects , particularly if they involved contracts for their states or districts . Aerospace fitted with their general high regard for things military . And while the Apollo program , the moon-landing project , was civilian from start to finish , it involved people , equipment , and industries that all had close links to the world of longrange missiles . <p> As the decade progressed , a continuing series of manned orbital flights , increasing in intricacy , kept public attention focused on the moon . The death of JFK brought a widespread view that Apollo should go forward as a monument to him . His successor , Lyndon Johnson , was quite likely even more of a space buff than Kennedy , having apparently decided as early as 1957 that it represented an issue that could help reclaim the White House for his party . Kennedy in turn had rewarded Johnson 's fealty by placing NASA 's crown jewel , the Manned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching the White House , proceeded to legislate on a scale that few if any Presidents had ever attained . There would be civil rights bills , Medicare , a tax cut , a war in Vietnam , and much more . As one pundit remarked at the time , LBJ was promising health , wealth , and the moon . <p> Triumph and Eclipse <p> In 1969 , as Neil Armstrong was leading his crew to the first lunar landing , Vice President Spiro Agnew went to Cape Canaveral and announced that NASA 's next goal would be to land men on Mars . Back in Washington , Agnew 's Space Task Group set forth a space program to exceed Apollo both in scope and expense . Its report , published that September , listed three main program options for the 1970s and 1980s . All three called for the development of a small twelve-man space station , a fifty- or hundred-man space base , a reusable space shuttle , lunar orbiting stations , and a station on the moon itself . Two of the three also called for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the astronauts to fly aboard a nuclearpowered rocket . <p> The report amounted to NASA 's wish list , but Mars was not in the ascendancy , and in Washington even the moon was waning . During the Apollo years NASA had grown to expect virtual carte blanche with its budget requests ; in the wake of the Space Task Group report , the agency 's officials were shocked to see their fiscal 1971 budget rejected out of hand . The Office of Management and Budget slashed more than one billion dollars from it . <p> The reason lay in Nixon 's priorities , which contrasted sharply with those of Kennedy and LBJ . Nixon faced inflation , a serious deficit , and continuing costs for the Vietnam War . He had to pull in his horns , spending more carefully and launching new initiatives only in the areas of greatest demand . The environment would qualify , and in 1970 he set up the Environmental Protection Agency . Mars would not . <p> As winter deepened and the 1960s came to an end , NASA had to face seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed the world 's most extensive array of launch vehicles , and it could have fallen back on a policy of promoting their maximum use . That would have brought forth a host of unmanned craft , serving needs in communications , weather , earth observations , and planetary exploration . But the agency had grown fat on the manned Apollo project , and a new manned venture appeared essential to its leaders . <p> NASA 's immediate task was to respond to Nixon 's cutback by lowering its sights yet still save as much as possible of the manned Mars effort . In the administration 's judgment such projects as the big space base , the lunar stations , and the Mars spaceship would be too costly for the foreseeable future . But there still was hope for the space station and the shuttle , both classic concepts in the lore of space flight . <p> The space station was to be a permanently crewed center for research , somewhat like those in Antarctica . It might feature laboratories where scientists would work in weightlessness , using the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away with this prospect . Krafft Ehricke , a leading rocket scientist with no medical background , declared that " we could find a beautiful cure for cancer in space . " ) More to the point , an orbiting station could repair aging satellites . It also could serve as an assembly point for large spacecraft , a task best suited for the now-abandoned Mars effort . <p> The first space-station designs had appeared in print during the 1920s . A 1929 concept by an Austrian engineer , Hermann Noordung , introduced the wheel-shaped configuration that would much later turn up in the movie 2001 : A Space Odyssey . Wernher von Braun , around 1950 , proposed his own orbiting wheel . It was featured in Collier 's magazine and in a Walt Disney television episode , " Man in Space . " Von Braun also suggested a shuttle , a deltawinged space-plane that would ride to orbit atop an enormous rocket and then fly back through the atmosphere to land at an airport . During the 1960s studies had proceeded apace for both these concepts . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well advanced . The Nixon administration wanted NASA to follow up the Apollo lunar flights by launching a three-man station , Skylab . Skylab would not be wheel-shaped ; it would be the heavily modified upper stage of a Saturn V moon rocket . A somewhat similar manned rocket , known as the Saturn I-B , would carry astronaut crews to and from this station . NASA hoped eventually to build its twelve-man station as an enlarged counterpart of Skylab , also launched with a Saturn V. <p> But each flight of a Saturn I-B would cost $120 million , partly because its stages would fly only once and then fall uselessly into the Atlantic . Such a cost would be bearable for the limited demands of Skylab , but the twelveman station would call for a continuing stream of flights . In the words of Julian Franklin , a vice president at the aerospace firm of North American Rockwell , " Unless you had some kind of lowcost logistical supply system , you 'd eat up all your budget just supplying the station . " The supply system that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying over and over again like an airliner . <p> By 1970 NASA officials were proposing to develop the shuttle and the station simultaneously , at a cost of some $5 billion for each . These officials did suggest other uses for the shuttle , including launching and servicing of unmanned satellites , military reconnaissance , earth-observation studies , and rescue in space . But these were clearly secondary to its role in support of the twelve-man station and as a springboard to new manned adventures in space . <p> The " shuttle/station " concept was forthright enough , but it nearly killed both projects . Congressman Joseph Karth , a member of the House space committee and usually an ardent NASA supporter , claimed that the agency was seeking to win a piecemeal commitment to what he called " its ultimate objective " of sending men to Mars . During 1970 he introduced an amendment to block appropriations for the shuttle/station . It failed by the narrowest possible margin , a 5353 tie . In the Senate Walter Mondale introduced a similar amendment . It failed by 28 to 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did an aboutface on its justification for the shuttle . Instead of promoting its use for new manned flights , its officials asserted that the shuttle would save money for unmanned programs . They also " decoupled " the shuttle from the space station , giving it a separate budget designation and project staff . It now would stand or fall on its own merits . And NASA went shopping for customers to use it . <p> The Air Force was an obvious choice , but NASA needed that service 's business even more than the Air Force needed a new launch vehicle . As Air Force Secretary Robert Seamans told a 1971 congressional hearing , " I can not sit here today and say that the space transportation system is an essential military requirement . " He nevertheless agreed to give the shuttle both payloads and political support , but at a price , for NASA would have to design the vehicle to meet Air Force needs . That meant a delta wing to provide increased maneuverability and a payload bay with dimensions of sixty by fifteen feet , able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had not been in NASA 's original plans , but NASA was willing to accede . <p> Such artful dodges were not lost on the shuttle 's critics . " NASA has repeatedly changed its design , purpose and justification , " Mondale declared , " not to meet technological or scientific demands , but to make it politically salable . NASA desperately wants this multibillion-dollar project and will seek any rationale to justify its development . What we see , then , is a classic case of a program and agency in search of a mission . " He nevertheless was unable to rally any serious opposition in Congress , and his antishuttle amendments failed in the Senate by increasingly wide margins . Still , NASA faced an additional set of hurdles , from the Office of Management and Budget . <p> NASA argued that it faced a continuing and burdensome cost in the need to purchase expendable boosters , those Atlas , Titan , and Delta launch vehicles that were carrying unmanned spacecraft to orbit . But as the physicist Ralph Lapp pointed out , NASA had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The OMB therefore imposed two conditions . The first was that the shuttle must be inexpensive to develop , costing no more than one billion dollars per year . The second was that it must carry enough traffic cheaply enough to be cost-effective . NASA and its contractors set to work . <p> These contractors had been studying designs that would build the shuttle as a two-stage craft , with an airplane-like orbiter riding piggyback atop a winged booster larger than a Boeing 747 . Such a shuttle would be fully reusable , carrying all its propellant tanks within the two fuselages . But it would cost too much . The concept that replaced it , early in 1972 , was essentially the one that is flying today , with big solid-fueled booster for the first stage and the orbiter 's propellants in a large disposable tank . This approach represented a retreat from full reusability , but it offered a smaller orbiter and lower cost . The big propellant tank would be the only major throwaway item . It might well be relatively inexpensive , because it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal . And even the shells of the solid booster were to be recovered and reused . <p> To address the problem of cost-effectiveness , NASA engaged the consulting firm of Mathematica , Inc. , which concluded that NASA 's new shuttle design would meet the OMBs criteria if it made at least thirty flights per year . That seemed to offer plenty of margin , for in those halcyon days NASA 's leaders were freely predicting up to sixty a year . These same leaders declared that each such flight would cost no more than $10 million . With those figures President Nixon gave his assent to the program . The shuttle , he declared , would " take the astronomical cost out of astronautics . " The program was made . <p> The European Alternative <p> Meanwhile , Europe 's space leaders watched all this with keen interest . The shuttle , they saw , was to be all things to all people . To fill its payload bays , both NASA and the Air Force would phase out the use of their existing expendable launchers , putting all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French , the Europeans responded in 1973 by beginning the development of a competing launch vehicle , Ariane . It would be both large and unmanned , and though expendable would offer low launch costs with the help of government subsidies . Ariane would be there to pick up the pieces if the shuttle should falter . <p> In the meantime there was the matter of carrying through the shuttle program itself . The OMB 's cost criteria stood like an ax over the program ; any major overruns , any large falloff in its projected cost-effectiveness , could offer reason to kill it . But in 1979 the Air Force again came to the rescue . President Jimmy Carter had negotiated the SALT II arms-control treaty , which would demand the extensive use of reconnaissance satellites to monitor Soviet compliance . The shuttle would be essential for launching these spacecraft , and Gen. Lew Allen , the Air Force chief of staff , came out strongly in its support . This was a watershed . At last the shuttle could go forward not just on the basis of cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There remained the matter of dealing with those bothersome expendables . NASA 's strategy was to declare the shuttle operational after only four flights , late in 1982 , and thereafter to shift future payloads away from the expendables as rapidly as possible . By 1985 agency salesmen were briskly rounding up customers both in the United States and overseas , stating that the shuttle was " the most reliable , flexible and cost-effective launch system in the world , " with government-subsidized launch costs even lower than those for Ariane . The aerospace companies that were building the expendables , particularly General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas , found production of their launchers and were preparing to break up their engineering teams . Once that happened , the expendables would be lost virtually beyond recall . <p> Calamity <p> Then came 1986 and the Challenger disaster . It put the shuttle out of service for nearly three years . President Reagan responded with a new space policy , declaring that the shuttle no longer would serve all potential users . Instead it would be treated as a rare and valuable commodity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commercial users in particular , with their communications satellites , would be welcome to fly their craft aboard expendables . Those old launchersDelta , Atlas , and Titan-thus gained a new lease on life and a base of customers for which they could compete . But NASA 's long infatuation with the shuttle had so weakened them as to leave Europe with a sizable advantage . During 1989 and 1990 some thirty-five commercial payloads were scheduled for launch . Ten would ride aboard U.S. expendables ; virtually all the rest would fly on Ariane . <p> Where , then , does the shuttle stand today ? Far from flying sixty or even thirty times a year , the best it has done has been to make nine flights , in 1985 . Its promise of low cost has also gone aglimmering . In 1989 the Office of Technology Assessment estimated that shuttle launch costs " are likely to range between $250 and $500 million , depending on the actual number of flights per year . " Commercial launches on expendables , by contrast , were costing $40 to $60 million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force activities ? Even before the loss of Challenger , the Air Force-over strenuous NASA objections-announced plans to renew its purchases of Titan-class expendables . Since then it has made a major commitment to the Titan IV , which offers a payload of thirty-nine thousand pounds . The shuttle lifts forty-seven thousand , down from its originally advertised sixty-five-thousand . <p> Has NASA succeeded in pursuing a vigorous unmanned program , in addition to its manned activities ? To the contrary , its leaders have repeatedly slighted the unmanned efforts , starving them for support to free up funds for the shuttle . During the mid-1970s , for instance , the agency successfully landed two unmanned craft on the surface of Mars , which searched for life within that planet 's soil and sent back panoramic views of their surroundings . NASA might have sent more , but the money was n't there . And despite repeated requests from senior scientists , NASA declined to pursue any type of major initiative in building spacecraft for studies of the earth 's surface . <p> The notorious Hubble space telescope represented another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped mirror . The idea for a large telescope in orbit dated from the mid-1960s and had broad support among astronomers . They knew that turbulence within the earth 's atmosphere , which causes stars to twinkle , blurs and smears their images in conventional telescopes . An orbiting instrument , high above the air , could return images of unprecedented sharpness . But amid the financial demands of the shuttle , the space-telescope effort experienced repeated delays and reductions in program goals . These stringencies discouraged testing of components , which is why the mirror 's misshape went undetected until the telescope was already in orbit . <p> Has manned flight nevertheless attracted its own base of people , who rely on it to do useful work ? The answer is the contrary : Virtually every manned flight undertaken or planned has served the internal interests of NASA proper . It is true that the shuttle launched several commercial spacecraft , prior to 1986 . But those launches stemmed from NASA 's use of subsidy and monopoly to boost artificially the demand for shuttle flights . The subsidies undercut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling clients that they could have any launcher they liked , as long as it was the shuttle . It is little wonder that a growing stream of these clients sought an alternative in Ariane . <p> Few shuttle flights have specifically relied on the skills of astronauts . The 1990 recovery of the Long Duration Exposure Facility , an orbiting tab , is about the only one . A 1992 recovery and relaunch of a communications satellite was largely a costly exercise in public relations . Expendable rockets are so much cheaper than the shuttle that the user could have saved money by simply launching a replacement-if NASA had n't charged only $93 million for its service , even though the true cost was over half a billion dollars . <p> NASA also has pursued Spacelab , a research center carried in the shuttle 's payload bay that features a pressurized module , but Spacelab flew only four manned missions prior to 1992 , for durations of about a week , and only once between 1985 and 1992 . The reason is simple : Spacelab looked like a low-cost alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no competition . <p> How , overall , do U.S. space activities compare with those of Europe ? Ariane itself has had problems : it was out of service for several months in 1990 as a result of one of its own launch failures . But in 1989 the total European effort cost some $3 billion and put up ten satellites . The combined U.S. space program , Air Force and NASA together , spent $30 billion and launched 24 . By this measure the American program is a fraction as costeffective as Europe 's . <p> Has the shuttle supported manned ventures like a space station ? Quite to the contrary ; it has taken away funds that might have underwritten such a project . As early as 1973 the three-man Skylab was in orbit and operational , representing a station larger than the Soviets have ever launched . A second Skylab station was also built , along with the Saturn V that could have launched it . But for lack of funds , Skylab II went off to the Air and Space Museum , and the Saturn V wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been known to roost in it . <p> Since 1984 a major new NASA initiative has indeed pursued a space station . It currently stands as a four-person design , with an advertised cost of $30 billion , though William Broad of The New York Times notes that with its shuttle-supported operations the total cost will top $100 billion . From the perspective of Skylab this new project amounts to an attempt to do in the year 2000 , at enormous cost , what we disdained to do in 1975 with equipment that was already in hand . <p> The shuttle nevertheless is not without advantages . It carries more astronauts than the Apollo spacecraft . It can indeed carry Spacelab within its cargo bay . It also can retrieve a spacecraft from orbit , and in 1993 it is to undertake a mission that could install new equipment in the Hubble Space Telescope , to make amends for the misshapen main mirror . But achieving these new capabilities has cost much time and treasure . It is hard today to avoid concluding that we have gone forty ways around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much space capability as we had in 1970 . <p> In that year , in the wake of Apollo , NASA lacked a mandate to proceed with the manned adventures that had become its stock in trade . But with Skylab it had abundant opportunity to pursue a manned program that would rely on existing equipment , carrying out missions of long duration . Its fleet of expendables could launch anything from small science experiments to full-blown space stations , and many potential users were eager to build spacecraft that would fly aboard these rockets . NASA could have consolidated its activities with a policy of giving vigorous support to such users , offering the nation a space enterprise that would be both brilliant and daring . Instead it gave us the shuttle . <p> Eisenhower , with his support of both expendables and unmanned spacecraft , planted a sturdy tree that could grow to serve the nation . Kennedy 's Project Apollo , by contrast , was a hothouse plant that would wither as soon as the nourishing flows of money dried up . Yet even Apollo brought the prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed under its aegis . The shuttle , by contrast , has proven to be a trap , a trap born of NASA 's following the false star of manned flight . <p> Manned space flight was a technology much in vogue in Washington but in no demand elsewhere . NASA did n't impose on itself the discipline of supporting the people who wanted unmanned flights ; the agency took the easy way out : subsidies , monopoly . It received little criticism from a public that admired its astronauts , and not much more from Presidents and Congresses that valued it as a high-tech jobs program . With this the space agency fell prey to the classic ills that can afflict any unfettered government organ : sclerosis , loss of integrity , empire building . The conquest of space was a beautiful dream , but so was socialism . <p> PHOTO : Astronaut Brusce McCandless II takes an untethered walk from the Challenger in 1984 . <p> PHOTOS ( 3 ) : Space <p> PHOTO : The original seven astronauts of the Mercury program , 1962 . <p> PHOTO : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> PHOTO : The Space Shuttle Atlantis thunders skyward at the Kennedy Space Center , 1991 . <p> By T.A .
