<p> Autumn comes in all colors , even here , where honey golds mingle with coppery reds to mark the change of seasons . <p> You do n't have to go to Vermont to find radiant blue skies on a sparkling Sunday in October . There are lots of crunchy leaves to kick around in the state parks and along lake trails . The days are still warm enough to leave your sweater in the car . <p> At 5 p.m. , you wrap it around your shoulders and find the best spot to watch the hills fade into a topaz sky , with no fog to obstruct the view . On the way home the sky darkens , living room lights come on and fireplaces are lighted , bringing the bouquet of oak and apple wood to the air . <p> You do n't have to travel far to find a lineup of oaks with as much bravado as a stand of New Hampshire maples . OK , there are more of them back East , but we appreciate them more here . <p> Big-leaf maples flourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lakes . In the late afternoon when the sunlight angles in through the trees , the juxtaposition of amber leaves against redwood bark is a photographer 's delight , and it 's good for the soul , too . <p> OAKS PUT ON A SHOW <p> Black oaks , with their enormous , curving black limbs , turn yellow in the fall . We 've got white oaks , red oaks and blue oaks , elms , liquidambar , sugar maples and aspen , all of which turn yellow or red . <p> When you have to put a sweater on in the morning , that 's a good indicator that photosynthesis has stopped in deciduous plants and the change of color is imminent . Greens fade and the underlying pigments emerge . They were just masked by the chlorophyll during the growth season . <p> Like a rainbow or a wild orchid , the spectacle is fleeting . The next two to four weeks is the optimal time to walk among the gold or red trees and reddening grapevines . The nights need to be nippy , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall colors . <p> Freezing kills the leaves before pigments reach their peak . A combination of cool nights and decreasing light triggers color changes in the trees . <p> The best part is the way they take you by surprise . After long stretches of dry brown hills and evergreens , suddenly , a treat . <p> A drive through the Valley of the Moon , up Highway 12 toward Glen Ellen , winds through typical Northern California terrain , but then , out of the corner of your eye , you spy red . Red trees , a whole slew of them on Arnold Drive , at the Sonoma Developmental Center , a home for the developmentally disabled . <p> " That little drive though the Developmental Center is always a favorite of mine , " says Matt Atkinson , a ranger at Jack London State Park in Glen Ellen . <p> Turn off Highway 12 on Madrone Road , drive to Arnold Drive and make a right . Both sides of the road are lined with pin oaks and red oaks . They are a stunning shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me it reminds them of home , " Atkinson says . <p> COLORS IN ROSS <p> Shady Lane in Ross is full of oaks and elms that turn golden in the fall . Huddart Park in Woodside has lots of big-leaf maples along the creek trails . Bracken ferns , ubiquitous in the Bay Area , turn deep yellow ; they are all over the place , but they seem particularly stunning in Yosemite , where they grow up between the gray granite stones , creating a color combination no decorator could ever top . <p> Geyserville , Cloverdale and all around the Russian River should be pretty in the next few weeks . After grape-crushing time in the Napa and Sonoma Valleys , the vines still have something left to show for their efforts in their red leaves . In a few weeks the acres of grapevines along Highway 12 through Sonoma , or Highway 29 through the Napa Valley , should have turned a rich , dark red . <p> Do n't laugh , but some of the most vivid reds anywhere come from our native poison oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's quite spectacular , really the best color of all the natives , in my opinion , " says landscape architect Glen Rogers , a member of the California Native Plant Society . <p> There 's tons of it along the stream trails in Tilden Park in Berkeley , and in Big Basin State Park north of Santa Cruz and in many other Bay Area regional parks . It 's lovely , but still highly poisonous , no matter what color it is . <p> A safer place to stroll is Nevada City , about 60 miles northeast of Sacramento . It is n't around the corner , but by all accounts , it is usually the best place for fall color in the West . Orange , red , gold , even purple , show up here . <p> Nevada City and Grass Valley are historic gold mining towns with broad streets , Victorian-era architecture and white church steeples . From Interstate 5 , take Highway 49 . Picturesque is one word that springs to mind . <p> In 1850 , more than 10,000 optimistic adventurers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . They also brought with them trees . Sugar maples and liquidambars , mostly , to remind them of where they came from . <p> But a long , hot summer has made for a less spectacular show this year than in years past , say some longtime residents . The colors may peak earlier than usual this year , probably by this weekend or next . The person who answered the phone at the Nevada City Chamber of Commerce advised walking or driving through the residential districts rather than downtown for the best fall color . " <p> " It 's still hotter than usual here , and some of the trees are turning brown quicker , and the colors are not quite as vibrant , but still worth seeing , " said an employee at Downey House , a bed and breakfast in Nevada City . <p> " The two crepe myrtle trees right in front of the house are golden torches right now , " said Deborah Dane , owner of the Parsonage Bed and Breakfast in downtown Nevada City . " It 's not like 1986 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beautiful color now . " <p> Who says Northern California has no seasons ? <p> FINDING THE COLORS <p> Here are some other suggestions for fall color hikes , walks and drives both near and far : <p> BAY AREA <p> * Tilden Park , Berkeley : Best colors are along the Jewel Lake walk . If you like , continue past Jewel Lake on Wildcat Creek Trail . <p> * Huddart Park , Woodside : Find the meadow area at the bottom of park , leave the car and walk through the meadow to the Richards Road trail . Take Richards Road along West Union Creek , a 2 1/2-mile hike . You can make it a loop by taking the Crystal Springs trail back around . It 's all flat . <p> To get to the park , take Highway 280 to Woodside Road , go west on Woodside Road and then right on Kings Mountain Road , 2.2 miles to park entrance . Entrance fee . <p> * Edgewood County Park and Preserve , Woodside : Take the Sylvan Loop trail from the parking lot to Serpentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the best colors are . Maps are available from a box at the entrance to the park . <p> Take Highway 280 to Edgewood Road exit . Go east to the park entrance opposite Crestview Drive . <p> SIERRA WALKS <p> Because of a cold snap early this month , the peak for colors is early this year , probably this weekend and next . <p> * Tahoe Rim Trail , Spooner Summit , Nevada : Located off Highway 50 heading east toward Carson City . A pull-off is on the north side of the road near the Spooner Summit elevation sign . Marking the trail head will be a Tahoe Rim Trail bulletin board , west of the pull-off . Trail goes in 13 miles , with a moderate grade of 10 percent . SCENIC FALL DRIVES  --  Hope Valley : Junction of highways 88 and 89 , Picketts Junction , east of Carson Pass . <p> * Sonora Pass : Highway 108 from Sonora Pass to the junction at Highway 395 . A scenic stop along this route is Kennedy Meadows between Pinecrest and Sonora Pass . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Stay in the left lane for the Crystal Basin Recreation Area , Ice House Road . About a mile before Ice House Resort , you pass though a beautiful stand of alders and aspens that fortunately escaped the horrendous fires of two years ago .
