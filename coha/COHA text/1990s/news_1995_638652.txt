<p> He bridges all the gaps . Sausalito to San Francisco , San Jose to Berkeley , San Francisco to Oakland , Al Davis to Ed DeBartolo Jr. , Nob Hill to the barrios , the Niners to the Raiders , Cliff Branch to Tim Brown , and the greatest gap of all Los Angeles to Oakland . <p> There may be nobody in professional football who can straddle like Jim Plunkett . <p> The former Heisman Trophy winner from Stanford who grew up in the Bay Area led the Oakland Raiders to the last Super Bowl championship ever won by an American Football Conference team ( 1983 season ) . Plunkett made the infamous move from Oakland to L.A. with the team and now works as a voice of the Raiders on their expansive radio network . <p> But he 's not much help as a visionary . <p> If you ask Plunkett if there is any way that today 's Raiders from Los Angeles , after 13 years away from it , can be anything like the old Oakland Raiders , he 's not sure how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " he said . " It 's a different time . Nothing 's really like it used to be . " <p> What used to be , most longtime National Football League fans will remember , was a renegade roster of colorful characters who did n't beat the other teams so much as they mugged them . They had nicknames like " Tooz , " " the Snake , " the " Mad Stork , " and " the Assassin . " They hung out in pool halls , and their fans came to their games on motorcycles . <p> " We had so many distinct personalities , " Plunkett said . " I mean , do n't forget some of the other guys like Lester Hayes and Lyle Alzado . The list just goes on and on just a long list of of guys that I do n't know if there 's any way they can ever duplicate that . <p> " But they can certainly duplicate the style of play they have the players for that . " <p> Another thing they 'll have , Plunkett said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " They have n't changed , not appreciably , and neither has the city of Oakland , " Plunkett said . <p> " There 's going to be more of a corporate presence , just because ticket prices are higher , but I was just there for that first exhibition game against the Rams and , yeah , it 's basically the same fan base . " <p> Oakland fans are not to be confused with Niners fans . There is a separation there that has held throughout the 13-year absence of the Raiders , and if anything their hearts have grown even fonder . That 's why 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo 's claims of franchise infringement on the territory of his Niners is " completely unfounded , " Plunkett said . " You 're talking about two completely different groups of people . They were both here before . One happened to leave , the other one did n't want them back . " <p> In time , the old Oakland Coliseum will be refurbished and brought up to date to provide Al Davis with luxury boxes to pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those revenues with other owners . <p> But for now even the stadium remains unchanged , sitting a few feet below sea level where the footing can easily be made a little heavier for slow-footed opponents . <p> " I do n't think there 's any question that - for a change - they 'll definitely have a home-field advantage . Everybody in the stadium will be rooting for the same team . Other teams wo n't want to go in there because they wo n't be able to hear their quarterback that kind of thing . Who knows , there may be times when they 'll water down the field to slow down the other teams just like the old days . " <p> Those things , Plunkett said , will be easily recaptured . <p> What might be more difficult is duplicating the style of play that was once the Raiders ' trademark . <p> " Well , you know , a lot of the rules have changed , " Plunkett said . " The league has cracked down on some of the things that we got away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away with that . But the fierceness , the intimidation , the visiting teams not wanting to come to the coliseum yeah , I think they can duplicate that . " <p> But characters ? <p> Real Raiders , guys who bleed Silver and Black ? <p> " Well , I do n't know about any characters on this team , but yeah , I think there are a lot of real Raiders , " Plunkett said . " I think they 're real Raiders for a lot of different reasons . <p> " I guess if you 're looking for characters Nolan Harrison is a little different . He dies his hair and stuff , and Ed Wiesnewski , he 's definitely a Raiders type in the offensive line , kind of a blue-collar guy with an attitude . <p> " On the other hand , there are some great players , like Tim Brown , that remind you of the great players we had back then . There 's no question , he 's a real Raider . " <p> There may be those who would question Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year that he tried to get hired by the Denver Broncos and it was just this year that he said " Superman could coach the Raiders , and it would n't make any difference , " if Davis did n't shelve his antiquated offense and let the new coach , Mike White , coach . <p> But Brown , and quarterback Jeff Hostetler , whose sideline rebellion played no small part in the firing of Art Shell , are not unlike such Raiders legends Marcus Allen and Ken Stabler , Plunkett said . <p> To be a Raider is to be outspoken . <p> Hostetler , a free-agent acquisition two years ago , probably has n't been on the roster long enough to be a real Raider , yet , Plunkett said , but if he is n't , he 's awful close . <p> " It 's hard to say , " Plunkett said . " But he 's tough-minded , you know , and they like him . His teammates really like him , because he gives his all every time he 's out there . But you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of doing that . " <p> But if Hostetler and Brown think the Raiders are ever going to abandon Davis ' beloved " vertical game , " Plunkett said , they do n't know Al Davis . <p> " Oh , I 've heard all the talk , " he said . " It 's the same old thing . I mean every year , when I was there , we 'd experiment with other stuff . We 'd go to training camp and put in a short-yardage passing game . <p> " But Al Davis is not paying these guys the amount of money he 's paying them to run 3-yard outs . They 're still going to put the ball down the field . There 's no question in my mind about that . <p> " I do n't know if its part of ' the Raider Mystique ' or whatever , but it 's definitely a big part of the tradition . " <p> What never will be part of the tradition , Plunkett said , are the Los Angeles years . <p> " For those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Raiders , it was really tough , " Plunkett said . <p> Even after his playing days , when he moved into the press box , he could n't say , " Los Angeles Raiders , " without choking on the words , " so I 've always just said , ' The Raiders . ' <p> " I was one of those who did n't want to leave to begin with , " Plunkett said . " But I went and it really was n't that bad in the beginning . <p> " Initially , they welcomed us with open arms . They welcomed us with open arms and , really , for the time I was on the team , we performed in front of a lot of full houses . <p> " But in the last several years , that enthusiasm really dwindled . Los Angeles went through a lot of down times with rioting and earthquakes and the stadium thing was always an issue because Al never got what he was promised and then it got badly damaged in that big one . <p> " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fan fickleness . L.A. 's a tough market . Unless you 're winning week-in and week-out , you 're not going to continue to draw . " <p> That , of course , was never a problem in Oakland in the old days when the love for the Raiders was truly unconditional . With a new generation of Raiders fans , that too , could be different . <p> " I do n't really think so , " Plunkett said . " I mean just from what I 've seen so far , it seems like it 's already back like it used to be with the fans . <p> " But on the other hand , I also see a lot of high expectations . Coming back , all the money that 's been committed there 's going to be a lot of pressure to win and most of it seems to be on Mike White . <p> " These people have been waiting a long time for this .
