As your guidance counselor , I have to ask the hard questions , such as " Is college right for you ? " and " Which college is right for you ? " and " Are n't guidance and counsel the same thing , when you think about it ? " You 'll find the answers to these and other questions in this informative new guide by the authors of Smoking Stunts Your Growth and So You Wan na Be a Chiropractor ? Enjoy . // IS COLLEGE RIGHT FOR YOU ? // If you think college is all fun and games , well , you got that right . College is all fun and games  --  or can be , if you play your cards right . And you can learn to play your cards right at UNLV , which offers a course called Mathematics of Casino Games . Which is not to say that college is all about keno and baccarat . On the contrary : College is also very much about flag floopball ( football using a Nerf ball ) , which you can play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American institution of higher learning , you can earn a bowling scholarship ( Wichita State ) . Or take a course in coaching football ( Florida page 84 and elsewhere ) . Or compete in an intramural chili cook-off ( Boise State ) . Or play 36 holes a day on campus ( dozens of schools ) . Or practically take root in a sports bar called Bubba 's II ( page 84 ) . Or just sit in your dorm room all day and watch ESPN in your underwear . All of which is why they call it a bachelor 's degree . In short , if you like to play sports , watch sports or study sports ( in preparation for an exciting career in sports ) ; if you believe that athletic scholarship is a redundancy , ranking right up there with guidance counselor ; if you enjoy the kind of tailgating , Yale-baiting , cheerleading , beer-bleeding sports scene that only a college campus can provide , then college is most certainly for you . // But not just any college will do . You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCHOOL ? // A Jock School is any college or university in which sports are central to campus life , a place where sports-minded students can flourish . Stanford is a Jock School . Princeton is a Jock School . Cal is Jock School . Which is to say , you can get a world-class education at a Jock School , just as you can get a salad at McDonald 's . But that 's not why you go there , is it ? // No , in selecting the proper Jock School for you , academics are , well ... academic . Pay no attention to the library , unless it was built by the guy who founded Nike ( page 82 ) . Ask not " Are tutors available for remedial study ? " but rather " Are the song girls available for private parties ? " ( They are at USC , though the band comes with them . ) Why fill that pointy head of yours with fancy book-learnin ' when you could be watching baseball at Mississippi State 's remarkable Dudy Noble Field ( page 84 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly your dudy. // " Education , " somebody once said , " is what remains after you have forgotten everything you have learned . " To which an educated person might say " b.s. , " which does not , in this instance , stand for bachelor of science . Instead , what remains after you have forgotten everything you have learned in college is ... a moth-eaten letter sweater ... your football season tickets ... a rooting interest in the NCAA basketball tournament ... a trick knee you wrecked at the rec center ... a lifetime of writing booster checks ... a police record from Sugar Bowl weekend , 1958 ... your cheerleader wife ... your quarterback husband ... photographs that will prevent you from ever seeking public office ( Nude Olympics , page 74 ) . // Sports , not academics , provide the public face for a university . As Bear Bryant said , " It 's kind of hard to rally around a math class . " Writer Christopher Buckley notes in his book Wry Martinis that Spanish dictator Francisco Franco died three days before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eve of the game , three Yale students scrambled up onto a prominent billboard near campus and painted the following : // NOV. 19  --  FRANCO NOV. 22  --  HARVARD // When the youths descended from the sign , they were apprehended by waiting New Haven policemen , one of whom asked ( presumably while fingering his nightstick ) : " O.K. , which one of you guys is Franco ? " // The point is , there 's a limited audience for intellectual pursuits , but everybody knows football . // SO WHICH JOCK SCHOOL IS RIGHT FOR ME ? // Thought you 'd never ask . In the following pages we rate the nation 's top Jock Schools , using a mathematical formula slightly more complicated than particle physics and not nearly as much fun to read about . // Suffice it to say that we evaluated all 305 NCAA Division I men 's basketball schools on a variety of criteria : intramural sports , the number of varsity teams , percentage of students who participate in athletics of any kind , national championships won . on-campus athletic facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sports-related curricula , student-run sports media , rivalries , bands , cheerleaders , sports bars , proximity to pro franchises , creative Hook ' em Horns-style hand signals , etc . Each of these elements was assigned a point value , those numbers were added , and that figure was then divided by the square root of Beano Cook 's hat size . Points were deducted for any number of reasons : if a school 's football team fielded felons , for instance , or if its campus is located , in whole or in part , in the state of New Jersey . // The result is the first irrefutable ranking of the best sports schools in America  --  equal parts math , science and sociology . Not that you can trust our math , science and sociology skills . We all went to Jock Schools , where we studied to become sportswriters.
