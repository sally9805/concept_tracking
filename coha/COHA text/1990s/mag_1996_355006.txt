The news of Admiral Jeremy Boorda 's suicide passes through the **26;4149;TOOLONG machine : <P> Stage 1 : Anger ( upon hearing the bulletin ) . God damn the media , anyway ! <P> Murray Kempton said the task of editorial writers is to come down out of the hills after the battle is over to shoot the wounded . Is it the job of jackboot reporters in this country to conduct house-to-house searches , ransacking private lives for every disreputable little secret , driving quarry to such humiliation that their only refuge is self-destruction ? Shame on my profession ! To hell with its venal careerism , its hypocrisy , its prurience , its pietistic ruthlessness . <P> Stage 2 : Denial . Or , anyway , incredulity , and stray questions . <P> Was the admiral consciously , advertently guilty of the lie ? Apparently so . <P> A strange mess : Everyone 's worst fear ( being found out ) enacted in a flash tragedy . Why did he wear two V-for-valor pins ? Two seems to be piling it on a bit thick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second iteration , to make it convincing ? <P> Why , in any case , would a man who had ascended to such high rank require these small , phony proclamations of martial virtue to be pinned above his chest hair ? Because he started out so low in rank ? Why wear tokens asserting that years ago he was somewhere  --  in combat in Vietnam  --  where it could so easily be proved that he was not ? <P> Then a pettifogging voice in the back of the mind speaks up : But he was near the fighting , was he not , on station in the South China Sea , in the theater of war , anyway ? <P> The sadly practical question that mystifies everyone : Why did he take his life over something that he probably could have explained away after some necessary minor embarrassment ? He could have apologized , said it was an unintentional mistake , a technical mix-up of the fruit salad . He might have offered his resignation to the President , which the President might then , with a gracefully deprecating remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time between two professions , the journalistic and the military , to determine whose behavior violated what standards . <P> One 's first intemperate disgust at the media for pursuing the admiral even to his death , his ritual shame , his seppuku , erupted behind the question : Who cares ? Who gives a damn if he wore a couple of battle decorations he should not have ? <P> The answer , of course , is that those men who did serve in combat in Vietnam must care about it and must consider it an affront , not only to their service but to the sacrifices made in an ill-conceived war by the 57,600 Americans who died in it and the hundreds of thousands more who left arms and legs and sometimes pieces of their sanity in Vietnam . It is self-evident that no one who had not earned the decorations for valor in battle should have worn them , least of all the Navy 's top officer . <P> If the poet laureate of England ( Tennyson , say , in the days when the post and poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be an interesting cultural scandal . To wear the valor decorations , as Boorda did , amounted to a kind of moral plagiarism  --  a theft of other men 's honor , and therefore a debasing of the coin rewarding their courage .
