When package designer Marc Rosen plans trips now , he always asks his travel agent about hotels with the best discounts . Rosen , whose clients include Colgate-Palmolive and Rayovac batteries , favors expensive Old World palaces . But he says it just is n't chic anymore to pay outrageous sums for hotels . He does n't have to . For a trip to Paris he grabbed a 45%-off special at the four-star Grand Hotel Inter-Continental . Says Rosen : " I do n't want to sacrifice lifestyle and image since I invite clients up . The trick is to find an image hotel with special prices . " Meet today 's business traveler  --  tough , smart , and like any other obsessive shopper , always on the lookout for a deal . Complains Jonathan Tisch , 38 , head of Loews Hotels : " They are beating us up at the front desk . " Hoteliers like Tisch are getting clobbered by pricing that is a couple of floors below the posted tariff , or " rack rate , " and sometimes 40% under the corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lieu of pounds , a gracious 42% discount . In Asia , where price breaks are as rare as Chevrolets , promotions are popping up . It is a buyer 's market out there in hotel land , particularly in the U.S. , where a five-year slump caused by overbuilding has shattered the industry 's pricing . Says hotel consultant Stephen W. Brener : " For the first time in history , the customer has an absolute understanding that the industry 's rack rate is n't real . " In this menage a trois of corporations , hotels , and travelers , each party has staked out a new rooming strategy : * Corporate travel managers are bypassing their counterparts at the big hotel chains and bedding down extra bargains at individual locations . They are also concentrating their buying in fewer travel agencies , a tactic that makes it easier to enforce travel policy , saving more money . * Travelers , too , know they have the upper hand and are taking advantage of the industry 's troubles . Just for the asking , you can often wrangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , even though your reservation is booked for a standard room at the corporate rate . It also pays to read the frequent-flier mail and look for promotions aimed at tourists . * The lodging industry 's plan is to stay alive until 1995 , when the surplus of rooms will diminish . Amid their own corporate restructurings , some hoteliers are skimping on sheets and towels , eliminating amenities , and dishing out smaller food portions in a somewhat desperate effort to contain costs . Corporate travel managers , under the recessionary hammer to corral costs , have been busy . During 1991 even the most discount-resistant hotels yielded to the competitive pressure . Since the mid-1980s , when vacancy rates started to climb , companies like AT &T; and General Electric began flexing their muscles to get lower rates for volume business . As the industry weakened , corporations were able to turn the screws , nabbing 40% or more off the posted room rates . At some high-vacancy locations , hotel managers ignore their company 's carefully crafted rate schemes and negotiate cheaper tariffs directly with corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is based in London and includes Paris 's ritzy George V and New York City 's Plaza Athenee , is that corporate discounts are never larger than 15% , no matter how much volume is guaranteed . Yet Kelvin Houchin , senior vice president of sales and marketing for the Americas , admits that he would be " naive " to think all his hotel managers were sticking to that policy . At the charming King Edward Hotel , a Forte property in the center of Toronto 's financial district , general manager Bill Croke recently surrendered a 40% price break plus free upgrades to a corporation that guaranteed 1,100 room-nights annually . Explains Croke : " Two years ago we did n't feel it was necessary to discount because customers were still knocking at the door . Last year our occupancy dropped 20% , down to the 50s  --  and it is not climbing . " Shrewd negotiators like AT &T's; transportation manager Russell DeAngelo sign contracts with hotels that ensure the company will always get the best rate . If a hotel runs a distress sale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower price . American Express , the largest travel agent , says that formerly most big companies typically used many agencies . " That dilutes the buying power of the company , " says Roger Ballou , president of American Express Travel Services Group . Ballou , who admittedly has some fish to fry , claims American Express always finds that by reducing the number of agents , a company can save money . In 1986 , AT &T; reduced the number of agencies it used from 311 to just three : Carlson Travel , Thomas Cook , and Amex . AT &T; wo n't reveal the exact savings but says they are substantial . With fewer agencies , a company has an easier time tracking miscreants who try to bend the rules . Says transportation manager DeAngelo : " The agency will let us know that employee X was told to stay in a hotel where we have the negotiated rate but instead selected one that cost $50 more . " Many employers fail to capture savings because they do not enforce their travel policies . In the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as travel budgets get tighter , reluctance is giving way to necessity . Successful enforcers resort to a blatant form of persuasion : Travel directors send monthly reports of abuses to the culprits ' immediate bosses . Consolidation within the agency business and the creation of huge travel networks allow companies and individuals the advantage of size without the loss of personal attention . The local agency may look like a cubbyhole , but mom and pop shops have rapidly been joining big consortiums like Hickory Travel Systems and Woodside Travel Management . That 's a blessing for smaller firms that do not have the muscle to get substantial price reductions . Woodside , for example , says it gets cuts of up to 40% below rack rates with 1,500 hotels worldwide . Whatever the sophistication of travel agencies , it pays to be a knowledgeable consumer . Individuals , particularly frequent fliers , can still find ways to reduce both leisure and business travel costs . Does the guy checking in before you have a better rate ? It never hurts to ask the desk clerk for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says consultant Brener . " Some have as many as 20 rates for the same room . " Promotions are particularly fleeting . The key is to lasso the lowest one with the largest amount of amenities piled on . Packages labeled " winter , " " summer , " and " weekend " are generally great buys . For the downtown Los Angeles Hyatt , a reservationist offered a $99 special , $90 off the rack and $70 less than the corporate rate . A few miles away in the heart of Beverly Hills , the Hilton has a $145 BounceBack special , including a continental breakfast , a $75 saving  --  if the traveler can stay over Saturday night . So if the marketing chief arrives on Thursday and must remain over the weekend , this package is ideal . At the downtown Los Angeles Hilton , the BounceBack rate of $95 includes a continental breakfast and an upgrade to the best available room . Frequent fliers can sometimes get a double-dip discount . Many of the major airlines , for instance , give away bonus coupons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupons for hotels to its frequent fliers who have accumulated 20,000 miles . Participating hotels include the Hilton , Hyatt , Inter-Continental , Westin , and Kempinski chains . If your travel agent books with Kempinski , say , for rates 40% below those posted , you may get that price cut , plus another 50% off by presenting your airline coupon . For overseas travelers , hotels from London to Hong Kong are putting up " Yankee Come Back " signs . During and after the Gulf war , American executives stayed home and conducted business by phone , fax , and videoconference . " Before the war , occupancy rates at the Four Seasons in London were in the 80s , but the war cut that in half , " says John B. Richards , senior vice president of marketing . Some posh hotels in London and other European cities that cater to Americans were reportedly near empty during the first quarter of 1991 . The Rank Organisation 's five hotels in London announced a dollars-for-pounds promotion in February 1991 , and the offer has been extended through August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are invited to pay that figure in dollars . At Rank 's five-star Royal Garden Hotel in London , a shillings throw from Kensington Palace , home of Prince Charles and Princess Di , guests can get a room with a view of Hyde Park for $151 . The-top-of-the-line room , which includes 24-hour butler service , can be let for an extra $25 . An undersold feature of the hotel : fortuitous sightings of the royal couple . The " great affordables " package advertised by a marketing group called Leading Hotels of the World includes a host of frills like free champagne and breakfast , and and a price break at many hotels , including Claridge 's and the Savoy in London and the Hotel de Crillon in Paris . Importantly , the lower rate often includes all taxes . South American hotels , limping from raging inflation and worldwide recession , have been hurt by a crime wave that prompted the U.S. government to issue travel advisories for Brazil and Colombia . The five-star Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro lowered prices twice during 1991 as occupancy plummeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveler likely can be upgraded to a $290 suite at the Copacabana with a balcony that faces the beach . Discounting has generally been anathema to Asian hoteliers , but they have been stung by the double whammy of Tiananmen Square and the Gulf war . After the Tiananmen massacre in Beijing , hotels in Hong Kong and other Asian cities experienced a considerable dip in business from North American guests , many of whom make stopovers going to and from China . The Shangri-La Hotels &; Resorts group set a corporate rate for the first time in 1992 and is promoting incentive packages for its 19 hotels . The Island Shangri-La in Hong Kong now has a corporate rate of $270 for rooms with a commanding view of the harbor , a saving of $70 . For summer and winter specials , those rooms let for about $190 . Hotel executives have had to learn to chop costs while maintaining service , and in the U.S. they 've had years of practice . Even before the Gulf war and recession stymied travel , the industry was suffering from the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed properties and sold them to eager investors  --  hey , real estate ca n't miss , right ?  --  and took back management contracts without enough regard for demand . Occupancy rates of U.S. hotels slipped steadily from a high of 71% in 1979 to 60.9% in 1991 . Analyst Bjorn Hanson of Coopers &; Lybrand estimates that the breakeven occupancy rate for most hotels is about 66% and that only 32% of full-service hotels in the U.S. managed to do that last year . The other 68% were in the red , and the industry 's total loss was a walloping $3.4 billion . Companies such as Marriott have had to restructure  --  selling hotels and other businesses and reducing headquarters staff . So many debt-plagued hotel owners have been unable to pay their mortgages , notes consultant Brener , that U.S. government agencies own or have interests in more hotels than any other institution does . With the industry crawling , hotel room prices inched up only 1.7% in 1991 and have not kept pace with inflation since 1989 . " Hotels are the cheapest they have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates that the the average discount last year for U.S. hotels was 27% . Hotels everywhere are cutting corners to keep the doors open and rates low . Just two years ago , the biggest trend in the hotel industry was to stock bathrooms with enough toiletries to fill an apothecary 's shelf . Now , some of the industry 's heavyweights are scaling back those expensive little extras . Says Hyatt Hotels President Darryl Hartley-Leonard : " It had reached the point of amenity lunacy out there . " Sewing kits were eliminated in Marriott 's full-service hotels , as were body lotion , sponges , and hair conditioner in some places . The company will not reveal the total saving , but analyst Hanson estimates that hotels are spending $1.50 less per night per room than in 1988 . Hyatt Hotels now places fewer towels in bathrooms , a yearly savings of $2 million , and it has switched from cream-colored sheets to white , which bleaches another $1 million . All that cream-colored dye adds up . In addition , Hyatt 's VIPs are now picked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hilton no longer gives out fresh bars of soap every day to guests who check in for several days , food portions have been downsized , and 16% of the corporate staff has been eliminated . Even the ritziest hotels are finding ways to skimp . Caroline Hunt 's Rosewood Hotels , which includes Dallas 's Mansion on Turtle Creek and the new , amenity-stuffed Lanesborough in London , consolidated purchases with one or two manufacturers and saved $15,000 last year just on toilet paper . To keep from raising prices , the Italian branch of Orient Express Hotels , where the rooms run $500 per night , has reduced the size of soap bars from 100 to 40 grams . The general manager of the Hotel Splendido in Portofino reports that big bouquets of flowers have given way to one or two stems . When guests stay longer than one night , only the top sheet is changed daily . Most travelers do n't feel short-sheeted by the lack of goodies . Pleased with discounts of 40% or more , they are not likely to quibble about an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long will these good times roll for the business traveler ? Lodging experts say for another two or three years . By then many dilapidated properties will be removed from the market . And since most bankers would laugh out loud at the thought of underwriting new hotel construction , the supply of rooms wo n't grow . The era of " distressed rates , " as Hilton Hotels President Carl Mottek calls it , will end . So enjoy the low prices while you can , but have a heart and do n't steal the towels . These guys have enough problems as it is . <p>
