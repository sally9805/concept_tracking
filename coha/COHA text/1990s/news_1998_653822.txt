<p> As an afternoon thunderstorm splashed their pasture , a small herd of alpacas trotted toward shelter under the overhanging roof of a nearby barn . <p> Some , kids only a few weeks old , were about the size of large dogs ; others , full grown , stood nearly five feet tall with their long necks erect . Their dense , velvety fleeces made up a fashionable palette of earth tones  --  white , tan , brown , gray . <p> " This is Cleopatra , " said Charles E. Stewart , presenting a female with dark facial markings that look like too much eyeliner . " This is Summer Rain . She 's due any day . And this is Vixen , and this is Calliope . " <p> The gentle animals milling sociably around Mr. Stewart seemed like exotic pets , but , as a growing number of people are finding , breeding alpacas can be a profitable business . Some of his animals , Mr. Stewart said , are worth more than $20,000 . <p> " You do n't have to do very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most jobs , " he said . <p> Mr. Stewart , 56 , has been a rancher for less than five years . Three years ago , he quit a job as administrator of a medical clinic to devote himself full time to his Colorado spread , 40 hilly acres on the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains , about 50 miles south of Denver . <p> He and his wife , Helen M. Stewart , a pediatrician , are among more than 1,000 alpaca owners in the United States , where a growing national herd now numbers about 15,000 head . Some of them keep the animals mainly as pets or because their coats provide silky , luxurious fiber for knitting or weaving . But increasing numbers of owners are breeding them for profit . <p> " They 're very lucrative , " Mr. Stewart said . " The supply is very low and the demand is high . " <p> Distantly related to the camel and a smaller first cousin of the South American llama , alpacas are native to Peru , Bolivia and Chile . The animals were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 's by American breeders looking to capitalize on the alpacas ' novelty . Alpaca wool  --  unlike the coarser fiber yielded by llama fleece  --  has long been prized in Europe as a luxurious fashion fabric . In the United States , the fiber is still used mainly in artisanal weaving and knitting , but owners have formed a fiber cooperative with the goal of expanding the market for their animals ' fleece . <p> For now , however , the most profitable aspect of commercial alpaca husbandry in the United States is breeding the animals for sale . <p> Mr. Stewart sold 18 alpacas last year , 10 of them breeding-quality females with an average price of $18,000 , he said . His breeding-quality males bring around $5,000 apiece . He paid an average of $24,000 each for four pregnant females he bought this year . <p> Female alpacas , with a gestation period of about 335 days , can bear one cria , or kid , a year . They remain fertile for 20 years or more . <p> Alpaca breeders can take advantage of the same tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breeding animals , according to Mr. Stewart , who is chairman of the marketing committee of the Alpaca Owners and Breeders Association , in Estes Park , Colo . <p> The alpaca association has 1,550 members , up from 146 in 1991 . Mr. Stewart said about a quarter of them are " wannabes " who do not own any animals yet , and most of the rest have fewer than 20 animals . <p> " It 's an extremely young industry , " said Mr. Stewart , whose marketing committee was formed last year to spread the word about alpacas and their business possibilities . <p> Kenneth Hobert , the association 's business manager , said the alpaca herd in the United States has grown steadily at better than 20 percent a year for the last several years . <p> " The alpaca is easy to take care of , " Mr. Hobert said from his office in Estes Park . " It 's good for children ; it makes for a good life-style situation . " <p> Many alpaca owners start off small , with just a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hobert said . " Then they begin marketing to other people . " <p> Much of that is by word of mouth or on the Internet . Breeders can advertise in Alpacas , the association 's quarterly magazine ( the summer issue carried more than 120 ads ) , and some show their animals in the growing number of alpaca exhibitions around the country , many mounted in conjunction with llama shows . <p> Like purebred horses , most alpacas have pedigrees that can increase the animals ' value for breeders . As of July 3 , Alpaca Registry Inc. , a private , industry-supported organization , had registered 16,846 live alpacas in the United States and Canada , about eight times as many as in 1992 . <p> Before newborn alpacas can be registered , their pedigreed lineage must be confirmed by blood typing . Imported alpacas are screened for physical characteristics , health and fiber quality . The registry accepted 650 animals for registration in 1997 , rejecting 170 . As of July 1 of this year , 1,016 animals had been registered . <p> At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported alpacas , mainly because some owners worry that an increase in supply will erode the value of their herds . The decision was taken by the 1,600 alpaca owners who are members of the registry . <p> But more than a fourth of the association members who took part in the vote opposed the move , arguing that some alpaca strains were not yet numerous enough in the United States to provide adequate gene pools for good selective breeding . <p> Roberta Guidry , a member of the registry 's board of directors , predicted that importers would continue to bring in alpacas , even if they were not permitted to register them . <p> " The importers have said to us there is no way they 're going to stop , " she said , and some breeders are concerned that a rival registry might be created for animals imported after this year . Ms. Guidry estimated that 98 percent of all alpacas in the United States are registered . <p> A similar registry for llamas , which are popular as pack animals throughout the Rocky Mountains , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's llama herd , now estimated to be about 200,000 head , is registered . <p> As the llama population in the United States has grown , prices have fallen , although a top-quality breeding llama might still be worth several thousand dollars . <p> Alpaca industry officials say careful breeding practices , registration and the animals ' relative scarcity have helped keep alpaca prices up . But many owners say that it is the high quality of alpaca wool that will preserve the animals ' commercial value after their novelty wears off . <p> " That 's what we 're breeding toward , to get that fine fiber and to be able to market fine garments from that , " said Gordon A. Anderson , president of the alpaca breeders association . He said increasing numbers of alpaca owners operate stores to sell products made of alpaca wool . <p> Mr. Anderson and his wife , Carolyn , have 17 alpacas on their ranch in Mossyrock , Wash. , in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains south of Seattle and weave the animals ' wool into designer rugs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including rugs and livestock , and had been profitable since 1996 . Alpaca enthusiasts say the fiber is stronger , lighter , warmer and softer than wool . " And it 's possible to make an absolutely beautiful garment just using natural colors , " said Rachel Hendrickson , chairwoman of the alpaca association 's fiber committee . She said American fashion houses were beginning to take an interest in alpaca . <p> The American alpaca industry can not yet produce enough fiber to supply a major garment maker . But a step in that direction was the formation of the Alpaca Fiber Cooperative of North America , which was incorporated in January and has 400 members . The cooperative is currently collecting fleece from its members and preparing to ship it this fall to a mill in Peru . <p> " There are really no mills of any size in the United States that can process alpaca fiber from A to Z , " said Russell J. Grattan , president of the cooperative . " The mill we 're working with in Peru has been processing alpaca fiber for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 20,000 pounds of fiber , then bring it back as yarn and finished products like blankets , scarves and rugs . Some of the goods will be returned to members , and the rest will be marketed by the cooperative , Mr. Grattan said . <p> The biggest alpaca ranch in the United States , the 100-acre Alpacas of America in Arlington , Wash. , has a herd that fluctuates between 900 and 1,300 head . It has sold more than 500 animals so far this year , at $12,500 to around $50,000 a head , Randal P. Snow , the ranch 's business manager , said . <p> " It 's incredibly profitable , " Mr. Snow said , though he declined to reveal earnings figures . <p> Small-scale breeders can also make good money , Mr. Snow said . And that is what Tony and Mindy Simon and Vivian Goldstein , Ms. Simon 's mother , are aiming to do with a 19-head alpaca herd they have built up on a ranch near Longmont , Colo . They now have three pregnant females and two recently weaned females @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Those sales would pay off the family 's investment in alpacas , Ms. Simon said . " So starting next year would be pretty much pure profit , " she added . <p> Ms. Simons , 30 , first encountered alpacas in 1994 at a wool market in Estes Park . " I went in the alpaca stand and fell in love with the alpacas , " she said . The Simons and Ms. Goldstein bought their first four animals in 1994 and their ranch in 1996 . Last spring , Ms. Simon quit her computer programming job in nearby Boulder to devote full time to the alpaca business . <p> Mr. Simon , 32 , who is also a programmer , said he hoped that the alpaca business would become profitable enough that he too could leave his job at I.B.M . in Boulder to spend full time on the ranch . <p> " I 'd rather be here than at work  --  it 's a labor of love , " he said . " I would do it in a heartbeat . " <p> Chart : " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric , alpaca fleece can be very lucrative to sell . The chart shows the Number of Alpacas in the Alpaca Registry since 1992 .
