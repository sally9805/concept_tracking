<p> Just after their divorce , Al Rodenburg and his ex-wife had to sell their Woodbridge town house fast . <p> They paid $ 36,000 cash for the privilege . <p> " There are no guarantees in life , but nobody enters into that type of arrangement expecting to lose so much money , " said Rodenburg , a contract specialist who bought the house originally for $ 170,000 and sold it at a painful loss . " Things are just so overbuilt out here . There 's been no foresight and no planning , and too many people have lost money . " <p> There 's trouble in some of the fastest-growing suburbs of Virginia and Maryland , where budget-priced new houses are driving down the selling prices of similar houses built just a few years ago . Many owners , often young people , moved to the suburban fringe so they could afford their first house . Now they find they must either stay put or throw away tens of thousands of dollars to get out . <p> The phenomenon is playing a key role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several counties have enacted or are considering drastic residential development limits aimed in part at raising property values in many neighborhoods . <p> It also underscores a new reality for housing in Washington and throughout much of the country : The era of big returns is gone , at least for now . <p> " It used to be you could make 10 or 15 percent a year on your house , almost guaranteed . It was better than stocks , " said Tom Quattlebaum , executive vice president of the Anne Arundel Association of Realtors . " Now you 'll be lucky to get your money back . . . . Housing has changed back from being an investment to being shelter . " <p> Overall , the Washington residential market has been lackluster , with prices lagging behind inflation since 1992 . The news has improved recently in some areas : Sales volume has jumped markedly in the District , Alexandria and Arlington County , and Northern Virginia reported a 5 percent increase in median sales prices last year  --  twice the average for the Washington area as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs , sellers still are struggling to break even . <p> Prince William County posted the biggest losses in both sales and prices in 1996 , with the median price dropping 8.4 percent to $ 138,000 , according to Experian , a real estate information service . Prices also fell that year in Anne Arundel and Loudoun counties while remaining flat in Howard County . Precise figures are n't yet available for 1997 , but real estate agents say most of those areas again showed little price growth . <p> Prince George 's County , which like Prince William is a hotbed of starter homes , also has been in the doldrums when it comes to price . The average sales price remained at about $ 139,000 in 1997 , according to the Prince George 's Association of Realtors . <p> Values in many of those areas still have not rebounded fully from the market slump of the early 1990s , analysts said , which followed a housing boom in the 1980s . Steady construction and fierce competition among home builders have helped hold down prices in the Washington area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country . <p> The problem is most evident in neighborhoods overrun with inexpensive town houses and condominiums , for which assessed values have remained stagnant or even dropped in recent years . In some areas of Prince William , units that sold for $ 130,000 or more less than a decade ago are now commonly let go for $ 90,000 or less . <p> Air Force Capt . Jim Gates and his wife , Gretchen , bought their three-bedroom town house four years ago in the Promontory Oaks section of Lake Ridge , nervously signing their first mortgage of $ 130,000 . With identical neighboring units now selling for $ 10,000 less than that , Gates  --  who faces a mandatory transfer this summer  --  has decided to rent out the town house rather than sell it at a loss . <p> " A lot of the houses around here are rentals now , " said Gates , 33 , who has two young children . " Most of the people who originally bought them have moved away , and they rent them out because they ca n't afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a little loss each year than one big hit all at once . " <p> For angry homeowners , there are many things to blame . Some complain that real estate agents overstate the potential return on their investment . Others concede that they paid too much during the boom years . <p> But many reserve their scorn for home builders and politicians , who they say have let rapid development eat away at their investments . <p> Counties such as Prince William and Loudoun continue to grow at the rate of one new house every three hours , and builders are pushing aggressive discounts and money-back deals to sell them  --  undercutting the value of property nearby . As a result , " upside-down sales , " where the seller must bring money to the closing , continue to be common in outlying suburbs and Prince George 's , according to analysts and real estate agents . <p> In Howard County , Ilene Kessler , of Coldwell Banker Grampler , said about one-third of her transactions require sellers to bring money to the table . She said many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the market in the 1980s find themselves losing money when forced to move by transfers or federal cutbacks . <p> John Tuccillo , a consulting economist with the National Association of Realtors , said the problem has been the result of too many new houses and too little demand . He said residential construction is driven more by the availability of easy credit for builders than by buyers ' demand . <p> " Washington , D.C. , right now has one of the worst , most overbuilt real estate markets in the country , " Tuccillo said . " The home-building market is strong , but demand is relatively weak . . . . In other places , the two forces are more in balance . " <p> That glut of low-end housing provides relatively little tax revenue to pay for new schools and other services required by new residents , contributing , in turn , to crowded classrooms and high taxes . The dilemma has been a key point in debates over whether to sharply limit new development . <p> In Prince William , recent community meetings have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who say unfettered development has driven down sale prices and caused high tax rates . The county is weighing proposals to drastically cut the number of homes  --  particularly smaller town houses  --  that could be built during the next 20 years . <p> In Loudoun , supervisors slashed by 70,000 the number of units that can be built in the Dulles South area . And Prince George 's has imposed a moratorium on development in areas where schools have too many students . <p> Stewart Schwartz , executive director of the Coalition for Smarter Growth , said he constantly hears complaints from those in the outer suburbs about depressed housing prices . He said many parents , already angry about high taxes and crowded schools , discover that they ca n't afford to sell their house and move . <p> " They feel like they 're taking it both ways , " said Schwartz , whose organization lobbies for growth limits and development impact fees . " They get high taxes and low property values , all to subsidize new development . . . . When you subsidize anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's happening here . " <p> Builders and developers object to that line of argument . They say many homeowners are the unfortunate victims of the local housing market , which still has n't recovered from the recession of the early 1990s . In addition , some say , many people have overextended themselves by borrowing heavily against their equity or declining to make large down payments . <p> " The marketplace is making an adjustment from a supply and demand point of view , " said Roy Beckner , Prince William representative for the Northern Virginia Building Industry Association . " Unfortunately , we get peaks and valleys , and some people right now are in the valley . " <p> Many also believe the region is heading for a real estate recovery , particularly given mortgage rates of 7 percent or less . In Loudoun , where the market for town houses and condominiums is still in the dumps , the sale of high-value detached houses appears to have taken off in recent months : Sales in December were more than double the number tallied in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolation to homeowners such as Linda Lilly , who can see rows of new houses from the custom-built deck of her 11-year-old home in Woodbridge . The models are priced at or below what she and her husband paid in 1990 , and the couple are n't sure they can afford to move . <p> " Unless we want to walk away giving money away , we ca n't do it , " said Lilly , 37 , whose husband has two children from a previous marriage . " What it 's done for us is make us very angry at the county . It 's not what we 're used to , and it 's not what we expected . . . . They should have some responsibility for protecting us as much as they protect the developers . "
