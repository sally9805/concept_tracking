<p> WITH BOLD HUES and silhouettes that hint at their subtropical origins , dahlias bring drama to any environment . Indeed , their exotic beauty reflects their history in cultivation , which began when the ancient Aztecs carefully selected and grew the Central and South American native cocoxochit/for medicinal uses and probably also for food , forage , and ornament . The plants were introduced to Europe via Madrid in the late 1700s and were quickly hybridized and popularized . By the 1830s nearly 100 varieties were available , and the enthusiasm for dahlias was approaching the intensity , of tulipomania . Prices for tubers ( the fleshy roots from which stems , leaves , and flowers arise ) of showy cultivars rose wildly until the market was saturated and gardeners , from royals to commoners , settled down to enjoy their deafly bought blossoms . <p> Given their history and character , it 's easy to see dahlias as lead players  --  especially in the cutting garden . These hearty growers dependably produce a bonanza of blossoms from midsummer to the first hard frost . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genus is also famous for its versatility . There 's a dahlia color , size , and flower type for any garden or floral design . Blossoms come in every imaginable shade , excluding blue and black , and forms range from disarming , daisylike singles and drumsticklike pompons to pointy-petaled cactus types and sensuously scalloped waterlilies . Flower size can be as small as one-inch miniatures or as gargantuan as " dinner-plate " dahlias over a foot wide , while plants range from six-inch dwarfs to trees over ten feet . The foliage can be attractive , too , in colors from light through deep forest green to dark purple . Care and cultivation <p> Since the Aztecs ' days , dahlias have been bred to be gardener friendly . They like sun ( light shade in hot-summer regions ) , a steady supply of moisture , and good food in copious quantities . Because dahlias are extremely sensitive to frost , planting time should be no earlier than two weeks before your region 's last frost date ; growth will be most rapid after soil temperature has reached 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and evenly moist but well-drained . Make sure the site has good air circulation and is protected from stiff winds . Enrich lean soils with compost or aged  --  not fresh  --  manure and bone meal . Add lime to overly sour soils or peat moss to overly alkaline ones to achieve an optimal pH of 6.5 to 7 . ( For a jump start on spring , tubers can be potted six weeks prior to final frost , and kept slightly moist in a sunny , warm spot for sprouting . Transplant outdoors once the soil has warmed . ) <p> Spread out the multifingered tubers , crown up , in a spokelike fashion in the planting hole . ( The " eyes " will tell you which side is up . ) The eyes should rest two to three inches below soil level , though a little more depth is beneficial in especially light or sandy soils . Handle the tubers carefully to avoid breaking the thin necks . Space plantings 18 inches to three feet apart , depending on the cultivar size . Plants that grow taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Before covering the tubers , firmly situate a support stake ( tall sections of bamboo or builders ' reinforcement bar work well ) between the tuber fingers about two inches from the crown . Tamp the soil over the tubers , water in , and label . As the plant grows , tie the stems to the stake at intervals with strips of nylon stocking . <p> In placing dahlias , be mindful that their blossoms , like their composite cousins the sunflowers , tend to face the sun . Blooms will usually be showiest seen from the south , planted on the north side of an east-west path . <p> The fewer stems produced by a single planting , the larger and more plentiful the flowers . For cuts , it 's best to allow no more than four to eight stems per clump ( some purists allow only one ) ; pinch off the others as they emerge . ( Note that some tips for cut flower gardeners differ from those geared for general gardeners or exhibition growers . For a broad picture , see Philip Damp 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800-247-8154 . ) After the selected stems have two pairs of well-developed leaves , pinch out the uppermost growing tip to promote bushiness . After pinching , mulch to conserve soil moisture . Later , as the first buds begin to color , you may wish to routinely pinch out the two side buds of the three that develop at each leaf axil this selective disbudding will result in larger flowers with longer stems . Be sure to deadhead spent blossoms . <p> Dahlias have hearty appetites and feed near the soil 's surface . For optimal bloom production , top-dress plants with a slow-release , low-nitrogen , high-phosphate food ( or aged manure ) once just after your initial stem thinning , a second time when buds begin to set , and then again one month later . Do not feed for four weeks prior to frost , since lean tubers are less apt to decay during winter storage . Slowly soak growing plants at least once a week during dry weather . ( Drip irrigation is preferable to overhead watering , which can lead to disfigured blossoms and powdery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-stressed  --  flower production will slow down or cease , and is almost impossible to get going again . <p> As shoots emerge , keep a wary eye out for slugs , snails , earwigs , and cutworms . Aphids , powdery , mildew ( especially during cool , wet periods ) , spider mites , leaf spot , and Japanese beetles may also threaten , but are less apt to plague a well-sighted , healthy plant . Late in the season , protect still-blooming plants ( if they 're compact enough ) from untimely frosts with upturned cardboard boxes or plastic pots . <p> Dahlias must be dug and stored in cold-winter regions , unless you choose to treat the tubers as annuals and start with fresh purchases each spring . ( In USDA Zones 10 and 11 , dahlias can be left in the ground two years or more before crowding necessitates division . ) After the first frost blackens the foliage , cut the main stalk down to within a few inches of the soil , through a solid leaf node , and allow the tubers one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dig the clump immediately . Once you have unearthed the tubers , wash off the soil , then allow them to dry upside down in a frost-free , airy spot . <p> Divide large clumps with a sharp knife by slicing through the main stalk stump , then down and between healthy tubers . Each division should have at least one eye . Remove all damaged , shriveled , or decaying tubers and hairlike feeder roots . Dust each new division lightly with powdered sulfur or a 50/50 mix of powdered sulfur and lime . <p> Store dahlias in slightly moistened vermiculite or seed mix in plastic bags ( punctured here and there for ventilation ) or heavy cardboard boxes . ( To moisten the medium , spread it in a thin layer over wet newspaper , sprinkle lightly , then cover with several sheets of wet newspaper and let sit overnight . ) Tuber clumps should not touch one another during storage . Keep the containers in a dry , cool ( 35 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit ) , well-ventilated garage or basement . Check the tubers once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any discolored sections and mist the storage medium if shriveling is evident . Recommended varieties <p> The cultivars listed below have proved to be excellent cut flowers ; many are dassics that have won awards from the American Dahlia Society . The society recognizes 17 different dahlia classes based primarily on flower form ; the most important categories are included here . <p> Anemone : Flowers have one or more rows of petals ( technically ray florets ) surrounding a dense group of upright , tubular florets . Plant height is often two to three feet . Good choices include dark red ' Azuma Kagami ' , pink-and-yellow ' Honey ' , and bronze ' Scarabella ' . <p> Ball : A ball-shaped flower , sometimes with a slightly flattened top , with ray florets cupped more than half their length . Heights vary . Among the best are bronze ' Crichton Honey ' , purple ' Downham Royal ' , white ' L'Ancresse ' , and yellow ' Nettie ' . <p> Cactus-flowered : A fully double flower with long , pointed , quill-like ray florets and no central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , apricot-and-pink ' Mary Jo ' , white-and-velvety-purple ' Match ' , and cyclamen-purple ' Purple Gem ' . <p> Collarette : Blossoms have an open , yellow center surrounded by an inner , ruffly collar of short florets ( collarettes ) and one or two rings of typically flat ray florets . Height is often around four feet . Try purple ' Little Showoff and lavender ' Rosy Wings ' . <p> Decorative : A fully double blossom with no visible central disk . Plants are often three to five feet tall . Among the best are dark red ' Arabian Night ' , orange ' Hamilton Lillian ' , and purple-and-white ' Purple Royalty ' . <p> Orchid-flowered : Blossoms are similar to the single varieties , but have ray fioret edges rolled under most of their length . Heights vary . Yellow ' Honka ' , red ' Marie Schnugg ' , and dark red ' Wine Frost ' are all good choices . <p> Peony-flowered : Blossoms have two or more rows of broad , flat ray florets and an open center sometimes encircled by small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best are red ' Japanese Bishop ' , pink ' Powder Gull ' , and **25;296;TOOLONG ' Tinker Bell ' . <p> Pompon : A miniature , drumstick blossom with ray floret edges rolled inward their entire length . Plants are often three to four feet tall . Top picks include black-red ' Crossfield Ebony ' , white-and-purple ' Don 's Delight ' , purple ' Glenplace ' , lavender ' Mark Lockwood ' , and ' Yellow Baby ' . <p> Single : A daisylike blossom with an open center ( or disk ) surrounded by one or two rows of ray florets . Many grow only about 12 inches tall . Look for red ' Alta Bishop ' , purple-and-white ' First Love ' , dark red ' Rembrandt ' , and lavender-and-purple ' Veronica ' . <p> Waterlily : A fully double , flat , shallow flower with broad ray florets . Plants are often three to four feet tall . Outstanding cultivars include yellow ' Cameo ' , pink ' Figurine ' , pink ' Gerrie Hoek ' , white-and-lavender-pink ' Nepos ' , and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small arrangements can be cut from dwarf bedding dahlias grown from seed or purchased in six packs along with annuals at most garden centers . These are excellent for a massed bedding effect in the front border , pot culture , and patio plantings , since the short bushy plants ( not over 36 inches and often well under that height ) require no pinching . They show the same flower form and color diversity as their taller siblings . Look for the cultivars ' Collarette Dandy ' , with collarette blossoms in mixed colors on plants up to 24 inches ; ' Figaro ' , with mixed-color flowers on 12-inch plants ; ' Mignon Silver ' , with pure white blossoms on 20-inch plants ; and ' Redskin ' , up to 15 inches in mixed colors , with maroon to bronzy-green foliage . <p> Even gardeners who steer clear of plants that require winter storage should consider making an exception for dahlias few other plants offer such a bevy of cut flowers at so little cost .

For optimal vase life : <p> *Bring sharp secateurs and a bucket of clean , warm water to the garden in the early morning or late evening . Choose blossoms three-quarters to fully open with firm yet well-developed centers . Cut just above the nearest leaf node and set of side buds that will give you the stem length you need . ( Do n't be squeamish about cutting long stems or having to harvest a few immature buds with your prize cut . There will be more flowers . The side buds you leave behind will develop quickly . ) Sink stem ends in water , recut them immediately at an angle underwater , and leave them in the bucket to rest as you continue to harvest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will leave a short , hollow stump just above a solid node . To prevent water from collecting and possibly causing decay there , use your scissors ' tip ( or an ice pick ) to pierce a small drainage hole just above the leaf node below your cut . ( Experiment with your second-best cultivars . This excavation may not be required for plant health in your region . ) Indoors prepare a very warm ( 130 degree Fahrenheit ) preservative solution , preferably with distilled water . Remove all foliage that would otherwise rest underwater . At this point , some experts choose to sear stem ends for 30 seconds over a candle flame to stem sap flow . Experiment . This step may or may not add appreciably to the vase life of your cultivars . Sink stem ends in the preservative solution and allow the blossoms a long drink ( eight hours to overnight ) in a cool , dark place before using . Display dahlias in niches away from sun , drafts , and ethylene sources such as motor exhaust or ripening fruit . Mist frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dark , cool spot when not on display . Cut dahlias are thirsty . Check preservative solution levels daily and top up when necessary . Recut stem ends and change preservative solution every three days . To dry dahlias , harvest dewless , fully open blossoms in the early afternoon . Remove all foliage . Nestle the cuts horizontally into a one- or two-inch bed of silica gel ( available at craft stores ) in a shallow box , then cover with at least an inch of the medium . Leave buried until dry . Warmth will hasten the process . Drying time varies widely depending on flower size . <p>
