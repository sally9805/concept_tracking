Section : INVESTING You can be clean and green by investing in ecology , peace and social harmony and still ... <p> BY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS , AMERICANS ARE REFUSING TO COMPROMISE their social and political principles in the quest for investment profits . As a result , so-called socially responsible investing  --  in other words , clean and green investing  --  is today 's fastest-growing money-management style . The pros who invest in companies that , for example , seek to improve the environment or workers ' welfare , and shun firms in the tobacco or nuclear-power industries , now manage $625 billion , up from $500 billion last year and a mere $100 billion in 1985 . ( For 50 top socially responsible investments , see the table on page 133 . ) <p> Moreover , converts to the clean and green trend are discovering that , contrary to what they have heard from Wall Street types in the past , they can invest for the common good and still beat the average common stocks . That old truism  --  that people who restrict their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving up at least a percentage point or two of annual profits  --  ai n't necessarily so . Consider the evidence : <p> Of the five ethical mutual funds in existence since 1986 , four beat the average returns for their respective fund categories for the five years through 1990 by four to 13 percentage points . The clear winner : Pax World , which topped the average balanced fund , 71.1% to 57.4% , and was the only fund to get an A rating for risk-adjusted return in MONEY 'S rankings . <p> In 1990 , when four out of five equity funds in MONEY 'S rankings posted losses , Pax World was up 10.5% . Two of the other six socially conscious stock funds made money as well : Dreyfus Third Century , up 3.6% , and Calvert Social Investment Managed Growth , up 1.8% . <p> And the Domini Social Index , a benchmark of 400 ethical stocks that was created in April 1990 by Kinder Lydenberg Domini , a leading socially conscious investment advisory firm in Cambridge , Mass. , gained 19% for the 12 months to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 . <p> It 's little wonder the word is spreading that you do n't have to sacrifice your principal to your principles  --  and that more small investors are welcoming the news . Take Barbara and Russ Widstrand , who own a photography studio in Los Angeles . After long donating money to environmental groups and recycling their trash , they decided to let their consciences guide their investments as well . " What 's the use of donating money to save the whales when your IRA is invested in a company that is killing them ? " asks Barbara , 34 . So in late 1988 , she and Russ , 32 , began moving their $40,000 portfolio to the Calvert Group of mutual funds , which invest only in companies that the funds ' managers deem to be environmentally responsible . And the Widstrands have been rewarded . Since they made the switch , they have earned a solid 10.6% to 11 .. 5% on their conservative bond and balanced funds . Moreover , the $4,000 they put in Calvert 's aggressive small-company Ariel Appreciation fund has gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a profit-making opportunity , Wall Street is going green too . Today there are 17 socially conscious mutual funds and other ethical investment products  --  among them the top-performing Eco-Logical unit investment trust  --  up from six in 1985 . In addition , at least eight large brokerages , including Shearson Lehman , Prudential Securities and Smith Barney , now offer research or money-management services that are especially geared to socially responsible investors . <p> Such ethical investing also has spread far beyond the hard core of environmental and political activists . Prodded by demands from the public that they green their portfolios , pension funds now provide more than $500 billion , or 80% , of the money invested according to some sort of socially conscious criteria . For example , TIAA-CREF , the teachers ' retirement fund with assets of $90 billion , is pressuring companies it owns to stop doing business in South Africa , as is the New York City pension system , with $45 billion in assets . <p> Despite the growing evidence that socially conscious investing can be profitable , most professionals are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , 20 years or more . These pros dismiss the ethical funds ' one , or even five , years of solid performance as largely a fluke . " I do n't believe that by restricting your investment universe you can increase your returns  --  that does n't make sense , " says Chris Niemczewski , president of Marshfield Associates , a money-management firm in Washington , D.C. <p> Adherents of socially conscious investing counter by noting that most practitioners use such broad criteria in picking stocks that some 70% of the 1,000 largest U.S. companies qualify . " Since typical small investors own at most 25 stocks , " says Bruce Lehmann , an associate professor of economics and finance at Columbia University 's business school , " limiting the universe to a modest extent wo n't have much impact on returns . " <p> Most mainstream clean and green investors start by steering clear of alcohol and gambling stocks , as well as corporations that do business in South Africa , make armaments , produce nuclear power or pollute . Next , the investors subject the remaining stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot promising buys . Finally , they screen the survivors to identify the ones that meet more detailed social criteria . <p> The thinking behind this approach is that doing good pays off . " Socially responsible management is simply good management , " says Patrick McVeigh , research director for Franklin Research &; Development , a Boston ethical-investing firm . Companies that ignore the environment , say , risk becoming targets of liability suits . Those that follow insensitive personnel policies may have growing difficulty retaining first-rate workers . And firms that consciously contribute to the community can build good will with customers and increase sales . <p> " By looking at social criteria , we can spot healthy companies and screen out those with problems , " says Eric McKissack , senior vice president at Ariel Capital , which manages the Calvert-Ariel Growth Fund . The approach has certainly paid off for the fund , which ranks in the top 10% of all small-company growth funds since its inception in November 1986 , according to Lipper Analytical Services . Further , the firm 's more recent fund , Calvert-Ariel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds for the 12-month period that ended March 31 , according to CDA Technologies . <p> Keep in mind , however , that these funds , like all the ethical leaders , are managed according to broad criteria . Other clean-and-green-minded investors follow far stricter rules . For example , some invest solely in companies with at least two women among their directors  --  a test passed by just 74 of the firms in the S &P; 500 . And others who favor stringent bans on animal testing avoid all drug companies and nearly all consumer-products companies . Such inflexibility makes diversification nearly impossible and thereby increases your risk . <p> There is yet another complication : even adherents who follow liberal criteria often disagree on a company 's ethical rating . Consider the debate over Amoco , a $28.5 billion natural gas producer and an industry leader in alternative energy research . The company 's white hat turned black in 1978 after its tanker Amoco Cadiz spilled 68 million gallons of oil off Brittany . When Calvert fund managers asked investors whether Amoco was still an acceptable stock , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who consider socially conscious criteria continue to hold Amoco shares . <p> As with most investing , the clean and green approach requires careful analysis of a firm 's finances as well as its record on social and environmental issues , using data collected from government agencies , private watchdog groups and the company itself . Because such research is too difficult for most individuals , small investors are probably best off sticking with solid , socially conscious mutual funds such as the nine listed in the table on page 133 . Check a fund 's prospectus , however , to be sure that the manager 's goals match your own . Dreyfus Third Century , for example , buys certain defense stocks , whereas Pax World will not hold any . <p> If you want to invest in individual stocks , you will probably need guidance from a money manager or newsletter that . is in harmony with your social criteria . For a directory of such experts , send $35 to the Social Investment Forum , 430 First Ave . North , Suite 290 , Minneapolis , Minn. 55401 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fear not . As long as you do n't overdo a good thing , you can invest according to your canons of social responsibility and pick winning stocks and mutual funds . Says Timothy Smith , executive director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility , which advises money managers for church and religious organizations : " If companies pay attention to the social bottom line , it will help them remain profit leaders . " That could be true for small investors as well . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> BY PENELOPE WANG <p> THE 50 BEST CLEAN AND GREEN INVESTMENTS <p> To put together this list of ethical investments , we asked Franklin Research &; Development , which publishes Investing for a Better World ( monthly , $19.95 a year ; 617-423-6655 ) , to identify the 50 most promising stocks , mutual funds and cash investments that meet widely accepted social-investing criteria . <p> Franklin first excluded all companies connected with alcohol , animal testing , gambling , nuclear power , South Africa , tobacco and weapons manufacturing . After that , Franklin ranked the shares of 1,000 companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest rating and 5 as the lowest , the firms that qualified scored 2.5 or better in each category . Thirty stocks with solid investing fundamentals are listed in the table , starting with those that had the best overall ratings . <p> Companies with an environmental rating of 1 were outstanding in pollution control , hazardous-waste reduction and energy conservation . <p> Firms that earned a 1 rating for employee relations excelled in at least three of the following areas : promotion of women and minorities , action on child care and AIDS , fringe benefits , commitment to on-the-job safety , and fair bargaining with unions . <p> Franklin based corporate citizenship ratings on community involvement and charitable giving , such as funding low-income housing , scholarships and job-training programs . Again , the 1-rated companies were among the best in three areas . <p> We then measured the survivors against investment criteria , excluding blue chips selling far above the average market P/E of 17 , and we required at least a B + financial rating from Value Line Investment Survey . <p> In considering smaller growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as plastics recycling . Because small stocks are volatile , only aggressive investors should consider them . <p> The 10 utilities on the list offer total returns of 10% a year or higher , based on current yield and projected earnings growth rates for the next five years . They also have Value Line safety ratings of B + or better . <p> For mutual fund investors the choices are limited , since only about a dozen funds follow ethical investing principles ; nine are currently open and tracked by Franklin . They are listed in order of their total return for the past year . <p> Among cash investments , we include those offered by banks that lend locally for socially conscious projects . These banks are all federally insured and accept out-of-state deposits . The money-market funds on the list hold only the securities of corporations that meet broad social screening tests .
