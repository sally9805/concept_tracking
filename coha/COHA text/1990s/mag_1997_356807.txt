Behind every great fortune , " Balzac wrote , " there is a crime . " That 's the contention of the stunning lawsuit filed last week by Digital Equipment Corp . against microchip giant Intel . The great fortune in this case comes courtesy of the Pentium microprocessing chip , which runs 85% of the earth 's personal computers and helped feed Intel $6.45 billion in revenues in the first quarter of 1997 alone . The alleged crime is Intel 's " willful infringement " on 10 Dig-ital patents in building the Pentium series . And the suggested punishment : damages that could run into the billions and an injunction against continued use of Digital technology . <P> Digital 's surprise assault was impeccably timed : the previous week Intel had celebrated the launch of next-generation chip Pentium II . And the day of Digital 's suit , microprocessor upstart Cyrix quietly filed its own patent-infringement claim against Intel . Digital followed a day later with full-page ads in the Wall Street Journal , New York Times and San Jose Mercury News . Wall Street took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and backslapping Digital up $2 in the belief that the microchip David would n't rile Goliath unless it had a really , really good case . <P> But by week 's end analysts were asking whether the Digital action was an honest plea for justice or just the bared-fang attack of a cornered and wounded animal . The tottering hardware giant had bet heavily on its $2.5 billion Alpha microprocessor to return it to prosperity . Alpha is unquestionably the fastest chip on the market , but its speed has n't overcome Intel 's marketing clout . In 1996 , according to Scottsdale , Ariz. - based Mercury Research , Intel shipped some 65 million Pentium chips , or 76% of the microprocessor market , compared with 200,000 Alphas . And this year looks grimmer still : 18 million Pentiums shipped through March , to 60,000 Alphas . <P> Two months ago , rival Hewlett-Packard allied with Microsoft to push the software giant 's Windows NT program into corporate servers , the machines that link large computer networks . In 1995 Digital had cut its own Microsoft deal , looking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is losing ground in a market already dominated by Intel , rather than Digital , chips . <P> With the ramparts collapsing around him , Digital CEO Robert Palmer must have seen little choice but all-out attack . The lawsuit claims Intel infringed on 10 Digital patents related to Alpha and other chips  --  though Palmer does n't claim this piracy occurred during negotiations between the companies in 1990 and ' 91 . Intel was then considering licensing Alpha technology for its next-generation chip ; after both companies signed a confidentiality agreement , Dig- gital revealed the Alpha design . But the talks fell apart , and Pentium , sans Alpha , went on to become the soul of the new PC . <P> By 1995 Palmer was noticing reviews of Intel 's new Pentium Pro line that found it strikingly  --  even suspiciously  --  improved over its Pentium forebears . Intel itself provided the most damning hints that it had leaned on its competitors for the upgrade . " There 's nothing left to copy , " said chief operating officer Craig Barrett in an incendiary Wall Street Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banana now , " noted CEO Andrew Grove . " We ca n't rely on others to do our research and development for us. "
