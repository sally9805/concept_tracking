<p> Here we are at the end of summer looking for that perfect trashy novel to take to the beach , and guess what 's happened : There 's been a delectable shift in publishing energy since our last foray in the garbage bins ! The chronology seems to go like this : <p> Ten years ago you could have driven a truck through the high- school-gym of commercial fiction and not hit a single author  --  all the romance novelists ( women ) were on one side and all the military techno-thriller writers ( men ) were on the other . <p> Then came the emergence of Gal Detective writers ( Sue Grafton , Patricia Cornwell ) whose sales soared through the roof as they began to compete with Guy Detective writers ( Elmore Leonard , Robert Parker ) for much the same audience . <p> Or did they ? Suddenly , it seemed , book publishers woke up to the fact that 1 ) many more women than men buy commercial fiction , and 2 ) women like to read about strong women characters ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , the New York Times claimed that publishers were rejecting manuscripts with traditional male heroes and instructing authors to create female heroes , or at least strong female characters . <p> So here comes the late-summer trashy batch , and we readers want to know : Is there a preponderance of female protagonists in commercial fiction , and if so , what does it mean ? Let 's dig in : <p> At first glance , you might suspect the ditzy title and autopsy- bent female hero of DEJA DEAD ( Scribner ; 411 pages ; $ 24 ) by Kathy Reichs to be imitations of Patricia Cornwell 's novels featuring medical examiner Kay Scarpetta . But here the doctor is Temperance Brennan , not a coroner in Virginia but a forensic anthropologist in Montreal who 's called in when " the corpse was largely skeletonized , the little soft tissue that remained far too decomposed for standard autopsy . " <p> It 's mesmerizing to watch as Temperance slices , measures and weighs muscle- turned-to-leather and bones made corky from a kind of anthropologist 's marinade while maggots abandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the table , from the table to the floor , in a slow but steady drizzle . Pale yellow grains of rice lay writhing by my feet . I avoided stepping on them . I 'd never really gotten used to them . " <p> Less paranoid and infinitely more chatty than Kay Scarpetta , Temperance is a recovering alcoholic and single mother of an independent-minded daughter ( " Bones were easier to read than kids , " she sighs ) , and at times a bit too glib about the bodies she 's autopsying : " As I separated the damp strands ( of hair ) , " I could n't help imagining the last time the victim had combed it , wondering if she 'd been pleased , frustrated , indifferent . Good hair day . Bad hair day . Dead hair day . " <p> Still , when Temperance observes the kind of " sadistic cruelty and mutilation " that victims on her autopsy table must have endured , we can rely on her clinical detachment and female concern ( the victims are women ) to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leave of absence from the University of North Carolina to work for the Quebec Provincial Police , Temperance also finds tyrannical homicide investigator Luc Claudel frequently infuriating . He reminds her of the male-dominated field she has chosen by cracking a joke among colleagues in her presence that elicits " the throaty sound men seem to share when enjoying a joke at the expense of women . " <p> The dismembered body that Temperance discovers in the first pages predictably becomes one in a number of connected slayings that show evidence of a vicious serial killer at work . But the grisly mystery that she must tackle  --  and the guttings of women are certainly repulsive  --  is never conveyed with the kind of relish or blood lust that Lorenzo Carcaterra ( " Sleepers " ) demonstrates in APACHES ( Ballantine ; 336 pages ; $ 25 ) . <p> It 's horrible to watch a criminal named Malcolm rape and brutalize Jennifer Santori , " running lit matches down the sides of her thighs and across her breasts during restful moments , " forcing liquor down her throat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off her finger and slices the skin across her shoulders , then punches her " hard , heavy and often , smashing bone and breaking skin " so that " ' there was n't a part of Jennifer 's body that was n't bruised , bleeding or broken , " it 's almost impossible to continue reading  --  especially since Jennifer is only 12 years old . <p> This is a perfect setup for the author to unleash the righteous fury of the hero , Boomer Frontieri , a former New York detective who once " viewed his job under a bright , unmistakable moral light . " Though nearly killed many times , " the truth be known , he enjoyed his dance with death . And that made him the deadliest cop to have on the street . " Thus is the tradition of detective-as-savior sustained , until a last bullet forces Boomer into retirement . <p> When , however , Jennifer 's father tearfully begs Boomer to find the girl , Boomer and his former partner Dead-Eye investigate the horrid underworld of New York and uncover an even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hollowed out so that drugs can be hidden inside ; women ( " all neat and clean . No record , no arrests , no history of drug usage " ) hired to act like mothers carrying their " sleeping " babies on airplanes without detection , and thousands of lives snuffed out before the seventh month . <p> We 're supposed to be dazzled by the renegade unit formed by Boomer and NYPD **25;178;TOOLONG ( bombs , wiretaps , drugs , homicide , undercover ) to go after the bad guys . But soon enough we find ourselves asking what kind of mind thought this stuff up ? Does anybody , male or female , enjoy this sort of " entertainment " anymore ? Or has violence and sexual brutality so escalated in traditional thriller fiction that tough-guy heroes who " let fists and fear " do their talking in the name of Good are no better than villains who represent the worst kind of Evil ? <p> One could say that Carcaterra has gone overboard , but ghoulish elements have sneaked into such fiction for so long that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi-raised Amerasian doctor Nguyen- Anh Dupree ca n't redeem the unnecessarily gruesome POSITIVE MATCH by Tony Chiu ( Bantam ; 407 pages ; $ 22.95 ) <p> The opening pages sound informative and intriguing as Mexican " illegals " attempt to cross the U.S. border the modern way , using infrared binoculars , electronic compasses and computers that hack their way into the border patrol 's data banks . Of course the border police have equally sophisticated arsenals to combat such maneuvers , but that 's not enough of a story for Chiu . <p> Instead he introduces a third group whose members cruelly trap , chloroform and haul the Mexicans into a refrigerated van where their internal organs are " harvested " and sold around the world for transplant operations . Well , shoot , we think : Stolen organs are about as old as Robin Cook , and the health care plan called Caduceus 21 that doubles as a front for organ-dealing just as obvious . <p> But global modern life is a war , Chiu demonstrates , returning often to previous wars ( the Ameriasian Dupree is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Israelis vs . Palestinians on the West Bank ; Serbs vs . Muslims in Bosnia ; Hutus vs . Tutsis in Rwanda ; Indonesians vs . Timorese in East Timor . " In each , we find , Dr. Dupree " had been at the epicenter . " The novel portrays genocide as so ordinary around the globe that organ-stealing seems routine , but we do n't buy it . <p> A context that is far more believable is the New York public defender 's office in KEY WITNESS by J.F. Freedman ( Dutton ; 528 pages ; $ 23.95 ) : Here successful uptown attorney Wyatt Matthews has burned himself out representing " multibillion-dollar corporations " that ruin the lives of " poor innocent schmucks " and ventures downtown to try his hand " defend(ing) an actual client . " It 's chilling to watch modern " justice " at work when most criminals are considered guilty and plea-bargained into jail , but we 're intrigued , too , when Wyatt defends a robber who finds himself caught up in a killer 's conspiracy . <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight in modern thrillers . An overworked public defenders ' paralegal , Josephine DiStephano , knows more about the legal system than many of the lawyers in the P.D . office and is reassuring and wisely assertive as Wyatt 's case explodes . A therapist gives Wyatt 's wife , Moira , and daughter a chance to register their growing alienation when a catastrophe hits the family . And Moira speaks for many victims when she suspects criminal defense lawyers of wanting so much to win that they forget the impact on society of robbers , rapists and murderers wandering free . <p> Perhaps the biggest surprise of the summer is MISSING PIECES by Joy Fielding ( Doubleday ; 368 pages ; $ 23.95 ) . Here is that rarest of treats , a good thriller about a vicious serial killer that 's written with a kind of dry hilarity . <p> " Women , it seems , go missing all the time , " Kate Sinclair muses about the two dozen women who have disappeared from the Palm Beach , Fla. , area where she lives . A therapist whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , Kate wanders into amusing digressions that make the story 's horrors palatable . She remembers , for example , her daughter Sara 's first menstruation , when the rebellious 15-year-old " took the pads I gave her and skulked from the room , as if this appalling state of affairs was something I 'd wished on her . The next morning , I asked if the pads had interfered with her sleep . She looked horrified . ' You mean you have to wear them at night ? ' " <p> It 's the kind of family humor that Kate , her husband Larry and their two daughters have shared for years , but now Sara has been caught lying and stealing , smoking and taking drugs , and dodging school . At the same time , Kate 's mother appears to be poisoning everyone at her retirement home by cooking with dish washing powder , and Kate 's sister Jo Lynn has turned into a courtroom groupie for a suspected serial killer named Colin Friendly . <p> " Do n't you think he 's gorgeous ? " JoLynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during Colin 's trial . When Kate , aghast , shakes her head , JoLynn insists that " he looks just like Brad Pitt , " that his murderous smile is " just boyish bravado " and that she 's going to sit in the courtroom every day " and watch . I 'll be there for him . " <p> That Jo Lynn actually becomes a player in Colin 's trial and love life becomes less horrifying than it might be because of a similar longing that emerges in Kate : When she runs into a high school boyfriend , now 50 , and finds sexually pent-up feelings suddenly exploding , her own irrationality parallels that of her sister 's  --  and of her mother 's and daughters ' . <p> All along the question of women 's safety  --  in the places they travel , the secrets they keep and the choices they make  --  emerges as a central theme , reminding us why we read trashy novels to begin with . Surely more than " escapist fiction , " these books tell us something about changing gender roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risky social behavior and realistic aspirations in modern culture . <p> It 's fun to root for a protagonist who 's right on the edge of those changes rather than stuck in an old pathology , and if that protagonist is a woman , as are her readers , would n't Milton Friedman be proud ? It could mean the wants of the marketplace are being felt by manufacturers of " products " that reflect true social change . Now let 's see how long it lasts .
