<p> Despite the efforts of automobile manufacturers to make their cars more theft-resistant , the pilfering of cars and vans is an enormous problem . According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , more than one million cars were stolen in the United States last year , while millions more were stripped of reusable parts . <p> Auto theft was worse than any other property crime last year , reports the National Automobile Theft Bureau . A car is stolen every 20 seconds in this country at an annual cost to consumers of more than $7 billion . <p> The most amazing of all is this FBI fact : Of all the cars stolen last year , nearly 80% were unlocked and more than 40% of those unlocked actually had the keys left in the ignition ! <p> The culprits are not just professional thieves , but amateurs as well ; many of them are juveniles looking to steal a car for a joy ride or to resell parts to support a drug habit . <p> Here 's how to fight back before your car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Measures <p> Do n't make your car an easy mark for thieves . Even if it contains all the " bells and whistles " of an eleborate security system , heed these precautions : Whenever you leave your car , lock the doors , the trunk ( or tailgate ) , and roll up the windows tight . ( With their vast array of tools , thieves can work wonders getting through the smallest window opening . ) Do n't invite a break-in by leaving packages , luggage , or valuables in sight . Take these items with you , or lock them in your trunk when no one is watching . Likewise , avoid keeping your title or auto registration in your glove compartment unless your state law requires it . A thief could use these to resell your car . Store spare keys in your wallet , not in your car . Hiding extra keys under the frame is asking for trouble ; a determined thief knows where to find them . If you must leave a key with a parking lot attendant , leave only your ignition key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the claim check with you ; ideally , your car ca n't be removed without it . As an added safeguard , never put your name and license number on your keychain . Your lost keys could lead a thief to your car . Auto thieves can strip a car naked where it stands in a matter of minutes , so take special parking precautions . If you must park on the street , pick a spot that is well lit and heavily trafficked at night . In the driveway , park your car with the nose toward the street so anyone tampering with the engine can be seen easily . To make towing difficult , turn the steering wheel all the way to the right or left before you lock the steering column . Also put the car in park or in gear and set the emergency brake . Never leave your car running , no matter how quick the errand . This is practically an invitation for a thief to steal your car . Other Deterrents <p> It has been shown that a thief with the proper tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . By making it as time-consuming as possible to steal your car , you are improving the odds against your car 's becoming a theft statistic . Even minimal measures can help ward off trouble and buy precious time the thief does n't have . Among them are : If you have an older car with top-mounted , mushroom shaped door lock buttons , replace them with slim , tapered ones . Tapered buttons are almost impossible to pull up with a coat hanger . Mark you car with burglar alarm or other anti-theft device warning decals . Whether you actually use an anti-theft device or not , the decal will make thieves think twice about tinkering with your auto . Participate in a neighborhood , city , or state anti-theft campaign , and label your car accordingly . In Cleveland , Ohio , for example , thousands of motorists have joined a sticker program called SCAT ( Stop Cleveland Auto Theft ) . Under this program , people who register their cars with the police may be stopped for no reason between midnight and 5 a.m . Decals placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCAT member cars and to stop them during these abnormal driving hours . Similar programs are in the works across the country . Anti-Theft Devices <p> Within the last decade , car makers have greatly improved their security designs to help you protect your new-car investment . Their anti-theft devices , ranging from $50 locks to $1,000-plus automatic alarms and disabling devices , are typically offered as standard equipment on expensive cars , optional on others . <p> Not to be overlooked , however , are the variety of aftermarket anti-theft accessories which are equally effective and which may cost less than standard or optional car equipment . Many automotive parts stores , mass merchandisers , electronics stores , and new-car dealerships carry anti-theft devices . The last two sources may be best , since they typically provide professional installation as well . <p> Bear in mind that no factory or aftermarket security option can provide absolute protection . They can make it harder for a thief to make off with your car . <p> Aftermarket anti-theft devices generally fall into three categories : visible deterrents , hidden electronic deterrents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of the pros and cons of each . <p> Visible Deterrents . These include steering locks such as armored collars and crook locks . Armored collars are metal shields that lock around the steering column and cover the ignition . Crook locks are cane-like bars that lock the brake pedal with the steering wheel to keep thieves from driving away . A less convenient variation links the gas and brake pedals together . <p> Steering locks are inexpensive ( $50 to $100 ) , simple to use and highly visible . You install them yourself and only need a key to remove them . While steering locks can deter a thief from driving off with your car , they wo n't protect radios or other items inside the car . Nor will they prevent towing . <p> There are also locks , visible and otherwise , made for various marketable parts of a car . Battery locks , wheel locks , and special tape deck lock mounts can save these items plus any damage that may occur in the process of stealing them . A locking gas cap is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel , it can limit a thief to the amount of driving he or she can do on one tank of gas . <p> Hidden Electronic Devices . These products cost $100 and up , excluding professional installation . This category includes hidden kill switches and plug-type kill switches for the ignition , and hidden cutoff valves ( fuel switches ) for the fuel supply . The hidden kill switch is a plain switch hidden somewhere in your car . The switch must be activated before your engine will turn over . The plug-type kill switch uses a plug that can be detached from the dashboard and carried around until the driver is ready to start the car . The plug is made up of a series of adapters that plug into little steel shafts . Without this device plugged in , there is no way to start the car . The fuel switch , which can be hidden virtually anywhere in your car , is a device designed to shut off the flow of gasoline into your carburetor . Even if a thief gets the car started , it wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thief gets anywhere . <p> Slightly more expensive designs combine an ignition interrupt with a hood lock . These are set with a key or with a numbered pad into which you punch a code . They require professional installation . <p> As for drawbacks : Kill switches do n't protect the car 's contents or prevent towing . And , since some are n't visible from the outside , you risk break-in damage before a thief finds out that the car wo n't run . Alarms <p> Alarms have come a long way since the time when their only trick was to bleat until help arrived or the battery ran down . <p> Most contemporary alarms are available with passive arming , which means they automatically switch on a few moments after you leave your car . Some passive alarm systems even lock the doors behind you ; the most advanced are smart enough not to lock you out if , by chance , you leave your keys in the ignition . <p> Insurance companies view passive arming as an effective theft deterrent ; in many states companies offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm system feature . <p> Once armed , today 's alarms have many ways of detecting mischief . The least expensive sytems ( under $250 ) trigger an alarm when they sense the voltage drop that occurs when a door opens and the dome light switches on , or when a foot stepping on the brake pedal causes the brake lights to go on . <p> More sophisticated systems ( $250 and up ) have even more ways of sensing trouble . For example , those with tilt-and-motion detectors trigger an alarm if someone tries to tow your car away , or jacks it up to steal your wheels . <p> Other types of sensors start an alarm if they detect shock or impact caused by an attempt to steal your car . <p> The best of these are adjustable , so they wo n't trigger an alarm when vibration is sensed from a passing vehicle . Some alarm systems can even sense when the door handle is being touched . <p> Other sensors are available for special applications , such as for convertibles and the open beds of pickup trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place of snaps that secure canvas covers on a truck bed . There are also pressure sensors which can be installed in the seats and under floor mats . Still other kinds of systems flood the vehicle 's interior with infrared , ultrasonic , or radar waves to detect intruders . <p> Most of the newer , keyless remote alarm systems turn on or off by a small transmitter on a keychain . Most also can be triggered manually , a feature which can help scare off anyone who tries to attack you while you 're en route to your car . Some can be activated while your car is in motion , in case you catch a thief in the act . <p> The most elaborate electronic alarm systems ( costing from $400 to more than $1,000 ) combine many of the above features with a multichannel radio transmitter to trigger other devices . For example , you can turn driveway or house lights on and set your home alarm from the front seat of your car . <p> The drawback to car alarms is that their warning sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , D.C. , has not found any study demonstrating that car alarms are effective at preventing theft . A Fordham University study found that few people notify police when they see a car being stolen , noting that an alarm was " not likely " to cause witnesses to take action . Getting Your Car Back <p> Chances of recovering a stolen car are better than 60% , but damage and theft of contents and accessories will make your car worth less than it was before it was stolen . <p> Law enforcement agencies often can recover stolen cars if the police have the vehicle identification number ( VIN ) . <p> Because thieves may alter this number , look for your VIN on the serial plate , and mark it in several hard-to-find spots on the car ( underneath the rocker panels , the upper inside portion of your trunk , etc . ) . <p> You might also drop a business card or a piece of paper with your name and address on it into the window channel of your car door . If police have trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door to discover your calling card . <p> It will also help to join Operation Identification if your community has such a program . Your police or sheriff will loan you an engraving tool for marking your vehicle and other valuables with a permanent number . This I.D . number makes it hard to unload-and easy to trace-stolen property . <p> Note : On April 24 , 1986 , Congress ruled that certain parts on " high-theft " cars must be marked with an identification number put on by the manufacturer . <p> By Walter W.
