On their last day in Puerto Vallarta , the fathers rented horses . Ellen 's father let her come along , though she was only eleven and had n't ridden before . She stayed close to his side , staring at the tin shacks and rows of hobbled corn along the back streets . Her father drank wine from a pig-bladder pouch and gave her a sip when she asked . It was sour and hot . He bought her a sombrero embroidered with green and pink flowers , and placed it carefully over her head . Gradually , they drifted apart from the others . <p> Ellen was rarely alone with her father . She and her parents had joined two other families in Mexico , and for ten days had descended in large , whooping groups over local cafes and beaches . Her father told jokes and chose restaurants , whatever people wanted . He was Master of Ceremonies . <p> " Are n't we meeting Mom for lunch ? " Ellen asked when the two of them reached a strip of pressed , pale dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Want to turn around ? " <p> Slowly , Ellen shook her head . <p> " Me either , " her father said . <p> He leaned close to Ellen , surrounding her with a fresh , wet smell like cut grass . Then he set his watch back . It took an instant , a twirl of the tiny hands , and they were free . Ellen felt a thrill of mischief , and a nervous grin split her face . She did not think of her mother , only of a hurdle she and her father had leapt together . As they rode on , she stared greedily at each dry bush and blotched , scampering pig . <p> " When I was young , " her father said , staring at the horizon , " I bought a motorcycle and rode around Europe for months . " <p> Ellen had never heard this before . " Was it fun ? " she asked . <p> " I lived like a maniac . " <p> She paused , unsure if this was good or bad . " Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fun . Was it fun . " He stared across the miles of dead grass and shook his head . " It was the best time of my life . " <p> Ellen grew suddenly shy . She followed her father 's gaze to the horizon , where faded earth nudged a faded sky . It looked like the edge of something hidden , a place her father alone had explored . <p> " Come on , " she said , kicking the shaggy sides of her pony . As it stamped into the hot , dry wind she felt a longing never to go back . <p> " You 're a hooligan , " her father laughed when he 'd caught up to her . <p> " I 'm a maniac , " Ellen said . <p> The sun was low when they finally returned to the beach . Ellen 's mother , Vivian , waited on the cooling sand . When she saw them she jumped to her feet . " Thank God , " she cried . " I thought you 'd been robbed or something . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I swear it 's running backwards . " <p> " Well , your lunches are here if you want them , " Vivian said . " Then I guess we 'd better pack . " <p> Ellen sank onto the sand and began eating frantically . The sandwiches were warm from hours of heat . Her mother did n't ask where Ellen and her father had been , she just stared across the water . It was the last day of their vacation . <p> " I 'm sorry , Mom , " Ellen said through a mouthful of food . " I 'm sorry you were by yourself . " <p> Her father cleared his throat and stood up . <p> Vivian looked at Ellen curiously . " Relax , " she said . " What could you have done ? " <p> In the five years since that trip , there had been no time for family vacations ; Ellen 's father traveled too much on business . This year he was selling franchises for Tommy 's , a lobster restaurant in downtown Detroit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tell prospective investors . " Quality like that you ca n't find nowadays . " Ellen imagined sometimes that Tommy was the name of his son from an earlier marriage , some young prodigy living in another state . <p> At one time Vivian had gone with him on his trips . Lately she stayed home , though , conditioning her hair and soaking her Boston ferns in the kitchen sink . She grew thin , and reminisced about their trips . <p> " I was almost killed in Jamaica , " she said at breakfast . " Your dad swam away from our boat and a wind came . I started sailing out to sea . " <p> She spoke with the urgency of a first telling , though Ellen had heard the story many times . <p> " What a nightmare , " her father said , looking up from his paper . " You were going so fast I could n't catch up . I was splashing around , screaming how to turn the boat , but you could n't hear me . " <p> " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood of the story . <p> " I jumped off , " her mother said . " I swam back to your father . The boat kept going . " She was washing apples in the kitchen sink . Now she stopped , still holding the colander under the running faucet , and turned to her husband . Ellen 's parents looked at one another , and Ellen felt a current of something between them which startled her . <p> After a moment they looked away . Her mother shook the colander under the water . Ellen heard apples bumping against its sides . Her father put on his coat , shaking the sleeves gently over his arms . He was leaving for the airport , catching a plane to Australia . <p> " I have an idea , " he said , kissing them each goodbye . " Easter 's six weeks away . We 'll go back to Puerto Vallarta . " <p> While her father was in Australia , Ellen went with her friend Renata to a Mexican restaurant in Glencoe . It was a train ride outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and had promised to serve them alcohol . Ellen had never been to a bar before . She ordered a rum cocktail crowded with small umbrellas and leaned back , crossing her legs in a way she hoped was sophisticated . Then , at a corner table half-hidden by a ficus , Ellen saw her father . <p> She sat very still , lips on her straw , and tried to make sense of this . He had left for Australia six days ago , and was not due back for four more . He sat with another man and two women , one of whom wore the striped tennis sweater Ellen had given her father last Christmas . The woman had on salmon-colored lipstick . Her hand rested on Ellen 's father 's shoulder . <p> Ellen carefully set down her glass . She blinked at her smeared reflection in the strip of brass that ran along the bar , then looked back at her father . He had a large , vivid face , shaped like the spade on a playing card . His eyes were gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked  --  handsome the way strangers are , people on buses or in the supermarket . A sharp , metallic taste filled her mouth . Her father was handsome , a handsome man in a restaurant surrounded by other handsome people who were his friends . He talked , he moved his hands , and as Ellen watched she began to feel that she herself had no right to be here . He belonged wherever he was . <p> When the group stood up she swiveled toward the bar and hunched over her drink . Renata had gone to the bathroom , and Eric was washing glasses at the sink . Ellen heard her father 's loud laugh behind her , and was overcome with a sudden , dreamlike calm , as if moments from now she would realize that none of this had happened . A car pulled up to the restaurant . There were shoes on the pavement , laughter , shutting doors . When the left rear door stuck , Ellen knew the car was her father 's Six days ago he 'd driven that car to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the tinted windshield . <p> When she heard nothing but silence , Ellen slid from her stool and went outside the restaurant . She was panting , and her heartbeat made her dizzy . It was dusk . A curved driveway arched toward the door of the restaurant , and beyond it sprawled the wide suburban parking lot . Ellen looked across it . She felt a pain somewhere inside her , but could n't find its source . She stared at the passing cars , the pale moon rising over the asphalt . " Where does it hurt ? " her mother would ask . " Where does it hurt the most ? " It hurt everywhere , she thought . It did n't hurt enough . <p> Ellen searched the frail rim of trees around the lot , the sky soaked in dusk . Everything looked wrong to her , garish and soiled . Two hours ago , she and Renata had skipped across this lot , running their hands along cars and loudly debating what drinks they should order : Martinis ? Bloody Marys ? Pina coladas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her childhood Ellen wanted nothing more than to pick up where that memory had ended , to go back inside and burrow in the company of Eric and Renata . They had n't seen her father , they had no idea . It was almost like not having seen him herself . <p> During the ride back to Chicago , Ellen rocked against the seat of Eric 's car , impatient to throw herself in her mother 's arms and be soothed . Her mother had long , cool hands and hair like a lioness . She was the most comforting person on earth . <p> Ellen found her mother seated on the living-room floor , her hair in a scarf . She had the dreamy look she often wore after spending several hours by herself . <p> " I 'm rearranging , " she said . " Dusting . " <p> Around her lay things she had bought on her various trips : inlaid wood chests , cornhusk dolls , animals carved from ivory . In a glass dish were the colored marble eggs she had bought with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ribs . <p> " I 've lost perspective , " her mother said . " Can you see any difference ? " <p> Ellen wished she were back at the age when she would howl shamelessly while her mother used a tweezer to pick bits of gravel from her skinned knees . Her mother looked as frail to her now , as easy to shatter , as the blown-glass vase she was holding . <p> " Mom , " Ellen said . <p> Vivian looked up . The room was very still . Ellen felt the weight of the old house , its dense curtains and clean , swept kitchen . Her mother 's world was reliable , steadfast , decent . The fun was elsewhere . <p> " What is it ? " her mother asked . <p> Ellen sank to the floor and lifted a crimson egg from the dish . She felt a ghastly power , the kind she felt sometimes when using a knife or scissors . once while she was chopping celery she had glanced at her mother 's pale arm and thought with horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had pictured the bright stripe of blood , her mother 's look of surprise and pain . She had tortured herself with these thoughts for several moments before putting down the knife and wrapping her mother tightly in her arms . As she hugged , Vivian had begun to laugh . " Such affection , " she 'd said . " What have I done to deserve this ? " <p> " Oh , your father called tonight , " she said now . " From Sydney . He sends a kiss . " <p> Ellen stared at her . " How 's he doing ? " she managed to ask . <p> " Lonely , " said her mother . " At least the weather 's good . " <p> Ellen leaned back against her hands . She watched the long cords of her mother 's neck , the fragile blade of her chin , and was suddenly furious at Vivian for letting herself be fooled , for knowing less than Ellen did . " How come you do n't go with him anymore ? " Ellen demanded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She polished another egg , then looked back at Ellen . " What makes you ask ? " <p> Ellen felt a surge of guilt , as if she and her father were in this thing together . She avoided her mother 's eyes . " I think it 's Tommy 's , " she said . " I think it keeps him busy . " <p> " Exactly , " her mother said . <p> Ellen 's father brought her a glass paperweight shaped like a kangaroo and a T-shirt which said SYDNEY . She felt senseless , giddy relief as he talked about the vineyards he had seen , their blond dirt and acrid smell of ripeness . That night at the Mexican restaurant was something separate , something cordoned off . It made no difference . She thought about it constantly . <p> Ellen and her parents flew to Puerto Vallarta two days before Easter . They rented a small house outside of town , where flowers poured from the cliffs in a bright , clotted rush . Their first morning they sat on the terrace , eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed Morgan ? " her father said . " He 's building some condos up the hill . I should take a look , the poor guy . " <p> Her mother rolled her eyes . " Ed Morgan , " she said . " I think I 'll meet you in town . " <p> Ellen watched her father . She watched him constantly now , searching for signs of restlessness or boredom . often his eyes had the fractured , glossy look of something repaired with too much glue . He would glance at his watch as though tracking events somewhere else . Ellen felt a continual need to distract him , to hold his attention . <p> " I 'll go with you , " she said . <p> " It 's hot up there , Squirrel . " <p> " So ? " <p> Her parents exchanged looks of surprise . Ellen felt her mother 's gaze , the soft eyes in a face as rigid and spare as a kitchen table . She could still remember a time when her mother would lie in bed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father brought from the French bakery . He would rest his head on Vivian 's stomach and protest that she was dropping crumbs in his eyes . " oh hush , " she would say , licking her fingers one at a time . But she was n't like that now . She was a person who got left in other people 's wakes . <p> Ellen and her father drove up the mountain road in a rattling jeep . His elbow pointed out the window . Ellen pointed her own the same way . She kept her eyes on the wet curl of growth which sprang from the red dirt . Beside them , cliffs dropped straight to the sea . <p> " Am I a lot like Mom ? " she asked . <p> " In some ways , " he said . " Although you 've got my adventurous streak , that 's a difference . " He drove with one finger on the wheel , making it look easy . When Ellen learned to drive this year , she would drive like that . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning . <p> Ellen smiled at the wind , letting its hot blast dry her lips and teeth . " I hope so , " she said . <p> Ed Morgan had a greasy , cream-colored beard and the sort of skin that can only grow more red . He picked his way toward them over mounds of steaming earth . Skeleton houses dotted the land : fresh blond planks shimmering in the midday sun . A bulldozer smeared the air with its heat . <p> " I did n't know you had a daughter , " Ed said , pouring them each a vodka at a flimsy outdoor table . <p> Ellen 's father chuckled . " I keep her hidden . " <p> " No wonder , " Ed said , winking at Ellen as he handed her a glass . He gave off a meaty smell , as if the sun had partially cooked him . The heat soaked Ellen 's dark hair , making her feel almost faint . <p> " You may want to skip the booze , Squirrel , " her father said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was nervous , and felt a rare , tenuous power over him . She took a large sip . " Delicious , " she lied . <p> Her father smiled uneasily and looked at his watch . " We 're in and out of here , " he said . <p> " Relax , " Ed told him . " Hang around a little . " <p> He topped off Ellen 's glass , filling it so high that the vodka spilled on her fingers when she tried to lift it . She and Ed toasted and drank . Vodka fumes flooded her throat , nearly gagging her . Ellen was desperate to keep the tiny edge she 'd gained on her father , no matter what it took . He watched her , shifting in his seat . <p> " How go the legal battles , Morgan ? " he asked . <p> Ed sighed . " About the same . only the lawyers win . " <p> Ellen took another sip . It brought tears to her eyes . <p> " Look at this , " Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old block . " <p> Her father laughed weakly . " Christ , let 's hope not , " he said . <p> When it became too hot to sit still , Ed took them on a tour of his construction site . Ellen was barely able to keep her balance as they padded over the hot , soft earth . <p> " Take my arm , Squirrel , " her father said , watching her with concern . Ellen could see he was anxious to get away . She asked every question she could think of , drawing out the visit . <p> Finally they reached the Jeep . Ed 's face was scarlet , running with sweat . He looked on the verge of collapse . Ellen felt a sudden great affection for this harmless , clownish man who had been her accomplice . She was sorry to leave him . When the men had shaken hands , she kissed Ed goodbye on the lips . <p> Her father gripped the wheel with both hands as they headed back down the mountain . " I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . He spoke in an easy , joking way , but he was n't smiling . <p> " You drank , " Ellen said , letting her head loll against the seat . " You drink a lot . " <p> " Your mother 's not going to like it . " <p> " Are we telling her ? " <p> He glanced at Ellen , then back at the road . " Well no , " he said . " I guess we 'd better not . " <p> Ellen watched the ocean for a while , her head spinning . " What are Ed 's legal battles ? " she asked . <p> Her father explained that Ed had owned a company in Chicago which went bankrupt three years before . Now he was being sued by his former employees . <p> " Is he guilty ? " Ellen asked . <p> Her father hesitated . " He lied too much , " he said . " If he 'd told some truth and let the pressure off , he 'd be in a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant he was guilty or not . <p> " He should 've told just enough to win people over , " her father said . " Enough to look honest . " <p> Ellen nodded in silence . <p> " As little as possible , but something . " <p> " I see . " <p> " If you have to lie you 're already in danger . " <p> They rode in silence . Just outside of town Ellen turned to her father , raising her voice above the engine . " Dad , " she said , " have you gone out with anyone else while you and Mom have been married ? " <p> His small , gray eyes were fastened to the road . " of course not , " he said . <p> " If the answer was yes would you tell me ? " <p> Her father sighed . " No , Squirrel , " he said . " I probably would n't . " <p> " Well , " Ellen said , pleased by the calm in her voice , " then you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was not at the cafe where they had arranged to meet . Her father put his hands in his pockets and stared at the breaking waves , which were crowded with the bobbing heads of children . Then he looked at his watch . " We 're late , " he said . <p> They sat without speaking . Her father ordered a beer and drank it quickly . He cracked his knuckles one by one . " Let 's take a look around , " he said . <p> The streets were crowded with Mexican families celebrating the holiday . There were women in black dresses made of cotton , girls whose thin , dusty legs teetered over high heels as they trod the mud streets . The air smelled of bitter Mexican beer . <p> Ellen 's father stayed close to her as they wove through the crowds . He would crane his neck to look for her mother , then glance quickly back at Ellen . Ellen began to wander more often from his side , peering with sudden interest into the windows of shops while her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm around her , cupping her shoulder in his palm . His hand was large and warm , and Ellen relaxed in the safety of his grip . She steered him into a sweet shop , where he bought her coffee ice cream on a heat-softened cone . In a silversmith 's window , a pair of turquoise earrings caught her eye . <p> " Better wait till we get home before you put these on , " her father said , chuckling as he counted out the bills . " They 're pretty flashy . " <p> Ellen smiled sweetly and slipped the earrings on . <p> So much attention from her father was exhausting , and she felt a giddy tremor rising from her stomach . She tossed her head so the earrings bumped her cheek . She looked for her mother , hoping not to find her . <p> Finally they stopped . Her father shielded his eyes and turned in a full circle , staring over the crowds . A group of children scampered past , dragging a blue , donkey-shaped pinata through the dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ellen noticed some of them watching her , and was conscious of her thin , bare arms , the tiny hairs on her thighs . <p> " I have an idea , " her father said . " I 'll ask the guy in that shop if he 's seen her . It 's the kind of place she likes . " He pointed to a store which sold clay jugs sprinkled with a thin , clear glaze like sugared water . Beyond it , several men in bare feet and hats lounged against a wall . <p> " I 'll wait here , " Ellen said . " Come on , Squirrel . It 'll take a second . " He took her elbow , but Ellen pulled away . <p> " I 'll wait , " she insisted , flushing to the neck . <p> Her father 's eyes darted along the street . " Just do n't move , " he said , jogging toward the shop . " I mean it , Squirrel . You stay put . " <p> The moment he was gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few shielded their eyes to look up at her . They were squatting in the dust , passing a bottle around . She stood before them with one leg bent , staring at the exhausted plaster between their shoulders . Her heart was beating fast . She glanced back at the shop to make sure her father had n't reappeared . His Spanish was poor ; the conversation would take a while . Her own mischief struck her as irrepressibly funny , and she gritted her teeth to keep from laughing . <p> They were young men , smooth-faced and a little shy . They spoke to her in Spanish , but Ellen smiled and shrugged her helplessness . They laughed , shaking their heads , and Ellen saw herself : a thin girl of sixteen with long strands of dark hair , resisting the flow of traffic to stand before these men in silence . It was a senseless , hilarious sight . She felt like crying . <p> One of the men slowly rose to his feet and came toward her . " Hola , chica , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt as though some force were acting on her , making her breathless and dizzy . " Hola , " she said , extending her hand toward the man as if she had just been introduced . <p> The man 's fingers tightened around her own . Ellen tried to slide from his grip , but he clung so hard it hurt . He was grinning at her . Ellen felt the pulse of his hand , the layer of sweat gathering between his skin and hers . She found herself grinning helplessly back , transfixed by the danger . The other men called and dapped , stamping their feet on the dirt . The music seemed louder . The man who held her wrist began to pull her down the street . <p> She heard running behind her , the sound of her father 's shouts . He pushed the man away , knocking him into the dust . The man landed in a roll , and when Ellen 's father followed him , he sprang to his feet , poised in a crouch . He was holding a knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chest . Her father froze . A whimper rose in Ellen 's throat , and he turned at the sound . The man with the knife slipped into the throng . <p> Ellen 's father grabbed her arm and pulled her against him so hard that her head knocked the bones of his chest . She found that she was crying ; the sobs were effortless as laughter . The sweet tastes of vodka and ice cream hung at the back of her throat , and she gulped them down . Her father stroked her hair . Through his ribs Ellen felt the urgent beating of his heart . It filled her with relief , as if it were this precise sound she 'd been waiting for all her life . <p> Ellen 's mother wandered from an alley . She was walking slowly , carrying packages wrapped in paper . Wedged in a cone of newsprint was a bouquet of crepe flowers : dry , colored petals fastened together with wire . <p> " Vivian , " Ellen 's father cried , letting her go . " Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You were late , " Vivian said , looking rather pleased . " I got sick of waiting . " <p> He shook his head , breathing hard . " Keeping up with you two is some job . " <p> " Oh ? " She smiled . " Maybe you 're out of practice . " <p> Ellen 's father put an arm around each of them and headed toward the beach . He held tightly , and it seemed to Ellen that he cared more for them now , at this moment , than he had in a long time . He was scared . She could not remember seeing him scared before . <p> He led them to a restaurant near the beach . A virulent sun lay dose to the horizon , and the air felt steamy and dense . Ellen 's father leaned back and clasped his hands behind his head . Then he flattened them on the table and spread the fingers . <p> " I 've got a confession to make , " he said . " I 've had an affair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They stared at him . He was folding and unfolding his napkin . The cloth shook in his fingers . He looked up suddenly , before Ellen could look away , and their eyes locked . <p> " Five years ago , " he said , speaking directly at Ellen . " In Kansas City , Missouri . A salesgirl I met on her lunch break . " <p> Ellen looked at her woven place mat and listened to her heart . It bumped in a scary , irregular way , and she wondered if she were old enough to have a heart attack . Her mother sat up straight . <p> " Why in God 's name are you saying this now ? " she asked . <p> He did n't answer . His eyes were still on Ellen , as if awaiting some sign from her . She thought of the day five years ago when he 'd moved the <p> hands of his watch , her delight at being part of the conspiracy . She looked at him now : handsome , grave , penitent . His hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd been following him for weeks . <p> " He 's lying , " she said . <p> Her mother 's lips parted . Light shone along the bottoms of her teeth . <p> Ellen stood up . " Lying , " she said again , letting the word rise from her mouth like a bubble . " He never went to Australia . I saw him in a restaurant with a girl . " <p> She glanced at her father and saw his mouth ringed with white . Without another word she turned and walked toward the sea , letting the breeze fill her ears and block out every other sound . The water was rough , and its frothy edge bubbled over her feet . Ellen took a few more steps until the churning water scrubbed her shins , then her thighs . She had an urge to swim in her clothes , to feel the fabrics float around her in the warm tide . <p> Slowly she moved forward , letting the water cover her by degrees . Then a wave reared in front of her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salty blow to her head and then she was beyond the breaking surf . <p> Several minutes later , she saw her mother on the beach . Ellen called to her and waved her arms , expecting to be ordered ashore immediately . Instead , Vivian moved closer to the water , keeping her eyes on Ellen . She stepped into the waves with great care , as if fearful that sharp things might be hidden in the sand . Soon the rim of her dress floated around her waist . Standing that way , she looked like a girl , and Ellen was struck by the thought that her mother had once been her own age . She saw this now in the fine , pale bones of her face , in the wet hair sticking to her head . <p> " Swim , " Ellen called to her . <p> Vivian hesitated , then pushed off . She swam in the smooth , even crawl she used for laps in a pool . The waves jostled her , upsetting the neat strokes . <p> When she finally reached Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazement . Her head seemed tiny in its slick coating of hair . <p> " We 've lost our minds , " she said with a high , nervous laugh . <p> Ellen was aware of not thinking about her father , and this gave her a fragile sense of freedom . <p> Her mother treaded water , looking up at the sky . Suddenly she turned to Ellen and grasped her hand underwater Ellen felt her mother grow perfectly still . After a moment Vivian let go and began swimming back . Ellen followed . <p> A wave washed them in , and Ellen found herself sprawled beside her mother on the sand . Her father was nowhere in sight . Vivian 's frail , bent limbs showed through her wet dress . Ellen looked down at her own Mexican shirt and saw that its bright pinks and greens had drained away . A sudden despair overwhelmed her . She buried her feet in the sand and grasped a damp , gritty handful in each fist . She had an urge to put some in her mouth and suck the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked , ashamed of the tremor in her voice . <p> Vivian was kneeling , shivering a little . She put an arm around Ellen 's shoulders . " We 're going back to the house to dry off , " she said . " That 's what . " <p> She pulled her daughter to her feet , surprising Ellen with the strength of her arms . Ellen leaned against her , allowing herself to be led through the sand . " And after that , " her mother said , holding Ellen tightly , " we 're getting out of this . " <p> <p> By Jennifer Egan <p>
