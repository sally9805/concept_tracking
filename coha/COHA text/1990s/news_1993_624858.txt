<p> Becky Wiley struggles to be fair , aware that her words might be hurtful to the Harris County sheriff 's detectives who have worked long hours in a fruitless effort to solve her daughter 's murder . <p> A deeply religious woman , Wiley says that during each day of the nearly 11 months since her daughter and a young playmate were stabbed to death , she has held fast to the belief that the girls ' killer will be found and punished , in this world and the next . <p> Today , she says , she is still certain of the latter . <p> In the meantime , she has some advice for other residents of the county 's vast unincorporated areas : " " You do n't ever want a crime to happen to you at all , " she says quietly . " " But if it does , do n't let it happen to you in Harris County . " <p> The case of Kristin Wiley , 10 , and Kynara Carreiro , 7 , who were stabbed to death July 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unwelcome spotlight on the tiny homicide division at the Harris County Sheriff 's Department , renewing old , damaging questions about its ability to solve any but the most straightforward murders . <p> Those involved in the girls ' case , one of the most poignant and most publicized in county history , remain hopeful that it will be solved . But even if it is , many critics believe the case will stand as an embarrassing , detailed case study of an investigation that was bungled from its earliest moments . <p> They pointed to numerous mistakes , ranging from an incomplete canvass of the neighborhood to an inexplicable failure to test the clothing of a key suspect until long after the killings . <p> Several interviewed said the tragedy of the girls ' deaths recalled an old saying , echoed unconsciously by Becky Wiley but repeated for years around the criminal courthouse : " " If I ever get killed , be sure to drag me into the city , " where the case , inside the purview of the Houston Police Department , might have a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen said he is aware of the saying , and has heard it throughout his 30-year tenure with the department . He dismissed it , saying the adage is based on unfair and often erroneous courthouse gossip . <p> " " It 's real easy when you get a group of doctors , lawyers , whatever , to sit around and make these kinds of remarks and we understand that , " the sheriff said . " " When they come to us and say , " We 've got a problem , ' I say , " Show me , tell me which case . ' " <p> Klevenhagen strongly defended the abilities and professionalism of his homicide division , even as he noted the staffing and funding limitations under which it operates . He also said the murders handled by the division in 1992 included a series of uncommonly tough cases , including that of the young girls . <p> He pointed out that he has requested additional detectives for the division every year in recent memory , but has been turned down by Commissioners Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us , " he said . <p> Nonetheless , the sheriff said he would stack his detectives against any other homicide division , nationwide . <p> " " I think we 've come a long , long way , " he said . " " We are hampered by not enough personnel and not enough funding and , unfortunately , the cases the media tends to write about are sensational or the ones there are questions on . But there are a whole lot more we do an excellent job on . " <p> But others interviewed , both on- and off-the-record , said that like most cliches , the saying contains more than a little truth . For example , a grand jury last year summoned the homicide captain to chastise her for detectives ' inadequate investigation of an officer-involved shooting . <p> And most agreed that while both the reality and the reputation are changing  --  if slowly  --  some serious problems remain . <p> In dozens of interviews since January , prosecutors , defense attorneys , outside investigators , crime victims ' relatives and many Sheriff 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division and the quality of its investigations . With few exceptions , they spoke on condition of anonymity , noting the sensitivity of the subject . <p> From their words , a consensus emerges , an image of a division that is struggling to change , to become more professional , and to shake its old , bad reputation . <p> " " We 're trying real hard , " one homicide detective said . <p> " " There is some deadwood in the division , but as peers , we put pressure on them because that reflects on all of us . If someone in the division does a half-assed job , we 're all going to look bad . " <p> Another , interviewed separately , added : " " We just want to do our job , to do it efficiently and effectively , and have a good reputation . " <p> That may take time to change . <p> For instance , defense attorneys like Karen Zellars , Phil Scardino and Mack Arnold said that invariably they feel a sense of relief to learn that a client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not another agency . <p> " " It has been my experience that I have received better outcomes for the defendant when it 's a Sheriff 's Department case , " said Zellars , a former prosecutor who is now in private practice . <p> " " It 's common knowledge among the defense bar that you can usually find something wrong in those cases . " <p> On the other side , many prosecutors , who declined to be quoted by name , admitted that they still cringe when they see the red folders that signify cases handled by sheriff 's detectives , although several said the contents have recently improved . <p> District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. , too , left little doubt about his views . <p> " " If I had a loved one killed , I 'd want the homicide division of the Houston Police Department to investigate , " Holmes said . <p> " " They are capable of doing the most professional job of solving such a crime . " <p> Holmes also confirmed that his prosecutors , whose work requires them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies , have occasionally " " fussed " to him over the years about the quality of Sheriff 's Department investigations . <p> But most interviewed , especially those with the most direct and most current knowledge , agreed that in recent months they have seen incremental , steady improvement in cases handled by the sheriff 's homicide division . <p> The division , which has 22 detectives and three sergeants , along with its lieutenant and captain , investigates all crimes against persons in the county , including assaults , sexual assaults , suicides and kidnappings in addition to homicides . <p> In part , the sources credited a new emphasis on training and organization for the change . But most significantly , they said , the division in recent years has gained many new , more aggressive , better motivated and better trained detectives and supervisors . <p> For example , nearly half of the division 's detectives have joined it within the past two years , including many of those mentioned most often in positive terms . <p> Capt . Candy Henderson , who heads the division , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the improvement , saying the creation of teams has produced an intense competition for cleared cases among detectives and their sergeants . <p> And Henderson and other sheriff 's officials point with justifiable pride to the division 's statistics for the current year : through the end of May , county homicide detectives had cleared 21 of their 26 cases for a clearance rate of about 80 percent . <p> ( The national average clearance rate for police agencies each year tends to fall between 60 percent and 70 percent , according to FBI statistics . ) <p> " " It 's coming together , it 's working , " Klevenhagen said . <p> " " Just give us some easy cases . " <p> But it is also clear , from numerous interviews , that many problems remain , occasionally hampering the ability of the division either to solve its cases or conduct its business professionally . <p> Historically , the division has been faulted in a variety of areas , many of which are far from resolved : <p> No standard operating procedure , either at a scene or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't developed a comfortable , logical procedure , " said one knowledgeable source . <p> " " That 's something we 're working on right now , " Henderson said . While detectives have had for some time a checklist of actions to take at scenes or include in their reports , the division is now trying to improve and formalize its procedures . <p> Lack of training , including such areas as legal issues , interrogation techniques and the interpretation and collection of evidence . Maj. Eddie Macaluso , reassigned recently after nearly six years as the head of the investigative bureau , which includes the homicide division , said he has long wanted to increase training for detectives but has not had the money . <p> Recently , though , using money seized in drug cases , homicide detectives have been allowed to attend advanced training courses . <p> And the division , at the behest of its sergeants , has now formally outlined a list of courses recommended for new homicide investigators . <p> Lack of equipment and facilities . Since the investigative bureau 's move to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no formal interview room in which to interrogate suspects . The detectives have borrowed a sergeant 's room for important interviews , but also tell horror stories of trying to elicit confessions from suspects seated in the middle of their crowded main office . <p> The division recently decided to turn its classroom into two specially designed interview rooms , which are nearly complete . <p> Detectives also have worked until recently without even the most basic equipment , like crime scene tape . They now have it . And they have made a request , not yet approved , for laptop computers , which would allow them to interview witnesses on the county 's far-flung scenes , take written statements on the spot and get them signed , without requiring witnesses to accompany them downtown . <p> Impatient with the delays , some detectives have purchased their own . <p> Supervision . This area recently has undergone a relatively dramatic change , according to many within and outside the division . <p> " " Until recently , there have been real problems over there with supervision , with accounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with detectives , " one source said . " " It just did n't seem to get done . " <p> But he and others praised several new , tougher supervisors in the division , including Lt. Bert Diaz and Sgt. John Denholm , for requiring more accountability from their detectives . <p> Turf wars within the department . Conflicts occasionally develop between the technical services bureau , which includes the department 's crime scene units , and the investigative bureau , where the detectives work . <p> The dispute was evident even during interviews . Henderson , the homicide captain , said flatly that detectives ultimately are in charge of any crime scene . But Maj. John Matthews , who heads the technical services bureau , said no actual pecking order exists and that when the rare conflict develops , it is resolved by supervisors for those involved . <p> Some crime scene deputies have characterized certain detectives as " " pretty boys " who dislike getting their hands dirty . And detectives complained that a lack of support from crime scene personnel is a major problem affecting their ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that illustrated most of the problems , many said , one need look no further than the investigation into the violent deaths last July of Kynara and Kristin in the Wiley home in northwest Harris County . <p> From the outset , Sheriff 's Department officials have said they believe the girls knew their killer . Throughout the investigation , detectives have focused on several key suspects , including a neighbor who later admitted having misled investigators the first day . <p> As in the beginning , detectives recently blamed the neighbor , Rex Mays , for sidetracking the investigation . After failing two polygraph tests , Mays admitted he had lied to detectives by saying he had seen two unfamiliar men leap over his fence just before the girls ' bodies were discovered . <p> But the department 's inability so far to come up with the evidence to charge anyone has left the girls ' families , friends and many others frightened , angry and frustrated . <p> " " Sometimes I wonder if they really want to solve this goddamned case , " said Bob Carreiro , Kynara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent little girls . Why ca n't they treat it like it 's one of their own ? " <p> Henderson and other sheriff 's officials said they understand the families ' frustration but deny that the investigation has received less than full attention . <p> Prosecutors and detectives involved said they remain relatively hopeful that several items now being analyzed by the FBI , may yet produce enough evidence to file charges . Results of those tests are expected within the next six weeks , Henderson said . <p> But for several knowledgeable sources , the problems in the early going seemed like a case study of the homicide division 's difficulties : disorganization , loose supervision , shoddy follow-up and miscommunication between detectives and employees on the scene from other divisions or departments . <p> Last month , in what many viewed as a tacit admission of the problems , the division embarked on its second complete audit of the case . The decision followed a similar " " new start " in November , when the original detectives were removed from the case and new ones assigned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the investigation , said the audit will include reviewing or retesting much of the evidence and recanvassing the neighborhood , from which at least seven families have moved since the murders . <p> She downplayed its significance , however , describing audits as relatively routine in major , unsolved cases . <p> Others close to the investigation said it was tantamount to starting over  --  again . <p> " " If we had n't done so many things wrong the first time , maybe we would n't have to do it all over again now , " one departmental source said . " " It 's a whole new start . " <p> Mike Anderson , the prosecutor assigned to the case , said he has been encouraged by the recent action . <p> " " I think the guys working on this case now are wanting to solve this crime as much as anybody , " Anderson said . " " They 're retracing some of the steps they 've taken and looking at it all from a new perspective , which I think is a good thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case solved , both to bring the murderer to justice and ease the suffering of the girls ' survivors . <p> In the meantime , though , while conceding that it is slender comfort to the families , several also said they believe the mishandled case may one day be viewed as a turning point for the division . They said the widespread embarrassment over its handling already has forced some of the most recent , positive changes . <p> " " Maybe that 's the watershed event , what it 's going to take to turn this division around , " one said . " " I think a lot of the things we 've been able to do are because of the little girls ' case . " <p> And for that , Becky Wiley , Carreiro and other relatives said they were grateful . <p> " " None of this is ever going to bring the girls back , " Wiley said . " " But maybe it can keep another family from going through everything that we have . " <p> Odom , Kathryn <p> Murder victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 . <p> Place : 21400 block of Golden Dove , Spring . <p> Status : No charges filed . <p> Odom , 27 , was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her home . Her daughter , almost 5 , was knocked unconscious ; her infant son was not hurt . <p> Her father , Frank Martin , has blasted the department , calling detectives inept . Martin , for instance , found blood stains detectives missed in the home ; the blood was typed to his daughter . <p> He also talked with neighbors who had not been interviewed by detectives ; investigators told him they should have been more thorough . And he blames them for losing possible evidence that he found and turned in to them . <p> Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen calls Martin " " a nut case . " Officials also blame Russell Dunlap , a Houston detective assigned to the DA 's office , for the lost evidence . <p> But Dunlap , who also investigated the case , supports many of Martin 's complaints and expresses sympathy for the grieving father . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he found the items at the Department of Public Safety when sheriff 's detectives could not remember where they were . <p> Dunlap said he sent some of the evidence to labs for testing , turned the rest in to sheriff 's officials and watched as the items were locked in a cabinet . They have never been found . <p> Juanita Baird <p> Intended victim : Juanita Baird . <p> Date : Oct. 24 , 1991 . <p> Place : 4000 block of Vivian . <p> Defendants : Barbara Kathryn Wilson and seven teen-agers , including Wilson 's four sons . <p> Status : Wilson pleaded guilty to attempted murder , received 30 years TDC . The rest were convicted or pleaded guilty to various charges related to the conspiracy . <p> Baird was the intended victim of a murder-for-hire plot by her daughter and grandsons . She survived after being shot twice in the chest by a 15-year-old " " hit girl . " <p> Prosecutors found no problems in the case against Barbara Wilson , but said a problem with one aspect of the juvenile cases underscored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges are filed . <p> After the indictments , relatives found a bullet and a prescription bottle in Wilson 's trailer . They took them to the Sheriff 's Department , but were turned away . Capt . Candy Henderson of the homicide division said the items were not seen as significant . <p> The evidence was then taken to prosecutors who said it was potentially significant because the juveniles allegedly prepared for the shooting in the trailer . Anything that could connect them to the scene or corroborate witness statements was seen as important . <p> The bottle , for example , bore the name of a relative of one of the juveniles . The woman 's home had been burglarized before the shooting and prosecutors hoped to connect the cases . <p> The .22-caliber bullet was the same caliber as the weapon carried by a 14-year-old boy who accompanied the shooter . <p> Prosecutors hoped to match it to the weapon but had trouble convincing detectives to have it analyzed . <p> In the end , the bullet could not be matched . But it figured in the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his role in the conspiracy . <p> 14-year old juvenile <p> Grand jury summons homicide captain . <p> Shooting victim : A 14-year-old male suspected of breaking into a car . <p> Date : May 16 , 1992 . <p> Place : 13110 Kuykendahl . <p> Defendant : Sheriff 's Deputy I.R . Flores . <p> Status : No-billed . <p> Flores was called to the Kuykendahl apartment complex to investigate the burglary of a car , then found himself confronting the suspects . <p> The four boys drove toward Flores as he yelled at them to stop . As their car struck him , he fired , wounding the victim in the left leg . <p> A grand jury no-billed Flores for the shooting . But it also summoned Capt . Candy Henderson , the head of the homicide division , to chastise her for the inadequate investigation . <p> The panel grilled her about why detectives had not tried to find two suspects who fled , apparently not even asking the two in custody where the others lived . <p> " " The detectives were too quick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) shooting , " said one source close to the investigation . <p> Henderson explains the problem as a paperwork issue : the original burglary of a motor vehicle should have been handled by burglary and theft detectives , she said , while homicide detectives dealt only with the shooting case . But homicide at first got both , without realizing it . <p> She concedes , however , that statements from the missing suspects could have been significant to either case . <p> And on returning to the homicide division from the grand jury , she warned her staff never to put her in that position again . <p> Brewer , James <p> Key witness never interviewed <p> Murder victim : James Brewer . <p> Date : Sept. 8 , 1990 . <p> Place : Highway 90 beside the San Jacinto River . <p> Defendant : Jimmy Don Hailey . <p> Status : Pleaded guilty in exchange for dismissal of a second murder charge ; sentenced to 50 years in prison . <p> Hailey , 20 , was charged with killing two people : Brewer , during a party beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night near a Channelview Taco Bell . <p> Prosecutors and the defense attorney say detectives never interviewed key witnesses in the Brewer case . When defense lawyer Karen Zellars began investigating , she hoped to find witnesses to exonerate her client . Instead , she found one who could surely have convicted him : a woman standing behind Hailey during the shooting . <p> Detectives had not talked to her . <p> Prosecutors said witnesses that detectives did find were not credible , and the gun that killed Brewer was not collected by detectives and was found later in a car belonging to a sheriff 's informant . <p> Because the Brewer case was so weak , prosecutors suggested a plea bargain . They offered to dismiss one case  --  and to let Hailey pick which one  --  if he pleaded guilty to the other . <p> Hoping for leniency , Hailey pleaded guilty to Brewer 's murder because he felt he had violated the law in that case and acted in self-defense in the other . But given the poor investigation and the stiff sentence , Zellars now wishes she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Phantoulath Bouttavong , Khounnorath Konethachank , Sikmor Vohgphakdy and Khampheg Volavong . <p> Date : Sept. 13 , 1992 . <p> Place : The East Freeway access road , south of Beltway 8 <p> Defendants : Tuan " " Tony " Van Ly , Duc Minh Nguyen and Tai Van Ly and a 16-year-old . <p> Status : Suspects arrested , charged with capital murder , trials pending . <p> The victims , members of a Laotian gang , were shot and killed at an abandoned gas station . One survived long enough to give detectives the first name and a description of one of his attackers . The name was mispronounced but helped lead investigators to the suspects . <p> Within two days , three of the suspects , members of another Asian gang , were arrested and charged . By the end of the week , the fourth suspect , a juvenile , was in custody as well . <p> The detectives who worked on the case  --  Bill Taber , Barry Rizk and Ronnie Roberts , with Sgts . Danny Billingsley and John Denholm  --  won unanimous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out several areas as unusually well-handled , including the detectives ' aggressive , quick followup of all available leads . <p> But the lawyers said they were especially impressed with the detectives ' skill in taking Bouttavong 's dying statement , which they called a complicated legal procedure . <p> Nowlin , Karl <p> Victim : Karl Nowlin . <p> Date : April 9 , 1992 . <p> Place : 2300 block of Fir Grove , Kingwood . <p> Defendants : Danny Reagan , Antonio Dooley , Benjamin Clark McCartney and six juveniles . <p> Status : Reagan , convicted of capital murder , given life in prison . Dooley pleaded guilty to murder , sentenced to 45 years . The others received sentences for lesser offenses . <p> Reagan , 18 , was the leader of a band of teen-agers that burst into Nowlin 's home , robbed him of $ 49 , then shot and killed the recovering stroke victim and his dog . <p> The youths , who had practiced their raid beforehand , said they believed they could net at least $ 1,000 by robbing Nowlin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had been raped by Nowlin , who was HIV-positive , and planned the raid partly in revenge . <p> During the raid , the teen-agers quickly overpowered Nowlin and Dooley shot him in the chest . Reagan then shot Nowlin 's pet Shar-Pei and fired again at Nowlin , striking him twice in the head and killing him . <p> Prosecutors involved in the case complimented detectives Ronnie Phillips Sr. and Frank Pratt for various aspects of the investigation , including their handling of Reagan , who confessed to killing Nowlin . <p> They also were said to have done a " " bang-up job " with the scene investigation and with followup that included finding bank transactions where at least one of the defendants had used Nowlin 's bank card .
