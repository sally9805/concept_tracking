Thirty years ago , a suburban housewife tossed out a bombshell of a book that is still changing lives today . Its publication set off a movement that virtually redefined the role of women in society ; ever since , successive waves of fallout have been redefining the role of men and the place of work in all our lives . Her name is Betty Friedan , and her book , The Feminine Mystique , articulated what people were in fact feeling but had n't been able put into words before . Friedan has struck again . This time the subject is age and the way our culture regards both men and women who are growing older . Her new book , The Fountain of Age ( Simon &; Schuster ; 1993 ) , is large and sprawling  --  sort of like life itself . Now a feisty 72 , Friedan argues that , just as women were invisible three decades ago , so are older persons invisible today . American culture is wedded to seeing people over 60 as sick and lonely . Those are the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friedan , and they shape the way we view our lives and our experience of growing older . PT : Do you think that , privately , most people buy into the vision of old people falling apart ? BF : That image is certainly what motivates the dreaded denial of age in our society . When I was researching material for this book , I searched through a month of magazines looking at the images of men and women , and I found almost complete invisibility . There were no images of people clearly over 65 . Then I looked for images of people under age 50 . Again , no image of people doing what it is that people do except as a face of horrible decline . No image of the reality , the vibrance of older people , which I myself thought would be rare when I was first interviewing people for my book . But I found people all over the country who continued growing and developing into their 60s and 70s  --  even into their 90s . PT : What 's wrong with the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BF : What 's wrong is that we have no role models , no guidebooks that affirm or even let us recognize the new strengths emerging in ourselves . After interviewing women and men moving into this new period of life with openness , with change , with vitality  --  people who continue to evolve with wisdom and wholeness  --  I now call it the strength that has no name . We need to affirm those strengths in ourselves and each other . I 'll tell you why we hold on to that debilitating image of age . There have been some interesting studies by a researcher from Harvard named Ellen Langer . She found that if you ask older people and younger people about stereotypes of age  --  old people as sick and lonely  --  the older people themselves and the young people all buy into it a little bit . But they are less likely to buy into the stereotype than those in their middle years  --  in their 40s and 50s  --  who are within striking distance of what our country defines as old , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed anxiety and denial that they hold on to that image . They just do n't like to identify with older people . Even now , there are some publications that do n't want to deal with my book . They say , " We only want to represent the youth look . " And the reason , they feel , is that the only market that has money to buy is the 40-69 range . PT : The media are willing to deal with age only as a problem ? BF : Age with the connotation of someone who 's going to look decrepit . You could put someone vibrant on your cover , someone like me . I 'm 72 . I look vibrant . But I do think we 're on the verge of breaking through this definition of age as leprosy . There 's a great hunger of men and women to break through . People in their 30s and 40s are coming to the book-signings and buying two or three copies , saying , " One is for my mother and one I 'm keeping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as with The Feminine Mystique , " This is changing my life . It 's changing the way I see the rest of my life . " So if my book is hitting a chord , it 's because the time has come to break through this pernicious image . PT : You may sell magazines with your image on the cover . But if you put a garden-variety 65-year-old person on the cover you would n't sell magazines . BF : You might be surprised , my friends . PT : We might be , but that 's the conventional wisdom . BF : And so was the conventional wisdom in 1962 that American women could not identify with anything beyond husband-children-home . You have n't tested it . You only get what you 're seeing . Garbage in , garbage out . We are talking about the fastest-growing group of the population , people over 60 . You 're not affirming their existence , and you should . The trouble is , the models today are anorexic and appealing to pedophiliacs , to child molesters . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No models beyond 30 , beyond 40 , beyond 50 . It 's surprising , but not if you are holding on to that image of old as debilitated . Where are the evolving , adventurous , gutsy kind of people that I interviewed ? I would n't buy a magazine with pictures of dreary , passive people . But that 's not the reality . Look at the reality . PT : How do you define yourself now ? BF : The research shows that people who do continue to grow and develop become more authentically themselves . They become liberated from some of the conflicts and guilts and " shoulds " that paralyzed them in the past . I 've been liberated that way simply by writing this book . There 's something about affirming the totality of yourself , the way you are authentically . I am myself at this age . There 's something about that that 's enormously liberating . You realize you do n't have to live up to some of the things that have haunted you , that have driven you . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can risk yourself in new ways . Now that I 've finished this book I 'm getting ready to go on an Amazon expedition . It depends on the rainy season and the bugs , because I ca n't stand bugs . Then I 'll explore Australia in March . PT : Are others are as lively as you ? The reality is that people are doing new things at this age . I wrote about my doctor  --  an **25;139;TOOLONG I went to when I had a menopause that was no big deal . He 's become a songwriter . In his late 60s he 's started writing songs . He went to a songwriting workshop sponsored by the composers ' organization and he found that he could do it . He 's having a marvelous time . I asked him whether he 's sold any yet . He said , " No , but I will . " You can try things that you did n't try before . In addition , there is a great need to knit together the pieces of your life . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purposes that go beyond yourself . I see that in my own life . You have to keep nurturing these sides . Also with this book and the women 's movement , despite all the conflicts that I 've had , I have been affirming a marvelous opening in life all along  --  and it is n't finished yet . This book . It 's part of the ongoing stream of life and that 's important . PT : Is this the happiest time of your life ? BF : I have a lot of energy . There have been moments of great happiness . But this is a time of being less hemmed in . More free . It 's a very happy time . Once you break through this mystique of age only as decline and you look at it as a new period of human life in its own terms , then everything else is different . Do you love the way you loved when you were 30 or you do n't love at all ? No . Love is still open to new possibilities , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh eyes on what you did n't think you were supposed to be interested in anymore . We need to see that the word old has been so wrongly applied , or youth is so much the existing definition of life that it does n't apply . FROM THE BOOK ... The denial of age carried to its extreme is , finally , the unadulterated horror of second childhood , a vision of ourselves regressing to a childlike state . If we are banished from previous adult roles after sixty-five , and denied the very possibility of future growth or the use of our mature abilities in society , when we can no longer ape youth , we can only regress to second childhood . Consider : * A feature entitled " The Fun Life for Young and Old " in the Boston Globe , offering " a guide to August activities for senior citizens and children "  --  a puppet show , a magic act , etc. * A pharmaceutical ad for the stool softener Doxidon shows a smiling , bifocaled older woman : " Minnie moved her bowels today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor fella gave her Doxidon to take last and it worked ! ... Minnie figures she 's got the smartest doctor in town . " * A newspaper reports that the patients at a nursing home " held their very own Christmas party , " exclaiming , incredulously , that the patients " planned the party , made the invitations , decorated the cookies , and took part in the entertainment . " Why is this " second childhood " image so repulsive ? A Gerontologist has said that it suggests that older people " are losing , or have lost , the very things a growing child gains . It implies a backward movement to earlier developmental stages . " And , of course , the pervasive attempt of older people to emulate or pass for young logically culminates in mockery and denial of our adult personhood and the years of risk , pain , joy and learning that got us there , a denigration of our grown-up selves . When the gerontologist Robert Kastenbaum surveyed a large cross-section of people on the age they " expect to live to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " one out of four wanted to die before their time . In fact , the suicide rate for people over sixty-five has been increasing steadily in America  --  only 11 percent of the population , they account roughly 25 percent of reported suicides . The suicide rate is highest among older white men  --  45.9 per 100,000 aged seventy-five to seventy-nine . seventy-nine . It 's time that we start searching for the Fountain of Age , time that we stop denying our growing older and look at the actuality of our experience and that of other women and men who have gone beyond denial to a new place in their 60s , 70s , and 80s . It 's time to look at age on its own terms , and put names on its values and strengths , breaking through the definition of age solely as deterioration or decline from youth . The problem is how to break through the cocoon of our illusory youth and risk a new stage in life , where there are no prescribed roles , no models , nor rigid rules or visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown of these years of life now open to us and to find our own term for living them .  --  Adapted from The Fountain of Age ( Simon &; Schuster ; 1993 by Betty Friedan . <p>
