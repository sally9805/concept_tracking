Jim Kesselring is not at liberty to reveal the dungeon from which he procured the Mytheral breastplate . And the identity of the monsters he and his party spent 11 hours slaying in order to win the item is likewise proprietary . But he will talk about the auction that his character , a gnome named Razor , held that night in Mithaniel Marr . Roughly 200 players showed up , and the armor sold for 4,000 platinum pieces . But then , turning a socially responsible profit is Razor 's forte . " It 's how I add value to the economy , " he says , " and to the game itself . " <P> So it goes in Everquest , the state of the art in multiplayer , online role-playing games . It 's been clear for decades how enthralled gamers are by such adventures , in which they visit invented universes whose inhabitants create their own stories by exploring territory , making alliances , seeking treasure and so on . But the Net has advanced the form considerably since the halcyon days of Dungeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rec rooms across America on Saturday nights . Today 's fantasy worlds are designed by software gurus , are presented on the Web and swarm with tens of thousands of players . The result is virtual societies like Ultima Online , which in two years amassed 125,000 players so fervent that pieces of exclusive real estate on the Ultima site  --  think of it as the Ultima in-game equivalent of a duplex on Manhattan 's Upper East Side  --  regularly sell on eBay for more than $1,000 . <P> Everquest raises the bar again . Three years in the making at Sony 's 989 Studios in San Diego , it 's the role-playing market 's first 3-D online world , a lush environment reminiscent of immersive shoot-'em-ups like Quake and Doom . The Everquest team , says 989 president Kelly Flock , took a chance by deciding to leap-frog the 2-D Ultima and create a game so graphics-rich it would require a 3-D-accelerated PC in order to play it . <P> Smart move . Everquest launched in March and was an instant hit ; after only two months , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay an $8 or $9 monthly subscription rate . Each night 30,000 people fill the cities , deserts and forests that constitute the 19 Everquest zones . <P> Yes , worried parents , there 's violence in Everquest . But the game 's best post-Columbine feature is its marginalization of slaughter . In sharp contrast to Ultima , in which veteran players often murder " newbies " just for the thrill of it , Everquest , says producer Brad McQuaid , lets users choose whether or not to be " player killers " ; only those who do can kill  --  or be killed by  --  others . Thus far only 15% have opted for killer status . <P> Instead , Everquest thrives on the relationships that develop among players , who talk via chat windows in one of the languages spoken by the game 's 12 races ( elf , gnome , human , etc . ) . Players attend concerts , auctions and weddings ; bicker over everything from wolf meat to scimitars ; and pool talents and resources to quest for distant treasures . " Stuff like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting your friend with a rocket launcher. "
