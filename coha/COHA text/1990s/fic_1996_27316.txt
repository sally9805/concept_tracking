My sharpest memory is of a single instant surrounded by dark . I was seven , and our family doctor knelt before me where I sat on a mattress on the bare floor . He wore a yellow golf shirt unbuttoned so that sprouts of hair showed in a V shape on his chest . I had never seen him in anything but a white starched shirt and a gray tie . The change unnerved me . He was pulling at the hem of my favorite nightgown-a pattern of Texas bluebonnets bunched into nosegays tied with ribbon against a field of nappy white cotton . I had tucked my knees under it to make a tent . He could easily have yanked the thing over my head with one motion , but something made him gentle . " Show me the marks , " he said . " Come on , now . I wo n't hurt you . " He had watery blue eyes behind thick glasses , and a mustache that looked like a caterpillar . " Please ? Just pull this up and show me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of hem between thumb and forefinger . I was n't crying and do n't remember any pain , but he talked to me in that begging voice he used when he had a long needle hidden behind his back . I liked him but did n't much trust him . The room I shared with my sister was dark , but I did n't fancy hiking my gown up with strangers milling around in the living room . It took three decades for that instant to unfreeze . Neighbors and family helped me turn that one bright slide into a panorama . The bed frame tilted against the wall behind the doctor had a scary , spidery look in the dark . In one corner , the tallboy was tipped over on its back like a stranded turtle , its drawers flung around . There were heaps of spilled clothes , puzzles , comics , and the GoldenBooks I could count on my mom to buy in the supermarket line if I 'd stayed in the carriage . The doorway framed the enormous backlit form of Sheriff Watson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stout arm . She had her pink pajamas on and her legs wrapped around his waist . She fiddled with his badge with a concentration too intense for the actual interest such a thing might hold for her . Even at that age she was cynical about authority in any form . She was known for mocking nuns in public and sassing teachers . But I could see that she had painted a deferential look on her face . The sheriffhmp1.5 's cowboy hat kept the details of his expression in deep shadow , but I made out a sort of soft half-smile I 'd never seen on him . I had a knee-jerk fear of the sheriff based on my father 's tendency to get in fights . He 'd pull open the back screen with knuckles scraped and bleeding , then squat down to give instructions to me and Lecia ( pronounced , she would have me tell you , " Lisa " ) . " If the sheriff comes by here , you just tell him you ai n't seen me in a few days . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to straight-faced lie to the law was never tested . But just his presence that night flooded me with an odd sense : I done something wrong and here 's the sheriff . If I had , that night , possessed a voice , or if anyone nearby felt like listening , that 's what I might have said . But when you 're a kid and something big is going on , you might as well be furniture for all anybody says to you . It was only over time that the panorama became animate , like a scene in some movie crystal ball that whirls from a foggy blur into focus . People developed little distinct motions ; then the whole scene jerked to smooth and sudden life . Sheriff Watson 's jaw dipped into the light and returned to shadow with some regularity as he said things that I could n't hear to my blond , suddenly cherubic-acting sister . Some firemen wearing canary-colored slickers started to move through the next room , and Dr. Boudreaux 's thick fingers came again to rub the edge of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard goods . There must have been an ambulance outside , because at intervals big triangles of red light slashed across the room . I could almost feel them moving over my face , and in the window , through a web of honeysuckle , I saw in my own backyard flames like those of a football bonfire . And the volume on the night began to rise . People with heavy boots stomped through the house . Somebody turned off the ambulance siren . The back screen opened and slammed . My daddy 's dog , Nipper , was growling low and making his chain clank in the yard . He was a sullen dog trained to drink beer and bite strangers . He 'd been known to leap from a speeding truck 's window to chase down and fight any hound he saw . He 'd killed one lady 's Chihuahua , then just shook it like a rag while Daddy tried to coax him out of her garage and she hollered and cried . When a voice I did n't know told some sonofabitch to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared that night into the East Texas bayou-or more likely , my sister later figured out , the gas chamber at the local pound . Anyway , we never saw him again , which was okay by me . That dog had bitten me more than once . More door slams , the noise of boots , and some radio static from the cruiser in the road . " Come on , baby , " Dr. Boudreaux said , " show me the marks . I 'm not about to hurt you . " I kept waiting to make eye contact with my sister to get some idea of how to handle this , but she was dead set on that badge . I do n't remember talking . I must eventually have told Dr. Boudreaux there were n't any marks on me . There were n't . It took a long time for me to figure that out for certain , even longer to drive my memory from that single place in time out toward the rest of my life . The next thing I knew , I was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had decided to pretend that she was asleep . My eyes were belt-level with his service revolver and a small leather sap that even then must have been illegal in the state of Texas . It was shaped like an enormous black tear . I resisted the urge to touch it . Lecia kept her face in his neck the whole time , but I knew she was scudging sleep . She slept like a cat , and this was plenty of hoopla to keep her awake . The sheriff held my left hand . With my free one , I reached up and pinched her dirty ankle . Hard . She kicked out at me , then angled her foot up out of reach and snuggled back to her fake sleep on his chest . The highway patrolmen and firemen stood around with the blank heaviness of uninvited visitors who plan a long stay . Somebody had made a pot of coffee that laid a nutty smell over the faint chemical stink from the gasoline fire in the backyard . The men in the living room gave our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that neither of my parents was coming . Daddy was working the graveyard shift , and the sheriff said that his deputy had driven out to the plant to try and track him down . Mother had been taken Away-he further told us-for being Nervous . I should explain here that in East Texas parlance the term Nervous applied with equal accuracy to anything from chronic nail-biting to full-blown psychosis . Mr. Thibideaux down the street had blown off the heads of his wife and three sons , then set his house on fire before fixing the shotgun barrel under his own jaw and using his big toe on the trigger . I used to spend Saturday nights in that house with his daughter , a junior high twirler of some popularity , and I remember nothing more of Mr. Thibideaux than that he had a crew cut and a stern manner . He was a refinery worker like Daddy , and also a deacon at First Baptist . I was in my twenties when Mr. Thibideaux killed his family . I liked to call myself a poet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation , of course-I was a lazy student ) . I would ride the Greyhound for thirty-six hours down from the Midwest to Leechfield , then spend days dressed in black in the scalding heat of my mother 's front porch reading Homer ( or Ovid or Virgil ) and waiting for someone to ask me what I was reading . No one ever did . People asked me what I was drinking , how much I weighed , where I was living , and if I had married yet , but no one gave me a chance to deliver my lecture on Great Literature . It was during one of these visits that I found the Thibideauxs ' burned-out house , and also stumbled on the Greek term ate . In ancient epics , when somebody boffs a girl or slays somebody or just generally gets heated up , he can usually blame ate , a kind of raging passion , pseudodemonic , that banishes reason . So Agamemnon , having robbed Achilles of his girlfriend , said , " I was blinded by ate and Zeus took away my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's ensorcered in some way . Because the ate is supernatural , it releases the person possessed of it from any guilt for her actions . When neighbors tried to explain the whole murder-suicide of the Thibideaux clan after thirty years of grass-cutting and garbage-taking-out and dutiful church-service attendance , they did so with one adjective , which I have since traced to the Homeric idea of ate : Mr. Thibideaux was Nervous . No amount of prodding on my part produced a more elaborate explanation . On the night the sheriff came to our house and Mother was adjudged more or less permanently Nervous , I did n't yet understand the word . I had only a vague tight panic in the pit of my stomach , the one you get when your parents are nowhere in sight and probably do n't even know who has a hold of you or where you 'll wind up spending the night . I could hear the low hum of neighbor women talking as we got near the front door . They had gathered on the far side of the ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their nightclothes like some off-duty SWAT team waiting for orders . The sheriff let go of my hand once we were outside . From inside the tall shadow of his hat , with my sister still wrapped around him in bogus slumber , he told me to wait on the top step while he talked to the ladies . Then he went up to the women , setting in motion a series of robe-tightenings and sweater- buttonings . The concrete was cold on my bottom through the thin nightgown . I plucked two june bugs off the screen and tried to line them up to race down a brick , but one flew off , and the other just flipped over and waggled its legs in the air . At some point it dawned on me that my fate for the night was being decided by Sheriff Watson and the neighbor ladies . It was my habit at that time to bargain with God , so I imagine that I started some haggling prayer about who might take us home . Do n't let it be the Smothergills , I probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules about who ate what and when . The one time we 'd spent the night there , Lecia and I wound up in the bathroom eating toothpaste past midnight . We 'd eaten a whole tube , for which we had been switch-whipped in the morning by a gray-faced Mr. Smothergill . He was undergoing weekly chemotherapy treatments for mouth cancer at the time , and every kid in the neighborhood had an opinion about when he would die . Cancer and death were synonymous . His sandpaper voice and bleak disposition scared us more than any whipping . His kids called him Cheerful Chuck behind his back . The oldest Smothergill daughter had been permitted to visit my house only once . ( Our house was perceived as Dangerous , a consequence of Mother 's being Nervous . ) She was so tickled by the idea that we could open the refrigerator at will that she melted down a whole stick of butter in a skillet and drank it from a coffee mug . Lord , I would rather eat a bug than sleep on that hard pallet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up and stand around the TV in their underpants doing armpit farts . Let it be the Dillards ' , and I 'll lead a holy life forever from this day . I will not spit or scratch or pinch or try to get Babby Carter to eat doo-doo . Mrs. Dillard stood with the other ladies in her pale blue zip-front duster , her arms folded across her chest . She made Pillsbury cinnamon rolls in the morning and let me squiggle on the icing . Plus her boys had to wear pajama pants when we were there . But the Dillards had space for only one of us , and that on the scratchy living room sofa . Maybe Lecia could go to the Smothergills ' , I proposed to whatever God I worshiped , and I could take the Dillards . I wished Lecia no particular harm , but if there was only one banana left in the bowl , I would not hesitate to grab it and leave her to do without . I decided that if the june bug could be herded the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I wanted . But the june bug kept flipping and waggling before it had even gone an inch , and Mrs. Dillard went out of her way , it seemed , not to look at me . I do n't remember who we got farmed out to or for how long . I was later told that we 'd stayed for a time with a childless couple who bred birds . Some memory endures of a screened-in breezeway with green slatted blinds all around . The light was lemon-colored and dusty , the air filled with blue-and-green parakeets , whose crazy orbits put me in mind of that Alfred Hitchcock movie where birds go nuts and start pecking out people 's eyeballs . But the faces of my hosts in that place-no matter how hard I squint-refuse to be conjured . Because it took so long for me to paste together what happened , I will leave that part of the story missing for a while . It went long unformed for me , and I want to keep it that way here . I do n't mean to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often just blanks it out . But some ghost of an event may stay in your head . Then , like the smudge of a bad word quickly wiped off a school blackboard , this ghost can call undue attention to itself by its very vagueness . You keep studying the dim shape of it , as if the original form will magically emerge . This blank spot in my past , then , spoke most loudly to me by being blank . It was a hole in my life that I both feared and kept coming back to because I could n't quite fill it in . I did know from that night forward that things in my house were Not Right , this despite the fact that the events I have described so far had few outward results . No one ever mentioned the night again . I do n't remember any subsequent home visits from any kind of social worker or concerned neighbor . Dr. Bouchdreaux seemed sometimes to minister to my health with an uncharacteristic tenderness . And neighbors dragged my sister and me to catechism classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never mentioning the fact that our family never reciprocated . I frequently showed up on doorsteps at suppertime ; foraging , Daddy called it . He said it reminded him of his rail- riding days during the Depression . But no one ever failed to hand me a plate , though everybody knew that I had plenty to eat at home , which was n't always true for the families I popped in on . The night 's major consequences for me were internal . The fact that my house was Not Right metastasized into the notion that I myself was somehow Not Right , or that my survival in the world depended on my constant vigilance against various forms of Not-Rightness . Whenever I stepped into the road at Leechfield 's one traffic light , I usually expected to get plowed down by a Red Ball truck flying out of nowhere ( unlikely , given the lack of traffic ) . I became both a flincher and a fighter . I was quick to burst into tears in the middle of a sandlot baseball game and equally quick to whack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has it that I once cold-cocked a five-year-old playmate with an army trench shovel , then calmly went back to digging . Some of this explosiveness just came from a naturally bad temperament , of course . But some stems from that night , when my mind simply erased everything up until Dr. Boudreaux began inviting me to show him marks that I now know were n't even there . The missing story really starts before I was born , when my mother and father met and , for reasons I still do n't get , quickly married . My mother had just arrived in Leechfield . She 'd driven down from New York with an Italian sea captain named Paolo . He was fifty to her thirty , and her fourth husband . My mother did n't date , she married . At least that 's what we said when I finally found out about all her marriages before Daddy . She racked up seven weddings in all , two to my father . My mother tended to blame the early marriages on her own mother 's strict Methodist values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which she was fond . She and Paolo had barely finished the honeymoon and set up housekeeping in Leechfield , where he was fixing to ship out , than they began fighting . So it was on a wet winter evening in 1950 that she threw her dresses , books , and hatboxes in the back of an old Ford and laid rubber out of Leechfield , intending never to return . She was heading for her mother 's cotton farm about five hundred miles west . Just outside of Leechfield , where Highway 73 yields up its jagged refinery skyline to bayous and rice fields , she blew a tire . She was about twenty yards from the truck stop where Daddy happened to be working . He had a union job as an apprentice stillman at Gulf Oil , but he was filling in at the station that night for his friend Cooter , who 'd called him in desperation from a crap game in Baton Rouge where he was allegedly on a roll . All Mother 's marriages , once I uncovered them in my twenties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was maybe the most unlikely . Had Cooter not gotten lucky with the dice in a Baton Rouge honky-tonk , and had Paolo not perturbed Mother in the process of unpacking crates , and had the tire on the Ford not been worn from a recent cross-country jaunt ( Paolo 's mother lived in Seattle , and they 'd traveled there from New York , then down to Texas , where divorce laws permitted Mother to quickly get rid of husband number three before signing up with number four ) . . . . All these events conspired to strand my mother quite literally at my father 's feet on Highway 73 that night . He said there was a General Electric moon shining the first time he saw her , so bright it was like a spotlight on her . She refused his help jacking up the car and proceeded to cuss like a sailor when she could n't get the lug nuts loose . My mother claims that she had only recently learned to cuss , from Paolo . Daddy said her string of practiced invectives , which seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beige silk suit ) and New York license plates , impressed him no end . He 'd never heard a woman cuss like that before . She changed the tire and must have made some note of his raw good looks . He was some part Indian-we never figured out which tribe-black-haired and sharp- featured . His jug-eared grin reminded her of Clark Gable 's . Since she fancied herself a sort of Bohemian Scarlett O'Hara , the attraction was deep and sudden . I should also note that Mother was prone to conversion experiences of various kinds , and had entered a fervent Marxist stage . She toted Das Kapital around in her purse for years . Daddy was active in the Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers Union . Whenever they renegotiated a contract-every two years-he was known as an able picket-line brawler . He was , in short , a Texas working man , with a smattering of Indian blood and with personality traits that she had begun to consider heroic .                  @ @ @
