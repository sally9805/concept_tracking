<p> Before the electrodes , Jeff was a mess . <p> " I could n't focus through an entire business meeting , " says the 40-year-old , who requested anonymity . After 30 minutes , he would inevitably space out and lose concentration . <p> A few years ago , Jeff might have seen a psychiatrist . Instead , he plays video games . <p> Sitting placidly before a personal computer , Jeff flies a simulated airplane without touching a keyboard or joystick . The only energy that keeps the plane from crashing comes through an electrode going from the top of his head to the computer . The electrode is known as a clinical grade electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , the same spidery set of wires and electrodes hospitals use to find brain tumors . <p> If Jeff 's brain produces the correct level of beta waves , which are produced during intense concentration , the plane keeps flying . Theta waves , associated with daydreaming , send him careening into the stratosphere . <p> The result should be a more relaxed , attentive Jeff , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south Denver . <p> " In a conscious state , the neurons in the brain fire quickly . But in Attention Deficit Disorder ( patients ) , their brain slows down when it should be most active . In other words , they 're going into a daydreaming theta state instead of the intense beta state , " he says . <p> Hoffman 's work is based on 20 years of research that has gone from being ridiculed by the medical community to being covered by half of all insurance companies . He charges less than some social workers - $ 100 an hour for 40 hour-long sessions . <p> Today about 350 organizations provide neurotherapy in the United States . Their work is put under the scrutiny of insurance companies , academics and three professional associations . About a dozen neurofeedback providers practice in Colorado , Hoffman says . <p> After the 20th session , Jeff says he can feel the progress . " You know when you 're learning . I feel like I 'm in a certain state of mind when it happens . I 'm in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the only one to use those words . For the past two years , Colorado Springs therapist Richard Patton has been rocking the boat of conventional neurotherapy by making extraordinary claims . <p> Reaching potential <p> Using the same equipment as Hoffman , Patton says he can help teams of negotiators , engineers and athletes train their brains to achieve " peak performance . " For a fee of $ 6,000 for 20 hour-long sessions , or $ 300 an hour , Patton says he can teach anyone how to throw like John Elway . <p> " If you ask John Elway what it was like ( to throw a football ) , he says ' well you know , it just happened ! ' Something very specific happened , " Patton says . By recreating that ' something , ' Elway can make another successful throw , according to Patton , whose therapy gives people the " ability to recognize and create at will that specific state of mind . " <p> Patton 's work is so new that some neurofeedback researchers have n't even heard of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brain waves are fed into a PC and interpreted by a program called BrainLink created by his company , Advanced Neurotechnologies Inc . <p> Depending on the desired mind state , Patton feeds the computer a " protocol , " which is like the road map the subject follows to achieve enlightenment . The computer filters the client 's brain waves through the protocol and tells her how close she is to the protocol through musical tones that rise as she gets closer . <p> " It 's not a state of bliss , although it can be pleasant . It 's like beginning to become aware of your thoughts so that you can make changes in them , " Patton says . <p> Through his protocols , the therapist claims to have helped an 18-year-old become a two-time national Karate champion , a beginning kayaker brave expert waters , and a telecommunications manager perform under stress . <p> " It 's almost like I can feel a physical shift in my mind , just like you do when you shift a car . I can feel one thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points that I can hear the feedback , " one client told the U.S. Information Agency , which was researching Patton 's claims for the U.S. government . <p> But do n't expect to be able to learn anything from ANI about BrainLink without a price . Other neurotherapists have tried and were told to look elsewhere . <p> Cloak and dagger <p> Hoffman and Patton are members of the 3-year-old National Registry of Neurofeedback Providers . When Hoffman heard about one of Patton 's client 's who had overcome chronic fatigue using one of Patton 's protocols , he saw a chance to help his own patient who had the same problem . <p> " I called and asked ( the client ) what her protocol was , and she told me it was proprietary . It made me nauseous , " Hoffman says . <p> The protocols are so secret that clients have to sign a legally binding non-disclosure agreement before undergoing treatment . If they let out even a peep , " It 's a horrible legal mess , " Patton says . " The hounds of hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to any potential competitors . " <p> That 's because Patton sees neurotherapy as a lucrative business that 's only bound to grow . He says he already has been approached by several " huge " companies and defense contractors to make brain-wave products . Eventually , he thinks it will be possible for people to " type " into a computer without using their fingers . <p> " Would you ask Bill Gates to give up his source code for ( Microsoft ) Windows ? Can you imagine trying to talk to him into that 20 years ago ? There 's a whole industry here , " Patton says . <p> Experts in the field beg to differ . Hoffman says the registry may change its bylaws to make the ownership of protocols a cause for removal . And University of Tennessee professor Joel Lubar , president of the Academy of Certified Neurotherapists and the pioneer of using neurotherapy to treat ADD , says there are n't enough studies to prove that neurotherapy can improve performance . That makes ANI 's rates , which are three-fold of most neurotherapists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My personal opinion is that nobody should be charging anything for improving normal performance at this stage . It 's still too experimental Respectable scientists who see these claims will write detractors calling him a charlatan , and that impedes a possibly promising approach . " <p> Lubar says Patton 's theory is plausible , if not yet demonstrated , and Lubar is doing his own research into the realm on college students . Hoffman is also hopeful . <p> " I think there 's little doubt that we 're going to see an increase in peak performance due to neurofeedback in the future , " Hoffman says . " I do n't know if it 's safe yet to say that a brain can become supernormal . " <p> The ability of the neuron to learn is already well-documented , Hoffman says . <p> In one study , by hooking archers up to EEG machines , scientists showed that athletes ' brains produced a burst of alpha waves when they released the arrow . When that " protocol " was taught to other archers , their bull's-eye scores went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar studies on golfers that isolated winning ratios of theta , alpha and beta waves . <p> " I know what the ratios are for sinking putts . And if you do n't make those ratios , you 're not going to be sinking putts , " he says . <p> Daniel Landers , a psychology professor at Arizona State University in Tempe , says that 's unreasonable . Landers published the brain patterns for putting golfers two years ago after years of research . His conclusion is that golf is too complex for neurotherapy . <p> Never mind the controversy . Patton is preparing to apply neuroscience to other commercial uses in an entire line of brainy products . <p> He points to studies done on rabbits , research that identified distinct brain-wave patterns when the animals sniffed different vegetables . The patterns were the same in every rabbit , which means human thoughts could have their own wave signatures . <p> Sound like reading minds ? <p> Patton says that 's the next frontier . <p> " In humans , it 's probably much more feasible to recognize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single thought - but it has many commercial applications , " Patton says . <p> Those applications are also trade secrets , and they 're still a ways down the road , he says . In the meantime , Patton says he 'll continue to provide his service . <p> " Performance is not some end state where we arrive at and say , hey , here we are in Orange County , " he says . " You do n't just arrive anywhere . We can always perform better . There 's always another goal , there 's always another plateau to hit . There 's always another mountain to conquer . "
