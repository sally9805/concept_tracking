<p> Governor Pete Wilson signed California 's $ 67 billion budget yesterday after making good on his threat to veto selected education funding until lawmakers agree to his plan for a statewide test of students ' reading and math skills . <p> Democratic legislators likened the removal of nearly $ 203 million intended for school projects to extortion and " hostage " taking , signaling that a rocky resolution of the statewide testing issue is ahead when the lawmakers return to the Capitol next week . <p> " He 's holding school programs hostage , which is really holding kids hostage , so he can have his way on what 's basically a stupid idea , " said Senator John Burton , D-San Francisco . <p> " It ill behooves the governor of the great state of California to act in a such a petty manner . " <p> Wilson promised some selective vetoes last week after the Legislature refused to agree to finance his plan for statewide school testing . Democrats objected to several parts of Wilson 's proposal , among them his insistence that the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree over what role schools chief Delaine Eastin , a Wilson critic , should have in the selection of a test . <p> " The purpose ( of the vetoes ) , as was well understood , was to secure the votes we need ( to approve the test ) , " the governor said , emphasizing that he will restore the cuts if he gets his way . <p> By signing the overall budget  --  one week after lawmakers passed it  --  the Republican governor allows thousands of overdue checks to flow to people and businesses who provide services to the state . Those businesses have received no money since July 1 , the day a budget was supposed to be in place . <p> Wilson signed the budget privately , but he staged a media event at an elementary school in Elk Grove in Sacramento County . He touted his signing of a bill to increase money for districts to reduce class size from 30 to 20 students  --  one of the most popular education initiatives undertaken by the state . <p> In a speech apparently intended more for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the auditorium of John Ehrhardt Elementary School , Wilson acknowledged that the budget was " tardy " but said that , for schools , it was worth the wait . <p> " Education can and should be a wonderful investment , or it can be an expensive failure , " Wilson said . <p> $ 22 BILLION TO SCHOOLS <p> Kindergarten through 12th- grade public schools are by far the biggest winners in the spending plan , receiving $ 22 billion in aid , including some $ 1.5 billion to reduce class sizes in kindergarten through third grade . <p> An additional $ 100 million is earmarked for bringing more computers into classrooms . Wilson plans to sign that bill today at a ceremony in Silicon Valley . <p> It is not , however , a good year to be poor . <p> Not counting the $ 203 million in education spending that he " set aside , " Wilson eliminated $ 111 million from the budget , including a program to provide prenatal care to illegal immigrants whose children become U.S. citizens at birth . The program ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wilson said when asked by reporters about the veto . " While we prize prenatal care  --  there is no question about its value  --  the question is whether the state of California should be doing something that is now illegal under the federal welfare reform law . " <p> IMMIGRANTS , DISABLED LOSE FUNDS <p> Wilson also cut $ 17 million in cash grants to legal immigrants no longer eligible for aid under the federal Supplemental Security Income program . <p> An additional $ 8 million for low-income disabled children was cut . Some of the children have been cut off from federal aid under the same program because of restricted eligibility rules contained in the new welfare reform law . <p> " Not taking care of developmentally disabled kids is outrageous  --  particularly when he has the money to do it , " grumbled Burton . " It 's inhumane . " <p> Some $ 30 million for various health care programs for the poor was also eliminated by the governor . <p> The budget does contain $ 100 million for local law enforcement agencies and $ 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seniors who are cut off from federal assistance because of changes in welfare laws . <p> Lawmakers reacted most angrily to Wilson 's elimination of $ 203 million in funding , most of it for schools , which Wilson said he would restore if the Legislature backs his plan to offer a uniform reading and math test to students in the second to 11th grade . <p> " I find it ironic that at the very moment the governor is cheerfully taking the credit for his class- size-reduction efforts , he still has no qualms about holding our schoolchildren hostage by cutting $ 200 million in funding for many other programs which benefit kids , " said Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer , D-Hayward , in a statement . <p> ' BRINKMANSHIP AND THREATS ' <p> " The governor 's increasing reliance on brinkmanship and threats is unnecessary and counterproductive , " Lockyer added . <p> Nearly three-fourths of the $ 203 million is a cost-of-living increase for what are known as categorical programs , such as buses and desegregation . Wilson said that money will be given back if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants . <p> Also among the funding held aside was $ 1.5 million for Indian Education Centers , $ 1 million for playground safety grants and $ 2.3 million for school libraries . <p> Much of the rest of the education money in jeopardy is what some lawmakers call " district enhancements . " <p> Translated , they are pork-barrel projects in individual legislator 's districts , such as $ 250,000 for the Napa Valley Unified School District for technology purchases , $ 395,000 for the Lompoc Unified School District , and so on . <p> " In his so-called set-asides , ( Wilson ) has targeted legislators in competitive districts , Democrats in general , urban Democrats and the poor , " said Assemblywoman Carole Migden , D-San Francisco . " It 's hardly a subtle stroke . To characterize our interest as overly wed to district projects is an insult and unfounded . " <p> WILSON 'S BUDGET CUTS <p> . <p> Governor Pete Wilson cut $ 314 million in spending from the state 's $ 67 billion budget he signed yesterday , but he said he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public schools  --  if lawmakers accept his plan to create one statewide test to gauge student performance in Grades 2 to 11 . <p> The remaining $ 111 million in cuts are permanent . Those include : <p> . <p> * Prenatal care  --  $ 1.7 million to provide prenatal care to pregnant illegal aliens , whose children become U.S. citizens when born . The program ends October 1 . <p> * Health care  --  $ 30 million for increasing services at rural health clinics , the state 's indigent health- care program and primary-care clinics . <p> * Legal immigrants  --  $ 17 million for state cash grants to legal immigrants not eligible for payments under the federal Supplemental Security Income program . <p> * Disabled children  --  $ 8 million to create a state program for low- income , disabled children no longer eligible for payments under the Supplemental Security Income program . <p> * California State University  --  $ 2.5 million to create a plan for increasing the use of technology . <p> * Community colleges  --  $ 23.8 million to defray costs of student health fees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cemeteries  --  $ 1.5 million to defray Los Angeles ' costs when the city takes over the Verdugo Hills of Peace Cemetery . <p> * Trains  --  $ 2.1 million to add a fifth and sixth train on the Capitol Corridor and extend service between Sacramento and Stockton . <p> * Swimming pool  --  $ 250,000 for the Martin Luther King Jr . Community Center Pool in San Francisco . <p> * Parks  --  $ 500,000 toward the $ 3 million cost of buying Esprit Park in San Francisco .
