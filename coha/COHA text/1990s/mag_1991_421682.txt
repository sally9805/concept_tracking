Section : MUTUAL FUNDS <p> THE THREE FUND FAMILIES YOU 'RE about to meet have no famous money managers to brag about , and the companies themselves are a long way from being household names . But few other groups can match their record for consistently superior performance . All three of AIM Management 's equity funds are among the top five in their categories over the five years that ended May 1 . Of Founders Asset Management 's five funds with three year records , three landed in the top 10 in their categories for the period , while the group 's two younger funds , Discovery and Worldwide Growth , captured the No. 1 and No. 2 spots in their sectors for the past 12 months . And three of Phoenix Investment 's six stock funds with 10-year records ranked in the top 25 of all funds for the past 10 years . <p> As with any equity investment , though , you should not put money into any of these families ' funds unless you are prepared for some ups and downs . All three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks with fast-growing earnings  --  and their record will be tough to sustain when the investment cycle turns against growth stocks , as it inevitably will from time to time . Still , for patient investors , these are families to marry into for richer , not for poorer . 1 AVOIDING THE COCKROACHES AT PHOENIX <p> Family life revolves around teamwork at Phoenix Investment Counsel , a 15-year-old subsidiary of the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co. and , at $3.3 billion in total equity assets , the largest of our three families . " Each fund is autonomous , " explains Patricia Bannan , 29 , manager of the $650 million Phoenix Balanced Fund , " but we work out our ideas together . " Every team needs a coach , however , and the undisputed Tommy Lasorda of Phoenix is Robert Chesek , 56 . Chesek has managed $935 million Phoenix Growth for the past 10 years ( currently he shares responsibility for the fund with Cathy Dudley , 31 ) and he has also co-managed three of the group 's five other equity funds at one time or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skippers started out as Chesek 's co-pilots . <p> Stock picking at the 4.75%-load group starts with an analysis of the economy . " We try to identify trends , good or bad , " says Chesek , " and then look for sectors that will benefit from them . " Once they identify promising industries  --  lately they 've been hot on health care and construction  --  Phoenix managers then focus on stocks with annual rates of earnings growth at least as high as their price/earnings multiples and significantly above the five-year growth rate of the S &P; 500 ( recently 7% a year ) . To minimize risk , Phoenix managers never hesitate to dump a stock when earnings fall short of expectations . " Earnings disappointments are like cockroaches , " says Bannan . " You never see just one . " <p> The results speak for themselves . Two of the family 's three original funds  --  Balanced and Stock , a $124 million aggressive growth fund managed since last year by Michael Matty , 28  --  delivered a total return of more than 360% for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average stock fund . The other , Chesek 's Growth Fund , topped 500% for the same period . And for the most recent 12 months , $33 million Total Return , a 10-year-old growth and income fund managed since 1989 by Robert Milnamow , 40 , netted a 22% return , half again as much as the average fund in its category . ( Yet another successful sibling , Phoenix Convertible , up 8.1% for the four months to May 1 , is the subject of Fund Focus on page 53 . ) <p> The group 's hottest selection right now , however , is 18-month-old Multi : Capital Appreciation , also managed by Chesek and Dudley . The $50 million growth fund has ridden the sizzling small-company sector to a 46% gain for the past 12 months , compared with a 16.9% return for the average fund in its category . <p> Despite late April 's half-point cut in the Federal Reserve 's discount rate , the current mood at Phoenix is cautious . " The market is n't frothy yet , " says Chesek , " but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors are turning speculative makes us less optimistic than we were last fall . " If a still sluggish economy spoils the rally sometime this summer , Balanced  --  with its 40% in high-quality bonds  --  is likely to hold its value better than other Phoenix funds . On the other hand , Multi : Capital Appreciation 's current focus on flighty small-company stocks makes it the most vulnerable to a market downturn , though it might bounce back the fastest . 2 A FAMILY GROWS IN DENVER <p> The 16-year-old Denver firm of Founders Asset Management , the only no-load of our three , has big plans . " We 're trying to become a fully diversified fund family , building block by block , " says Bjorn Borgen , 53 , Founders ' Norwegian-born president . With help from some Rocky Mountain-high gains , assets doubled during the past five years to $800 million , and the family 's equity portfolio has grown from four to seven funds . <p> Teamwork is as strong an imperative at Founders as at Phoenix . Led by Borgen , Founders ' four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.m. to share any new information on the 750 stocks that they follow . From that master list , each fund 's lead manager , closely advised by the entire team , selects stocks for the fund 's portfolio . For example , Michael Haines , 29 , picks fast-growing small-company stocks with market values between $25 million and $150 million for the the 72-stock portfolio of $18.2 million Discovery . Jay Tracey , 37 , chooses established companies with consistent earnings and strong dividend growth for 44-stock Blue Chip . As at Phoenix , Founders ' managers are quick to jettison stocks when earnings disappoint or if the overall market turns Sour . After the invasion of Kuwait last August , for example , the firm raised Discovery 's cash levels from less than 5% to more than 40% . <p> The strategy has paid off well . The $9 million Worldwide Growth fund was the No. 2 global fund for the 12 months to May 1 , with a 15.3% gain . Special , a $120.1 million maximum-capital-gains fund , rose 26.8% in the period , nearly twice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with 16% for the average small-stock fund . Discovery 's slightly more sedate stablemate , $80.1 million Frontier , rose 19.2% . <p> Founders ' managers now see the Dow Jones industrial average breaking through 4000 by the fall of 1993 . They expect , however , that the advance will be interrupted by a setback of 10% or so , perhaps as early as this summer . In that scenario , the best-performing Founders equity fund over the next few months is likely to be the $262 million growth and income fund , Founders Blue Chip , up 63.7% over the past three years . Once the bull market resumes , the funds most likely to soar are the group 's sizzling but volatile small-stockers , Frontier and Discovery . Best tactic : dollar-cost average into these two-that is , put in fixed amounts at regular intervals , thereby lowering your average cost per share . 3 ADOPTED FUNDS MAKE GOOD AT AIM <p> AIM is the opposite of the close-knit , home-grown Phoenix and Founders families . All of its 5.5%-load equity funds started as independent funds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston-based AIM in 1986 . They are n't even managed in the same part of the country : Weingarry , the group 's $1.5 billion growth fund , and Constellation , its $223 million maximum-capital-gains fund , operate out of New York City , while Charter , a $160 million growth and income fund , is guided from Dallas . <p> In the group 's New York branch , former economist and statistician Harry Hutzler , 67  --  assisted since 1987 by co-manager and heir apparent Jonathan Schoolar , 30  --  still follow the rigorous growth-stock approach that Hutzler developed for Weingarten in 1969 and applied to Constellation at its launch in 1976 . The two managers split both portfolios into two main sections . The first includes only the cream of the growth-stock universe : companies like Wal-Mart and Merck , which have grown consistently at more than 15% a year . The other section is devoted to companies in almost any business that report quarterly earnings at least 15% to 25% above analysts ' estimates . ( The difference between the two funds : 100-stock Weingarten focuses on blue-chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have market values of less than $1 billion . ) As a result , for a few weeks each quarter Hutzler 's three-person Madison Avenue office goes into overdrive . " During peak earnings-report periods , " says Hutzler , " I easily make 100 phone calls a day . " <p> The 37-stock Charter Fund , managed since 1968 by Julian Lerner , 66 , takes a more eclectic approach . " I 'm the conservative investor at AIM , " says Lerner . " I made every mistake in the book getting to the strategy I have now . " Like Hutzler and Schoolar , Lerner looks primarily for better-than-expected earnings . But he also prefers solidly financed companies that have paid a rising dividend over each of the past five years . <p> That conservative rule helped Charter return an annualized 21.8% over the past three years , compared with 13.5% for the average equity fund . It also makes Charter perhaps the safest AIM fund at today 's high stock market values . Weingarten , up an annualized 21.6% over the same period , remains a solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20.2% , with caution . Despite the fund 's strong three-year record , it carries the same risks as its counterparts at Founders and Phoenix , including a high concentration of stocks in risky high-tech medical and computer software stocks . For all but the steely nerved , this is one fund that may be simply too hot to handle . WHERE TOP PERFORMANCE RUNS IN THE FAMILY <p> These funds rank among the top in their categories over at least one of the periods included in the table . Overall , the Phoenix group boasts the best 10-year record of the three families , while AIM is the standout three-and five-year performer . And Founders , the only no-load ( as you can see from its funds ' generally lower expense projections ) , has the leas in hot performers in 1991 . That 's because of its small-stock entries  --  Discovery , Frontier and Special  --  which have ridden this year 's rally to gains in excess of 21% .
