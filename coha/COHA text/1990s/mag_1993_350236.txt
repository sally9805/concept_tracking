Late on Election Day last week , the message magicians who had brilliantly guided Bill Clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign could hardly contain themselves . James Carville and Paul Begala predicted a " twofer " : Governor Jim Florio , their horse in New Jersey , would coast to re-election , and politicians everywhere would learn the Big Lesson . " Florio shows you can do the hard things that have to be done ( ( like raising taxes ) ) and defeat an opponent who offers feel-good stuff ( ( like tax cuts ) ) , " Carville crowed . <P> Reality hit within hours . The race that would make the case for activist government was lost . Carville and Begala were almost too depressed to put their spin on things . " I could n't look Florio in the eye last night , " Carville began . " But , " he added , pitching forward cheerfully , " today 's the first time in a while that I read the business section before the front page . " Sure enough , the " real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : housing starts , manufacturing , productivity and construction spending were all up . Perhaps the man who had won the White House by promising to focus his laser on the economy would be safe in 1996 after all . " Not to worry , " Carville boomed cheerfully , seeming to speak mostly to himself . <P> Begala , the more sober of the duo  --  which is n't saying much , since it 's hard to imagine anyone more crazed than Carville  --  saw lots to worry about . In fact , in the battle about whether the ' 93 results mean everything ( the Republican view ) or nothing ( the President 's ) , Begala is a virtual heretic . " What these Republican victories mean is that the folks in Congress , who * are risk averse to start with , are now going to be more skittish than ever , " Begala said . " And that includes most Democrats . The fear of change is being fed , big time . " <P> Nonetheless , Begala urges pressing ahead . " The President has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has to deliver now , and it 's in the Democratic Congress 's interest to help him . " Why ? " Because people want change even though it scares them . We should pass all kinds of stuff and then go to the voters and say , ' Hey , some of it may not work , but we 're finally doing things . We 've got this baby humming now , and that 's what 's important . ' " <P> Begala 's argument makes a virtue of necessity : retreating to passivity would doom Clinton for sure . But the polls describe a suspicious electorate that views the President 's call for " more efficient " government as a cover for bigger government and more spending , which the voters very definitely do not want . <P> The greatest trouble for Clinton is a robust Republican Party , especially an ideologically cohesive , naysaying congressional delegation capable of staying the President 's innate activism . " History says we 'll gain about three Senate and 20 House seats in ' 94 , " says former G.O.P. national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do even better . The big break for us in the latest results is going to come in candidate recruitment . These days , too few good people want to expose themselves to the scrutiny that comes when you run for office . That 's magnified when running looks like suicide ; no one wants to lose and be cut up at the same time . Clinton 's perceived weakness and these victories can overcome that hesitation . Better people will take a chance and better candidates mean more wins . "
