A Canadian takes on the AMA 's line of bull against her country 's health-care system . <p> New Year 's Day 1990 , 10 P.M. The phone rings . " Mrs. Haiven , drop everything and come to the hospital immediately . Your husband has had a serious heart attack . He 's critical . " <p> I think : " Larry may be dead . They do n't tell you over the phone if your husband has died . " I rack my brain for the number of an emergency baby-sitter . That morning , when I drove him to the Royal University Hospital 's emergency department , Larry complained of not feeling well and general malaise . I tried to convince him it was the flu . Even the emergency doctor smiled at his complaints . " Everyone gets heartburn , stomachaches , and depressed over this season . It 's the drinking , the overeating , and the stress of Christmas . " But hospitals do n't take chances with men over a certain age complaining of chest pains . They decided to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A heart attack . <p> Boiled down , the medical chart indicated that , for Larry , a forty-one-year-old university professor and former union organizer , our quiet life in the small prairie city of Saskatoon , Saskatchewan , had n't been enough to counteract bad genes , bad diet , and years of stressful work . <p> Course of treatment : Monitoring in the cardiac care unit , followed by several days on the medical ward . Tests assigned : blood work , electrocardiogram , X-ray , ultrasound , angiogram , exercise stress test , and others . Prescribed : Medication to ease cardiac function and to " thin " blood . Prognosis : The patient seems to be doing well and will be discharged to a cardiac rehabilitation program and placed on relevant medication . <p> Charge to patient : $0.00 . The costs will be paid by the provincial government medical insurance . This is Canada , after ail . <p> When the initial shock had worn off and Larry began to recover , I , like many baby boomers , realized with a jolt that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving inexorably closer to the center of our concerns . With a sigh , I thought : " It could be worse . We could have been living in the United States . " <p> I had seen American friends burdened with unending payments on uninsured medical bills . I had listened to stories of seniors deprived of their savings to pay for chronic care . I had watched TV shows about patient " dumping " after the most cursory emergency treatment . I shuddered as I wondered what it would have been like if my husband had been hospitalized in the United States . <p> I did n't have long to wait to find out . The doctors gave their blessing to a brief holiday in a warmer climate , and we flew to Southern California in February to stay with our friends Connie and Mike . But we cut short a visit to Sea World when Larry complained of chest pains . When the pains persisted , I called 911 . " I sure hope you have insurance for down here , " whispered Connie , as the ambulance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , we had taken out private insurance for our trip . But the hospital clerk wanted cash or charge , up front . Catching sight of a VISA sign , I quickly calculated the balance on our spending limit . Not much left . " Look , they 're on holidays down here , " pleaded Mike and Connie . " They have insurance . We 'll vouch for them . " <p> " I 'll have to get permission from my boss , " the clerk warned . Then , frowning as she returned , she said , " Seeing as you 're Canadian , we 'll make an exception this time . " <p> Fortunately , it was n't a second heart attack . But by the time the cardiologist determined this , Larry had spent four nights in the hospital , including one in intensive care , receiving virtually all the same tests and medications as in Canada . For the hospital stay , specialists ' fees , private lab work , and the ambulance , the charge was $12,590.34 ( over $15,000 Canadian ) . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of toothpaste ( $5.25 ) , the aspirin pill ( $4.14 ) , and the laxative ( $17.04 ) , which Larry did n't take . <p> I knew that a similar course of treatment in Canada would be " free " to the patient . But I wondered what it would really cost the health system as a whole . I consulted the authorities and learned that Larry 's treatment in Saskatoon had cost the system $3,500 ( U.S. ) . <p> The United States spends more on health care per person than any country in the world : 38 percent more than Canada , 124 percent more than Japan , and 171 percent more than Great Britain . And the bill is rising . Meanwhile , health indicators of Americans rank among the lowest in the industrialized world . It is no small wonder that polls show that a large majority of Americans , some corporate leaders , and even a sizable group of doctors would prefer a health-care system like Canada 's . <p> Imagine my surprise , then , when I learned that America 's single largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's healthcare system . What began as a pair of family crises turned into a personal investigation into how the two nations , when it comes to keeping their citizens healthy , really compare . <p> The Great Anti-Canada Disinformation Campaign <p> From the desk of Alan R. Nelson , M.D. , president , American Medical Association : <p> Dear Doctor : <p> If you disagree with certain leaders in our government who think bureaucrats can run the nation 's health-care system better than we can , here 's your opportunity to do something about it . <p> A Canadian-type health-care system could cause rationing of medical services . Of course , " free " care has an understandable appeal . So you and , I have a real challenge to inform the public about the problems lurking in this utopian promise . <p> We must educate people . And we must do it now because tomorrow may be too late . Unless you want to risk rationing , income caps , reduction of your autonomy , and other burdens of a Canadian-type experience very soon , please help us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely find the level of excellence in our country 's health care diminished . <p> Make your contribution of $200 ( or more ) payable to AMA . ... Do it now . Or we may risk a bureaucratic health-care tangle we may never be able to undo . <p> This comes from one of several letters that nearly 300,000 physician members of the AMA started finding in their mailboxes at the end of 1989 . " The AMA has created a program that is telling millions of Americans the facts about the Canadian health-care system ... , " reads another plea for funds . A third " Dear Doctor " letter , from former AMA executive vice-president James Sammons , M.D. , is explicit : " Our proposal : An intensive program to alert Congress and voters to the dangers of a Canadian-type health-care system . " <p> While the AMA refuses to disclose how much money the campaign raised , cash was earmarked to pay for full-page ads pillorying Canadian-style Medicare in the New York Times , Washington Post , Wall Street Journal , U.S. News &; World Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young , soulful-eyed girl with the headline IN SOME COUNTRIES SHE COULD WAIT MONTHS FOR HER SURGERY . " We 're not talking about life in the Third World , " it continues . " Some of the most advanced industrial countries on earth have health-care systems that are underfunded , overextended , and ill-equipped . " Another ad  --  " The U.S. health-care system vs. the Canadian system . An honest comparison "  --  cites waiting lists for angiograms and heart bypass surgery in Quebec , and waiting lists and delays of up to eight months for open-heart surgery at Toronto 's Hospital For Sick Children . A chart shows that Canada has only 14 hospitals that perform organ transplants , compared with 319 in the United States . <p> The uniformly bleak picture painted of Canada was n't one that I recognized . And the ads apparently generated little good response in the United States . By February of 1990 , the advertising campaign was officially pulled . Paul Tarini , PR representative for the AMA , explains : " We decided on a more positive approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada . " <p> " The AMA has lost a lot of political capital through those ads , " says an aide to Congressman Pete Stark ( D-CA ) , chairman of the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee . " After all , if a lobbying organization has paid for ads that are misleading or untrue , why should anyone trust them ? Many people saw the AMA 's campaign as out to protect doctors ' incomes . " Republican congressman Bill Gradison , a member of the House Budget Subcommittee on Health , is also critical of the ads : " They were misleading . " <p> " Troglodytes " is what Stark calls the AMA . " In 1965 , when Medicare came in , the AMA was against it . They were also against the surgeon general 's report that said smoking caused cancer . " Stark assures me that while the anti-Canada ad campaign is off for now , the AMA , in loose concert with the insurance industry , is spending millions of dollars in more covert attempts to smear the Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Tarini to substantiate for me the " facts " against my country 's health-care system , alluded to in the AMA letter , he said : " If you 're looking for a laundry list , I ca n't supply it . When we say the facts ' about your Medicare , we mean it rhetorically . " <p> When I asked to speak to a higher official within the AMA who could specifically defend the charges against the Canadian system , Tarini told me that a face-to-face interview would n't be possible , but he 'd arrange a phone conversation with the proper AMA trustee . That turned out to be New Orleans diagnostic radiologist Dr. Daniel H. Johnson , Jr. , vice-speaker of the AMA House of Delegates . A Vietnam veteran who grew up in Texas , Johnson assured me in his gentlemanly southern drawl that , while he had never personally visited Canada , he had met many Canadian doctors critical of their own health-care system . <p> I asked Johnson how his AMA can contend that the United States ' has the " highest quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans have no health-care insurance and a further thirty million are underinsured . Johnson agrees with the figures , but looks at them differently : " Eighty-five percent of people in America have insurance of one kind or other . " What U.S. citizens need , argues Johnson , is a health-care system that relies more heavily on " a true market system . " But if the unfettered market can control costs better than Canada 's approach , why is health care so much more costly in your country , I ask . Johnson offers three reasons : <p> One : Because U.S. insurance often covers too much of the tab , he says , people seeking health care do n't have incentive to " shop " like true price-conscious consumers . A freer market could create " cost differences and drive people toward excellence . " <p> Two : Americans have more high-technology medicine . According to AMA figures , compared to Canada , the United States has per capita eight times the number of MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) machines , six times the number of lithotripsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of heart-catheterization facilities , three times the number of radiation-therapy locales , and twice the number of hospitals for organ transplants . Dr. Johnson boasts : " We 've got as many MRI machines in the greater New Orleans area as in your entire country . MRI is not generally available in Canada . " This turns out to be the only concrete example of Canadian inferiority offered by Johnson , and it comes to hand naturally : the MRI is one of the scanning devices that Johnson uses in his own private diagnostic clinic . <p> Johnson concludes with explanation three for the higher cost of U.S. health care : malpractice suits . The insurance against them and the defensive medicine needed to prevent them are expensive . <p> When I suggest that the biggest argument against Canada-bashing by the AMA is that leading health indicators show that Americans as a whole receive worse care than Canadians , Johnson answers : " You can not lay the problems of infant mortality and life expectancy at the feet of the health-care system . We have enormous social problems .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all citizens that is not meeting the needs of our people . It does n't do any good to have the finest obstetricians if you ca n't get the people to take advantage of what 's there for them . " <p> I ask , Would you , as a medical doctor , be as quick to disclaim responsibility if the health indicators were the other way around ? He does n't answer , when I bring up Congressman Stark 's name , Johnson says : " He 's an ongoing thorn in our side . He 's not even polite . We spent $300,000 trying to defeat him . " Busting the AMA 's Favorite Myths <p> TAKING ON DR . JOHNSON , HIS ARGUMENTS , and his AMA is one of the missions of Physicians for a National Health Program . PNHP was cofounded in 1986 by Drs . David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler , assistant professors of medicine at Harvard Medical School and internists at Cambridge Hospital . Now the doctors are cochairs of the three-thousand-member national advocacy group , which is trying to win a national health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , States . <p> When PNHP 's proposal for this first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine , in January 1989 , it created a sensation and added fuel to an already-building grassroots movement . Today , says Dr. Himmelstein , eight states have bills in the works that would fund all medical care through a staterun agency . Ohio is on the verge of passing such a bill , a direct application of the Canadian model . " We 've looked into most health-care systems in Europe and in Japan , " explains Dr. Himmelstein . " The Canadian one seems to be the best option . It presents the least dislocation to our system , since doctors and patients will still have the same sort of relationship . The severe dislocation will be for the insurance companies . " <p> Dr. Himmelstein spent two years in Canada as a student at McGill University in Montreal , graduated in 1978 from Columbia University , and interned at Oakland 's Highland Hospital , where he " saw major change was needed . " Some of the changes proposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Woolhandler , who interned in family practice at San Francisco General Hospital , says that a Canadian-style health-care system would improve the situation in two ways : " First , in the U.S. , many people injured by doctors are forced to sue for future health-care costs because they have no other way to pay for the ongoing health-care costs they require . Often they can no longer get insurance . But in Canada , these health-care costs are covered for the patient 's lifetime . Second , a Canadian-style system improves the relationship between the doctor and the patient , because , in the day-to-day clinical encounter , no money changes hands . This may mean the patient is less likely to sue . " <p> What about Johnson 's MRI example , an AMA favorite ? Dr. Himmelstein agrees that MRIs can be very useful . " The MRI gives a picture 3-D look inside the body , which in some situations is better than the CT scanner . But it 's overused in many circumstances ; if you know you 're going to operate , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a man with a bad back who had eight MRIs within a one-year span . That just is n't necessary . A radiologist can make millions from MRI machines . At eight hundred dollars a scan , it 's enormously lucrative . " <p> Dr. Himmelstein makes the point that a medical dollar spent on technology is one not spent elsewhere . " One in three pregnant women in the U.S. does n't get prenatal care because of lack of insurance . Spending money on them would give us , as a society , more bang for our buck . MRI is a trade-off for not doing very much that 's needed . " Woolhandler adds : " In Canada , you limit MRIs and concentrate resources in primary and routine health care . You have more rational use of technology there than we do in the U.S. " <p> In one of its big attack points , the AMA charges that Canada rations other high-tech medicine , citing the fact that there are eight times the number of open-heart-surgery facilities in the United States . But Toronto medical reformer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that having so many places performing medical specialties can actually spell inferior health care . Dr. Rachlis , author of the 1989 popular best-seller Second Opinion : What 's Wrong with Canada 's Health-Care System and How to Fix It , is well known for his outspoken charge that his own system could deliver more  --  but he 's no fan of the U.S. version . " Even with eight times the openheart facilities and the most aggressive cardiac surgeons in the world , U.S. hospitals only do twice the number of open-heart surgeries per 100,000 population . " <p> Canadian facilities are fewer but , on average , larger , explains Rachlis , and " the larger the unit , the more operations it does and the lower the mortality rate from surgery . While all those U.S. hospitals may have the capacity to do bypass surgery , the smaller the unit , the fewer the operations and the poorer the quality of surgery . " What Your Doctor Dollar Really Buys <p> ASK DR . HIMMELSTEIN OF PNHP THE REAL reasons why U.S. health care costs so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AMA declines to talk about . What 's the difference between the $1,400 per capita spent on medical care in Canada and the $2,000 per capita spent in the United States each year ? Himmelstein finds : <p> About half goes to higher U.S. administrative costs : doctors and hospitals billing insurance companies , and the profits they take for providing service . <p> A quarter goes to more U.S. high-tech purchases . <p> The last quarter goes to increased incomes for U.S. doctors . <p> The average U.S. hospital has fifty employees using one million dollars ' worth of equipment to deal with billing . Eighteen percent of U.S. health-care spending goes to billing and administration . The average Canadian hospital has six billing personnel ; 8 percent is spent on billing the single payer ( the provincial government ) and other administrative tasks . <p> In addition , the average U.S. physician spends about seven minutes per patient on paperwork , with another seven dollars going to bookkeeping staff . The average Canadian physician spends thirty seconds and about one dollar on billing per patient . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money . First , their administrative costs are much higher than those of Canada 's ten government insurance plans . The Cleveland Plain Dealer found that Mutual of Omaha , Golden Rule , and Aetna insurance companies spent an average of 27 percent of every health-care dollar on administration in 1989 . In the same year , Ontario 's government health-insurance plan spent just 1.8 percent of every dollar on administration . <p> Second , unlike the Canadian plans , the three U.S. insurance companies listed above made an average profit of 5.4 percent . Meanwhile , the average U.S. physician nets $145,000 a year , while his or her Canadian counterpart nets $87,823 ( U.S. ) . " U.S. doctors ' mouths are stuffed with cash to keep them quiet , " says Himmelstein . " The Canadian system gives more clinical freedom at the expense of more economic restraint , i.e. , salaries . " However , Himmelstein finds that Canadian doctors earn a very decent living . They are among the highest income earners in the country , at four times the average industrial wage . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adamant that Canada restricts a physician 's freedom and a patient 's choice , and says that buying medical care should be the same as going out and purchasing a dishwasher . " People , " he says , " drive thirty miles to save a hundred dollars on a twelve-thousand-dollar automobile , but they would n't drive three blocks to save a hundred dollars on a CT scan . " <p> You 've got to be kidding , says Canada 's Dr. Rachlis . " Health care is not a regular sort of market . A really free market would mean abandoning licensing for physicians , and opening up the medical profession to midwives , homeopaths , and others . I 'm sure the AMA does n't want that . They ca n't have it both ways-licensing doctors and regulating the practice of medicine and a free market for health care . " <p> But Dr. Johnson insists that " the patient is in the driver 's seat .... The patient can say , ' Doctor , why in the hell are you charging me five thousand dollars for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it for three thousand ? ' " <p> " You ca n't phone around when you 're having a heart attack , " Dr. Rachlis scoffs . " You ca n't shop around when you have an urgent medical , problem . You have to rely on your doctor to advise you about what course of action to take . " <p> What choice do patients really have in the two countries ? In 1988 , only 28 percent of all U.S. health4nsurance plans allowed people to see any doctor they chose . Yet in Canada , patients can see any GP they want and change as often as they wish . And in most cases , they can see any specialist they want . Both doctors and patients have more choice in Canada . <p> But the " biggest advantage of the Canadian system , " says PNHP 's Dr. Woolhandler , " is access . The rich and poor use the same system . In Boston I see a lot of people who can not get care , who come for care too late . " She tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after giving birth . " She had tuberculosis . She had had a cough for the last year , and often TB worsens during pregnancy . There was a place she could have gotten free medical care , but she did n't know about it . She came to us , but it was too late . She died , leaving a two-week-old and another child . " <p> About 300,000 times a year , people are turned away from U.S. hospitals . Over a million families who seek medical attention are rebuffed , and a higher number never seek it out at all due to lack of money or no insurance . A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 15 percent of people with insurance reported that they could not get " extras " like nursing care , drugs , and physiotherapy , because those services were n't covered by their plans . <p> And there is nothing universal about the American health " safety net . " Medicaid covers only 38 percent of the U.S. poor , and many people on Medicare need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to paying deductibles . <p> Though Dr. Johnson does n't like the way the U.S. government runs Medicare and state governments run Medicaid , mostly because of the excessive paperwork and administrative work borne by doctors , he insists that both programs only need to be shored up-an unlikely prescription from one who wants the free market to hold sway . " Instead of trashing our system , we have to correct those weaknesses and build on the strengths . We are trying , " Johnson assures me , " to restructure the Medicare/Medicaid programs so that everyone who is indigent is eligible for the Medicaid program . " Flirting with the S Word <p> IT MAY SEEM A MONOLITH , BUT THE American Medical Association represents only about half the physicians in the United States , mostly general practitioners . The nation 's other nearly 300,000 doctors are members of other professional organizations , many of them dedicated to changing the way the U.S. health-care system works . <p> One major player is the **27;533;TOOLONG American College of Physicians ( ACP ) , the United States ' largest group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canadian system , the ACP is scathingly critical of the AMA for offering no solution to the country 's medical mess . The group issued a white paper in May 1990 that calls the millions of Americans ' lack of access to good care a " national tragedy " and proposes , among other solutions , establishment of a universal health-insurance program . <p> Dr. John Ball , the ACP 's executive vicepresident , supports a Canadian-style singlepayer system , adding , " What we are saying is that , regardless of its strengths , the American health-care system no longer serves this nation , its patients , or physicians . " Other advocates of reform include the National Association of Social Workers and Nurses for National Health Care . <p> While some of those reformers look north for a better model , cutting-edge Canadians continue trying to improve their own system - and there is plenty of room to do so . <p> First , it 's expensive . In fact , next to the United States , Canada has the most expensive per capita health-care system in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common . According to Toronto 's Dr. Rachlis , better than 40 percent of each province 's health-care budget is spent on hospitals , rather than community-based medicine like clinics , health promotion programs , and preventive care . <p> Second , as equitable as Canada 's system is , it does n't change the bigger equation : in a society that creates poverty , poor people get sick more than rich people . David Schreck , a Vancouver-based health economist explains : " Equal access to health care is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for equality of health status . In all systems , poor people die sooner . " He adds , " At least in the Canadian system , people are n't made poor by the cost of medical care . " <p> Third , there are waiting lists for some procedures , and thus an ongoing search for how to shorten them . Mainly in Ontario and British Columbia , there are waiting lists for open-heart and bypass surgery . But because the lists are ordered sensibly , " despite the AMA 's rumor-mongering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died because of excessive waiting time , " maintains Dr. Rachlis . He points out that all health systems , given limited resources , ration their care , but most just do n't admit it . " Waiting lists seem preferable to the American system ; which limits access , " he says . " Poor people are dying because of lack of access . " <p> A few years ago , a national poll found that 61 percent of all Americans said they would favor a system like Canada 's , in which " the government pays most of the cost of health care for everyone out of taxes , and the government sets all fees charged by hospitals and doctors . " Eighty-nine percent saw their health-care system needing fundamental change . What the AMA and other enemies of our Canadian system seem to be banking on is the notion that people in the United States will turn up their noses at a good alternative if it can be made to seem ideologically impure , somehow un-American . The Americans I 've met tend to be smarter than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I thought made the perfect urban myth ; it was even true : <p> At a council meeting , a group of New England selectmen was considering a proposal by a local veterinarian that the town pay for sterilizing dogs and cats to reduce the nuisance of strays . Members of the council were enthusiastic . Just before passing the motion , they sought opinion from a local lawyer who sat in at meetings . " I do n't see any legal problem , " he chuckled . " But you realize this is socialized medicine . " <p> Aghast , the selectmen dropped their motion . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> BY JUDY HAIVEN <p> <p> Judy Haiven is a Canadian documentary film maker , and the author of Faith , Hope , No Charity : An Inside Look at the " Born Again " Movement in the United States and Canada .

Within ten years , provincial governments of all political stripes had enthusiastically followed . The federal government now helps fund Medicare in all the provinces , guaranteeing universal , comprehensive , publicly administered care , transferable across province lines . Nowadays , no one , Left , Right , or Center , seriously suggests dismantling Medicare . In practice , it works on five levels . <p> First , Medicare is a universal and comprehensive plan that covers the majority of medical services , including office visits to the doctor , drugs for people over sixty-five , treatments , tests , lab fees , X-rays , surgery , and hospitalization . Depending on the province , Medicare may also cover nonphysician services , such as physical therapy , chiropractic treatment , drugs , and children 's dental care . <p> Second , Medicare outlaws private insurance except for services not covered by Medicare , such as travel insurance ( outside of Canada ) , semiprivate or private rooms in hospitals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system provides for standardized billing for practitioners . There is no coinsurance , no deductibles , no user fees , and no extra billing by physicians . A patient need only show his health-care card , and the doctor will bill the provincial Medicare system for the services provided . Whether for an office visit , an appendectomy , or open-heart surgery , the doctor bills the government on a standardized form , and gets paid , usually within thirty days . <p> Fourth , more than 95 percent of Canadian doctors are self-employed  --  many more than in the free-enterprise United States . Each provincial government and its doctors negotiate a " fee-for-service " schedule for all physicians ' services , and these are the only fees that doctors are allowed to bill . <p> Finally , all hospitals and a few clinics negotiate total budgets with the provincial departments of health . They get an annual grant to cover all hospital services , new programs , and expanded services , as warranted . <p> Who pays for all of this ? All monies for Medicare are raised through income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Columbia , there are insurance premiums that cost about $425 ( U.S. ) per family per year . The other eight provinces do n't charge premiums . <p> Medicare is cost-shared with the federal government , meaning that poorer provinces pay less of the cost than richer ones . in this way , the system tries to equalize the quality of health care across the country . <p> By Judy Haiven <p>
