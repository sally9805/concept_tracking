HALLOWEEN STREET . NO ONE could remember who had first given it that name . It had no other . There was no street sign , had never been a street sign . Halloween Street bordered the creek , and there was only one way to get there - over a rickety bridge of rotting wood . Gray timbers had worn partway through the vague red stain . The city had declared it safe only for foot or bike traffic . <p> The street had only eight houses , and no one could remember more than three of those being occupied at any one time . Renters never lasted long . <p> It was a perfect place to take other kids- the smaller ones , or the ones a little more nervous than yourself - on Halloween night . Just to give them a little scare . Just to get them to wet their pants . <p> Most of the time all the houses stayed empty . An old lady had supposedly lived in one of the houses for years , but no one knew anything more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years before . Elderly twin brothers had once owned the two center houses , each with twin high-peaked gables on the second story like skeptical eyebrows , narrow front doors , and small windows that froze over every winter . The brothers had lived there only six months , fighting loudly with each other the entire time . <p> The houses at the ends of the street were in the worst shape , missing most of their roof shingles and sloughing off paint chips the way a tree sheds leaves . Both houses leaned toward the center of the block , as if two great hands had attempted to squeeze the block from either side . Another three houses had suffered outside fire damage . The blackened boards looked like permanent , arbitrary shadows . <p> But it was the eighth house that bothered the kids the most . There was nothing wrong with it . <p> It was the kind of house any of them would have liked to live in . Painted bright white like a dairy so that it glowed even at night , with wide friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew naturally and a lawn seemingly immune to weeds . <p> Who took care of it ? It just did n't make any sense . Even when the kids guided newcomers over to Halloween Street they stayed away from the white house . <p> The little girl 's name was Laura , and she lived across the creek from Halloween Street . From her bedroom window she could see all the houses . She could see who went there and she could see everything they did . She did n't stop to analyze , or pass judgments . She merely witnessed , and now and then spoke an almost inaudible " Hi " to her window and to those visiting on the other side . An occasional " Hi " to the houses of Halloween Street . <p> Laura should have been pretty . She had wispy blonde hair so pale it appeared white in most light , worn long down her back . She had small lips and hands that were like gauges to her health : soft and pink when she was feeling good , pale and dry when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty . There was nothing really wrong about her face : it was just vague . A cruel aunt with a drinking problem used to say that " it lacked character . " Her mother once took her to a lady who cut silhouette portraits out of crisp black paper at a shopping mall . Her mother paid the lady five dollars to do one of Laura . The lady had finally given up in exasperation , exclaiming " The child has no profile ! " <p> Laura overheard her mother and father talking about it one time . " I see things in her face , " her mother had said . <p> " What do you mean ? " Her father always sounded impatient with her mother . <p> " I do n't know what I mean ! I see things in her face and I can never remember exactly what I saw ! Shadows and ... white , something so white I feel like she 's going to disappear into it . Like clouds ... or a snowbank . " <p> Her father had laughed in astonishment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I mean ! " her mother shouted back . " You do n't even look at her directly anymore because you know what I mean ! It 's not exactly sadness in her face , not exactly . Just something born with her , something out of place . She was born out of place . My God ! She 's eleven years old ! She 's been like this since she was a baby ! " <p> " She 's a pretty little girl . " Laura could tell her father did n't really mean that . <p> " What about her eyes ? Tell me about her eyes , Dick ! " <p> " What about her eyes ? She has nice eyes ... " <p> " Describe them for me , then ! Can you describe them ? What color are they ? What shape ? " <p> Her father did n't say anything . Soon after the argument he 'd stomped out of the house . Laura knew he could n't describe her eyes . Nobody could . <p> Laura did n't make judgments when other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched with eyes no one could describe . Eyes no one could remember . <p> No , it was n't that she was sad , Laura thought . It was n't that her parents were mean to her or that she had a terrible life . Her parents were n't ever mean to her and although she did n't know exactly what kind of life she had , she knew it was n't terrible . <p> She did n't enjoy things like other kids did . She did n't enjoy playing or watching television or talking to the other kids . She did n't enjoy , really . She had quiet thoughts , instead . She had quiet thoughts when she pretended to be asleep but was really listening to all her parents ' conversations , all their arguments . She had quiet thoughts when she watched people . She had quiet thoughts when people could not describe her eyes . She had quiet thoughts while gazing at Halloween Street , the glowing white house , and all the things that happened there . <p> She had quiet thoughts pretending that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had n't been born anyplace at all . <p> Laura could have been popular , living so close to Halloween Street , seeing it out of her bedroom window . No other kid lived so close or had such a good view . But of course she was n't popular . She did n't share Halloween Street . She sat at her desk at school all day and did n't talk about Halloween Street at all . <p> THAT LAST HALLOWEEN Laura got dressed to go out . That made her mother happy - Laura had never gone trick-or-treating before . Her mother had always encouraged her to go , had made or bought her costumes , taken her to parties at church or school , parties the other kids dressed up for : ghosts and vampires and princesses , giggling and running around with their masks like grotesquely swollen heads . But Laura would n't wear a costume . She 'd sit solemn-faced , unmoving , until her mother finally gave up and took her home . And she 'd never go trick-or-treating , never wear a costume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out that night her mother had driven her around town desperately trying to find a costume for her . Laura sat impassively on the passenger side , dutifully got out at each store her mother took her to , and each time shook her head when asked if she liked each of the few remaining costumes . <p> " I do n't know where else we can try , Laura , " her mother said , sorting through a pile of mismatched costume pieces at a drugstore in a mall . " It 'll be dark in a couple of hours , and so far you have n't liked a thing I 've shown you . " <p> : aura reached into the pile and pulled out a cheap face mask . The face was that of a middle aged woman , or a young man , cheeks and lips rouged a bright red , eye shadow dark as a bruise , eyebrows a heavy and coarse dark line . <p> " But , honey . Is n't that a little ... " Laura shoved the mask into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She picked up a bundle of bright blue cloth from the table . " How about this pretty robe to go with it ? " Laura did n't look at the robe . She just nodded and headed for the door , her face already a mask itself . <p> Laura left the house that night after most of the other trick-or-treaters had come and gone . Her interest in Halloween actually seemed less than ever this year ; she stayed in her bedroom as goblins and witches and all manner of stunted , warped creatures came to the front door singly and in groups , giggling and dancing and playing tricks on each other . She could see a few of them over on Halloween Street , not going up to any of the houses but rather running up and down the short street close to the houses in I-dare-you races . But not near as many as in years past . <p> Now and then her mother would come up and open her door . " Honey , do n't you want to leave yet ? I swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't go soon . " And each time Laura shook her head , still staring out the window , still watching Halloween Street . <p> Finally , after most of the other kids had returned to their homes , Laura came down the stairs wearing her best dress and the cheap mask her mother had bought for her . <p> Her father and mother were in the living room , her mother having retrieved the blue robe from the hall closet . <p> " She 's wearing her best dress , Ann . Besides , it 's damned late for her to be going out now . " <p> Her mother eyed her nervously . " I could drive you , honey . " Laura shook her head . <p> " Well , okay , just let me cover your nice dress with the robe . Do n't want to get it dirty . " <p> " She 's just a kid , for chrissake ! We ca n't let her decide ! " Her father had dropped his newspaper on the floor . He turned his back on Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how angry he was with both of them . But Laura knew . " And that mask ! Looks like a whore 's face ! Hell , how can she even see ? Ca n't even see her eyes under that . " But Laura could see his . All red and sad-looking . <p> " She 's doing something normal for a change , " her mother whispered harshly . " Ca n't you see that ? That 's more important . " <p> Without a word Laura walked over and pulled the robe out of her mother 's arms . After some hesitation , after Laura 's father had stomped out of the room , her mother helped her get it on . It was much too large , but her mother gasped " How beautiful ! " in exaggerated fashion . Laura walked toward the door . Her mother ran to the door and opened it ahead of her . " Have a good time ! " she said in a mock cheery voice . Laura could see the near-panic in the eyes above the distorted grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few houses down the sidewalk she pulled the robe off and threw it behind a hedge . She walked on , her head held stiff and erect , the mask 's rouge shining bright red in the streetlights , her best dress a soft cream color in the dimness , stirred lightly by the breeze . She walked on to Halloween Street . <p> She stopped on the bridge and looked down into the creek . A young man 's face , a middle-aged woman 's face gazed back at her out of dark water and yellow reflections . The mouth seemed to be bleeding . <p> She walked on to Halloween Street . She was the only one there . The only one to see . <p> She walked on in her best dress and her shiny mask with eyes no one could see . <p> The houses on Halloween street looked the way they always did , empty and dark . Except for the one that glowed the color of clouds , or snow . <p> The houses on Halloween Street looked their own way , sounded their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own quiet thoughts . Born out of place . <p> You could not see their eyes . <p> Laura went up to the white house with the neatly trimmed yard and the flowers that grew without care . Its color like blowing snow . Its color like heaven . She went inside . <p> The old woman gazed out her window as goblins and spooks , pirates and ballerinas crossed the bridge to enter Halloween Street . She bit her lip to make it redder . She rubbed at her ancient , blind eyes , rubbing the dark eyeshadow up into the coarse line of brow . She was not beautiful , but she was not hideous either . Not yet . In any case no one ever remembered her face . <p> Her fine , snow-white hair was beautiful , and long down her back . She had the most wonderful house on the street , the only one with flowers , the only one that glowed . It was her home , the place where she belonged . All the children , all the children who dared , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come along , " she said to the window , staring out at Halloween Street . " Come along , " she said , as the treat bags rustled and shifted around her . " You do n't remember , do you ? " as the first of the giggling goblins knocked at her door . " You 've quite forgotten , " as the door began to shake from eager goblin fists , eager goblin laughs . " Now scratch your swollen little head , scratch your head . You forgot that first and last , Halloween is for the dead . " ' <p> Author Affiliation
