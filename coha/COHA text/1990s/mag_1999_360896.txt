The one-eyed man appears to be talking about chess . " In order to kill your enemies you should know how to move your pawns , " says Hun Sen , Prime Minister of Cambodia . But his thoughts are really on his kind of politics . There are no political opponents , only enemies to be eliminated ; no debate , only plots to survive . " If you lead with your big pieces , you put them in danger . " He knows about danger . He followed and abandoned the genocidal dictator Pol Pot , survived the Khmer Rouge 's killing fields and civil war to become master of a country haunted by 1.7 million unavenged ghosts . For Hun Sen , power means survival , and it has only two settings : all or nothing . <P> Hun Sen lives in the Tiger 's Den , a fortified five-acre compound half an hour 's drive from the capital , Phnom Penh . There , during the sporadic outbursts of fighting that threaten his rule , he retreats to his emergency war room , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof . Inside is a small bedroom . " You see this ? " he asks , pointing to a closet with a mirror on the front . " Inside , there is a secret trapdoor into the basement . When you are a soldier , you have to know the ways of escape . " He regrets he can not go to restaurants ; he fears assassination too much . Last year an attempt was made on his life in a northern town , using remote-controlled rockets . " In a way I am living in a prison without walls , " he tells TIME . Within the compound , he often works till 1 a.m. or 2 a.m , and last week he was busily pitting his instinct to survive against the U.S. State Department 's preferred way of dealing with the Khmer Rouge 's bloody legacy . His only relaxation is chess . Grinning , he says , " I usually win . " <P> The Prime Minister very rarely grins . He is better known for a brooding scowl and outbursts of temper . But on March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wedding . His smile was broadcast over a huge video screen to 5,000 guests at tables spread around his house in the Tiger 's Den . Hun Sen was doubly happy , he said in his speech , not only because of his daughter 's marriage but also because that very day his troops had arrested Ta Mok , the Khmer Rouge leader also known as " the Butcher , " the last of the rebel commanders still at large since the death of the fugitive Pol Pot in the jungle last year . But diplomats at the feast were less than pleased . Hun Sen said Ta Mok was to be tried in a Cambodian court , not in the international tribunal the U.N . has been planning for months , and he did not talk about arresting other Khmer Rouge leaders . In fact , Hun Sen admitted to TIME that he was " scared " of putting all the aging leaders on trial at this time . <P> Only two years ago , Hun Sen requested U.N . assistance in setting up an international tribunal to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity this century has seen . Last month three independent U.N . jurists presented him with a report on how 20 to 30 top Khmer Rouge leaders could be put on trial in another Asian country . But after two decades of denouncing the " genocidal regime of Pol Pot , " Hun Sen is balking . " We have no confidence in an international court of law , " he says .
