Innocents abroad probably thought that a simple tennis tournament was all that started in London last week . In fact , what also was occurring in glorious tandem to Wimbledon was something chock-full of far more fun and breathtaking excitement  --  another heated round of the ongoing circulation war within one of merry and randy olde England 's cherished institutions , the tabloid press . // If you really have to faint , do it in private Diana  --  Charles Taunt as she collapses on Starvation diet . This was an actual headline last week in The Sun , London 's most popular daily newspaper ( circulation : four million ) , which purported to represent something that actually happened between the Prince and the Princess of Wales , as described in the soon-to-be best-seller Diana : Her True Story by Andrew Morton . // Because the serialization of Morton 's book began two weekends before the championships , there was real fear that the Royals , not to mention the rumps ( ENGELBERT RUMPERDINCK " PLEASE RELEASE ME " FROM MY UNDERPANTS was a headline from News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five million , showing the legendary if awesomely over-the-hill singer Humperdinck , 56 , sunbathing on a boat clad in something that appeared to be a thong ) , would push all news of Wimbledon into the small print on the inside pages of the tabloids amid the phone-sex lines and adverts for " auto setters , " whatever they are , " Looks like a long fortnight for the Beastie Boys , " said Hugh Jamieson of the Daily Mirror , the second-best-selling London tab ( circulation : three million ) , referring to the proud coterie of upstanding journalists who are wont to kick butt and take names but not prisoners in the cause of truth ( well , sort of ) , justice and the Anglican Way . // June 22 , the opening day at the big W , seemed a dark one indeed for hungry monitors of tennis trivia when The Sun also went Royal on its front page : CHARLES : I 'M SURE DIANA IS BEHIND THE BOOK . However , lest Wimbledon fans be forced into the streets cold turkey , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of their favorite stars . GABBY 'S SERVE AND TROLLEY headlined a picture demonstrating how Gabriela Sabatini pushes her own cart at the grocery and a caption speculating about what she buys there . And WIMBLEDIN : YOU MUST CUT OUT YOUR GRUNT STUNT , MONICUGH IS TOLD detailed Monica Seles 's " ear-splitting groans that register as loud as a diesel train " and also described her obnoxious grunting as " disgusting . " // Three separate tabloid investigators brought their " gruntometers " to Seles 's first-round match , against Jenny Byrne . Alas , Byrne was unable to push Seles through any noise-inducing long rallies , so John Jackson , a scribe from the Daily Minor , was soon ringing his office from courtside on a cellular phone . " Jackson here , " he reported . " I am chagrined to say we have a gruntless Monica . " // Nevertheless , two days later  --  the intrepid tabloiders realized that Seles 's grunting would return as her matches got tougher  --  readers of The Sun opened up their fish wrapping to find that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereupon they could hear Seles 's noise and " imitate her Eeern-uuurgh as loudly as you can , " following which " the best efforts on a decibel-meter ... will win a smashing tennis racquet and 10 balls . " // On June 25 the paper revealed to a gasping world that STEFFI 'S BARKING ! SHE PHONES HER POOCHES and brought to light the shocking discovery that " tennis ace Steffi Graf has a cure for feeling wuff ... she calls her four dogs in Germany and natters to them over the phone . The Wimbledon champ misses her mutts so much , she rings the yelpline every day . " // Quite naturally , the very next day the Daily Mirror , not to be scooped , took its place on the cutting edge of the news by reporting that Graf had said , " I need to talk to my dogs every night and morning , " which ( tongue in cheek ) the champion had indeed said . And a Mirror headline screamed , simply enough , PAW GIRL ! // In olden times  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HER TRAIL OF TEARS and I 'LL BE A HOUSE HUSBAND LIKE LENNON , SAYS MAC  --  none of this would have mattered . Wimbledon used to mean not a twit to the " gutter press , " which is how the tabloids are sometimes referred to , as opposed to " broadsheets , " " qualities " or " posh papers " like The Times , The Daily Telegraph and The Observer . Then as the flower children of the 1960s turned into world-class tennis players , upsetting officialdom along with the berry carts , the public responded , and , with that , Fleet Street ran with it . // The player who turned the tabs onto tennis was named , fittingly , Nasty . " I remember getting a call from the office one day in 1969 , " says the Daily Mirror 's Nigel Clarke , the yeoman beast of the Beasties . " They told me to go to the Davis Cup match at Wimbledon . Our boys were playing against Romania , and some maniac clown was tearing the place apart . " // That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking the rules on and off the court . " The bloke actually stuck his tongue out and called an official drunk , " recalls Clarke . " Then came Connors giving the finger and rubbing his crotch ; Borg , the elegant mystery prince ; McEnroe , the defamer brat ; Goolagong , from the Outback ; Chrissie , sweet priss ; Martina , feared lesbian monster . The British public connected to all this . What stories ! What personalities ! Wimbledon was apoplectic ! We all loved it ! " // As Wimbledon  --  not tennis , but Wimbledon  --  increased in popularity across the country , the tabs responded by transferring hard-edged , aggressive reporters from team sports like soccer to the All England Club . The Beasties included the likes of Clarke , Jamieson ( " I do n't do forehands and backhands , mate " ) , Bryan Cooney of the Daily Star , and The Sun 's Steven Howard , a grandson of actor Leslie Howard and a gonzo-style journalist who , according to his colleagues , has become " flat-out dangerous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year when he speculated that Seles was absent from Wimbledon because she was pregnant , i.e. , is MONICA A WIMBLEMUM ? // The Beasties , you must understand , are more select than and separate from the Rotters ( short for rottweilers , those German-bred canines infamous for their aggressiveness and tenacity ) . The Rotters are not sports reporters at all but men , like the gruntometer-bearing Jackson , and women from the news divisions of the Fleet Street papers sent out to Wimbledon to cover the subliminal angles of the tournament , which might turn out to be anything from the price of strawberries to who in the locker room might be bonking whom behind whose back . ( Bonking is British slang for sexual intercourse , and its linkage in the tabloids to Boris Becker  --  as in Bonking Boris Becker  --  has proliferated to the extent that the word now sits with pride in the Oxford Dictionary of New Words. ) // Nonetheless bonking has been scarcely chronicled since Becker started losing the tournament . Its most notable recurrence came last year , when The Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with a woman line judge , resulting in the headline NEW BALLS , PLEASE . // At 57 , Jackson is the doyen of the Rotters , a man known for his frank questioning . At last year 's Wimbledon he asked the new champion , Michael Stich , " Just what do you say when someone asks you , ' Who the hell is Michael Stich ? ' " Last week Jackson asked Andre Agassi to clear up the confusion over why he has taken to wearing a cap . " There is a suggestion you 're losing your hair , " Jackson said . // " Oh , really ? " Agassi wittily rejoined and then mumbled something about growing his sides out and needing his bandana and cap to do that . // " Such nonsense , " Jackson said later . " I 'm dubbing this silly wanker ' the Elton John of Wimbledon . ' " // Clarke 's legend rests on a couple of stories that he finagled with great glee and now recounts in the same spirit . He once wrote that Andrei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Kremlin wall . This entirely contrived story was repeated so often that it turned up in Chesnokov 's official bio in a British news-agency guide . During the 1988 Olympics , following swimmer Anthony Nesty 's upset victory in the 100-meter butterfly , Clarke figured Nesty , who was from Suriname , must have learned to swim while escaping from the crocodiles in the swamps of his native land . So he wrote his whole story around this amazing feat . Back in London the Daily Mirror headlined Clarke 's report CROC OF GOLD . Alas , the story was a whole other kind of crock . It turns out that Nesty spent his formative years in Florida . " All 's the pity ! " Clarke said last week , fairly keeling over with laughter . " And they are n't crocs in Suriname , but gators. " // Mike Dickson , 28 , the rising star of the Daily Mail , found himself sitting in a car in a rainstorm outside Seles 's Florida home last summer , seeking the answer to the mystery of why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of a peculiar Anglo-Saxon thing , " says Dickson , " the desire to make sense of people , to find the meaning of life , to explain the angst . But as I sat there waiting for Monica , I felt like a complete ass . " // And so down through the years at Wimbledon , the high and mighty have been forced to walk the plank while doubtless experiencing feelings similar to those of Dickson . // Navratilova : HOW MARTINA SMASHED THE SEX BARRIER ( 1983 ) ; MARTINA : I WANT A BABY ( ' 85 ) ; JUDY Nelson , Navratilova 's former companion JUST WANTED TO WATCH TV AND REST HER VARICOSE VEINS ( ' 91 ) . // McEnroe : PITS OF THE WORLD ; THE INCREDIBLE SULK ; THE MERCHANT OF MENACE ; KING SNEER ( all 1981 ) ; I JUST WANT TO BE LOVED SAYS SUPERBRAT ( ' 84 ) ; I NEED HELP TO CURE MY CENTRE COURT INSANITY ( ' 90 ) . // Becker : BORIS : LOVE WILL MAKE ME NUMBER ONE ( 1987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BORIS ( ' 89 ) ; I WANT LOVE NOT SEX ( ' 90 ) . // Obviously there is a thread running somewhere through here , and it does n't have a PG-13 rating . Moreover , last week at Wimbledon , the only shock bigger than No. 1-seeded Jim Courier 's being upset in the third round by 193rd-ranked Andrei Olhovskiy of Russia  --  Olhovskiy learned to play tennis hitting balls through the Kremlin wall , you may not know  --  was the absence from the tabloids of Becker 's newest flame , model Barbara Feltus-Ferbus , or Strapsy Babsy , as the tabloids in Deutschland call her . // In the place of Boris-Babsy bulletins , however , there were : 1 ) TENNIS ACE MICHAEL IN LOVE STICH-UP , explaining how Stich " currently has two beauties in his life . And he has had flings with two others since finding fame as last year 's winner . " 2 ) TENNIS AND SEX DO MIX , a touching report , direct from London 's Hard Rock Cafe , about how Courier had gotten back together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had split after a patch of poor form and after declaring " sex gets in the way of winning .

" And 3 ) POP STAR WIFE IS SECRET GROUPIE , the epic tale of a rock ' n ' roll star 's wife leading a double life  --  as a tennis Annie . " The stunning 38-year-old brunette claims to have slept with a host of top players behind her husband 's back , " reported James Weatherup in News of the World . " And she boasts that one of her conquests , currently seeded at Wimbledon , was only 17 when she bedded him . " // Well , that leaves out Olhovskiy. // Other players have felt the sting of being similarly neglected . " One of my greatest regrets was never to have been linked with anybody in the tabs , " says Pam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant and offered him tickets to Wimbledon . He could n't make it , but if he 'd have sat with me , I would have been all over him to get some pub . My fantasy headline would be six A.M. : CHARLES BIDS PAM GOODBYE AT PALACE . " // Chris Evert has had no such problems . During the eight years she was married to John Lloyd , an Englishman , reporters and photographers trailed Evert everywhere during Wimbledon . " When John and I had our troubles , it was hurtful when they 'd write about all the men I 'd been with , " says Evert . " Once , a headline screamed CHRISSIE LOVE TRIANGLE . The triangle was John , me and my career . " // The seminal moment for the tabs at Wimbledon occurred in 1981 . During a press conference with McEnroe that was going along swimmingly , with Beasties and Rotters screaming questions about Mac 's off-court activities , the man from Reuters spoiled everything by asking him about something innocuous , such as tennis . " Greeaaaat  --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // As shouting suddenly broke out between the serious press and the gossip hounds , McEnroe beat a quick retreat . But he probably regrets to this day that he did not return , because soon Clarke ( would n't you know ? ) and Charlie Steiner of RKO Radio , a non-Beastie , were grappling on the floor trying to strangle each other . Then a mass of journalists joined the fray , bouncing off desks and walls , screaming threats and debating who belonged in the press room and what questions they should ask . // " High noon in Dodge City , " remembers Jamieson , who helped man the battlements , " and one of the great moments in journalism , would n't you say ? " // Ever since then , the beleaguered officials at the All England Club have begun most press conferences with , " Tennis questions only . " Not that the Beasties or Rotters take much notice , of course . Last Friday , because no Royals or sex fiends or any combination thereof had turned up , the tabloids were reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... is your bottom too big ? " and to hearing Seles answer , " You should vote on it .... Honestly , these subjects come from people who have nothing to do all day . " // Hold it just a minute , sister . You can win all the Grand Slam tournaments you want , but if it were n't for my comrades in the vigilant press , the world would little note what Richard Krajicek had to say . Who ? Yeah , Richard Krajicek , the 20-year-old Dutchman with the 129-mph serve , who , after losing in the third round , vented his feelings about the women players , who he said did n't deserve equal prize money because " 80 percent of the women players are fat pigs , and should not be allowed on the show courts . " The headlines fairly sang the next day : WHAT A PORKER , MALE CHAUVINIST PIG and HE 'S A REAL OINK , SAYS MARTINA. // Another tabloid savior , at last ! A player from a Rotter(dam) of a city had turned men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beasties were in heaven as Wimbledon once again went spinning toward tabloid hell .
