If you pray , " Father Martin strikes up his theme for the visit , " something will come . " His words , consonants blunted , blister obscurely within his domed mask . " Pray " might be " play " or " fray , " though probably not . <p> " There 's an old saying , and it 's true , " he continues to harp , " you ca n't get an answer to a question you have n't asked . " <p> There 's a maddening symmetry to everything the priest says . Michael stares blankly at the voice-emitting mask ; the thing is fleshcolored , smooth , a mouth sewn up and healed over . Michael ' s tiring , his mind wanders , even a very short visit tires him out . <p> Father Martin urges Michael to think of this time in his life as a " teething of the spirit . " Is that " teething ? " Or " seething ? " Michael does n't ask him to repeat the word ; either way , it 's way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritualize-has nothing to do with spirit . Far from it : Michael feels he is being sucked into a deep , lightless swamp , a realm of filth and defilement . He 's been incontinent for most of the week , diapered in paper , shitsoaked . Already mired in mud . <p> " I 'm going to leave you with this . " Father Martin places a small book bound in red on the blanket that covers Michael 's diminished lap . It 's a book of psalms , titled in gold . Michael receives it , murmurs his thanks . " Start anywhere , " Father Martin proposes , yet his hand ca n't resist riffling the pages to where a marker already happens to rest . <p> Michael turns his head to stare out the window as the priest leaves . The curtains are partway open onto a sky of brass . Father Martin closes the door carefully behind him . He jiggles the knob to make sure it is solidly shut . <p> Michael fingers the psalter , weighs the thing in one outstretched palm , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies alone in his slot of a bed , the bed in a slot of a room . It 's April , past the middle of the month , moving along . He does n't know the number attached to the day , this particular day , but he 's not out of his mind yet , he can still tell time by the hour : five after three . <p> Alone . There 's an isolation sign on the door-two signs , actually-Michael noticed when he was first wheeled in . He 's in double isolation : Contact and Respiratory , that 's how the warnings read . There 's a small table beside the door to his room , holding protective gear : masks , gloves , gowns , towels , special red plastic disposal bags , and ties . Back in one of his earlier hospitalizations , a nurse tried to smooth things over by explaining to Michael that all these precautions were by way of " reverse isolation-protecting you from contamination by us . " She thought the " reverse " part would soften matters , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like : it comes to the same thing . Gloved and masked , the nurses come and go . A doctor . A priest . The nights are long , phrases haunt him . Gone to his rest . Eternal rest . He 's afraid of sleep , of being stuffed into that sack , of his mind struggling in darkness . <p> For two nights running , the same dream , its meaning so obvious that Michael suspects it is n't a dream at all but one of those mind movies that reels on incessantly , day and night , and tends to be unnoticed in the light . In this dream , or whatever , he 's been thrown overboard . There 's dancing on deck , orange lanterns strung to the rails like fruit on a vine . The water is inky and cold . The boat churns onward , cutting a white wake , carrying away its music and lights . Michael spurts forward , fast as he can , hollering after it . It 's no use-hard as he pumps , the boat always slips out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's eating water , knows he ca n't last . Hears the priest whisper , " bite down on this , " bites , he 's bitinggulps of water-he 's going down <p> Michael has wakened each time , fingers harrowing the sheets as though he 's been swimming in fact . He 's desolate , inconsolable . Thrown overboard-that 's just how it feels , but the part about dancing is strange , his yearning to join them . He does n't dance . Has never wanted to dance . <p> And endured his first , and only , high school dance from the sidelines , splayed against the wall in an exaggerated at-ease , trembling hands clenched behind his back , his bowels churning . Even now , more than a decade later , he can still feel the fear . Battle fear , animal fear-but why ? As if he were being hunted down . The dancing couples , gliding , leaning into one another , blurred before his eyes . He had no desire to join them , only to cut and run . <p> Something-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bloated music , amplified to sweep them away , drowning out every other sound , the perfumes , the fumes of the flowers , all those corsages , choked him . So he 'd fled-rejoicing-first to the lavatory , then to the parking lot , preferring , it seemed , exhaust-fouled air . <p> He ca n't recall ever not feeling " different . " Being studious , for one thing . His way of gazing off into the middle distance when people came too close . Growing up in West Texas with no interest in athletics , hot rods , girls , or guns , he 'd been out of the swim of things for a long time . Then there 'd been that final , isolating , difference , and a secret violent crush on his high school drama teacher-a married man . <p> His parish priest , Father Dennehy , told his parents that perhaps what they had was a young man with a religious calling , and his parents had been willing to consider the possibility ; maybe this was the name of the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as soon as he graduated , shook off the dust of West Texas and headed for the coast . He 'd never had any problems about taking whatever job came up . In his spare time , he started acting in a community theater in Sacramento ; there , he met Thomas , fell in love , came to feel , for the first time ever , not different , not alone . <p> After Thomas went home to Boston to die , Michael had n't the heart to start over . Thomas belonged to one of the " good , old families " ; that 's how Michael 's only letter ( from the sister ) put it . The letter forbade Michael to communicate with Thomas in any way . How was it said ? Thomas would " not be heard back from .... " Something like that . Michael had read the letter only once , then torn it to shreds . Thomas 's sister had been as good as her word the one time Michael had tested her by phoning . Consistent to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsletter , was sent to him weeks after the funeral <p> When his own disease had progressed from " indolent " to " fulminant , " as the doctor so memorably put it , he 'd taken his mother up on her invitation to " come back home . " And so he had come-back to the home he 'd fled , the home he 'd never thought of as home . To his friends in California , he 'd " checked out , " " dropped off the edge of the earth . " Houston , Dallas , even Austin , were charted , on the map of the land of the living-but Amarillo ? The letters and postcards , which followed at first , gradually dried up . Michael had expected this , was n't really surprised . And , anyway , there was no more fight in him . Then came his mother 's stroke , and Michael , no longer ambulatory himself , needed to be cared for professionally , and finally , taken in . <p> Let them vanish like water that runs off/Let them wither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping . <p> The mind movies and dreams keep on coming . Some tease , some frighten . Some have narratives ; some don't-are mere eyefuls , or earfuls . The latest , an urgent one , is only a voice . Whose ? It seems pretty strange to Michael that he ca n't recognize whose voice it is . Maybe the radio announcer on the early morning news , he thinks , that 's one possibility . He has no radio now to check on this . Still-identifying the voice is n't the point-he 's evading the point . The words are what count ; they are clear and distinct : " . or we can just plant you , if you prefer . " <p> Michael does not prefer . No time to waste now ; he 's mucked around long enough . Confess . Receive the sacraments . Plan the funeral . Make whatever peace . <p> Michael has confessed and received absolution according to the rite . He can now receive Communion , but he does n't feel up to it right yet . Nor is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael feels nothing but emptiness , as if his sin had been his last connection to the world . <p> " How do you feel ? " Father Martin wants to know . He talks too much , asks too many questions . It 's as if the mask , by canceling his mouth , compels him to speak . <p> Feel ? In a word ? There is no word . Michael turns his head away and stares out the window , surprised by the sudden ooze of tears . He 's been on drops for days , artificial tears , his eyes so dry , so wept out . <p> There 's weather out there , other side of the glass . Branches wrung by the wind . A wind that is soundless . Father Martin , shattering the silence , starts to say , " I think I know how you feel- " " You do n't and you ca n't ! " Michael lashes back . " Do n't hand me that ! " <p> Father Martin answers softly , " I can understand why you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , and after a short pause , offers another of his texts . " The time of deepest despair is when hope enters us , " he says , " only then are we empty enough . " And then he points to the figure on the wall . Without commentary this time , he simply points . <p> Alone again , Michael eyes the figure on the cross warily ; the little metal Christ suspended there is way too calm . Only the eyeholes in his hands weep . Mostly it 's the prettiness that puts Michael off . The polite drapery , the fig leaf for modesty 's sake-it 's a lie . The nakedness is important , for this particular shame , Michael feels sure of it , was also a wound , not the least of his wounds . Michael turns his face to the door as it opens and shuts . It 's Father Martin , wearing his muzzle . <p> No , he is n't up to being anointed today . Michael feels the priest 's sharp disappointment . That 's why Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has changed its name from " extreme unction " to the " anointing of the sick . " Michael can see that the new name sounds less scary and less final . But , call it what you wish , he is n't ready . " Tomorrow , " he promises . And the funeral-while they 're at it , they 'd better talk about the funeral tomorrow . <p> Father Martin asks about Michael 's prayer life . " Anything happening ? " he probes very gently . Michael shakes his head . He 's reading the psalms , Michael tells him , scanning , tuning in and out . Just wherever a phrase or a line seems to come to life for him . Any other way , he ca n't concentrate at all . " And when it comes to life ? " Father Martin 's voice lifts hopefully . Michael shrugs . He feels like he 's hobbling on his knees toward something , but has no idea what . Then the priest says something that sounds preposterous to Michael : " In your isolation , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only you can unwrap it . " <p> Raving ! <p> You have noted my lamentation/Put my tears into your bottle/Are they not recorded in your book ? <p> Michael tries to pray by moving his lips while reading the psalms . He tries waiting , listening , in silence . Nothing comes . Nothing but the usual : the night nurse , the day nurses , the doctor , mind movies , dreams . And the priest again . <p> Today , Father Martin has brought along a Bible , hymnal , and a book of rites . He opens the book of rites to the rubric Mass of Resurrection . Then he opens the hymnal to the index section . What to sing ? what to say ? are the questions before them . Occasionally , in the past , Michael has thought about such things , but now they are matters of indifference to him . He wo n't be there for it to matter to him . It 's also true that he does n't want to be " just planted " - but if he 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Somehow , it does make a difference . <p> They settle on one of the standard texts , a passage concerning baptism and resurrection in Romans . Michael dwells on the lineDeath has no more power over him . Let it be so . <p> And they pore over the approved list of choices for songs : " O God , Our Help in Ages Past " . . . " The Strife is O'er , the Battle Done " . . " Saints of God , Come to His Aid " . . . What Michael really wants is " Ubi Caritas , " a song he once loved and has n't heard in ages . But there 's bound to be someone ( if anyone comes ) who 'd question the appropriateness of " caritas " in this case . Michael decides not to bring it up . " I leave it to you , " he says , turning the choice over to Father Martin . He simply has n't the energy . <p> They 've actually made a little progress this session . Michael can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still not ready to be anointed . Tomorrow , maybe . Father Martin has brought Holy Communion if Michael wishes to receive it today . Michael does , but asks for only a small piece of the host . " Very small , " he says . Father Martin promises . Removing his right-hand glove , he breaks off a small morsel of consecrated bread for Michael . But the little fragment of host lies heavily on Michael 's tongue while he tries to reconstruct how the act of swallowing is accomplished . Michael blinks and blinks until the ability is restored to him . He had n't realized before now that swallowing was a sacrament as well . Nor how famished he was . <p> Michael 's losing count . His days , as well as his nights , continue ever more shapelessly , unpunctuated by meals or neat alternations of sleeping and waking . There are some regularities : the repeated humiliation of being wiped and washed , diapered and turned , the continuous burbling and swishing of humidifier and fan , the eyedroppered morphine , like clockwork , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departure from routine , an almost-nothing , becomes something : an event . <p> It comes in the small hours of the morning . Long after midnight , anyway-Michael does n't check the clock , he 's too disconcerted , surprised . The phone rings , and Michael , sound asleep for once , shudders into wakefulness . He 's shocked . He gropes for the receiver but , by the time he connects with it , the ringing stops . <p> Minutes later , Michael is n't at all sure of what it was that woke him . Do n't they screen calls here ? They must . He 's not about to ask or complain , though . Surely , it 's a mistake ; he does n't think he 's dreamed it . He places the phone within reach before he allows himself to fall back to sleep . <p> They must have upped the morphine ; Michael drifts off easily and sleeps heavily , sleeps and dreams . No frantic swimming for rescue this time ; if anything , the pace is sluggish . What 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a formal visitor . His night nurse , Nan , opens the door , stands on the threshold , and says : " It 's " a name he does n't catch . <p> Another thing about this dream : it almost allows him to dance . In the dream , Michael is watching the backs of the ushers at church , those backs that had always struck him as so righteously , selfconsciously , rigid . They are bending and straightening now , taking up the collection , guiding the long-poled tithing baskets down the length of the pews . Ploughing the furrows . Reaching , stretching , contracting , returning .... Michael is following one of the backs down the street . Buttocks and back-the man is tall . Cut into the leather of his belt is the name RULF . Now they are in an embrace , Michael and Rulf , rubbing against one another , scraping , abrading . " Should we ? " Rulf whispers . There 's sand in the cracks of his teeth , in the corners of his lips , in the hairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Michael notices , for the first time , that the leaf of his ear is torn <p> Michael knows no one , has never known anyone , who goes by the name of Rulf , nothing even close . Not even a Ralph . The sandy mustache could only be Thomas , though . He does n't have time to ponder this because the phone is ringing again-it 's what awakened him . This time , Michael manages to snatch the receiver to his ear before the cut-off . He presses the speaking end to his mouth but says nothing . From the other end : an answering nothing , a pause of maybe a minute . Then the sound of breathing . The click of disconnection . The dial tone . <p> All too quiet after this . <p> Although there are no further interruptions , Michael has trouble falling back to sleep . He has almost no bodily cushioning now ; lying on his back , even while shifting his weight from buttock to buttock , is becoming actually painful . When he was back at his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tension by touching the wall , walking his fingers up and down the smooth surface , but here at hospice , however far he stretches his arm , he ca n't reach any of the walls . No wonder he feels adrift . Unable to fall back to sleep on his own , Michael presses the call button and asks to be turned . After being turned , he asks for more pain medication . His heart labors , he can hear it . In the enveloping silence , it sounds unnaturally loud . Open your mouth and I will fill it . . . <p> Tuesday . Michael is now making a point of repeating the name and number of the day . April 24 . Sometimes he asks the nurse to write it out for him so he wo n't forget . Today is Tuesday , April 24 , a day without event . Except for when a bird crashes against the window glass and drops . The bird falls silently , not a cheep is heard . Michael ca n't raise himself by himself to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets a nurse to check , she tells him nothing 's fallen , there 's nothing on the ground . <p> Late in the afternoon Father Martin visits . " And how 's the prayer life ? " he asks first thing . " Still trying , " Michael answers . " Maybe you 're trying too hard , " Father Martin says . And , once again , he reflects : " Waiting and listening are also ways- " <p> " Oh , I 'm listening , " Michael puts in . " That 's good , " Father Martin says . He speaks to Michael about God coming in ways you never expect . Michael nods and holds his peace . If God comes in unexpected ways , it does n't follow , and it does n't need a scholastic to tell you , that not everything coming to you in ways you do n't expect is from God . <p> Except for the nurses , Father Martin is the only person to enter Michael 's room today . Today , Tuesday , April 24 . Michael 's shaky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all his news for the day , should anyone ask . <p> Before settling for the night , Michael places the phone on his bed , within easy reach . There are no calls . He sleeps more soundly than the night before but wakes in a darker mood . Clearly , the calls of last night were a wrong number , a mistake that 's now been corrected . <p> Wednesday . April 25 . The lady in the red shoes visits . Joann , is it ? He keeps misplacing her name . Sharon and Terry , the day nurses , come and go . Dr. Danner . Father Martin does n't show , and there are no calls that night . Michael has placed the phone back on the bedtable , but he keeps the bedtable close , in case . <p> Nothing . Or , wait-a little something . Twice . Just this : the sound of tires being scrubbed on a too-tight curve , then a car horn . Somebody leaning on the horn . Or maybe it 's stuck . Michael 's never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No words from the outside until now . These are n't really words , though , he has to remind himself . <p> Michael pushes the call button for the night nurse ; he needs a change of position . By grabbing a bed rail , and by leaning and pulling on it , he 's pleased to be able to assist Nan in turning him without her having to call another nurse for assistance . Soon after Nan leaves , though , he feels like he 's been parked and left on the side of a hill . He 's so uncomfortable that he has to ring for her again . His pillow is drenched with sweat . <p> Thursday . April 26 . Michael is anointed . Father Martin peels off his right glove to apply the consecrated oil . Michael stares out the window afterwards : the sky today like flint . A telephone cable stretches from the outer wall above his window to some point beyond the frame . Within the frame : A web of tree branches . Bench . Bird feeder . Gate . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's conscious of each breath he draws-it 's short of what he needs . Night . He waits the darkness through . Saliva thickens , a sludge , in his throat . He swallows , coughs , swallows-if he stops coughing , he 's afraid he 'll forget how to swallow . If he does n't swallow , how will he breathe ? <p> But Michael does breathe , and the phone catches him sleeping . He lifts the receiver on the third ring , before the caller has time to hang up . He 's greeted by silence . Enough of this tease ! - he blurts out : " Hello . Hello ? Who 's there ? " <p> Nothing answers at first . Then , something : a rustling of cloth , followed by the heavy suggestive breathing of an obscene caller . Michael repeats his question : " Who are you ? " Is answered by the click of disconnection , the dial tone . He uses his remote to switch on the wall light and check the time . A few minutes after two . Michael does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number misdialed , a mischievous operator ? A sick joke ? Or part of a dream ? Maybe the sound he was hearing was the sound of his own breathing amplified . Maybe the dream was a way of telling him that he was having trouble breathing and had better wake up and raise his head . Could be that he 'd started to wake with his calling out : " Hello . Who is it ? " , that the dream scrambled the sequence , so that what he was doing was waking ( in the dream ) , lifting the phantom receiver , and hearing phantom sounds ( or his own breathing , distanced ) , and then waking for real . Whatever-the simple fact that he can analyze the possibilities reassures Michael that his mind is still clear . <p> But-two in the morning ! He was sleeping before , and now he does n't think he 'll be able to drift off again . He lies on his back , making a tent of the sheet with his raised knees . The bony knobs of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it 's wasted , thigh and calf now seem to be nearly the same thickness . He is all bone . <p> Nothing to be done but stare up at the darkness . But even the darkness is unstable , drifting and flecked . Michael considers ringing for more Ativan to calm him , but thinks , no , I 've got to get a handle on this , on my own , the panic is in my mind . It 's as if someone 's turned up the amplification everywhere : he 's acutely aware of the ticking of the clock , the burbling of the humidifier , the beating of his heart . He imagines he can actually hear the incessant small circlings of his mind , like a broom sweeping . ... <p> They 've upped the morphine even more . Morning passes . Evening , another day . Saturday . Michael is restless , suffering from severe air hunger again . He 's drowsing , though , when Father Martin stops by . Father Martin blesses him , tiptoes out . Michael wakes at the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after midnight . It 's the heavy breather , and already the joke is heavy , stale , it 's been going on for too long . It sounds like the breather is practicing scales , scaling a ladder of breaths . The ladder is steep . Michael does n't attempt to speakwould n't know what to reply , even if he did have breath enough to spare for it . It 's a revelation to him how much breath the act of speaking requires . First , enough to form a bolus , from which the word is carved , then the favoring wind . Even if Michael were able to bring up the first breath shaping the word , he could n't summon the added breath needed to launch it . <p> Another call comes after two . The same practical joker , Michael is sure of it , the same tired old joke-why bother to pick it up ? But he does pick it up , and it is n't the same . <p> What he hears is a pulse , the sound of compression and release . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of carrion birds , converging . Then he recognizes what it is : the throbbing surge of the telephone cable itself , the dense humming of many voices interwoven in one . It 's a sound he remembers from the months before he first left home , walking down country roads with open fields on either side , the cable , stretched high overhead . He was so restless , he could n't wait to be gone from West Texas , he was ready to go . That humming was a promise , pulsing the air with secrets it was n't yet telling , bound for elsewhere , where he , too , was goingMorning comes swiftly . <p> His head does not turn when the priest enters . Father Martin finds Michael lying on his back and leaning a little to one side . He bends over the bed , searching Michael 's unshut eyes for expression , for any sign of meeting , sorrow , protest , or surprise . Nothing-the shine is gone . Nothing but the usual , utterly mysterious , face of the newly dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anybody 's guess . <p> Father Martin prays his goodbye and Godspeed . Lord , remember him in your kingdom . . . Then continues to stand at the side of the bed , saying nothing at all . Touches his hand to Michael 's forearm and rests it there . Not yet cool : through the thin film of rubber , he can still feel the fever . <p> Shutting the door carefully behind him on his way out , a line from Philippians comes mockingly to mind : Remember to close the gates . <p> Father Martin pauses at the utility table . Absently , pushes the flesh-colored mask up over his nose and eyes , where it sits on his brow like a tumor or an extra forehead . He opens one of the folded disposal bags . Neatly peels off left glove , right glove . Recollects the mask and plucks that off , roughing up his hair in the process . Ties the disposal bag tight and drops it into the lined container provided . Glances back once , questioningly , over his shoulder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he makes his way on down the hall to the nurses ' station . <p> He finds Vinnie all by herself at the desk . She takes one glance at his face before saying , " I think I know what you 're going to say , Father , " before he 's had time to get a word out . " You have to understand what kind of night it 's been . Two new admissions late yesterday afternoon , a death just before the early morning shift came on . And now , Michael- " <p> She pages Michael 's nurse on the intercom . Words are exchanged-blurted , really . Then she turns back to Father Martin : " Sharon 's on her way . She 'll pronounce him . We 're short-staffed today on top of everything else . It 's hard to be-just a sec- " As if to prove her point , the phone and the intercom start shrilling at the same minute . Father Martin stares blankly at the clergy sign-in book until Vinnie 's free to turn back to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Michael , " Father Martin says . " It 's a mercy , really , " Vinnie says . Father Martin does n't dispute this . <p> " He had a restless night . More restless than usual , I should say ; he 's never been what you 'd call peaceful . And , " Vinnie adds , " we knew he was active , but we did n't know how long-But the strange thing was-when Nan went in about three in the morning to check on him , she found him sound asleep and clutching the phone . I ca n't think who could have been calling-we 've got a very short list of names for him and none of them ever got in touch . I 've seen a few dying alone-mostly old ones-never anybody so young . Nan said he was holding the receiver to his chest . Like a bouquet , ' she said , like he was showing off something precious he 'd just been given , ' and she had all she could do to pry it loose from his grasp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
