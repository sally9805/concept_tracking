In The Tale of Genji ( a work of narrative fiction written in the eleventh century by Murasaki Shikibu , a lady of the Japanese imperial court ) , a nobleman spies on a princess and her ladies-in-waiting . Only semidressed in nearly transparent underrobes , they struggle with a block of ice on a sweltering summer 's day : Making a great effort , they managed to break it . Each took a piece in her hand . Some even behaved quite vulgarly , placing it on their heads or holding it to their breasts . Another wrapped a bit in paper and presented it this way to the princess , but she held out her very lovely hands and let her wipe them . " No , I 'd better not take it , " she said , " the dripping is a bother . " The peeping courtier must be rather warm , in his voluminous , layered court robes , but watching the young ladies distracts him from the heat . This is one key to tolerating , even savoring , summer in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A garden  --  even a pocket-sized one  --  provides a vision of the forest in the deep green of moss and water caught in a stone basin or trickling over rocks . A cast-iron wind bell hangs in a doorway , a slip of stiff paper dangling from the clapper to catch the slightest breeze . While the streets are still gray with the dawn , Japanese householders and shopkeepers emerge carrying pails of water and dippers , sloshing cool water over the stones or asphalt outside . The dampened surface offers a sense of coolness to the eye , and as the water evaporates , it mitigates the day 's rapidly rising heat . In summer , the owners of old shops and inns or large homes with impressive entranceways take down the dark cotton noren curtains that hang in the doorway the rest of the year . They put up others made of crisp , gauzy hemp or other bast fiber  --  often light in color  --  that move gently in an otherwise imperceptible breeze . A sink outside the toilet in an elegant inn or restaurant might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves : not only the color but also the sound of water splashing on the leaves suggest coolness . Except in the less-populated mountains and northerly regions , summer in Japan is unrelenting , with warm , humid nights following sultry days . A glass of chilled barley tea , a neatly folded hand towel or handkerchief for wiping off sweat , and a pristine paper fan are the indispensable tools for keeping cool . Even in cosmopolitan Tokyo , a man may be seen standing on a train platform at the end of a hot day , an attache case by his side and his coat slung over his arm , irritably fanning himself and mopping his brow . Originally made of cypress slats , the folding fan ( sensu ) is often claimed as a Japanese invention , exported to China as early as the seventh century . Whether a plain white paper fan inscribed in the hand of a famous Buddhist priest , a mourning fan covered in smoky silver leaf with black lacquered ribs , or a fan of colored paper painted with an autumnal landscape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its breeze . The rigid fan , known as uchiwa in Japan , is of Chinese derivation . In Ozu Yasujir 's classic film Tokyo Story , the elderly mother , after an exhausting day in the city , lies on her futon with her eyes closed . In one hand she holds an uchiwa , fanning herself even after she appears to have fallen sound asleep . Less often carried out of doors , the uchiwa becomes part of the decor of a summer room . At summer festivals , however , when both men and women sport soft , blue-and-white cotton yukata robes , it is tucked into the obi , or broad sash , just under the knot at the small of the back , from where it can be retrieved as the need arises . Japanese-style summer clothing incorporates special fabrics that stand stiffly away from the body , allowing the air to circulate . These displace the warmer cottons and tightly woven silks of the cooler months . Bast fiber taken from the inner surface of the bark of the ramie plant , a commercially cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retains strong associations with Japan 's Snow Country . Woven in wintertime into a fine , translucent cloth in Niigata Prefecture ( formerly the province of Echigo ) , it is traditionally bleached on top of the snow in the brilliant sunshine of early spring . As actually worn by a woman , however , a fine Echigo kimono loses much of its coolness . Underneath she encases herself in at least one additional layer of underkimono ( plus Western-style bra and underpants these days ) , firmly wrapped around the body and tied with a separate cord . The kimono itself is sashed with a stiff obi that barely lets the wearer breathe . Even a filmy silk crepe or georgette kimono is worn the same way , creating an inviting but deceptive image of coolness . Little wonder most Japanese women avoid such dress , especially in summer , except for special occasions ( weddings , funerals ) and for performing the tea ceremony , traditional dance , and other arts . Men have an easier time of it . They not only wear less but they also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric that absorbs perspiration and lets the air pass through it . On summer nights , men freely go out into the streets wearing only their underwear or loosely wrapped in a ramie kimono tied with a soft sash . Like other peoples , the Japanese have their special summer foods and drinks . Ice , preserved in chambers cut into a mountainside or into the ground , was a summer luxury enjoyed by members of the eleventh-century imperial court . Sei Shonagon , an attendant who recorded her observations and personal reflections , lists , among other " Elegant Things , " " shaved ice mixed with liana synp and put in a new silver bowl " ( The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon , translated by Ivan Morris ) . Shaved ice remains a typical Japanese refreshment , these days sweetened with flavored syrups , condensed milk , or the green , thick tea of the tea ceremony ( chilled before pouring over the ice ) , and topped with sweet azuki beans . Just as important as real ice is the appearance of ice : frosted-glass bowls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sweets served with the tea of the tea ceremony ( which is sometimes whisked up in a tea bowl and poured into a glass over ice ) look like ice or chilled water : a colorless glassy , seaweed-based gelatin , ice-cube shaped , contains a miniature goldfish made of sugar ; a transparent yellow jelly , its sweetness offset by a single fermented black bean , is contained in a delicately patterned brown-and-white clamshell ; translucent , opaline noodles made of arrowroot starch ( for dipping in a brown-sugar syrup ) nestle among chunks of crystal clear ice in a black lacquer bowl . Summer outings have long been a favorite Japanese way of cooling off . Eighteenth-century woodblock prints depict the citizenry of Edo ( now Tokyo ) and Kyoto , dressed in sheer kimonos and fanning themselves , seeking the cool of the evening by crowding onto the arching wooden bridges over the Sumida and Kamo rivers . Often the night sky behind them is lit up with fireworks . A more effective excursion was a trip to Kifune in the hills north of Kyoto ( even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee shop ) . In a cool gorge rising from the banks of a clear-running river , platforms are set out only inches above the water from June until September . There diners enjoy white , threadlike noodles called somen , served over clear chunks of ice in a glass bowl . Sunlight filters through screens of golden reeds , set up to shield guests from the blazing sun and the stares of passersby . Many urban Japanese ( the overwhelming majority of Japan 's population ) live and work in steel-and-concrete buildings with central air conditioning . But those who can afford to build a house , and those who live in rural parts of the country , adhere to a more ancient life style that follows the changing seasons . " A Japanese house should be built with summer in mind . In winter it is possible to live anywhere , but a badly made house is unbearable when it gets hot , " wrote the Buddhist priest Yoshida Kenko more than 650 years ago ( Essays in Idleness , translated by Donald Keene ) . The main living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south , to be warmed by direct sunshine in winter . This alignment also insures that in summer the same rooms will be shaded much of the morning and evening , while in the heat of noon they are protected by deeply overhanging eaves . Tile-roofed houses with thin , lath-and-plaster walls , sliding glass doors , and wood or metal rain shutters do little to keep out the damp cold during the winter months . But in mid-July , when the rainy season comes to an end and the full blast of summer 's heat hits city and country dweller alike , the Japanese house takes on a summery aspect . The sliding glass doors ( translucent paper in past centuries ) and the heavy paper sliding partitions ( fusuma ) that separate one room from another can be pushed wide open or even removed . The impermeable winter fusuma may be replaced by others made of thin reeds , which provide a sense of privacy while allowing breezes to pass from one room to the next . Warm straw tatami matting is covered with pale blond , sleek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the touch . Cushions covered with heavy silk or warm cotton are stored away , replaced with thinner ones covered in porous , woven straw or crisp hemp , ramie , or exotic banana fiber cloth from subtropical Okinawa , Japan 's southernmost prefecture . Blinds of aged bamboo , bark-covered wisteria , or reeds are hung from the eaves to provide a modicum of privacy and break any intensive sunshine into striped shade . At night , however , when everyone is fast asleep and oblivious to artifice , every door and window is firmly closed and bolted ; the outer rain shutters are shut as well , allowing not a breath of night air to penetrate the rooms ( but ample space for mosquitoes to find their way in ) . Mosquito nets , still used in some country houses , add yet another layer of suffocating obstacles to passing breezes . Fear of the night air appears to be a recent invention . Nearly a thousand years ago , activities at the imperial court often continued through the night . In describing her favorite time of day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights . Not only when the moon shines , but on dark nights too , as the fireflies flit to and fro , and even when it rains , how beautiful it is ! " During the hot months , " she also noted , " it is a great delight to sit on the veranda , enjoying the cool of the evening and observing the outlines of objects gradually become blurred .
