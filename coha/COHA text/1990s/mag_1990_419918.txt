The unappropriated lands of the BLM embrace an uncelebrated richness of biological diversity . <p> I watch  --  quietly , but not quietly enough  --  as a mule deer drinks at the edge of Burro Creek , then jerks its head up in alarm water dripping from its muzzle . The deer turns and leaps in one fluid motion , disappearing into the maze of mesquites that border this stretch of stream . It is spring in central Arizona and the mesquite bosque is life itself . Fresh green leaves of the year cover every tree . Long yellow catkins dangle from branch tips like overgrown woolly bear caterpillars . The catkins swarm with minute yellow bees that are dwarfed by an occasional honey bee for ager . Lucy 's warblers sing with territorial determination , having converted the bosque into a warbler subdivision . Their songs rise and fall from every point along the stream even though the pale silver-gray singers remail hidden within the canopy of the trees . A phainopepla flutters toward a clump of mistletoe " rowing parasitically from the limb of a mesquite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the filtered light of/the trees . The mistletoe still has a few small pink berries left for the bird to harvest . In the bottom of a deep pool three fat round-tail chubs over a foot long skulk in the shade created by a rock wall and a cottonwood bordering the stream . The chunky fish are on the threatened species list for the state of Arizona and in decline throughout their range , bat they are doing well for the moment in Burro Creek . . . <p> Burro Creek is a kind of paradigm : just one of thousands of examples that could be drawn from the western United States to make the point that deserts are far more complex than the stereotyped image of a bleak , grey wasteland pimpled with and dunes and creased with waterless arroyos  --  places that hardly anybody lives in or cares about . <p> Much of the desert terrain in North America falls under the control of the Bureau of Land Management . The BLM manages millions of acres in the Sonoran Desert of southern Arizona , the Mojave Desert of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New Mexico , and the Great Basin Desert that embraces most of Nevada and portions of Utah , Idaho , Oregon , and California . These regions are difficult and hostile places for humans but are home to a surprisingly diverse array of organisms , including many that are found nowhere else . <p> Each one of our western deserts has its own distinctive features and characteristic assemblages of plants and animals . The Sonoran Desert boasts the most diverse collection of cacti of the North American deserts . Here and only here can you find the giant saguaros and the columnar organ pipe cactus , for example . The Mojave Desert has far fewer cacti and desert trees than the Sonoran but it has its own specialties and the unique flavor conferred on it by its Joshua trees , huge furry yuccas that dominate the landscape of the Mojave in the same wonderful way that saguaros claim dominion over the Sonoran Desert . The Great Basin is the most northern of the American deserts and the coldest . Its serene plains are covered by sagebrush and saltbush  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drought-tolerant shrubs and succulents , like sotols , yuccas , agaves , and acacias , which mingle with desert grasses in the plains and plateaus of New Mexico . <p> Although it is possible to characterize each desert by the presence of a few key plant species , these thumbnail sketches do not begin to do justice to the diversity of life that exists within their boundaries . Even in one small corner of a western desert , there can be astonishing differences in the plants and animals found within a few acres . Burro Creek offers a case in point . In the narrow riparian corridor running along the stream , mesquite bosques , cottonwoods , and willows shelter and feed Lucy 's warblers , and common black-hawks , the last a candidate for the threatened species list in Arizona . But move several hundred yards away from the watercourse and you are in dramatically different world . Here , the mesquites give way to little creosote bushes with their spindly limbs and minimalist leaves . Thorny acacias pull at trousers and pluck at sleeves . In a narrow dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not move . On the boulder-strewn hillsides , agaves point their needle-tipped leaves to the sky and the twisted green limbs of foothill palo verdes bask in the penetrating sunlight It is a place that grunting white-collared peccaries find amenable . <p> Travel north along Burro Creek to the upper watershed and you enter another very different habitat , a block of semidesert grassland , with its own special congregation of plant and animal occupants . This spartan prairie supports a population of pronghorn antelope , the Burro Creek part of a Chihuahuan subspecies which has been reduced to a fraction of its original numbers . Semidesert grasslands like these are dominated by species of grass that can manage on/just 10 to 15 inches of rain a year . Although native species of grass have largely been replaced in central Arizona by introduced species that cope better with cattle grazing , a few native inhabitants such as/Arizona cottontop , black grama , and sideoats grama grass persist in places The semidesert grasslands on Burro Mesa run off into the distance largely unblemished by scruffy mesquites and juniper thickets . Tufts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wind that rush over the plateau , and prairie falcons and Say 's phoebe grace the sky . <p> This is beautiful country and much of its beauty and value lies in the variety species that the land sustains . A great deal I has been said , recently about the importance of biological diversity by/biologists and conservationists who have been made keenly aware that an appreciation of diversity for diversity 's sake is not universal . Many Americans are emphatic that the value of living things and natural habitats is proportional to their potential contribution to economic / gain or utility for off-road vehicle recreation . <p> Admirers of biological diversity have worked hard to counter this utilitarian view . By maintaining as many species as possible , they say , we protect organisms that might eventually prove to have some special , but now unknown , benefit for mankind ( a cancer cure is a favorite for persons employing this argument ) . Or , they maintain , given the subtle interactions among species , the loss of even one apparently insignificant species may have unexpected ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while studies of desert plants , they say , might help to expand future desert agriculture . <p> All these claims are probably correct , but the biologists that I know present them without much enthusiasm , probably because they are based on the utilitarian premise that the universe revolves around human beings and their economic goals . Many of us , however , value biological diversity simply because of the pure aesthetic appeal of natural differences . I just like the idea of the Death Valley M , 6rmon tea , for instance , a plant not terribly different from other Mormon teas but not exactly the same either . Or what about the balloon vine , a species found in the United States only in the Coyote Mountain , , s of Arizona ? I have never seen the plant but it gives me pleasure to know that it is out there somewhere . Each plant and animal species has ifs unique features and unique puzzles to solve . There are volumes of genetic information contained in the tissues that make up a balloon vine Joshua tree or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along a stream in the Desert offers a continual array c ' surprises and questions that could never be asked in the absence of these species . A world from which mesquite bosques had been removed , /would be a monochrome world deprived of Lucy 's warblers and the Perdita bees that depend on mesquite pollen . It would be a world from which a whole raft of delicious complexities and untold stories would have disappeared , a world in which the possibilities for curiosity had I been diminished . <p> And this is where the BLM and the concept of wilderness areas have their part to play . Burro Creek and the coyote Mountains of Arizona are in the BLM empire as are the Henry mountains and the Dirty Devil River canyons of Utah , the King Rangeand the New York Mountains of California , the Owyhee Plateau of Idaho , the Black Rock Desert of Nevada , the Centennial Mountains of Montana , and thousands of other sites , not all of them desert , but all of them irreplaceable . As part of the Federal Land Policy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider all roadless tracts in excess of 5,000 acres to find those that offered outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive recreation . <p> The BLM 's ultimate charge was to recommend to the Congress via the President and Secretary of the Interior those lands that it deemed suitable additions for the National wilderness Preservation System . In Arizona , for example , the BLM firs identified several million acres as possible wilderness study sites , i eluding two blocks along Burro Creek . Then , after environmental i pact studies had been completed , the BLM informed Congress that in heir view only about 1 million acres actually deserved wilderness status  --  and only one 20,000-acre block along Burro Creek made the final grade . <p> Intense resistance to placing more e than a small fraction of BLM lands in wilderness has greeted all attempts to enlarge the agency 's recommendations in the West . Ranchers miners , off-road recreationists and other elements of the anti-wilderness crowd have fought to restrict the amount of BLM land that would e placed in designated wilderness . Wilderness proponents , for their part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and legislation to that effect is now pending in Arizona , California , and Utah , while conservationists in Oregon , Nevada , and New Mexico are sharpening their own knives for battle . <p> The fight is both predictable and necessary . As the photographs in " Of Brittlebush and Bobcats " demonstrate , the simple fact is that the BLM manages desert lands that contain a vase array plane and animal species that would benefit greatly from wilderness designation . Plants like the Panamint liveforever , Stephen 's beardtongue , Eureka dune-grass , and the Mimbres figwort . Animals like peregrine and prairie falcons , Sanborn 's long-nosed bees , fringe-toed lizards , and the Yuma clapper rail . Many plants and animals in the BLM 's care are scarce or endangered , highly localized in their distribution , and sensitive to human activities . <p> Thus , whether it appreciates it or not the BLM has the opportunity to be a kind of zoological and botanical librarian shepherding a legion of unusual desert-competent organisms into the twenty-first century so that their stories can be read in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps we should be more emphatic . The BLM has the responsibility to be a guardian of the wealth of biological diversity that exists in all the lands that it manages for all Americans . <p> Burro Creek , Arizona . January 1990 . While politicians , stockmen , miners , ORV enthusiasts , and wilderness advocates argue over what should and should not be included a in the Arizona wilderness bill , I visit this small wilderness world again . The mesquite bosques are grown and leafless , looking for all the world like a dead forest . It is really only on hold , I know , still waiting for winter rains . If the rains do come , returning Lucy 's warblers will find the mesquites Decked out in green spring canopies , offering shelter , food , and safe song perches galore . The drought that has hit the Southwest has reduced Burro Creek ' in some places to shallow , scattered pools maintained by Beavers , an unlikely desert mammal , but one thoroughly at home in the creek . The beaver dams may be only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many desert visitors . A flock of American wigeons explodes from a sheltered cover and a great blue heron lumbers after them . A black phoebe accompanies me upstream leaping exuberantly into the air from rocks in the stream after small midges dancing in the sunshine . A castanet click of its beak announces each attempt to snare a midge . From its perch on boulders set among a sparse forest of saguaros , a bald eagle leaps into space and calmly strokes away well above the creek bed . As it passes over a perfectly still pool , the mirror image of the eagle travels across the water 's surface , wingbeat matching wingbeat for a few glorious moments . <p> Watching , I reflect that the very real possibility of losing some elements of the diverse natural world is as aesthetically repellant to some of us as would be disappearance of all Picassos or Pollocks or Renoirs . To be told that the art of Manet would suffice of all Monets would hardly satisfy lovers of art . <p> " It 's amazing what happens to a place if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The O-Zone . " It just goes its own way . It stays alive . It grows . It gets better .
