He 's the collector . She 's the editor . Put their mutual vintage finds together and you 've got . . . // Charlie Mackaman is naturally creative with tight spaces . As a greeting card designer , he 's a whiz at handling 5- x 7-inch challenges . Beth Stoner has used her 20 years in the cosmetic industry to develop a refined sense of color . Together , they 've put a unique stamp on their 1,200-square-foot cottage . Charlie and Beth think big , however , when scavenging items for the compact space they call home . Avid travelers and collectors , they often bring room-size souvenirs-from antiques to flea market finds-to their home in the West Plaza neighborhood of Kansas City , Missouri . Exposed beams and walls of cutcedar siding in a fresh coat of white make a great backdrop for their treasures . " We 've traveled to Santa Fe ; Fredericksburg , Texas ; and Rocheport , Missouri , collecting items we love , " says Charlie . " We also enjoy going to flea markets and antiques malls right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , " adds Beth , " we 'll find a place for it : " If you 're thinking , " Gee , they must have enough furniture for two houses , " you 're right . When temperatures begin to dip this fall , Beth and Charlie will replace summery striped slipcovers and accessories with warmer toned fabrics , kilim rugs , and seasonal accessories of gourds , antlers , and pinecones . " If you do n't want a cluttered look yet you want to live surrounded by the things you love , you need a second season , " says Charlie . Because storage can be a problem , every large piece of fumiture they buy has to be able to hold things . The trunk and crate in the living room , for example , both conceal out-of-season items . " It 's not as much trouble as it sounds , " says Charlie . " Changing our slipcovers gives us twice the wear we 'd get if we used them year-round . " Photograph ABOVE : The headboard from an old Jenny Lind bed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tough to find good-looking , affordable fabrics , " says Beth . " When we first bought the house , we were spending too much on fabric and slipcovers . I solved the problem by buying Charlie a sewing machine as an early Christmas present that year . " " As a creative exercise , I taught myself to make slipcovers , " explains Charlie . " We were tired of not being able to find good-looking fabrics . One day we saw a pattern we loved on a duvet cover in a department store , and thought , Why not ? ' So I bought two covers and used them as slipcover fabric . It worked beautifully . On the other hand , though , we learned the hard way that you ca n't make upholstery fabric out of old rag rugs . " Our favorite room is probably the living room , " he continues . " Barry Miller was the original designer , and his airy , whitewashed look sold us on the house . " We love the summer light that pours in the windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the open twostory construction with our loft . " " Charlie 's a collector , but I like simpler things , " adds Beth . " And I love using things from nature , such as shells in the summer and bird feathers and nests and pods during the winter . We 've used five shades of green in this house . If it works in nature , it can work for you . " So , if he likes to add things and she likes to subtract , what 's their secret to decorating in harmony ? " We make decisions together , " says Charlie . " I do like to put more in , and Beth is into editing out . She has a great color sense and helps select our color schemes . And she 's more tailored . " And , just like one of Charlie 's greeting cards , you get their decorating message . " We both love a room designed for comfort , beauty , and our favorite things .

" Our whitewashed siding walls called for a relaxed , casual look . Then add a big piece of furniture you ca n't live without . " * " Do n't run around with a paint or fabric swatch looking for exact matches . Buy what you love , instead . " * Do n't be in a hurry ; let a room evolve . " If you do n't like a chair or sofa , add a slipcover till you find a better one . " * Keep your eyes open when you travel . " Travel with a partner so you can make shopping decisions together . " * " Magazines bring the world to you . Use them to develop your eye .
