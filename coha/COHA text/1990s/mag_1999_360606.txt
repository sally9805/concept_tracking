Last week the state of Oklahoma killed SEAN SELLERS . He was the first person in 40 years executed for a crime committed at age 16 , and the 10th juvenile offender executed in the U.S. this decade , more than in Saudi Arabia , Nigeria , Pakistan and Iran  --  the only other countries that are known to execute child offenders  --  combined . <P> Not only was he a child offender ; Sean also suffered from a mental disorder . He was tried for three murders that took place in 1985 and ' 86 : his mother Vonda , his stepfather Paul Bellofatto and Robert Bower . At trial , the jury was unaware that he suffered from multiple-personality disorder . Three mental-health experts established that Sean had severe brain damage as a result of an injury as a child . The U.S. Court of Appeal , noting that M.P.D. was " virtually unknown at the time of Sellers ' trial , " stated that his " illness is such that he may be able to prove his factual innocence . " But the federal court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep remorse about his crime . He ministered to thousands of teenagers to help them find the right path . His execution denies the possibility that a person  --  a child of 16  --  can be rehabilitated and redeemed . It is the potential for change and redemption that motivates us all to be better people . Killing the light of that redemption in Sean has killed some of that light in all of us . <P>  --  By Bianca Jagger
