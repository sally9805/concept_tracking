<p> ON a hot August night in 1988 , 400 New York City police clashed with demonstrators for six hours in a melee that spread through the lower east side of Manhattan . <p> The skirmishes brought filings of complaints of 143 separate acts of abuse and brutality before the police department 's Civilian Complaint Review Board ( CCRB ) . Nearly three years later , some 14 officers have been found guilty of various offenses , and a half dozen others still await decision . <p> " The system did n't work , " says the New York Civil Liberties Union . <p> " We feel the board does work , " says New York police officer Robert Vilches . <p> " It would have been much worse without us , " says Mary Burke Nicholas , CCRB chairperson . <p> From these " Tompkins Square Riots " to the homicide charges against five New York Policeman last week to the case of Los Angeles construction worker Rodney King , comes the enduring question : Who polices the police ? <p> The answer , increasingly , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1983 and in 70 smaller towns over two decades , popular outrage has metamor-phosed into what some call an equally unwieldy monster - the citizen review board . Its purpose is to turn the searchlight back into the precinct house . <p> In addition have come new efforts to examine police training , recruitment , and procedure . Integration of minorities into departments has also been a major focus , which experts say can be a powerful internal check on police abuse . <p> More than anything , however , experts say the key to curbing police misconduct lies in the tone set at the top - the central reason so much nationwide attention has focused on Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates . <p> " All of these are just pieces of the puzzle , " says Sam Walker , a criminologist at the University of Nebraska . " Each is essential for a truly accountable police structure that keeps itself out of problems . " <p> Interest in civilian review boards , which grew out of the civil-rights movement of the 1960s , mushroomed in the 1980s as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public pocketbook . Litigation and victim settlements cost time and money . <p> Though half of the nation 's largest cities have such boards , several experts contend most are toothless - " public relations fronts for police departments , " as Mr. Walker puts it . <p> To be effective , some scholars and police watchdog groups argue that complaint investigations should be handled entirely by civilians and that a nonpolice board or administrator review the probe and make recommendations for disciplinary action . <p> They maintain that probes conducted part-ly or fully by police - even if reviewed by civilians - are n't impartial . <p> In a 50-city survey , Mr. Walker identified Detroit , New Orleans , Washington , D.C. , Cincinnati , and Baltimore as having the most independent boards . Omaha , Neb. , and Phoenix are among the least independent . <p> Even civilian panels have problems , though : They 're frequently underfunded and understaffed - and many police do n't like them . <p> " Lawyers are judged by lawyers , doctors by doctors . We should be judged by our peers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police union representative . <p> " What we need are competent , professional civilian oversight mechanisms rather than merely representative ones , " says Jerome Skolnick , a police expert at the University of California at Berkeley . <p> In Los Angeles , the civilian Police Commission that oversees the department has the power to take part in misconduct investigations , but critics say it has n't done so in the past . <p> Some want the panel beefed up so it can play a more activist role ; one local watchdog group even suggests appointing a special prosecutor . Recently reconstituted , the commission has moved quickly to look into the King beating . <p> Other ideas on the blotter to check police misconduct : <p> Training and recruitment . Experts say there is a need for tighter screening of the people police departments hire to winnow out those who might be prone to violence or harbor ethnic stereotypes . Psychological testing - one method of doing it - is costly and controversial , however . " What kind of guy wants to wear a 20-pound belt of bullets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elliot , a criminologist at Trinity University in San Antonio . " By definition , you attract a personality predisposed to power and action . " <p> Once in the academy , many of today 's recruits are given several hours of " cultural awareness " training to enhance sensitivity to ethnic differences and other behavior they will encounter on the street . Some experts would like to see this kind of schooling increased and continued throughout an officer 's career . <p> Cities such as Miami are sending all members of the force through such courses . <p> Part of San Francisco 's core curriculum is to bring in gays , lesbians , blacks , and the homeless to talk to police . In line with a California law passed last year , the visitors interact with recruits in the field and prepare videotapes for senior officers . <p> " Certainly cops need nuts and bolts on the law , " says John Crew , director of the Police Practices Project , a San Francisco advocacy group . " But they also need some feeling for the communities into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits to tutorials . " It 's pretty tough to change attitudes in four to six hours , " says Cassandra Johnson , head of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives . <p> Integration . Departments have made uneven progress in putting blacks , Hispanics , and other minorities in blue . Nudged by federal affirmative-action laws , police are doing better than many other American institutions , experts say , but some cities lag behind and not enough is being done to put minorities in top positions . <p> In a study of departments in the 50 largest US cities , the University of Nebraska 's Walker found that 45 percent made " significant " progress between 1983 and 1988 in hiring black officers , while 17 percent reported a decline . Figures for Hispanics were similar : 42 percent increased , 11 percent declined . The number of women wearing badges is up nationwide . <p> Detroit , Atlanta , and Washington are among the best , the study says , while Cleveland , New York , and Baltimore are among the worst . Los Angeles has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population at large , but fewer Hispanics . <p> " The L.A. beating is as good a case imaginable for the further integration of police departments , " Mr. Elliot says , noting that a black presence among the white officers at the King beating may have mitigated it . Mr. King , a black , was beaten by a group of white officers in Los Angeles March 3 . <p> Chief Gates said recently : " I 've hired more blacks ... Hispanics ... women than any other chief in the history of the LAPD . " <p> Leadership . Experts concur that the moral and professional tone set at the top is of paramount importance in curbing excessive force . <p> In a culture as closed as the police , department brass not only determines day-to-day behavior but influences the kind of officers a force attracts . <p> To help foster the right atmosphere , many departments ( among them Madison , Wis. , and Houston , Tex. ) have adopted explicit " value statements " guiding police behavior . <p> The old rules of conduct - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being replaced by policies that take into account community needs and human values . <p> As David Bayley , a New York criminologist , puts it : " The only people who will stop police brutality in the end are other cops .
