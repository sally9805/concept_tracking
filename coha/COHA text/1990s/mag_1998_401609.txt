Taking Virus Protection to an Illogical Extreme CAN I REMOVE a memory-resident virus-or any virus-by running DOS 's Fdisk and Format commands to wipe out everything on my hard drive ? Victor Heimur , Rutherford , New Jersey DO N'T DO IT ! Reformatting your hard drive takes a huge amount of work and likely wo n't kill the virus . After all , your boot floppy may also be infected-or your Fdisk or Format programs . Or you could reinfect your system while reinstalling your applications . And some viruses , like Monkey , can survive an Fdisk reformat and make things even worse . If your antivirus program ( you do have one , right ? ) ca n't fix the problem , contact the vendor . There may be a solution in the works , and if not , the experts in the lab will want to see what you 've got . You can also try another program ( see " Virus Killers 1998 , " March ) . ARE SWITCH BOXES SAFE ? I 'M INTERESTED in connecting my PC to two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope , an old Epson dot matrix . The first two need bidirectional connections . I thought of using a manual switch box , but I 've heard that these can send damaging voltage spikes to a printer . What should I do ? Andrew G. Detrick , Bellefontaine , Ohio SWITCH BOXES FALL into two categories , mechanical and electronic , depending on how they do the switching . You should never use a mechanical switch with laser or ink jet printers ; as you said , they can send nasty spikes through their cables . But electronic switch boxes are basically safe . A reasonably large number of companies manufacture both kinds . Many people think electronic switch boxes are automatic-that the boxes know when to switch devices . This is true if you 're sharing one printer with multiple computers , but not in a situation like yours , where you 're using multiple printers with one computer . So be sure you get an electronic switch box that also has a switch . Bidirectional connections are another issue . For this , you 'll want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printer will work even if the connection does n't support IEEE-1284 , but communication from the printer to the computer will be limited . ) IEEE-1284capable boxes are still rare , but by the time you read this , at least two companies , Cables to Go ( www.cablestogo.com ) and Belkin ( www.belkin.com ) , expect to release multiple IEEE-1284-capable boxes that can handle up to four devices . Depending on how many printers you want to hook up ( your options are generally two or four ) , whether you need IEEE1284 support , and assorted bells and whistles , the cost of an electronic switch box and the required cabling varies from about $50 to $110 . You can also use these switch boxes to handle parallel devices other than printers , such as scanners and external drives . While these devices often contain passthrough ports that allow you to connect more than one device to a port without a switch box , these pass-through ports are not without their own problems . NEW FORMATS IN THE NEW MENU WINDOWS ' NEW MENU , which I get when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Explorer , allows me to create new , empty files in a number of different formats . But the formats it offers are n't the ones I want . How do I add and remove file formats from this list ? Teresa Wiseman , Hudson , Illinois THE EASIEST WAY to edit the New menu is with Microsoft 's Tweak UI PowerToy . If you 're a Windows 95 user , you can download this useful free utility from Microsoft ( www.microsoft.com ) or from PC World Online ( www.fileworld.com ) . If you 're using Windows 98 , you already have Tweak UI . You 'll find it in the Windows 98 CD-ROM 's toolsreskit powertoy folder . Once you 've installed Tweak UI , select Start.Settings.Control Panel , double-click the Tweak UI icon , and click the New tab ( in the Windows 98 version , you 'll have to scroll to the tab ) . Here you 'll find a list of all the file formats Windows thinksbelong on the New menu . To remove a format , simply uncheck it . To add a file type to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file of the desired type . Use the application associated with the file type to do this , and save the file to an out-of-the-way folder . With that folder open , drag the file to the list of file types on Tweak UI 's New tab ( see FIGURE 1 ) . BACKING UP ADDRESSES I SOMETIMES HAVE TO reformat my hard drive to get Windows working properly . But when I do this , I lose all the names and fax numbers I 've entered into Microsoft Exchange , plus all the e-mail addresses I 've stored in Internet Explorer 's e-mail program . Can you please tell me what files to back up ? Kent A. Ravaioli , North Plainfield , New Jersey MICROSOFT HAS a habit of hiding data ( see " A Portable Outlook , " page 283 ) . Depending on the version of these programs you 're using , the versions you 've used in the past , whether you share your computer , and , quite possibly , how often you brush your teeth , your address book files can end up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One constant : They do n't end up in C : My Documents , where they logically belong . Another constant , thankfully , is the extension . Both Microsoft Exchange and Windows Messaging address books , which can contain e-mail addresses and fax numbers , are always . pab files . In Internet Mail and Outlook Express , however , they are . wab files . ( Microsoft Exchange and Windows Messaging are different versions of the e-mail/fax program that comes with Windows 95 ; Internet Mail and Outlook Express are different versions of the e-mail program that comes with Internet Explorer and Windows 98 . ) Before you format your drive , find your . pab or . wab file : Select Start-Find . Files or Folders , in the Named field , enter either *. pab or *. wab , depending on the program you 're using , and hit &lt;Enter&gt; . If the search yields only one file , that 's the one to back up . If there are multiple files , the right one is likely the one with your name ( kent.wab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure , enter the mail program , add a name to the address book , exit the program , and go back to the Find program and click Find Now . The right file will be the one with the most recent time . Restoring the file on your new PC is trickier , because the new installation may look for a file with a different name and path . For instance , on the old setup , the file may be in C : WindowsApplication DataMicrosoftAddress BookUserMPS.wab ; and on the new one in C : Windows ProfilesKentApplication Data MicrosoftAddress Bookkent.wab . As described above , search for the name and location of the file in the new setup . Once you 've found the file , note its name , and then rename it something like holdit.wab . Next , copy the old file to the same folder as the new one . If necessary , change its name to whatever the new file was before you renamed it . MUST SWAP FILES BE SO BIG ? I AM BAFFLED that PC World still recommends using a swap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I upgrade to 96MB of memory ( as I am about to do ) , do I need a 288MB swap file ? Bernard Kingsley , Worcester , Massachusetts MAYBE IT 'S TIME to reevaluate our recommendation . Today 's PCs have a lot more memory than they did even a year ago . On the other hand , programs hog more memory , and hard drives are bigger , so 288MB is n't the sacrifice it used to be . If you 're reluctant to give up that much hard drive space , try this test to determine whether you need to : Right-click My Computer and select Properties . Click the Performance tab , then the Virtual Memory button . Click the Let me specify my own virtual memory settings button ( see FIGURE 2 ) . Set the Minimum to 96 , and the Maximum to the highest number allowed-this is your available hard drive space , so do n't try to exceed it . When you 're done , click OK , Yes , Close , and Yes to reboot your PC . This way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to . But when it does need to , it will slow down . After a few days of regular use , go back and set the minimum higher . If there 's a significant performance improvement , stick with this new number . A PORTABLE OUTLOOK WHEN I USED Schedule Plus , I kept my addresses and contacts on a floppy disk so I could use them at home , work , and school . I now use Microsoft Outlook . Is there a way to keep the same info on a floppy so I can use it at any location ? Jerome P. Trojcak , Salina , Kansas ONCE AGAIN , we have to deal with the problem of Microsoft hiding data . The file you want is probably c : windows outlook.pst , but it could also be c : exchangemailbox.pst . The file is certainly something.pst . Just choose Start Find Files or Folders to find the file , then copy it to a floppy by right-clicking it and selecting Send To.3 ' ' , Floppy ( A ) . // FIGURE 1 : // FIGURE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer , make sure that Outlook is n't running . Then find that system 's . pst file , and copy the . pst file from the floppy disk over it , changing the name if necessary . Of course , once you know where the files are on all three of your PCs , you wo n't have to go looking for them again . Better yet , you can automate the process of copying the . pst file and uploading it to another PC by replacing the shortcut you use to launch Outlook with a batch file like the one in FIGURE 3 . You can create this batch file in Notepad or any other text editor . Be sure to change the paths and file names as appropriate for your particular system . The file name on A : should be the same on all of your computers . Make sure there is nothing , not even a line return , after cls . To save the batch file , select File.Save As , then select All Files ( *. * ) from the Best of Both Worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pane without giving up the real estate ? If you 're using Mijenix 's PowerDesk Utilities 98 , you can keep the folder tree turned off as a rule . Then , when you want to navigate to a folder , click the arrow next to the current folder 's name in the drivebar , and voila . " Save as type " drop-down list , and name the file outlook.bat. // FIGURE 3 : // One last note : Outlook data files can become too big for a floppy disk . But luckily , they compress nicely with any zipcompatible compression utility . The only problem is that you wo n't be able to use outlook.bat to automate the copying unless you add some lines for running PKZip or any other command-line compression utility ( and be sure to have that utility on each of your target systems ) .

Dwayne Neri of Littleton , Colorado , came up with a solution that 's faster than right-clicking the taskbar and selecting Minimize All Windows : Select Start-Run , type a period , and press &lt;Enter&gt; . Your desktop will appear in a separate window . If the current window is a file folder or Windows Explorer , click on another window first .
