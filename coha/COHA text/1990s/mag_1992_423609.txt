Section : Business Reviving America Clinton is struggling to find investment dollars <p> Dear President-elect Clinton : <p> We know you 're getting a lot of mail these days . Almost 30,000 letters a day , one of your aides told us . But do n't worry , this one does n't contain another resume from an eager job seeker . Just a few thoughts on the arithmetic of prosperity . <p> We 've been reading your economic blueprint , Putting People First , ' and your emphasis on long-term investment in training workers and rebuilding infrastructure caught our attention . After all , federal spending on public works has fallen by almost 50 percent as a share of Washington 's outlays since 1980 , and the United States spends one half to two thirds less than its chief competitors on training and jobs programs . Letitia Chambers , your transition budget adviser , recently told us , We 're looking at ways to reprioritize government spending to some degree , from consumption toward investment . ' <p> The problem with Putting People First ' is that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know by now . In fiscal 1994 , when you can write your first budget from scratch , you want to spend $64.4 billion on everything from economic development and tax fairness to education and training . You propose paying for this by raising taxes on the rich , by collecting more revenue from foreign companies and by cutting spending , mostly in defense and administration . But the sharp-pencil types who 've scrutinized your plan are scratching their heads . DRI/McGraw Hill says your budget gap for 1994 will be $13.5 billion . <p> Now , maybe this is your idea of fiscal stimulus , an option your advisers have n't ruled out . But realistically , $13.5 billion is a paltry addition to a $6 trillion economy . Moreover , the budget hawks on Capitol Hill and Wall Street will start circling the White House if you continue to promise long-term deficit reduction while proposing a budget that increases federal borrowing from Day One . <p> So in an effort to help you fund your investment program without further widening the $330 billion federal deficit , we pored over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion in additional annual savings . Believe it or not , we did it without touching Social Security , Medicare or defense procurement , where the really big money is spent . But we know you 've promised to halve the deficit by 1996 , and your budget scalpel will have to cut so-called entitlements and Pentagon outlays to achieve this . <p> In the meantime , we 're not saying the potential cuts here are painless . These programs , like most , have constituents who think they 're worthy and lobbyists to defend them . But you 've often said you would n't flinch from streamlining government . Moving $13.5 billion from government consumption to investment will create as many jobs as it destroys in the short run ; in the long run , it will improve productivity . Here , then , is a menu of cuts culled from studies by the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , the House Budget Committee , the General Accounting Office and various private groups to get you from a consumption budget to an investment program . Corporate subsidies Aiding business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to break into world export markets , there 's a place to call for help . Tucked away in the Commerce Department 's headquarters in Washington , the International Trade Administration furnishes free market research , export counseling and tips on finance . It even has an 800 number . Such services have plenty of merit at a time when U.S. companies are fighting for their lives in global markets . The problem is that these promotional activities will cost taxpayers $170 million next year . Worse , they subsidize foreign consumers because Americans pick up part of the sales and distribution costs that would otherwise be embodied in the price of U.S. exports . If the services have value , says CBO , business should pay for them . <p> Commerce 's trade-promotion office is just one of many ways that the government subsidizes U.S. business . The World Resources Institute estimates that the government subsidizes private water use through more than $1 billion a year in low-cost irrigation programs and lumber companies through $400 million a year in low-cost timber . U.S. News calculates that the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or charging business for them . Federal payroll Squeezing Washington 's workers $4.0 bil <p> No president wants to alienate the 3 million civil servants who staff the government . But then , civilian employees represent a whopping $125 billion per year in pay and fringe benefits . One way to carve out some savings would be to bring federal pensions more closely in line with private-sector pensions . For example , when the typical corporation calculates an employee 's pension , it averages the five most highly paid years of work , then pays a percentage of the average salary . But when the federal government calculates pensions , it uses the three most highly paid years , a technique that naturally results in higher average salaries . CBO estimates that diluting that average by adding one year to the calculation would save the government $50 million in 1994 alone . Bringing the government 's contribution to retirement savings plans more in line with private-sector practices would save an additional $350 million . <p> In fact , CBO identifies five ways to apply private-sector standards to federal benefits practices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in 1994 , while new guidelines on hospital usage by military dependents could save $450 million . Altogether , U.S. News estimates that aligning federal fringe benefits with private-sector benefits could save taxpayers $4 billion in 1994 . Farm aid Making farmers go to market $2.5 bil <p> America 's farmers are among the most efficient in the entire world . America 's farm policy , unfortunately , does not meet the same standard . The federal government will spend almost $1.6 billion in 1994 to compensate farmers if market prices for certain crops drop below government targets ; $620 million for a subsidized crop-insurance program that covers fewer than half of the eligible acres ; and another $180 million to farmers who already bring in more than $500,000 annually in commodity sales . <p> A few simple measures such as means-testing farm payments , replacing crop insurance with direct disaster assistance to farmers who actually suffer catastrophes and gradually moving toward market prices for key crops would save American taxpayers $2.5 billion in 1994 , according to U.S. News . These steps could also contribute to lower grocery bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government commitments $1.8 bil <p> Every year , the Department of Education writes checks for $750 million to some 2,700 school districts that are home to large numbers of federal workers . The rationale is that these districts have to educate children of federal employees , but federal installations do n't pay property taxes that finance most school districts . About half of this impact aid ' goes to the poorest school districts , but nearly one fifth goes to the richest ones . Cutting off aid to richer districts would save $140 million in 1994 . <p> Impact aid is one in a grab bag of grants and subsidies that could be reduced or eliminated . The Davis-Bacon Act , for example , which requires federal contractors to pay prevailing local wages on construction projects , could be changed to allow use of lower-wage workers for a saving of $570 million in 1994 . U.S. News believes that the government could save a total of $1.8 billion in 1992 by cutting back these miscellaneous expenses . <p> <p> <p> Governor Clinton , you will face tough choices in the Oval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the payoff could be great . The WEFA Group estimates that $13.5 billion spent on government investment today would produce $175.5 billion of national income by the year 2002 , as opposed to $162 billion of national income if the money were spent on consumption . You said that America wants prompt and aggressive action ' on the economy . The country is waiting on you .
