Discharge planning is a complex professional task that affects hospital fiscal health and the quality of posthospital care . A study of discharge planning found that social workers encounter many complications in working with patients , families , other professionals , and service providers in arranging posthospital care . The study found that several complications are associated with delays in discharge and less adequate discharge plans , assessed by social workers at the time the patient is leaving acute care and by the patient 1 month posthospitalization . Results suggest the importance of various skills for social workers in acute medical care . <p> Although discharge planning historically has been part of hospital social work ( Kerson , 1985 ) , few studies have addressed the problems that arise in arranging posthospital care plans or the impact of these problems on the efficiency and effectiveness of discharge planning . Identifying these complications would facilitate understanding of the tasks confronting discharge planners , as well as identify the professional skills required to enable the safe and timely transition of patients to lower levels of medical care . DISCHARGE PLANNING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discharge planning as a professional intervention . The American Hospital Association ( 1984 ) defines discharge planning as an interdisciplinary hospitalwide process that should be available to help patients and their families develop a feasible posthospital plan of care . Practitioners understand that discharge planning is a complex professional task that requires determining patient needs and wishes , assessing family resources and preferences , and facilitating communication between patients and family members ( Abramson , 198 &; Shulman and Tuzman , 1982 ) . Decisions , plans , and paperwork among hospital professionals also must be coordinated . And when patients or families require assistance in obtaining posthospital care , discharge planners work with community agencies and institutions , along with third-party reimbursement sources . <p> The context in which these tasks must be accomplished adds to their complexity . First , in the interdisciplinary hospital setting , social workers might be responsible for facilitating discharge planning , but medical staff generally are responsible for determining patient readiness for discharge and posthospital medical needs . Second , because discharge planning is usually initiated early in the patient 's hospital stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient 's medical prognosis remains uncertain . Finally , time constraints present further challenges . Even prior to prospective payment systems ( PPS ) , hospital stays shortened and patients were discharged sooner than anticipated . With PPS , however , the relationship between timely discharge and the fiscal health of hospitals solidified . As a result , the efficiency of discharge planning , often measured by length of stay , is scrutinized increasingly by hospital administrators . <p> Practitioners report that discharge planning rarely occurs smoothly ; obstacles are encountered in the myriad of decisions and plans that must be arranged between patients , families , medical staff , community services , and reimbursement sources . Although several articles have addressed screening criteria and timely referral , few studies have focused on the nature of obstacles faced by discharge planners . In one study of older patients discharged to nursing homes , Schrager , Halman , Myers , Nichols , and Rosenblum ( 1978 ) found that noncompletion of transfer forms by medical staff , unavailability of beds , and change in patient medical condition most frequently impeded discharge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay , Barker , Williams , Zimmer , Van Buren , Vincent , and Pickrel ( 1985 ) found that four types of system obstacles prevented timely discharge : ( I ) patient care issues ( including medical complications , psychosocial problems , and lack of communication among professionals or between family and staff ) , ( 2 ) structural or administrative issues ( limitations in Medicare coverage , availability of hospital services and equipment needed by patients ) , ( 3 ) deficiencies in coordination between hospital and community personnel , and ( 4 ) financial and legal issues ( including judicial system delays , Medicaid eligibility assessment delays , and unwillingness of agencies to accept Medicaid patients ) . Neither study analyzed the relationship of complications to patient factors nor explored the consequences of complications for the quality of discharge plans . <p> The authors conducted a study to investigate the complications social workers encounter in arranging posthospital care for medicare patients and to identify the problems requiring professional problem solving . In organization literature , nonroutine , exceptional , complex , and problem-filled situations signal the need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1983 ; Mintzberg , 1979 ; Perrow , 1967 ; Thompson , 1967 ) . Thus , results of this study might indicate whether discharge planning is routine or problem filled , suggesting the extent to which professional skills are required . <p> The study addressed three questions : ( 1 ) What are the complications encountered in discharge planning , and how frequently do they occur ? ( 2 ) What are the effects of the complications on the efficiency ( delay in discharge ) and effectiveness of discharge planning ( adequacy of the plan to meet patients ' posthospital needs ) ? and ( 3 ) What patient factors are associated with the various complications ? METHOD Subjects <p> The subjects were 286 older patients with Medicare coverage hospitalized at a large urban hospital with one of the following diagnoses : cerebral vascular accident ( n = 94 ) , congestive heart failure ( n = 96 ) , or hip fracture ( n = 96 ) . All patients discharged within the 1-year study period who met diagnostic and Medicare criteria were included until the targeted sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients ' cases through routine hospital procedure and were responsible for discharge planning . Seventy-five percent had master of social work ( MSW ) degrees and 25 percent had bachelor 's degrees . They had an average of 8.5 years of experience in hospital social work , and were employed at the hospital studied for an average of 6 years . Procedures <p> Within 24 hours of patients ' anticipated hospital discharge , researchers requested patients ' consent to participate in the study . Consent was provided by 99 percent of patients approached . The data used in this study derive from an interview with the patient 's social worker and from an interview with the patient month postdischarge . The social worker interview , which lasted about 30 minutes , was completed within 48 hours of the patient 's discharge to enhance worker ability to recall details of the discharge planning process . For the postdischarge patient interview , researchers conducted a telephone questionnaire with patients at their homes , nursing homes , or rehabilitation centers . Family or institutional staff were interviewed when patients could not participate . Follow-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Variables <p> Complications in Discharge Planning . Complications were defined as impediments to planning for patient posthospital care . Researchers , following a standardized format , asked the workers to indicate which complications , from a list of 15 , they encountered in planning the patient 's discharge . The list was pretested in four other hospitals and revised prior to the initiation of this study . Responses were coded as either yes or no , and " other " complications were recorded with open-ended descriptions . However , few responses were coded as " other . " The complications and their operational definitions were as follows : Financial impediments : Workers rated the extent to which finances complicated discharge planning with the patient . Patient confusion or dementia : Patient confusion ( acute or chronic ) made planning or decision making difficult ; planning was not complicated for all confused patients . Lack of family availability : Family members could not be reached , or could not meet with hospital staff because of schedule conflicts or logistic problems . Difficulties in working with the patient : Patients would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions or requests , or did not consider options for posthospital care . Difficulties in working with family : Family members were indecisive , unwilling to engage in planning , or did not follow social worker requests . Unexpected medical developments : A new medical condition required delaying or changing discharge plans . Medicare or Medicaid guidelines : Coverage restrictions or lack of clarity about covered services were obstacles . Lack of communication among team members : Hospital professionals misunderstood or did not share relevant information . Family disagreement : Family conflict hindered planning . Transportation problems : Problems arose in transporting the patient from hospital . Team disagreement regarding patient psychosocial situation : Medical staff and social worker disagreed about patient 's social , emotional , or economic needs . Forms not completed in timely fashion : Delay arose in completing hospital , third-party , or discharge destination forms . Delay in targeting discharge date : Discharge date was not targeted clearly ; social worker was unsure about anticipated discharge . Professional workers unavailable : Other hospital or community professionals were not available for consultation or arranging discharge . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded in an open-ended response . <p> The number of complications per case was measured by totaling the occurrence of each complication . The number of complications ranged from 0 to 14 . <p> Effectiveness of Discharge Plans . Two factors were considered in evaluating the discharge plan 's effectiveness . First , the " adequacy of plans , professional perspective at discharge " was rated by the social worker on a 5-point Likert-type scale , based on the adequacy of posthospital care to meet the patient 's medical needs . Values ranged from 1 ( plans were very inadequate ) to 5 ( plans would meet patient medical needs extremely well ) . The scale has strong face validity , and its significant variation by patient diagnosis and discharge destination along with its high association with patient and family satisfaction with discharge plans prove its concurrent validity ( Proctor &:; Morrow-Howell , 1988a , 1988b ) . A second effectiveness measure , " adequacy of plan , patient perspective I month postdischarge , " measured the adequacy of patients ' discharge plans in meeting their medical needs . The information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Values on the Likert-type scale ranged from 1 ( plans were very inadequate to meet their needs ) to 5 ( their needs were met extremely well ) . <p> Efficiency in Discharge Planning . Two measures of efficiency were obtained from the social work report . " Delay in discharge " ( yes/no ) was measured from the social worker 's judgment that discharge was delayed at least 1 day beyond the patient 's medical readiness . For delayed patients , " length of delay " ( a continuous variable ) was determined from the social worker 's indication of the number of days that elapsed between the points of medical readiness and actual discharge . <p> The social worker interview and hospital records measured other variables . These included patient age , gender , and Medicaid status . Social workers rated the patient 's mental condition at discharge in three categories : ( 1 ) mentally alert , ( 2 ) mildly disoriented , and ( 3 ) severely disoriented . The patient 's discharge destination was coded as home , nursing home ( intermediate care or skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The patient 's functional dependency was rated using Coe , Wilkerson , and Patterson 's ( 1986 ) Dependency at Discharge measure , which coded dependency from hospital nursing notes . RESULTS Description of Sample <p> The mean age of patients was 78.44 ; 24 percent of patients were married , and 80 percent were female . Two-thirds of the patients were white ; one-third were black or other minority . Patients ' discharge destinations were home , 52.9 percent ; nursing home , 32.0 percent ; and rehabilitation unit , 15.1 percent . All patients were eligible for Medicare reimbursement ; 16.4 percent were Medicaid eligible . At discharge , 61.5 percent of patients were mentally alert , 30.4 percent were mildly disoriented , and 8 percent were severely disoriented . The ratings of patient functional dependency at discharge were 5.7 percent in Class I ( most functional ) , 29.8 percent in Class II , 31.9 percent in Class III , and 32.6 percent in Class IV ( least functional ) . Type and Frequency of Complications <p> Social workers noted at least one complication in 61 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no complications . In 36.9 percent of the cases , two or more complications were reported . <p> The complications in their order of frequency of occurrence were reported ( Table 1 ) . Financial impediments were most frequent , occurring in more than one-fifth of the cases . When a financial complication was indicated , the worker specified the nature of the problem . Most frequently , the patient lacked private resources and Medicare/Medicaid would not cover needed services . The second most frequent type of financial complication occurred when a Medicaid application was made but remained pending . <p> Patient confusion , occurring in 18 percent of cases , was the second most frequent complication . Not all cases of patient confusion resulted in complicating the discharge planning ; 38.4 percent of the patients were rated as confused at discharge . In many cases the social worker could work with a spouse or other family member . <p> The next three most frequent complications related to work issues with patients and their families . These were lack of family availability , difficulties in working with patients , and difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct , they sometimes did occur together . For example , some families were unavailable when they also were unwilling to cooperate with the social worker . Consequences of Complications on Efficiency and Effectiveness <p> The consequences of complications were tested univariately . Although multivariate analyses are possible , univariate analyses are viewed as more appropriate given the finding that most often only one complication occurs per patient , and rarely did more than 3 complications occur together ; thus , understanding the impact of complications individually is important . Moreover , the complications do not occur together systematically . Correlation coefficients between the complications are low ; most are under .10 , with the highest being a r of .36 , indicating a shared variance of only 13 percent . Finally , because the consequences of specific complications were studied , univariate analysis was viewed as appropriate . Factors associated with adequacy of discharge plans are reported elsewhere ( Morrow-Howell , Proctor , &; Mui , in press ) . The univariate relationships between specific complications and each of four measures of efficiency and effectiveness are noted ( Table 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following complications to be related significantly to a delay in discharge : financial impediments , patient confusion , lack of family availability , difficulty in working with families , Medicare and Medicaid guidelines , unexpected medical developments , lack of communication among team members , family disagreement , and team disagreement regarding the patient 's psychosocial situation . <p> Length of Delay . When patients ' discharges were delayed , t-tests were conducted to compare the length of delay for cases in which complication occurred to the length of delay for cases in which complication did not occur . The length of delay was significantly longer when discharge planning was complicated by financial impediments , patient confusion , difficulties in working with families , transportation problems , and team disagreement regarding the patient 's psychosocial situation ( Table 2 ) . <p> Adequacy of Plan , Professional Perspective at Discharge . The t-tests showed that several complications were associated with less adequate discharge plans , as rated by the social worker at discharge : financial impediments , patient confusion , lack of family availability , difficulties working with families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychosocial situation ( Table 2 ) . <p> Adequacy of Plan , Patient Perspective 1 Month Postdischarge . T-test results show that three complications are associated with less adequate discharge plans from the patients ' perspectives 1 month postdischarge : financial impediments , patient confusion , and difficulties in working with patients ( Table 2 ) . <p> Correlations between Number of Complications Per Case and Measures of Efficiency and Effectiveness . Zero-order correlation coefficients showed significant relationships between number of complications and delay in discharge ( r = .35 , p = .0001 ) and number of complications and length of delay ( r = .49 , p = .0001 ) . Also , as the number of complications increased , the medical adequacy of the discharge plan decreased , both at discharge ( r = - .25 , p = .0001 ) and 1 month postdischarge ( r = - .18 , p = .01 ) . Factors Associated with Complications <p> To determine which patient factors are associated with various complications , the complications were treated as dependent variables in relation to several patient factors : age , sex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient mental condition at discharge , number of family members involved in discharge planning , diagnosis , and discharge destination . Multivariate analyses are appropriate here , because the aim is to explain as much variance as possible in the likelihood of each complication occurring . Moreover , each of the factors that serve as independent variables occur for each patient . Because the dependent variable was dichotomous ( the complication occurred or it did not ) and the overall occurrence of complications was relatively low , logistic analysis , based on a maximum-likelihood analysis of generalized logits ( SAS ) , was used ( Morrow-Howell &; Proctor , 1989 ) . Only complications experienced by at least 7 percent of the cases were tested , and only the variables significant at the bivariate level were tested at the multivariate level . The chi-square values from the multivariate logistic analyses , along with a pseudo R , indicating the goodness of the model , were reported ( Table 3 ) . The results show that for all the complications , only a small amount of variance is explained by the independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance in predicting financial impediments : race , diagnosis , and destination . Financial complications were significantly more likely in discharge planning with hip fracture patients , with black patients , and with patients discharged to skilled nursing facilities . <p> Two variables were associated with difficulties in working with patients : age and diagnosis . Younger patients and hip fracture patients were more likely to present difficulties . Difficulties in working with families were more likely to occur in discharge planning for female patients ( marginally significant ) and for confused patients . <p> Complications involving Medicare/Medicaid guidelines were most likely when patients were placed in skilled nursing care . Similarly , only destination , and specifically nursing home placement , was significantly associated with complications arising from lack of family availability . <p> Complications arising from patient confusion were more likely when nursing home placements were sought and when a greater number of family members were involved in the discharge planning . ( The variable mental status was eliminated from this regression because all cases in which this complication existed involved a patient who was confused . ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused patients require nursing home care and require family involvement in planning . <p> Only patient mental status was associated with unexpected medical development , and this relationship is only marginally significant . Again , the direction of this relationship is not clear , as more confused patients could be sicker and thus more likely to develop another medical problem ; alternatively , the unexpected medical situation could contribute to the confusion . DISCUSSION <p> One potential weakness of the study pertains to measurement . Three of the study 's four dependent variables were assessed on the basis of social worker perception . To enhance patient recall , social workers conducted interviews immediately after patient discharge and workers drew upon case notes . In spite of these precautions , patient responses may be biased by social desirability . <p> Another study weakness might derive from the list of complications measured . Because researchers and respondents were social workers , a social work perspective is likely reflected in the complications tested and reported . Other hospital professionals might have reported different complications . <p> A strength of the study is its assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adequacy of posthospital care plans . Methodological strengths are the study 's prospective design and its evaluation of adequacy from two perspectives  --  professional and patient  --  and at two points in time . The study conceptualization and design might contribute to further investigation of discharge planning and social worker roles in enhancing the quality of patients ' posthospital care . <p> Findings indicate that discharge planning is complex , usually plagued by one or more complications that are not amenable to quick fixes . The most frequent complication , financial , reflects situations in which resources are inadequate , often due to restrictions in the Medicare and Medicaid systems . Thus , social workers often face the difficult task of developing care plans that require financial resources that are unavailable . Many of the frequent complications involve working with families around difficult decisions that must be reached within strict time limits . Other complications arise from the interdisciplinary and often interorganization teamwork necessary to coordinate the patient movement from acute to lower levels of health care . <p> Most of the complications threaten the timeliness of discharge . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discharge delay increases and care plan adequacy is reduced . <p> Several complications were associated with less adequate posthospital care plans . When workers reported a planning complication due to patient confusion , they rated the discharge plans as less adequate . This may reflect worker concern about the quality of care available to the confused elderly patient , or their worry over lack of opportunity to include the patient in planning . Social workers also rated discharge plans as less adequate when families were difficult to engage or work with . <p> The negative relationship between some complications and care plan adequacy persists 1 month after discharge . Findings suggest long-term negative consequences of financial complications and patient confusion . Patients with whom discharge planners had difficulty working also had less adequate care plans at follow-up , suggesting that lack of patient involvement has persistent negative consequences . <p> Logistic regression models explained only a small amount of variance in the occurrence of complications , suggesting the difficulty of predicting the complications social workers face on any particular case . Although such unpredictability might be due to study weaknesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Work with patients and families in acute medical care settings is not routine , and many complications can not be known in advance . The findings suggest the importance of professional assessment and intervention in discharge planning . <p> However , the variables in this data set identified some patient groups at greater risk for certain complications . The results suggest that different patient variables are associated with different complications . Study findings were shared with social workers who participated in the study ; their observations helped interpret these findings . <p> Younger patients may be more difficult to work with because they have adjusted less to illness , do not have caregiving networks in place , and are more reluctant to expend private financial resources on medical care , fearing such resources will be needed over the years for living expenses . <p> Family composition and patterns of decision making may explain the greater number of complications in working with families of female patients . For married female patients , the discharge planner is likely to work with husbands ; engaging them in planning may be difficult because many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or providing care . Older female patients are often widowed , due to gender differences in life expectancy and age at marriage , making it necessary for discharge planners to work with adult children who may be suddenly thrust into decision-making and caregiving roles . Children may be more reluctant to make decisions about nursing home placements for their mothers than their fathers , due to greater emotional and caregiving involvement between mothers and their adult children ( Brubaker , 1985 ) . <p> Race may be associated with the complication of financial problems because of its association with financial status . Methodological limitations prevented the direct assessment of socioeconomic status , which would be preferable . <p> Complications are more likely when a patient is confused and more family members are involved in discharge planning . Such patients require higher levels of care , and their families may have difficulty making decisions without patient input . Moreover , consensus about care plans may be difficult to reach with more family members involved . <p> Social workers found hip fracture patients more difficult to work with , perhaps due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden disability . Also , Medicare restrictions for rehabilitation made financial complications more likely with hip fractures . Only weight-bearing patients are viewed as good candidates for rehabilitation and thus , eligible for Medicare reimbursement . <p> Patients discharged to nursing homes , particularly skilled nursing facilities , also present complications related to financial and Medicaid/ Medicare guidelines . In the Midwest state where the study was conducted , Medicaid reimbursements for skilled and intermediate care are nearly equivalent , although skilled care is much more expensive to provide . As a result , locating skilled beds for Medicaid patients is difficult . <p> Social workers also experienced more complications in working with patients ' families when patients were discharged to nursing homes , rather than home or rehabilitation . This may reflect the difficulty of decision making about nursing home placements , the necessity of family participation in screening and selecting nursing homes ( York and Calsyn , 1977 ) , and family reluctance to be involved for fear of financial obligations . <p> In today 's cost-conscious health care environment , those responsible for discharge planning are sometimes held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments have regarded such responsibility as misplaced . However , without systematic documentation and analysis of the source of complications , departments can neither problem-solve in areas where they might have impact or advocate in their own behalf within the hospital environment . This study , by clarifying the nature and source of complications , may intervene to reduce the frequency and impact of the complications encountered in discharge planning . <p> Although it is clear that some complications specific to working with acutely ill elderly patients , such as unexpected medical developments and patient confusion , can not be eliminated , the effects of these complications can be minimized through early intervention ( Boone , Coulton , &; Keller , 1981 ; Rehr , Berkman , &; Rosenberg , 1980 ; Cunningham , 1982 ) and through planning as far ahead as possible ( Rosen , Proctor , &; Livne , 1985 ) . However , other complications can be resolved , although the various complications require different professional actions . <p> Complications arising from inadequate financial resources and from Medicare and Medicaid restrictions require action at the state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to deal with financial problems only through early intervention and planning , but hospital social work departments can document the impact of financial impediments and provide data to professional and consumer groups who work for policy level change . <p> Some complications , like team communication , paper flow , and the availability of professionals , require interdepartmental remediation within the hospital . When social work departments document the frequency of such complications , locate their source , and take initiative in hospitalwide problem solving , they become a constructive force in addressing hospitalwide issues of fiscal health and quality of patient care ( Morrow-Howell &; Proctor , 1988 ) . <p> Seven of the 14 complications documented in this study pertain to family , patient , and resource issues . This reveals the necessity of professional skills in assessment , communication , resource brokering , advocacy , and family therapy  --  clearly the domain of social work . The findings of this study prove that discharge planning is more complex than mere " body moving " or arrangement of concrete services ( Grossman , Harrell , &; Melamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the increasing disenchantment of many hospital social workers with discharge planning and the simultaneous eagerness of nurses to incorporate discharge planning into their responsibilities . Indeed , the range of complications documented in this study highlights the variety of problems encountered and the range of professional skills required to plan adequately and efficiently for posthospital care . Social work professionals should assert the legitimacy of their claim to discharge planning and the level of professionalization required . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p>
