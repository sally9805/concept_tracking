<p> Baseball 's newest arrivals are about to come of age . <p> The Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Arizona Diamondbacks do n't begin play until next season , but their inaugural rosters will be shaped by the 35 players each selects in the Nov. 18 expansion draft . <p> By the time a coin flip determines who picks first in the three-round draft , the new teams will have scouted every eligible player at every level among the 28 existing teams from which they 'll draft . <p> Fourteen teams will lose two players each and 14 ( seven in the National League and seven in the American League ) will lose three players each . <p> The tricky part : Arizona and Tampa Bay wo n't know which players are available until 16 days after the completion of the World Series . That 's when the existing teams must submit their 15-player protected lists . <p> Because organizations will want to protect not only star veterans but top prospects , it 's essential that Tampa Bay and Arizona have done their homework . <p> " First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Devil Rays general manager Chuck LaMar . " We really ca n't get caught up on who might or might not be available . We 're looking at it from a pure scouting standpoint . Once we get the lists , we can narrow it down to who can help our club . " <p> Diamondbacks GM Joe Garagiola Jr . expects to find quality talent available in the draft , but is tempering his anticipation . <p> " You have to give the other organizations credit for knowing their own players , " he says . " We think they will protect their better players . Ultimately , players available will represent no better than the 16th best in each organization . " <p> Many factors will help the existing clubs determine who to protect , but some are out of their hands . Players with no-trade clauses , such as Philadelphia 's Gregg Jefferies , must be protected , as do the Phillies ' Lenny Dykstra and other 10-5 players ( a 10-year veteran who has been with the same team the last five years or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Diamondbacks , who gave top amateur Travis Lee a $ 10 million signing bonus , wo n't likely be interested in a first baseman . But the Devil Rays might be interested if , for example , Eric Karros and his four-year , $ 20 million contract extension is left unprotected by the Los Angeles Dodgers . <p> Also expect pre-arranged trades to play a significant part in the draft proceedings . Free-agent signings will help the new teams set their rosters . <p> The existing teams do n't have an enviable task , says New York Yankees GM Bob Watson . " You can only protect 15 , and that includes some young guys in the minor leagues we really like , " he says . " You know you 're going to get hurt , but you just hope it 's not too bad . " <p> Cincinnati Reds GM Jim Bowden expects to feel the bite more this time than when the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins were drafting in 1992 . <p> " We have more quality throughout than five years ago , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality players . " <p> Despite the detriment , the expansion draft is " a fair and equitable system , " Bowden says . " The clubs are being paid a lot of money for the players we 're losing . " <p> The Diamondbacks and Devil Rays , who paid $ 300 million in expansion fees , showed last year they would spare no expense to be competitive by committing $ 29 million to amateur draft picks . <p> Since being awarded franchises in 1995 , both clubs have had the benefit of two amateur drafts to help stock their farm systems and two years to prepare for the expansion draft . <p> " That 's a great advantage they 've had , " says Rockies GM Bob Gebhard . " We had to cram two drafts ( the amateur and expansion ) into our first year of operation . " <p> If you consider the progress of the Rockies and Marlins since their initial 1993 season , expansion does n't have to mean a long wait to become a contender . Colorado made the ' 95 playoffs as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marlins are the NL 's wild-card front-runners this season . <p> " Arizona and Tampa Bay have had time to do a thorough job of scouting , and they 'll do a fine job , but the other organizations have put in their homework , too , " says Marlins GM Dave Dombrowski . <p> " Every organization knows its talent and will try its best to keep it . When you 're drafting the 16th-best player from each team , there 's only so much you can do . " <p> Phoenix was chosen as site of the expansion draft because major league GMs are meeting in Scottsdale , Ariz. , a week earlier . It 's the first time the expansion draft will be conducted outside of New York . <p> A date for the coin flip has n't been determined .
