They are so young and so tiny that spectators want to pat them on the head . When their eyes narrow and their faces scrunch up with concentration , audiences go squishy with the adorableness of it all . Sports commentators cooingly label them pixies and tots , then reach for adjectives like huggable , perky , cute . Sort of like puppies . Always they are described as " the next " Olga or Nadia or Mary Lou , as if anyone so small could n't possibly have standing in her own right . <P> Let 's get real . The young female gymnasts who will vie for medals in Barcelona are among the world 's toughest athletes . They are not only strong , powerful and agile , but they also have a discipline , determination and dedication that would put many other athletes to shame . Two times daily , six days weekly , year after year , they labor in airless gymnasiums to master and reinvent the most difficult flips , twists and spins . Often they work in spite of painful strains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark knowledge that the slightest bobble or a judge 's caprice could mean the hundredth-of-a-point deduction that robs them of their glory . <P> This year the U.S. has produced two of the top picks for all-around gold honors in Barcelona  --  an unprecedented American pair at the top . Not surprisingly , both are known for their doggedness and tenacity . Kim Zmeskal of Houston , the reigning world all-around champion , battles persistent pain from a stress fracture in her left wrist and the psychological pressure of being the person everyone else wants to beat . Shannon Miller of Edmond , Okla. , who was sidelined in late March with a dislocated left elbow and bone chip , recuperated from surgery in record time , and is now stronger and more confident than ever . Spectators who favor a dynamic , explosive style will want to wager on Zmeskal . Those who appreciate technical brilliance and high-level difficulty , however , will prefer the graceful Miller . <P> But bettors beware . Hungary 's Henrietta Onodi has a fluid , elegant presentation that pleases audiences as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Unified Team are formidable . Several of the competitors  --  1988 gold medalist Svetlana Boginskaya and the two Tatianas , Gutsu and Lisenko  --  have a shot at the all-around title , and there may be some stealth talent in the wings . Nonetheless , in American gymnastic circles many think this is the year the U.S. women could upset the long dominant ex-Soviets for the team gold . " The Soviets are weaker financially and spiritually , and do n't know who they 're representing , " says Steve Nunno , Miller 's coach . " They do n't have the emotional fire . " <P> Zmeskal , 16 , and Miller , 15 , would find a kindred spirit in the other if their paths ever crossed long enough to find out  --  an unlikely prospect , given the tense rivalry between their respective coaches . Zmeskal is giggly and seems more inclined to listen than talk , but next to the admittedly shy Miller , whose tiny voice barely rises above a whisper , she is positively gregarious . Though both are 4-ft. 7-in. standouts , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being " sweet " and " friendly , " two words not used casually in the hypercompetitive world of gymnastics . Unlike the many gymnasts who must train far away from their families , Zmeskal and Miller work close to home , enabling both to enjoy the steadying influence of their parents and two siblings apiece .
