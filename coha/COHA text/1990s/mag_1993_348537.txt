TITLE : OLIVIER OLIVIER <P> DIRECTOR and WRITER : AGNIESZKA HOLLAND <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : A bleak film offers a discomfiting vision of family values . <P> Tragedy cures dysfunction . So made-for-TV movies teach us . Death and disease , addiction , abuse and abduction  --  shattering though these may be at first , all eventually cause fictional ( or , more likely , fictionalized ) families to draw closer together , to discover new strengths in the final reel 's final analysis . <P> Agnieszka Holland , the Polish woman who made Olivier Olivier in France , has obviously not seen a lot of American TV . So she is free to imagine the force of domestic disaster as centrifugal , not centripetal . The result is an awkward film that moves one not toward pity but toward dark reflection on the unbearable chaos that always shadows  --  as we tend to forget  --  ordinary being . <P> The Duval family of Provence is introduced as a disaster waiting to happen . The father ( Francois Cluzet ) , a country vet , is angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague and forgetful , unhealthily doting on her younger child Olivier . Olivier 's elder sister Nadine ( Marina Golovine ) thinks entirely too much about extraterrestrials . When Olivier , wearing his red cap , disappears while taking food to his grandmother 's house ( the fairy-tale parallel is obvious ) , grief becomes his family 's excuse to surrender to their separate pathologies . <P> What the Duvals require is a miracle , the restoration of Olivier , the sunny source of their little universe 's gravitational power , and after the passage of a few years , Holland provides them with that astonishment . He appears in the unlikely form of an adolescent Parisian street hustler ( Gregoire Colin ) . But the Duvals , even skeptical Nadine , are not inclined to question him closely . If he is a lie , he is the saving lie they all need , and in the end he does accidentally provide the definitive answer to the mystery that has riven them . <P> Holland does not cloak that riddle as well as she might , and her variation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as she showed in last year 's Europa , Europa , she also has a way of administering jolts from the blue that usefully subvert our narrative and moral expectations . The value of this bleak film , which says that the family , like any other institution , requires agreed-upon fictions to sustain itself , derives from that talent .
