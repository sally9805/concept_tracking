An ' do n't you never use information you illegally obtained ! NIKOS TOMADAKIS Are you crazy ? My mother lives here also . ORIAH PEABODY Sure , she does . Why 're you two fightin ' ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS We are not fighting . TROUT O'DONNELL It would n't interest me to fight with a prune-head . ( To NIKOS . ) But lemme tell you , you got no heart , an ' thet 's why you cai n't talk to yer mama . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Do n't speak of my mother again ! If I need advice , it would n't be from someone like you . ORIAH PEABODY What d' you mean , someone like Trout ? TROUT O'DONNELL Oh , I 'm gettin ' outta here ! ( As she storms out . ) See you later , Grandma . ORIAH PEABODY ( A long silence , while she studies NIKOS . ) Yer a very powerful man . NIKOS TOMADAKIS What ? ORIAH PEABODY I seldom seen my granddaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 30 NIKOS TOMADAKIS It had nothing to do with me . I was a scapegoat . THEA TOMADAKIS Where have the goats gone ? Has Charos taken them ? ORIAH PEABODY ( To NIKOS . ) I do n't think so . THEA TOMADAKIS But what little we know , when it comes down to the end . ORIAH PEABODY ( To THEA . ) Do n't know much in the beginning , neither . NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( To ORIAH . ) You were n't there ! I walked into her anger . She did n't really see me . ORIAH PEABODY My gran'chile do n't usually keep her mouth shet when she ought , but she knows what she sees . NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Dismissing ORIAH . ) Fine . Let her see whatever she wants about me . ( To THEA . ) Mama , I 'm going out for a walk . ( No response from THEA . ) I 'll return soon . ORIAH PEABODY Take yer time . I 'll set with her a spell . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Please . Do n't try to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two women are alone , staring front . ORIAH begins to hum a folk tune , then she starts to fidget . First her hands move , then her feet tap the footrest of the wheelchair . Then she moves the chair back and forth as though she is dancing . Appalachian fiddle music begins softly ) p. 31 THEA TOMADAKIS ( Staring straight ahead . Throughout the following dialogue she never looks at ORIAH . ) What is it ? That music ? ORIAH PEABODY Hey ! You hear it too ? THEA TOMADAKIS Like the lyre . But not so wild . ORIAH PEABODY That 's mountain fiddle . Cai n't hardly set still when it comes round . THEA TOMADAKIS The dancers ? Where are they ? ORIAH PEABODY Back in the mountains . Ai n't nobody here but me at this very moment . ( The Appalachian fiddle music gradually changes to Cretan lyre music . ) THEA TOMADAKIS But look ! There , outside the village . Oh , what a dancer Yannis is ! Leading the men , as always , twirling his handkerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ORIAH PEABODY Least he was a dancer . Took a lot to get Clyde to dance with me . Had to teach him down by the river , where Daddy would n't know . Never did think he 'd learn , us stumblin ' round on the slippery grass THEA TOMADAKIS The men never dance with the women . ORIAH PEABODY Oh , they sometimes do . Or try , at the least . p. 32 THEA TOMADAKIS Yannis is the best dancer in Sfakia . Of course , everyone admires his skill , but they are afraid of him , as you can imagine . So wild , my gypsy , so fearless ! That is what I see in his dancing ORIAH PEABODY There was this night in April when you could smell spring stealin ' round the mountain . Clyde took me down to the county fair . They had these fiddlers , and people were dancin ' right between the prize hawgs an ' the sweet potato pie . THEA TOMADAKIS Ah ! He leaps into the air and flings himself over the shoulder of young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ORIAH PEABODY Goats ? I ' member this four-hunnerd-fifty-pound hawg lifted her big ol ' head when Clyde gathered me up in his arms THEA TOMADAKIS He 's dancing for me , who never should be there . But how can I resist ? ORIAH PEABODY I could n't resist neither when we glided round an ' round , smooth , jes ' like them little brides an ' grooms a top a weddin ' cakes . THEA TOMADAKIS Now he springs onto the table , balances a glass on top of the wine bottle and He stands on the glass . No , he is dancing on the glass ! Oh , the lyre goes crazy , and I , with longing . p. 33 ORIAH PEABODY I know what you mean . We were n't married then . But I knew Clyde was thinkin ' ' bout it . An ' I knew Mama an ' Daddy would n't mind atall ' cause Clyde was gittin ' a job in the coal mines . THEA TOMADAKIS But there is nothing I can do . I 've lost something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Where are you ? ORIAH PEABODY Well , thet goes without sayin ' . THEA TOMADAKIS I 'm going to marry the wrong man . I feel it . Oh , he will be very nice , but He will not be Yannis . ORIAH PEABODY I never wanted no one but Clyde . Even after all them years in the mine , when his lungs got black as the coal itself , an ' he did n't hardly laugh no more . THEA TOMADAKIS So that later I will have to go through the flames . But that will be a useless sacrifice , because I am so careless and inattentive . TROUT O'DONNELL ( Voice , offstage . ) Come back ! It 's getting dark . ORIAH PEABODY Yep . I should of paid attention myself . I should of seen Clyde 's death stalkin ' round the mountain an ' got him outta there . THEA TOMADAKIS ( As lights dim on stage and come up behind back scrim of mountains and olive trees : Crete . THEA and ORIAH move off to the left and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so easy to fall and not know you 're falling . p. 34 TROUT O'DONNELL ( As THEA , 15 years old . Tumbles in , dressed in Cretan embroidered apron over a plain skirt , a scarf on her hair . She speaks with a slight Greek accent . Lyre music up . ) Oh ! Where am I ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( As CHAROS or DEATH , in boots , Cretan embroidered vest , headband . ) So . Look at this : a visitor . What are you doing here , little one ? TROUT O'DONNELL I 'm not sure . The sun was so hot I fell asleep , under an olive tree at the edge of our village . Then there was a cold wind from the sea NIKOS TOMADAKIS And when you woke up , your goats had disappeared . TROUT O'DONNELL I could n't find them , not anywhere . ( Beat . ) But how did you know ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS I know many things about the earth . TROUT O'DONNELL Oh . Then you know that I searched for my goats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked across the moon ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS Yes . And then you saw the fire . TROUT O'DONNELL In front of the cave down in the gorge . But I was still high up on the mountain . NIKOS TOMADAKIS And yet you thought you saw your small goat p. 35 TROUT O'DONNELL Entering the cave . Yes , but then it may have been a shadow , because it was so dark , and I was way above her . Still , I called " Koritsi ! " , because she is my little girl . I was leaning then far out from the rocks , so slippery with the wet night air NIKOS TOMADAKIS When you lost your balance . I heard you scream , and I saw you falling down the mountain . TROUT O'DONNELL I slid and tumbled over the rocks . I grabbed at the bushes , but they would n't hold me ; my fingers burned past them . Then I.do n't know . I thought there was a river . But there is no river . And a man with a boat ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOMADAKIS You are in my cave . TROUT O'DONNELL Your cave ! Then where is my little Koritsi ? Did she come in here ? She is so foolish , you know , always running away and getting into much trouble . NIKOS TOMADAKIS She is here . TROUT O'DONNELL Oh , let me see her ! I want her back . NIKOS TOMADAKIS No . She likes it here . She is mine now . TROUT O'DONNELL But why ? You have no need for her , I 'm sure . NIKOS TOMADAKIS You know nothing . p. 36 TROUT O'DONNELL That 's not true ! I 've been to school , and I know a great many things . I may be the smartest girl in our village , I ( Beat . ) Who are you ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS My name is Charos . TROUT O'DONNELL No !

I 'm too young , and I 'm going to be married in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand away from her beads . ) Do n't clutch those blue beads . What good will they do ? I 'm not the Evil One . TROUT O'DONNELL You are . I know all about you . NIKOS TOMADAKIS You 've read your books , neh ? TROUT O'DONNELL Malista . Yes . And I 've listened to my mother . And my grandmother , who is very wise . She knows everything when she reads the coffee grounds . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Ah ! Then you know that Death is not evil . He is.simply Death . TROUT O'DONNELL Do n't try to trick me ! You 're just what I knew you would be , except.younger . And.very handsome . You look like a gypsy I know . p. 37 NIKOS TOMADAKIS I am whatever you wish me to be . TROUT O'DONNELL What do I care what you are ? I am going to be a mother , with two children . A boy and a girl . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Kali tikhi . Good luck . TROUT O'DONNELL I wo n't stay here with you , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when I want you , I 'll come and get you . You can be sure of that . TROUT O'DONNELL Not unless I wish to come . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Foolish girl ! Someday you 'll be my bride . TROUT O'DONNELL Never . NIKOS TOMADAKIS I 'll come for you on my black horse ; you 'll scream as I sweep you up in my arms TROUT O'DONNELL I 'll do no such thing . NIKOS TOMADAKIS All the villagers will be watching . We 'll make a great thunder as we ride away in clouds of dust . TROUT O'DONNELL Do n't be silly . NIKOS TOMADAKIS In your white dress and crown , you 'll clutch me , terrified , and the earth will open for us . It will be very romantic . p. 38 TROUT O'DONNELL No , do n't tell me such things . I 'm not supposed to listen to strangers . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Nonsense . I 'm not a stranger . I know everything about you . The games you play , the stories you tell your friends TROUT O'DONNELL You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to travel far away and meet many people . You 'll write books . TROUT O'DONNELL I ? Write books ?

Why should you enjoy life when you can be sensible ? p. 39 TROUT O'DONNELL You 're confusing me . NIKOS TOMADAKIS I find it surprising that a lovely girl like you TROUT O'DONNELL You think I 'm lovely ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS Lovely as the sea spraying up from the rocks in morning sun . TROUT O'DONNELL Oh , I 'm not that lovely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in springtime . TROUT O'DONNELL I remember : you married her . You have a wife . NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Sadly . ) Just six months each year . The rest of the time I 'm alone . TROUT O'DONNELL ( Beat . ) Perhaps I 'll stay here with you for a while . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Ah , truly a child of Crete , in love with Death . TROUT O'DONNELL I am not in love with you ! And do n't make fun of me . I 've decided I like it here , that 's all . NIKOS TOMADAKIS I 'm delighted . ( Beat . ) What is your name ? TROUT O'DONNELL It is ( Beat . ) I do n't know .

NIKOS TOMADAKIS I must tell you no one has ever proposed to me so directly . p. 41 TROUT O'DONNELL That was not a proposal . It was . a strong suggestion . You said I would be your bride someday . But I 'm already here . NIKOS TOMADAKIS I 'm expensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no money , but.after all , my Koritsi is here ! If you take her , wo n't that be enough ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS No , my dear . I 've had too many easy victories . I 'll take you when you are so old your beauty makes even Charos catch his breath . TROUT O'DONNELL Old people are n't beautiful . NIKOS TOMADAKIS An unfortunate misconception . TROUT O'DONNELL I know it 's shameless , but I give myself to you . NIKOS TOMADAKIS I 'll tell you a secret : I like to wait . Wander a while . Burn in a fire . And find out who you are . When you 're buried in your white dress and crown , with your money in your mouth , I 'll lift you out of the boat and take you home .

THEA TOMADAKIS I do n't remember you there when my soul was between my teeth . NIKOS TOMADAKIS It was never between your teeth . THEA TOMADAKIS At least you bathed my body with warm wine and dressed me in my white wedding gown ? ( Laughs . ) Did you have to cut the seams a little ?

Her mind is gone . ORIAH PEABODY Why 's she puttin ' money in ' er mouth ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS It 's an old Greek custom . So the dead can pay the ferryman to take them across the river of Death . ORIAH PEABODY Did n't know there was a river of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NIKOS TOMADAKIS It 's also an ancient Greek legend . My mother knows them all . She.wrote a book about the legends of the dead .

Now that Papa 's gone , she 's letting herself die . Christina wrote to me when I was in Crete , but I was too selfish to believe it .

DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS Good evening , ladies . ORIAH PEABODY Evenin ' , Doc . DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS ( Apparently to both women , but really his attention is on TROUT . ) Wonderful singing ! ORIAH PEABODY Oh , I cai n't sing the way I use to . I withered up my voice yellin ' too much . p. 59 DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS You , Oriah ? I ca n't picture you yelling at anyone . ORIAH PEABODY Times I recall when I use to yell at the kids was roamin ' all over the mountain an ' I could n't find ' em . Then later I did a lotta yellin ' at them coal thugs . DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS ( His attention still straying to TROUT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Coal thugs ? ORIAH PEABODY Big tough guys from the coal company thet 'd come round lookin ' fer my husband when he was organizin ' . DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS ( Laughing , he pats ORIAH 's shoulder . ) Ah , yes . I hear you were quite a trouble maker . ORIAH PEABODY ( Offended . ) Not me . I were n't the one caused no trouble . Did I beat up folks an ' come round their houses with guns ? I was merely defendin ' my chil'ren . DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS I 'm sure you were . Well , obviously toughness runs in your family . ( TROUT begins humming . ) ORIAH PEABODY No use talkin ' ' bout thet now . Anyways , it 's Trout got the real voice . Why , did you know she was a singer in Nashville ? p. 60 DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS Yes , I did . Trout told me all about it . We 've been good friends for two years now , have n't we , Trout ? TROUT O'DONNELL ( Ignores him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' three lines DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS Oriah , there 's a play that might interest you . It 's starting in a few minutes down in the lounge .

TROUT O'DONNELL It do n't help nobody to deny what they think is real . See , I think if you go along with her DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS Trout and I are having a private talk . p. 62 TROUT O'DONNELL No , I do n't mind .

( Beat . ) Since when are you giving him advice ? TROUT O'DONNELL Oh , it ai n't nothin ' . He needs help with his mama . DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS Stay away from him . He 's got a bad disposition . TROUT O'DONNELL You jealous , Doc ? DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS Trout , I want to be friends . And more . You know that . But the point is , my marriage TROUT O'DONNELL Notice how you say " marriage " like it 's a damn institution ? DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS It is , for Christ 's sake ! It 's my position in the community , my home , my children , my friends And I know you do n't want to hear this , Trout , but it 's also my wife . TROUT O'DONNELL Gosh , Doc , how ' bout yer collie dog with the soulful eyes an ' yer cute little calico cat ? p. 63 DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS I 'm being serious , Trout . If you 'd been willing to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . You know thet . DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS I couldn't. ca n't divorce Jenna . Look , what if I pay your rent every month ? TROUT O'DONNELL Yer playin ' with me . DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS Okay . ( Opens his wallet . ) Rent plus spending money . Then you can work fewer hours and have more time for me . TROUT O'DONNELL ( Jumping up and swinging her banjo as though she would smash him with it . ) You low-down polecat ! I 'm gon na knock yer brains out ! DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS ( Pointing his finger at her . ) Freeze it ! Right now ! ( Surprised , TROUT freezes , her banjo still raised . ) DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS Now I 'm going to tell you something , and you 'd better hear it . Your grandmother is here by my grace only . This room , the price you pay , is all because of me . I 'm sorry to have to remind you this way , but I do n't want any more trouble around here . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother will have to leave . Do you hear me ? p. 64 TROUT O'DONNELL ( Still frozen , she stares at him with open hatred . ) Yep . DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS I have no other choice . ( As he turns to leave . ) Think about it . ( He exits . ) TROUT O'DONNELL ( Slowly lowers her banjo , staring out as though she is stunned . ) I been buryin ' my head in the ground . ( She sinks down into a chair and begins to cry , her eyes wide open and staring out at nothing . ) I 'm so dumb , I ai n't fit to live . NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Enters from THEA 's room , does n't notice TROUT . He crosses to TV , turns on a situation comedy , sits on the daybed , crosses his arms and stares grimly at the T.V. ) TROUT O'DONNELL ( Turning away from him , she curls up in the chair like a wounded animal . ) NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Lighting a cigarette . ) Such trash ! TROUT O'DONNELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ callin ' trash ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS What ? Oh , hello . I did n't see you . p. 65 TROUT O'DONNELL I said : who you callin ' trash ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS For God 's sake ! The television . I was talking about the television . TROUT O'DONNELL Turn it off ! NIKOS TOMADAKIS Why do you behave like this again so suddenly ? Do you think you own this place ? TROUT O'DONNELL ( Jumping up . ) No , I certainly do n't ! I do n't own nothin ' ! ( She strides to ORIAH 's room . ) I do n't have a goddamn thing ! ( She exits . ) NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Stares after her in astonishment . Then he turns to the TV , watches it blankly and smokes . Clearly he is trying to digest the information he has just received . ) Well . ( He gets up and absent-mindedly turns off the TV . ) So . ( Sits down again . Blows smoke rings and watches them . ) ORIAH PEABODY ( Wheeling herself in . She sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowadays . Jes ' ' bout as bad as the TV . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Good evening . ORIAH PEABODY Evenin ' . ( Beat . ) I may be ol ' , but I ai n't senile . p. 66 NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Worried that once again he 's unintentionally offending someone . ) I did n't say anything . ORIAH PEABODY Oh , it ai n't you . I 'm talkin ' ' bout thet dumb play Doc tole me to go down an ' see . ( In a conspiratorial whisper . ) I guess he jes ' wanted to talk private with Trout . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Yes . ORIAH PEABODY They had some kinda fallin ' out . Trout married the wrong man , y'know , back in Memphis when she were n't but seventeen , an ' she 's been real sensitive ever since . NIKOS TOMADAKIS She 's still married ? ORIAH PEABODY Hell , no ! But he was a mean one , ol ' Leary . ( She moves closer to NIKOS , so she can speak quietly . ) Took ' er to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she would n't sing the way he wanted . She had to run off in the night . NIKOS TOMADAKIS How terrible for her . ORIAH PEABODY Yep . But she 's tough , like me . We 're mountain people . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Yes ? So are we . ORIAH PEABODY Which mountains ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS On the island of Crete ; it 's very wild and beautiful . You are from where ? p. 67 ORIAH PEABODY The Cumberlands . We come from Neon in Letcher County , Kentucky , Trout an ' me . ' Fore thet , me an ' my fam'ly lived in Upper Beefhide Creek till my man got kilt . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Killed ? ORIAH PEABODY Right in his own bed , after five years a workin ' them damn strip mines . He 'd got laid off fer organizin ' , an ' one afternoon he was sleepin ' when this big ol ' rock got blasted way up in the air , crashed down through the roof a our house an ' hit the bed dead center . NIKOS TOMADAKIS A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the house an ' under the foundation , along with the mattress an ' springs . NIKOS TOMADAKIS I 'm sorry you had to suffer such a horrible ORIAH PEABODY ( She closes her eyes a few moments . ) Worst of it all is Clyde would of hated dyin ' thet way , like a stupid joke , ' stead a fightin ' them coal thugs eye to eye . Which he did sometimes all by hisself . Till he died , an ' I took up his shotgun . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Our people are also brave warriors . Crete has been invaded many times , and we 've had to defend ourselves . ORIAH PEABODY So you were a fightin ' man . p. 68 NIKOS TOMADAKIS No , not I. But my great grandfather was a courageous warrior , very well-known in Crete . ORIAH PEABODY You married ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS No . ORIAH PEABODY Ever bin married ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Smiles . ) I 've come close several times . ORIAH PEABODY Hope you do n't min ' me askin ' . But you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOMADAKIS You 're very perceptive . ORIAH PEABODY Surprises you , do n't it ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS I always have opinions about people before I know who they are . ORIAH PEABODY You ai n't alone . Why , most folks in our country 'd call us ignorant hillbillies . NIKOS TOMADAKIS People often call us wild barbarians . ORIAH PEABODY You got a sartin wildness , but you shorely do keep it wrapped up . Now , if you was with a woman like Trout NIKOS TOMADAKIS Trout ? ORIAH PEABODY Oh , I did n't mean Trout herself . I meant a woman like Trout who got her wildness more on the outside p. 69 TROUT O'DONNELL ( Rages in . She wears a coat and carries her banjo and a purse . ) Grandma , I 'm leavin ' . ORIAH PEABODY Okay , honey . What time you comin ' by tomorra ? TROUT O'DONNELL I 'm not . ORIAH PEABODY No ? ( She nervously twists her yarn . ) How come ? ( THEA enters , smiling and leaning on her cane . She watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Cause I 'm goin ' back home . ORIAH PEABODY Home ? You mean Kentucky ? THEA TOMADAKIS Of course . Alithea . TROUT O'DONNELL Where else ? THEA TOMADAKIS It 's the wrong place . ( NIKOS starts toward THEA , but ORIAH gently stops him . ) ORIAH PEABODY Why ? THEA TOMADAKIS But then , who am I to say ? TROUT O'DONNELL ( Glances at THEA , then back to ORIAH . ) I do n't fit in here . ORIAH PEABODY But you cai n't leave me ! p. 70 TROUT O'DONNELL I do n't want to , but Grandma , you 'll do fine . Ever'one 's real kind to you . I jes ' cai n't take it no more . THEA TOMADAKIS It is n't necessary . TROUT O'DONNELL ( Startled , she looks at THEA . ) See ? She understands . NIKOS TOMADAKIS What does she understand ? TROUT O'DONNELL Fer heavens ' sake ! Open yer eyes . NIKOS TOMADAKIS I am trying . TROUT O'DONNELL Okay . ( Beat . ) Sorry . ORIAH PEABODY If you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How ? With yer broken hip ? ORIAH PEABODY Any way ! Any way atall ! TROUT O'DONNELL ( Starts to cry . ) Oh , Gran'ma ORIAH PEABODY It 's Doc , ai n't it ? TROUT O'DONNELL ( Avoiding NIKOS ' gaze . ) Do n't ask ! I cai n't talk ' bout it ! But I ai n't goin ' to be no phony fer thet man ! ( Turns and gives NIKOS a direct look . ) No man 's ever goin ' to tell me who I ought a be . p. 71 NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Stepping closer . ) You should n't leave here . TROUT O'DONNELL What d' you mean ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS He 's nothing . TROUT O'DONNELL I come all this way NIKOS TOMADAKIS Yes . I have too . Come all this way . TROUT O'DONNELL Was n't worth it . NIKOS TOMADAKIS No ? Do n't be sad . There are always surprises . TROUT O'DONNELL ( Beginning to flirt with him . ) Yeah ? ( Beat . ) Maybe so . THEA TOMADAKIS ( To TROUT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See that one ? You overlook something , and it 's right at the back of our minds . In the cave you can ask only one question . Do n't wait till you are dead and they whisper the truth in your ear . We have no time now . Don't.do.the wrong thing.again . ( Lights slowly out. ) p. 72 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO : Two days later . Evening . THEA TOMADAKIS ( Walking around slowly , leaning on her cane and talking to herself . Most of the bandages have been removed from her hands . ) Now . Let the snakes slide up from their underground chambers . I 'll sit , yes , at the entrance of the cave so the messages can blow past me . ( She sits on chair and holds out her arms . ) ORIAH PEABODY ( Wheels herself in , sees THEA . ) Evenin ' . THEA TOMADAKIS ( Slowly , majestically , lowers her arms . ) Kalispera . ORIAH PEABODY Sure . Any time . THEA TOMADAKIS ( Leans forward , looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in the labyrinth ? So the man can come in and find her ? ORIAH PEABODY Most likely . THEA TOMADAKIS Nonsense . It 's the old ones who are down there , as Charos well knows . ORIAH PEABODY Who 's Charos ? THEA TOMADAKIS How fortunate for you that you have n't met . ( She draws back suspiciously . ) But how did you come down here ? p. 73 ORIAH PEABODY By myself . THEA TOMADAKIS Really ? How curious . ORIAH PEABODY Even though I got this broken hip , I do n't like to have folks doin ' fer me . THEA TOMADAKIS Wounded , then ? Ah . So you must have bribed the old dog . ORIAH PEABODY Which one ? THEA TOMADAKIS ( Laughing delightedly . ) Malista . Quite right . That is a problem people seldom mention . Now , I 'm sure Cerebrus would appreciate three honey cakes , one for each head ORIAH PEABODY Hell , yes . THEA TOMADAKIS ( Quite tickled by what she assumes is ORIAH 's joke . ) Hell , yes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , we 're both pretty new here . THEA TOMADAKIS You may be new , but I have been here for ages . ORIAH PEABODY Do you mind tellin ' where exactly we are ? THEA TOMADAKIS Not at all . It 's easy to get lost in the darkness . This is the northeast corner of the underworld . It is , oh , perhaps thirty kilometres from the river . p. 74 ORIAH PEABODY The river ? Oh , right , it slipped my mind . THEA TOMADAKIS As things so often do . ( Staring with curiosity at the wheelchair . ) How kind of Charon to let you bring your chariot . ORIAH PEABODY Uh , yep , he 's a real nice fella . THEA TOMADAKIS There is simply no accounting for taste . ORIAH PEABODY My name 's Oriah , by the way . THEA TOMADAKIS You mean " Ora , " the golden one . ORIAH PEABODY Well , why not ? THEA TOMADAKIS Why not ? ORIAH PEABODY And yer name is ? THEA TOMADAKIS Now that is a problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Probably under one of these stones . ORIAH PEABODY Want me to help you look around ? THEA TOMADAKIS How kind of you . TROUT O'DONNELL ( Enters , with banjo . ) Hey , Grandma ! I snuck in on Doc 's day off . THEA TOMADAKIS ( Looks at TROUT with pity . ) So young , so young ! Why does it always happen ? p. 75 ORIAH PEABODY You been gone so long I thought you 'd left already . TROUT O'DONNELL You think I 'd leave th'out lettin ' you know ? ORIAH PEABODY No , I s'pose not . Lissen , this here friend a mine 's lost ' er name . Wan na help us look fer it ? TROUT O'DONNELL Uh , sure . ( Sets down her banjo . To THEA . ) I 'm Trout . Oriah 's granddaughter . THEA TOMADAKIS Trout ? Like the fish ? TROUT O'DONNELL Yep . Yer name , hunh ? ( Begins to look under chairs , etc . ) You think you lost it somewheres round here ? THEA TOMADAKIS Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneels down to look under loveseat . ) If you find it , please keep it hidden from the stars . ORIAH PEABODY ( Wheels around looking behind pillows , etc . ) Mebbe here ? Nope . How ' bout here ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Enters , looks first at TROUT , whose rear end is up in the air as she bends over to look behind loveseat , then at his mother on the floor . ) What is going on ? Mama ! ORIAH PEABODY Yer mother lost ' er name , an ' we 're helpin ' ' er to fin ' it . p. 76 NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Helping THEA back to her feet , then into a chair . ) You must n't do things like this . You could break a bone . THEA TOMADAKIS Yannis ! You 've come for me ! NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Pulling back . ) Who ? THEA TOMADAKIS I knew you would understand . You see ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS No . I do n't see . THEA TOMADAKIS I am your Thea . You 've brought me my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does ORIAH , when they hear THEA say her name . ) Oh . Okay . ( Slides back onto loveseat . To ORIAH . ) She found it , Gran'ma . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Yannis ? THEA TOMADAKIS Yes , my beloved gypsy . How many years has it been ? At least three times three times three ! NIKOS TOMADAKIS No , no THEA TOMADAKIS Shhh , my darling one . It 's the evil eye , I 'm sure of it . I looked too long at my face in the mirror , wishing to be beautiful for you . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Mama , I ca n't do this . p. 77 ORIAH PEABODY So , Yannis , we 're real glad you could come down here an ' help Thea find ' er name . NIKOS TOMADAKIS What ? ORIAH PEABODY ' Cause now mebbe you can bring ' er back . ( NIKOS stares at ORIAH uncertainly . ) TROUT O'DONNELL Yannis . Not a bad name . You look like a Yannis . NIKOS TOMADAKIS No , no , I 'm not TROUT O'DONNELL ( Quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go with the flow . THEA TOMADAKIS Yannis , you are alive then ? And you have come for me ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Deciding , he takes her arm . ) Yes , Thea . I have come for you . THEA TOMADAKIS But perhaps I have grown too old ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS Never . You will always be beautiful . THEA TOMADAKIS Ah ! I did wonder . But Charos is possessive , you know . He will never let us leave . I 'm afraid for you it was a mistake to come after me . ORIAH PEABODY Must be some way out . How ' bout a trick ? THEA TOMADAKIS No , I doubt it . But , Trout the fish , what about your lyre ? ( She points to banjo . ) Charos loves music . Could you play for him ? p. 78 TROUT O'DONNELL Well THEA TOMADAKIS He has been known to do anything for a song . NIKOS TOMADAKIS Thea and I would be most happy if you would . ORIAH PEABODY Go , ' head , Trout . How ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Picks up her banjo and sits . The others also sit . She sings . ) How can there be a cherry thet has no stone ? How can there be a chicken thet has no bone ? How can there be a ring thet has no end ? How can there be a baby , there 's no cryen ? ( To each question THEA reacts ; first she is puzzled , then bewildered and finally astonished . ) ORIAH PEABODY Pretty damn good questions , dontcha think ? THEA TOMADAKIS Pretty damn good . ORIAH PEABODY An ' the answers is even better . TROUT O'DONNELL A cherry when it 's bloomin ' , it has no stone ; A chicken when it 's pippin ' , it has no bone ; A ring , when it is rollin ' , it has no end ; A baby when it 's sleepin ' , there 's no cryen . THEA TOMADAKIS I would never have known . p. 79 NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( To TROUT . ) You do have a lovely voice . TROUT O'DONNELL Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ False modesty is useless , my gran'ma useta say . THEA TOMADAKIS ( An uncomfortable silence , as at an awkward family gathering . Then THEA breaks the ice . ) When should you kill a chicken ? TROUT O'DONNELL ( Rolls her eyes at ORIAH . Then : ) When yer hungry . THEA TOMADAKIS No , no . Just after the wedding . ( She takes NIKOS ' arm and smiles radiantly . He writhes in discomfort . ) And how should it be killed ? ORIAH PEABODY You swing it round an ' round till its neck is broke . THEA TOMADAKIS No , the bridegroom must do it with a sharp axe , on the doorstep of the new house . Now , what if you saw a weasel near the house of a girl who was about to be married ? ORIAH PEABODY I 'd scare it away . I 'd yell , " Hoo , weasel ! " till it run off . THEA TOMADAKIS A valiant effort , but too late , you know , because the marriage will never be happy . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Looking over THEA 's head at TROUT . ) More than we imagined . TROUT O'DONNELL ( Quietly , to NIKOS . ) You talkin ' ' bout me or yer mama ? THEA TOMADAKIS But if the white of an egg does n't stay together in the water , we would have known that already , would n't we ? ORIAH PEABODY Why , sure . THEA TOMADAKIS ( With a sly smile . ) What should you cry to a dog barking near your house ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS Na skasis ! ORIAH PEABODY What 's thet mean ? THEA TOMADAKIS ( To NIKOS . ) Tell her , my love . NIKOS TOMADAKIS ( Jumps up , a grand gesture . ) May you burst . THEA TOMADAKIS You could also say NIKOS TOMADAKIS Na fas to kefali sou . THEA TOMADAKIS ( Winks at ORIAH . ) May you eat your own head . TROUT O'DONNELL God damn ! I 'm tryin ' to picture it . p. 81 THEA TOMADAKIS And why do you say these things ? ORIAH PEABODY You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like thet , or somebody 'll up an ' die right near you . THEA TOMADAKIS That 's right ! ORIAH PEABODY ' Course , I would of scared it off with a fry pan . THEA TOMADAKIS My left eye is throbbing . TROUT O'DONNELL What 's thet mean ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS An enemy is near .

THEA TOMADAKIS Ah , Charos ! And will you let us go ? DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS Where do you want to go ? THEA TOMADAKIS Such pretense ! It does n't become you . DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS ( To NIKOS . ) What does she mean ? NIKOS TOMADAKIS She thinks you are Death . p. 82 DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS Mrs. Tomadakis ! What an idea ! THEA TOMADAKIS So . Does your smile mean you are pleased with the riddles and the singing of the fish ? DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS The fish ? ORIAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FREDRICK STRAUSS Oh , yes , I love Trout 's singing .

DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS Thank you . ( To NIKOS . ) How do you say it ? p. 83 NIKOS TOMADAKIS May your mother-in-law die like a dog . DOCTOR FREDRICK STRAUSS What ? ORIAH PEABODY C'm on , Doc .
