Section : Special report ; Cover story The word was the Ia Drang would be a walk . The word was wrong <p> As the sun rose on Nov. 14 , 1965 , a clear , hot Sunday , four U.S. Army helicopters flew , as unobtrusively as such machines can , across the rugged Ia Drang Valley in South Vietnam 's Central Highlands . Below them was a wild and desolate place that in normal times offered a living only to elephants , tigers and a few Montagnard tribesmen . Lt. Col. Harold G. Moore scanned the terrain intently , scribbling notes and marking his maps . He was about to lead the U.S. 7th Cavalry on its most audacious charge since Lt. Col. George A. Custer led his troopers to the Little Bighorn 89 years earlier . <p> Like Custer , Hal Moore had no use for timidity or half measures . The lean , blond Kentuckian , a 43-year-old graduate of West Point , Class of ' 45 , demanded the best from his men and gave the same in return . Behind his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 7th Cavalry Regiment , 1st Cavalry Division ( Airmobile ) , sometimes called Moore by Custer 's nickname , " Yellow Hair . " It was a soldier 's compliment , and Moore took it as such . <p> Moore was hunting big game in the tangle of ravines , tall elephant grass and termite hills around the base of Chu Pong Massif , a 2,401-foot mountain whose forests stretched 5 miles into Cambodia . A month earlier , the 2,200-man 33rd People 's Army Regiment - part of the first full North Vietnamese Army division to take the field since the fall of Dien Bien Phu in 1954 - had attacked the camp at Plei Me , a vital listening post astride the road to Pleiku , the provincial capital . Saigon and Washington feared that if the North Vietnamese overran Pleiku , Route 19 to Qui Nhon on the coast would be wide open , and South Vietnam could be cut in two . But one of the North Vietnamese commanders , Maj. Gen. Huong Minh Phuong , told U.S. News in a recent interview that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap for the inevitable South Vietnamese relief column . The ambush almost certainly would have succeeded but for one new and , for the North Vietnamese , very troubling development . <p> For years , the U.S. Army had sought to free foot soldiers from the tyranny of terrain . Its solution was the helicopter , the ungainly bumblebee that had made a limited debut in Korea . Equipped with the durable UH-1D Huey and its cargo-carrying cousin , the Chinook , and bearing the colors of the 1st Cavalry Division , the first sky troopers had arrived in Vietnam from Fort Benning , Ga. , in mid-September to make the battlefield a three-dimensional nightmare for the enemy . <p> So when the South Vietnamese ventured out to relieve Plei Me , they had moved under an umbrella of howitzers lifted into position by the Chinooks . When the North Vietnamese sprang their ambush , the South Vietnamese had - uncharacteristically - fought like hell . The North 's commander , Gen. Chu Huy Man , withdrew toward the Ia Drang , a sanctuary so far from any road that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival of the air cavalry , no place was safe . It ferreted out North Vietnamese food caches , underground hospitals , even headquarters . " You jumped all over , even into our rear area , ' says General Phuong . " You created disorder among our troops . You made it very hard for our commanders to keep up with the plan . They were very anxious about the psychological effects of your helicopters and artillery leapfrogging among these green troops . ' <p> Hal Moore and his boss , brigade commander Col. Thomas " Tim " Brown , had seen a red star marking Chu Pong Mountain , 17 miles northwest of Plei Me , on an intelligence map at division headquarters . " What 's that ? " they had asked . " A big enemy base camp , " came the reply . Their eyes lit up . For four long days , their men had been beating the brush east of Plei Me and finding nothing but vicious red tree ants , thorny " wait a minute " vines and jungle so dense that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards in an hour . They persuaded their bosses that it made more sense to go where the enemy was . <p> Operating on what Brown later described as " strong instincts and flimsy intelligence , ' Moore was about to hit the jackpot . His battalion of 28 officers and 429 men - four officers and 199 men short of full strength - was about to attack two regiments of North Vietnamese regulars , or more than 3,000 very good soldiers . <p> Moore 's target area contained only three clearings where helicopters could land . One was so small that only two could land at a time ; a second was filled with tree stumps . That left a big clearing that Moore designated Landing Zone X-Ray . It could take eight choppers , but it was located directly beneath Chu Pong Mountain . If the North Vietnamese were occupying the high ground , Landing Zone X-Ray could be a death trap . As the battalion assembled at pickup points around Plei Me Camp , the word was that X-Ray would be one more little walk in the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold showers . The word , as usual , was wrong . <p> At 10:17 , two batteries of 105-mm howitzers - 12 guns that had been deposited by Chinooks in a clearing 6.2 miles east of X-Ray - began firing on X-Ray and , as a diversion , the two other clearings in the area . After 20 minutes , the barrage stopped and helicopter gunships poured .30-caliber machine-gun fire and 2.75-inch rockets into the woods nearby . At 10:48 the first eight Hueys landed at X-Ray . <p> Moore jumped out of the first helicopter with Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley , radio operator Specialist 4 Bob Oullette and a Vietnamese interpreter close behind . Plumley , a laconic West Virginian , was on his third war . He was what young paratroopers admiringly call " a four-jump bastard " - one of the few men who had survived all four World War II combat parachute jumps made by the 82nd Airborne Division . He had jumped again in Korea with the 187th Airborne . <p> The lead elements of Capt . John Herren 's 119-man Bravo Company ran toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second wave of choppers landed . Moore now had nearly 100 men on the ground , but it would be 35 minutes before any of the 16 Hueys assigned to him could return with more troops . If the landing zone came under attack , Herren was his most experienced company commander . He had run Bravo for 18 months , and he knew his men and his business . <p> Moore already was rewriting the rules of helicopter assault landings . Rather than spread his men in a thin circle around the clearing , he kept most of Herren 's troops concealed in a clump of trees near the center of the landing zone , ready to react to any threat , and he sent four six-man squads 100 yards in every direction . Within 30 minutes they captured a prisoner . The straggler said he was a deserter who had been hiding in the brush for five days . His next words were chilling : " There are three battalions on the mountain who want very much to kill Americans but have n't been able to find any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the first men from Capt . Ramon A. Nadal II 's Alpha Company had landed . Tony Nadal was a West Point classmate of Herren 's and an Army brat , the son of Col. Ramon A. Nadal , West Point ' 28 . He had already served in Vietnam with the Special Forces , and when he had heard that the 1st Cavalry Division was headed over , he had driven to Fort Benning and pleaded for a job . Hal Moore made Nadal his intelligence officer , and on the voyage across the Pacific , Nadal had lectured the battalion on what was waiting for them . He got his company in October . <p> Moore believed what the prisoner was saying . He told Herren to push his men toward the mountain , paying particular attention to a finger of high ground that jutted out toward the landing zone . He told Nadal to get ready to move his Alpha Company toward the mountain on Herren 's left , just as soon as enough of Capt . Robert Edwards 's Charlie Company were on the ground to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's footsteps Day 1 : <p> By 1:30 , Capt . John Herren 's men were under attack by about 250 troops , and he radioed that his 2nd Platoon , on the right , was in danger of being cut off . The platoon was commanded by Lt. Henry Herrick , a red-haired Californian fresh out of Officer Candidate School who had joined the division along with a gaggle of other green lieutenants a month before it sailed for Vietnam . In October , after a soldier drowned when Herrick ordered a river crossing without a safety rope , his platoon 's senior man , Sgt. Carl Palmer , had complained to Herren : " Something has to be done about the lieutenant or he 'll get us all killed . ' Herrick was , in the words of an OCS classmate , " a balls-to-the-wall kind of guy - a hard charger . ' <p> This time , Herrick charged too hard . As his platoon trotted up the finger of land , the young lieutenant spotted a few enemy troops . The North Vietnamese fled and Herrick swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were more than 125 yards to the right of the rest of Bravo Company . Seconds later , they ran straight into 150 North Vietnamese headed down the mountain from the west . Herrick 's platoon , which the headline writers would name " the Lost Platoon , " was quickly surrounded . With help from one of Nadal 's platoons led by Lt. W.J. " Joe " Marm , Herren pushed to within 75 yards of Herrick 's position before being driven back . Americans were dropping , wounded and dead , in the dry grass all around . <p> Below on X-Ray , Moore urgently called for air , artillery and helicopter-gunship strikes on the North Vietnamese attack routes down the mountain and sent the rest of Nadal 's men up to reinforce Herren . As Nadal moved toward Herren 's left flank , he ran into 100 to 150 North Vietnamese charging down a dry creek bed - a natural highway that led off the mountain straight to the heart of the landing zone . " They 're PAVN People 's Army of Vietnam , ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-pajama guerrillas pouring off the mountain . They were North Vietnamese regulars in khaki battle dress , their pith helmets camouflaged with clumps of elephant grass . Most were armed with Soviet-made AK-47 rifles , and all carried big pouches full of wooden-handled " potato masher " hand grenades . They also had Maxim heavy machine guns and RPG-2 shoulder-fired rockets . <p> Bill Beck , a 22-year-old machine gunner from Harrisburg , Pa. , was in Nadal 's company . " We were left of the dry creek bed , about 30 yards , and moving forward toward Chu Pong , ' he recalls . " I heard Bob Hazen , the radio operator , yelling about Lieutenant Taft being hit , that he was hit in the neck and bleeding to death . I could see Hazen leaning over Taft when a North Vietnamese blasted him from behind , and I saw his radio explode into pieces . ' A handsome 6-footer from Highland Park , Ill. , 23-year-old Robert Taft was the first young lieutenant to die in the Ia Drang Valley . <p> Out in the landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bob Edwards 's Charlie Company . A native of Trenton , N.J. , Edwards had entered the Army straight from Lafayette College , where he had finished at the top of his ROTC class . He was , in Hal Moore 's view , " a superb and very perceptive leader - aloof and strictly business . ' <p> Moore was deeply worried about his left flank . Lieutenant Herrick 's charge far to the right seemed to have confused the enemy commander ; the North Vietnamese attacks were now shifting to the left , and Moore had to shift with them . He ran into the landing zone under heavy fire , grabbed Edwards at the helicopter door and " yelled at him to run his men toward the mountain , tie in with Nadal 's company on the right and get ready to be attacked in strength . ' The young captain sped off in the direction Moore pointed , waving at his 106 men to follow . Within a few minutes , they had found cover or scraped shallow holes in the woods just off the landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than 550 North Vietnamese slammed into the thin line of waiting American riflemen . <p> Moore and Sergeant Major Plumley had been in constant motion on the battleground and the landing zone , shifting newly arriving troops to where they were needed most . When a new flight arrived , Moore stood in the open , guiding the helicopters to the safest landing spots . " After giving Edwards his orders , I was walking along the line by the creek bed when the firing around my head took on a distinctly different sound - like a hell of a lot of bees , ' Moore remembers . " I felt a firm hand on my shoulder . It was Sergeant Major Plumley , shouting above the noise of the guns : ' Sir , if you do n't find some cover you 're going to go down , and if you go down we all go down . ' ' Moore reluctantly moved to the waist of the figure-8 clearing and set up his command post behind a big termite hill . <p> Landing Zone X-Ray was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very hot . " Maj. Bruce Crandall was in charge of the 16 helicopters assigned to the mission . He and his 6-foot-6 sidekick , Capt . Ed " Too Tall to Fly " Freeman , along with their wingmen , brought reinforcements , ammunition and precious water , and they carried out the wounded . If Moore said it was O.K. to land , they landed . Crandall flew two choppers this day - his first was crippled when it hit a line of trees hauling wounded out of the battle . Crandall vividly recalls one flight : " I saw a North Vietnamese firing at us from just outside my rotor blades 20 feet away . After taking on wounded , I pulled pitch lifted out in a hurry . I had three dead and three wounded , including my crew chief , who was shot in the throat . ' <p> Hanoi 's Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap says his soldiers learned how to fight the U.S. helicopters in the Ia Drang , and perhaps they did . But they did not have the weapons on hand to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they had been deployed on Chu Pong Mountain , could have closed Landing Zone X-Ray . With their rifles and light machine guns , the North Vietnamese took a toll of American aviators , but during three days of battle only two of Crandall 's helicopters were disabled - and both were put back in service after the fight . Later in the war , however , the lessons the North Vietnamese learned at X-Ray would take a heavy toll . <p> Up on the mountain , Henry Herrick 's Lost Platoon was desperately clinging to a 25-yard circle atop a slight rise . The North Vietnamese overran one of the Americans ' two M-60 machine guns . Sgt. Ernie Savage says , " I heard Sergeant Hurdle down there cursing , even over the noise of the firefight . He was famous for that . ' Motherf  --  . Sonofabitch . Sonofabitch , ' I heard him holler . And then they threw grenades in on him . ' Sgt. Paul Hurdle , the platoon 's weapons-squad leader , had survived the retreat from the Chosin Reservoir in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marines , but he did not survive this day . The enemy turned Hurdle 's machine gun around and began using it on the Americans . Herrick was mortally wounded . His last words to Savage were : " I 'm glad I could give my life for my country . ' <p> Command of the 2nd Platoon passed to Sgt. Carl Palmer . Specialist 4 Galen Bungum , who had left a dairy farm in Hayfield , Minn. , for the Army , says that on the way up the mountain Sergeant Palmer said : " Bungum , I 'll be 43 years old tomorrow , but I do n't believe I 'll live to see it . ' Within minutes of taking over , Palmer was shot in the head . Savage and the others laid him behind a log . Shortly afterward , an American hand grenade taken from the slain machine-gun crew sailed over the clearing and exploded beneath Palmer . He died instantly . The mortar forward observer , Sgt. Robert Stokes , assumed it was his turn to take charge , stood up and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was shot through the head and killed instantly . <p> Command of the Lost Platoon fell to Ernie Savage . A 21-year-old buck sergeant from McCalla , Ala. , he had been with the battalion more than two years and was field smart and cool under pressure . He grabbed Stokes 's radio and called artillery fire down in a very tight circle . By then , eight of the Lost Platoon 's 27 men were dead and 12 wounded . <p> Midafternoon . Specialist 4 Vincent Cantu of Refugio , Tex. , had only 10 days left in the Army when he landed in X-Ray . The local draft board had called him up the day before John Kennedy was assassinated , ending Cantu 's fling as lead guitarist and vocalist for the Rockin ' Dominoes , a local band whose theme song was " Born to Lose . " Now an 81-mm mortar gunner , Cantu was riveted by the deadly drama around him . " We were so close our mortar tubes were pointing almost straight up . The pleas over the radio were desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer , with the trapped platoon . By 2:30 or 3 p.m. , it seemed like half the battalion was either dead or wounded . I remember rolling this dead soldier in a poncho . He was face down and when I turned him over I saw the lieutenant 's bars on him . I snapped . I thought : These rounds do n't have any regard . ' <p> By now , Capt . Ray LeFebvre 's Delta Company was arriving at Landing Zone X-Ray . LeFebvre had served an earlier tour and was fluent in Vietnamese . Because of that , he had been tapped for a staff job in civil affairs at division headquarters . Like Tony Nadal , he had turned up on Hal Moore 's doorstep begging for a rifle company . " Something 's going to happen , " LeFebvre had said . " I want to be in on it . " He got his wish . " I started to unhook my seat belt when I felt a round crease the back of my neck , ' LeFebvre remembers . " I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hit in the left side of his head . I grabbed his radio and jumped out ... I fired two magazines of M-16 ammo at the enemy , then I was hit . ' LeFebvre was in action approximately 10 minutes ; in that time , he and four men around him killed 25 North Vietnamese <p> Out near the dry creek bed , machine gunner Bill Beck was doing double duty while his best friend , Russell Adams , poured fire on the enemy . Beck alternated between patching up wounded Americans and firing at the North Vietnamese with a notoriously inaccurate .45-caliber automatic pistol . He spotted Captain LeFebvre , " moaning , his hand blown apart and his thigh equally bad . ' Beck bandaged him up and yelled for a medic . LeFebvre was hauled back to the landing zone , where the battalion intelligence officer , Capt . Tom Metsker , wounded in the shoulder , helped him onto a waiting helicopter . Metsker was hit again and killed at the chopper door . <p> Back on the line , Beck heard someone scream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find his fellow Pennsylvanian lying beside his silent machine gun . " The side of his head was a mess . He was trying to talk to me but nothing was coming out . His helmet lay in front of me with a bullet hole in it , and I turned it over . It seemed like Adams 's entire brain fell out in front of me . I was horrified . I screamed over and over for the medic . ' <p> Beck took over his friend 's machine gun . He was now holding the battalion 's left flank , directly in the path of the enemy . Alone , mumbling every prayer he could remember , Beck stopped them . " They were shooting at me , bullets hitting the ground beside me and cracking above my head . I was firing as fast as I could in long bursts . ' <p> Landing Zone X-Ray was shrouded in thick smoke and dust . " It was a bedlam of men yelling and screaming in English , Vietnamese and Spanish , a constant roar of rifle and machine-gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells and rockets , ' Moore says . He was on the radio to the 3rd Brigade commander , Col. Tim Brown , asking for reinforcements . Brown had a company on alert . <p> Late afternoon . At about 3:45 , Moore ordered Nadal 's and Herren 's companies to pull back , to evacuate their wounded and dead and to prepare for an attack , preceded by air and artillery barrages , to rescue the Lost Platoon . It began at 4:20 . But the enemy had moved forward and dug shallow foxholes ; snipers had climbed into the treetops . " We stood up , got out of the trench and the whole world exploded , ' recalls Lt. Dennis Deal , one of Herren 's platoon leaders . " Men were dropping all over the place . The assault line first went to their knees , and then to a crawling position . ' <p> Deal 's platoon was pinned down by machine-gun fire from a termite hill when suddenly Deal saw " someone get up and charge , just like in a John Wayne movie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open ground while all of us were crawling - the firing was so intense . I saw him throw a grenade behind a termite hill , wait for it to go off , move around to the rear of the termite hill and empty his rifle . Then he fell to his knees . I said to myself : Please get up , whoever you are , do n't be hurt . ' <p> It was Lt. Joe Marm , another Pennsylvanian who was Nadal 's favorite junior officer , another of the batch of green lieutenants who had joined the battalion that summer . Marm had first tried to take out the enemy machine gun with a shoulder-fired light antitank ( LAW ) rocket . Later , he said he charged the machine-gun nest simply " to get the job done and save time . ' He destroyed the gun and killed a dozen North Vietnamese operating and protecting it . As he mopped up the last of the enemy , a sniper round smashed into his face and out through his throat . The medics performed a battlefield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nadal says , " By this time , all my platoon leaders had been killed or wounded and a number of my squad leaders killed . ' Herren 's men gained only about 100 yards ; Nadal 's moved forward 150 . It was now 5:40 , and Moore reluctantly ordered them to pull back again . The artillery batteries had no smoke shells but offered to substitute white-phosphorus shells - the fearsome " Willie Peter " rounds that scattered tiny flaming fragments and laid down a choking cloud of white smoke . <p> Down on the critical left flank , Edwards 's Charlie Company was relatively unhurt but the field in front of it was littered with North Vietnamese bodies . Delta Company had joined the thin line , and the reinforcements that Moore had requested - 120 men of Bravo Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Cavalry under Capt . Myron Diduryk - began arriving shortly after 5 p.m . Sgt. John Setelin , a 21-year-old Virginian , was with them : " As the chopper dropped in , I caught a glimpse of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate if we are bringing in guys without giving them time to change into their fatigue uniforms . Then I realized their rifles were pointed at us ; that was the enemy . When we jumped out , people were firing down on us ; the gooks were up in the trees . ' <p> Nighttime . By 7 o'clock , Moore had his men digging in . For the first time , the Americans encircled the entire landing zone . Until now , Moore had thrown every man he had into a broad semicircle facing the mountain . The back side of X-Ray had been wide open , but , fortunately , no one had come knocking . <p> The wounded got immediate attention from medics , more from the battalion surgeon 's men at Moore 's command post , then were flown as quickly as possible to a clearing station at Camp Holloway in Pleiku set up by C Company of the 15th Medical Battalion - " Charlie Med . " Capt . George Kelling , who ran Charlie Med , recalls : " It was often a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was losing it , while the surgeons tied off the bleeders . We threw caution to the wind and often gave a patient four intravenous cut-downs - with four corpsmen squeezing the blood bags as hard as they could . It was not unusual for the patient to go into convulsions as a reaction to the rapid infusion of so much cold blood . But the alternative was to let him die . ' <p> By dark , all the wounded had been evacuated and the dead collected at Moore 's command post ; ammunition and water had been distributed ; mortars and artillery had been calibrated to fire on a tight ring just 25 yards outside the American lines . Moore now made the rounds . " Morale was high , " he remembers . " We knew we were facing a tough enemy . We had lost a lot of good men , but we had stopped them . ' <p> Up on the slopes of Chu Pong , the Lost Platoon was on its own ; Sergeant Savage had been told that there would be no rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnamese talking and took some comfort from radioing instructions that brought artillery fire down on the voices . During the night , with the wounded pressed into service , too , Savage 's platoon withstood three North Vietnamese attacks , including one launched by eerie bugle calls from the mountain above . <p> After 10 , Crandall and Freeman finally shut down their helicopters at the Turkey Farm , a temporary chopper pad near Pleiku , 37 miles northeast of X-Ray . They and their fellow pilots had flown nonstop since 6 a.m . " When I tried to get out of the aircraft , it caught up with me - my legs gave out , and I fell to the ground vomiting and shaking , ' Crandall recalls . " It took 15 gallons of water to wash the blood out of my first ship , more for the second one I flew that day . ' Moore 's battalion had lost 27 dead and 69 wounded , leaving it with 13 officers and 326 men . The artillerymen at Landing Zone Falcon had fired 4,000 rounds in support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thin green line Day 2 : <p> By first light , at 6:30 , Moore ordered his companies to send out scouts to check for enemy infiltrators and snipers who might have crawled up to the American lines during the night . The scouts from Charlie Company ran into trouble barely 100 yards forward of the line , on the left . <p> Some 300 North Vietnamese , heavily camouflaged and crawling on hands and knees , attacked . The scouts were taking casualties as they tried to pull back . Sgt. Robert Jemison of Columbus , Ga. , recalls : " The patrols sent out early saved us from being surprised . They came running back , yelling , ' They 're coming , Sarge , they 're coming . Lots of ' em . ' Our machine guns and rifles cut them down . ' <p> Pfc . Willie Godboldt was hit and yelled for help . Jemison was leaving his hole when the platoon commander , Lt. John Geoghegan , stood up , saying , " I 'll go . " Geoghegan was shot in the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Military College . He had deferred his Army commitment for two years to earn a master 's degree from the University of Pennsylvania , and in 1964 had married his college sweetheart . John and Barbara Geoghegan spent the next year working for Catholic Relief Services in Tanzania . Their daughter , Camille , was born two months before he left for Vietnam . <p> At 7:15 , Delta Company had come under heavy attack , and X-Ray was under pressure from two sides . " Hand grenades were exploding all around us , ' recalls Sgt. Warren E. Adams . " One fell in the mortar guys ' hole . Sergeant Niemeyer threw a leg over it and his leg was blown off . Nobody else was hurt . I decided the grenades were coming from an anthill nearby , so I grabbed my radio operator and took off with a grenade in each hand and we cleaned up six or eight Vietnamese . ' <p> Specialist 4 Willard Parish , 24 , of Bristow , Okla. , was a Charlie Company mortarman , but this morning he manned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it seemed like the North Vietnamese were growing out of the weeds , ' he remembers . " The training took over . I just fired that weapon , totally unaware of the time , the conditions . I remember a lot of noise , a lot of yelling , air strikes . Then quiet . ' When he ran out of machine-gun ammunition Parish stood up with a .45-caliber automatic pistol in each hand and kept shooting . Later , they counted more than 100 enemy dead in front of his machine gun . Parish was awarded the Silver Star for valor . <p> By now Captain Edwards was urgently calling for reinforcements . As Nadal sent one of his platoons to help Edwards , the North Vietnamese charged Nadal 's own position . The landing zone was now being hit from three sides . Machine-gun fire swept over the landing zone and through Moore 's command post . The colonel 's radio operator , Bob Oullette , a bespectacled young French Canadian , slumped over . The crusty medical-platoon sergeant , Thomas H. Keeton , walked over : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked the hell out of him , told him to get off his ass and help us load the wounded . I picked up his helmet and a bullet fell out of it . It had knocked him cold . ' <p> Moore asked for more reinforcements ; brigade commander Col. Tim Brown had Alpha Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Cavalry on alert . <p> The North Vietnamese were pressing their attack against Edwards 's Charlie Company . " I stood up to observe better and saw the North Vietnamese at a distance of 150 yards , a very large force , ' Edwards recalls . " I saw a couple of them in hand-grenade range moving toward us . I threw a grenade and was shot under the arm and in the back . I did n't lose consciousness , but I could n't stand up . ' Though badly wounded , Edwards remained in command for 3 more hours , until the attack was finally beaten off . Then his radio operator , Ernie Paolone , who was also wounded , dragged him to the aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 24 , was found dead in his foxhole , surrounded by four North Vietnamese he had killed with his bayonet . A fifth , strangled to death , was in the hole with him , with Kroger 's hands locked around his neck . <p> At around 8 , with the North Vietnamese pressing their attacks against Edwards 's Charlie Company and Nadal 's Alpha Company , the Delta Company antitank platoon , which had traded in its unneeded antitank weapons for six .30-caliber M-60 machine guns - each with a full four-man crew and triple the usual load of ammunition - came under heavy attack . The three M-60 machine guns of the reconnaissance platoon also had been added to that sector of the line . " They picked the wrong place , " Moore says . " Adams 's machine guns chewed them up ; they were killing guys 700 or 800 yards out . ' <p> But Landing Zone X-Ray was in grave danger of being overrun . The mortarmen , set up in pits near Moore 's command post , were firing both their 81-mm mortars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One mortar was hit and knocked out . At least two others grew so hot from rapid firing that there was danger of a shell cooking off - exploding before it left the tube . Water was scarce , so the sergeants and their gunners stood and urinated on the mortars to cool them . <p> Moore now ordered the reconnaissance platoon , his last reserve , to counterattack into the Charlie and Delta Company sectors , and he called in the helicopters carrying the Alpha Company , 2nd Battalion , reinforcements . He then pulled Diduryk and one of his platoons back into reserve , on alert to reinforce any section of the line that crumbled . <p> Moore called for all his units to mark their locations for the pilots overhead and the artillery observers by throwing colored smoke grenades . Air Force Lt. Charlie Hastings , the forward air controller , says , " On the second morning , I used the code word for an American unit in trouble and received all available aircraft in South Vietnam for close air support . We had aircraft stacked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to receive a target . ' Two more batteries of 105-mm howitzers were deposited in Landing Zone Columbus , 2.5 miles from X-Ray , putting a total of 24 artillery pieces in support of Moore . As all that blessed relief rained down , an accident came perilously close to wiping out Moore and his command post . An Air Force F-100 Super Sabre jet mistakenly dropped two canisters of napalm into the area . Moore was shouting at Hastings , the air controller , to call off the F-100 pilot 's wingman , who was about to release his napalm , too . <p> Sgt. George Nye of the 8th Engineer Battalion had come in with a small demolition team to help Moore 's battalion . " Two of my people , Pfc . Jimmy D. Nakayama and Specialist 5 James Clark , were a few yards away , and Colonel Moore was hollering something about a wing man and I looked up , ' Nye recalls . " There were two planes , and one had already dropped his napalm . Then everything was on fire . Nakayama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Nakayama died . Three days later , Nye learned that Nakayama 's wife had given birth to a baby girl on the day her husband was killed . Soon afterward , orders came through approving Nakayama 's reserve commission as a second lieutenant . <p> Just after 9 a.m. , with the Alpha Company reinforcements arriving , Moore shifted Diduryk 's men into the battered line held by what was left of Edwards 's Charlie Company . Sergeant Setelin remembers crawling along that line finding foxhole after foxhole filled with dead Americans . By 10 , the enemy attack had been beaten off . Edwards and his men had held . <p> Afternoon . Three hours later , Moore ordered all four companies on the line to move out 300 yards to the front and police the battleground . Dead North Vietnamese and their weapons littered the area . Some enemy dead were neatly stacked behind the termite hills ; thick trails of blood marked where others had been dragged away . More than 40 dead Americans were recovered and evacuated . What was left of Charlie Company was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , the brigade commander , Colonel Brown , had moved the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Cavalry , led by Lt. Col. Robert Tully , to Landing Zone Victor , 2 miles from X-Ray , and told them to reinforce Moore . By noon , they were closing in on Moore 's position , and what they saw stunned them . Sergeant Adams was on the line when the first of Tully 's men marched in . " My God , there 's enemy bodies all over this valley , ' the newcomer shouted . " For the last 30 minutes , we 've been walking around and over and through bodies . ' <p> Moore now ordered a two-pronged attack - by two companies of Tully 's men across the slope of Chu Pong and by Herren 's Bravo Company to rescue the Lost Platoon . Herren 's men reached the knoll at 3:10 . " When I got there I walked over to where Henry Herrick was lying dead , ' Lieutenant Deal recalls . " It seemed so unnatural for my friend to be lying stomach down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ; I did not want to remember him that way . But I have . ' Sergeant Savage had not lost a single man after taking command , despite a long night and day of attacks . When Herren 's men told them that it was safe to get up , not one of them moved for 5 minutes . " They just stared at us in disbelief , ' Deal says . <p> Nightfall . With his reinforcements , Moore beefed up the lines . His tally showed that on Day Two his battalion had lost two officers and 44 men killed , three officers and 22 men wounded ; the four line companies were down to eight officers and 260 men . Charlie Company had started the day with five officers and 102 men and ended it with no officers and 45 men . A bright moon rose in a clear sky before midnight and lighted the battlefield . CHECKMATE : Driving off the enemy Day 3 : <p> At 4:22 , an estimated 300 North Vietnamese attacked Capt . Myron Diduryk 's sector from the southeast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had emigrated to the United States at age 12 , was , in Moore 's words , " the best battlefield company commander I 've ever known , including myself in Korea . ' <p> Diduryk had prepared for the possibility of a night attack . His men were dug in deeply , two to a foxhole , and the holes were spaced to provide interlocking support . Before nightfall Diduryk and his artillery observer , Lt. William Lund , had registered the artillery ranges so the 105-mm howitzers at Landing Zones Falcon and Columbus could fire instantly . Now , by the light of parachute flares kicked out of an Air Force C-123 overhead , Diduryk 's men poured rifle and machine-gun fire on the attacking North Vietnamese while Diduryk and Lund directed artillery fire back and forth across the killing zone . The North Vietnamese broke and ran . <p> Nine minutes after the first attack , they tried again , this time with about 200 men . Again , American artillery and rifle fire chewed them up . The attack shifted to the southwest . The North Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard bugles blowing , ' says Specialist 4 Pat Selleck , a 24-year-old rifleman from New York City . " I saw , in the light of the flares , waves of the enemy coming down off the mountain in a straight line . The company was shooting them like ducks in a pond . ' Twice during the attacks , Moore 's reconnaissance platoon had carried huge loads of ammunition out to Diduryk 's men . Less than 2 hours later , at 6:27 , the North Vietnamese attacked again , this time directly at Diduryk 's command post . Now , in less than 15 minutes , the attackers were dragging off their dead . Diduryk had only six men lightly wounded , but the field in front of him was piled with enemy dead . Diduryk would return to Vietnam for another tour of duty with the 1st Cavalry . In the spring of 1970 , in another landing zone , he was killed by a sniper . <p> Moore now invented something that would be widely used for the rest of the Vietnam War . Finding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man on the line , on a signal at 6:55 , to shoot anything in front of their lines that worried them . When this " Mad Minute " of random firing began , 50 North Vietnamese leapt up 150 yards forward of Alpha Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Cavalry . The North Vietnamese had been sneaking up and assumed the firing meant they had been spotted . They were shot down . Elsewhere along the line , the " reconnaissance by fire " killed six other North Vietnamese , including two snipers shot out of the trees . A third sniper was spotted an hour later trying to climb down and get away . He , too , was killed . <p> At 9:55 , Moore ordered the nine companies now on the line to move forward 500 yards . Within the first 50 yards , Diduryk 's men came under heavy fire . Moore pulled them back and called in artillery and air bombardment that killed another 27 of the enemy . The rest of the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Cavalry , under Lt. Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zone Victor . Specialist 4 Jack Smith , now an ABC-TV correspondent , later wrote : " The 1st Battalion had been fighting continuously for three or four days , and I had never seen such filthy troops . They all had that look of shock . They said little , just looked around with darting , nervous eyes . Whenever I heard a shell coming close , I 'd duck but they kept standing . There must have been about 1,000 rotting bodies out there , starting at about 20 feet , surrounding the giant circle of foxholes . ' <p> McDade 's and Tully 's battalions were to relieve Moore 's men at X-Ray , but Moore did not hand over his position until every company had accounted for every one of its men . Long ago , at Fort Benning , he had promised his battalion that he would never leave a man on the battlefield , never permit one man to be carried as " missing in action . " <p> In three days and two nights , his battalion and attached units had lost 79 killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,300 dead . Approximately 400 American air sorties had been flown in close support , the artillerymen at Landing Zones Falcon and Columbus had fired some 18,000 shells , and helicopter gunships had fired 3,000 2.75-inch rockets . Before Moore 's men left , they were treated to one last spectacular . Shortly after noon , Chu Pong erupted as 24 Guam-based B-52 strategic bombers , for the first time in history , bombed in close support of troops on the ground . <p> Finally , Moore gave the O.K. , and the helicopters began lifting his men out of the valley . Hal Moore , the first man on the ground , was the last man of his battalion to leave . In the cockpit of the helicopter that carried him away were his old pilot buddies Bruce Crandall and Jon Mills . After they landed at Camp Holloway in Pleiku , Moore checked to make certain his men were being taken care of and then rejoined the pilots . " Where can we get a drink around here ? ' he asked . Crandall and Mills pointed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gin and tonic , but the bartender refused to serve them , pointing disdainfully at Moore : " He 's too dirty . " Moore unslung his M-16 rifle and laid it across the bar ; Crandall and Mills sighed and pulled out their .38-caliber pistols . " You 've got exactly 30 seconds to get some drinks on this bar or I 'm going to clean house , ' Moore said through clenched teeth . They drank , and when it dawned on the crowd who their unwashed and unwanted guest was , they drank for free . <p> To this point , the Ia Drang Campaign had been a magnificent feat for the cavalry . But before the fighting ended another 155 Americans would die in the Ia Drang Valley . AMBUSH : Blundering into disaster Day 4 : <p> On the morning after Moore 's battalion left X-Ray , with another massive B-52 raid planned on Chu Pong , the two battalions that had relieved Moore 's men - Bob McDade 's 2nd Battalion of the 7th Cavalry and Bob Tully 's 2nd Battalion of the 5th Cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The brigade commander intended to continue maneuvering to block the enemy 's retreat and to destroy him . <p> Tully , an experienced commander , marched his men out of X-Ray the same way they had arrived : Two companies abreast with artillery fire pounding the brush ahead of them . In less than 2 hours , his men covered the 2 1/2 miles to Landing Zone Columbus . But McDade , who only three weeks before had been the division 's personnel officer , had not commanded troops in 10 years . Staff officers needed a battalion command in order to make colonel , and Maj. Gen. Harry W.O . Kinnard had given McDade his battalion , but not without reservations . He had sent his personal aide , Maj. Frank Henry , to serve as McDade 's second-in-command and to " keep things going till McDade could get his feet wet . ' <p> As Tully , who had left first , neared his objective at Landing Zone Columbus , he radioed McDade and offered to have his artillery specialist relay the correct coordinates to McDade 's artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection on the way out of X-Ray . McDade said it was n't necessary and moved out . <p> McDade 's lead unit , Alpha Company , was deployed in a wedge formation , and the rear guard - a company borrowed from the 1st Battalion of the 5th Cavalry - was also properly deployed , but those in between marched single file with little regard for security . Some men had gone two days and nights without sleep , and during their frequent stops they sprawled , exhausted , in the grass . <p> The 8th Battalion of the 66th People 's Army Regiment was taking a rice break at midday along the Ia Drang River when scouts reported that the Americans were approaching . McDade 's lead unit captured two prisoners , and the Americans halted for 20 minutes while they were interrogated . That permitted the enemy commander time to set up a hasty L-shaped ambush . The North Vietnamese planted their machine guns atop the termite hills and raced through the jungle , drawing the long leg of the L alongside the Americans . <p> As their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American column wheeled and attacked . In the center of the column , Charlie Company took the worst of it , losing 20 killed and many more wounded in the first minute . Some men fired wildly in every direction and another company complained it was being hit by friendly fire . At that point , as the enemy pressed the attack , McDade apparently believed that what was happening was a shootout between Americans . Lt. S. Lawrence Gwin wrote that McDade radioed orders for everyone to cease fire . <p> A bad situation got worse . By now , the North Vietnamese were in among the Americans and up in the trees . Anyone who moved got shot . Major Henry and the artillery observer got on their radios and began calling in artillery and air bombardments . That prevented a massacre , but with the column stretched out for almost 1,000 yards in the tall grass , the artillery shells and napalm that killed the North Vietnamese also killed Americans . The lead unit , Alpha Company , had spread out around the edge of the clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the first minutes . It would emerge from Albany with only 20 men left out of 100 . Charlie Company , which set off from X-Ray with 110 men , lost 50 killed and 50 wounded . <p> In late afternoon , Diduryk 's Bravo Company , which had left X-Ray with Moore 's men , was pulled out of Pleiku and dropped by helicopter into Albany . The cocky veterans of X-Ray drew a perimeter around the clearing and lent courage to the shaken defenders . Another company of the 1st Battalion of the 5th Cavalry marched from Landing Zone Columbus toward the tail end of McDade 's half-mile-long column . <p> During the afternoon and night , the North Vietnamese roamed the battlefield , killing and being killed in desperate , isolated little incidents . Specialist 4 Jack Smith , who lay wounded in the grass , wrote that the enemy ran around " screeching with glee when they found one of us alive ... Every few minutes , I heard some guy start screaming ' no , no , no , please , ' and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblivious to the debacle . General Kinnard and his second-in-command , Brig . Gen. Richard Knowles , later said the brigade commander , Colonel Brown , had not alerted them . Brown said he could get no coherent report from McDade . " We had ample resources at hand to reinforce Albany - Hal Moore 's men would have gone in a minute - but no one asked , ' says General Kinnard . SILENCE : Counting the cost Day 5 : <p> When the sun rose , McDade 's battalion had lost 155 killed , 125 wounded and at least five men missing in action . A lieutenant stood in front of Specialist 5 Jon Wallenius , a Bravo Company mortar observer , and asked for volunteers to bring in the American dead . First they brought in the whole bodies ; then the pieces . Wallenius and the others dragged the ghastly cargo to waiting Chinook helicopters , stacking the last one full to the ceiling . " When we raised the tail ramp , blood poured through the hinges , ' he says . <p> Landing Zone Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , one of the Americans missing in action , Pfc . Toby Braveboy , a South Carolinian of Creek Indian descent , staggered into a clearing and , with his bloody undershirt , waved down a passing helicopter . Braveboy had been badly wounded on November 17 , played dead while the enemy executed others near him and then crawled off to a creek bed . On the third day , the last man in a squad of North Vietnamese troops passing by spotted Braveboy lying in the brush against the bank and turned , raising his AK-47 rifle to finish him off . Braveboy lifted his shattered left hand in supplication , shaking his head . " He was so young , just a boy , not more than 16 or 17 , ' Braveboy recalled afterward . " He walked away . " EPILOGUE : Delivering the sad news <p> The guns were silent at last . But 12,000 miles away , in Columbus , Ga. , the sleepy Southern town outside Fort Benning , the tragedy was just beginning to unfold . It was early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualty-notification teams that later delivered and tried to soften the terrible news . The telegrams were simply handed over to taxi drivers to deliver . Some women collapsed at the sight of a cab pulling up outside ; others huddled inside , refusing to answer the knock . <p> Lt. Col. Hal Moore and his men had done their duty in the Ia Drang Valley . Now Julia Compton Moore - the daughter of an Army colonel , the wife of a future Army general and the mother of two sons who would follow their father to West Point - would do hers . Julie Moore knocked on too many doors in the flimsy thin-walled apartment complexes and trailer parks around Columbus - grieving with the women , comforting the children and wondering when the taxicab might come to her door . She never forgot one very young , Hispanic widow , pregnant with a baby who would come into this world fatherless . Julie Moore attended the funerals of all her husband 's men who were buried at Fort Benning . <p> If you want to know the true cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> U.S. News Senior Editor Joseph L.
