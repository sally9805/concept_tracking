<p> What - besides John Denver 's music - did the Mountain time zone ever do to the rest of America ? <p> From Denver out to Salt Lake City , from Billings , Mont. , down to Truth Or Consequences , N.M. , this just might be the most dissed , most misunderstood , most ignored region in the country . <p> Let 's start with those deep-voiced TV teasers for upcoming shows : ' Be sure to catch ' World 's Scariest Explosions ' at 9 Eastern , 8 Central , and 6 on the West Coast . ' <p> Hello ? We like scary explosions out here in the Mountain time zone , too . What about us , doggone it ? <p> Face it : a lot of folks back east and out west - including loads of media moguls - do n't have the foggiest idea what actually lies in the Mountain time zone . Many do n't really even know where it is , or at least what its boundaries are . <p> And if they 're phoning from New York or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the time here . <p> ' If I had $ 5 for every time somebody from another time zone asked me , ' What time is it there ? ' I 'd have an endowment , ' says Patty Limerick , a western historian at the University of Colorado at Boulder . <p> This includes even highly educated people . One morning , the phone at Limerick 's home rang at 6 a.m. sharp . National Public Radio producer Art Silverman was calling from Washington , D.C. , for an interview . <p> ' He said , ' Now just what time is it there ? ' I said , ' Wow . ' <p> ' I think there 's probably considerable capacity in these people to be able to subtract one or two hours . I think they can do that , ' Limerick says . <p> But they do n't know where we are . ' It 's like , are we near Chicago ? ' <p> To his credit , Silverman admits he ca n't always do time-zone math on the fly . <p> ' I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the only time zone , to an Easterner at least , that describes an elevation as opposed to a place on the map . ' Mountain ' sounds like it 's a time you go into if you climb up something . ' <p> If there is a media or Eastern bias against the Mountain zone , Silverman says , maybe it lies in those semantics . In other words , they just do n't like the name . <p> ' It does n't really fit with the rest . I mean , it does n't seem geographical . A lot of Easterners do n't think there 's a part of the country that 's so defined by mountains that it would deserve to be the name of a whole region , ' he says . <p> Often called ' the forgotten time zone , ' it truly is the Rodney Dangerfield of regions . You can hear the one-liners now : <p> ' Good crowd , good crowd . Say , the other day I looked up the Mountain time zone in America 's family tree and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no respect . No respect at all . <p> ' We may hold the high ground topographically , but not in terms of with the media , ' says Bill Riebsame , editor of the ' Atlas of the New West ' and geography professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder . <p> ' It 's seen as that sort of empty quarter , the outback , ' Riebsame says . <p> What is the Mountain time zone ? Officially , it blankets six states and includes small chunks of seven others . Among its cities are Phoenix , Boise , Albuquerque and , of course , Denver . <p> But to some folks elsewhere , the Mountain zone is envisioned as a desolate , wind-blown stretch of rectangular states filled with tumble weeds , varmints and the occasional Super Bowl champion . <p> The three other U.S. mainland time zones have clear identities . The Eastern is packed with skyscrapers , industrial smokestacks and Atlantic beaches . The Central is the breadbasket , the heartland , town squares and wheat fields . The Pacific is sunny Hollywood , swaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northwest . <p> But the Mountain zone ? Much of the rest of America seems to think it 's just where the deer and the antelope play . <p> ' I think those misconceptions imply that they even give it a second thought . And I think the truth is , they do n't , ' says Baxter Black , cowboy poet , philosopher and a current resident of Benson , Ariz . <p> It 's all about numbers - or the lack thereof , Black believes . Of the entire U.S. population , just 4 percent reside in the Mountain zone . The lion 's share of those people live in urban areas like the Front Range , but to some marketers and media , it 's all a big dust bowl . <p> ' It 's that very statistic , ' Black says . ' And I guess when you stop and think about it , that 's the way I would do it , too . ' <p> Nowhere is that cold shoulder more evident than in the TV world , where Mountain time is often left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ' People - both friends and viewers - certainly mention it to me , ' says Wendy Holmes , program director at KCNC-Channel 4 . ' But one thing people always tell me is how ( CBS football announcer ) Greg Gumbel always mentions the Mountain time zone programs that are coming up after the broadcasts . They really appreciate that . And he seems to be the only one who does it . ' <p> Part of the problem , Holmes says , is there are only 30 CBS affiliates in the Mountain zone out of 200 nationally . That 's just 15 percent . <p> The other issue , she says , is a frame of reference based on New York City . Few people from that metropolis ever gravitate to other parts of the country ; to them the world ends at the outer limits of the 212 area code . The same has been said of folks in Washington , D.C. , and their ' beltway mentality . ' <p> And in those two cities reside the bulk of the American media . <p> National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time zone . Only rarely do viewers here get the freshest-possible versions of the day 's events . <p> For example , ' Good Morning America ' often provides just a Pacific zone update for its taped news ' feed . ' When the Columbine tragedy was unfolding , however , the honchos at ABC updated their broadcast for this time zone . It was the first time they had done that in decades . <p> ' You see it on the Weather Channel or surfing the Web if you 're trying to get real-time information . It 's oriented toward just the coast - the East or maybe the Midwest , where the bulk of the population is , ' says ' New West ' editor Riebsame . <p> ' They get pride of place , the West Coast gets second status , and we get jumped over They are dividing the country into thirds , not fourths . ' <p> As Riebsame 's book points out , however , this thinking is misguided . <p> The Mountain time zone was the fastest-growing region of the country in the 1990s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico have had the hottest rate of population increases in America over the last 10 years , accompanied by waves of new jobs . <p> ' You 'd think more respect from the media outlets might be coming , ' Riebsame says . <p> ' We all know this is kind of a modern and hyperconnected part of the country . Sun Microsystems is n't moving here because it 's the outback . Just the opposite . But everyone has friends on the coasts who adhere to old notions as to what the interior here is like . ' <p> CU historian Limerick , for example , recently appeared at a Tattered Cover Book Store in Denver to discuss one of her works . Her New York City publicist was generous enough to offer to send Limerick a plane ticket - so she would n't have to pay for the flight from Boulder to Denver . <p> ' She just thought , ' Limerick says , " Oh , this person is from Colorado , " which is a vast prairie where everything is far-flung . <p> That publicist is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' I just think of the East Coast and West Coast when I think of time zones , ' admits Colleen Dionne , a Massachusetts-based research analyst for a public relations-oriented company called Mediamap . <p> Dionne spends her work hours calling journalists all over America . Yet when asked to name any of the 13 states that lie partly or completely in the Mountain zone , she could only come up with four . <p> ' Well there 's Colorado , Utah not Arizona , no . Montana ? ' Dionne responded . ' I do n't know . Gosh , I 'm trying to think but I ca n't think of anything else . I 'm just thinking of the states on the West Coast . ' @p#
