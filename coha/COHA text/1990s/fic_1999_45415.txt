Like a balloon jerking the end of its string , like a kite straining the end of its tether , Daisy jumped into the first steps of the polka , and the one-two-three that clicked in her head like a too-loud clock during her lessons stopped and the foolish sweet words of the polka took its place . <p> Those words were the invitation she had listened for so often , the Shall-We-Dance ? she used to think was an invitation to life , and so it was entrancing to hear the words now , as she danced in her second competition , and to remember the governess in the musical , wearing an improbably beautiful full-skirted dress , swinging out in the arms of the prince-or was he a king ? - as Daisy in her improbably beautiful blue satin dress ( which she could n't afford , which she had bought as a challenge to herself , her ability to wear it , to pay for it ) swung out in the arms of the teacher . <p> The eye of his energy was , for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching her , he spoke of spotlights on the front of her rib cage which should always shine directly at him , but such descriptions were not for now , not for the competition ) . The eye of his energy reminded her of the red eyes on electronic devices , VCRs , computers , which shone steadily all night in the dark . That his energy was small was not at all what she meant by the comparison ( she was a poet , by avocation , and a teacher , she was always making exact comparisons ) but that it was intensely focused , red , and heatless . <p> It was not the same energy she imagined radiating from the king in the song , who had intentions , who would move from the polka with the governess to something else with the governess . For both of those figures , dancing had consequences , which in this high hot ballroom on the West Coast of the country could not be for Daisy and the teacher . The rules of the exchange made it sweet , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twentieth century , there were no rules . <p> She had thought these thoughts when she was dressing , earlier in the day ( the amateur events began at eight A.M. , and so she and her friends were up in the dark , curling their hair and applying make-up ) . These thoughts had run along on their tiny pattering feet while she put on clothes she had never worn for any other occasion , net stockings and skin-colored underpants and push-up bra ( how she would have scorned that , when she was younger ) , choker necklace and glittering earrings ( no bracelets ; bracelets clatter ) , rouge and lipstick and eyeshadow . " No daughter of mine , " her mother would have said to all that , many years ago when Daisy was meant in spite of her name to be serious , but her mother was dead and her rules were falling like leaves after the first frost . <p> Now in the first steps of the polka she was only movement ; she was the tendon behind her knee unknotting itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her foot lifting , her toes pointing . Her legs , which served her faithfully in the regular ups and downs of her life , were now doing more than their duty , negotiating a sort of hop . To the side she stepped and her blue skirt , rustling , shining , fell against the legs of her partner 's black trousers although neither of them could feel that , the skirt 's soft , sleek lick along the dark wool ; certainly Daisy could not feel the light contact of his legs , through those layers , although she could feel that her right hand was closed inside his left hand and that she was leaning left , always left , in order to fill the curve of his right arm . <p> Did she imagine it or had the ballroom with its crowded tables , purses left hanging on chair backs , half-empty glasses of water , cameras , make-up kits-had the ballroom in fact fallen silent ? There had been many events already , although it was only nine o'clock in the morning , many hopeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers , walking out onto the floor and taking up frozen positions , waiting for their music to start . So why should the chatter stop when this one couple , or rather , this one woman  --  Daisy-with the teacher who danced with so many , took to the floor ? <p> She felt it was the speed of their trajectory across the smooth , dull  --  gold floor ( laid down in squares , she knew , hours earlier ) , what was called , in the dance language , Body Flight ; again , something she had never known she possessed . <p> For they were flying , really . The contact of the soles of her blue satin shoes with that smooth , dull-gold surface was lighter than the contact of a falling leaf with the wind ; and she remembered one of her friends , a brown-eyed , fresh-faced dress designer , telling her that in Argentine Tango a sheet of paper , of tissue paper , even , should always have space to glide between the dancer 's heel and the floor . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the next after Newcomer ) , but still Daisy felt that a sheet of tissue paper , the fine white kind that used to come in expensive dress boxes , could have slid easily at any moment between the floor and the heels of her satin shoes . Because really she was flying . <p> On a Light Cloud of Music , Shall We Fly . <p> And what was he doing , her teacher , with his flat , obscure and obscuring face , his pliable spine and small , warm hands ? He was not pushing , he was not exerting any force on her bare back , where his right hand was poised , the fingers slightly splayed , the thumb at an angle ; he was certainly not exerting any pressure on her right hand , which he held cupped like an egg ( a small egg ) inside his left hand . <p> No , what it seemed he was doing-and she knew , after all the lessons , she did not really understand what he was doing ; it was an art , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with the intensely focused , heatless light of his energy ; so that perhaps he imagined her steps , the pattern she followed , even before she started . <p> At least that was what she thought when she believed that she stood out from the crowd of his students , all of them eager , hardworking-or complaining , some dropping away finally into the heart of their complaints : that he did n't give them enough time , that he broke appointments . And all of them knowing-at least Daisy thought they knew-that their complaints ( and perhaps also their eagerness , their willingness to work hard ) came out of their long pasts and had no connection to the present at all ; which did not ease them or cool their complaining . <p> She did not name to herself what exactly he , the teacher , stood for in all their pasts ( so similar , although they came from different classes , different parts of the country ) because there was no need to name it . They all , in their ways , understood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now her steps were skimming alongside his , as though the angle of their connection was altered ; as indeed of course it was altered , if not outright destroyed , at the end of every dance . <p> For they only knew each other as student and teacher , in the fifty  --  five minute hours of their sessions , and Daisy , who had spent so many **25;718;TOOLONG hours trying to explain herself to a silent professional who sat across a desk or at the end of a hard couch , wondered why she 'd wasted so much money and time-her parents ' money , her time-trying to find out how to swing out like a kite at the end of its tether , or a balloon , a sky-blue balloon , she thought , because in spite of her attempt , all her life , to be serious , she was really , she knew , a laughing woman , one of those who make people stare in bars and restaurants because she throws her shoulders back , her head back , ( the shoulders bare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and laughs , open mouthed , as women do n't laugh except , maybe , in private . <p> Not that she was laughing now , but the smile that changed her face , seeming to light it from her high hairline to her pointed chin , appeared immediately in response to the music and the steps . <p> Perhaps that was what the people at the tables were looking at , what had reduced them , for a minute , to silence : her smile . Certainly it was not her feet , or his , or the pattern of the dance , so <p> familiar any change came as a shock ( people sliding , people failing to execute turns ) . No , it could only be the singular light that made her face the face of a young girl-a debutante , one of her friends , meaning no harm had called it ; and this friend was a brilliant woman , peering like a kindly vulture through her thick glasses . <p> Debutante was not what Daisy would have called her look , in fact she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but simply to garner the praise of strangers in the hall , afterward , who told her as she swam toward the bathroom , " You look like you 're having such a good time "  --  <p> which meant , of course , they did n't know about the screaming inside her . <p> But why should they know about the screaming inside her ? Now , as they whirled around the corner of the floor , she wondered if even those silent professionals behind their desks or otherwise arranged to listen had heard her scream ; or if they had , had they tried to do something about it ? <p> She had been no more depressed , as a young woman , than most young women who find the grown-up world incomprehensible , alien , demanding choices they do not want-do not know how-to make : love versus work , achievement versus children , and so on . <p> And Perchance , When The Last Little Cloud Has Left The Sky . Because of course there was always a choice to be made . Even now , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn her here , or there . Her choice , dancing , did not seem to be a choice at all , because she was merely following ( and she knew he , the teacher , would not call it merely , since it went against most of what women learned in life ) ; she was tuning the muscles in her arms , back and legs to follow his ; although that was not an evocative way of describing it . The old lead-follow , one of her less enchanted friends called it ; the old lead  --  follow , as though they , his women partners , were cows pulled along on the end of a rope . <p> But it was not that at all , she thought-and now they were were around the corner and tearing down the straightaway- , it was more the way the left hand follows the right across the keyboard , or the way the piano underscores the singer 's voice , or the way light leaves the sky at evening-something almost imperceptible , which can not , in the end , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right when it might as well be said to lead it ? Is the singer 's voice the cue to the pianist , or the other way around ? And as to the way light leaves the sky , there is no one who can say exactly when it is gone , when the sky becomes entirely dark . The line is so fine . The line is always so fine . That is one of the rules . <p> Shall We Still Be Together With Our Arms Around Each Other . <p> Actually , she knew , his arms were not around her . It was more of an arc , a balanced meeting , as though their arms , tOgether , made a complete circle , somewhat flattened : an ellipse . If his arms were actually around her , she would have felt caged ; as it was , this light clasp-was clasp the word ? And she remembered how she labored over each word in her poems , which were often published in good literary quarterlies . <p> No , clasp is a verb with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the clasp on a bracelet . This was looser . And yet she did not understand , could not begin to explain , how a loose connection conveyed so much . <p> Most loose connections , she thought , are connections fraying , falling apart . Her marriage had been like that . And truthfully there had been some relief in that looseness , which meant less was demanded , of both of them ; simply politeness , occasionally a word , a smile-but not the smile that irradiated her face now . ( " Your smile , " the DJ would say later-he was a young man with very blond hair  --  " Your smile is what they all need , " and she would want him to say , instead , it 's your grace , your precision . <p> But when the marriage connection finally fell apart completely , leaving nothing behind , not even anger , or regret , Daisy had thought that was what life intended : a coming together , a clasp , and then a fraying and falling apart . And had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clasped , tightly , as in the words of the marriage ceremony , or to be dropped out of connection like a wet flannel nightgown sagging off a clothes line . <p> Both equally awful . And she had avoided that sort of thing ever since because there is always the morning light , even in a small window above a cool bed , there is always that time in the evening when you do n't know whether or not it is dark . <p> And Shall You Be My New Romance . <p> Turning , again , around the floor , she was sure of the audience 's attention , now , and felt that it was caused not by her smile but by the rays of their energy-the teacher 's , and hers-which had a perceptible effect , like the heat from a stoked wood stove . <p> But that heat must radiate from every dancing couple , she thought , not wanting to claim to be special , because she had learned in her life to plead only the ordinary : I am this , and not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something unaccountable , out of the ordinary , in the way his splayed fingers on her . bare back communicated , through her skin-although in fact she could barely feel his fingers , so light was his touch-perhaps there was something individual , and marked , to their partnering . <p> Beware , she thought , of that , because it is in insisting on difference , on specialness , that the whole equation falls apart , although as a gifted poet she would never accept the word , equation , as descriptive of their dancing . <p> No , say instead all the light drained out of it , when she sought to be special ; the darkness came down , fast . Because he taught many women , better dancers than she ( and she knew that , recognized it , painfully , seeing the skillful way they shaped to his arm or pointed their high-arched feet ) and if she was to begin to feel that she was different , special , it would simply ruin it all . <p> On The Still Understanding That This Kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he swung her out , and the swinging was a little like the wide swing of a farm gate-she knew that , and regretted it-because she had lost his lead . But she felt her hand inside his hand as he flung her out ; she was not separated , completely ; and so she was able to catch her balance and swing in again , on time . <p> Keeping time was , he often told her , the most important thing ; the judges with their clipboards would note that , first , and if they were off , they would never see anything else . ( Certainly , the judges would not notice her smile . ) So she was on time and back in dance position , and she found the crest of his right shoulder with the fingers of her left hand and felt , for the first time , the seam where the shoulder of his densely tailored tail coat ( made for dancing , only ) met the stiff narrow sleeve . <p> It seemed more real than a vein , somehow , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers rested , even clung there , for the dance was coming to an end . <p> He never said to her-or to any of the others , the hard workers , the complainers- , " Do n't cling . " These were words that did not belong in his vocabulary , although she 'd heard through the grapevine that certain students were not invited back when it was time for them to sign new contracts ( and these contracts , for sets of dance lessons , were notoriously expensive ) . <p> But her fingers tapping lightly along the line of his seam were , as far as she was concerned , a slightly overlapping gesture-overlapping the bonds of what was accepted , between them ; although she knew he could not possibly feel her fingers tapping through all that stiff material . <p> Shall We Dance . <p> Their music was coming to an end , now , the blond DJ was already cuing up the next number , and she felt the teacher turn away as she stretched to curtsey ( that curtsey her mother would have preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the cooler air . <p> The small red eye of his attention was already redirecting itself toward his next partner , her friend , the vulture , who was a fine dancer although her important job left her little time to practice . And she knew he , the teacher , enjoyed dancing with this bright , straight  --  forward woman , who did not wear lipstick or curl her hair ; and they would do a Paso Doble that would be without layers of meaning , that would be crisp and clear . <p> He folded Daisy 's hand into the crook of his elbow and said something as he led her off the floor ; and she thought for the last time of the king and the governess , their improbable pairing that led to a lasting romance ( that contradiction in terms that made her smile , that only happened in the movies ) ; and his words , which might have been praise-were surely praise-meant no more to her than the grades she wrote on her students ' papers . <p> As she went to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaining ones , said something about how important it was to keep one 's feet on the floor , when dancing , and Daisy wondered if really she had flown . <p> Then she was alone . She picked up her purse , that little beaded number she had been embarrassed to buy , because distinguished poets ca n't afford such fripperies , and went off to do something , she was not sure what ; only she knew she could not look at her beautiful friend , the vulture , in the teacher 's arms ( even while knowing that no one was in his arms , that this was not the way to describe it ) . <p> The ladies ' room . That was always the right destination . <p> She headed down the hall , swimming through the heated air . Outside the sun was shining , it was making its usual trajectory across the great western city , but inside the huge hotel daylight could not be seen except at some backstairs window where a maid stood , shaking out a rag . And so Daisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She walked into a long narrow room of mirrors , basins , soap dispensers , pale pink lights , toilets flushing behind closed doors . <p> Opening the beaded frippery , she took out her lipstick . As she rolled up the fuchsia tube , she found herself staring at it as though she did n't know whether to apply it to her forehead , her navel or her lips . <p> Behind the stall doors , two women were talking . " And that smile , " one of them said . " Who does she think she is ? " <p> " In love with him , like all the rest , " the other woman said from behind her door , and then Daisy heard them both flushing . <p> She rolled down the fuchsia tube . <p> The doors of the two stalls opened and two of her friends stepped out . <p> They stared at her , then hurried to the mirrors , speaking to her , saying the usual nice things , and then began to apply lipstick and fluff up their hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I 'm in love with dancing . " They apologized , they were terribly embarrassed ; one of them , Susie , the angry anthropologist , patted her shoulder . But Daisy had heard herself say something she did not believe-hurt pride had spurred her-but which stated in bold terms her goal . <p> It was not , as she had thought , to move from Bronze to Silver-a giant step-or to learn International Style , or to advance from the American to the Viennese Waltz . No , it was none of that . And as she slowly reapplied her lipstick-she screwed it out of its tube again while her friends were still apologizing-she heard her goal stated as clearly as the words of the dance tune . <p> Is it enough , she wondered , to hear the words ? And at the same time , her friends were accompanying her out of the bathroom ; they did not want her to be left alone with what they had said . <p> " What was that song you danced to ? " one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a beautiful song ! " the other one , the angry anthropologist , exclaimed . <p> " Shall we dance ? " Daisy asked , and it was enough , suddenly . It was all she would ever need to say . <p> Author Affiliation
