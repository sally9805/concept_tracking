<p> PUNTA ARENAS , Chile - The " " cursed clan . " <p> That 's what Charles Darwin called the indigenous people who lived in the area now known as Punta Arenas . Darwin studied these tribes in 1834 while sailing on the HMS Beagle , gathering the fossils and flora that would back his evolution theories . <p> The four aboriginal groups - Onas , Yamanas , Tehuelches and Alacalufes - must truly have seemed cursed to the British naturalist , who estimated that about 3,000 natives were living on the southern tip of South America . <p> These nomadic tribes never ventured far from the shore and its abundant food supply . Some , like the Yamanas and Alacalufes , traveled by canoe , hunting seals , walruses and other marine life . They hunted with bows and arrows , harpoons and spears . <p> Despite the harsh weather conditions , they wore little or no clothing , protecting their skin with a mixture of mud and walrus oil . <p> Although the lifestyles and languages of these tribes differed , they were similar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives were large people , and early Spanish and Portuguese explorers were particularly impressed by their feet and crude footwear . Indeed , Patagonia ( translated : Big Feet ) , which covers hundreds of mountainous islands and glacier-filled channels , is named for the people who welcomed explorers to the region . <p> In the middle of Plaza de Armas , a monument to Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan features a figure representing these natives . Locals say that if you touch the ( now shiny ) toe of the Patagonian , you will one day return to Punta Arenas . <p> Few descendants of the native Patagonians remain in Punta Arenas today . Most of the city 's 112,000 residents are descendants of the Italians , Swiss , British , Spanish and Germans who colonized the region during the turn of the century . The largest contingent of settlers came from Yugoslavia . <p> Visitors to this clean , middle-class town see no signs of the poverty often associated with Latin America . Roses star in well-tended gardens behind fences that seem more for decoration than to bar intruders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combinations appear whimsical , as if homes were painted to honor sports teams . There is red on yellow , blue on orange , green on yellow - a fun sight as seen from Lookout Hill , an easy walk from Plaza de Armas , the city 's main square . <p> Although not a particularly steep hill , it does offer a great view of the sprawling city , sandwiched between the Andes and the Strait of Magellen . <p> Punta Arenas represents the headquarters for most travelers exploring Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego , a rugged region that includes parts of Chile and Argentina . The city also is known as the " " Gateway to Antarctica . " While cruises to Antarctica and explorations of the 350-mile Strait of Magellan generally take a week or more , day trips from Punta Arenas are plentiful . Magellanic penguins nest about an hour 's drive away , while the spectacular Torres del Paine National Park is about a six-hour drive . Visitors may also spend some time exploring the Pan American Highway , which stretches 14,000 miles north to Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ends a few miles south of here . <p> But do n't be in a rush to leave Punta Arenas . Modern-day explorers uncover a rich legacy - one that includes decades as a leader of South American education , culture and commerce - amid this romantic setting . And for the most part , the city can be explored on foot . <p> A good starting point is the Mayorino Borgatello Salesian Museum , which showcases the lifestyle and crafts of the area 's four aboriginal groups , as well as the missionary work of the Salesians . <p> Attractive dioramas reveal the stories of the indigenous people . Excellent examples of native handicrafts share museum space with early weapons and clothing . <p> Another part of the museum features the area 's mounted fauna . <p> This collection , though extensive , is looking a little ragged - much of it has been around since the museum opened in 1897 . <p> Nearby and just a block off the main plaza , the Magallenes Museum actually combines two museums in one terrific house . <p> The Regional Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent Braun-Menendez family , concentrates on history beginning with Magellan 's discovery of Chile in 1520 . <p> The second aspect is the family 's preserved living quarters . <p> Designed by French architect Antoine Beaulier , who used a Croatian contractor and Italian craftsmen , this house was built between 1903 and 1906 and was declared a national monument in 1974 . <p> A visit to both provides insight into a city that was founded as a penal colony in 1848 and may never have attracted more than prisoners and whalers had it not been for the California gold rush , which also began that year . <p> Individuals on the east coast of the United States found they could get to California quickest via water . With good weather , the long trip south around Cape Horn could still take less than three months with no fears of blizzards , dust storms or uprisings . <p> Especially between 1874 and 1920 , Punta Arenas flourished . It boasted the first Chilean newspaper , its theater hosted Europe 's stars , and attractions included a popular horse track and gymnasium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . <p> Among its industries were sea wolf-hunting , coal mining , saw milling and gold mining . In 1876 , 300 sheep were introduced to Tierra del Fuego , and within 10 years the sheep population numbered 150,000 . <p> The Menendez fortune was founded on sheep ranching , and the family mansion , with its stained-glass ceilings and detailed molding , represents the boom days of Punta Arenas . <p> The golden salon is the home 's most elegant room , with silk brocade drapes , bronze and crystal lamps , and everything else dipped in gold leaf . Nearly as stunning is the billiard room , decorated in French Neo-Renaissance style with dark paneling and unique lamps . <p> Visitors also can enjoy an outdoor " " museum " at the city 's cemetery , one of the most scenic spots in Punta Arenas . <p> Century-old cypress topiaries create walls between elaborate mausoleums . Large family crypts pay homage to immigrant ancestors . A monument to the now-extinct Onas can be seen here . <p> Nearby are two interesting works of art : a monument to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of statues that pay tribute to sheep farming . <p> A casual pace and friendly atmosphere exist in Punta Arenas . <p> You 'll mark yourself as a tourist if you carry an umbrella or walk faster than a stroll . <p> Unlike their all-business cousins in Santiago , these Chileans do lunch . Most shops and businesses close at noon and reopen at 3 p.m . Businesses are generally open until 8 p.m. , and you rarely sit down for dinner before 9:30 p.m <p> For lunch , duck into the spartan El Infante , with its family-size tables , paper napkins and white-aproned waiters . <p> Try the Milanese Sausage and order it " " poor-style , " a designation given on menus here to any meat prepared with eggs and french fries . It 's a heart-clogging concoction : thin slices of roast , ham and white cheese are pressed together , breaded and fried , then topped with two fried eggs ( over easy ) and served with grilled onions and fries on the side on a giant platter . <p> For dinner , experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hotel itself could use some improvements ( or room-rate adjustment ) , but its restaurant is charming and popular . <p> A filling meal begins with a complimentary tray of cheese , ham and olives . A chicken salad appetizer is filled with pineapple and apple and served with a dollop of spicy mayonnaise . The main course is a large fried ( surprise ) chicken breast with cream gravy . The gravy is dotted with pineapple and also covers rice with peas . <p> Could it be that folks in Punta Arenas stroll because they 're weighted down by these heavy meals ? <p> The liveliest spots in town are the port , where all manner of vessels dock , and the duty-free zone , where hundreds of little shops sell perfume , electronics , toys and linens . <p> Unfortunately , the latter is not a place for the claustrophobic or for those bothered by cigarette smoke . <p> For travel information on Punta Arenas , call ( 800 ) 825-2332.
