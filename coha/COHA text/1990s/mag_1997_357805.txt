You do n't want to pay taxes to a smiling man with a name tag and a button that says WE WORK FOR YOU . You want a Grand Slam breakfast from that guy . You want to pay your taxes to a balding , bespectacled old curmudgeon , preferably overweight and incapable of making eye contact . If you 're going to get milked by the government , you want to walk away feeling completely screwed . <P> But that 's not the way it felt last Saturday when the Internal Revenue Service inaugurated its bubbly new monthly Problem Solving Day service . At 33 sites across the country , IRS auditors had their name tags and their best behavior on display as they sacrificed part of their weekend to help the taxpayers . And though it felt earnest and went over well with the people who came to be served , there may be nothing sadder than watching one of the world 's last great bureaucracies give up its well-earned reputation as a hard-ass . <P> At the Manhattan headquarters of the IRS , visitors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director Charles Baugh , who did everything he could to make them feel at home . Upstairs , IRS employees outnumbered concerned taxpayers , which necessitated still more flesh pressing . All those smiles and handshakes and salutations felt out of character . It was like having Kerri Strug as your pit boss . <P> Ever since Congress stuck it to the IRS in brutal hearings this fall , the agency has been making a concerted effort to crawl out of the 1950s . It fished in the private sector to hire a new commissioner . It took to referring to taxpayers as customers . It has even managed to serve up what may be the government 's best Website  --  the Digital Daily  --  which touts Problem Solving Day as " a new way to work with taxpayers to provide effective relief from the headache , fever , and that all-over achy feeling that accompanies long-standing tax problems . " <P> But vestiges of the pre-perestroika era remained on Saturday . Upon check-in , you were issued an index card that was either pink and read EXAM in Magic Marker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the place was crawling with agents , you were directed to wait your turn in a row of empty chairs . When your name was called , you were passed through a metal detector and ferried upstairs to an undecorated 6-by-6 cubicle . There you met the agent who would pore over dot-matrix printouts of your financial woes . <P> Most people came away happier than when they arrived . Only about half actually got their Problem Solved , but most felt they had at least been heard . In fact , the place at times took on the flavor of a giant interpersonal counseling session in which the phrase " the system " was invoked more than on any day since Abbie Hoffman died . People vented  --  largely about the IRS phone system 's automated help line , sometimes about the constitutionality of collecting taxes  --  and IRS agents listened , nodded sympathetically and jotted notes .
