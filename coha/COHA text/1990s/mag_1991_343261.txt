The negotiations must have been successful : each side thought the other guy got the better of the deal . That was the reaction among industry officials last week when U.S. and British negotiators finally completed a new transatlantic airlines accord , settling a major dispute over access to London 's Heathrow Airport and for the moment keeping poor Pan Am alive by the skin of its fuselage . <P> The battle was joined last fall when Pan Am , surviving only by auctioning off pieces of itself , agreed to sell its valuable gates and landing slots at Heathrow to United Airlines for $290 million . Ailing TWA soon followed suit , accepting a $445 million offer for its spots at Heathrow from American Airlines . British Airways , the world 's largest international carrier ( 20 million passengers last year ) took one look at the two giants setting up shop at the next terminal and squawked . Says Matthew Stainer , a London airlines analyst : " Its only U.S. competition was Pan Am and TWA . Both are good people to compete with because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that the bilateral treaty governing air travel between the two countries did not allow Pan Am and TWA to sell their Heathrow rights to another carrier . <P> As part of the deal struck last week , United and American will be allowed to go ahead with their plans . American will then control 17% of the transatlantic market . United will have 14% , while BA has only 11% . United also wins the right to fly to several European cities from London . U.S. officials agreed to restrain the two carriers at first , limiting them this year to the number of flights to London previously approved for Pan Am and TWA . In another concession , Washington will allow a second British carrier , most likely Virgin Atlantic Airways , to fly from Heathrow to the U.S. Virgin reacted to this news by slashing all its transatlantic fares 15% . For its part , Pan Am gets to stay in business , at least for now . Already in Chapter 11 proceedings , the carrier might have been grounded without the cash that will enable it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won several major concessions for ceding ground to such formidable new competition . Perhaps most important , it will be the only foreign carrier allowed to carry passengers to the U.S. without passing through its home country . In practical terms , this means that BA will have an edge on other European transatlantic carriers . BA also won fly-through rights , which means that it will be permitted to land in the U.S. , pick up other passengers and continue to South America , the Caribbean or even Asia . The profitable English giant may expand its U.S. web by taking advantage of new Department of Transportation rules that allow foreign carriers to own as much as 49% of U.S. carriers . Reportedly tops on its shopping list : troubled USAir.
