Chapter One&lt; Harry Stratton Trevelyan allowed himself few certainties in life , but during the past month he had become absolutely , positively sure of one thing . He wanted Molly Abberwick . Tonight he intended to ask her to have an affair with him . This was a major decision for Harry . But then , most decisions were major for him . The opening sentence of his latest book could have served as his personal motto : Absolute certainty is the greatest of all illusions . As a general rule he applied that principle to his work and to his personal life . A man had only one reliable defense against illusions in both arenas , and that defense was caution . Harry made it a habit to be very , very careful . Harry 's past as well as his current occupation combined to ensure that he viewed the world with what some people called a marked degree of cynicism . He preferred to call it intelligent skepticism , but the result was the same . The good news was that he rarely got conned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a lot of people thought that he was cold-blooded . That , however , did not bother Harry . By training and inclination , Harry demanded hard , solid proof in virtually every arena of his life . He had a passion for it . He preferred a logical approach to all things . Once in a while , however , his finely tuned brain seemed to skip the usual methodical steps and leaped straight to an insight so shatteringly perceptive that it sometimes scared him . Really scared him . Nevertheless , for the most part , he took satisfaction in exercising his razor-sharp intelligence . He knew that he was much better at thinking than he was at handling relationships . Thus far he had moved slowly and carefully toward his goal of beginning an affair with Molly . He did not intend to make the mistake he had made with his ex-fiance . He would not become involved with another woman in a desperate attempt to seek an answer to the dark questions about himself that he could not , would not put into words . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will that be all , Harry ? " Harry glanced at his part-time housekeeper . Ginny Rondell , a plump , pleasant-faced woman in her late forties , hovered on the other side of the long granite counter that separated the kitchen from the living room of the high-rise condominium . " Yes , thank you , Ginny , " Harry said . " An excellent meal , by the way . " Molly Abberwick , seated on the black sofa facing the wall of windows , smiled warmly at Ginny . " It was fantastic . " Ginny 's broad face suffused with pleasure . " Thank you , Ms. Abberwick . The tea is ready , Dr. Trevelyan . Are you sure you do n't want me to serve it ? " " Thanks , I 'll handle it , " Harry said . " Yes , well , I 'll say good night , then . " Ginny came around the edge of the long counter and trundled toward the green-marble-tiled hall . Harry waited with an unfamiliar sense of gathering impatience as Ginny opened a closet door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her sweater . At last she let herself out through the front door . An acute silence fell on the condominium . Alone at last , Harry thought , wryly amused at his own eagerness . He had n't felt this way in a long , long time . He could not even recall the last occasion . It had no doubt occurred at some point in his youth . He was thirty-six , but he had been feeling very ancient for the past eight years . " I 'll get the tea , " he said as he got to his feet . Molly nodded . There was an expectant look in her wide , sea green eyes . Harry hoped the expression boded well for his plans for the evening . He had turned off both phones for the night , an unheard-of course of action . Ginny had been astounded . True , he generally switched off the business line in the evenings or when he was engaged in intensive study , but he never threw the switch on the family line when he was at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feuding clans . Harry got to his feet and walked to the granite counter . He picked up the tray containing the pot of tea and two cups . He had ordered the very expensive Darjeeling after having made it his business to discover Molly 's personal preference . No sugar . No milk . Harry was good with details . Covertly , he studied Molly as he carried the tea tray to the glass table in front of the sofa . There was definitely an undercurrent of excitement stirring in her . He could almost feel it lapping at him in tiny waves . His own anticipation surged . Molly sat somewhat primly on the sofa , her attention caught by the lights of the Pike Place Market down below and the dark expanse of Elliott Bay . It was summer in the Northwest , and the days seemed to last forever . But it was after ten o'clock , and night had finally arrived . Along with it had come Harry 's opportunity to begin an affair with his client . This was not the first time Molly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He worked out of his home , and Molly had come here often enough on business during the past month . But this was the first time she had ever seen the sights at night . " You have an incredible view from up here , " she said as he set the tea tray down on the coffee table . " I like it . " Harry sat down beside her and reached for the teapot . Out of the corner of his eye he saw her smile . He took that to be another good sign . Molly had a very expressive face . Harry could have watched her for hours . The angle of her brows reminded him of a bird on the wing . The image was a good metaphor for Molly . A man who wanted to catch her would have to be very fast and very smart . Harry told himself that he was both . Tonight Molly was dressed in a businesslike , moss green pantsuit complete with a one-button jacket and softly pleated trousers . She wore a pair of demure , suede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's feet , but he found himself captivated by Molly 's . They were perfectly arched with delicate ankles . All in all , a marvel of engineering design , he thought . The rest of Molly was well designed , too . Having given the matter a great deal of close consideration in recent days , Harry had finally concluded that Molly was slender , but definitely not skinny . She practically radiated health and vitality . He was extremely healthy , himself . He had the reflexes of a cat , and he actually felt turbocharged when Molly was in the vicinity . There was an appealing roundness to certain portions of Molly 's anatomy . The jacket of the pantsuit skimmed over high breasts that Harry knew would fit nicely into his hand . The pleats of the trousers flared to encompass full , womanly hips . Although he found her figure eminently interesting , it was Molly 's vibrant face that commanded Harry 's most serious attention . She was spectacular , he thought with satisfaction . Not spectacularly beautiful , just spectacular . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green eyes . Harry acknowledged that he was a sucker for brains in a woman . There was strength and fortitude and character in the delicate yet determined lines of her nose and high cheekbones . Her honey brown hair had a mind of its own . It exploded around her head in a short , thick , frothy mass . The style emphasized the tilt of her fey eyes . It occurred to Harry that with those eyes , Molly could have made her living as a carnival fortune-teller . It would have been a simple matter for her to convince any likely mark that she could see straight into his past , present , and future . The realization sparked a flash of renewed caution in Harry . The last thing he needed was a woman who could see deeply into his soul . That way lay madness . For the space of perhaps three heartbeats he seriously questioned the wisdom of getting involved with a woman whose gaze held such a disconcerting degree of perception . He did not do well with women who were inclined to probe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved that much . On the other hand , he had no patience with bimbos . For a few seconds Harry let his future hang in the balance as he contemplated his next move . Molly gave him a questioning smile , revealing two slightly crooked front teeth . There was something endearing about those two teeth , Harry thought . He took a deep breath and consigned his qualms to hell with a breathtaking recklessness that should have alarmed him . It would be okay this time , he told himself . Molly was a businesswoman , not a psychologist . She would take , a rational , levelheaded approach to what he was about to offer . She would not be inclined to dissect him or try to analyze him . " I would like to discuss something with you . " Harry poured tea into her cup with calm deliberation . " Yes . " Molly gave a little shriek , made a small fist , and pumped it wildly . Her eyes glowed . " Hot damn , I knew it . " Harry looked up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she picked up her teacup . " It 's about time , if you do n't mind my saying so . " Enthusiasm was a good thing in a woman , Harry assured himself . " Uh , no . No , I do n't mind . I just had n't realized that we were on the same wavelength here . " " You know what they say about great minds thinking alike . " Harry smiled . " Yes . " " I realized when you invited me to dinner tonight that this was a special occasion , not an ordinary business consultation . " " Right . " " I knew that you had finally made a decision . " " I have , as a matter of fact . " He eyed her closely . " I 've given the matter a great deal of thought . " " Naturally . If I 've learned one thing about you during the past few weeks , it 's that you give everything a great deal of thought . So you finally concluded that Duncan Brockway 's grant proposal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a split second . " Brockway 's proposal ? " Molly 's eyes sparkled with satisfaction . " I knew you 'd approve that one . I just knew it . It 's so original . So intriguing . And the potential is absolutely unlimited . " Harry narrowed his eyes . " This has nothing to do with Brockway 's grant proposal . I wanted to talk about another matter . " The excitement in her eyes dimmed slightly . " You did look it over , did n't you ? " " Brockway 's proposal ? Yes , I did . It 's no good . We can go into the details later , if you like . But right now I want to discuss something more important . " Molly looked honestly baffled . " What 's more important than Duncan Brockway 's grant proposal ? " Harry set his teacup down with great precision . " Our relationship . " " Our what ? " " I think you heard me . " Molly 's cup crashed back into its saucer . " That does it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's wrong ? " " You have the nerve to ask me what 's wrong ? After telling , me that you 're not going to approve Duncan 's proposal ? " " Molly , I 'm trying to conduct an intelligent conversation here . However , it seems to be falling apart . Now , about our relationship  --  " " Our relationship ? " Molly erupted from the sofa with the force of a small volcano . " I 'll tell you about our relationship . It 's a complete , unmitigated disaster . " " I was n't aware that we even had one yet . " " We most certainly do . But it 's ending here . Now . Tonight . I refuse to continue to pay for your services as a consultant , Harry Trevelyan . Thus far , I have not received one damn thing for my money . " " There seems to be a misunderstanding here . " " I 'll say there is . " There was green sheet lightning in Molly 's eyes . " I thought you invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved Duncan Brockway 's grant proposal . " " Why in hell would I invite you to dinner just to tell you that Brockway 's proposal is a scam ? " " It 's not a scam . " " Yes , it is . " Harry was not accustomed to having his verdicts questioned . He was , after all , a leading authority in his field . " According to you , every single one of the one hundred grant proposals that have been submitted to the Abberwick Foundation have been scams . " " Not all of them . " Harry preferred accuracy to gross generalizations . " Some were just plain bad science . Look , Molly , I 'm trying to discuss something else entirely here . " " Our relationship , I believe you said . Well , it 's over , Dr. Trevelyan . This was your last chance . You 're fired . " Harry wondered if he had accidentally stepped into a parallel universe . This was not going according to plan . He had made his decision regarding Molly with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the start , but he had not allowed himself to be swept away by physical desire . He had worked from a very basic premise . Following the demise of his engagement over a year ago , he had given his future sex life a great deal of serious contemplation . He had concluded that he knew exactly what he needed in a woman . He wanted a relationship with someone who had a lot of interests of her own , someone who would not require constant attention from him . He required a woman who would not take mortal offense when he was consumed with his research . A woman who would not care if he locked himself in his office to work on a book or an investigation . A woman who could tolerate the demands of his personal life . Most of all he wanted an affair with a woman who would not question his moods or suggest that he get therapy for them . Molly Abberwick had appeared to fit the bill . She was twenty-nine years old , a competent , successful entrepreneur . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger sister single-handedly after her mother 's death several years earlier . Her father had been a genius , but as was usually the case with the obsessively creative type , he had devoted his time to his inventions , not his children . From what Harry could discern , Molly was no fragile flower , but a strong , sturdy plant that could weather the worst storms , perhaps even those that occasionally howled across his own melancholy soul . As the proprietor of the Abberwick Tea &; Spice Company , Molly had proven her ability to survive and flourish in the tough , competitive world of small business . In addition to running her shop , she was the sole trustee of the Abberwick Foundation , a charitable trust established by her father , the late Jasper Abberwick . Jasper 's inventions were the real source of the wealth in the Abberwick family . It was the business of the trust that had brought Molly to Harry a month ago . " You do n't want to fire me , " Harry said . " It 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's certainly not much point in continuing our association . Nothing is getting done . " " What , exactly , did you expect from me ? " Molly threw up her hands in exasperation . " I thought you would be more helpful . More positive . More excited about the various grant proposals . No offense , but waiting for you to approve one is like watching trees grow . " " I do n't do excited . I take a deliberate approach to my work . I thought you understood that . That 's why you hired me in the first place . " " You 're deliberate the same way a stone wall is deliberate . " Molly clasped her hands behind her back and began to pace the carpet in front of the windows with long , angry strides . " Our association has been a complete waste of time . " Harry watched her , fascinated . Molly 's whole body vibrated with outrage . The volatile emotion should have worried him , but it only seemed to add yet another intriguing dimension to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . " I knew you would probably be difficult " Molly turned her head to glower furiously at him over her shoulder . " But I did n't think you would be impossible . " Definitely riveting , Harry decided . He could not recall the last time he had been riveted by a woman . Rivet was a word he generally reserved for other areas of interest . A discussion of Leibniz 's claim to the invention of the calculus was riveting . Charles Babbage 's design for an analytical engine was riveting . The ramifications of Boole 's work in symbolic logic were riveting . Tonight Harry knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that Molly Abberwick had to be added to the list of things that could rivet him . The knowledge made him deeply uneasy even as it fed his hunger for her . " Look , I 'm sorry that you think I 'm difficult , " Harry began . " Not difficult . Impossible . " He cleared his throat . " Do n't you think that 's an overly personal way to characterize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant proposal fraudulent is an overly personal way to characterize poor Duncan . " " Forget Brockway 's proposal . I only did what you pay me to do , Molly . " " Is that right ? Then you 're overcharging me . " " No , I 'm not . You 're overreacting . " " Overreacting ? Overreacting ? " Molly reached the granite counter . She whirled around and started back toward the opposite wall . " I 'll admit that I 'm fed up . If you want to call that overreacting , fine . But it does n't change anything . This relationship of ours is not working out at all the way that I thought it would . What a disappointment . What a waste of time . " " We do n't exactly have a relationship , " Harry said through his teeth . " We have a business association . " " Not any longer , " she announced triumphantly . From out of nowhere , Harry felt the dark , brooding sensation descend on him . He should have been thanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A relationship with Molly would never have worked . But instead of a sense of relief , he knew a hint of despair . He recalled the day Molly had walked into his office-study for the first time . She had announced that she wished to hire him as a consultant for the Abberwick Foundation . The trust had been established by her father to make grants to promising inventors who could not get funding for their work . Jasper Abberwick had known the problems such people faced all too well . He and his brother , Julius , had labored under financial difficulties for most of their careers . Their cash flow problems had not been resolved until four years ago , when Jasper had succeeded in patenting a new generation of industrial robots . Jasper had not been able to enjoy his newfound wealth for long . He and his brother , Julius , had both been killed two years ago while experimenting with their latest creation , a prototype design for a man-powered aircraft . It had taken a year to get the Abberwick Foundation up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now eager to use the income to make the kind of grants her father had wanted her to make . As the foundation 's sole trustee , she was required to handle a wide variety of problems . She was adept at dealing with the vast majority of them , specifically the ones that involved financial decisions . But , unlike her father , she was a businesswoman , not an engineer or a scientist . Evaluating the merits of the grant proposals submitted by desperate inventors required a sound , working knowledge of scientific principles and cutting-edge technology . In addition , it demanded historical perspective . Such judgments could only be rendered by a trained mind . The Abberwick Foundation had required the services of someone who could judge a proposal not on the basis of its potential for immediate industrial application , but for its long-term value . Beyond that , Molly had also needed someone who could weed out the frauds and con artists who circled wealthy foundations such as hers like so many sharks in the water . Molly had many impressive credentials , Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background . She was a woman with half a million dollars a year to spend , and she needed help . Specifically she needed Harry Stratton Trevelyan , Ph.D . Thus far Harry had perused over a hundred grant proposals for her . He had not approved a single one . He was chagrined to realize that he had not understood how impatient Molly had become during the past few weeks . His attention had obviously been focused on other things . He had been curious about her from the moment she had made the appointment to interview him as a consultant . He had recognized her last name immediately . The Abberwick family had produced a long string of eccentric but undeniably gifted inventors over the years . The Abberwick name was not exactly a household word , but it was certainly a familiar one in the commercial world . There it was associated with a variety of machine tools , control system components , and , in recent years , robotic devices . As an authority in the esoteric field of the history and philosophy of science , Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions to technology . The family had a history as old as the nation itself . One early colonial Abberwick had made a significant improvement to printing press machinery . That particular device had made it possible to double the output of certain inflammatory tracts and newspapers , which had , in turn , helped shape public opinion concerning a revolution in the American colonies . In the 1870s another Abberwick had made a major advance in steam engine design . The result had been increased efficiency for the railroads , which had , in turn , influenced the development of the western regions of the United States . In the late 1930s an Abberwick had invented a control mechanism that had made assembly lines more efficient . The increased efficiency had impacted wartime production of tanks and airplanes . And so it went . The Abberwick name was sprinkled about the history of American invention like so much popcorn on the floor of a theater . And it was noticed in much the same manner . One did n't really see it until one stepped on it . But Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information . Invention shaped history , and history shaped invention . Harry frequently studied the way in which the two meshed , mingled , and influenced each other . He gave lectures on the subject at various universities and colleges . He wrote books that were considered classics in the field of the history of science . And somewhere along the way , he had become an authority on scientific fraud . Harry frowned as he watched Molly fume . It alarmed him that he was still looking for an excuse to pursue an affair with her . An intelligent man would back off at this point , and he was nothing if not intelligent . " Let 's be realistic , here , Molly , " he said . " Firing me would be an extremely foolish move on your part . We both know that . " She spun around , brows beetled . " Do n't you dare call me a fool . " " I did n't call you a fool . I merely said that it would be foolish to end our business arrangement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have serious doubts about that . " She aimed a finger at him . " You 're supposed to advise me , but so far all of your decisions can be summed up in a single word . And that word is no . " " Molly ... " " It does n't take any great talent to say no , Dr. Trevelyan . I 'll bet that I can find lots of people who can say it . Some of them probably charge a good deal less than you do , too . " " But will they say yes when they should say it ? " he asked softly . " All right , so maybe another consultant will screw up now and then , and I 'll make some grants to the wrong people . " She dismissed that possibility with a wave of her hand . " You know what the French say , you ca n't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs . At least something will get done . " " Half a million dollars a year is more than a few eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic specialist here in Seattle who possesses the historical perspective as well as the scientific and engineering expertise to advise you . " She looked down her strong , assertive little nose at him . " I do n't see why it should be so difficult to find someone else to do this kind of consulting . " Harry realized with a sense of amazement that he was actually getting angry . He quickly suppressed the sensation . He would not allow Molly to set a match to his temper . " You 're welcome to try , of course , " he said politely . Molly 's soft mouth tightened . She tapped the toe of one suede pump and regarded him with an expression of simmering irritation . Harry said nothing . They both knew that her odds of finding anyone else with his peculiar combination of qualifications was bleak . " Damn , " Molly said eventually . Harry sensed a minor victory . " You 're going to have to be patient , Molly . " " Says who ? I 'm the sole trustee of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " This argument is degenerating  --  " " Yes , it is , is n't it ? " Molly brightened . " And you know what ? It feels good . I 've been wanting to say a few things to you for days , Dr. Trevelyan . " " Harry will do . " She smiled grimly . " Oh , no , I would n't dream of calling you just plain Harry . Harry does n't suit you at all , Dr. Harry Stratton Trevelyan , Ph.D. , author , lecturer , and noted detector of scientific fraud . " She threw out a hand to indicate the three copies of his latest book that sat on a nearby shelf . " You 're much too pompous and arrogant to be a mere Harry . " Harry became aware of a faint , unfamiliar staccato sound . He looked down and discovered that he was drumming his finger against the arm of the sofa . With an effort of will he made himself stop . He was an idiot even to contemplate trying to salvage his tenuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . But the thought of never seeing her again suddenly conjured up an image of a glass bridge stretched over an abyss . It was an old and terrifying mental picture . He pushed it back into the shadows with every ounce of will at his command . " Why do n't you sit down , Molly ? " he said , determined to regain control of the situation . " You 're a businesswoman . Let 's discuss this in a businesslike manner . " " There 's nothing to discuss . You said no to Duncan Brockway 's grant proposal , remember ? And your opinion seems to be the only one that counts around here . " " I vetoed this particular funding request because it 's clearly a scam . It 's an obvious attempt to defraud the Abberwick Foundation of twenty thousand , dollars . " Molly folded her arms beneath her breasts and regarded him with belligerent challenge . " You really believe that ? " " Yes . " " You 're certain ? " " Yes . " " Positive ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It must be nice to be so sure of yourself . " Harry did not respond to that goad . Silence fell . " I really liked Duncan 's proposal , " Molly said finally . " I know . " She flashed him a quick , searching look , as if sensing weakness . " There 's no hope at all ? " " None . " " Not even a shred of a possibility that Brockway has hit upon a fundamentally new concept ? " " No . I can run the proposal past a friend of mine at the University of Washington who is an expert on energy sources , if you want confirmation . But he 'll back me up . There is no valid scientific basis for Brockway 's concept of generating power from moonlight in any manner that is even remotely analogous to the collection of solar power . The technology he proposes to use does not exist , and the theory behind the whole project is pure bull . " Amusement briefly replaced the anger in Molly 's eyes . " Pure bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , as a matter of fact , it is . " Harry was thrown off-balance by her sudden shift of mood . " Very useful jargon . It can be applied to any number of situations . Save the foundation 's money for a more deserving applicant , Molly . This Duncan Brockway character is trying to take you for twenty grand . " Molly gave a resigned-sounding groan and threw herself back down onto the sofa . " Okay , I surrender . Sorry I lost my temper . But I 'm really getting frustrated , Harry . I 've got a lot of things to do . I ca n't spend all of my time trying to get grant proposals past you  --  " The storm was past . Harry did not know whether or not to breathe a sigh of relief . " Being a trustee of a foundation is time-consuming . " " Brockway 's plan seemed like such a brilliant idea , " Molly said wistfully . " Just think , a battery that can generate power from moonlight . " " Con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of audacity . " Harry eyed her with sudden speculation . " And charm . " Molly winced . " All right , so I liked Duncan Brockway . He seemed very earnest and sincere when I interviewed him . " " I do n't doubt that . " So the bastard had tried to sweet-talk her into giving him the money , Harry thought . It came as no surprise . Nevertheless , it annoyed him . " Brockway was very earnestly and sincerely trying to get twenty thousand dollars from the Abberwick Foundation . " Molly scowled . " That 's not fair . Duncan 's an inventor , not a con man . Just a dreamer who wanted to make his dreams come true . I come from a long line of such people . The Abberwick Foundation exists to help them . " " You told me that the mandate of the foundation is to fund serious inventors who ca n't get government or corporate backing for their projects . " " I believe that Duncan Brockway is serious . " Molly lifted one shoulder in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were somewhat overenthusiastic . That 's not unusual in an inventor . " " And he seemed like such a nice man , " Harry muttered . " Well , he did . " " Molly , if there 's one thing I know , it 's con artists . You hired me to weed them out for you , remember ? " " I hired you to help me select the best grant proposals and to choose funding applicants who present innovative concepts . " " And to ferret out the scams . " " Okay , okay . You win . Again . " " This is n't supposed to be a battle , " Harry said wearily . " I 'm just trying to do my job . " " Sure . " " I know that the foundation money is burning a hole in your pocket , but there will be plenty of opportunities to give it away . " " I 'm beginning to wonder about that . " " You do n't want to be too hasty . Selecting legitimate applicants takes time . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way a man should select a lover , Harry thought . " Uh-huh . " Molly glanced at the crammed bookcases that covered two walls of the large living room . " How long have you been doing this kind of consulting ? " " Officially ? About six years . " Harry frowned at the sudden change of topic . " Why ? " " Just curious . " She gave him a sublimely innocent smile . " You 've got to admit it 's an unusual career . There are n't a lot of people who specialize in detecting fraudulent grant applications . How did you get started ? " Harry wondered where this was going . The woman changed directions faster than alternating current . " A few years ago an acquaintance who was overseeing a government-funded project became suspicious of some of the test results . He asked me if I would take a look at the methodology the grant recipient claimed to be using . I did . It was immediately clear that the outcome of the experiments had been rigged . " " Immediately clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You realized the guy was a fake right away ? " " Yes . " " Just like that ? " She snapped her fingers . Harry did not want to go into a detailed explanation of just how it had become evident to him that an elaborate fraud had been perpetrated . Let 's just say I have a feel for that kind of thing . " " A feel for it ? " Molly sat forward , obviously intrigued . " You mean you 're psychic or something ? " " Hell , no , I 'm not psychic . " Harry grabbed the teapot and forced himself to pour more of the Darjeeling into his cup . He was pleased to see that not so much as a single drop splashed on the glass table . His hands were as steady as ever . " That 's a crazy thing to suggest . Do I look like the kind of person who would claim psychic powers ? " Molly settled back against the sofa .

" Harry ground his teeth . " My background gives me insights which those who have specialized in only a single field tend to miss . " " Ah , yes . Insights . " " Exactly . As I was saying  --  " " Before you were so rudely interrupted , " she murmured . " To answer your question concerning my career path , " Harry plowed on steadily , " one consulting job led to another . I now do a handful every year , provided that they do n't get in the way of my research and writing projects . " " Your research and writing are more important to you ? " " Absolutely . " Molly propped one elbow on the arm of the sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So how come you agreed to work for me ? I 'm sure I 'm not paying you nearly as much as you can get from a contract with the government or a big corporation . " " No , " he agreed . " You are n't . " " Why , then , are you bothering to consult for the lowly little Abberwick Foundation ? " " Because you 're willing to do what government and industry wo n't do . " She tilted her head to one side . " What 's that ? " " Waste money on interesting , intriguing projects that do n't have any immediate , obvious application . You 're willing to invest in the unknown . " Her brows raised . " That 's why you agreed to work for me ? " " That 's why I agreed to consult for you , " he corrected coolly . " Same thing . " " Not quite . " She ignored that . " Why are you so eager to fund a bunch of crazy inventors ?

" I wo n't pretend it was the hottest bedside reading that I 've ever done , but I admit that I found it unexpectedly interesting . " Harry was amazed to discover that he felt flattered . He glanced at the book on the nearby shelf . Illusions of Certainty : Toward a New Philosophy of Science was not the sort of volume that made best-seller lists . A lengthy , meticulously researched discussion of historical and societal constraints on scientific and technological progress , it was aimed squarely at the academic market . It had sold very well as a college text for students in the history of science , but it had not been meant for the average reader . Of course , Molly Abberwick was hardly average , he thought ruefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Swindles , and Hoaxes was much more popular , " Harry said , striving for modesty . Calculated Deceptions had been his first stab at writing for the lay market . It had done surprisingly well . " I read that one , too . " " I see . " Harry got to his feet , embarrassed . He went to stand at the window . " Well . Thank you . " " Do n't thank me . I was doing research on you . " " Research ? " " I was trying to decide whether or not to hire you as my fraud detective . " Harry winced . He gazed out into the night and tried to reassemble his fragmented bits of logic . So Molly was not quite what he had expected . So there were some unplumbed depths in her . Some surprises . So what ? He was thirty-six years old , but his Trevelyan reflexes were still very good . He could handle an affair with Molly , he decided . " Go on , " she prompted . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're taken with the idea of funding inventions that do n't offer any obvious payback . " Harry contemplated the night on the other side of the wall of windows . " I told you , I 've made a career of studying the history of invention and discovery . In the course of that study I often find myself asking certain questions . " " What kind of questions ? " " Questions such as what would have happened if Charles Babbage had gotten funding to build his analytical engine in 1833 , for example . " " The history of the computer would have to be rewritten ? " Molly suggested . " Undoubtedly . If he had been able to create his vision , the world might have headed into the computer age a hundred years earlier . Just think how much farther along we 'd be by now . " Harry turned away from the window , suddenly caught up in the passion he felt for his subject . " There are a thousand other examples of brilliant concepts that languished for lack of money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the front door opened . " What in the world ? " Molly glanced toward the glass-block barrier that divided the front hall from the living area . " I think someone 's coming in , Harry . " Harry started forward . " Ginny must have forgotten to lock the door on her way out . " The intruder suddenly appeared . He was a tall , lanky young man dressed in jeans and a blue workshirt . He stopped when he saw Harry , braced his feet apart , and raised his arm . Light gleamed on the steel blade in his right hand . " This is the end , Trevelyan , " the newcomer snarled . " I 've finally tracked you down . You wo n't escape this time . " " My God . " Molly leaped off the sofa . " He 's got a knife . " " So he does . " Harry paused . The intruder drew back his hand with a lethal , practiced movement . " Look out . " Molly grabbed the teapot . " Hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of timing . " The intruder hurled the blade . Molly shrieked and threw the teapot in the general direction of the glass blocks . First things first , Harry thought . He grabbed the teapot as it went sailing past . " Do something , " Molly yelled . Harry smiled wryly . He cradled the teapot in one hand and opened his other hand to show her the knife he held . Molly stared at him , open-mouthed . Her gaze went from the knife to the intruder 's empty hands . " You snatched that knife right out of thin air , " Molly whispered . Harry glanced down at the gleaming blade . " Looks that way , does n't it ? "
