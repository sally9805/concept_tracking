<p> When patients check out of an Evanston ( Ill . ) Northwestern Healthcare hospital , they get something special with the bill : Each receipt notes that the patient has stayed at a " Top 100 Hospital . " <p> With the release today of 1999 's Top 100 Hospital list sponsored by Baltimore-based health data firm HCIA and cable 's Health Channel , health-care facilities across the nation can join Evanston in touting themselves as the best places to go when you 're sick or injured . <p> " The HCIA rankings are both a clinical and hard financial measure of success , " Evanston chief Mark Neaman says . <p> And if your hospital did n't make today 's report , there 's always hope it will end up on competing rankings put out by newsmagazine U.S. News &; World Report in July . <p> The ratings phenomenon , whether the rankings are for colleges or hospitals , is going strong in the USA , driven by ever-more-active demands by consumers for information . But despite the acclaim paid to winners , health experts caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Critics say the criteria important to everyday folks might not be the same as those used by the raters . <p> " It does n't mean much to you or me , " says cardiologist Harlan Krumholz of the Yale School of Medicine , who has published analyses of the HCIA listings . He says individual cases vary too much for ratings to affect patient decisions . <p> HCIA generates its list by looking at the more than 3,200 hospitals that receive Medicare payments . <p> Researchers use federal data to look at hospital mortality , complications and costs , determining " who delivers good quality care in the most efficient manner , " says head analyst Jean Chenoweth of HCIA . <p> Dividing hospitals into categories by size , her organization awards benchmark status to those that outdo their peers in areas such as shortening patient stays and adherence to national standards for care . Hospitals are not ranked individually , but are designated as members of the Top 100 . <p> Krumholz complains that HCIA focuses too intensely on the bottom line , rewarding hospitals that cut costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published this year in the journal Health Affairs analyzed the HCIA Top 100 list of cardiology facilities and found that patients fared no better at the listed facilities than at other heart centers . Only their insurance companies got off easier with a stay at a listed hospital , he says , because of lower costs . <p> But HCIA says that in an era of increasing costs paid directly by patients , knowing which hospitals operate efficiently is important for consumers . <p> " We think the Top 100 hospitals are treating sicker patients , yet achieving better outcomes at a lower cost , because these are the facilities that have made quality a top priority in all areas , " Chenoweth says . Among other findings HCIA lists in this year 's report : <p> * Adjusted for illness severity , benchmark hospitals have 14% fewer patient deaths and stays that are 12% shorter compared with their peers . <p> * Total occupancy rates are almost 12% higher at benchmark hospitals . <p> * Hospitals in Southern states , 44 in total , lead the list . <p> Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. News Top 100 lists : Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston . Jeff Otten , who heads the medical system the hospital belongs to , says reliance on a systemwide computer system for handling all prescriptions and medical records has " reduced dramatically our numbers of medical errors . " <p> Overall , medical industry groups take a mixed stance toward ratings . <p> " Take each list with a grain of salt , " says Larry Gage , head of the National Association of Public Hospitals . " Between 10 and 12 " of the roughly 100 members of his group , mostly large urban hospitals , make one of the lists each year . Patients should look for " centers of excellence " in a hospital , Gage says . " Plainly , a spinal-care unit matters more to someone with back pain ( than ) a good hospital rating . " <p> " My personal view is that the more consumer information there is available about hospitals , the better off we all are , " says Thomas Scully , head of the Federation of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. News rankings , saying they 're " not based on substance , but opinion . " <p> In fact , U.S. News bases its rankings of 6,299 hospitals nationwide on surveys of medical specialists , as well as data from the American Hospital Association and mortality numbers from the Sachs Group of Evanston , Ill. , a health data firm . <p> " Frankly , I do n't put much weight in any of these ratings , " says Charles Inlander of the People 's Medical Society , a consumer group based in Allentown , Pa . <p> He criticizes hospitals for not freely divulging data on complication rates , noting recent reports that found medical mistakes to be a leading cause of death in the USA . <p> Top hospital rankings represent only the tip of the iceberg in a decade-old trend toward more quality-consciousness among hospitals , Krumholz says . " There really exists an upward spiral of knowledge about quality care , and that 's the real news about efforts to rate hospitals .
