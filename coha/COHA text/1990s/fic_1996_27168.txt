Jake Cantrell slowed his pickup truck as he approached Lake Waramaug near the Boulders Inn , braked to a standstill , and gazed out the widow . The lake was still , calm with a glassy sheen that looked almost silver in the late afternoon light of this cool April day . He lifted his eyes to the etiolated sky , so bleached out it , too , seemed as pale and as unmoving as the water . In stark contrast were the rolling hills rising up around the lake , darkly green and lush with trees . Jake could not help thinking yet again how beautiful the view was from this angle of vision , a dreamy landscape of water and sky . To Jake , it was somehow evocative , remined him of another place , yet he was not sure of where ... someplace somewhere he had never been , except in his imagination perhaps ... England , France , Italy , or Germany , maybe even Africa . Someplace he would like to go one day . If he ever got the chance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exotic lands , but thus far is his twenty-eight years of life on this planet he had only been to New York City a few times , and twice to Atlanta where his sister Patty was not living . Shading his eyes with one hand , Jake scanned the vistas of land , water , and sky once more , then nodded to himself . How incredible the light is today , almost otherwordly , he thought , as he continued to stare ahead . He had always been fascinated by light , both natural and artificial . The latter he worked with on a daily basis , the former he frequently endeavored to capture on canvas , when he had time to pick up a paintbrush and indulge himself . He loved to paint whenever he could , even though he was n't very good at it . It gave him a great sense of satisfaction , just as did creating special lighting effects . He was working on a big lighting job now , one that was tough , tested his talent and imagination , and fired his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him honked him forward , and , rousing himself from his thoughts , he pushed his boot down on the accelerator and drove on . Jake headed along Route 45 North , which would take him up to Route 341 and all the way to Kent . And as he drove he kept noticing the unusual clarity of the light today ; it echoed the light over the lake and seemed to get even brighter the farther north he drove . Lately he had come to realize that this clear bright light was endemic to this part of the state , called the northwestern highlands by some , the Litchfield Hills by others . He did not care what people called the area . All he knew was that it was beautiful , so breathtaking he thought of it as God 's own country . And the extraordinary , incandescent skies , which were almost uncanny at times , very frequently inspired awe in him . This particular area was relatively new to him , even though he had been born in Hartford , had grown up there , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four and a half years he had been a resident of New Milford , but he had rarely , if ever , ventured beyond the town 's boundaries . That is until a year ago , just after he had finally separated from his wife , Amy . He had stayed on in New Milford , living alone in a small studio on Bank Street for almost a year . It was around then that he had started driving into the countryside , going farther afield , looking for a new place to live , something a bit better than the studio , an apartment or , preferably , a small house . It was on Route 341 , near Kent , that he found the little white clapboard three months ago . It had taken him a few weeks to get it cleaned up , painted , and made reasonably habitable , then he had scoured the local junk shops and tag sales looking for furniture . He was surprised at the things he managed to find , and at the prices , which he considered reasonable . In no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapboard fresh looking and comfortable . His final purchases were a brand new bed , a good rug , a television set , all bought in one of the big stores in Danbury . He had finally moved in three weeks ago and had felt like a king in his castle ever since . Jake drove on at steady speed , not thinking about anything in particular except getting home . Home . He found himself contemplating that word all of a sudden . It hovered there in this mind . " Home , " he said out loud . And yes , he was going home . Home to his house . He savored this thought , liking it . A smile lingered on his sensitive mouth . Home . Home . Home . The word suddenly had a very special meaning to him . It signified so much . It struck him then that never in nine years of marriage to Amy had he ever called their various apartments home ; usually , whenever he referred to them , he would say our place , or back at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that until today the word home had always meant the house in Hartford where he had been raised by his parents , John and Annie Cantrell , both dead for several years . But the little white clapboard on Route 341 , with its picket fence and neat garden , was indeed home , and it had become his have , his place of refuge . There were several adjoining fields with a large barn standing in one of them , and this he had turned into a workshop and studio . Currently , he was renting the property , but he liked it so much he was seriously thinking of buying it . If he could ge a mortgage from the bank in New Milford . If the owner would sell . Jake was n't sure about either possibility at this moment . He could only hope . Apart from being the right size , the house was close enough to Northville , where he had moved his electrical business a few weeks ago . He had wanted to be out of New Milford altogether because Amy still lived and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; in fact , they were quite good friends in spite of their breakup . Their separation had been reasonably amicable , although initially she had not wanted to let him go . Eventually she had agreed . What option did she have ? He had been long gone from her emotionally and physically , even when they still shared the same apartment in New Milford . The day he had finally packed his bags and made his intentions clear for the last time , she had exclaimed , " Okey , Jake , I agree to a separation . But let 's stay friends . Please . " Long absent in spirit , and with one foot already out the door , he had willingly agreed . What harm could it do ? And anyway if it mollified her to a certain extent so much the better . Anything to make his escape easier , to get away from her at long last , in a peaceful way and without another row . Jake 's thoughts centered entirely on Amy for a moment or two , In many ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad person . Just dull , unimaginative , and something of a killjoy . Over the years she had become an albatross around his neck , dragging him down , and inducing in him an unfamiliar state of depresion . He knew that he was smart and quick and clever . He always had been , even as a child . And he was good at his job . His former boss at Bolton Electric had constantly told him he was a genius with lighting and special effects . And because of his drive , hard work , and talent he had moved up in life ; he had wanted to move even farther , but she had held him back .
