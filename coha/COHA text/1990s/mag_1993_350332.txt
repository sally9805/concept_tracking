THE TEEN COMMANDments , as revealed in Bat Out of Hell II : <P> 1 ) We 'll never be as young as we are right now . <P> 2 ) You ca n't run away forever , but there 's nothing wrong with getting a good head start . <P> 3 ) What about your school ? It 's defective ! It 's a pack of useless lies . <P> 4 ) Come on , come on , and there 'll be no turning back . You were only killing time , and it 'll kill you right back . <P> 5 ) You got ta learn to dance before you learn to crawl . <P> 6 ) Do n't worry ' bout the future  --  sooner or later it 's the past . <P> 7 ) If the thrill is gone , then it 's time to take it back . <P> 8 ) No one said it had to be real , but it 's got ta be something you can reach out and feel . <P> 9 ) And when you really , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - roll dreams do come through for you . <P> 10 ) Goddammit , Daddy ! You know I love you . But you got a hell of a lot to learn about rock ' n ' roll . <P> The passions in these psalms are familiar : anguish , anomie fueling rage , solitude seeking fusion , a gonadal pulse that just wo n't quit . Ah yes , the soul of rock in its giddy , roiling infancy . The singing voice is familiar too . That pure tenor  --  its piercing power and excellent elocution suggesting a glee-club star who 's just been kneed by the school football coach  --  could belong only to Marvin Lee Aday , known to the world as Meat Loaf . First as Eddie the zombie biker in The Rocky Horror Picture Show ( 1975 ) , then as star of writer-arranger Jim Steinman 's ambitious album Bat Out of Hell ( 1977 ) , Meat Loaf gave clarion clout to rock 's first decadent period . The Bat LP sold oodles ; one cut ( Two Out of Three Ai n't Bad ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dashboard Light ) became an influential proto-video . And for a moment or two , Meat Loaf was a movie star . <P> His 15 minutes were soon up ; by the end of the ' 80s , M. Loaf was coaching kids ' baseball in Connecticut . Meanwhile , Steinman worked on several off- Broadway musicals and created some wondrously pretentious , infectious numbers for Bonnie Tyler ( Total Eclipse of the Heart ) and the film Streets of Fire . If the Druids had needed jingles for their oak-grove revelries , Steinman would have been the man to write them . But his songs needed Meat Loaf 's urgency to lift their rude majesty to Ouch over High C. So the old colleagues reunited for Bat Out of Hell II : Back into Hell . . . It earned the obligatory pan from Rolling Stone ( " low-octane operatic drivel " ) and seemed as likely to hit America 's Top 40 as the piano stylings of Richard Klayderman . <P> It turns out that the savants had a lot to learn about retrograde , reprobate rock ' n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pop zeitgeist to occupy the No. 1 slot on Billboard 's album chart , above Nirvana and the other pricey rockers half Meat Loaf 's age ( 46 ) . Somebody in the U.S. must like this stuff , someone who remembers what rock once did  --  and still could  --  sound and feel like . Three , maybe four chords ; an amoral homily twisted into a catchphrase ; adolescent yearning and ecstasy so confused that they become harmony .
