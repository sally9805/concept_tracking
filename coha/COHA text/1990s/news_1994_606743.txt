<p> It is known as the Pearson case , a lawsuit that brought the District 's public housing department to its knees and stung Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly when a judge seized control of the ineffectual agency . <p> But Catherine Delores Pearson , et al . v. Sharon Pratt Kelly , et al . has brought nothing to Pearson herself . <p> Nearly three years after applying for public housing , Pearson has reached only No. 774 on the waiting list for efficiencies , a dire position for a woman whose life has been an odyssey of evictions , homelessness and chronic illness . <p> Pearson 's predicament underscores the frustrations of thousands of other poor District residents who have been waiting endlessly , not to say anxiously , to be placed in public housing despite years of litigation and promises by city officials to speed up the process . <p> The 46-year-old divorcee also is emblematic of the suffering that many applicants have endured while hoping that a housing unit soon becomes available . <p> A month ago , Pearson was again thrust onto the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she fell behind on the $ 90-a-week rent . <p> Such jolts have been made more severe by her health problems , which have included breast cancer , a blood clotting disorder , asthma and hypertension . Her life also has been ravaged by addictions to drugs and alcohol . <p> For the most part , Pearson , who is the mother of two grown children , wo n't stay with relatives for long periods because of the strain that it brings to their relationships . Since last week , she has been sleeping at her brother 's home . <p> Sitting in a park in the Mount Vernon section of Northwest Washington on a recent morning  --  with a garbage bag full of soiled clothes , as well as some canned sardines , pork and beans and bottles of punch  --  Pearson said she feels abandoned by a system that was designed to assist people like her . <p> " They should have helped me and given me public housing when I was sick with the cancer , " Pearson said , while shoveling handfuls of Fruity Pebbles cereal into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was removed after a malignant tumor was discovered . She said she underwent chemotherapy for six months after surgery , until doctors concluded that the cancer was in remission . <p> During that period , according to a deposition Pearson gave two years ago in connection with the suit , she lived in a cramped room in the 1800 block of Wiltberger Street NW that cost her $ 65 a week . The rent took too much of her public assistance checks , about $ 260 a month , leaving her unable to pay for prescriptions , even though they cost only 50 cents each because she was covered by Medicaid . <p> " I have enough to worry about with my health . I do n't want to worry every morning about getting evicted from somewhere or about people not wanting me around , " she said . <p> During the interview , a finger that she had cut earlier in the morning bled steadily for two hours into a piece of newspaper that she had wrapped around it . <p> Pearson 's gaunt figure was clad in a stained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , floppy tennis hat sat on her head , which was wrapped in a bandanna . She wore two watches on her left wrist . Neither worked . <p> Pearson 's name is on the suit as a matter of chance . Housing advocates chose her case from among others involving the public housing waiting list . She is one of 10,047 applicants , both individuals and families , who are on the waiting list . There are enough applicants on the waiting list to fill 85 percent of the 11,796 public housing units in the city today , and about 20 percent of those dwellings are vacant and in need of substantial repairs . <p> City documents obtained by the Washington Post under the D.C. Freedom of Information Act show that many of the applicants have been on the list from five to 10 years but have almost no chance of getting housing any time soon . <p> One woman has been waiting for a three-bedroom unit since Nov. 3 , 1978 , according to the records . <p> Nearly 80 percent of the applicants are African American women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The records show that about one-fifth of those on the waiting list work , making an average of $ 7,066 a year . Nearly half of the applicants , unemployed , receive monthly public assistance checks . <p> Housing advocates contend that the size of the waiting list illustrates the magnitude of the housing crisis facing the poor in the District and highlights the need for the city to encourage more affordable-housing options . <p> " Even if there was a 1 percent vacancy rate at the agency , there would still be thousands of households in need of housing , " said Patricia Mullahy Fugere , executive director of the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless . Her organization was involved in the Pearson v. Kelly lawsuit , filed two years ago on behalf of people on the waiting list . <p> The suit , which alleged that the housing department 's high vacancy rate and slow pace of reletting units violated federal law , lead a D.C. Superior Court judge last month to order Kelly to relinquish control of the Department of Public and Assisted Housing to a receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are an estimated 30,000 residents living in 60 public housing developments and 317 other sites scattered throughout the District . <p> The waiting list also raises questions about whether the District 's system for deciding who gets public housing shuts out applicants who try hardest to improve their lives . <p> District residents in any of several preference categories , such as being homeless or paying more than half of their income for rent , are given priority over applicants who are better off . <p> In a recent interview , the acting housing director , Jasper F. Burnette , conceded that the criteria may be skewed . " The regular average Joe who makes a less-than-average income ... and is living by the rules ... is getting passed over , " Burnette said . " Everybody wants a priority ; it is very difficult . " <p> In any case , there are no guarantees . Pearson has been in a preference category : those who put more than 50 percent of their income toward rent . Burnette said the best that the housing department can do to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair and lease the more than 2,000 dwellings that are vacant . <p> In January 1992 , when Pearson first applied for public housing , there were about 11,400 households on the list . Since then , 2,167 of them have been placed in units , officials said , but others have joined the list . <p> Overall , 15,409 households are on waiting lists for public housing or for dwellings subsidized under the federal Section 8 program or the city 's Tenant Assistance Program , city records show . Some are on more than one list . <p> Pearson signed up for the public housing waiting list after the three-bedroom house that she had shared with her husband for about 11 years in the unit block of Bates Street NW was repossessed after the couple 's separation . Pearson was unemployed and could not meet the mortgage payments once her husband , a bricklayer , moved out . <p> Since then , she has been on a downward spiral . <p> She has been evicted from two rooming houses , slept in shelters , on the streets and in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last seven years , Pearson has been arrested a total of six times for armed robbery , assault with a dangerous or deadly weapon , domestic assault and destruction of property . All the charges have been dropped or dismissed . <p> Pearson , who graduated from high school , said that most of her days are spent praying , visiting acquaintances and cleaning up garbage wherever she may be . At one point during the interview , she began to furiously pick up trash around the park . <p> " I do n't do very much . I do n't like it very much , " Pearson said . " I do n't want to be idle because an idle mind is not good ; it makes you lose confidence and control in life . " <p> Drugs are also a part of her day . <p> " In the afternoon I might roll me a joint with a little crack on it , " she said , adding that she has stopped drinking and receives weekly counseling for substance abuse . <p> Pearson said that even though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in God will enable her to turn her life around one day . One of the things she is looking forward to most of all is having a place of her own , even if it is in public housing . <p> " I miss the security of having things that are mine and having my own rules and regulations and not having to say , ' Can I sleep on your bed or on your spot ? ' " Pearson lamented . " God bless the child who has his own . " <p> Staff writer Paul Duggan contributed to this report .
