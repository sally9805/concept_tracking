Section : VETS ON PETS <p> Give your pet ( and your vet ) a break this Christmas season by taking simple precautions to prevent holiday-related injuries . <p> Playful puppies romping in the snow with bundled-up children , wide-eyed kittens mesmerized by flashing Christmas lights  --  these are the happy images we conjure up when we associate our pets with the holidays . But beware ! Behind many of our cherished yuletide traditions lurk potential disasters . <p> Every Christmas season , veterinarians treat numerous pets for serious conditions directly related to holiday celebrations . In my practice alone , I see dozens of these cases each year . Awareness of the following common holiday hazards , and appropriate precautions , can help you prevent tragedy in this season of joy . Toxicities <p> Several years ago during the week preceding Christmas , a woman presented the limp body of a young kitten to my office . She reported the kitten had been healthy until that morning , when she found it unconscious in her living room . At that point , she rushed her pet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I performed a necropsy and found mistletoe leaves and berries in the stomach . <p> Poinsettias , holly , and mistletoe are beautiful but poisonous decorative plants . Mistletoe and holly , in particular , are often deadly if ingested by curious pets . Keeping pets away from these plants is imperative , and substituting artificials may be the safest solution . <p> Decorative plants are not the only seasonal poisoning culprits . Anti-freeze dripping from car radiators has a sweet taste that attracts pets . Animals that lick up the solution often suffer permanent kidney damage before symptoms appear . As little as one tablespoonful can be lethal to a 20-pound dog . Immediate cleanup of spilled antifreeze is a must . <p> Human medications inadvertently left out by house guests are another common source of holiday toxicities . Dogs often chew through plastic childproof containers , and guests should be advised to keep their prescriptions where pets ca n't get at them . Burns <p> Lighted candles , hot electrical decorations , open fireplace screens , and bubbling fondue pots make up part of the holiday scene in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in romping household pets . Veterinarians see burn cases ranging from lethal scalds to minor singeing of foot pads . When pets are in the house , you must consider every possible scenario for contact with fire and heat . I treated a severely burned cat several Christmases ago after it jumped into a fireplace to escape pursuit by another family pet . Electrical Shock <p> Working late at my clinic on a December evening about ten years ago , I was startled to see a man stumble through the door carrying a limp bundle of white fur . I immediately pulled him into an exam room . " What have we got ? " I asked , as I began examining his unconscious pet . <p> He told me he had found his three-month-old samoyed puppy comatose under the Christmas tree . " He was just fine when I left to go shopping , Doc , and when I got back , he was just laying there completely out of it . " <p> A quick exam confirmed my suspicions . Small burn marks were visible on the muzzle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric cord . I began an IV drip and administered dexamethasone and antibiotics . <p> The puppy eventually recovered from the electrical shock , but it required a prolonged course of antibiotics to conquer a secondary pneumonia resulting from electrical current tracking into the lungs . <p> The potential for electrical shock in pets is greatly increased during the holidays due to the numerous electric cords used for lighted decorations . Cords should be hidden where possible , or guarded with pet-proof conduit to prevent tragedy . Ingested Foreign Bodies <p> Another of my clients was sitting in her living room watching a Christmas special on television when she noticed " Fletcher , " her two-year-old male Siamese , hunched under a chair across the room . Fletcher was seldom seen sitting still , and he obviously was not up to indulging in his usual acts of mischief with his three feline litter mates . The big cat howled in pain when he was picked up , and his owner noticed patches of foamy vomitus on the rug near the chair . The woman called my office , and I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . Fletcher had a two-foot-long strand of tinsel in his intestines and required abdominal surgery and intense supportive care to remove the foreign body . He recovered without complication and lived to be 17 years old . <p> Such a scenario results when a pet swallows a string like object . At Christmas this is usually ribbon , tinsel , or yarn . The intestine actually climbs along the length of the material to form a compacted , accordion-like mass that , unless promptly removed by a surgeon , obstructs the bowel and often kills the pet . You should dispose of used ribbon immediately , eliminate string like decorations , and gather up yarn and other handicraft materials to prevent this problem . <p> Also , broken items and small toys swallowed by pets cause gastrointestinal irritation and possible obstruction . These items should be promptly removed from the pet 's environment . Dietary Hazards <p> Many of the dietary dangers of the holidays stem from well-meaning people sharing rich feasts with begging pets . In some cases , eating even a little excess fat can trigger a fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape from the inflamed pancreas and actually start to digest the animal 's own surrounding tissues . Staff veterinarians at the University of California School of Veterinary Medicine at Davis , California , have told me this is one of their most common ailments of the Christmas season . It is easy to avoid simply by withholding rich , fatty foods from your pets . <p> Bones are another common problem for our four-legged companions . Dr. Laura Stanisch , a veterinarian in Kane , Pennsylvania , reports : " Gastrointestinal problems associated with ingesting bones are my most frequently seen holiday-related illnesses . " The bones can cause widespread inflammation of the digestive tract and may even puncture the intestines , resulting in fatal peritonitis . Eliminating your pet 's access to bones is the best precaution . <p> Chocolate is another holiday-season hazard for pets . A source of theobromine , a caffeine-like substance , chocolate in large amounts can cause hyperexcitability and , sometimes , fatal irregular heartbeats . Keep candy and cooking chocolate out of reach of pets . Sharp Objects <p> On Christmas Eve 1992 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a four-year-old female Irish setter , who was bleeding profusely from the foot pads of her right front paw . While chasing the family cat through the living room , Brandy had knocked a glass Christmas ornament from the tree and stepped on it . She had soaked through two inches of towels and Ace bandage material by the time she arrived at my clinic . I anesthetized Brandy and sutured the cut foot . Although a bit groggy from the anesthetic , she was able to go home that night . <p> Another common problem stemming from sharp objects at Christmas is eye injury from pine needles . Usually these are minor abrasions of the cornea , but they do cause the pet extreme pain and can permanently scar the eye surface . <p> Rambunctious pets should not be permitted near the tree or other sources of sharp objects . Cats are notorious for leaping onto Christmas trees , especially if pursued by other pets . <p> Every Christmas , many of us include our pets in the tradition of gift-giving . Little toys , special treats , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually involved . Perhaps the best gift you can give is taking a few extra precautions to ensure your pets will also be with you for the next holiday season . <p> ILLUSTRATION : Lighted candles , hot electrical decorations , and open fireplace screens hold potential dangers for romping household pets . <p> By Gregory J.
