<p> When we pulled up at Luther Place shelter on the morning of the trip , Fannie was standing outside in a basement stairwell . She was smoking furiously . Other homeless people were milling around . The word had spread fast : <p> Two men are taking her home . <p> " I do n't inhale , " Fannie said , not really talking to us . " Just puff . Yeah , I 'm nervous . Nervous as a damn cat . Have n't slept since I been in here . Took cold too . Been out on that bench all winter and did fine and came in here and caught a damn cold . " <p> She had lipstick on , her clothes were clean , her face had an almost rosy glow . Her things were in a maroon plastic Hecht 's bag . I 'd never seen her look so good . " Yeah , hope my brother thinks so , " she replied . <p> " Witch , " she said a minute later . " Now you guys are stuck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we said . <p> A woman named Karen , who 's at the shelter a lot , hugged her , started crying . " I 'm so happy for you , Fannie , " she said . " Be good to your people . They love you . " <p> Karen followed us to the car . We got Fannie belted in and were starting to pull away . Karen made an almost panicky motion to roll down the window . " You do n't know anybody 's going to Paris , France ? " she said . <p> We were n't going to France . We were going to Mountain City , Tenn. , in the company of a 66-year-old semi-blind and beat-up but oddly vital homeless woman who 'd spent the winter wrapped in blankets and sleeping bags on a park bench in McPherson Square  --  and her nights up against a plate-glass window under an overhang of K Street . Her full name is Fannie Eldreth Ray . It was a trip of about 370 miles that took roughly eight hours . And it took her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appeal <p> Three weeks before , a semi-retired Tennessee tobacco grower and cattle raiser with a weak heart had called The Washington Post . He 'd read my portrait of his older sister early in the new year in a Style section series on the homeless . She happened to be a sister he 'd seen once since World War II . <p> Now Arlis Eldreth spoke simply . " She 's my flesh and blood . I ca n't sleep nights thinking about it . I get up and walk around . She has a place here . She does n't have to live like that . If you could just get her to come . " <p> Could we ? Right up until the moment we left , that was never entirely sure . Because Fannie 's apprehension about going back to her people seemed exactly the measure of her desire to make such a journey . <p> The next several weeks were not without a certain ribald strain . Robin Marcus-Vazques , director of the homeless senior center at Luther Place Memorial Church on Thomas Circle , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and now she too was feeling the sting of Fannie 's abuse as the actuality of the trip bore in . Robin cut Fannie 's hair , scrounged some clean clothes for her , found her a plastic travel satchel with makeup cases , took her fine old hand and told her everything was going to be all right . <p> Two days before we left , Fannie and I met at Robin 's office and put in a call to Arlis in Mountain City . Fannie was fidgety . <p> On the phone to her brother , she said , " Well , I 'm ashamed for you to see me this way . You know I 've always paid my own way . Worked my whole damn life . Have n't asked anybody for anything . " <p> You could n't hear the talk on the other end of the line . <p> " How old are you ? " she said to Arlis . " Well then , how old am I ? Oh , come on . " <p> She asked about Eddie Dean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , well , I guess we 're coming , " she told her brother . " Friday , they tell me . Sure , I know how to get there . Heck , yeah , I want to come . " <p> When she got off , she said , " I just ca n't figure out what 's happening . " <p> She slept in the shelter those last two nights  --  and despised it . Robin had nudged her into coming indoors . She was afraid something might go wrong at the last minute if Fannie slept on the sidewalks of K Street . " People get raped out there , robbed , the worst things imaginable , " Robin said . <p> Tennessee Bound <p> " It 's through Baltimore , is n't it ? Is n't that how you go ? " Fannie said as we were starting out at the tag end of morning rush hour on K Street . " Well , maybe that 's how you go on the bus . " <p> After we had gotten her things in the trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat so she could spread herself out , she 'd said , staring in , not yet taking possession of this enclosed space , " Mmm , looks a little like the bench . " <p> We left about 9:15 and pulled onto Muddy Branch Road in Johnson County , Tenn. , a little after 5 . Three of us were going . The third was Tom McClenahan . He 's 38 and works for a packager in Alexandria . For six months he had been visiting and aiding Fannie Ray on her Washington park bench . She wanted him to go on this trip . <p> He showed her where the seat belt was , offered to help her with it . " I 'm not going to cause any trouble , " she said . We laughed out loud . <p> Basically , we sailed the interstates  --  got onto I-66 at the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge , caught I-81 at Front Royal , curved south , split the Shenandoah Valley , wove in and out of the Blue Ridge . Three travelers riding on the spine of time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Which she left behind at about age 15 . In all these years she had been back once . On a Greyhound . <p> She never once the entire day asked us if she could go to the bathroom . She just sat in the back , bulked up in her newly cleaned pink goose parka . Of this parka , she said : " Feather coat . This one I got on does n't have any holes in it . Last one , I 'd sit there , the damn feathers blowing around me on the bench . " <p> I now think she would have gladly gone as far as Key West without asking us to pull over . " Time myself , " she said . " You 're outdoors on the bench all day , you time yourself . Got to . Otherwise , you 'll be pissing right and left . " <p> Her amazing kidneys notwithstanding , I think not needing to get out and go to the bathroom was also about something else : She just wanted to get to Tennessee  --  no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in the bargain a homeless and impecunious woman was teaching two middle-class men something about patience , about not needing things you think you need . Because we were the ones who kept having to pull over for Dr Pepper and bags of Planters peanuts and coffee at Hardee 's . <p> At one point when she had n't spoken to either Tom or me for many miles  --  I think we 'd just passed Lexington , Va .  --  I turned around and said , " You okay back there , Fannie ? " She did n't answer . Her head was reclined against the top of the seat , her mouth was open and aimed toward the roof of the car , her body seemed rigid . Was she dead ? <p> She kind of cocked open one eye . " I 'm thinking about my brother , " she said . <p> The very act of being borne back to Tennessee seemed to be unearthing in a memory-damaged woman some rich and unexpected reservoirs of recollection . Maybe it was the hum of the tires . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in bites , without particular logic or continuity . But you could get the flow of it . <p> " Granny had 13 , " she said . " Kids . Fell off the porch and died . I always thought one of my aunts pushed her . " <p> " Sylvie 's in West Virginia , " she told us . " Visey 's oldest . She takes snuff . Got ta see my cousin , Etta Mae . Always called her Tex . " <p> She would perk up , fall quiet , lean forward to peer out the window as if she were encountering visions . " Lots of these farms look like farms down home , " she said , nodding gravely . " ' Baccer . Wheat . Cows . Pigs . " <p> She saw a small landing strip parallel to the highway . Her head came halfway around as she stared at a plane lined up on the tarmac , as if the thing were going to race us . <p> " Had a parakeet once , " she announced . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd say , ' Here come them drunks . ' " This memory did n't have to do with Tennessee ; it had to do with lost years up north with a man named Steve . He 's dead now , she says . He was a Greek American from West Virginia . She loved him and lived with him and ca n't summon his last name . <p> " Had a pooch once , " she said . " Friend of mine took him outside , let him get away . " <p> About an hour into the trip , apropos of nothing , she said , " It ran away from me last week . My mind . Went all around the block , would n't come back . " She cackled . <p> At another point , talking of her former husband 's mother , whom she 'd been devoted to and taken care of in her final illness many years ago in Florida , before a lot of things in Fannie 's life turned bad and a blur , she said : " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " <p> She described with such vividness that you could almost see them " all those white strawberries up on Strawberry Hill . That 's where the family cemetery is . They wo n't be out yet end up . " <p> Why , the strawberries on Strawberry Hill are " this big , " Fannie said , forming an oval with her leathery thumb and forefinger . " Pure white . Up on Forge Creek . You ca n't believe how juicy . " <p> There were points during the southward roll when Fannie Ray began to talk almost with longing of the ones she was leaving behind  --  the other homeless men and women in McPherson Square and Farragut Square and Lafayette Park who did n't have a Tennessee brother to help save them . <p> " Lee , " she said , her voice sad . " He used to sit behind my bench and watch my stuff . " And : " Paula owes me $ 10 . " And : " Wilma could speak two languages , you know . " Wilma was Fannie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep together on K. She was an alcoholic . They found her dead at Christmastime . <p> A Woman 's History <p> There are great unexplained gaps in this homeless life , as perhaps in any homeless life . How did a woman get from there to here  --  there being Johnson County , Tenn. , half a century ago . And here being all the bad that has happened in the time since . <p> But good too . <p> Fannie has a story about going to New York as a teenager and being caught by police and stuck in a convent school . I think none of it is true . Her brother thinks this too . <p> This is known : Decades ago she worked at a powder plant in Elkton , Md . This also is known : She was once married to a man named Bill Ray . He repaired motors . He was a sailor , or at least she says that . They broke up . She thinks he 's somewhere in Florida now , if alive . <p> In the ' 50s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and her husband in old city directories . <p> Two and a half months ago , when I first encountered the McPherson Square life of Fannie Ray , her brother told me on the phone from Mountain City : " I think it must have been our mama dying young . That and the alcohol . It just ate up her life . I was 11 when our mama died , she was 13 . There were six of us kids in the family . She went up north to work . She disappeared and I never did see her again . I lost track of her for 30 years . I called and called and could n't get a trace . " <p> Arlis lost her at about age 15 . He 'd gone north to Maryland to make a living too , his heart always in Tennessee . Eventually he went back . But he could never find his sister . Then one day Fannie rode a bus to Tennessee . <p> " It was like seeing somebody back from the dead , " Arlis said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northeast Washington . Since last March she had been in McPherson Square . Her pattern throughout this winter was the following : All day she 'd sit in the park , same bench , except for several hours at midday when she 'd walk up to Luther Place Memorial Church . She 'd have lunch there and maybe some TV . Sometimes she 'd do a wash , sometimes she 'd bathe . Afterward she 'd come back to the square . People would pass and hand her bills , which she 'd tuck inside her glove . At dark she 'd cross K Street and make her bed on the sidewalk . <p> She spent Christmas Day alone , except for a visit from Tom McClenahan . He drove in to see her from his home outside Leesburg . On Christmas Eve a stranger came by and handed her $ 15 in a church envelope . She left her bench once on Christmas Day  --  for coffee at McDonald 's . She talked a little to the counter clerk . <p> What She Asked For <p> About halfway to Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a new pair of sneaks . Although she was a traveler who asked almost nothing of us , Fannie Ray made it clear she did n't want to face her brother wearing moldy shoes . She almost seemed to be fixating on the subject of shoes . These insulated black boots with mottled fur that she 'd been wearing all winter , hated the damn things . <p> " Not that they stink , " she said . " My feet never did stink , that 's one thing , I do n't know why . " <p> We found an outlet in a mall of outlets south of Roanoke . Fannie was in the place maybe 30 seconds before she 'd made up her mind : white low-cuts , 38 smackers and change , although she was n't aware of the price . That was stickered on the undersides , and she did n't turn them over . <p> " I 'd like these , " she said . " My size too . " <p> " But would n't you like to try a few pair on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nope . " <p> But she did agree to try this pair on . She sat in a chair and pulled up her pant leg . She had on a thick fire-engine-red sock that went halfway up her leg . " I got short wide feet , " she said . " This is the foot I broke . Fell over a pipe . Feel that knot . You feel that lump ? Not supposed to be there . " <p> I felt it . It was hard as a squash ball . I helped tie the laces . <p> Fannie wore her blinding-white sneaks out of the store . She was so proud . Her walk almost had bounce in it . The clerk watched us go from the window . <p> When we were rolling again , Fannie said , as though she were announcing it to the air of the world : " It does n't seem possible I could be this lucky . How did I get off that damn bench ? " <p> Two in the Half-Light <p> Her brother was waiting by the back door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it carefully , peering through the side window into the rear seat . It was close to dark now . <p> " Get out of there , Sis , " Arlis Eldreth said , his voice choking a little on the final word . <p> " I do n't know you , " Fannie said , and you could hear small liquid in hers too . In the previous few minutes , as the car had passed through a valley she dimly recognized , she 'd patted into place the clipped pewter-white hair that was hidden beneath a silky scarf ; she 'd buttoned up the old yellow cardigan they 'd given her at the shelter . <p> Two strangers who were n't strangers stood in half-light and shivery mountain evening air . It was as if whole lifetimes , oceans of awkwardness , were conspiring to keep them from touching . This was the last two feet of a journey , and neither of them could seem to make it . They sort of rocked back and forth for several seconds . One started to grin . The other grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's arms . <p> Not for long , though . <p> " Della 's got you the biggest piece of apple pie you ever saw , " the mountain brother said . <p> " And how is Della anyway ? " the wandering sister answered . <p> Della , Arlis 's wife , was standing on the porch in an apron holding open the metal storm door . Waving . <p> On a hill up above the neat white frame house was a patch of reddish earth newly plowed . It was for the spring garden . And next to this patch was an acre and a half of turned ground where the burley tobacco would shortly be going in . And trickling down along the edge of Della and Arlis 's groomed front yard was a stream about a foot wide . It was very clear and looked very cold . <p> Across the fence row , in a pasture , 15 head of cattle stood like cardboard cutouts . <p> Fannie Ray , against odds , had come home . <p> Later that evening at the kitchen table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when night had dropped a coal-black net over the house , when the brother and sister inside were cutting up and talking almost nonstop in their coded sibling shorthand , the younger of the two said , " I 'm going to put you to work in that garden up yonder there , Sis . Ai n't going to be any sitting around on benches down here . Nosir . " <p> The reply from the older one seemed trapped somewhere between a snort and a grunt of approval . <p> Morning Reflections <p> " Guess how many I seen eating at one table ? " Arlis says . <p> " I do n't know , " I say . <p> " Thirty-five , one big round table , " he says . " That 's how it was up there on Eldreth Mountain 50 years ago . " <p> " We were raised up in a log house , " Fannie says . <p> " Gone now , " says Arlis . <p> " Those were sled-drawn roads , " Fannie says . " You never saw a car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three cars on all of Forge Creek , " Arlis says . <p> " Walk 2 1/2 miles to school , " Fannie says . " Walk till your feet get sore . " <p> " Walk till your shoe leather wore out , " says Arlis . " You only had one pair , then you were done . You ca n't believe those times . " <p> " We were the closest , me and him , " Fannie says , motioning at her brother . <p> Next morning . We 're at the big table in the kitchen . Della is at the counter with her arms folded across her middle . Spring sun is slanting in behind her . Arlis , bulky and white-haired and freshly shaved , a man with music in his speech , a man with a heart bypassed six times , has come in from feeding the stock . He 's a happy guy . His sis is home . He slept last night . <p> The talk today is a river with a thousand currents . But the theme is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " She was our granny , " Fannie says . <p> " A midwife , " Arlis says . " They 'd come and get her at midnight with coal lanterns . " <p> Tom and I stayed at a motel last night . It was the sleep of the angels  --  I barely got the light out . Earlier , Arlis had taken the two of us into town for dinner . He said he intended to buy us the biggest damn steak in Johnson County . Arlis knew half the people in the restaurant . " This is the finest we got , " he said . " I 've only been here about once . " <p> At the restaurant I asked about the strawberries on Strawberry Hill . " I have no idea where she got that , " he said . <p> This morning Sis has on a blue oxford button-down shirt . Shelter donation . Her eyes are n't hidden by dark glasses . She looks years younger . <p> Last evening , out of Fannie 's earshot , Arlis had said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her voice . I would n't know her if I 'd met her out . " Then he 'd said : " I just hope she stays . I 'll buy her a trailer if I have to . " <p> This morning , again out of her earshot , he 'd said : " I wo n't be here long . It 's my heart . Then it 'll be the two of them . They 'll have each other . Della will treat her just like a sister . Della can get along with anybody . " <p> A little while ago , Arlis took us outside to the fruit cellar . Last fall , Della and her daughter , Francine , put up about 300 jars of beans , beets , corn , tomatoes . They can survive Armageddon with what 's in the fruit cellar . " Take your pick , boys , " Arlis said . I picked a quart of pickled beets . <p> We 're leaving now . It 's awkward . Will she be back on the bench in a week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fannie , but maybe Fannie too , are silently asking it . <p> And Fannie Eldreth Ray says , " Come back and visit me . " Which is what she 'd once said on the bench .
