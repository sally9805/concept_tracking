My father found himself in Boston once , ten thousand myths away from Oklahoma I think of him standing on the rim of the Atlantic , the horizon vertical as it describes the Upperworld and the Underworld . It was the water that attracted him , as if he were some kin to the Watermonster , as if he 'd heard the stories and the monster was the only one who could approximate the turmoil of knowledge . <p> And there was a woman involved . I imagine a woman as beautiful as his first love , a woman whose picture I 've kept in a suitcase he used for short journeys . Her name was Margaret . My sister 's name is Margaret . My brother married a Margaret . My best friend is Margaret . I wonder at the karma of naming . The story is uncovered in me yet provides an urge to get at this particular angel . <p> On New Year 's Eve my love and I drove to the wharf in a cold that forces one to understand the nature of cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , approximates beginnings though endings are particularly startling here . When the old ones discuss the origin , one version includes the first Muskogee rising from the mists in the East . I can imagine it , but not in the restaurant the size of a small ship filled with passengers who appear to have just arrived from England , Ireland , and parts of Germany and France . I think of my father in the bay loving ships . Not the sailing itself but the ability to sail over the terrible deep . <p> The Watermonster is found all over the world . The myth of Columbus includes illustrations of sea serpents crawling at the shelf of the end of the world . The Watermonster still lives in Oklahoma in lakes close to home and is known to appear to those who have lost too much in the War of Everyday . <p> After the flood that turned Fort Gibson upside down , I saw the Watermonster , my father not far behind me in our walk to measure damage and defeat . The monster stroked calmly in the afterburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures loss in terms of money . I understood it in the narrow gait of my father , whose losses I bore in cells storing memory . Maybe I did n't see the Watermonster but glimpsed a wayward angel as it dipped down and disappeared in the aftermath of the flood . I gained a sense of the power of the unknown locked in the unknown . The shifting image triggered the origin story and I realized that at ten years old I 'd have to begin all over again as if I 'd lost my place in the book of myths . Perhaps the Watermonster died in shame of being disbelieved . I know I bear the burden of explanation . <p> What would have driven my father from Oklahoma to Boston except for the promise of a good job , or a woman ? I asked him more than once about Boston and why the leap from one universe to the other . It remains a family mystery that no one knows about except me , and even then all I have to go on are his lips when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of an unbearable light as if it were Margaret . I need to know the story of Margaret in the world . When I was small I used to look up the meaning of names in the dictionary . Jo , was always joy . My sister 's name meant beloved gift . A pearl . I do n't think he ever got over the Margaret of his life . Nor did he ever get over my mother , who still says he 's the only man she ever loved . <p> At nearly forty I am thinking of the traps we all construct to absent memory . At low tide , pleasure boats tip precariously toward the mud . The blue moon gets ready for the new year as ships line up for war . I eat a plate of fried oysters , my favorite gift from the deep , and think of my father and his search for the pearl , for the beloved . Some things remain mystery . <p> When he died in ' 83 , he lived a few miles from the Gulf , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite . He paced back and forth in the sawing grass , impatient for me to arrive from New Mexico before he left from his home in oyster Creek . The return to the Milky Way involves a reenactment of the Muskogee creation story , as if you must wind back through all memory , all history , the Watermonster the ongoing companion to the left of you . That same look in his eyes , then he was gone . I could n't recover him from the deep . <p> <p> By Joy Harjo <p>
