Writer-Director Francis Veber has repeatedly insisted that The Dinner Game is founded in reality : at some point in the fairly recent past , Parisian sophisticates took to hunting down idiots , issuing straight-faced dinner invitations to them and then awarding a prize to the swell who brought the most excruciating bore to the party . <P> All Veber imagined was a situation where one of the smart set is obliged to deal with one of his victims , one on one , man to man . That is simply arranged : Pierre ( Thierry Lhermitte ) , a publisher , is suddenly immobilized by a backache on the very night he has asked Francois ( Jacques Villeret ) , an accountant who makes matchstick models of things like the Eiffel Tower and the Concorde , over for a drink before the fools ' parade .

One 's enjoyment of it may very well derive from the way it contrasts with the climate in which it is released .
