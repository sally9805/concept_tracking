Not every old-timer tooling about Florida in his giant Caddy , whomping along the interstate at 45 mph , is on his way to some early-bird special . An increasing number of these geezers are on far more purposeful travels . From what can be gathered from a quick swing through the leisure villages , it seems a lot of these guys , these erstwhile retirees , are actually on their way to tryouts with major league baseball teams . " And why not , " they say . " Everybody needs pitching . " // By now , who does n't know about Jim Palmer  --  seven years out of the big leagues and already elected to the Hall of Fame  --  and his comeback with the Baltimore Orioles ? No TV affiliate worth its minicam has failed to document this event . The Hall of Fame angle is so cute , but there 's also this : The man , for goodness ' sakes , is older than Nolan Ryan ! But Palmer is no isolated phenomenon this year . At 45 he 's the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the point man in this spring training 's particular folly . But there are some other guys warming up out there who have gone years since last walking off a major league mound . // Among them is Matt Keough , who last pitched in the major leagues in 1986 . After four years with the Hanshin Tigers in Japan , Keough , 35 , is trying out with the California Angels . Remember Goose Gossage ? He 's attempting to catch on with the Texas Rangers after a one-year tour with the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks . Not everybody has come from a rehabilitation tour in the Far East . One arrived from Whitefish , Mont . Steve Howe , 33 , whose history of drug and alcohol abuse got him banned from the game , is in the New York Yankees ' camp . Howe 's last big league out was on Sept. 28 , 1987 ; his last drink , Jan. 22 , 1989 . Mike Flanagan , who actually pitched in the majors last year-all of 20 innings  --  is trying to catch on with the Orioles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's final crime against fan sensibility was hanging on too long . Now players do n't just play until they re too old ; they play until they 're too old , and then they retire from the major leagues , and then they come back . " The competitive fires keep burning in a great athlete , even after he 's retired , " says Baltimore manager Frank Robinson . " Also , there is nice money to be made . " // There is that . Several in this ragtag rotation marvel at the vast sums they 've missed during their absence from the big leagues . Howe , who lived month to month and hand to mouth during his exile in Montana , thinks his banishment cost him as much at $10 million . He sees his comeback as an opportunity " to make a substantial amount of money for my family in a relatively short time . " For Howe , who startled the Yankees during his audition in late February with a fastball that scooted about the knees at 92 mph , that opportunity apparently depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . // Palmer , too , would seem to be money-motivated . Consider that , in Palmer 's long career with the Orioles , the most he ever earned in a season was $600,000 ; this season Roger Clemens will earn more than that in a month . When the minicams grouped in Miami  --  and later in Sarasota  --  to record Palmer 's improbable tale , they were denied any heroic explanations for his particular crime against nature . Instead , reporters heard talk of " assured income " and of a " $3,200 pay cut " from Palmer 's ESPN broadcasting gig and of " money-making alternatives . " Major league baseball as moonlighting. // In fact , he says he never would have picked up a baseball last winter if ESPN , in budget cutbacks , had n't tried to re-sign him to a three-year contract with reduced per-game payments . So , in what looked an awful lot like a negotiating wedge , Palmer began fooling around with a baseball in Mark Light Stadium at the University of Miami . There he happened to catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose pitching credentials amount to little more than eight appearances in relief for Miami in 1985 . " You 'll never get into the Hall of Fame with those mechanics , " Collazo told him . Palmer replied as evenly as he could : " I 'm already in the Hall of Fame . " // Coach Laser ( could he be called otherwise ? ) made Palmer 's delivery more compact , using unorthodox drills whereby Palmer put a knee or a foot on a chair as he threw . Before long , Palmer found that he could put the ball where he wanted with less effort and pain . His comeback thus acquired a genuine momentum , and scouts were invited to come and assure his income . // But hardly anybody believes Palmer 's comeback is only about money . For a man whose midriff is nearly as famous as Madonna 's , it is fair to suspect that a certain vanity is involved . " I do n't know if it was the Jockey ads or what , " he says , " but a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still pitch . " Because Palmer remains a legend in Baltimore , the Orioles felt obliged to find out . They sent scouts to see him three times , including minor league pitching instructor Dick Bosman , who beat Palmer for the American League ERA title in 1969 . Although none of the observers required surgery to have their eyes put back into their sockets , the Orioles invited Palmer to their camp in Sarasota . There he has failed to excite either ridicule or astonishment . He 's in fabulous condition , no question . But no matter whom he lines up with on the row of practice mounds , there is more pop in the gloves of catchers other than his . // The Orioles are hoping that Palmer , so prideful that throughout his career he refused to take the mound unless he was 100% , wo n't allow himself to be embarrassed . " Jim 's a real pro , " says Roland Hemond , Baltimore 's general manager . " He 'll let us know if he can do it or not . " // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of excellence , feel compelled to play along , offering Palmer every possible courtesy and opportunity to succeed . " If Jim Palmer wants to make a comeback , " says Robinson , who was Palmer 's teammate for six seasons , " he deserves to do it in an Orioles uniform . And if he does pull this off , I would n't want it to be for any other team . I 'm rooting for him . " But there is no real spot for him on the roster . And encouragement has been slight . // " How 's Hall of Fame doing ? " somebody asks a coach . // " It 's early , " he answers , and turns away . // In Palmer 's quest to prove that you can throw home again , almost every particular of the episode has been exotic . There has never been a comeback quite like it . But some of the spring 's other returns from retirement have that more familiar whiff of desperation or , rather , refusal to give up on the good life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you do n't know how good it is until you 're out of it . " // At a locker near Palmer 's , Flanagan struggles with that dilemma of whether to leave gracefully or leave at all . Flanagan , the 1979 American League Cy Young winner as an Oriole , appeared to have erred on the side of leaving ugly when the Toronto Blue Jays unceremoniously cut him last May . But Flanagan faulted the strike-shortened spring training for his performance and decided to work his arm back into shape and try again . " And by September I felt like I was throwing too good to stop , " he says . A chance meeting with Hemond at the Hall of Fame ceremonies in August encouraged Flanagan to visit with the Orioles . " Some guys get to the point where enough is enough , " says Flanagan . " And some guys just love the game . " And some guys are lefthanded pitchers , which gives Flanagan more than a sentimentalist 's chance to make it . // Down the road at Port Charlotte is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although Gossage 's career has observed the typical trajectory of hardthrowing relievers  --  an ERA that rises pretty much in accordance with age  --  he finds explanations for failure elsewhere . Don Zimmer , his manager on the Chicago Cubs in 1988 , " may have been insecure " in his leadership , laying excessive blame on his closer . Roger Craig , Gossage 's manager on the San Francisco Giants the next year , " never welcomed me. " // Says Gossage , " I never had the opportunity to live and die my way . I struggled . I 've always struggled at times . Remember that miracle season in 1978 with the Yankees , 14 games out and we come back to win the World Series ? Well , we 'd never have been 14 games out if it was n't for my horrible pitching . But when you 're 21 and do n't get guys out , you 're in a slump . It happens at 39 and you 're done . " // Texas manager Bobby Valentine promises to give the Goose more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Valentine said after watching him in a recent workout . " If he does n't get any better , then it 's borderline . " // Gossage figures a shot is all he needs , and that he will get better . " The way I 'm throwing , if I was a prospect out of college , I 'd be a pretty good prospect . " But being a 39-year-old fireballer brings a different set of standards to bear . " You like to think you ca n't fool yourself , " he says . " I guess Sugar Ray Leonard did n't think he was over the hill either . " // Across the country in Mesa , Ariz. , Keough , a member of the Oakland A 's from 1977 to ' 83 , is on the hill again . His four-year tour with Hanshin ended last year when he was released . So he dropped by Anaheim Stadium during voluntary workouts this winter and asked Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann if he could throw . Lachemann was surprised at Keough 's condition , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understands what he 's up against . " When you 're gone four years , people assume you 're gone , " he says . " You have to prove you 're still alive . " // The far more intriguing comeback is Howe 's . He was baseball 's most tragic tale of talent betrayed by drugs . The National League Rookie of the Year with the Dodgers in 1980 , he was all arrogance and heat ; just three years later , his cocaine-induced slide left him bankrupt . Howe concedes that he was resistant to reform , and it was n't until 1988 , armed with a combination of newly found religion and continued drug therapy , that he tapped into a life of sobriety. // By then , the addiction appeared to have ended Howe 's ability to earn major league money again , although he never really believed that . After he was suspended for the sixth time , in 1988 , he was cast out of baseball by imperial edict . That was later amended to allow him to play minor league ball in 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . So Howe pitched for Class A Salinas last season  --  he had a 2.12 ERA in 10 games  --  and for Mazatlan in the Mexican Pacific League this winter . And maybe he will pitch for the Yankees this summer . " They lost Rags Dave Righetti , " said Howe upon his arrival in Fort Lauderdale two weeks ago , " and here I come . " // But Howe , who showed up in camp at least looking like some humble rookie ( he borrowed Don Mattingly 's spikes for his audition and wore some flannels that appeared to date from his Dodger days ) , revels more in his sobriety than in his chance to pitch again . " Do you know what it 's like to wake up in the morning and not have to go out and check the car , to ask around and make sure you did n't hurt anybody ? " he asks . " I 'd like to make this team . I intend to . But for some reason I feel like I 've already got it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club this spring , because as anyone can tell you , everybody needs pitching . And the wisdom of age and experience is perhaps better applied on a pitching mound than in most places in sport . But some of the returnees are probably fooling themselves . The miracles of spring do not ordinarily come by the half dozen . For the youngsters who dress beside them in the clubhouse , though , these aged hopefuls offer an unnerving glimpse of the future . And there 's a message attached . Maybe you should enjoy this game while you can , is the simple lesson  --  because you 'll never be able to enjoy it as long as you want .
