Chapter 1 : A Glimpse into the Future Holly 's crystal shop looked small inside because every available space was utilized . The air reeked of incense and there was some kind of Far Eastern music playing . Large crystals , all shiny and jagged , stood on antique tables at the center of the shop and tall oak bookshelves lined the side walls . I turned my gaze to the books alongside me and noticed that the shelves were filled with titles describing meditation practices , astrology , faith healing , the afterlife and paraphysical wonders , whatever they were . Along the back wall was a long glass case crowded with birth stones , as well as amethyst , blue topaz , citrine , garnet and other minerals set in earrings . On the shelves behind the glass case were boxes of incense , teas , Tarot cards and herbal medicines . The ceiling was covered with charts of the constellations , along with posters explaining the powers of various stones . Above the cash register , framed in flowers , was a photograph of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her about meditation . A curtain of multicolored beads hung in the doorway that led to the rooms in back of the shop . We 'd only been in the shop a few moments when a young man in a wheelchair , whom I knew had to be Billy Maxwell , parted the curtain and appeared . He had silky ebony hair that reached his shoulders and framed his face , a face that had an angelic glow because of his rich , almost alabaster complexion . As soon as he saw us , his light green eyes brightened and a gentle smile appeared on his face . Perhaps because of his disability and dependence upon his arms and shoulders , his upper body was firm , muscular , obvious even in his loose , light blue shirt . He wore a pair of dark jeans , white socks and sneakers . There was a large , round gem in a gold casing dangling on a gold chain around his neck and his right ear was pierced and filled with a turquoise stone earring . " Hi , Billy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed on me . " Hi . You got here earlier than I expected . How was your trip ? " he asked her , while still concentrating on me . " Good . This is Melody . " " Pleased to meet you , " Billy said , extending his hand . He had long , soft fingers and a palm that was warm against mine . " Hi , " I said . There seemed to be such peacefulness in his face , a calmness that helped me feel at home . " So you 're on a big journey , " he said , sitting back . " Yes , " I answered , unable to hide my nervousness . " The Chinese say a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step and you 've taken that single step . That 's usually the hardest , " he added . " Now the momentum will take over and carry you to where you have to go . " I nodded and then glanced at Holly , not sure what I should say or do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Melody . Billy 's the best tour guide in our galaxy . " Billy smiled but kept his eyes on me . It was strange having him look at me so intently , but I did n't feel intimidated or self-conscious . I felt his sincerity , his concern and it was as if he and I had known each other for years instead of minutes . " What 's been happening here ? " Holly asked before we started across the shop . " Well , Mrs. Hadron 's daughter gave birth prematurely early this morning , but the baby is doing well . She stopped by to thank us for the smoky quartz  --  it really helped her daughter get through the crisis . And Mr. Brul was here this morning to tell you that the variscite helped him recall a past life . He had vivid details to share . " " Past life ? " I asked . " Yes . He saw himself in England , mid-nineteenth century . He said he was a bookkeeper , which made sense to him . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all have former lives ? " I asked , looking from him to Holly and then back to him . " Yes , " Billy said smiling . " I have no doubt . " " Well , for now we 'll have to concentrate on her present life , " Holly said . " This way , honey . " " I 'm sorry I ca n't help with your bags , " Billy apologized . " We 'll be fine , " Holly replied . " See you in a few minutes . " " Welcome again , Melody , and do n't worry . There is good energy surrounding you . " His eyes grew small . " Things will work out for you , " he said with confidence . It was as if he really could look into the future . " Thank you , " I said . The door chimes rang as two elderly women entered the shop . While Billy attended to them , Holly led me through the curtain of beads to the living quarters at the rear of the shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she explained . I followed her through the doorway to a short hallway . There was a small living room on the right with a sofa , a smaller settee , two easy chairs , a glass table and two standing lamps . " This is Billy 's bedroom , " she said nodding at the first door on the left . " It makes it easier for him to be closest to the shop . I have the next room and you can take this room across the hall , " she said opening the door . It was a very small room with one window that opened on the rear of the building . There was n't much to look at : just a driveway that provided access to garbage trucks and a small , fenced in area for someone 's dog . The dog was in its doghouse at the moment , with just its large black paws visible . The window had light brown cotton curtains and a window shade with a quarter moon and a star painted on it . There was a large ball-shaped mauve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light brown comforter and matching pillows . It looked comfortable . Actually , the room was cozy with its tan carpet , its dark pink walls , lamp , rocking chair , table and matching dark pine dresser . A set of chimes dangled in the corner above the chair , barely moving at the moment . " This room gets a lot of use , " Holly explained . " Many people who belong to our network of friends pass through New York going one way or another and stop over for a short visit . I know it 's small but ... " " It 's fine , Holly . Thank you . " " Why do n't you just settle in . The bathroom 's at the end of the hallway . Freshen up . I 'll do the same and call my sister . Then we 'll have some dinner . Billy does all the cooking , you know . " " Really ? " " And he 's quite the gourmet . " " I forgot what you told me about why he 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mugged , about five years ago not that far from here . He ran and the mugger shot at him and shattered Billy 's spinal cord . " " How horrible , but I 'm glad you told me . I did n't want to say anything wrong . " " Do n't worry about that . Billy is quite at peace with himself and his condition . Because of his spirituality , he pities more people than pity him . I ca n't think of a moment when he was depressed these past few years . Anyone who comes in here feeling the least bit sorry for himself usually leaves feeling ashamed of his own selfpity after they talk to Billy . And he 's a wonderful poet , published in many literary magazines . We 'll get him to read you something later . " Holly put her arm around my shoulders and squeezed . " Just like Billy said , everything 's going to turn out fine , Melody . " I nodded . The discoveries , the quick decision to make the journey and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city was , suddenly filled me with a deep fatigue . I felt my body sink , my legs soften , my eyelids turn to lead . " Take a rest , " Holly wisely advised . As soon as she left me I lay down and dropped my head to the pillow . A tinkle , like the sound of glasses being jiggled in a dishwasher tray , woke me . For a few seconds , I did n't know where I was . The sun had gone down and the room was filled with shadows . Someone had come in while I was asleep and turned on the small lamp by the rocking chair . I sat up to grind the sleep out of my eyes . The window was slightly open and the breeze that passed through made the chimes hanging from the ceiling tap , which solved the mystery of the sound . I heard a gentle knock at the door . " Yes ? " Holly , dressed in one of her bright yellow dresses with a yellow and green headband , her silver crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the open door . " You 've been sleeping quite a while . Getting hungry ? " " Yes , " I said . " Good . I spoke to my sister Dorothy and everything is set . As soon as we know when your flight arrives , I 'll call her and she and her driver will meet you at the airport . My friend is working on the ticket now and promises to call within the hour . Billy 's been preparing a feast . Freshen up and come out when you 're ready , " she said . " Thank you , Holly . " " You 're welcome sweetheart . Oh , " she said before closing the door again , " I spoke to Kenneth . He sends his regards and his best wishes , " she added , but I picked up a change in her tone . " Was something wrong ? " " He just sounded a little down . Maybe he misses us . Misses you , especially , " she offered . " He 's probably working twenty hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said with a small laugh . Then she closed the door and I got up and opened my suitcase to pick out something to wear . After I had washed up , fixed my hair , and changed , I went out to the kitchen . The aroma of the food was tantalizing and made my stomach churn . Billy , bent over a table obviously built lower to accommodate him in his wheelchair , turned as I entered . Holly was in the shop with a customer . " Hi . How are you doing ? " Billy asked . " I feel better after my nap . Looks like I slept longer than I thought I would . Can I help ? " " Everything 's done , " he said nodding at the table he had set . " Holly will close the shop in about ten minutes and we 'll have dinner . Oh , let me light the candles , " he said . " I like to dim the room when we eat . It heightens the sense of taste when you diminish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " No . " " It 's true , " he said , laughing at my skepticism . " Did n't you ever notice that food tastes better in the dark ? Assuming it 's good food , that is . " He lit each candle and then returned to his work table . " How long have you been cooking ? " " Since I became a vegetarian . It 's just a lot easier to cook for yourself and besides , preparing good food is an art and very self-satisfying . Most people today think it 's an ordeal , but that 's because they do n't take pride in what they do . They do n't look for the essence , the inner rewards . Life for them is full of burdens . They 're never at ease and they rarely enjoy their own accomplishments . Their days are full of stress and negative energy . " He turned back to me . " I do n't mean to bore you with a lecture . Holly says once I get started , I 'm like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , really , I do n't mind , " I said . " Why are you a vegetarian ? " Billy paused in his food preparation and turned his chair so he could face me . " I follow many Buddhist traditions and consider all animal life sacred , but other religious groups practice vegetarianism as well . In the Roman Catholic Church , for example , it has been practiced monastically by Trappists since 1666 and among Protestants by Seventh Day Adventists . I believe that the killing of animals is unnecessary and cruel and can conceivably lead to disregard for human life . It 's also a healthier way to live , as long as you do n't neglect your protein . " He smiled . " Now you think I 'm some sort of kook , right ? " " No , " I said , " but I know a lot of people in Cape Cod who would be unhappy if people stopped eating fish . " " Oh , well , for that I make an exception , " he said with a wink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as I know there are no chemicals added . " " Something smells very good , " I admitted . " Tonight 's menu , " Billy announced , sitting up straighter in his chair . " We shall begin with chilled okra yogurt soup , then an orange , walnut and romaine salad , followed by rice , carrot , mushroom and pecan burgers on toasted seven-grain bread . For dessert , I have prepared a carob cake with carob ricotta icing . Something special in celebration of your arrival , " he added . My silence brought laughter to his lips . " Do n't know what you 're in for , huh ? " he said . " It sounds ... interesting , " I said , and he laughed harder . " What 's going on in here ? " Holly asked as she entered the room . " I just described the menu to Melody and she was speechless . Then she said it was interesting . How 's that for diplomacy ? " " Oh . Do n't worry , Melody . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you close up ? " Billy asked . She nodded . " Then let the feast begin , " he declared , slapping his hands together . Once again I asked to help , but Billy insisted I was the guest of honor . It amazed me how quickly he could move about the kitchen , spinning himself on the wheels of his chair . Holly turned the lights down and took her seat . The soup was delicious and refreshing . The salad was very good , but I was most surprised by the vegetable burgers because they did resemble meat in their texture and even their flavor . " How do you do this ? " I asked , munching away . " He has magic hands , " Holly said . Billy asked questions about Cape Cod , my life there and my life before in Sewell , West Virginia . He was a good listener , absorbing every detail . Occasionally , he and Holly exchanged a look that told me they had discussed me and my situation at length . " You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to why I was on this trip , " that places change people . We react to our environment , to the other people around us , to the climate and especially to the sort of energy force that is there . Even if this woman is your mother , she might be more of a stranger to you now than you would expect . " " I hope not , " I said mournfully . " Just be prepared , " Billy advised . " I do n't know how to prepare for something like that . " " Maybe I can help you , " he said , his eyes intense . The telephone rang and Holly spoke to her travel agent friend . When she hung up , she told me my flight was set for the day after tomorrow . " It will bring you into Los Angeles about eleven A.M. Pacific time . I 'll call Dorothy and give her the flight number and time , " she added , returning to the phone . My heart began to pound now that my plans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw he was smiling softly at me , his eyes full of comfort . It helped me relax again . This time when Holly hung up , she shook her head . " Dorothy will take you to some Beverly Hills restaurant for lunch , where you will eat a piece of celery and a cupful of pasta for a hundred dollars , I 'm sure , " she said . " Think of my sister as someone who has to be humored . La La Land is just Disneyland for the rich and famous . " " Oh , now let her make her own conclusions , Holly , " Billy said charitably . " Who knows ? She may enjoy that world . " " Not this down-to-earth girl . You listen to me , Melody . Get in and get out . Find out what you have to find out and if it is n't what you expected or what you want , put yourself on the next plane out and come back here if you like before you return to Cape Cod , " Holly said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister tells you and be skeptical about the other ten percent . " The phone rang again . Holly spoke to someone for a few moments and then , when she hung up , she announced she had to leave for a while . " I have to do an astrological reading for someone . It 's way past due . I hate to leave you your first night here , but ... " " She 'll be fine , " Billy said . " Will you read her one of your poems ? " " If she would like , " he replied , turning to me . " Oh yes , please , " I said . " But I insist that you let me help clean up . " " No problem . I 'm a gourmet cook and all gourmet cooks let people help clean up . " He and Holly laughed and I smiled widely . I had been in New York only a few hours , but I felt more at home here than I had at the homes of my so-called relatives and family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing as positive energy and maybe he would give me enough to help me get through the dark valleys and tunnels that loomed ahead . The question was , would I find any light at the end ? After I straightened up the kitchen and put dishes and cooking implements away , I stopped by the living room where Billy sat gazing at a notebook in his lap . " Come on in , " he said . " I was sitting here thinking about what I had written that would be most appropriate for your circumstances and it 's taken me all the way back to my rebirth . " " Rebirth ? " He nodded and flicked some strands of hair from his eyes . He had that soft , angelic smile on his lips again . I had never met anyone who seemed so at peace with himself . It reminded me of the deep calm before a storm , when the whole world seemed to be holding its breath . Cary called it Mother Nature 's deception , claiming she tricked us into believing all was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , rebirth , for I was dead to so much before my ... my death , " he said . " I was like most people , blind and deaf , confused by the clatter and noise , chasing material things , living on the lowest level and never hearing the song . " " The song ? " " The spiritual song , the voice deep within us all , the voice that links us to each other , to every living and even non-living thing . Even the man who shot me is part , of this overall spiritual essence , and in that sense , we re part of each other , forever . " " Did they catch him ? " " No , but that does n't matter . He shot himself when he shot me . We 're eternally tied together by that act . " " You mean you could forgive him for it ? " I asked , astounded . " Of course . There 's nothing to forgive . The negative energy that was in him is what must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that , just as I was captured and for a while made prisoner by the bullet that shattered my spine . " " How can you be so positive ? " I asked with curious astonishment . " I was lying on my hospital bed , feeling terribly sorry for myself , cataloguing all the things I would no longer be able to do , regretting how much I was dependent on other people , in truth , wishing I would die , " he explained , " when suddenly Holly stopped at my bed accompanied by her guru , an elderly man from India who had eyes like crystals themselves . It was part of their charity work to visit the infirm and give sick people hope . Right from the start , I felt something about him , some inner strength that he was able to share with me , instill in me . He taught me how to meditate and opened the doors to my new self . I dedicated my first poem to him . He has since gone back to India . That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holly came to me and offered me a job in her shop and I agreed . I 've been here ever since . " Let 's see , " he said , flipping the pages . " Ah , yes . This was when I first began to write poems . I was n't working here long . I had read some poetry in this Village newspaper and thought I would like to try putting my thoughts down , too . Want to hear it ? " " Very much , please . " He stared at the pages for a long , silent moment and then in a very soft , low voice , read . " I had come to the end of daylight and faced the doorway of darkness . But when I touched my face , I realized my eyes were closed and my skin was cold . All that I thought I loved and needed was gone and I was naked , shivering in misery . They were measuring me for a coffin . Suddenly , I heard a voice calling from within myself I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to look deep and I saw a single candle . It drew me closer until I could reach out and put my fingers in the flame . Slowly , meticulously , I burned away my dead body and when it was gone , I was no longer naked . " He looked up slowly . " It 's beautiful , " I said , " but I 'm not sure I understand . " " I had to crawl out of my old , now crippled body , burn it away because it literally imprisoned me . Once I found the inner light , true spirituality , I was able to go beyond the physical body and reach a higher place . Someday , you will too . Everything you love and think you need looks lost . You 're on a search because you feel naked , without meaning or hope ; but you 'll see that you have everything you need inside yourself and you did n't have to take a single step in any direction . " I said nothing . We gazed at each other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got that look in your eyes again . You think I 'm a kook again . " " No , " I said , laughing . " Actually , I hope what you say is true . " " It is , but these are discoveries everyone has to make for himself or herself . I can only show you the way , point you in a direction . " " Is that why Holly called you the best guide in the galaxy ? " " Yes , " he said with a laugh . " All right , enough lessons for one evening . Want to go for a walk ? " " A walk ? " He laughed at my surprise . " Well , you 'll walk and push me along , " he said . " Oh . Sure , " I said , hoping I had n't insulted him with my astonishment . " It 's pretty warm out . You do n't need a jacket . " Without any hesitation , he turned his chair around and wheeled himself out of the living room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost had to run to keep up . We paused outside the door for him to lock it and then he , asked me to push him up the street . At the corner , we crossed and went down another street , past the shops , a few restaurants and a small theater . The sidewalks were crowded with well-dressed people , and I enjoyed seeing their glamorous hustle-and-bustle lifestyle . When we reached the N.Y.U. campus , Billy had me pause to listen to some speakers . Some were making political speeches , others were ranting about the coming of the end of the world . At one corner a man played a guitar and sang folk songs to a small group that had gathered around him . He had his hat before him and people were putting in change and dollars . Farther down , a group of young men sang spiritual songs a cappella . They were very good and they , too , had a basket out for contributions . " What do you think ? " Billy asked me as we moved down the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing with a tree , and a black boy who looked like he could n't be more than twelve playing the bongo drums . " Now I understand why Holly calls New York a carnival of life . " Billy laughed and asked me to wheel him toward a bench where there were no people and little noise . I sat and we watched the traffic , the groups of tourists and city dwellers making their way to and from their destinations . " It was on this corner , " he suddenly said . " What was ? " " Where it happened . I was running in that direction , " he nodded to the left . " It was about two in the morning . I was a student here , you know . " " Oh . Does n't it bother you to come here ? " " No . It intrigues me . I can give you this advice , Melody Logan , " he said in a deeper , darker voice that made my spine tingle . " Seize the moment , confront the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way out . Do n't let anything shut you up inside yourself . Wherever you go , whatever you see , when you are most afraid , think of this corner , of those shadows , of me sitting here and staring back through time at myself , at the gunman , at the sound of the pistol , at myself folding on that sidewalk and then , suddenly rising up out of myself and standing taller than before . " He reached out and took my hand and I felt as if his courage and spiritual strength moved into me . I smiled . " Thank you , Billy . " " Thank yourself , cherish yourself and do n't let anyone make you feel small . " He sat back and suddenly looked exhausted , as if he had spent all his energy on me . " Maybe we should go back now , " I suggested . He nodded . Holly still had n't returned by the time we arrived . " Can I help you with anything ? " I asked . " I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Billy wheeled himself down the corridor , first to the bathroom and then to his room . I prepared for bed myself . As he went by to go to his room , he paused at my door . " Good night , Melody . " " Good night , Billy , " I called . He wheeled into his room and I marveled at how cheerful he was and how well he had driven the shadows of loneliness from his door . I was n't in my room five minutes before those shadows began closing in on me . Here I was in a strange place , away from anyone I loved or who loved me , feeling like a wanderer who had lost all sense of direction and no longer knew her way home . From what well of faith did Billy Maxwell draw so much strength ? I lay there in the dark thinking about Cary , hearing his laughter , recalling flashes of his smile , his beguiling eyes , even his smirk . Thinking about him made me feel better . I closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ocean , visualized the sight of the tide rushing in to wash the shore . And soon , the shadows of loneliness sunk back . Sleep , like the tide , washed over me . I was drifting out . When I woke the next morning , I was embarrassed by how late I had slept . I practically jumped out of the bed , washed and dressed . Holly and Billy had already opened the shop and were dealing with customers . " I 'm sorry I slept so late , " I declared when the customers left . " That 's all right , honey , " Holly said . " You must have been exhausted . Billy told me you two went for a walk , " she added . " I guess all the excitement of being in New York tired me out . " " I 'll get her some breakfast , " Billy called out as he headed for the kitchen . " I hate being so much trouble . " " You 're no trouble . After you have some breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Then , I 'd like to show you some of New York . What would you like to see the most ? " " I do n't know . " My mind reeled with the possibilities , the things and places I had only read about and Alice and I had spoken about back in Sewell when the two of us planned a future trip together . What had once been a childhood fantasy was now a reality for me . " I guess I 'd like to see the Empire State Building and Broadway and the Statue of Liberty and the Museum of Natural History and ... " " There 's only one day , " Holly said , laughing . " I 'll show her most of that , " Billy called from the kitchen . " Got some fruit , a bowl of multi-grain cereal , juice and coffee in here waiting on you , Melody . " " You 'll show me ? " I asked , not hiding my astonishment well . He and Holly looked at each other and then laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holly said . " He has a van with a lift and a specially engineered steering wheel . " " Gift from my parents , " he said , and I thought , how strange that he had never mentioned them before . " I ca n't take you away from the shop . I ... " " What do you mean ? I 'm due a vacation anyway , are n't I , Holly ? " " More than one , " Holly replied . " Better eat breakfast so you can get started , " Holly said . " Go on , " she urged . " Stop being a worrywart . " I laughed and went in to have my breakfast . Afterward , Holly and I drove over to the travel agency where her friend worked and I picked up my airline tickets . Having them in my hand with the itinerary spelled out before me made me suddenly frightened . Would I really get on that plane tomorrow and fly across the country to stay with people I did n't know and search one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see me ? Billy had his van in front of the shop when we returned . He showed me how the lift worked and then took his place in the driver 's seat . Holly waved good-bye as we drove off for my tour of New York , Billy looking as excited about it as I was . " It 's always fun to see familiar things through virgin eyes , " he explained . " It helps one appreciate what one has more . " Seeing the Empire State Building in the distance was one thing , but to ride right up to it and look up was another . " You want to go up ? " Billy asked . " Can we ? " " Of course . I 'll pull into that parking garage there and we 'll take the elevator . It 's a beautiful day for it . We 'll probably see into Canada . " " We will ? " " No , " he said laughing . " You probably think I 'm a country bumpkin , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ? It would be refreshing and honest , " he replied . Billy could turn anything negative into a positive , I thought . How could anyone be so perfect ? Billy moved about the city as if it were just a small town no bigger than Sewell . The hordes of people , a veritable sea of bodies and faces moving up and down the sidewalks , the legions of cars , the noise and commotion seemed not to exist . He wheeled himself along barely noticing any of it , while my eyes raced back and forth , up and down , taking in everything . The elevator ride to the observation deck of the Empire State Building was the most exciting I had ever taken , and when we stepped out and over to the railing , I thought we were literally on top of the world . I squealed with amazement . Billy laughed and gave me some change for the telescope through which I could see the Hudson River and clear across to New Jersey . Afterward , we drove up to Broadway and past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Times Square , a place I had seen only on television and read about in books . My heart pounded with excitement . I could n't wait to write to Alice . Billy decided we should have lunch in the world famous Chinatown , where he could get his favorite  --  vegetable lo mein . While we were there , he bought me a beautiful hand-painted fan . After lunch , we went out to the Statue of Liberty . The sky was still mostly blue and there was a warm breeze from New York Harbor . When we returned to shore , I realized Billy was more tired than he pretended and I told him it was time to go back to the shop , claiming I was tired myself . I was n't . New York had a way of injecting its energy into me . The panorama of people , things to see and do was mesmerizing and helped me forget all my worries and troubles . Back at the shop , the three of us sat and had some tea while I ranted on and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Billy went into his room to meditate and Holly and I took care of the customers . I was fascinated with how much people were intrigued by her crystals and gems , how much they wanted to believe in the powers . All sorts of people came in to buy and inquire about the items : old as well as young , men and women alike . Some were frequent customers and many testified to the claims Holly made about her stones . When Billy emerged from his room , he looked revived . Once again I offered to help him with dinner , but again he told me I was the guest and he enjoyed the preparations . After she closed the shop , Holly and I sat in the living room and relaxed while Billy made dinner . I told her about the poem he had read and the things he had said . " He 's a wonderful person . I 'm happy he became my partner . " " He said his parents gave him the van , but he did n't mention any more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holly grimaced . " They live upstate and they are quite happy he 's not there , too . They do n't accept his way of life now . His father calls him a hippie . " " Oh , how sad . " " Billy is n't happy about it , but he 's resigned and he accepts it . " " Does he have any brothers and sisters ? " " An older brother , an attorney . He sees him whenever he comes to New York ; or , I should say , once in a while when he comes to New York . I do n't think he calls every time . He wanted Billy to go home and live with their parents , but Billy wo n't be treated like some handicapped person , as you 've probably already noticed . " " He 's amazing , " I said . " Inspirational . " Holly nodded . Then she turned a bit serious . " I 've been working on your charts , Melody , " she said . " Now that I know more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , I can get a clearer picture . " " And ? " " I do n't think you 're going to find what you want , " she said gently . " Maybe you should turn around and return to the life you have , the people you know you can count on . " It was like a clap of thunder above my head . I sucked in my breath and smiled . " You know I ca n't , " I said softly and she nodded . " But after being with Billy and learning from him , I 'm not as afraid as I was . " " That 's good . " " I 'm very grateful to you for what you 've done for me . I do n't know if I would have had the courage to do this if it were n't for you , Holly . Thank you . " She did n't smile . " I hope I 've done the right thing , " she said . I could only wonder what it was she saw in the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought , not to ask .
