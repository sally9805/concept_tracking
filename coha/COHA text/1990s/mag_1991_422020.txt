<p> Take a 24-acre marsh impounded in 1964 to create a wildlife refuge , a dream , a great imagination , lumber from a sawmill that serves a state forest in the western part of the state and a lot of hard work , and what do you get ? One of the state 's most attractive nature trails , complete with four sections of boardwalk that permit young and old alike to venture out into the watery realm of the marsh . If you add to this trails connecting the boardwalks , you have a marvelous route that traverses scrub stands of farmer 's fields returning to forests , knolls with hardwood such as maples and beech and groves of towering hemlock . The trail is a time-line through areas that demonstrate the forest succession typical of the southern fringes of the Adirondacks . <p> The story of Willie Marsh is a success story for DEC 's efforts in education and recreation . It began when the marsh was created to support migratory birds and ducks . A dam , built with federal funds created the marsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adirondacks , just northwest of Gloversville . The dam impounded water , flooding trees whose stark cavities are now home to tree swallows and cedar waxwings . The large area of shallow water supports food and cover , not only for migrating ducks , but for breeding wood ducks as well . <p> In the early 1980s , Jack Harnish , a wildlife specialist from DEC 's Warrensburg office , realized the potential of the marsh . His story reads like the children 's tale of the little red hen , who plowed the fields , sowed the wheat , harvested and took it to be ground and baked the bread  --  and it was not until the bread was . finished that helpers came along to enjoy the efforts . Harnish had a few helpers along the way , but not many , and the shortage of help accounts for the fact it took the better part of a decade to finish the trail . <p> When he started , his superiors liked the idea , but there were not enough funds .

Their work began in 1986 , but they could only spend time on it when their other responsibilities were out of the way . Finally , the division of operations found treated lumber at a sawmill that serves a state forest . <p> In 1987 they drew the marsh down , letting out the impounded water so they could build the boardwalks . First they built bunkers to support the boardwalks . The bunkers are cribs made of rocks and logs . A curving chain of 14 bunkers , spaced 20 feet apart , connects shore with an island covered with tall hemlocks . A second boardwalk reaches the far shore at the narrows of the marsh . <p> Later , the planking that made the deck of the boardwalks was added . The next year the boardwalk was finished and the railings were added . In 1989 , they fine-tuned the trail and added signs . DEC built a small parking area at the trailhead , which is 1.8 miles west of NY 29A on Willie Road . An old road across from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attractive wooden sign that shows the trails , which begin downslope , to the right of the booth . <p> The trails are laid out in a figure eight , so that walkers proceed in one direction , minimizing contact with other people . The yellow trail is a short loop that starts in scrub forests and leads over the springy sphagnum base of the border of the marsh . It enters a deep forest , then traverses the long boardwalk , the island and a second boardwalk , before turning back to the beginning . The red trail forks left at the end of the second boardwalk . This much longer loop reaches the deepest forests , then crosses the causeway that dams the marsh and returns via two more stretches of boardwalk to the crossing of the figure eight at the long boardwalk . <p> Numbers along the route correspond to zones in the trail , which are described in a pamphlet . The numbers emphasize such sights as signs of past settlements or the beaver houses that dot the marsh .

The student is urged to stop and listen , to learn to observe signs of animals , to look at water plants and animals . <p> The trail was fully complete in early 1990 , and the first time I walked it , in the spring of that year , I was impressed by its potential as a bird walk . I liked the way it took you through a sphagnum bog with its particular variety of shrubs , ferns and groundcovers . Best of all was the walk across the open water , which made it so easy to observe the wooded edges of the marsh . I marveled at the number of birds perched close by on the stumps and snags beside the boardwalk , I counted the songs of at least eight warblers , even if I did not see them all , and I thrilled to the soaring antics of a red-shouldered hawk . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to take their young children on a nature walk and we have returned many times . <p> The little girls marveled at the water bugs below the boardwalk . A heron stood starkly still in the tall grass , then took off , only to land in a nearby tree . On the way in , one girl found the wings of a luna moth , the remains of some bird 's feast . We sampled winter-green and identified a dozen different ferns . We have seen beaver and deer and have looked for the otter and muskrat that are known to inhabit the banks of the marsh . We have counted butterflies , especially the red admirals that flutter over the colorful blossoms . <p> The children preferred a late summer walk when they could taste blackberries and count and look up the names of the wonderful variety of colorful mushrooms . The oranges , reds , purples and browns were matched with the guide we brought along . They delighted in the red efts that crawled across the trail . Even the littlest child tried using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of times and plan to go back as the seasons change . The view from the boardwalk is always fresh and different and there is always something new to see . <p> Others from DEC who helped with the trail are Anita Sanchez of the Five Rivers Environmental Education Center , wildlife biologists Gary Hill , Dave Kenyon and Randy Stumvoll as well as Don Decker of operations now retired . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The long boardwalk at Willie Marsh <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ( Above ) A perfect place for children to take a nature walk <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ( Right ) Along the short boardwalk <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Pausing to inspect a mushroom <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ( Above ) The walk across the water makes it easy to observe the wooded edges of the marsh as well as the life to be found in the marsh itself . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ( Left ) The young lady gets a hands-on experience of a red eft . <p> by Barbara McMartin <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them guides to Adirondack trails that invite the hiker to discover new adventures .
