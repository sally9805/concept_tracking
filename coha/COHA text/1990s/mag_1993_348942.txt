Once a sturdy ally of Boris Yeltsin 's , Ruslan Khasbulatov has turned into one of his most implacable foes . Last week the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet talked candidly with TIME about the failures of reform , the growing anti- American sentiment in his country and why Yeltsin should quit . <P> Q. What do you think will be the outcome of the April 25 referendum ? <P> A. I really do n't care . Any outcome will only be a loss for Russia . The referendum is needed by the Yeltsin team to deflect the people 's attention from real failures in the economy . This is in the tradition of our Communist Party bureaucracy . Whenever things went wrong , they tried to distract attention , as in ancient Rome , by providing bread and circuses . <P> Q. What is your message for the Russian people during this campaign ? <P> A. I would like Russians to think over one question : During the past three years of this economic policy , has your life become better or worse ? I want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying out reform in a more successful fashion . It is no secret to anyone today that the President is not up to his job and keeps violating the constitution and the laws . He has reverted to the kind of activity that comes natural to him  --  being the first secretary of a regional Communist Party committee . But life is not going to end on April 25 . It will be only the beginning of a more serious life . <P> Q. You were once Yeltsin 's right-hand man in parliament . What went wrong ? <P> A. As the President himself said  --  and I agree with him  --  this is not a question of personalities . At issue are different approaches to economic reform . ( ( The President 's team ) ) has failed , humiliated the entire country . But Yeltsin stubbornly keeps going on . Can a huge state be held hostage to this kind of stubbornness ? When you are driving a car and see a concrete wall up ahead , you have to put on the brakes . Maybe if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are taking the whole country along , you have to be more reasonable . <P> Q. You have said the West pays too much attention to Yeltsin , but is there an alternative ? <P> A. There are 150 million Russians , and you say there is no alternative ! Why do n't you like Vice President Rutskoi ? What about the Prime Minister or any of the deputies or regional governors ? For Russian citizens , it does n't really make any difference if Clinton supports Yeltsin or not . Quite the contrary . It only irritates them . It is only natural , they think , that the former enemies of Russia would approve of Yeltsin , because he is the one who ruined the country . I am really concerned about a growth of anti-American feeling . You have fallen into this artificial trap out of a sheer lack of knowledge of Russia . <P> Q. So how does Russia solve its crisis ? <P> A. I told our esteemed President , " You have lost your authority , and through your efforts and the efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also lost their authority . So let 's go for early elections  --  together . " The President and I have reached agreements before . We embrace each other , then we leave with the understanding that we have resolved the issue . The next day he rejects it . This is not the way I am used to working . <P> Q. Is there a danger that if the power struggle continues , there might be a restoration of communist power ?
