<p> ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER , CHRISTOPHER HAMPTON AND DON BLACK : Sunset Boulevard ( American premiere recording with Glenn Close ) <p> Polydor , $ 29.99 <p> FOUR STARS <p> . <p> ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER , CHRISTOPHER HAMPTON AND DON BLACK : Sunset Boulevard ( World premiere recording with Patti LuPone ) Polydor , $ 29.99 <p> THREE STARS <p> When it comes to Andrew Lloyd Webber 's latest musical , the backstage intrigue on both sides of the Atlantic makes all the batty doings at Norma Desmond 's mansion at 10086 Sunset Boulevard seem sane . <p> Maybe if Michele Lee had said yes to the role of Norma , the Los Angeles production would still be running and Faye Dunaway 's career would not have been wrecked again . If Dunaway had worked out , we might have heard Rex Smith opposite her as Joe Gillis . Who knows , La Streisand might still do the movie . <p> As it is , the best sung version of this actually pretty fabulous score may well be the one without the hoopla : Betty Buckley is onstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightening opposite the ideal Gillis of John Barrowman . Perhaps the lyrics proclaim the truth when Gillis sings that " the world is full of Joes and Normas . " <p> And in the meantime , we have not one but two complete recordings , with Patti LuPone 's controversial original Norma in the world premiere recording competing with the revised role as sung by Glenn Close in the American premiere CD , including the new high-voltage finale that by now has been inserted into the London production . The choice is tough , frankly . <p> One thing is clear : LuPone has the vocal equipment for the demanding music , and she makes it her own from the first phrase . She is one of the musical world 's few real stars and it is a thrill to hear her follow her unforgettable Evita , Fantine , Nancy and Reno Sweeney with the formidable Norma Desmond . <p> Still  --  and even without taking into account her youthful presence onstage  --  she sounds too young for the part . This is not a matter of age , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name two other Broadway divas , also are blessed with timbres that will sound young always , but both have managed to work with that sound to create characters of all ages . LuPone ca n't . Her accent , of all things , also grates on repeated hearings and comes off like a Berlitz version of Old Hollywood . <p> Close , who does not have anywhere near LuPone 's musical talent , is more successful in making sense of the score . One example among many in the recordings is what amounts to a call to service from Norma to her young stud , as the aging actress tells him " Now let 's go upstairs . " With LuPone , the scene is steamy , the lady downright seductive . Listening to Close , on the other hand , is scary . She is a crazed predator on the edge , and that is what the role needs if the murder at the end is to mean anything more than a tabloid headline . <p> When LuPone 's Norma says that " Without me , there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag ; with Close , the listener believes both Norma and her madness . True , the gears are exposed and often raw in Close 's vocals , with little to join her fragile fake soprano and the gutsier low notes . <p> Still , she is a compromise worth making . And she is in fine company . The American cast is uniformly more satisfying , not least in getting the accents right . Both Judy Kuhn and George Hearn are way ahead of their British competition , and the American recording also features better dramatic continuity . Kevin Anderson is a fine Gillis to LuPone 's Norma , but Alan Campbell is sexier and more complex . <p> The show itself does not come up to the level of the underrated " Aspects of Love , " but it is nevertheless among the composer 's finest creations . No one this side of George Gershwin sets English words to music as naturally as Lloyd Webber , and the breathless excitement of the scenes in the Paramount back lot alone would make this an extraordinary musical . <p> Rhythmically it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misses the wit of Tim Rice 's lyrics in earlier Lloyd Webber shows . Don Black 's doggerel can sabotage the emotional impact of a potentially great scene , with the worst example falling on poor Max , Norma 's first husband . After a touching , inventive song when the old man tells Gillis that he should have seen Norma " when her dreams were young , " the lyrics force a resolution into a 4/4 ditty not unlike Morrissey 's " Girlfriend in a Coma " as Max sings " she never knew the meaning of surrender " and the whole scene descends to the school-play level of " Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat . " <p> One gets the feeling that the composer does n't know just how good his own music can be . Yet there is enough here to make " Sunset Boulevard " fascinating . Dyed-in-the-wool Lloyd Webber fans doubtless will want both recorded versions . But the best bet is to enjoy the complete recording with Close and hope for highlights with LuPone . <p> * Octavio Roca <p> . <p> * ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WARREN CASEY : Grease ! ( 1994 Broadway cast recording ) <p> RCA Victor , $ 14.99 <p> ONE STAR <p> The world was n't exactly clamoring for a new version of this self-consciously nostalgic musical , but this year has seen two major revivals in London and New York , with a road version of the New York production due in San Francisco later this season . <p> It looked good on paper , but Jeff Calhoun 's Broadway revival of " Grease ! " ended up being a mess on stage and not much better on disc . The best recorded version available of the musical now , frankly , is the pairing of John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John on the film , out on home video and featuring the bonus of Bee Gees songs added to the original Broadway score . <p> The London revival , still going strong in the West End and well worth seeking out on CD in the import bins , used the movie music , too , and boasts a strong cast . The New York revival was not allowed to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950s . It did n't help . <p> The talented Ricky Paul Goldin can do almost anything , but singing is not his strong suit and his Danny Zuko is a dud . Even more disappointing is Rosie O'Donnell , who looks too old to play Betty Rizzo onstage and sounds too off- pitch to pull it off in the studio . ( Maureen McCormick , Marcia of TV 's " Brady Bunch , " has been playing Rizzo since October 7 ; Brooke Shields , also cast against type , takes over the role around Thanksgiving . ) <p> The rest of the cast goes through the motions of being cool , but the sound is overproduced and the singing underdone . One surprise is Sam Harris , a " Star Search " winner and possibly the best Doody ever . Maybe he 'll include some of this music in his forthcoming solo disc . <p> * O.

At first , Michael LaChiusa 's music sounds like watered-down Sondheim , with much of the score composed of setups for songs that never arrive . But the sound world is alluring and soon the sung narrative grows irresistible . <p> " I 've Got a Little Itch " with its jazzy syncopation alone is worth the disc , and " The Young Thing and the Writer " is one of the hottest  --  and sweetest  --  seduction scenes on record . The cast is wonderful . <p> Donna Murphy sounds disconcertingly like a young Liza Minelli , John Dossett is still one of Broadway 's best-kept secrets and John Cameron Mitchell only grows stronger with each new role . If " Hello Again " had opened as a new American opera , it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway , but we are disappointed too often . This modest musical delivers . <p> * O.

Gwen Verdon and a youngster named Bob Fosse came together in these two musicals that are now available for the first time on compact disc . <p> " New Girl in Town " is an improbable adaptation of Eugene O'Neill 's " Anna Christie , " and " Redhead " is a showcase for the very redheaded Verdon . She is in delicious form , less mannered than in the better-known " Damn Yankees " and seductive as ever . " Redhead " ( 1959 ) in particular is welcome for " I Feel Merely Marvelous , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revelation in Verdon 's ragamuffin voice . <p> * O. Roca
