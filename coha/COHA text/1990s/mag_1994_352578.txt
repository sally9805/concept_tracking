It was nearly dusk on a recent evening when a U.S. Special Forces team walked into a village northeast of Port-au-Prince and encountered a problem for which their training manuals had not prepared them . Several mothers were convinced that a pair of werewolves , in the form of two local women , had placed a curse on the village children and were now preparing to consume their babies ' souls . As he listened , the team 's warrant officer tucked his hand into his pocket , snapped open a chemical light stick that soldiers use as markers at night and announced in Creole that he would break the curse . Mumbling incantations , the officer anointed each child 's forehead with a smear of the glowing green liquid . After declaring " the spell has been lifted , " he turned to the stunned werewolves and promised that if they ever pulled such a stunt again , he would put a spell on them : his magic was much more powerful than theirs . <P> The 9,000 American soldiers still stationed in Haiti have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of Port-au-Prince , which belongs to conventional soldiers who patrol the streets , keep the peace and bide their time until they are scheduled to return home . The second world belongs to the 1,200 men of the Special Forces who , since the occupation began , have overseen rural Haiti . Taking on the roles of sheriff , prosecutor , judge , plumber , mayor and ghostbuster , these commandos are often the only glue holding together the 5 million Haitians who live outside the capital . <P> From their headquarters in a former brassiere factory in Port-au-Prince , the Green Berets have fanned out to more than 500 villages . Upon arriving , they have often been forced to refashion local government after the soldiers and strongmen who terrorized the area faded away like zombies in the night , leaving behind a brutalized population . In Mirebalais , the prodemocracy deputy mayor was beheaded and his body thrown into a nearby river . At the prison in Les Cayes , inmates were treated so abominably that one man 's spine was visible through the lesions on his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commandos ' evenhanded approach has often opened them to the charge of collaborating with the henchmen of the old regime . Yet they have also displayed a rare talent for getting things done , from powering up old electric plants and water pumps to installing mayors , protecting judges and delivering babies . Often nine men will control a town of 20,000 people . " We 're not nation builders , " said a Green Beret , " but we 're trying to be helpful , and the people really seem to appreciate whatever we do . " <P> Their tactics , often devised on the spot , have been unusual , to say the least . To clear the streets of thugs , Green Berets on patrol took to inverting their night-vision goggles so that they glowed in the dark . In Les Cayes , the Special Forces jailed a judge overnight to teach him how inhumane prison conditions were . They have also moved aggressively to arrest anyone they thought might be a bad guy . " We detained them . We cuffed them , " acknowledges the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this without a whole lot of proof . But it was a very visible symbol of our presence . It convinced the people we were there to help them . " For Haitians traumatized by generations of dictatorship , the Americans ' unconventional tactics carry a most welcome and powerful magic .
