Mike Resnick 's most recent novel is Kirinyaga , the long-awaited assemblage of all his stories about the attempt to establish a Kenyan utopia in space . By the time you read this , however , his most recent novel may MR be A Hunger in the Soul , which is due out shortly . And if you 're getting to this issue a bit late-around August , say-his most recent novel is The Widowmaker Unleashed . It has been some time since we visited the offices of the Mallory s Carruthers Agency . You 'll soon see that the situation there ( as usual ) is as madcap as ever . <p> INNIFRED CARRUTHERS , a frown on her pink , pudgy face , placed some cards on a table . " The March Hare , the Mad Hatter , the White Rabbit , the Cheshire Cat , and the Star , " she announced . Mallory , seated at his desk , his feet balanced atop a ouija board , never looked up from the Racing Form that he and the magic mirror behind him were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John Justin ? " she persisted . " It sounds like the answer to : Name a lousy poker hand , " " replied Mallory in a bored voice . He held up the Form . " There are more important things to consider Flyaway 's running again tomorrow . " " Has n't he lost thirty-eight races in a row ? " asked Winnifred . " Forty-one , " corrected the magic mirror . " I 'd say he 's due to win one , would n't you ? " replied Mallory . " I 'd go with the string , " said the mirror . " So would I , " said Winnifred . " He 's remarkably consistent . " Mallory shrugged . " It 's a battle of wills . Someday that nag is going to win , and after betting him thirty-three straight races , I 'm not going to be left behind when he does . " " Leaving things behind - like other racehorses  --  does n't seem to be his forte , " noted Winnifred . " Oh , ye of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to figure out if tomorrow is the day he turns it around , and you 're nagging me about poker hands . " " Not poker hands , " Winnifred corrected him . " Cards . " " Same thing . " " Not quite . " She held one of the cards up . " They arrived in the mail , addressed to the Mallory 8t Carruthers Detective Agency . I think you 'll find this one interesting . " " You 're not going to leave me alone until I look at it , right ? " " Right , John Justin . " " Okay , toss it over . " Winnifred gave him a withering look and flipped the card toward him with a flick of her wrist . It was halfway across the room when a decidedly feminine figure leaped through the air and grabbed it in her mouth . " It 's only paper , " complained the figure , spitting out the card disgustedly . " Let me guess  --  you 're hungry , " said Mallory . " She 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault that cat people have high metabolisms r " asked the cat person . " Besides , I like to catch things . " She purred . " Especially if they wriggle . " " You 're all heart , Felina , " said Mallory . " Now bring me the damned thing before I lose my patience . " " You 're all heart , Felina , " said Mallory . " Now bring me the damned thing before I lose my patience . " " Doctors lose their patients , " said Felina . " What you lose are clients . " " I 'm delighted to see that no one will ever accuse you of the twin vices of loyalty and humor , " said Mallory . " Now , the card , if you please ? " Felina picked it up and leaped onto the top of Mallory 's chair . " Here you are , " she said , leaning forward over his head and handing the card to him . He studied it for a long moment , then looked at Winnifred . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You tell me . " " I have no idea . What the hell is my photograph doing on a card ? And how come there 's no suit ? And is a star higher or lower than an ace ? " " It 's a tarot card , John Justin . " He frowned . " Do you believe in that mumbo-jumbo ? " " Certainly . " " Me , too , " said Felina and the mirror in unison . " Rubbish , " said Mallory . " You must remember you 're not in your Manhattan any more , John Justin , " said Winnifred . " In a city with gorgons , leprechauns , unicorns , chimeras , magi , and the Grundy himself , why should you disbelieve in tarot ? " Mallory shrugged . " A man 's got to disbelieve in something , " he said . " It gives his life meaning . " He paused and smiled . " I read that in a book I no longer believe in . " " Sometimes I do n't understand you at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same problem , " replied Mallory wryly . " I understand you , " said Felina from somewhere behind his head . " You do ? " " You 're a man . The God Of All Cats put you here to feed me and scratch between my shoulder blades . " " How comforting to know I 've been endowed with such a noble purpose . " " Oh , it 's not noble , " explained Felina . " You ca n't help yourself . " " So much for free will , " said Mallory . He looked at the card again . " Along with wondering who made the card , what made them assume I 'm a star ? I 'm an underpaid detective with a partner and a ninety-two-pound office cat that looks kind of like Melanie Griffith before her morning shave . " " There 's a better question than that , John Justin , " said Winnifred . " I 'll bet there are dozens of better questions . Which one is yours ? " " Why was it sent to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " answered Mallory . " Maybe it 's a sample , and someone will call to see if I want to pay for a whole deck . " " Maybe , " said Winnifred dubiously . " But if it was an advertising solicitation , there should have been some information with it , like who to contact and how much it will cost . " " Maybe it 's Hollywood calling , and they finally figured out that I could be a star . " The mirror giggled. , Then Felina started chuckling , more and more rapidly , louder and louder , until she finally fell off the chair and rolled across the floor , laughing hysterically . " All right , all right , so maybe I 'm not the next Clint Eastwood . It 's not that damned funny . " " Sure it is ! " gasped Felina . " I could really get into the part of Tarzan stabbing his knife into Sabor the Lioness 's ribcage a couple of dozen times , " muttered Mallory bitterly . " We 're getting away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't aware that there was one . " " The tarot card . " " I do n't know anything about tarot cards . Do you ? " " No , not really . " " Then let 's not worry about it . " " All right , " said Winnifred . " But ... " " But what ? " " When I was a white hunter , I did n't know anything about cholera or yellow fever - but I made sure my inoculations were up to date . " " You tell me how to inoculate myself against a tarot card and we 'll talk , " said Mallory , picking up the Form again . " In the meantime , let me concentrate on inoculating Flyaway against a muddy track . " " And anything faster than a turtle , " added Felina . FLYAWAY 'S RACE was its usual model of consistency . He broke last in a field of nine , was ninth into the clubhouse turn , ninth down the backstretch , ninth going around the far turn , ninth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go broke betting against Seattle Slew and Swaps and Tim Tam , " muttered Mallory , tearing up his tickets . " But I hear a name like Flyaway , and I just know this is a runner , this is a horse who was meant to pierce a hole in the wind . " He stared balefully at the lathered animal as it was led off the track and back to the barn . " When I catch the bastard who named you , there wo n't be enough of him left to bury . " He decided not to watch the remaining races , since he had no betting interests , and instead took the subway back home . The car he entered was crowded , and he found himself standing next to a pair of sailors . One of them had his eyes shut and a pained expression on his face . The other patted him on the back occasionally , as if to encourage him . " I do n't mean to intrude , " said Mallory at last , " but your friend seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just trying to remember the Maine , " came the answer . " It 's his patriotic nature . " " What happens when he remembers it ? " asked Mallory curiously . " Oh , then he goes to work remembering the Indianapolis and the Bismark . Of course , " added the sailor , " when he remembers the Bismark , he hates the British for up to five minutes before returning to his senses . Then he goes back to hating the dirty Viet Cong- or whoever 's dirty this time . " Suddenly the first sailor opened his eyes . " Do you suppose Noah had any torpedoes on the ark ? " " Seems unlikely , " offered Mallory . " Okay , thanks , " he said , and promptly closed his eyes again , lost in concentration . " What does he do when he 's not remembering sunken warships ? " asked Mallory . " Oh , he kills the enemy , and goes to the movies a lot . " " A nice parley . " " Especially propaganda movies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " That 's where we 're going tonight . " Mallory looked up . " ' A revival of that all-time favorite , Brazzaville , starring Humphrey Bogart , Ingrid Bergman , and Claude Rains , " " he read . " It 's our favorite . " Mallory blinked his eyes . " How can it be ? They never made it . " " What are you talking about ? " demanded the sailor . " It 's probably the most popular film in history . " " They wanted to make a sequel to Casablanca , but they never got an acceptable script . " " Casablanca ? " repeated the sailor . " That piece of shit ? " It 's a great film , " insisted Mallory . " It might have been , if it did n't have Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan in the leads , " answered the sailor . " Maybe if they 'd used Bogart and Bergman and the rest of the Brazzaville cast .... " Mallory grimaced and cursed under his breath . " Damn ! Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something always brings home the fact that I 'm not in Kansas anymore . " The sailor chuckled . " I like your sense of humor . And I see you know your movies . " " I beg your pardon ? " " That line , " continued the sailor . " A delightful inversion of the famed " We 're not in Oz anymore , " from The Wizard of Kansas . " " That 's me , " said Mallory . " A bundle of laughs . " " The Andrea Doreal " cried the first sailor suddenly . " Does n't count , " said his companion . " Not a war tragedy . " " Damn ! " said the first sailor , slamming his fist against the wall of the train - and inadvertently hitting the emergency stop cord . The train screeched to a halt . The two sailors stumbled into Mallory , who bounced off the wall . Suddenly he looked up and saw that he had jarred the Brazzaville poster and frame loose , and that they were falling toward his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , deflecting the frame , and an instant later his head poked up through the poster , right beneath Bogart 's hat . When he related his adventure to Winnifred back at the office , he was prepared for sympathy or even disbelief - but not for the reaction he received . al " Now do you believe ? " she demanded . " In Brazzavi/le ? " he asked , confused . " In tarot cards. , " Of course not . Why ? " " Because you received a tarot with you as the star , and suddenly you were almost killed by the poster of a star . " " I 'd call that line of reasoning just a bit far-fetched , " replied Mallory . " It was a fluke . An accident . No one could have predicted that this guy would hit the emergency cord like that . " " Tarot predicted it . " " Bah , humbug , and rubbish , " said Mallory . " You think so ? " said Winnifred . " Then look at this . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? , " A tarot card . Someone slid it under the door while you were at the races . " Mallory walked over , took the card from his gray-haired partner , and examined it . " That 's a picture of me on a gallows with a noose around my neck , " he noted . " The Hanged Man . " " The what ? " " The Hanged Man , " repeated Winnifred . " It 's a tarot card . " She stared at him . " Now are you going to start taking all this seriously ? " " It 's some kind of prank . " " It 's a warning . " " From who ? About what ? " Mallory tossed the card down onto a table . " Flyaway will win by ten lengths before anyone ever puts a noose around my neck . " " I hope you 're right , John Justin , " said Winnifred dubiously . " Of course I am , " said Mallory , walking to the closet and getting his battered fedora . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I did n't know you 'd taken up horticulture , John Justin , " said Winnifred with a smile of approval . " Madison Square Garden , " said Mallory . " A prizefight ? " she asked distastefully . " Basketball game . Gremlins versus the Goblins . " " Be careful . " " Okay , I promise not to foul anyone over seven feet tall , " said Mallory , walking out the door . The crowd at the Garden was in a baleful mood . The Gremlins were down 66-37 at the half , which was hardly surprising , since some oldtimers swore the Gremlins had n't won a game since Teddy Roosevelt charged up San juan Hill . One historian disagreed , claiming that San Juan Hill had marked the halfway point of their current losing streak . Mean Marvin McCoy was the Gremlins " 108th coach since the streak began , and it looked like he was n't going to fare any better than his predecessors . Based on the record , it was hardly his fault , but the crowd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team and most of the spectators were gremlins , it was n't a difficult call . Let it be said that Mean Marvin was n't a gracious loser . He spat on his center during a time-out . He put a cigarette out on the back of his point guard 's neck . He refused to let his power forward have a drink . When he saw two of his reserves looking too comfortable on the bench , he threw a chair at them . He screamed at the referee , cursed at the public address announcer , and bit a 72-year-old woman on the knee when she cheered after a Goblin basket . He set fire to a child who ran up and asked for an autograph . When one of his players was called for a careless foul , Marvin ripped off his coat , shirt and pants and began stomping on them in mute fury . Earlyin the fourth quarter , the crowd began chanting , " Kill the coach ! Kill the coach ! Slice him and dice him , tromp him and stomp him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might as well leave , since the Gremlins were losing 133 to 58 with less than seven minutes to play , but as he got to his feet the crowd surged forward toward the court , carrying him along with them . Mean Marvin took one look at the mass of semi-humanity racing toward him and instantly metamorphized into Meek Marvin , high-tailing it for the locker room . A few spectators ran after him , but most filled the court . Suddenly a life-sized dummy that looked remarkably like Marvin McCoy appeared . " Here 's what we think of you , Mean Marvin ! " cried a gremlin , throwing a rope over the backboard and tying it to the dummy 's neck . Someone else slipped Marvin 's discarded clothes onto the dummy , and set fire to it . The crowd screamed in ecstacy as Mean Marvin was burnt in effigy . Mallory was jostled this way and that , and suddenly found himself directly beneath the dummy . Just as he looked up at it , the rope holding it burned through , and the blazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved him , as the dummy hit the court less than a foot away . Mallory ducked , threw up an arm to protect himself , bumped it against the dummy , and suddenly realized that his sleeve was about to catch fire . He brushed the sparks off his arm , licking them onto his neighbors in the crowd , most of whom were totally oblivious to them . As he made his way toward an exit , he overheard one youthful gremlin , armed with an AK-47 and a flame-thrower , laugh and say to his companion , " Hey , this is even more fun than a rock concert ! " " It sure is , " came the reply . " I 'm bringing my grenades when we play the Gorgons next week ! " " Do your mothers know what you 're doing ? " demanded an elderly gentleman in outraged tones . " Sure , " replied one of the gremlins . " They 're right next door , sticking hatpins into the wrestlers . " " Oh , " said the gentleman , taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . " Make it a soccer game , and it 's not all that different from my world , thought Mallory as he walked out the front door and hailed a cab . " Do n't you understand ? " demanded Winnifred in exasperation . " You were almost killed by the Hanged Man . " " I was almost set on fire by a rag doll dressed in Marvin McCoy 's pants , " said Mallory . " There 's a difference . " " Damn it , John Justin ! " she exploded . " You get a tarot card with your face on the Star , and a framed poster of Humphrey Bogart almost brains you . Then you get a card with yourself as the Hanged Man , and the dummy of a hanging man almost sets you on fire . Do n't you see that there 's a connection ? " " It was a dummy , not a man , " protested Mallory . " And it was a poster of a star ; not the star itself , " said Winnifred . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , come on now , " muttered Mallory . " Surely you 're not suggesting that entire riot tonight was set up with the express purpose of dropping a burning dummy on me ! " " Tarot does n't work that way , " she replied . " It 's mystical . It produced the Hanged Man because someone knew this was going to happen . Someone is tinkering with your life , John Justin , and if I ca n't make you see it , then you 're going to be killed and there 's not a thing we can do to prevent it . " " What do you propose I do about it ? " demanded Mallory . " Buy a crystal ball ? Rent a magic wand ? Hire the Grundy to protect me ? " She shook her head . " Stop being facetious . " " It 's a ridiculous situation . " " It 's a deadly situation , " she corrected him . " I think you should see an expert . " " An expert in murder ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mystic sciences . " " Is n't that a contradiction in terms  --  mystic sciences ? " " Not in this Manhattan . " " All right , all right , " said Mallory with a defeated sigh . " Who should I seeR " " Well , that 's a problem , " admitted Winnifred . " By rights , you should see an expert on tarot . " " What 's the problem ? " " There are n't any experts on tarot in Manhattan . I only recognized those as tarot cards because I saw tarot decks when I was abroad . " " Okay , there are n't any experts . Then what was all the fuss about ? " " There are no tarot experts , " said Winnifred . " The greatest authority in the mystic sciences is the Queen of Diamonds . " She walked to the phone . " I 'll make an appointment and tell her it 's urgent . " " Tell her it 's idiotic . " " The most dangerous things often are , " replied Winnifred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could n't help feeling that this was a colossal waste of time , time that could be better 8pent trying to find a horse that was moving up in class and loved the mud . The sign above the door said it all : The Queen of Diamonds Palms Red , Pun Told Mallory entered the office and instantly heard a hissing sound . He looked down and saw a snake chasing a terrified mongoose around the office . Sitting at a circular table was a harsh-looking woman with biceps that would have done a prizefighter proud . She had the body of a linebacker , and the pound of makeup and lipstick that she had applied merely emphasized her lack of femininity . Her dress was black , with hundreds of little red hearts on it , and her rouge had n't quite hidden a heart on each cheek . A small man in a business suit sat next to her , a notepad in front of him , a quill pen in his hand . " You ought to give serious consideration to firing your sign painter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " asked the Queen of Diamonds , in a voice that matched her physique . At the sound of it both the snake and the mongoose began trembling uncontrollably . " It says R-SD . " " So ? " " You want R-E-A-D , " continued Mallory . " Silliest thing I ever heard , " said the Queen , holding up her hands , and Mallory could see that the palms were bright red . " My mistake . You 're the Queen of Diamonds ? " " At your service . " " My name is John Justin Mallory . I 'm a detective . My partner , Winnifred Carruthers , suggested I see you . " " Winnie ? How is the dear old buzzard ? " " Worried . " " Do n't tell me , " said the Queen of Diamonds , placing a hand on a crystal ball and closing her eyes . " It 's a goiter . Definitely benign . Causing momentary distress , but surgery is n't indicated at this moment . " " Actually , she 's worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mallory . " Well , " replied the Queen with a shrug " it had to be one or the other . " " She also thought that maybe you could tell me who wants to kill me , and why . " " If anyone can do it , the Queen of Diamonds can , " she replied . " Actually , you look a lot more like the Queen of Hearts to me , " noted Mallory . " Off with his - " began the Queen . The little man next to her placed a restraining hand on her arm . " Tuttut , " he said . " - fingernails , " she concluded weakly . " Much better , my dear , " he said . The little man turned to Mallory . " She used to be the Queen of Hearts , " he explained . " I 've been hired to change her image . " " Why ? " " She made too many enemies . " " I thought most of them did n't live long enough to do her any damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old days , " said the Queen 's publicist . " Last year was the final straw . Electricians Local 708 went on strike because of all the beheadings - they had invested their pension funds in an electric chair manufacturer - and the kingdom was without power for months . " " Off with all their - " began the Queen . " Tut-tut , my dear . " " - mustaches , " she finished lamely . " Look , " said Mallory . " Maybewe should just forget the whole thing . " " NONSENSE ! " bellowed the Queen as three windows shattered and the mongoose fainted dead away . " Well , as long as you feel that way about it ... " said Mallory . " Details , " said the Queen . " I need details . " " I keep receiving tarot cards with my image on them , and it 's remotely possible that someone is trying to kill me in ways that are suggested by the cards . " " Ah , " said the Queen with a look of grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . " " What do you know about tarot cards ? " asked Mallory . " Absolutely nothing , " she admitted . " But I know almost everything there is to know about murder . Let me see your hand . " Mallory stretched his hand out , and the Queen scrutinized it closely . " Yes , " she muttered . " Absolutely . No question about it . It 's here , and here , and here , and over here too . " Finally she looked up . " I find it difficult to believe . " " What are you seeing ? " asked Mallory . She tried to suppress an amused smirk . " You 've actually bet on Flyaway thirty-three times in , a row ! " " That 's all you see ? " " Well , I also see that you do n't wash your hands after every meal . I shudder to think of the way your elbows must look . " " What about the tarot cards ? " " I 've never seen one . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Mallory curiously . " Because the only possible illustration for the Death card would be the image of the Grundy , and since be demands an exorbitant royalty for the use of it , the manufacturers simply do n't distribute their cards in Manhattan . " " Surely they could use a different symbol for Death , " said Mallory . " Name a better one . " Mallory considered the question and finally shrugged . " You have a point . " He began to get to his feet . " Thank you for your time . I think I 'd better be getting back to the office now . " " I 'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET ! " said the Queen at a decibel level that flattened the snake and caused a crack to form on the wall behind her . " SIT ! " Mallory sat back down . " Take off that ridiculous hat . " Mallory removed the fedora . " Now lean over . " He leaned across the table , and she began feeling his head with long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " This is more like it . This is something I can get my teeth into ! " Mallory flinched at the thought of the Queen 's teeth digging into his skull , but finally decided that it was merely a figure of speech , since she kept probing his head with her fingers . " Yes , I see it all clearly now , " said the Queen . " The fog is lifting and what remains is the truth . " " Good , " said Mallory . " What do you see ? " " Neil Armstrong will be the first man to set foot on the moon , " she intoned as if in a trance . " Seattle Slew will beat Affirmed by three lengths in the Marlboro Cup . Lincoln will free the slaves . " " I guess the only difference between my head and the World Almanac is that the World Almanac is n't losing its hair , " remarked Mallory dryly . " DO N'T INTERRUPT ! " " Sorry , " said Mallory meekly . She kept probing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred wives , but he 'll have a special spot in his heart for number four hundred ninety-three . Saint Augustine 's boasting of his debaucheries will be misinterpreted as contrition . Babe Ruth will call his shot against the Chicago Cubs in the 1932 World Series . " She pressed her fingers against his head even harder . " Here it is ! Someone 's trying to kill you , Mallory ! " " That 's it ? " demanded Mallory . " That 's the sum total of everything you 've learned from reading my skull and my palm and looking into your crystal ball ? " " Not entirely , " she replied defensively . " I also know you have dandruff and that your fingernails are filthy . " " Thanks a heap , " said Mallory , getting to his feet again . " I can tell you one more thing , Mr. Mallory , " said the Queen of Diamonds . He stopped at the door and turned back to her . " What is it ? " " Something 's fishy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " " You said something 's fishy . " " Right . " " And I said , what does it mean when you say something 's fishy ? " " You want interpretations , go see an oracle , " answered the Queen of Diamonds . " I deal in facts . And it 's a fact that somethings fishy . " Mallory left even more confused than when he had entered . " Well , John Justin , " said Winnifred when he returned to the office , " how did it go ? " " About as I expected . " " That bad ? " He lit a bent Camel and did n't answer . " Are you at least convinced that the danger is real ? " persisted Winnifred . " Everyone seems to think so , " said Mallory noncommittally . " Well , almost everyone . Maybe I ought to go to the source . " " The source of the threats ? " " The source of all magic and all evil , so I can find out if these damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Grundy ? " gasped Winnifred . " The Grundy . " " But he 's the most powerful demon on the East Coast ! " " Outside of you , he 's also the only person in this world who 's never lied to me . " " Well , I wo n't have any part of it , " said Winnifred . " I 'm going out for a walk . I 'll be back after he 's gone . " She walked out and slammed the door behind her . Mallory looked around the office , and finally found what he was looking for , lying langously atop the refrigerator . " What about youR " he asked . " I 'm not afraid of the Grundy , " said Felina . " It 's nice to have one loyal friend , " said Mallory . " Oh , I 'm not loyal and I 'm not really your friend , " she corrected him . " I 'll desert you in the end . But I 'm not afraid of the Grundy . " " Thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh well , we might as well ged .

But instead of summoning the demon , as it had in the past , the only thing that happened this time was the receiver was filled with maniacal laughter . " Maybe he changed his number , " muttered Mallory . " Maybe he does n't want to talk to you , " offered Felina . " There must be some way to attract his attention , " said Mallory , looking around the office . Finally his gaze fell upon the morning paper , which , as usual , featured a drawing of the Grundy . ( Photographs of him turned out blank . Mallory cut out the drawing , taped it to a wall , then took out his personal set of darts from a desk drawer . He withdrew a dart , took careful aim , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clawed hand materialized out of thin air , just in time to catch the dart before it reached its target . The hand was attached to a strange being that appeared an instant later . He was tall , a few inches over six feet , with two prominent horns protruding from his hairless head . His eyes were a burning yellow , his nose sharp and aquiline , his teeth white and gleaming , his skin a bright red . His shirt and pants were crushed velvet , his cloak satin , his collar and cuffs made of the fur of some white polar animal . He wore gleaming black gloves and boots , and he had two mystic rubies suspended from his neck on a golden chain . When he exhaled , small clouds of vapor emanated from his mouth and nostrils . " I thought that might bring you here , " said Mallory . " Permit me to say that I have even less admiration for your sense of humor than your ethics , " replied the Grundy coldly . " What is it that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me about tarot cards . " " They are exactly like playing cards , only different . " " You 're not being very helpful , " noted Mallory . " It is not my function to be helpful , " answered the Grundy . " Do n't explain your function to me again , " said Mallory . " I 'm in a hurry . Someone is trying to kill me . " " That pleasure is reserved for me . " " Good , " said Mallory . " Then you stop him . " " I can not , " said the Grundy with honest regret . " My nature forbids me from interfering with acts of violence . " " Then tell me who 's trying to kill me and where I can find him , and maybe , as the bride-to-be said to her fiancb , I can save myself for you . " The Grundy shook his head . " I can not .

" " Yes they 're influencing even " , * or yes , they 're simply his calling cards ? " " Yes , I can tell you . " Mallory sighed . " But no , you wo n't ? " " That is correct . " " Is there anything you can tell me ? " " There is one thing , " said the Grundy . " What ? " " You had better solve this puzzle quickly , for your opponent is not likely to make too many more mistakes . " " Who is my opponent ? " " That , " said the Grundy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling . " That 's the general idea , " said Mallory , but he was talking to an empty space where the demon formerly stood . Suddenly he noticed Felina sniffing the air . " Is he still around ? " " No . He 's vanished to wherever he vanishes to , " said the cat girl . " And he took your dart with him . " " What were you smelling , then ? " " A visitor , " she answered . " A tasty visitor . " She pausedthoughtfully . " A scrumptious visitor . " Suddenly she frowned . " A huge , tasty , scrumptious visitor . " " Open the door for him , " said Mallory . Felina did as she was told , then backed away , hissing . The visitor entered the office , and Mallory found himself confronting a huge blueskinned man in a purple sharkskin suit , light blue shirt , violet tie , and navy blue shoes and socks . He stood just under seven feet tall , and weighed in the vicinity of five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Mallory . " I need a detective , " said the Prince of Whales . " You did me a good turn a few months back , and I heard on the grapevine that you could use the business . " " What seems to be the problemi " " Someone 's got a hit out on me . " " A nine-million-pounder like you comes to me for protection ? " asked Mallory . " There 's got to be more to it than that . " The Prince of Whales pulled a card out of his pocket and tossed it onto Mallory 's desk . " There have been four attempts on my life already , " he said , " and they 're always preceded by one of these . " Mallory turned the card face up . It was a tarot card of a shark , with the Prince 's face superimposed on it . " I did n't know tarot cards had sharks . " " They did n't ... until now . " " Is that legal ? " asked Mallory . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card whenever you feel like it ? " " How the hell do I know ? " demanded the Prince of Whales . " I just want this nut caught . " " You 're the proprietor of the Old Abandoned Warehouse , and the biggest fence in the city , " noted Mallory . " Surely you 've got a bunch of muscle on your payroll . " " Yeah , " acknowledged the Prince . " But they ca n't think . " He tapped his massive head with a finger . " I need someone with your brains for this , Mallory . After all , you 're the one who broke up that Blue-Nosed Reindeer scamsup 1- and you uncovered the plot to fix the elephant races.2 And the first time we met , you 'd found a missing unicom. " 3 " It 's always animals , " grumbled Mallory . He glared balefully at the card . " And this time it 's a shark . " " So will you take the job ? " " Of course I will . The son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ? " repeated the Prince of Whales . " Why ? " " I wish I knew . What does he have against you ? " " I do n't even know who he is , " said the Prince . " That 's why I came to you . " Just then Winnifred entered the office , a look of concern on her pudgy face and a card in her hand . " I found this sticking out from under the welcome mat , John Justin , " she said . " It 's a new one : the Killer Fish . " Mallory took the card from her . It was identical to the Prince of Whales 's card , except that this time Mallory 's face was the one superimposed over the shark . " What does it all mean , John Justin ? " asked Winnifred . " It means I 'm not going to see the Racing Form today , " intoned the mirror mournfully . " All this fish and nothing to eat , " sulked Felina . Mallory stared at the card for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to the Prince 's card . " Okay , " he said . " It 's starting to come together . " " It is ? " said Winnifred . " I knew I chose the right man for the job ! " said the Prince of Whales . Mallory lit another Camel , and coughed heavily . " Why do you smoke those things " asked Winnifred . " You know you hate them . " " Detectives wear trenchcoats and battered fedoras and smoke bent Camels , " answered Mallory . He decided to leave out the part about having oversexed secretaries called Velma . " And I 'm feeling like a detective right now . " " So who 's trying to kill me ? " asked the Prince . " That 's what we 're about to find out , " said Mallory . He handed the two tarot cards across the desk to the Prince of Whales . " And it should n't be that hard , because whoever it is wants me dead too . " " But who - ? " " Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met you was two years ago , and we probably did n't spend half a minute in each other 's company . The only other time we were together was when I found out you had stolen the Blue-Nosed Reindeer from Nick the Saint . " " Right , " agreed the Prince . " But where does that lead us ? " " You 're still not thinking , " said Mallory . " I had the goods on you . I could have sent you away for five years . Instead , I arranged a deal between you and Nick . You each got something you wanted , and you walked away clean . " " So ? " " So whoever 's sending the cards obviously has a grudge against both of us - me for setting up the deal , and you for taking it and not going to jail . So it 's time to ask yourself : who stood to take over the Old Abandoned Warehouse and the fence business if you 'd taken the fall ? " Suddenly the Prince 's blue eyes opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled . Mallory shot a triumphant smile at Winnifred , then turned back to the Prince . " Who is it ? " " I have a twin brother , " he said . " An evil twin , even by the standards of our family . His name 's Skippy . He would have taken over . " " Then he 's our man . " Mallory frowned . " At least , I think he is . " " What 's wrong ? " asked the Prince . " You look troubled . " " Well , if he 's your twin , the tarot card should show a whale , not a shark . " " We 're identical twins , " explained the Prince . " But I 'm a lot more identical than Skippy . He 's a shark , all right . " " Then all we have to do is send the cops to his place and lock him away . " " It 's not that easy , " said the Prince of Whales . " Somehow it never is . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where he is , or who he 's staying with . " " Then we 're going to have to lure him out , " said Mallory . " What kind of bait did you have in mind ? " interjected Winnifred . " Oh , I do n't know , " replied Mallory . " But if he 's a shark , we need something that can attract him . " He paused thoughtfully . " Maybe half a ton of whale blubber and a worn-out detective who 's seen better days . " " I do n't know about this , " said the Prince of Whales uncomfortably . " Back when we were just minnows , he always used to kick the shit out of me . Probably he still can . " " Come on , " said Mallory . " You 're two fullbacks and three defensive tackles all rolled into one , with a couple of jockeys left over . " " I 'm strong , but I 'm slow , " said the Prince . " We complement each other perfectly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow . " " I do n't like the feel of this , " said the Prince . " We may not get another opportunity , " said Mallory . " Look , I do n't know from tarot cards , but somehow they told him we 'd be together right now , since we both got the same one . And since they 're the Killer Fish , he 's not trying to keep his identity a secret anymore . He plans to kill us both together , so now 's the best time to set him up . " " Makes sense to me , " said the magic mirror . " It does ? " replied Mallory half-seriously . " Then I must have made a mistake somewhere along the way . " " Well , I like that ! " said the mirror . " You liked Screaming Mimi in the 4th at Jamaica last week , " said Mallory . " Last I heard , she was still running - and was such a traffic hazard that all the tortoises had to go around her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't have to take any more of this crap ! I 'm going on strike ! " It went dark , and a moment later began displaying an endless rerun of the 3rd inning of a scoreless 1963 American Association baseball game between El Paso and Tucson . Felina watched in rapt fascination , trying to claw the ball every time it left the pitcher 's hand . " I still do n't like the thought of playing bait for Skippy , " complained the Prince of Whales . " You 've got a magic mirror . Ca n't it do something ? " " Not all dogs are watchdogs , " said Mallory . " Not all seven-footers can play basketball . And , especially , not all magic mirrors are worth the powder to blow " em to hell . " " Well , think of something else , because I 'm not going to be bait and wait for Skippy to attack me . " " All right , " said Mallory . " There 's another way . " He walked over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Prince . " What was that all about ? " asked the Prince suspiciously . " Just some last-minute instructions in case Skippy shows up here . In the meantime , you 're going to move in with me at my apartment , just in case he 's staking out your digs . Also , this way we can take turns keeping watch . " The Prince of Whales nodded his massive head . " I approve . " Mallory studied him for a long moment . " I 've barely got enough food for me . Maybe we 'd better pick up some cold cuts and a few gallons of beer on the way home . " He and the Prince walked to the door . " Good-night , John Justin , " said Winnifred . " See you in the morning , " said Mallory . " If you live that long , " said Felina , never taking her orange eyes off the magic mirror . NOODNIK 'S MARKET was just around the corner from Mallory 's apartment . If it had a second advantage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd lived in this Manhattan . He and the Prince of Whales entered the store just after midnight . Seymour Noodnik himself was on duty , and instantly approached the detective . " How 's tricks , Mallory ? " he asked , and then lowered his voice to a whisper : " You here on a case ? " " I 'm here to pick up some dinner . " " No serial killers ? No lewd lady exhibitionists ? No - / " " Just dinner . " Noodnik shrugged , " Got a specialty on robins " teeth . " " Robins " teeth ? " " Well , they might be sparrows ' . But I 'll make you a good price . " " What the hell do I want with birds " teeth ? " asked Mallory . " That 's not my business , " said Noodnik . " I just sell " em . How about an Upside-Down Nightcrawler ? " " Never heard of it . " " Of course not , " said Noodnik . " They 're new on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head at one end and a tail at the other ? " " So ? " Noodnik reached into a shirt pocket and withdrew a large worm , holding it up by its tail . " Well , these babies have got their tails on top and their heads down at the other end . Neat , huh ? " " Why would I want a nightcrawler no matter which end the head was on ? " asked Mallory . " Cheap source of protein , " answered Noodnik . " And look at the little bastard . Friendly , affable , laughs at your jokes . You could establish a lasting friendship with him - at least until your hunger got the better of you . " " We 'll just look around , " said Mallory . " How about minotaur steak ! " cried Noodnik . " Flown in fresh from Hialeah . You can still see the jockey 's whip marks . " " Some other time . " " You 're a hard man to sell , Mallory . " " Do n't try to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling you what you do want takes all the challenge out of it ! " complained Noodnik . " Look , the pants I 'm wearing are made of unborn denim . I 'll sell " em to you at cost , and toss in the shirt off my back . " " Later , maybe . " " Mallory , you drive me crazy ! " " I think somebody beat me to it , " said Mallory . A small woman with a bloody ax entered just then , and asked to be shown to the casket department . Noodnik immediately began trying to sell her a meat grinder , and Mallory quickly walked down an empty aisle , followed by the Prince of Whales . " Is he always like that ? " asked the Prince . " Only when he 's awake , " said Mallory . " Now let 's start looking for something to eat . " They walked past a number of canned items - the store was having a sale on harpy wings and jellied pegasus hooves - and finally wound up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " murmured Mallory , looking into the various glass cases . " This stuff does n't look so fresh . Maybe we 'll buy some fish or lobster instead . " " Sounds fine by me , " said the Prince . They walked a little farther until they came to a huge tank filled with perhaps two hundred lobsters . " Choose one , " suggested Mallory . " That one , " said the Prince of Whales , indicating a large lobster in the middle of the tank . " Okay , " said Mallory . " The butcher does n't seem to be around , so pull it out yourself . " The Prince of Whales rolled up his sleeve and stuck his hand into the tank - and suddenly froze . " What 's the problem ? " asked Mallory . " Pull it out . " " It 's pulling back ! " gasped the Prince . " Come on - you 're stronger than a lobster . " " I would have agreed with you until about ten seconds ago , " grated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All right , then , let go of it . " " It wo n't let go of mel " cried the Prince . Mallory threw his arms around the Prince 's arm - trying to encircle his waist was an impossibility - and pulled . Suddenly he and the Prince of Whales were falling backward , and standing before them , dripping wet , was a scaly creature , half-man and half-fish , with a huge fin extending from his back . He pulled his bloodless lips back into a nasty grin , revealing a sharp set of oversized teeth . " You/ " exclaimed the Prince . " Yes , me , " said Skippy . " I 've been waiting for this moment , dreaming of it and planning for it , ever since that day when you robbed me of my rightful inheritance ! " " If you want a fortune , go work for it like your brother did , " said Mallory , getting to his feet and brushing off his trenchcoat . " And you , " said Skippy , turning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go to jail ! What kind of scumbucket detective gets the goods on someone and then does n't turn him over to the cops ? " " The kind who is n't working for the cops in the first place , " said Mallory . " I was hired to solve a problem . I solved it . " " And it 'll cost you your life , bite by bite ! " hissed Skippy . " Do n't be too sure of that , " said Mallory calmly . " I was hired to solve you , too . " What are you talking about . " " I 'm talking about the lady with the rifle who 's standing fifteen feet behind you . " " You think I 'll fall for that old gag ? " demanded Skippy with a contemptuous laugh . " No , I think you 'll fall when I drill you with a couple of shots from this .550 Nitro Express , " said Winnifred Carruthers , training the gun on Skippy 's head . Skippy spun around and faced her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're detectives , remember ? " said Winnifred with a smile . " We did n't know much about sharks , " said Mallory , " but we know they like to hang around in water . " He paused . " I 'm a creature of habit . This is the only food store I shop at and the only water I 'm ever near . I was sure you 'd been studying me , so this figured to be where you 'd make your move , if not tonight , then tomorrow or the next day . So I had my partner stake it out . " Skippy looked from Winnifred to Mallory . " She 's just a fat old woman , " he said at last . " What makes you think she can hit a moving target ? If she fires that gun , the bullet 'll more likely hit you or my brother . " " Skippy , I 'm going to do you a favor , " said Mallory . " A bigger favor than you deserve . " He pulled a coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , tossing it into the air . Winnifred took aim and fired . The coin fell to the floor , a hole in the center of it . " She 's got a black belt in karate , too , " said Mallory with a smile . As he spoke , Seymour Noodnik approached them , butcher knife in hand , attracted by the commotion . " Now you serve your time , or Noodnik will be serving you tomorrow morning . " " Is there a problemS " asked Noodnik . " Or is there just another fish to be ... processed ? " Skippy quickly assessed the situation and walked over to Winnifred , hands clasped behind his massive head . " I 'm your prisoner , " he said . " If you let him touch me , you 'll be breaking the law . " " Who would ever know ? " asked the Prince of Whales . " How can you say that to me , your own loving brother ? " demanded Skippy . " You just tried to kill me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , " interjected Noodnik , brandishing his knife . " That was murder . This is business . " Skippy turned to Winnifred . " I appeal to you . Would you want my death on your conscience ? " XI would , " said a familiar voice as a grinning Felina stepped out from behind another tank , each hand holding a writhing fish . " I 'll just bet you would , " said Mallory . " It 'll be the only bet you win all month , " purred Felina , biting the head off each fish in turn . After they turned Skippy over to the police and the Prince of Whales paid them their fee , the two detectives decided to celebrate by going out for a very late dinner . Felina , after promising not to misbehave until sunrise ( or at least to try very hard not to ) , was allowed to accompany them . The only place open was Ming Toy Epstein 's Kosher Chinese Noodle Factory , and the only item still available at that hour was shark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I still do n't know why he chose tarot cards , " said Winnifred . " He was a card shark . It 's a small step from passing market cards to using cards as threats . " " But we do n't have any tarot cards in Manhattan . " " That 's why he used them . This was n't some psycho who secretly wanted to be caught - and if you do n't want to be caught , it makes more sense to taunt your potential victim with something he 's never seen before . " " Why did he send four non-tarot cards along with that first one ? " " His notion of misdirection . " Mallory smiled . " Sharks are n't the brightest fish in the sea . " Mallory and Winnifred tentatively sipped their soup . " You know , it 's not bad , " remarked Mallory , surprised . " Maybe we should have left Skippy to Noonik 's tender mercies . " " It would have saved the city a lot of money , " acknowledged Winnifred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of keeping him and he 'll probably go free in two years and come right after you again . " Mallory cracked open his fortune cookie . " Oh , I doubt it , " he said . " why ? " He laid the fortune slip down in front of her . " Good fortune is in the cards , " " she read . " So much for Death By Card Shark , " said Mallory . He stared at the fortune spn . " Do you suppose this also means Flyaway has a chance tomorrow ? " Winnifred wondered if a sharp blow to the head might cure her partner 's obsession , but decided it would probably just be a waste of good pottery .
