Dick Armey , who emerged last week as Washington 's biggest obstacle to a minimum-wage increase , is the kind of guy Americans say they want in Congress . After 11 years in Washington , the former economics professor still drives his Ford pickup to work , refuses to wear a tuxedo to obligatory gala dinners and is a connoisseur of drive-through meals , which he devours between meetings in his north Dallas district . ( McDonald 's hamburgers are more efficient than Wendy 's , Armey says , because " they do n't drip . " ) He is as likely to quote Popeye  --  " I yam what I yam , " he told a town-hall gathering in April  --  as his idol , Nobel-prizewinning economist Milton Friedman . And as a devout libertarian conservative , the House majority leader steers by strong convictions  --  against farm subsidies , in favor of opening U.S. borders to more immigrants  --  even when those convictions put him at odds with some of his party 's powerful interest groups . <P> Most politicians in Armey 's position would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put Armey in day-to-day charge of legislation , in part because the Speaker 's high negative ratings were dragging down House Republicans as well as their party . But as Armey proved last week , when he rallied conservative Republicans behind his opposition to the minimum wage , the Texan sees more virtue in taking a stand than in compromising . The leader 's job normally goes to someone with patience , flexible principles and an instinct for horse trading . In other words , it 's not an obvious assignment for Armey , an ideological purist with a reputation for razor-edged one-liners who says he would much rather go bass fishing than spend another hour negotiating with President Clinton . On a recent visit to his district , Armey hopped from town-hall meetings to Rotary Club luncheons , warning his constituents to expect the worst out of Washington this spring and summer . " You 're gon na be frustrated , " Armey told a group of military academy alumni in Irving , Texas . " We 'll argue all year long . " <P> In Armey 's overwhelmingly Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across Red River valley farmland , that kind of talk usually goes down well . At a town-hall meeting , Armey , dressed in his trademark dark suit and cowboy boots , got riled when an atypical constituent accused him of gutting environmental-protection laws in order to give corporate polluters a break . " I 'm not gon na take a lecture that I need to compromise , " Armey fired back . " I 've got compromise fatigue . " The voter was booed down .
