<p> SOHAR , Oman  --  That guy Lawrence , T.E . Lawrence , made his name in these parts on the back of a camel . Remember the movie ? He cries , " Hut , hut , hut ! " and whacks his crop on the animal , and off he rides across the sands and into legend . <p> And now here I am on the southeastern cusp of the Arabian Peninsula , the quiet blue-green waters of the Indian Ocean at my back , Iran beyond the eastern horizon  --  WAY beyond the horizon , I am pleased to say  --  well , of course , I would ride a camel . <p> I am in the Sultanate of Oman , which is a country . It is not to be confused with Amman , which is a city in Jordan , although both are in the largely misunderstood Middle East . <p> Oman is the difference between a B and a C on a geography exam . . . if anyone actually studied geography anymore . It 's like Benin , or Brunei or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brows wrinkle . It is famous for  --  extra credit if you knew this  --  frankincense . <p> Oman is about the size of New Mexico , and it looks very much like New Mexico . It is about 85 percent desert , with sand dunes as high as 600 feet , and there are vast caverns and mountain ranges with serrated peaks . <p> There are old , thick-walled forts with crenelated parapets and cylindrical watchtowers guarding the mountain passes of ancient trade routes . And there are markets , called souks , where weaving , pottery and silverware are sold along with produce , frankincense and myrrh . <p> It would look a whole lot more like New Mexico if New Mexico had about 1,000 miles of beautiful , pristine beaches . <p> From afar  --  say , from America  --  this is , if not an exotic destination in this shrinking globe of ours , certainly the end of the road less traveled . Up close , it is , well , probably not at all what you would imagine . <p> There ARE camels here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nissan 4x4s . This camel I am mounting is something of a prop . I 'm probably the only person in all of Oman riding a camel at this moment . <p> I am not heading off into the vast , shifting dunes  --  I had wanted to do that at a Bedouin camp , but their mode of transportation turned out to be a Toyota pickup . Instead I will take a lap on my camel ( for about $ 2.75 ) around the lush grounds of the Sohar Beach Hotel ( motto : Sohar So Good ) . <p> So off we go at a slow walk , camel holder leading this beast over putting-green lawns , circling the huge swimming pool , past English garden plantings of pansies , petunias , even magnolias . <p> I 'm not about to do that " Hut , hut , hut ! " thing  --  giddyup in camel talk  --  because it 's pretty high up here and there are no stirrups , nothing to hold on to except a thin rope . <p> It all goes well until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some palm fronds . So my Indiana Jones hat goes flying off and I very nearly follow . But I manage to keep my seat , if not my dignity . Lawrence can have this . Camels are not what Oman is all about , anyway . <p> Not long ago , a poll was conducted in which American travelers were asked which city , country or region they were most afraid to travel to on vacation . The Middle East led by 30 percent . New York City tied with Iraq for second place , followed by Israel , Iran , Los Angeles and Bosnia-Herzegovina . <p> I do n't want to belabor this ignorance of geography thing . . . but I will . Oman is about as much like that part of the Middle East that has been making the evening news since biblical times with its internecine struggles as New York City is like , well , New Mexico . <p> Oman is different . <p> Oman thinks of itself more as a Gulf State , as in Arabian Gulf ( which most of the world calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time )  --  with Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain , Qatar and the United Emirates . <p> But Oman is different , even from them . It is a Gulf State , but just barely . Only its Musandem Peninsula , an enclave separated from the bulk of the country by the Emirates , touches the waters of the Arabian Gulf , forming the Strait of Hormuz . <p> It was , and still is to some extent , a seafaring nation . It is the legendary home of Sinbad the Sailor . Omani ships  --  vessels with planks sewn together with palm fibers  --  reached the Malay Peninsula and Canton in China in the 9th century . <p> If you 're a little hazy about Oman 's place on the world map , you may be excused . It 's mostly Oman 's own fault . But under the enlightened leadership of Sultan Qaboos bin Said , the Omanis are changing all that in a most dramatic fashion . <p> Steeped in legend and mystery until the early 1970s , Oman has emerged from a Middle Ages-style , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century with the rest of us  --  in one generation . Oman is , in essence , all of a quarter-century old . <p> And the Omanis ( there are about 1.5 million of them , plus 500,000 expatriots ) have done it without nearly as many petro-dollars to throw about as their other Gulf neighbors , although the discovery of modest Omani oil reserves was a decided factor . <p> Mostly it was Qaboos ( pronounced like the last car of a railroad train ) . Absolute monarchs have the sort of clout it takes . <p> In July , 1970 , he deposed his father , the xenophobic Sultan Said bin Taimur , in a bloodless coup . He quickly set about modernizing , and beautifying , his kingdom , all the while carefully preserving a culture with roots 4,000 years old . <p> It was a daunting task . But it was rapidly accomplished . <p> In 1970 , Oman was one of the world 's most primitive nations . There were six miles of paved roads , no newspapers , no radio or television stations , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power plant , three schools with a total of 909 pupils and 30 teachers , and one hospital . Life expectancy was 47 years . <p> Private cars were forbidden , permits were needed even to wear eyeglasses  --  a Western " corruption "  --  and there were no streetlights lest Omanis be tempted to carouse . Promptly at 8 p.m. , a cannon boomed and the heavy wooden gates of Muscat , the capital , were closed tight . <p> Today , there is a modern international airport outside the capital city of Muscat , and there are more than 3,000 miles of paved roads connecting all the country 's major cities . <p> You should see these highways . Roadside grass is manicured like a golf course fairway ; the roads are lined with palms , shrubs , flowers and  --  peculiar to this part of the world  --  roundabout and roadside art . <p> Again , Oman is different . Unlike people in most Arab countries , Omanis obey traffic rules  --  staying in lanes , giving turn signals , more or less obeying the speed limit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get in the Middle East . <p> Today , there is an elaborate water system and an electrical grid of 31 power stations . There are numerous radio stations , and satellite dishes sprout from virtually every house . <p> There are 965 primary and secondary schools for boys and girls , 250 literacy centers and nearly 200 adult-learning centers , and a Sultan Qaboos University . There are 48 hospitals and 116 health centers . Life expectancy is 68 years . <p> Muscat 's huge gates are still here , but today they are merely symbolic . They stand open and inviting . <p> The ancient forts , watchtowers and buildings have been restored to a **26;485;TOOLONG state . Yet , Muscat does not have the nouveau riche look that typifies much of the rest of the Gulf region . <p> There is no graffiti , no litter . It is not allowed . A first offense results in a substantial fine ; a second offense means jail time . Street sweepers go about their business twice a day . Sometimes I have more litter in the back seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . <p> And speaking of cars , they are all clean ( and new ) . Omanis are fined for driving a dirty car . <p> There are just-like-America shopping centers , and the proliferation of U.S.-style fast-food outlets is amazing . <p> And there 's an ice skating rink , of all things , in downtown Muscat . <p> But " old " Oman still exists in Muscat and throughout the country . I visited the fish market , swarming with Omanis , Asians , Indians and pale Europeans and tread carefully through the narrow aisles of stuff for sale heaped on the ground . It 's more than a fish market , really . <p> The signs , in Arabic and English , on the buildings are straightforward : " Sale of Chicken , " " Sale of Live Chicken , " " Butchery , " " Sale of Meat . " In one , a butcher works in the open air , knife flashing , trimming fat . <p> And there are the fish , of course , piles of fish on the pavement , sellers sprinkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , skinny and fat , silver , pink , green , gray and yellow fish . Buyers poke the flesh , lift the gills to check for freshness , carry them off in sky blue and turquoise plastic bags . Sellers take their crumpled bills in bloody , slimy hands and stuff them in their caps . <p> The Mutrah souk , or general market , is considered by many to be the best in the Middle East . It 's certainly the most pleasant of the many I 've visited . It 's hawking without hassle . <p> The Omanis were one of the first people to convert to Islam . Most of them , including the royal family , belong to the Ibadhi sect , a schismatic group committed to a pure form of Islam from the earliest times and , therefore , less susceptible to the fundamentalist revival causing unrest in much of the rest of the Arab world . <p> They are strict in certain public morality practices  --  no drinking , dating or mixed dancing , that sort of thing  --  not unlike a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Their strong sense of national identity is manifested in their traditional dress  --  much like their other Gulf States neighbors , but not exactly . <p> Men wear an ankle-length , long-sleeved , pocketless shirt-dress called a dishdasha , most often a sort of mauve  --  the sort of color produced by the first dip in an indigo dye . It is usually less tightly cut than those worn by other Gulf Arabs . <p> On their heads , rather than the loose head scarf worn by most Arabs , Omani men wear a tightly wound turban ( mussar ) or a small brimless cap ( kimah ) . <p> Women 's dress is far more colorful , though no more revealing , than the simple black cloaks common in much of the rest of the Gulf region . Brightly printed dresses are wrapped with equally colorful printed shawls and veils . <p> Most women wear at least a partial veil in public . Some Bedouin women I saw wore a stiffened mask , dyed a deep indigo and then colored with gold . The masks are so exquisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took forever to get the indigo dye off my hands . <p> Omanis are friendly , remarkably so . Make eye contact with an Omani man and you will get a smile , a nod , maybe even a spoken greeting . Everyone seems to know how to say " How are you ? " in English . <p> As a man , I do not know about eye contact with Omani women . It really just is not done  --  on the street or in the souk , at any rate . Many have their faces at least partly covered . <p> And Omanis are quick to display the traditional Arab hospitality . Several Omanis I met invited me into their homes for a meal , and the Bedouins at the edge of the Wahiba Sands insisted we sit under a tent on blankets spread over the sand and have hot , cardamom-flavored coffee , called askhawa , drunk black and without sweetening from tiny , handleless cups . <p> The local custom is to add one part cardamom to nine parts coffee , which is supposed to take away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual to this , and to do it is to experience a lifestyle . It 's men only , for one thing . Coffee is poured , by the eldest man present , from a traditional metal pot into the cups . It is customary to drink three cups before shaking the cup from side to side as it is handed back . This is a signal that no more is required . <p> Usually coffee is accompanied by dates , halwa , an Omani specialty that is best described as a sweetmeat with a rather glutinous texture not unlike Turkish Delight , and often sliced oranges . <p> The protocol is to sit cross-legged , taking care not to display the soles of your feet , and to use only the right hand for eating and drinking . <p> Outside coastal Muscat , on the way to the sites and cities of the interior , much of the landscape is bleak  --  gravel and stone are strewn at random over sand and hardpan . <p> In Nizwa , there is another remarkable old-new market , mud and stone juxtaposed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The goat market here , on Fridays , is a highlight . They also sell cows and sheep . It 's an open area with tall palms shading a gravel piazza . On off days , they sell fresh-cut alfalfa in large bundles along with dried fish , mostly shark . <p> In another area , there are swords , khanjars , knives , ammo belts and guns you would n't believe  --  some downright ancient . <p> For centuries , Nizwa was capital of the interior . The Nizwa fort and palace , more than 1,000 years old , have been restored to their former glory using tradition building materials and methods . <p> It looks very much like a slightly scaled-down version of the Mausoleum of the Emperor Hadrian , better known today as Castel Sant'Angelo , on the banks of the Tiber in Rome . <p> Nearby is Bahla , also a one-time capital of the sultanate . It still retains the character of an old Omani town , complete with nearly seven miles of mud-brick walls encircling it . It has recently been designated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southernmost region , Dhofar , is one of the few places in the world where the low , twisted , thorny trees that produce frankincense will grow ( neighboring Yeman and Ethiopia and Somalia in northeastern Africa are the others ) . On this incense was built Oman 's original empire . <p> For thousands of years , frankincense has been burned from Karnak to Nineveh , from Rome to Constantinopole , and even in the courts of primitive northern Europe . <p> According to ancient documents , the annual consumption of frankincense in the temple of Baal in Babylon was 2 1/2 tons . According to the historian Pliny , the Emperor Nero burned the whole of Arabia 's annual production at the funeral of his wife Popea . Egyptians used it for embalming . <p> The frankincense and myrrh ( another incense ) gifts brought to the infant Jesus were , at the time , move valuable than gold . <p> It was prized mostly because it smelled good and people did n't . <p> The fat , prickly branches of the frankincense trees are slit , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil content , which means in burns well . It also is believed to have medicinal qualities . It still is sold ( and burned ) almost everywhere in Oman . <p> Gradually , personal hygiene and air conditioning have diminished the demand for frankincense . Besides , you ca n't make a Rolex watch out of little clumps of resin . <p> Stephen Harriman is a Virginia writer.mex14mP$ PAPER:CHICAGO SUN-TIMES <p> HUATULCO , Mexico Getting dropped off miles from civilization and being left with a Jeep driver whose English was worse than my Spanish ( i.e. really bad ) should have been my first clue that this was no ordinary river kayak tour . <p> But I was willing to go with the flow . I 'd already learned that that 's the key to enjoying Huatulco , on Mexico 's Pacific coast . <p> Things are still a little wild here . Carved from a jungle , with no real cultural history , this is a part of Mexico that 's in search of an identity , a purpose  --  and tourists . Hence , the kayak tour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term ) to draw folks into a place that 's still figuring out exactly what it 's going to be when it grows up . <p> So , I crammed into some very basic transportation with the driver and a family of four from Mexico City . We headed deep into the jungle along what I thought was a rough trail  --  until we turned onto something that made that earlier trail look like a superhighway . <p> Arriving near the Zimatan River 's edge , I got the idea that maybe I was going to have to swim across the river . I left my camera behind . A good call , considering what was to come , but a definite shame in terms of the historical record of this unusual excursion . <p> Six of us ( a mom , dad , daughter , son , me and a guide ) waded across the chilly , waist-deep river . We followed the guide , sneakers squishing , up a rocky slope , along a trail and a rocky cliff . We headed over a crag , around on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith , but I was on the lookout for those kayaks . Nowhere in sight . <p> Maybe I 'm on the wrong tour , I thought . Hard to tell . ( I do n't know the Spanish word for kayak . ) <p> We reach a scenic overlook that would have been worthy of a photo ( if I had n't left my camera in the Jeep ) , when the guide says what I think means , " OK , now you all have to jump off the cliff into the river . " <p> Naw . I figure it must be my poor command of the language  --  until father and son start scooting into position to jump . What the heck ? I do n't have any other way to get back , and I 'm already wet . <p> I jump about two stories down . I float . I bob . I land on the shore slightly downstream from the Jeep . . . and there 's that pesky kayak . Who needs a water park ? <p> The trip in the kayak is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice , sturdy rubber raft with a guide . Not me . They wave and laugh as I 'm left with another guide and a kayak . We dash through rapids , we maneuver around rocks , trees and small children fishing . And I see some of the loveliest virgin terrain around . The local folk washing their clothes on the rocks look like they think I 'm a little loco , which maybe I am . <p> But it 's an awfully good way to enjoy the natural beauty of this rugged coastal region , a 22-mile stretch along a series of nine bays and nearly four dozen beaches in the state of Oaxaca . <p> We all survive and scamper up a hill , through someone 's vegetable garden and over a barbed-wire fence to get back to the Jeep . At an open-air restaurant by the bridge , I throw caution to the wind and gorge myself on sweet , succulent langostinos ( little lobsters ) , fresh tortillas and the best salsa ever . <p> Over Coronas ( them ) and Frescas ( me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four from Mexico City to Chicago . I promise them Chicago-style pizza . Not quite as good as the langostinos , but close . <p> And I promise we will not kayak our river  --  at least not in December . <p> Visiting Huatulco ( pronounced wha-tool-co ) is about expecting the unexpected . This is not to say I was expecting to end up ( literally ) jumping off a cliff . Let 's just say I was n't all together surprised . This planned resort area is following in the footsteps of Cancun and Ixtapa , which were designed by the same governmental agency . Planners are hoping to do it better , cleaner , safer and much more environmentally friendly than its older sisters . But Huatulco is still feeling its way . <p> On another day when a scuba trip was casually canceled , I somehow agreed to rush over for a jungle tour via all-terrain , four-wheel motorcycle instead . <p> Garbed still in flip-flops and bikini ( snorkel and mask in tow ) , I hopped on an ATV behind some wild-haired guy named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a view of the jungle and beaches not accessible by car , at no point did I know where we were going . I just held on , kept the faith and enjoyed the ride . The tour , about $ 30 , lasts several hours . <p> A horseback tour at Rancho Caballo del Mar , also about $ 30 , was more mellow , but had its own surprises . Denis Castene guided our group of four , switching easily between Spanish ( for the rest of the group ) and English ( for me ) as he explained the varied content of the forest , the plans for Huatulco and whatever else happened along . We meandered through forest that is supposed to be a botanical garden some day , along dense jungle trails and steep , rugged ocean cliffs to an isolated beach . <p> The stretch of blinding white sand was home to a small restaurant , an old boat , an older dog and a few tables reached only on horseback or on foot . When Castene asked if I wanted to gallop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse was racing along the beach as I held on for dear life , loving every moment . Most trail rides are nose-to-tail ambles along bland paths . This was n't . It was very much like Huatulco : a little rough around the edges , but beautiful . Not quite like most every other place . <p> That was OK with me  --  and most everyone who lives there . <p> " Life here is good . There 's not so much money , but the people are happy , " said Castene as he eased his horse down a forest path . <p> All along the Bays of Huatulco , that is the story people tell . <p> " I 've been here almost 10 years . I came when it was only jungle . No electricity . No sewers . The money still is n't great , but it will be , and life is good here , " said another local . <p> In Huatulco , that 's the plan , at least . They hope for better money , while still keeping the good quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Beyond its friendly , homespun feel , the region 's biggest draw is the natural beauty . The nine bays are something even the most clever tourism official could n't have created . <p> On a recent midweek day , a boat trip on the choppy Pacific landed me on one of the prettiest little stretches of beach around . Just me , one other passenger and the boat and captain . From our quiet cove , there was no hint of civilization . Not another footprint in sight . <p> The snorkeling was a little rough , but I sat with my toes in the sand , birds overhead , jungle behind me , and knew with certainty this was a perfect place to rest . <p> Most every beach on which I landed , either by boat or horseback , on foot , all-terrain scooter or car , was a variation on the same theme . <p> Visitors can book five- and seven-bay tours , which include time for snorkeling , swimming or relaxing at one or two bays . Options include a catamaran , a yacht or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Many independent operators will offer their services , but it 's good to book through a travel agency . The agencies also can book a variety of other eco-adventures to get you deeper into Huatulco . <p> You may find yourself wet , muddy or going over the edge , but it will be worth it .
