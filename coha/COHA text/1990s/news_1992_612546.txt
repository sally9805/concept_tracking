<p> In Spain some years ago , on a dining terrace overlooking a less polluted Mediterranean Sea , we casually ordered assorted appetizers as beginning to a first-day lunch . We knew we 'd get plenty to eat . As seasoned , guidebook-reading travelers , we remembered that Spanish midday meals are on the substantial side . <p> Still , we were hardly prepared for the appearance of two large trays , each borne by a dour - though pleasant enough - waitress . Forthwith , the women covered every spare inch of our table with variously shaped nibble plates . We gasped . We grinned . We stuffed ourselves silly on octopus stew , fried squid , garlic potato salad , stuffed fresh sardines , eggs , aged ham , olives and a couple of dozen more dishes . <p> We did less than full justice to the meal 's subsequent marvels : garlic soup , grilled hake , roast veal , spinach with almonds , flan , coffee and brandy . <p> Spaniards dine as if they still rule the world . For the next couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ruled by events in Barcelona . Let 's eat accordingly . <p> Those who visit Spain via television , and hunger for it , can find local bites at the restaurants discussed below - one new , the others veterans . <p> If heading for the real Barcelona , clip my checklist , assembled after a recent visit . <p> Tasty lessons in the philosophy of Spanish dining are offered in Alan Sverdlik 's essay on the subject ( below ) . <p> Viva Decatur <p> Trout Navarre , an entree at Cafe Montserrat , may be the most authentically delicious , characteristically Spanish dish in Atlanta . Like much from Spanish kitchens , the elements are simple : An entire , nearly boneless mountain trout is sauteed in olive oil and topped with julienne ham , garlic and lemon juice . In this case , the interior is moist , the outside admirably crisp , the fish handsomely presented on a white platter . Every morsel is an edible postcard from Spain , each bite better than the last . Served with red-jacket potatoes and first-rate fresh spinach spiked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just under $ 11 . <p> Meals at Cafe Montserrat , located opposite the new courthouse in Decatur , do n't always hit this high standard . That was also true at the proprietors ' former stand , The Spanish Cafe in Chamblee . <p> Tapas , the characteristic appetizer snacks of Barcelona , appear in a dozen guises at Cafe Montserrat . Sampling four , we scored 2-2 . House- smoked trout filets , bracing as the click of castanets , are memorable enough . Sea scallops sauteed with prosciutto are tasty and garlicky , though on the pricey side at almost $ 8 for five . But a Spanish omelet containing potatoes lacked zip despite attractive chorizo-olive oil undertones . Tasteless shrimp had not the least aromatic kick - though called garlic shrimp on the menu - and were expensive throwaways at $ 7 . <p> A far better place to start than the shrimp is gazpacho Andaluz , one of the better versions of this classic , cold summer-garden soup . Mixed salads that are n't whirled in the Robotcoup food chopper - fresh romaine and curly-edged lettuces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent herb vinaigrette - are coolly inviting . Cuban-style black bean soup with chopped onions is hearty and unobjectionable . <p> Chicken in garlic sauce , a $ 5 lunch plate , was more than I could eat . The half chicken ( which tasted freshly cooked ) was roasted in olive oil , garlic , herbs and pepper . Equally nice were sides of roasted potatoes and a ratatouille-like stir-fry of squash , peppers and tomatoes . One practically perfect plate of lightly oiled angel hair pasta topped with tastily grilled chicken breast , mushrooms and dried tomatoes , an April lunch special , was my introduction to Cafe Montserrat . <p> Zarzuela , a classic , tomato-based seafood stew served at night , seemed overpriced at almost $ 16 . The stew 's rich Mediterranean flavors ( fennel , saffron and garlic ) , a tasty though smallish lobster tail and a right-looking earthenware bowl were neutralized by overcooked , tasteless shrimp , shellfish and hunks of salmon . Roast pork with clams and potatoes , a Portuguese dish , is nothing special . <p> Desserts are n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list . Assuming you have calories to waste , order a side bowl of aioli instead . This wickedly assertive mayonnaise - it contains enough garlic to ward off all the witches in Catalonia - really picks up laggardly , imperfect dishes such as the pork and seafood stews . And smeared on bread ? Ole , amigos ! <p> I wish fixing foggy-moony service was as easy . One waitress seemed intent on protecting the chef from overwork . Another day , her colleague disappeared suddenly after taking our orders , replaced by a phalanx of headwaiter-manager types harrying us with coos and howizits . ( Folks at other tables appeared to receive considerably less attention . ) <p> Cafe Montserrat , named for the holy mountains and monastery of Catalonia , is otherwise comfortable and attractive , with a playing fountain and plenty of room between tables . In recent memory , the space housed a department store as well as restaurants of the Italian , contemporary-American and Cuban-Spanish variety . In general , this feels - and feeds - better . <p> Dish by Spanish dish <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the area . <p> The Spanish Cafe . 4847 Peachtree Road N.E. , Chamblee. 452-8544 . <p> Paella Valenciana at this friendly , somewhat down-at-the-heels standby is just what you might get in Barcelona at the same sort of place . The braised rice has precisely the right ( wet ) texture and ( light ) mix of fish and spice flavors . Mussels and clams are average ; chicken is chunks of white meat resembling the stuff that arrives in boxes , not on the bone ; sliced chorizo sausage is so-so . But a garnish of lime sets the thing off visually , and the dish works well indeed . <p> Rabbit stew - half the animal - with olives , onions and tomato , is equally substantial , authentic and satisfying . Ditto a gutsy green salad accompanying such dishes . <p> On a recent visit , service was slower than a rich man 's funeral , with waiters seemingly unable to wrest plates away from the kitchen crew . The place was about half full , thus not notably busy . Both waiters , pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . <p> Mambo. 1402-8 N. Highland Ave . 876-2626 . <p> Though known primarily for Miami Beach decor and Cuban-American food , the restaurant offers a weekly quintet of tapas for $ 9.95 , a plentiful appetizer for two people . When ordering this option , each diner is also entitled to two half glasses of sherry , port or wine for $ 3 . Note that this extra-special is available Mondays-Thursdays only . <p> Early this month , the tapa spread included four winners : a simple ceviche of lime-marinated grouper and red onion sprinkled with chopped cilantro ; a thumb-size hunk of grilled sirloin topped with aioli that was as Spanish as a bullfight ; fresh mussels sauteed with sweet peppers ; and fried yucca topped with smothered onions . Mono-dimensionally hot chicken wings - the loser - might have turned up at any microwave festival this side of San Antonio . <p> Spanish-style main courses are outnumbered by Cuban on Mambo 's menu . We were happy with whole red snapper a la Vizcaina - sauteed in garlic and canola oil , topped with sweet peppers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " paella " tasted like the inside of a Cajun pepper grinder ( rather than of the advertised , traditional saffron ) . I gagged down a few terrible bites before losing heart . <p> La Fonda Latina. 1150-B Euclid Ave N.E. ( Enter from parking lot located between Colquitt and Seminole avenues in Little Five Points ) . 577- 8317 . <p> Skillet paella - yellow rice , shrimp , squid and peppers ( $ 10 for two people , $ 5.50 for one ) - is as much fun as the bouncy Latin music and clever outdoor ambience at this back-of-a-store , reverse-chic hangout . <p> Coco Loco . 2625 Piedmont Road N.E. ( facing Sidney Marcus Blvd. ) , 364- 0212. 6301 Roswell Road , 255-5434 . <p> Like Mambo , this two-unit group specializes in Cuban-American fare . The few Spanish items on the menu do not a meal for hungry men make . Paella requires a 60-minute wait , suggesting that the proprietors do n't want to sell much paella . The Basque omelet - shrimp , chorizo and ham - was satisfactory enough for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( rice and black beans cooked together ) and fried plantains . <p> We also tried the Spanish-sounding filete a la Madrilena , a handsome filet mignon that 's breaded , stuffed with lobster meat and sloshed with red sauce . Unfortunately , the steak was insufficiently fried , the lobster unappetizingly raw , the slosh ketchupy . After complaining , we were not charged for this minor abomination . Cuban-style bread was dry and flavorless . Fried squid , considerably outweighed by oily batter , did n't match its tamarind sauce . Our waiter , a reptilian macho type with a mean sense of humor , earned every cent of his $ 2 tip . <p> Don Juan 's Food from Spain . 1927 Piedmont Circle N.E. 874-4285 . <p> Two of us ordered entirely different versions of this old-line restaurant 's five-course , $ 14.95 Spanish feast a couple of weeks ago . We liked the mussels in garlic and wine inordinately , sopping up the sauce with bread . The nine remaining items were wash-outs . <p> Two tables were occupied on this weeknight . The other folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ate fewer courses , however , and stayed a shorter time , so maybe they missed the mussels .
