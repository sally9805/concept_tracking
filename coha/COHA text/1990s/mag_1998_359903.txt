As Ann Lord , 65 , lies withering from cancer , aware that death is near , the memory that floats back is not from any of her three marriages . Rather , it is of Lord 's first love , a passionate affair with a young doctor that lasted only the length of a friend 's weekend wedding festivities . While Lord 's four children maintain a death watch , she relives every minute of that fateful weekend and encounters snippets of memory from other points in her life that flesh out the affair 's consequences . In her powerful third novel Susan Minot mesmerizes with her convincing evocation of Lord 's final semiconscious state , wherein time and place crisscross , the lines between real and imagined blur , and the difference between resignation and regret is indistinguishable . <P>  --  By Jill Smolowe
