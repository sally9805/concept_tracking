Ten short tips on avoiding long shots // SHOOTING LONG AT GAME IS like punting in football : We do it because we 've given up on gaining yards . Granted , sometimes a long shot is the only option , but hunters who become experts at getting close not only earn easier shots , they earn more chances . Here are 10 tips that can help you see more game and improve your odds . Think yourself into a close place . Plan a hunt with the objective not to spot animals but to find one close enough for a sure kill . For me , " close enough " means 30 yards with an arrow or pistol bullet , 80 with a shotgun slug or blackpowder ball and 200 with a centerfire rifle . Of course , you 'll need to glass beyond these limits , but plan on hunting close ; it pulls you from places that afford only a good view and instead puts you where game lives . Make short shooting a priority and soon you 'll discover that animals are popping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantag not only of cover in front , but of backgrounds that swallow your silhouette . Do n't skyline yourself , and match the colors and patterns of your camouflage to the area . Even more important : Animals are hardwired to detect slight movements , so cut out unnecessary motion . When stalking or stillhunting , advance slowly with arms tucked to your torso , and keep leg and head motion to a minimum . Walk briskly between coverts , however . There 's no sense trying to be invisible in the open , and you 'll save time better used for going slow where it counts . Scan the woods thoroughly . While deer and elk sift their surroundings mainly through their noses , humans must depend on their eyes . Look for outof-place shapes and colors , pieces of animals instead of full profiles , flickers of movement and horizontal lines in otherwise vertical woodland backdrops . Look as you move , but stop often to look more carefully . ( Game becomes still when it wants to scrutinize something , because head movement blurs vision . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use binoculars to look close and far-in heavy cover as well as in the open . Divide cover into blocks to glass it more efficiently , and try to keep the binoculars stationary while moving your eyes . I find a 7x35 or 8x42 glass most useful . Photograph THE FIRST RULE of getting close to game is refusing to settle for long shots . Glass from a distance , but then force yourself to hunt through the cover . // Forget about being " silent . " It 's impossible . The best you can do is minimize noise and replace heavy footfalls with sounds imitating those you hear from woodland creatures . Roll your foot forward from a soft heel plant , or tiptoe through crunchy snow , leaves or dry twigs . Avoid clothing with hard synthetic fibers and instead choose wool : It 's quieter and against brush its irregular weave sounds like an animal 's fur . Carry cough drops so you do n't have to clear your throat . When you must talk with a partner , whisper and do it close . Prearranged hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate over distances . Be aware of how air currents will affect your scent . Hunting across wind can be as effective as hunting into it-more so if such an approach also keeps the sun behind you and your feet on game trails . Even if you feel no wind , thermal currents-which generally move uphill on sunny days and downhill at evening-can carry your scent to game . You can reduce your scent somewhat by staying clean and avoiding strong odor-producers like fast food and gasoline . 6 Move like an animal . Traveling on game trails helps you get through thick brush easily and gain or lose elevation efficiently . It also minimizes disturbance , and if you do make noise , at least it comes from a known thoroughfare , where it is least likely to alarm animals . Keep to a woodland pace by pausing at irregular intervals , and move in the same direction game would move .

Humans commonly block out most peripheral sound and movement and miss the crucial clues that could bring a shot . Watch to the side and behind you . Plan your movements at least several yards in advance so you do n't end up retracing your steps . Use wet weather to your advantage . 7 For getting close to big game , there 's nothing better than a light , warm drizzle or soft snowfall-both mean still air ; both cancel thermals so your scent stays close ; both quiet your step and screen your movements ; and both put game at ease and prompt foraging activity outside security cover . The gray skies which accompany light rains also smother your shadow and reduce glare while you glass . High wind or a driving rain can have the opposite effect . But your biggest asset may be a positive attitude : Rainy weather is not always bad weather . Be prepared to shoot . Opportunities can come at any time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's because game loses track of your progress and becomes nervous . So when you stop to glass , always make sure you have shooting lanes . As in boxing , a quick , accurate knockout punch starts with the feet . Shooting off balance places strain on back , arm and shoulder muscles . First they quiver , then they bounce , then you miss . When hunting , always keep the shot in mind so you do n't miss a chance while you position your feet . 9 Take more time to shoot than you think you need . As a guide , I see many shots bungled because they 're taken in a hurry . In point of fact , really urgent shots are rare . You 'll get better results if you deliberately think about what you 're doing . A rifleman 's routine includes checking his torso and head position , sling tension , grip ( is the safety off now ? ) , sight alignment and breathing . You might even touch the trigger lightly , then relax before applying enough pressure to release the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the squeeze smoother the second time . 10 Keep a log to improve your odds on later hunts . Note which tactics worked and which did n't , and how game reacted and why you think it behaved the way it did . Record weather , ground conditions and moon phase . Note times when thermal winds reversed . Draw maps to show vegetation ( include crops ) and game trails . Your sketch will incorporate subtleties commercial maps lack , and will help fix important details in your mind . <p>
