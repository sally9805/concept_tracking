// We handful of people who make nearly all of California 's ultra-premium sparkling gathered last winter for an unusually exhaustive tasting , they surprised even themselves . " No bad wines , " remarked Iron Horse Vineyards ' Forrest Tancer . An astonishingly consistent standard of quality , " agreed Codorniu Napa 's Janet Pagano . Tom Stevenson , the British champagne guru for whose benefit the tasting had been organized , thought the wines ' quality had " quadrupled " since he last tasted the field , in 1991 . Considering that just 25 years ago only two California wineries produced bottlefermented sparkling wine of any kind , that neither of these used Champagne 's classic varietals ( Chardonnay and Pinot Noir ) , and that as recently as the early 1980s many serious California sparkling wines were still lacking in flavor and sophistication , the accomplishments of the last decade are nothing less than dramatic . Bottle-fermented sparkling wines are harder to make and take much longer than table wines . All the challenges of still-wine making are magnified by the delicacy of the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like crystal , " observes S. Anderson winemaker Jac Cole . " You can see right through them to the flaws . " Add the issues associated with the bubbles , the years of waiting while the wine absorbs complex flavors from the detritus of a second fermentation in the bottle , and the final drama of " cleaning " the wine in the bottle , and you have the so-called " champagne method . " Perfected over three centuries in Europe , this technique was imported intact when California winemakers entered the bottle-fermented sparkling-wine business in the 1950s . But until Schramsberg Vineyards began production in the late 1960s , California sparklers , made from Chenin Blanc , Colombard , or Riesling , were really pretty awful . The introduction of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir as the grapes of choice enabled California 's first great leap forward . Following Schramsberg 's success , the great French Champagne houses and Spanish cava producers set up shop in the Golden State , and a tiny band of dedicated , bubble-loving winemakers established the boutique brands that have become synonymous with quality here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic elements of fine sparkling wine got sorted out in California . Delicate fruit grown in the cooler microclimates of Mendocino , Sonoma , Carneros , and Arroyo Grande was picked at higher acidity and lower sugar . ( Good sparkling wine can not be made from the superripe , high-sugar grapes prized for rich , fruity Chardonnay . ) The wines spent more time on yeast lees than even Champagne itself , to accommodate the exuberant quality of California fruit , and they were assembled with a wide palette of base wines . Those wines were themselves made from delicately pressed whole grapes whose juice was given little or no skin contact during fermentation . By the mid-1980s many California sparklers were not bad at all . But late in that decade there was another great leap forward . Shifting their attention from the winery to the vineyard , sparkling-wine makers recognized that grapes ' physiological maturity-a matter of chemical balance and flavor-was as important as their measurable sugar . Perfect sugar did not guarantee flavor , and nothing done to flavorless grapes after they arrived at the winery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by taste rather than formula and to respect hang time ( the principal governor of physiological maturity ) . they were liberated from the bondage of " tart-dumbsweet " wines-tart and/or dumb because the grapes were picked before they were ripe or mature , and sweet because sugar was added after the second fermentation to compensate . Now California 's sparkling-wine makers are free to focus on wine types and wine styles . Types include brutdry wines made from a blend of red and white grapes ; blanc de noirs from Pinot Noir ; blanc de blancs from Chardonnay ; dry rose tinted with a small amount of still red wine ; and slightly sweet wines called cremant or demi-sec . Some winemakers think that the greatest stylistic differences are regional ; for others , house style is now the dominant variable . A WINE TO MATCH MANY MENUS , ALL YEAR LONG Four-fifths of all sparkling-wine sales worldwide take place in November and December of each year . Since consumers are willing to pay a premium when they celebrate , they 've supported the high prices that French Champagne has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. producers have assumed in trying to develop the domestic market , they would n't be surprised to find California sparklers equally pricey . After all , sparkling-wine makers are in competition for the same fine Chardonnay and Pinot Noir that makers of still wines now find in short supply . ( In fact , bottle for bottle they need more of it , since roughly 30 percent more fruit is crushed for a bottle of sparkling wine than for any still wine . ) And costs mount from there : Special manual and mechanical processes are required to manage bubbles . Holding bottled wine in the cellar for two to five years generates monstrous inventory costs . The sparkling-wine package costs more to produce , the heavier bottle costs more to ship , and the federal government , in its wisdom , taxes sparkling wine at a 400-percent premium ! But largely owing to overcapacity and somewhat lethargic demand , California 's best bottle-fermented sparkling wines are currently nothing less than phenomenal bargains . At the end of the day , though sparkling wines may cost 50 to 75 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much lower prices than top Chardonnays . Perhaps it 's sparkling wine 's traditional association with luxury that encourages the belief that it complements vanilla . Attractive complement to smoked salmon . Iron Horse Brut 1991 ( $22 ) . A bright , bone-dry , racy , well-structured wine with cascading layers of fruit flavors . Preponderantly Pinot Noir ; 41/2 years on the yeast . Very good with sushi and sashimi , especially toro and maguro . S. Anderson Brut 1991 ( $23 ) . A creamy , yeasty , symphonic wine , with aromas of pear blossom and green apple ; four years on the yeast . " You can taste the well-made base wine underneath , " said one panelist . This wine goes especially well with food . S. Anderson Blanc de Noirs 1992 ( $23 ) . Flavors of toasted bread , cherry , and cassis , with a creamy finish . 100 percent Pinot Noir ; 42 months on the yeast . Good with stuffed mushrooms or cheese souffle . Schramsberg Blanc de Noirs 1988 ( $24.50 ) . Toasted nuts on the nose ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , mature wine ( a blend of Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier ) is beautiful with turkey , veal , game , and ( we were delighted to find ) cold roast pork tenderloin . Domaine Chandon Brut " Etoile " ( $25 ) . This fifth release of the special " Etoile " cuvee is based predominantly on the 1990 vintage . Four years on the yeast , it is marked by peach and apple flavors . A well-balanced wine that one of our panelists characterized as " proud . " Especially recommended with unctuous dishes such as scallops and foie gras . Iron Horse Brut Rose 1991 ( S26 ) . <p>
