U.S. Business and the Embargo <p> By the end of 1995 , the private jet hangar at Jose Marti International Airport in Havana was already booked well into 1996 , and most of the reservations belonged to one of Cuba 's rare clienteles : American corporations . Chief executives on familiarization trips and technical analysts on fact-finding missions have been scouting for numerous prominent and curious firms , including General Motors , Sears Roebuck , Avis , Hyatt , ITT Sheraton , Bank of Boston , Gillette , and Radisson Hotels . Increasingly , these firms like what they see of the Cuban economy and grouse openly at what they are being denied by the U.S. embargo . " The embargo is a waste of taxpayer dollars and time , " said James E. Perrella , CEO of construction giant Ingersoll-Rand , after a November meeting with Cuban President Fidel Castro . Perrella , recently named chairman of the 500-corporate-member National Foreign Trade Council , is echoed by a growing number of Fortune 500 companies . Dwayne O. Andreas , chairman of Archer Daniels Midland , claims not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business is a good idea , particularly when all of Western Europe is down there . Corporate leaders are lobbying the president and his advisers , as well as key members of Congress , every chance they get . " The question is whether American business will be able to organize well enough to go beyond the quiet lobbying efforts of individual corporate leaders and loosen or end the embargo . A TAJ MAHAL FOR HAVANA <p> Even owners of some of the largest hotels and resorts in Florida , which is home to many fervently anti-Castro Cuban exiles , are calling for change . Peter Blyth , president of the Radisson Hotel chain , which has more than 4,000 travel agencies worldwide including southern Florida , is ready to invest and frustrated at being blocked . " We 've got three hotel sites chosen , a TGI Friday 's location in Havana picked , and cruise ships waiting for the green light . There is pent-up demand because Cuba is a substantial market for American businesses , and most of our colleagues on Wall Street feel the same way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business lobby to lift the embargo is in motion . " It 's like an avalanche in the snow , " says Andreas . " You wo n't really know its coming until it 's on top of you and it 's too late . But the lobby is there , and it 's gaining steam . " Real estate and casino mogul Donald Trump says , " The people of Cuba are the greatest in the world . I 'd like to help them rebuild the country and return it to its original splendor . And as soon as the law changes , I am ready to build the Taj Mahal in Havana . " At the same time , advocates of a repeal worry that U.S. business may already be too late . Corporate lawyer and veteran Cuba hand Theodore C. Sorenson says , " When all the walls come down , they 'll discover their foreign competitors are already there . " <p> Despite the improved prospects for investment , several business groups are still adamantly opposed to doing any U.S. business in Cuba . Tom Cox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard line : " It 's throwing Castro a lifeline , plain and simple . " But Cox says that although the council has a laundry list of preconditions for endorsing invest-ment  --  establishment of a free-enterprise economy , enforcement of contracts , and protection for and expansion of private property  --  " Castro leaving the scene is not required . " Some of Cox 's corporate members are starting to equivocate and break ranks with the council on the embargo issue . One member asked , " Is n't there something between dancing with a dictator and sitting passively by while the Europeans invest ? We 're corporate America . Why are n't we calling the shots ? " President Clinton 's former Treasury secretary , Lloyd Bentsen , recently surprised some observers by voicing strong pro-investment sentiments at a convention in Toronto . <p> The hard line against doing any business with Cuba under Castro is still orthodoxy for many influential Cuban exiles . Their activism deters some businessmen , who fear domestic retaliation , but less than in the past . Threats of boycotts or worse by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is broken most often by exile families sending money to relatives . A spokesman for Radisson Hotels says that it has not received any pressure and that Cuban Americans in Dade County are its best customers . Benetton , the Italian multinational clothing company , did face a protest by Cuban exiles but claims it lasted for a day in front of their Dadeland store and ceased once company officials met with the protesters . " It 's a paper tiger , " says John Kavulich , president of the U.S.-Cuban Trade and Economic Council . " Buyer-beware cables and boycott threats have produced no major obstacle to free marketeers . " <p> From the all-or-nothing shouting match of the last 30 years , the debate on doing business with Cuba appears to be shifting to terms and conditions . The underlying question is how much change can occur before Castro leaves power . A CHANGING SCENE <p> Several forces are nudging American business to go public in lobbying against the embargo . Cuba in the last two years has gradually opened its economy to allow the sale of some state-owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see European , Mexican , Canadian , and Japanese firms starting to make serious investments there . American business executives worry that non-U.S . firms may box them out , particularly in industrial and telecommunications areas of the economy . Several U.S. corporations with major claims on property expropriated by the Castro government argue that legislation currently before Congress to tighten the embargo endangers their claims . Lastly , the immigration accords between the U.S. and Cuban governments have cooled the political atmosphere by inhibiting migration and underscoring the fact that , as far as U.S. policy is concerned , Cuba 's emigrants are primarily economic refugees . <p> The initiatives of the Cuban government have raised expectations on Wall Street and in corporate America of short-term profits once the embargo eases or ends , and that has been reflected in accelerated preparations . Cuban economic officials met with over 1,300 U.S. executives and signed some 40 nonbinding letters of intent to do business , including several million-dollar-plus commitments , in 1995 alone . One such commitment by an investment consortium is valued at $10 billion , according to Kavulvich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels , is valued at $2 billion , according to Cuba 's tourism ministry . Some observers , however , deeply discount or dismiss these initiatives because of their nonbinding status . <p> Even with the embargo , American business has some presence in Cuba . Current U.S. law allows American businesses with special licenses to operate there in telecommunications , publishing , cultural programs , newsgathering , credit card processing for certain transactions , travel bookings , humanitarian projects , and limited types of medical and pharmaceutical sales . U.S. law also allows American businesses to purchase a noncontrolling minority interest in a foreign company doing business in Cuba , except for cases in which the company has a separate division dedicated solely to Cuban work . <p> American products can also be found throughout Cuba , particularly in Havana . Coca-Cola is readily available , which was not the case six months ago . California wines have recently appeared at the restaurant of the Hotel Nacional in Havana . These products are for the most part sold through unauthorized distribution networks in Panama and other countries . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parent corporations are . " No one sells that much Coca-Cola to Panama without knowing where it is going , " says Julio Ignacio , a Cuban spirits distributor . " It is sold with a wink and a nod . " <p> Meanwhile , the pace of non-U.S . foreign investment in Cuba quickens , despite the country 's political risks . Canada 's Sherritt International last year issued a $500 million stock offering to broaden its Cuban holdings in sugar , transportation , communications , and real estate . In three weeks ' time , it was fully subscribed . In large part , the investment surge is due to a widespread belief that in the not-too-distant future the United States will loosen or lift the embargo . " We are here for three to five years and we expect to be bought out by the Americans , " confided Mario Panunci , whose Italian investment banking firm financed the Fiat dealership in Havana . " We put more money in than we can get out , but who cares ? We know you 're going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it . It is just a matter of time . " <p> A concern that looms large for American businesses is whether opportunities for capital investment and market entry will be arbitrarily curtailed by Cuba 's government , which is still authoritarian and communist . On several occasions Castro has voiced grudging sentiments about the opening of the Cuban economy . In his December speech to the National Assembly , Castro reiterated his belief that " under capitalism , the interests of the people and the interests of the nation do not coincide . It is only under socialism that the nation 's interests and those of the people coincide . " Nevertheless , Castro apparently finds some solace in tax levies that assure the state an ample slice of new business profits . <p> Countering Castro 's personal reluctance are pressures from key segments of society , including younger public officials and factions within the military . Although the hemorrhaging of the early post-Soviet years is over , Cubans recognize that their economy is still fragile . Thus official nervousness is constant and focuses on the new need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous sugar harvest  --  the lowest since pre-revolutionary days  --  frightened investors and sobered Cubans who had started to believe that the economy was looking up . Record low sugar production has been a problem , and the decrease in sugar production resulted in a trade deficit worse than 1994 's . <p> " Tourism will be our future , " Castro declared in his speech . " Nowadays tourism brings in more gross income than sugar . " Indeed , tourism is attracting much of the attention from foreign investors ; hotels are at 90 percent capacity and higher in Havana , Varadero , and Santiago de Cuba . The biggest investors in joint ventures with Cubanacan , one of Cuba 's tourism agencies , are Spain , the Netherlands , Canada , Colombia , Germany , and Jamaica . Cuba 's Ministry of Tourism , while perhaps relying on ventures that could turn Cuba into an overcrowded tourist mecca , projects an increase to 50,000 hotel rooms in the year 2000 , from the current 23,000 . Whether those goals can be met is debatable , but the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduling of direct flights from Helsinki and Dusseldorf . STEP BY STEP <p> The Cuban government is well aware that the Clinton administration 's foreign policy team is predisposed to opening the door slowly , and it has scant expectation that any large steps will occur before the American presidential election of 1996 . The Clinton administration is conducting an interagency review , as required by law , of U.S.-Cuba telecommunications policy that will consider allowing U.S. companies to invest in the multibillion-dollar privatization of Cuba 's telephone sytem . A reasonable interpretation of current law could find such a proposal allowable , but the betting is against approval of a sweeping , direct U.S. investment in an election year . Nonetheless , the Mexican company involved in the deal sent lobbyists to Capitol Hill to seek approval for AT &T; to become a partner in the venture . Dwayne Andreas , thinks he knows what will happen if Clinton is reelected . " Clinton will certainly move toward lifting the embargo , and the Cubans are counting on it . " <p> The modest liberalization steps that Clinton has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which include establishing people-to-people contact to promote democratic reform in Cuba . On October 6 , the Clinton administration allowed U.S. news bureaus to set up shop in Cuba ; authorized Western Union to open offices in Havana , American companies to register patents of their products ( for example , Coca-Cola or Kleenex ) in Cuba , and U.S. foundations and nongovernmental organizations to establish exchange programs ; and expanded the humanitarian relief and family remittances allowed under U.S. law . U.S. government officials privately concede that under the new regulations  --  particularly those applying to humanitarian donations  --  American corporations can do a lot to establish a market presence . Last year , for instance , Angel R. Martinez , the president of a Reebok subsidiary and a Cuban-American , delivered 5,000 pairs of donated Reebok sneakers to Cuba through a special license , purchasing some product name recognition along with good will . <p> Initiatives , even if only preparatory , are bubbling up from other quarters . One such effort is a set of investment guidelines for U.S. corporations , much like the Sullivan principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The guidelines were written by two Cuban exiles : Rolando H. Castaneda , an Inter-American Development Bank senior operations officer , and George Plinio Montalvan , the former chief economist of the Organization of American States . The guidelines propose fair labor requirements , such as direct hiring of Cubans rather than through a state agency , a 48-hour limit to the workweek , the organization of independent unions , and equal access for Cubans to beaches and restaurants . The authors also proposed to end the U.S.-led ban on Cuba 's admission to the International Monetary Fund , provided Cuba implements market-based reforms . They call for the United States to unilaterally lift the ban on the commercial sale of food to Cuba ; the rest of the trade embargo would be lifted when Cuba releases its political prisoners and agrees to abide by international human rights conventions . Their proposal for the resolution of claims on expropriated properties is compensation rather than restitution . <p> " The business community is not trying to be insensitive to the heartache of the exile community , " says Radisson Hotel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among them many Cuban Americans , who are asking us to move things forward because there is a generational change , and the grandparents of the exile community are all elderly . " Other executives privately voice similar views , saying that the U.S. business community has been a force for democratic change in other countries in the past . In this case , corporate America will have to work with the exile community to advance its agenda and gain full access to the Cuban market . <p> EDITOR 'S NOTE : For an assessment of conditions in Cuba and an analysis of U.S.  --  Cuban relations , see " Cuba 's Long Reform , " by Wayne S.
