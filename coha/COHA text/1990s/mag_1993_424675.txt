The nation 's largest insurer of the elderly could add a few benefits and save a few billion <p> It 's time for a health care quiz . If you were in charge of the largest health insurer of the nation 's elderly would you : <p> A ) Pay enormous charges for unnecessary and avoidable procedures and hospital stays , thereby incurring one of the largest drags on the nation 's deficit , or <p> B ) Fund proven , less expensive options that can prevent extended illnesses , thereby reducing the cost to senior citizens and taxpayers ? <p> If you picked B , do n't quit your day job . <p> But if you picked A , congratulations , you may have a career waiting for you in the Health Care Financing Administration ( HCFA ) , the organization that administers Medicare . <p> And that 's the problem , for as HCFA and Congress grope for ways to reduce costs in the Medicare system , they see only the simplest and , ironically , the most harmful cures . Congress thinks only in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness of the health care crisis , they say , justifies the austerity of these measures . But times of emergency require more than mere draconian budget cutting ; they require creativity . <p> Preventing serious illness-instead of waiting until expensive treatments are necessary  --  or offering alternatives to unnecessary procedures and hospitalizations can actually save HCFA money . It 's a paradox that both politicians and the elderly can learn to love : By adding benefits , you can increase the health of America 's senior citizens while slowing the meteoric rise of the Medicare budget . Increase funding of home health care . <p> " People are almost always happier in the home , and we would like to keep them there , " says Joanne Schwartzberg , director of geriatric health at the American Medical Association . " We just have n't figured out a way to do that yet . " The obstacle , however , is n't a lack of medical knowledge ; the obstacle is HCFA . Although patients are more comfortable at home , and home health care is overwhelmingly cheaper than equivalent hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals . The health benefits alone should be enough to encourage HCFA to increase its home care coverage , but since it is not , consider some of the economic advantages : According to a study by Lewin/ICF , a patient recuperating from a hip fracture at home incurs $2,300 less in medical costs than one who stayed in a hospital . These savings , multiplied by the approximately 250,000 hip fractures per year , could put Medicare 's savings into the hundreds of millions . The same study found a $520 per case savings for victims of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . At nearly 95,000 cases per year , that comes to an additional $48 million savings . By treating catastrophic accident victims at home , an Aetna Life &; Casualty study found , Medicare could realize $78,000 per case savings . <p> Approximately one-third of all home care costs come out of recipients ' pockets , so it raises an eyebrow when Medicare says it pays " for all medically necessary home health services . " Although there is an overall cost benefit for choosing home health care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than hospital care . The heaviest burden , predictably , falls on those with the lowest incomes who can not afford supplementary insurance . <p> In spite of the overall savings , Medicare refuses to pay for things in the home-like special meals  --  that it pays inflated rates for in a hospital . As a result , patients face the following dilemma : receive care at home at added cost and burden to themselves and their family , or stay in the hospital and have everything but the deductible paid for by Medicare . <p> Fortunately , much of the apparatus for funding home health care is already in place . The interpretation of what constitutes " medically necessary " services , however , must be greatly relaxed . For instance , while Medicare will pay for wheelchairs and adjustable beds , it wo n't pay for the device that enables a patient to move from one to the other because that , in this screwy logic , is a " convenience item . " Medicare will reimburse for primary dressings , such as gauze , but not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gauze in place . Says Schwartzberg : " This is the strange , Alice-in-Wonderland sort of world Medicare is in . " <p> There is yet another obstacle to patients receiving care at home : Doctors do n't feel it 's in their interest to prescribe home care . And why should they ? Many of the services doctors provide to home patients , such as phone consultations , are n't paid for , and those that are invariably are under-reimbursed . In spite of recent increases in reimbursement rates , a physician still receives an average $50 for a house call . It costs $90 to get a plumber to come fix your toilet . For doctors , the question is just as simple as for patients : Either prescribe home care , which provides little reimbursement for services , or keep patients in a hospital , where everything is paid for at a higher rate . <p> So simply by increasing reimbursement rates , and loosening regulations on what equipment and services are considered " medically necessary , " HCFA could redirect the flow away from hospitals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Implement a home visit program for all Medicare beneficiaries over the age of 75 , including those who are healthy . <p> Geriatricians at the UCLA School of Medicine conducted a test of over 400 Medicare beneficiaries over the age of 75 . Every three months , a geriatric nurse visited the participants ' homes , most of whom were active and relatively healthy , and took a comprehensive health survey . The nurse conducted a physical examination , a home-safety evaluation , and made sure prescribed care and medicine were taken properly . The nurse corrected any dangerous practices , advised the elderly on nutrition and exercise , and reported potential problems to the patient 's physician . The cost of the visits was less than $500 per year . <p> And worth every penny . After the very first year , patients receiving the care were markedly healthier than an untreated control group . The study found that while the patients were not less likely to be admitted to a hospital , the length of stay was reduced from an average 12.2 to 9.6 days . Considering that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to almost $3,000 saved in hospitalization alone . Furthermore , someone receiving the service was five times less likely to check into a nursing home . The reason for the success : The nurse 's visits helped the patient and the physician tailor the care to the patient 's health problems . The number of visits to the doctor was not significantly reduced ; however , patients made fewer unnecessary trips , and the ones they made actually improved their health . <p> For HCFA to include these benefits in the Medicare package would require an about-face not seen since the program started in 1965 . In HCFA 's defense , there was less to prevent back then . Most people simply did n't live long past 65 . But currently , someone who reaches 65 can expect to live another 15 to 20 years . And research has shown that even the simplest preventive care , such as exercise , can have a tangible effect on the well-being of people as old as 90 . <p> Research notwithstanding , HCFA may still reject adding preventive care measures . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demonstrate in the short-term that preventive services are cost-effective , " says Dr. Donald Patrick , who designed HCFA 's preventive care research test at the University of North Carolina . The problem is that many will produce their most significant benefits later than Congress is willing to wait . <p> What HCFA may do is suggest doctors perform some of the services the nurses provided , only in their offices instead of at home . Doctors could talk about benefits of proper nutrition , exercise , and taking prescribed drugs just as well or better than a nurse , the logic goes . This would do minimal good , however , according to Dr. Andrea Steiner , evaluative coordinator for the UCLA project . " We found that the most valuable component was the nurse visits . Being in the person 's home and seeing how they lived was far more valuable than any answer the person could give in a doctor 's office . " <p> This direction would be a radical departure from the normal Medicare program , though such programs are becoming increasingly common . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reimburse heart patients participating in preventive care programs , and Blue Cross/Blue Shield is expected to follow . In addition , Canada , Germany , and Australia all sponsor some form of preventive care . In the meantime Medicare is letting 1965 's medical knowledge dictate the care for 1993 's elderly . Extend coverage of prescribed Medicine to senior citizens below the poverty line . <p> How 's this for logic : Medicare will pay $40,000 for the expenses of a heart attack , but it wo n't pay the $1,200 for the medicine that would have prevented it . Nor will it pay for the $1,000 drug treatment that prevents $25,000 ulcer surgery , or the $1,300 in drug therapy that would make $8,400 in hospitalization for chemotherapy-induced anemia unnecessary . <p> Get the idea ? <p> Medicare has never covered prescription drugs . But since the mid-sixties , researchers have discovered medicines that can help prevent major health problems or take the place of surgery once such problems occur . " One day in the hospital is $1,000 , " says Dr. Bruce Garret , a Washington D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Medicine is what keeps people out of the hospital . " Not only does it keep people out , it shortens their stay if they must be hospitalized . Canada , for instance , covers prescription drugs in its national health plan , and as a result , hospital stays are on average shorter than in the United States . <p> The most important thing to know about medicine is that it does n't work if you do n't take it . As obvious as this sounds , many elderly do not take their full prescriptions because they simply ca n't afford to . Senior citizens are the group in the country least likely to have coverage for their prescription medicine ( only 36 percent ) . At the same time , they are far and away the most frequent users . A person under treatment for more than one condition can pay as much as $300 per month for medicine . So there are two options : Either do n't take the medicine and wait for the inevitable complication to take you to a hospital , or take only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's sufficient . Either will likely land you in a hospital , but that 's okay , because Medicare covers hospitalization , including any drugs prescribed while you are there . Drug money <p> What makes Medicare 's drug restrictions more nonsensical is that drugs , while still overpriced , have increased in cost at just over half the rate of health care in general . So what is HCFA 's problem ? HCFA worries that if it insured prescriptions , there would be nothing to keep doctors from wildly prescribing medicine without any concern about the cost . Considering that American doctors are not renowned for restraint , HCFA could have a point . So here is a compromise : extend Medicare coverage to the most vulnerable recipients . A proposed health reform bill sponsored by Representatives Richard Gephardt ( D-MO ) and Pete Stark ( D-CA ) would guarantee drug coverage to all elderly below the poverty line . Since the chief savings would come from those who would not be able to afford their full prescription otherwise , Medicare should adopt this Gephardt-Stark proposal and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is one of the few times that the morally and financially right choices coincide . <p> In many respects , Medicare is doing an excellent job . It 's one of the most efficient health insurance providers in the country . About 2 percent of Medicare 's total budget is spent on administrative costs , versus 10 percent for Blue Cross/Blue Shield and over 15 percent for Mutual of Omaha . <p> But for the past quarter century , Medicare has been working on the Boy Scout principle : When an old lady gets to the street corner , help her across , and then let her go on her way . Today , however , there are too many street corners and too many old ladies to make this work . If Medicare is to succeed , it must realize that it is far more rewarding , and in many cases less costly , to ensure that the old lady can cross each street by herself . <p> by Daniel Franklin <p> <p> Daniel Franklin is an intern at The Washington Monthly . <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
