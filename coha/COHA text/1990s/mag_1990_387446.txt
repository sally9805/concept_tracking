<p> Westerners like to think of Lech Walesa in richly heroic terms . His earthy common sense and political courage epitomized the virtues that helped Poland make its tortuous journey away from communism in the 1980s . He was the shipyard rebel who called the bluff of Soviet bloc authoritarianism ; the pious dissident who endured house arrest under Poland 's martial law ; the authentic proletarian who brokered the 1989 bargaining that led to the first non-Communist government of Eastern Europe since the aftermath of World War II ; the Nobel Prize winner who won an ovation from the Congress of the United States when he movingly described Poland 's debt to the principles of American democracy . <p> Here in Poland , however , the Solidarity chief has come to be seen in a somewhat more ambiguous light . In the past year Walesa has been quoted as saying that if Germany destabilizes Europe , it can be " wiped off the map . " He answered a question about Jews seeking public office in Poland by saying they should make their ethnic origins known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if elected president , and rule by decree if necessary . Rare indeed are the weeks without apologies and clarifications from Solidarity headquarters in Gdansk . Increasingly people are asking whether this former electrician is qualified to be president of the new republic . Some are saying that Poland 's frail democracy may not withstand Walesa 's autocratic impulses . <p> On the surface , a personal change is clear . The wiry shipyard worker who wore boxy polyester suits and ankle-length socks is now a portly 47-year-old who favors well-tailored worsted suits with hand-finished lapels . For campaigning , Walesa wears khakis , white-button-down shirts , and a gold chain around his neck . The only vestige of his former attire is the ever-present pin of the Black Madonna of Czestochowa , the patron saint of Poland . At the time of the shipyard strike , Walesa did n't even have a car . ( He 'd gotten rid of his old Warszawa , a classic East bloc clunker . ) Not long after the birth of Solidarity came a Volkswagen bus . He now owns a white nine-seater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight children , and his wife , Danuta , to their A-frame dacha in the Kazubian forest . But most of the time Walesa uses a Lancia with driver , courtesy of the government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki . <p> It is tempting to say that fame has spoiled Lech Walesa . When crossed , he is peevish and self-aggrandizing . Last spring , before the campaign got under way , Walesa was in Warsaw for a meeting of the citizens committees to thrash out differences about how to organize politics in Poland . The group was waiting for the arrival of Walesa 's old friend and now presidential rival , Mozowiecki . " But the prime minister a watch ; he was supposed to be here at half past , " Walesa snapped . Piqued still when the prime minister arrived , he chided : " You are twenty minutes late . " Mazowiecki simply turned his long , drawn face toward heaven . <p> There are occasions , though , when Walesa displays an infectious , self-deprecating charm . " Were I in the United States I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one interview , his voice dipping up and down animatedly . " Because there are better politicians there . But here in Poland instead of putting bulbs into sockets I 'm doing what I 'm doing . " He chortled . This is the Walesa who can go to the coal mines or to a farmers ' sit-in and defuse anger . It 's a gift few Polish politicians possess . " He is the blood and bones of this peasant society , " says the writer Ryszard Kapuscinski , not as an endorsement but as a statement of fact . <p> Walesa grew up on a farm , was educated at trade school , and worked as an electrician at the shipyards . This background gives him a distinct advantage in an election that will be decided by ordinary people . He is an intuitive master of mass opinion , skilled at taking disparate popular sentiments and weaving them into daily pronouncements . For most people in Poland , each day is a struggle to afford basics like meat and toilet paper . Walesa gives voice to anxieties that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean a better life anytime soon . During his campaign he called for a kielbasa in every pot , suggesting at one rally that the government stake each Pole 100 million zloties  --  $10,000  --  so everyone could buy shares in newly privatized industries . He addresses the problem of apathy and mistrust , declaring he must wage a " political war " because he is in " deadly fear " of a new power monopoly . He urges the routing of Communists still holding posts , and wants Poland 's pace of change " accelerated . " <p> Walesa 's populism sometimes lapses into demagoguery . He talks cavalierly of shielding workers from the full blow of economic austerity but at the same time pledges support for the free market . With the fervor of a George Wallace he fans the anger of ordinary people against the " jajo glowy " ( eggheads ) . In speech after speech Walesa equates himself with the nation  --  " I am the chief of Poland 's reforms . " There are also Napoleonic touches , such as the tendency to speak about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tired , Lech Walesa wants to go home . " ) Most of Walesa 's handlers have given up trying to change him now . " Lech is Lech , " is a common , resigned refrain . <p> It is perhaps not surprising , then , that many Polish liberals cringe when they hear Walesa exalt the working class . They accuse him of becoming a kind of Slavic Juan Peron . Walesa hates the allusion to the Argentine dictator , but he defends his position with a line that would have made Peron proud . He says he is simply a spokesman for the people : " I speak what the masses feel.The masses release all their anger through me . " <p> The split between Walesa and the Solidarity liberals began right after the final unraveling of communism in Poland during the summer of 1989 . That spring the Round Table negotiations had secured the first semi-democratic elections in the Soviet bloc since the 1940s . The opposition 's resounding electoral victory left the Communist Party a shambles . Solidarity , featuring a power vacuum , sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Solidarity , the premiership . Walesa happily played kingmaker , choosing Mazowiecki , his longtime adviser , as prime minister . His other close adviser , Bronislaw Germek , took a powerful post as chairman of the Citizens ' Parliamentary Club , composed of Solidarity deputies . General Wojciech Jaruzelski , who had imposed martial law and temporarily snuffed out Solidarity , became president . <p> Walesa returned to Gdansk to run the union , but doubtless also expected to play a major role in the new government . Months went by . No invitations from Mazowiecki arrived . By January Walesa was criticizing what he called the government 's slow pace of change . Tensions mounted over control of the national citizens committees , first created at election time to back Solidarity candidates . Mazowiecki implored : " Please , do n't let us turn this beginning of Polish democracy into hell , the Polish hell of quarrels , rivalries , and fights . " But the cross fire continued . At a Vienna conference writer Adam Michnik said Walesa 's thinking reminded him of " ein Volk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " war at the top , " announcing his presidential bid and accusing Mazowiecki of delaying democratization and grasping for power without a popular mandate . " People are forgetting very fast , " he said in an interview . " I was the one who crafted Solidarity . Now Mazowiecki and Geremek want me to lose my influence . It is a swindle  --  pure and simple . " <p> Walesa was not the only one with grievances . Although many Solidarity luminaries made it to the top echelons of government , others from the union hierarchy , especially provincial operatives and Walesa loyalists in Gdansk , sat on the sidelines . Walesa reasserted his power by appointing an ally , Jaroslaw Kaczynski , as the editor of the Solidarity weekly . The paper 's top editors resigned in protest , calling the decision undemocratic . But Kaczynski says , " The real reason they did n't want me was that I was n't from the right circles . " <p> " The right circles " means , of course , the opposition elite of Warsaw and Krakow  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multilingual and urbane , who became Solidarity 's brain trust . It may seem odd that Kaczynski , a law professor at Warsaw University and veteran opposition figure , should feel like an outcast . But his attitude reflects a common mood . With the loss of the Communist enemy as a unifying force , many of the old fault lines in Polish society are reappearing . City people complain about the peasants , who , they claim , cry poverty but make profits selling hoarded goods when shortages drive up prices . Provincial Poland thinks Warsaw and Krakow have to much power . Many salaried Poles are nettled by the new moneyed class of entrepreneurs . An old enemy , the Jew , has been revived even though Jewish population in Poland today is almost nonexistent . An incident at a steel mill rally for Walesa shows how volatile the problem has become . Young anarchists arrived shouting , " Down with Walesa , " and workers defending their candidate beat up the protesters . A year ago the two groups would have shouted in unison : " Down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The end of the summer of 1990 two distinct political groups had emerged : Center Alliance , a right-center political coalition , and the pro-government Civic Movement for Democratic Action , which has been given an English acronym  --  ROAD  --  by its founders . Wladyslaw Frasyniuk , one leader , said at a founding meeting : " As our name indicates , we are neither left nor right , but a ROAD to Europe . " The acronym has sparked grousing that the group is elitist : many Poles facetiously call them " drogowcy " : road maintenance workers . Center Alliance was formed in the spring of 1990 ; its aim was to get Walesa elected president . It says it wants a modern , Western market economy in Poland . Center Alliance also wants a quick purge of the old nomenklatura , many ex-members of which have held on to their old jobs . ROAD is equally committed to the idea of a free market , but is less aggressive in its pursuit of remnants of the old regime . ROADers admit there 's still a problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party hacks , fearing political instability . <p> The two parties are also distinguished by their rhetoric . Kaczynski , a leader of Center Alliance , sees his opponents as " hypocritical about tradition " because they prefer the " expression society ' to nation ' . " Quite often , he says , " They put in opposition Poland and Europe : Poland is backward and xenophobic ; and Europe is everything positive , modern , and so on . This left formation has fears about the traditional folk peasant way of believing and the traditional religious way of behaving . We have no such fear . " ROAD , in turn , warns against the " empty populism " of Center Alliance . Zbigniew Bujak , a founder of ROAD and a former Solidarity leader , says the Center Alliance is a magnet for nationalists . " Because of this nationalistic point of view , they are n't able to build a political movement that connects Poland to the West . ROAD will be the party which brings Poland to Europe . " <p> The ranks of ROAD are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellectuals now criticizing Walesa were once eager to be his teacher . In the first heady months of Solidarity , professors named their babies Lech . Today some of the same people talk of emigrating if Walsea becomes president . When they worry about the future shape of Poland , they allude to ciemnogrod , a term used in Poland since the nineteenth century meaning " city of darkness , " a place where backwardness and superstition reign . Many Poles are already alarmed by recent decisions to reintroduce religion in the classroom and to limit women 's access to abortion . ( An outright ban on abortion is now before Poland 's Parliament . ) At best , they see Walesa as a sort of latter-day Chauncey Gardiner , the sweet idiot-hero of Jerzy Kosinski 's Being There , ' whose pronouncements sound refreshingly wise but are actually perfectly empty . There is a barely disguised subtext to this : the Czechs have the enlightened Havel , the Hungarians the sophisticated Antall ; and we have  --  well , an electrician . <p> As election day gets closer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solidarity headquarters in Gdansk , more than a hundred letters pour in for him each day . When the journalist Andrzej Wroblewski spoke out against Walesa on his television talk show , he got an avalanche of mail , for and against . A schoolteacher complained : Why do you mock the nation  --  meaning Walesa , who is the nation ? ' A viewer from western Poland wrote : Those pushing Walesa 's candidacy must have lost their minds . A man with two years of electrician 's school . ' Another fulminated : Mr. Wroblewski , you are either a Jew or a hypocrite . To say something straight you 'd have to be a great man like Walesa . We have enough of our own people and we do n't need Jews to govern us . " <p> Walesa has publicly dissociated himself from ethnic slurs . But asked if he thought ROAD was a Jewish party , Walesa replied that Jews should n't conceal their roots . " I want to clear this up anew , so that there would be no anti-Jewish graffiti , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they provoke attitudes of anti-Semitism . Why are Jews not proud of the fact that they are Jewish ? I am proud of the fact that I am Polish . We extricated ourselves from communism , which treated anti-Semitism as a tool . One should speak about this in order to eliminate this . " Walesa says he is shocked by the uproar that followed . He recalls his role in successfully nominating the Israeli writer and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel for the Nobel Peace Prize , and notes that he accompanied Wiesel on an emotional visit to Auschwitz . <p> But Walesa is n't prone to make painstaking rebuttals . " I do n't wish for anyone to write that I am a populist or an anti-Semite , " he instructed journalists recently . This bombast is not simply a personal idiosyncrasy . It recalls old themes in Polish history . Some have even compared Walesa 's style to that of Josef Pilsudski , Poland 's leader between the two world wars , and the comparison is too close to dismiss entirely . General Pilsudski too was a Polish hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He led his country to independence and at first encouraged democracy . After stepping down from power , however , he launched a coup d'etat and presided over a " directed democracy , " stopping just short of dictatorship . Walesa has two bronzes of Pilsudski , one at the office and one at home . <p> By Victoria Pope <p>
