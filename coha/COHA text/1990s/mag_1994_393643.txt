What would the world do without tea ? " the English essayist Sydney Smith wrote in the early 1800s . The same question might well apply to the teapot , for 500 years an object of fascination , a symbol of ritual and refinement , gentility and warmth . Now more than ever , this curious composite of belly , handle , lid and spout is thriving as art medium and collectible , with an explosion of gallery exhibitions devoted to it . The San Francisco art dealer Dorothy Weiss , for one , featured a dozen artists in her first teapot invitational a few years ago . The show has since doubled in size , and Weiss has sensed the emergence of an increasing number of collectors whose focus is the teapot . The annual " Tea Party " at the Ferrin Gallery in Northampton , Massachusetts , has grown from a handful of makers in 1979 to around 100 today . According to owner Leslie Ferrin , who has three teapot shows scheduled this year , " eighty percent of my time with collectors is spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the teapot show has become a perennial client favorite . What is it about the teapot that we find so alluring ? " The essence varies from person to person . Some have an interest in the culture of tea , and the teapot is an icon for that . Or they fall in love with the vitality and jauntiness of the form , " says ceramics gallery owner Garth Clark , author of The Eccentric Teapot and a collector himself . " Visually , it 's very arresting and interesting . And it 's lively  --  it moves . It also allows for all kinds of games with anthropomorphism  --  legs , arms , sexual organs . Beautifully resolved , it can be the most expressive object a potter can make . " There 's a teapot to suit every taste and pocketbook  --  commercially produced novelties for a few dollars , handmade wares for hundreds , works by established ceramic artists for thousands , and historical treasures for up to six figures . Some collectors concentrate on the Western tea tradition , others on the East . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have their own following ) . Some collect the accoutrements of tea  --  bowls , cups , infusers . " People are attracted to teapots because you can collect all elephant ones , all figurative ones , all pottery ones , all women artists . And you do n't necessarily have to spend a lot of money . They 're relatively approachable and affordable , " says the Los Angeles businessman Sonny Kamm , an art collector and former dealer in contemporary glass who , with his wife , Gloria , has amassed over 800 teapots dating " from 1700 to yesterday . " For Kamm , who does n't even like tea much , teapot collecting is pure enjoyment , done with discernment , but " lightly . " He scours flea markets as well as galleries , appreciates cheap kitsch as much as Meissen : " We never buy anything just to " ooh ' and " ah " over . " Their eclectic approach encompasses everything from objects by the cream of artists working with the form to a Miss Piggy teapot Kamm keeps in his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Fiesta ware to fanciful pieces that are " beyond silly  --  lions , rabbits , dancing monkeys . " For those whose interest is contemporary craft , the teapot offers a way to collect broadly in the field , with extraordinary variety , and still have what Dorothy Weiss calls " a body of work that 's coherent . " Sanford and Diane Besser of Little Rock , Arkansas , have teapots by more than 200 American and British ceramists , the earliest from around 1970 by Robert Brady , the " most interesting " a vision of the Mad Hatter 's tea party by Michael Frimkess , featuring Freud and other offbeat guests . The couple had already been collecting ceramics for some years when they bought their first teapot , by Chris Staley , in 1984 . " I assumed most , if not all , ceramic artists had done one or more , " Sanford Besser recalls . " I became fascinated by the idea of how an individual takes the constants of handle , spout , lid and body and treats them . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that appealed to Donna and Bill Nussbaum of St. Louis , whose 200-plus collection ranges from the classic functional work of Jeff Oestreich to representational teapots like a 1950s-style diner by Jerry Berta and a family of woodpeckers by Annette Corcoran , to one of chicken wire by Leopold Foulem . " They can be fun , or serious , or both . The best are seriously fun , " says Bill Nussbaum . Leslie Ferrin thinks " collectors very much capture contemporary American craft in this form " because it defies easy categorization : " A teapot stands there making this point about itself . It could be this , it could be that . It 's East versus West , function versus nonfunction , art versus craft . " Peter Shire , the Los Angeles ceramist and sculptor , once called the teapot the " Holy Grail of pottery " ( lately he 's been making them in steel ) . " The teapot is the epitome of a potter 's problem , materially , physically and aesthetically , " says Tom Turner of Delaware , Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who describes himself as " kind of from the old school , " the goal is a teapot that is " one hundred percent functional , " meaning more than just drip-free . " To me , the greatest function is visual appreciation . " His best customers , he says , are those who have maybe had a ceramics class , who will pick up a pot , lift the lid , notice the tight fit . " I make very quiet pots . You really have to be looking . " The difference between the " potters " potters " and those whose intentions are more sculptural sets up " a healthy dialogue , " thinks Dan Anderson of Edwardsville , Illinois , one of many who fall somewhere in the middle ( his architectural teapots are exhibited in galleries but " do pour magnificently , " he notes proudly ) . " We potters always say it really is n't finished until it 's used . But when it sells for four figures , people do n't want to use it . " Anderson has been acquiring teapots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There are so many opportunities for it to become the individual that makes it , " he says . " Everybody in my collection I know , and most are my friends . I really see them in the teapots in a way that I would n't in , say , a cup . And after all , is n't that what we 're doing it for ? As an extension of heart , mind and spirit ? " " For potters , the teapot is the point-counterpoint of everything we make . It provides that ultimate challenge , to really make it work and have a voice , " says Michael Sherrill of Hendersonville , North Carolina , who has used it for " explorations of space , light and color " for 15 years . " My teapots are in no way functional . I 'm not interested in whether it pours or not , but does it work visually ? " An admirer of the Shaker aesthetic , he tries to bring the teapot form to its essence . " For me , it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does it need ? It 's a process of reduction . " He likes its ability to invoke life 's daily rhythms . " Everyone has archetypal associations with the teapot . It does n't push the viewer away , saying , " This is the holy of holies . " A lot of what we do in the art world does that . " Such seductiveness leaves plenty of room for mischief . The teapot has long been a vehicle for humor , satire and improbable content , a tradition carried on today by ceramists such as Adrian Saxe of Los Angeles , whose interpretations have included a demure 19th-century maiden with a huge phallic spout protruding from her petticoats . " The need to categorize and identify is very strong in our culture , " says Saxe , who , " rather than fight it , " tries to " play with people 's expectations . " His teapots are homages to the ideas of ritual , contemplation , protocol and cross-cultural exchange embodied by the form . They are also wickedly campy spoofs of preciousness and pretension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentler life , when for the most part , granny 's heirloom teapot sat on the shelf and people used tea bags . " Kurt Weiser of Tempe , Arizona , finds the formal , earthbound teapot effective as " a little stage set " for his exotic painted scenes of " total fantasy , " such as a monkey pouring tea into a river . Perhaps no artist loads this comfy object with more unsettling imagery than Richard Notkin of Oregon , whose small , socially conscious teapots in the realistic Yixing style , depicting such things as a nuclear blast or a human heart in chains , can be painful to look at . " I like the tension between the tradition of the teapot and its most unlikely interpretations . Notkin 's really nailing it , " says Joan Takayama-Ogawa , a Los Angeles ceramist . She , however , makes unabashedly playful teapots , as " a form of recreation . They 're fun . I use them as a break . It 's a great way to explore form and surface , to pursue subtle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " flippant one-liner , " she notes , " the elegance holds the humor in check . " And , like small netsuke , " it has the potential for monumentality in spirit and form . " The New York sculptor Raymon Elozua exaggerates the teapot 's scale ( and everything else about it ) in works like The Party 's Over , best described as the decaying , chaotic remains of a monstrous teapot the size of a washing machine , a lifeless cup dangling at its core , dripping red . Elozua merrily characterizes it as a black-humored take on " the death of teapots and the teacup and ceramics and the world as we know it . " Though he believes " function limits vision , " he likes the teapot form for the usual reasons . " One , it 's like juggling . You 've got all these elements to play with . Two , it 's the most iconic of ceramic symbols . And three , the sexuality . It 's passive-aggressive . " His focus is the interior . Taking the teapot as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he " draws " its figure by bending and welding a steel skeleton , then fleshes out the inside with shards of broken clay teapots , representing " remnants of the past , " of craftsmanship and what Elozua sees as its tendency to " fetishize perfection . " While the clay teapot is being pushed to the brink of deconstruction , what of that other archetype , the sterling silver teapot ? If the teapot is as much the metalsmith 's domain , why do relatively few make them ? Harriete Estel Berman , a California metalsmith interested in domestic iconography ( her sculptures refer to irons , toasters and the like ) , wondered about this after " watching the teapot phenomenon for a few years " and noticing that all the action seemed to be in clay ( she 's never made one herself , but has studied them extensively ) . She conducted her own informal survey of the field , and , at last year 's conference of the Society of North American Goldsmiths , presented her conclusion  --  that most activity and innovation in metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to the teapot , they tend to get very conservative . They get obsessed with function , letting it dictate design . I thought , " Come on , people in ceramics gave this up years ago , ' ' " says Berman , who believes " there 's a conceptual level that 's not been explored " in metal teapots , except by a few . " Generally speaking , clay has left metal way behind in terms of exploration of the teapot form , " agrees Tom Muir , a metalsmith from Perrysburg , Ohio , who attributes this to the considerable investment of time , labor , material and technical skill required to manipulate metal into a complex holloware form . Muir 's own sterling teapots , which are nonutilitarian ( " but I 'm interested in utility " ) , are formed and fabricated , with as many as 67 soldered joints . " Potters can throw a pot in 15 minutes , " observes Charles Crowley , a Boston-area metalsmith . Through spinning and other efficient holloware techniques , Crowley can approximate a " potter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chances for that fortuitous mix of " the accidental and the intentional . " Though his teapots are often sculptural , he finds function hard to ignore . " lt 's honest . Customers pay a lot of money . They should be able to use it and clean it . " He adds , " When people buy silver , they want the thing that lasts , like their grandmother 's . " Even the most adventuresome art collectors , the " really wild guys , " want an heirloom , says Crowley , " something they can engrave and pass on to their children . " For the maker , then , " a lot of the fun materials and colors do n't hold up . " Others known for their metal teapots are Susan Ewing , Randy Long , Chunghi Choo , Kee Ho Yuen , Nancy Slagle , Robly Glover , Robert Farrell and Boris Bally , to name a few . " Most of these metalsmiths think of the teapot as sculpture , " says Rosanne Raab , a New York City art consultant who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expressions " for Fortunoff . " They 're not concerned with making the equivalent of Gorham , International or Georg Jensen . It is a vocabulary that is understood , but they 're not competing on that level . " At present , the market for service pieces by studio metalsmiths is generally limited to a " small collector 's circle " and " some private commissions , " according to Raab. " lt 's economics , and the fact that people are living a more casual lifestyle . " Nevertheless , she notes , silver retains its special aura of " prestige , position and family . " " We have an attitude toward silver . Give anyone ten cents ' worth , and the first thing they do is wrap it in a cloth and put it in a drawer , " observes metalsmith Myra Mimlitsch Gray of East Kingston , New York . Yet a silver presentation piece exists expressly for conspicuous display , to project an image . " There 's an irony to it that I really enjoy , " says Gray , whose conceptual teapots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " bourgeois luxury . " In her Encased series , she replicates the " ideal model " of an elaborate colonial silver teapot , then conceals it in an austere copper shell so that only hints of a spout , lid and handle are exposed . The work has a " feminist angle , " an assertion of the tactile ( female ) over the visual ( male ) , with overtones of containment and service . Whether political statement , art object or cultural icon , the teapot is here to stay , say its champions . " There 's a long and consistent history of fascination with the teapot , " says Garth Clark . Even when " the commercial edge has gone off it , " he predicts , the serious collectors will " stick with their obsession . " In Leslie Ferrin 's view , " there are pieces out there being made for the marketplace that do n't stand up to the best "  --  which nevertheless satisfy a range of tastes and budgets  --  but " there 's not a glut of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teapot is evolving into an " extraordinary art form , " as ceramists " creations become not just increasingly " ceramically literate " but also " more beautiful , more cunning  --  and I mean that as a compliment  --  more complex and sophisticated . I 'd hate to think this is a golden era , because that tends to signal the end of something . Let 's say a silver period . There 's no problem with one metaphor . I do n't think potters are done with it yet . " " I see teapots getting more complex in terms of a grouping or environment , " muses Dan Anderson , venturing a look into the future . After 30 years , the form continues to inspire him . " I think I can do a lifetime 's worth of work . I really do . " <p>
