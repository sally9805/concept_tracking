The house was a forest remembering itself . The pine trees that held up the walls dreamed of stars dwelling in their needles . Jointed , branched , rooted , the trees still listened to the wind . The oak floors gleamed from the generations of human oils , but they still grew into their immense lineage of light and matter . The air between the ancient trees whispered with spirit bees and dark small birds . <p> Even the iron that pierced the flesh of trees had a voice . It was deep , metallic , and sank heavily in the human dreams . At night , the iron spoke most eloquently , recognizing the kinship of darkness in sky and earth . The nails sang of geodes in the heart and the gathering of elemental forces only vaguely understood . When the iron sang , humans slept , troubled , their hands remembering the first iron . The spear , the knife , the sharp edge of death . <p> Under the house , the ancient continent measured the journey of clay animals : giant beaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast bears that had clawed the horizon to shreds . There is the memory of ice animals walking into the sun , their bones crushed under the weight of frozen moons . And there is the tribe of obsidian , those sharp-headed old ones , who danced around fire , singing the hunt before iron . <p> Long ago , the beavers built their lodges here , when the marshes were thick with mud and sweet rushes . In the middle of winter , the oldest would tell about First Beavers , giant creatures that gnawed down trees the size of the night . <p> The marsh became meadow ; wild horses ran into the thunder of their song . They pulled grass with their strong teeth and fertilized the young pines . Their foals stood weak-kneed under the slivers of moon that spiked the trees ' hearts . The horses rode the back of life and their bones crumbled into the afterbirth . <p> A family of black bears lived in the hollow tree that fell from the sky . A female bear shaman growled healing ceremonies , cleansing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning . <p> Later , a medicine man walked into the forest of tall trees . He heard the spirit horses drumming their hooves in the earth . All the others of their tribe , those descendants of runaway thunder , would within a short time be rounded up , branded with hot iron , put to the rein , plow , or wagon . Now , he only felt their leaving , south to hills of thick grass , and not their destiny . Only the deep belly breathing of the night horses brought out the clover smell of stars and taught the medicine man where to put his sweat lodge . <p> He circled a spot that spoke to him with the smooth tones of water and the rootlike dreams of animals . He cleared the brush , pulling up the grass with his strong old hands . He carried rocks which had once been polished by glacier and flood and then buried under gravel and sand . These round , rock ones danced themselves up to the rain again . Their tribe has two hundred thousand million words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speckled , crystallized , pitted , brittle , they know they are still part of Grandmother Earth 's medicine bag . <p> He carried these rocks to the fire pit . He cut down saplings and bent them down to the earth again , building a hut dark as the womb . The branches rooted into the spiritual earth . He made a fire and the rocks told the story of their molten beginnings and the wood danced away into the feathered wind . The rocks blackened and cracked , hissed and cooled , as he tossed barkfuls of water on them . Steam rose , hot and thick . <p> The medicine man was old . It was his last sweat . His arms were well-muscled , but his skin draped over his bones . That afternoon , he sweated where horses once snorted at coming storms . <p> He heard the slap of beaver tails . He felt an icy wind and saw <p> wavering image of a face . It was an old woman wrapped in long-furred hides . She wore a necklace of a single mammoth tooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the dark , what he saw was inside of him but came from beyond . He felt the bears snuffing muzzles . He nursed at one fingerlike breast . <p> Hours later , he crawled out of the sweat lodge . The night was clear . He sensed some kind of structure all around him . The stars shone through a roof high as the trees . It was a house , he figured out , but whether it was a metaphor for the universe or something from the future , he did n't know . The house was filled with busy humans . The people breathed their moisture into the trees . They offered up their breaths and the branches leafed out into air . People had been born in the house , their umbilical cords stretched from the salty waters to the nodding trees with their embracing branches . Cradled in wood , they slept with wood at the top of their heads where the soul enters , to the bottom of their feet , which is also called sole , but meant for grounding . The forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick-planked door of their death . <p> But what astonished him most of all was that he knew they were his children . Their skins were pink , white , brown , golden . Their eyes were the color of rocks : jade , obsidian , slate , amber . Or else the color of trees : green , yellow , brown . Some even had eyes the color of sky , water , or thunder . And their hair was the color of iron , bear , fire . <p> He saw them playing , laughing , arguing . He watched them dreaming , the soft dust of meteors sifting down through the roof to cover their faces with cool fire , their calm hands luminous , reaching out . <p> He awoke with a start . He saw the last of his vision dissolve into the cold morning air . But it had been a twisted and spotted arm that had reached out from his dreams . It was an arm from reality . <p> His people were dying . That was why he was here , to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream a cure . <p> He got up , clearing his throat . It felt dry . He took a deep breath to cleanse his body . The air around him felt hot . He ran the edge of his hand across his forehead . <p> His people had always been healthy . Only one plant had been necessary per patient . Now , the sicknesses did n't respond to his medicine . He tried many plants , gathered them , dried them , pounded , seeped , and boiled them . Nothing worked . He needed a new medicine , one strong enough to stop death . <p> He pulled out his medicine bundle from his pack . He unrolled it , the leather supple . Packets of herbs were bound neatly . In <p> small bag , he fingered the splinter of wood touched by lightning . <p> He used it for lancing . His fingers were long ; the pads on the fingers were sensitive to the variables of health and sickness in the human body . In his mind 's eye , touching a healthy body was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear you could n't tell which was air and which was water . <p> He set aside a bundle of dried salmonberry bark . It was good for the stomach when you ate too much salmon . There were also bundles of dried leaves , stems , and roots of the stinging nettle . He used this for headaches , pain of childbirth , and the ache in the joints of old people . Finally , he found the two packets he 'd been looking for : dried strawberry leaves for a tea and twigs from willow to cool a fever . <p> He made himself tea . He would eat nothing . He would fast and sweat until he was given the new plant for healing . He sipped the tea slowly . He could feel power in this place , but he was beginning to be aware of a strange uneasiness . <p> He thought of his grandsons . They 'd been angry , on edge . His granddaughters had set their jaws firmly , eyes hard and brittle . Their dreams were of fire and strange spotted humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed ! Two moons ago ? No , it was when the Ute trader came from the south . <p> The medicine man had held the wobbling head of an infant as she died . He had smoothed the white hair of an old man who had terrible sores on his body . The man was a cousin . The two had raced together across the meadows when they were young , tiptoed silently beneath the nesting herons , stood watch at the edge of camp . Now , his old friend was dead , along with fourteen others . <p> He got up and prepared for another sweat . <p> Inside the lodge , the air was thick . He brewed the willow twigs in the water he 'd used to make the steam . He felt the long fronds of willow trees growing down into the darkness , their leaves glowing like bright spears or flashing fish . He felt the heat taking away his flesh , so that his bones became twigs . He was a willow tree bent over rocks and water . <p> He waited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his people . He threw more water on the rocks . The steam rolled off in crushing waves of liquid heat . He felt his chest tighten . He was the last hope . His knowledge of plants that helped the body was immense , but he needed a deeper vision . He waited , praying . <p> He did n't feel the ponies gathering in the dark , their hooves heavy and powerful . He did n't see the bears disappearing into their own shadows . He did n't see an old woman beckoning to him . <p> His hand clutched at his chest . He fell over , head striking the stones , the darkness taking him into itself . <p> Three nights later , a big storm came up from the west . It blew down the old tree over the silent , cold sweat lodge . The tree fell down on the bones of an old man , bones that became tiny spirit horses , and bones that bears used for dream medicines in their long winter sleep . And bones that flowered from plants gathered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
