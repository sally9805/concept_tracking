<p> Just off your Aunt Sadie 's favorite chair - better move Aunt Sadie first . She may be sitting on a fortune . <p> A team of antiques appraisers from some of the nation 's top auction houses has just begun a 13-city cross-country tour this summer to videotape the new " Chubb 's Antiques Roadshow " for public television . And if their recent stop in the colonial town of Concord , Mass. , is any indication , the sort of treasures they will find will be buried in the attic , next to the tool box , and under a pile of Life magazines . <p> " The fun part of the show is you never know what 's going to come , " says Christopher Hartop , a silver appraiser from Christie 's in New York . " It will be interesting to see how different this will all be from region to region . " <p> The Concord Armory , the site of the first taping , was filled with more curiosity-seekers than fortune-seekers . Lorraine Consoletti of Boston was happy when an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 , especially since she had won it in a drawing . <p> " He said it dates to the late 1800s , it came from China , and was made in the ' thousand flowers style , ' " she says afterward , cradling the elaborate plate in a nest of Bubble Wrap . " You can count the flowers , but who has the time ? Is n't it pretty ? " <p> The day was a kind of reverse yard sale , with a few hundred hopefuls lining up at cloth-draped card tables staffed by some of the keenest eyes in the business . <p> Some flocked to Pottery and Porcelain , some to Collectibles , and others to Toys , Dolls , and Games . But while many were called , few were chosen for videotaping . <p> " The producers ask the appraisers to be poker faced when they see something special , so they can capture the surprise on film , " says Barbara Knight , an organizer of the event , sponsored by the Chubb group of insurance companies . Mind you , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out their furniture is worth an absolute fortune , " she says , " while another who thinks it is valuable will find out it is not . " <p> If this sounds cruel , remember that the advice is free . One woman from Maine carted in a heavy wooden chair with carved wings attached to the armrests . When an appraiser told her , gently , that it was " a bit rustic " and not worth all that much , her eyes welled up with tears . But she was all smiles by noon . Other appraisers had looked at her pictures of other family heirlooms , and they were all worth much more than she expected . <p> In all fairness , the idea for this show comes from Britain , where a similar program has been a favorite on the BBC ( see accompanying story ) . Pam Faulkner , a recent immigrant from Ireland , says she used to enjoy watching the original show back on her native sod , and thought she would give the Yank version a shot . <p> " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland in the 1930s , " says Ms. Faulkner , resting her arm on the back of a formidable , medieval-looking chair . Still , she was surprised and " thrilled " when an appraiser told her she should insure it for $ 1,000 . " I could sell it for $ 750 , but I 'm not swapping anything . " <p> Long ago at a yard sale , a green vase with tarnished silver overlay caught the eye of Davi Adler 's mother . She bought it for $ 5 . Today , Ms. Adler has had the vase appraised . On camera . <p> " It 's a Lutz vase , made in Austria . The appraisal price is $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 . " <p> Adler beams . " My mother had a good eye . " <p> But the experts turned a cold eye to the turn-of-the-century paperweight in the palm of Bob McGowan . <p> " I was offered more money for this 20 years ago , " he says , holding what looks like a huge glass marble with blue , red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he is disappointed , the burly man shrugs . " It was my father-in-law 's . " <p> The ability to distinguish a work of art from a piece of junk comes from hands-on experience more than book learning , says William Lipton , the expert at the Oriental Arts table and owner of a gallery in New York . He demonstrates his appraisal skills by examining a Chinese silver case for sewing needles . <p> " These carvings look like lotus blossoms , " he tells one person in an encouraging tone , turning the small , tarnished cylinder over in his palm . " This part is a hook so you can put it on your belt , and on the hook there is the character that means ' long life . ' You could polish that up and probably get $ 100 or $ 200 for it . " <p> Over in the middle of the room , a flurry of activity suddenly surrounds a man , a woman , and an easel . A small crowd begins to form behind a row of television cameras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a framed piece of cross-stitched embroidery , is worth $ 20,000 . Nancy Druckman , the head of American folk art at Sotheby 's in New York , had calmly explained to the man that the piece of cross-stitching was no mere memento . <p> " It was the first piece I saw today , and I got a big rush , " she says later , off-camera . " Initially , I just told him , ' This is a really nice piece , ' and then I got the producers . He was thrilled . He had found it in a trunk , had done a lot of research on it , but he had no idea of its value . " <p> The news was more mixed for Ruth Paddock of Wayland , Mass . Her desk-like piece of furniture turned out to be the lower part of an 18th-century highboy . " They said it was worth about $ 1,500 as it is , but if I had the top piece with the drawers , it would be worth $ 50,000 . " <p> " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Deborah , says with a laugh . <p> Antiques-lovers may project a certain serenity , but in truth they are an intense , passionate people , known to brake the car suddenly at the sight of a Tiffany lamp in a country store . Consider Erica Meyer , for instance , who was the first in line at 7:15 a.m. at the Armory . For an hour and a half she waited , holding an old teapot and listening to the clink of aluminum bats from the Little League field across the street . <p> " They told me it was a Rockingham-type ware and probably worth $ 300 to $ 400 , " she gushes later to Chris Jussel , the host of " Chubb 's Antique Roadshow . " " That 's much more than I paid for it . " <p> " There 's an old saying among antique dealers , " Mr. Jussel responds with a grin . " I 'd rather have a good eye than good knowledge . " <p> By noon , the stream of visitors has slowed to a trickle , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American decorative arts at Christie 's , looks at two pooped journalists preparing to leave . " As soon as you let your guard down , something comes up , " he says , and then arches his eyebrow . " My guard is n't down yet .
