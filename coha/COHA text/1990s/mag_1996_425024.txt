Someone committed a simple error that , according to the plant 's blueprints , should have been impossible , and a valve was left open , a pipe ruptured , a technician was trapped in a crawl space , and a small fire destroyed several workstations . At first the alarm was disregarded : false alarms commonly flashed through the plant like birds in a tropical rain forest . Once the seriousness of the accident was appreciated , the rescue crew discovered that a soft-drink dispenser waiting to be sent out for repair blocked the room in which the radiation suits were kept . After moving it and entering the storage room , they learned that several of the oxygen tanks had been left uncharged . By the time they reached the lab the fire was nearly out , but smoke laced with elements from the actinide series filled the unit . Lying on his back above the ceiling , staring at the wormlike pattern of surface corrosion on the tin duct a few centimeters from his face , Timofey had inhaled the fumes for an hour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that he was inhaling dollar bills and that once they lodged in his lungs and bone marrow , they would bombard his body tissue with high-energy dimes , nickels , and quarters . Timofey had worked in 16 nearly his entire adult life , entrusted with the bounteous , transfiguring secrets of the atom . For most of that life , he had been exhilarated by the reactor 's song of nuclear fission , the hiss of particle capture and loss . Highly valued for his ingenuity , Timofey carried in his head not only a detailed knowledge of the plant 's design but also a precise recollection of its every repair and improvised alteration . He knew where the patches were and how well they had been executed . He knew which stated tolerances could be exceeded and by how much , which gauges ran hot , which ran slow , and which could be completely ignored . The plant managers and scientists were often forced to defer to his judgment . On these occasions an edge of derision showed in his voice , as he tapped a finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was only a single correct answer to the question . After Timofey 's death , his colleagues recalled a dressing-down he had received a few years earlier at the hands of a visiting scientist . No one remembered the details , except that she had proposed slightly altering the reaction process in order to produce a somewhat greater quantity of a certain isotope that she employed in her own research . Hovering in his stained and wrinkled white coat behind the half dozen plant officials whom she had been addressing , Timofey objected to the proposal . He said that greater quantities of the isotope would not be produced in the way she suggested and , in fact , could not be produced at all , according to well-established principles of nuclear physics . Blood rushed to the woman 's square , fleshy , bulldog face . " Idiot " she spat . " I 'm nuclear section secretary of the Academy of Sciences . I fucking own the established principles of nuclear physics . You 're a technician " Those who were there recalled that Timofey tried to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaw in her reasoning his voice lost its resonance and he began to mumble , straying away from the main point . She cut him off , asking her audience , " Are there any other questions , any educated questions ? " As it turned out , neither Timofey nor the scientist was ever proved right . The Defense Ministry rejected the proposal for reasons of economy . Timofey 's relations with his co-workers were more comfortable , if distant , and he usually joined the others in his unit at lunch in the plant 's low-ceilinged , windowless buffet . The room rustled with murmured complaint . Timofey could hardly be counted among the most embittered of the technical workers  --  a point sagely observed later . All joked with stale irony about the lapses in safety and the precipitous decline in their salaries caused by inflation ; these comments had become almost entirely humorless three months earlier when management followed a flurry of assuring memos , beseeching directives , and unambiguous promises with a failure to pay them at all . No one had been paid since . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his workplace in an old Zhiguli that he had purchased precisely so that he could arrive home a half hour earlier than if he had taken the tram . Against the odds set by personality and circumstance , he had married , late in his fourth decade , an electrical engineer assigned to another unit . Now , with the attentiveness he had once offered the reactor , Timofey often sat across the kitchen table from his wife with his head cocked , listening to their spindly , asthmatic eight-year-old son , Tolya , in the next room give ruinous commands to his toy soldiers . A serious respiratory ailment similar to the boy 's kept Marina Dmitrievna from working ; disability leave had brought a pretty bloom to her soft cheeks . The family lived on the eighth floor of a weather-stained concrete apartment tower with crumbling front steps and unlit hallways . In this rotted box lay a jewel of a two-bedroom apartment that smelled of fresh bread and meat dumplings and overlooked a birch forest . Laced with ski tracks in the winter and fragranced by grilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even gray wolves , the forest stretched well beyond their sight , all the way to the city 's double-fenced perimeter . His colleagues thought of Marina Dmitrievna and the boy as Timofey was pulled from the crawl space . He was conscious but dazed , his eyes unfocused , and his face slack . Surrounded by phantoms in radiation suits , Timofey saw the unit as if for the first time : the cracked walls , the electrical cords snaking underfoot , the scratched and fogged glass over the gauges , the mold-spattered valves and pipes , the disabled equipment piled by an unused workstation , and the frayed tubing that bypassed sections of missing pipe and was kept in place by electrical tape . He staggered from the lab , took a shower , vomited twice , disposed of his clothes , and was briefly examined by a medic , who took his pulse and temperature . No one looked him in the eye . Timofey was sent home . His colleagues were surprised when he returned the next day , shrugging off the accident and saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before going on the " rest leave " he had been granted as a matter of course . But his smile was as wan as the moon on a midsummer night and his hands trembled . In any case , his colleagues were too busy to chat . The cleanup was chaotically under way and the normal activities of the plant had been suspended . Early one evening a week after the " event , " as it was known in the plant and within the appropriate ministries ( it was not known anywhere else ) , Timofey was sitting at a cafe table in the bar of a towering Brezhnev-era hotel on one of the boulevards that radiated from the nucleus of Moscow . A domestically made double-breasted sport jacket the color of milk chocolate hung from his frame like wash left to dry . He was only fifty years old but , lank and stooped , his face lined by a spider-work of dilated veins , he looked at least fifteen years older . His skin was as gray as wet concrete , except for the radiation erythema inflaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair bristled from his skull . Set close beneath white caterpillar eyebrows , his blue eyes blazed . He was not by nature impressed by attempts to suggest luxury and comfort , and the gypsies and touts milling outside the lobby had in any case already mitigated the hotel 's grandeur . He recognized that the lounge area inside was meant to approximate the soaring glass and marble atria of the West , but the girders of the greenhouse roof impended two stories above his head , supported by walls of chipped concrete blocks . A line of shuttered windows ran the perimeter above the lounge , looking down upon it as if it were a factory floor . The single appealing amenity was the set of flourishing potted plants and ferns in the center of the room . Timofey strained to detect the aspirates and dental fricatives of a foreign language , but the other patrons were all either Russian or " black "  --  that is , Caucasian . Overweight , unshaven men in lurid track suits and cheap leather jackets huddled over the stained plastic tables , blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from their drinks and eyed the people around them . Then they fell back into negotiation . At another table , a rectangular woman in a low-cut , short black dress and black leggings scowled at a newspaper . Directly behind Timofey , sitting alone , a young man with dark , bony features decided that the hick would be incapable of getting a girl on his own . He wondered if Timofey had any money and whether he could make him part with it . Certainly the mark would have enough for one of the kids in ski parkas waving down cars on the boulevard . The young man , called Shiv by his Moscow acquaintances ( he had no friends ) , got up from his table , leaving his drink . " First time in Moscow , my friend ? " Timofey was not taken off guard . He slowly raised his head and studied the young man standing before him . Either the man 's nose had once been broken , or his nose had never been touched and the rest of his face had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath his eyes jutted askew . The youth wore a foreign blazer and a black shirt , and what looked like foreign shoes as well , a pair of black loafers . His dark , curly hair was cut long , lapping neatly against the top of his collar . Pieces of jewelry glinted from his fingers and wrists . It was impossible to imagine the existence of such a creature in 16 . Shiv did n't care for the fearlessness in Timofey 's eyes ; it suggested a profound ignorance of the world . But he pulled a chair underneath him , sat down heavily , and said in a. low voice , " It 's lonely here . Would you like to meet someone ? " The mark did n't reply or make any sign that he had even heard him . His jaw was clenched shut , his face blank . Shiv wondered whether he spoke Russian . He himself spoke no foreign languages and detested the capriciousness with which foreigners chose to speak their own . He added , " You 've come to the right place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Timofey continued to stare at Shiv in a way that he should have known , if he had any sense at all , was extremely dangerous . A craty , Shiv thought , a waste of time . But then the mark abruptly rasped , in educated , unaccented Russian , " I have something to sell . " Shiv grinned , showing large white canines . He congratulated him , " You 're a businessman . Well , you 've come to the right place for that too . I 'm also a businessman . What is it you want to sell ? " " I ca n't discuss it here . " " All right . " Shiv stood and Timofey tentatively followed him to a little alcove stuffed with video-poker machines . Incandescent images of kings , queens , and knaves flickered across the young man 's face . " No , this is n't private enough . " " Sure it is , " Shiv said . " More business is done here than on the Moscow Stock Exchange . " " No . " Shiv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitress , in a rare display of zeal , had already cleared . His drink was gone . Shiv frowned , but knew he could make her apologize and give him another drink on the house , which would taste much better . He had that kind of respect , he thought . " You 're making the biggest mistake of your life , " Timofey whispered behind him . " I 'll make you rich . " What changed Shiv 's mind was not the promise , which these days was laden in nearly every commercial advertisement , political manifesto , and murmur of love . Rather , he discerned two vigorously competing elements within the mark 's voice . One of them was desperation , in itself an augury of profit . Yet as desperate as he was , Timofey had spoken just barely within range of Shiv 's hearing . Shiv was impressed by the guy 's self-control . Perhaps he was serious after all . He turned back toward Timofey , who continued to appraise him . With a barely perceptible flick of his head , Shiv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for travel agencies and masseuses . Timofey remained in the alcove for a long moment , trying to decide whether to follow . Shiv looked away and punched the call button . After a minute or so the elevator arrived . Timofey stepped in just as the doors were closing . Shiv said , " If you 're jerking me around ... " The usually reliable fourth-floor dezhurnaya , the suppurating wart who watched the floor 's rooms , decided to be difficult . " More , " she said after Shiv slipped her a five-dollar bill . She returned the second fiver because it had a crease down the middle . Shiv had been trying to pass it off for weeks , and now conceded that he would be stuck with it until the day he died . The crone accepted the next bill scowling , and even then gazed a long time into her drawer of keys , as if undecided about giving him one . As they entered the room , Shiv pulled out a pack of Marlboros and a gold-plated lighter and leaned against a beige chipboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecticide ; unperturbed , a fly did lazy eights around the naked bulb on the ceiling . Shiv did n't offer the mark a cigarette . " All right , " he said , flame billowing from the lighter before he brought it to his face . " This better be worth my while . " Timofey reached into his jacket , almost too abruptly : he did n't notice Shiv tense and go for the dirk in his back pocket . The mark pulled out a green cardboard folder and proffered it . " Look at this . " Shiv put back the blade . He carried four knives of varying sizes , grades , and means of employment . " Why ? " " Just look at it . " Shiv opened the folder . Inside was Timofey 's internal passport , plus some other documents . Shiv was not accustomed to strangeys shoving their papers in his face ; indeed , he knew the family names of very few people in Moscow . This guy , then , had to be a nut case , and Shiv rued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark stared up through the stamped black-and-white photograph as if from under water . " Timofey Feydorovich , pleased to meet you . So what ? " " Look at where I live : Skotoprigonyevsk - 16 . " Shiv made no sign of being impressed , but for Timofey the words had the force of an incantation . The existence of the city , a scientific complex established by the military , had once been so secret that it was left undocumented on the Red Army 's own field maps . Even its name , which was meant to indicate that it lay 16 kilometers from the original Skotoprigonyevsk , was a deception : the two cities were nearly 200 kilometers apart . Without permission from the KGB , it had been impossible to enter or leave 16 . Until three years earlier , Timofey had never been outside , not once in twenty-three years . He now realized , as he would have realized if he had n't been so distracted by the events of the past week , that it was n't enough to find a criminal . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper in the past five years . " Now look at the other papers . See , this is my pass to the Strategic Production Facility . " " Comrade , " Shiv said sarcastically , " if you think I 'm buying some fancy documents  --  " " Listen to me . My unit 's principal task is the supply of the strategic weapons force . Our reactor produces Pu-239 as a fission by-product for manufacture into warheads . These operations have been curtailed , but the reactors must be kept functioning . Decommissioning them would be even more costly than maintaining them  --  and we ca n't even do that properly . " Timofey 's voice fell to an angry whisper . " There have been many lapses in the administration of safety procedure . " Timofey looked intently at Shiv , to see if he understood But Shiv was n't listening ; he did n't like to be lectured and especially did n't like to be told to read things , even identity papers . The world was full of men who knew more than Shiv did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black cloud rose from the stained orange carpeting at his feet and occulted his vision . The more Timofey talked , the more Shiv wanted to hurt him . But at the same time , starting from the moment he heard the name " Skotoprigonyevsk-16 , " Shiv gradually became aware that he was onto something big , bigger than anything he had ever done before . He was nudged by an incipient awareness that perhaps it was even too big for him . In flat , clipped sentences , Timofey said , " There was an accident . I was contaminated . I have a wife and child , and nothing to leave them . This is why I 'm here . " " Do n't tell me about your wife and child . You can fuck them both to hell . I 'm a businessman . " For a moment , Timofey was shocked by the violence in the young man 's voice . But then he reminded himself that in coming to Moscow for the first time in twenty-six years , he had crossed into a land where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the right guy for the deal after all . There was no room for sentimentality . He braced himself . " All right then . Here 's what you need to know . I have diverted a small quantity of fissile material . I 'm here to sell it . " Shiv removed a handkerchief from his jacket and savagely wiped his nose . He had a cold , Timofey observed . Acute radiation exposure severely compromised the immune system , commonly leading to fatal bacterial infection . He wondered if the hoodlum 's germs were the ones fated to kill him . Timofey said , " Well , are you interested ? " To counteract any impression of weakness given by the handkerchief , Shiv tugged a mouthful of smoke from his cigarette . " In what ? " " Are you listening to anything I 'm saying ? I have a little more than 300 grams of weapons-grade plutonium . It can be used to make an atomic bomb . I want $30,000 for it . " As a matter of principle , Shiv laughed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chill seeped through him as far down as his testicles . " It will fetch many times that on the market . Iraq , Iran , Libya , North Korea  --  all have nuclear weapons programs . But they do n't have the technology to produce enriched fissile material . They 're desperate for it . There 's no price Saddam Hussein would n't pay for an atomic bomb . " " I do n't know anything about selling this stuff ... " " Do n't be a fool , " Timofey rasped . " Neither do I. That 's why I 've come here . But you say you 're a businessman . You must have contacts , people with money , people who can get it out of the country . " Shiv grunted . He was just playing for time now , to assemble his thoughts and devise a strategy . The word " fool " remained lodged in his gut like a spoiled piece of meat . " Maybe I do , maybe I do n't . " " Make up your mind . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A predatory light flicked on in the hoodlum 's eyes . But Timofey had expected that . He slowly unbuttoned his jacket . It fell away to reveal an invention of several hours ' work that , he realized only when he assembled it in the kitchen the day after the accident , he had been planning for years . At that moment , his entire body had been flooded with a searing wonder at the dark soul that inhabited it . Now , under his arm , a steel canister no bigger than a coffee tin was attached to his left side by an impenetrably complex arrangement of belts , straps , hooks , and buckles . " Did you see how I rigged the container ? " he said . " There 's a right way of taking it off my body and many wrong ways . Take it off one of the wrong ways and the container opens and the material spills out . Are you aware of the radiological properties of plutonium and their effect on living organisms ? " Shiv almost laughed . He once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me see it . " " It 's plutonium . It has to be examined under controlled laboratory conditions . If even a microscopic amount of it lodges within your body , ionizing radiation will irreversibly damage body tissue and your cells ' nucleic material . A thousandth of a gram is fatal ... I 'll put it to you more simply . Anything it touches dies . " Shiv did indeed have business contacts , but he 'd been burned by them about six months earlier , helping to move some Uzbek heroin that must have been worth more than a half million dollars . He had actually held the bags in his hands and pinched the powder through the plastic , marveling at the physics that transmuted such a trivial quantity of something into so much money . But once he made the arrangements and the businessmen had the stuff in their hands , they gave him only $2,000 for his trouble , little more than a tip . Across a table covered by a freshly stained tablecloth , the Don  --  his name was Voronenko , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Don anyway , and being served spaghetti and meatballs for lunch  --  grinned at the shattering disappointment on Shiv 's face . Shiv had wanted to protest , but he was frightened . Afterward he was so angry that he gambled and whored the money away in a single night . He said , " So , there was an accident . How do I know the stuffs still good ? " " Do you know what a half-life is ? The half-life of plutonium 239 is 24,000 years . " " That 's what you 're telling me ... " " You can look it up . " " What am I , a fucking librarian ? Listen , I know this game . It 's mixed with something . " Timofey 's whole body was burning ; he could feel each of his vital organs being singed by alpha radiation . For a moment he wished he could lie on one of the narrow beds in the hotel room and nap . When he woke , perhaps he would be home . But he dared not imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never happened . He said , " Yes , of course . The sample contains significant amounts of uranium and other plutonium isotopes , plus trace quantities of americium and gallium . But the Pu-239 content is 94.7 percent . " " So you admit it 's not the first-quality stuff . We 've got to talk more reasonably about price . " " Anything greater than 93 percent is considered weapons-grade . Look , do you have somebody you can bring this to ? Otherwise , we 're wasting our time . " Shiv took out another cigarette from his jacket and tapped it against the back of his hand . Igniting the lighter , he kept his finger lingering on the gas feed . He passed the flame in front of his face so that it completely immolated the mark . " Yeah , I do , but he 's in Perkhuskovo . It 's a forty-minute drive . I 'll take you to him . " " I have a car . I 'll follow you . " Shiv shook his head . " That wo n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the gate alone . " " Forget it then . I 'll take the material someplace else . " Shiv 's shrug of indifference was nearly sincere . The guy was too weird , the stuff was too weird . His conscience told him he was better off pimping for schoolgirls . But he said , " If you like . But for a deal like this , you 'll need to go to one godfather or another . On your own you 're not going to find someone walking around with $30,000 in his pocket . This businessman knows me , his staff knows me . I 'll go with you in your car . You can drive . " Timofey said , " No , we each drive separately . " The mark was unmovable . Shiv offered him a conciliatory smile . " All right , " he said . " Maybe . I 'll call him from the lobby and try to set it up . I 'm not even sure he can see us tonight . " " It has to be tonight or there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a hurry . You said the stuff lasts 24,000 years , right ? " " Tell him I 'm from Skotoprigonyevsk-16 . Tell him it 's weapons-grade . That 's all he needs to know . Do you understand the very least bit of what I 'm saying ? " The autumn evening was still in its adolescent hours , alive to possibility . As the two cars lurched into the swirl of traffic on the Garden Ring road , Timofey could taste the unburned gasoline in the hoodlum 's exhaust . He had never before driven in so much traffic or seen so many foreign cars , or guessed that they would ever be driven so recklessly . Their rear lights flitted and spun like fireflies . At his every hesitation or deceleration the cars behind him flashed their headlights . Their drivers navigated their vehicles as if from the edges of their seats , peering over their dashboards , white-knuckled and grim , and as if they all carried 300 grams of weapons-grade plutonium strapped to their chests . Driving among Audis and Mercedes would have thrilled Tolya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his small collection of mismatched models . The thought of his son , a sweet and cheerful boy with orthodontic braces , and utterly , utterly innocent , stabbed at him . The road passed beneath what Timofey recognized as Mayakovsky Square from television broadcasts of holiday marches . He knew that the vengeful , lustrating revision of Moscow 's street names in the last few years had renamed the square Triumfalnaya , though there was nothing triumphant about it , except for its Philips billboard . And were all the advertisements on the Garden Ring now posted in the Latin alphabet ? Was Cyrillic no longer anything more than a folk custom ? It was as if he had traveled to the capital of a country in which he had never lived . Of course hardly any commercial advertising could be seen in 16 . Since Gorbachev 's fall a half-hearted attempt had been made to obscure most of the Soviet agitprop , but it was still a Soviet city untouched by foreign retailing and foreign advertising . The few foreign goods that found their way into the city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Asian , European , and North American factories by demoralized Russian workers . Well , these days 16 was much less of a city . It was not uncommon to see chickens and other small livestock grazing in the gravel between the high rises , where pensioners and unpaid workers had taken up subsistence farming . Resentment of Moscow burned in Timofey 's chest , alongside the Pu-239 . Plutonium . There was no exit for the stuff . It was as permanent and universal as original sin . Since its first synthesis in 1941 ( what did Seaborg do with that magical , primeval stone of his own creation ? put it in his vault ? was it still there ? ) more than a thousand metric tons of the element had been produced . It was still being manufactured , not only in Russia but in France and Britain as well , and it remained stockpiled in America . Nearly all of it was locked in steel containers , buried in mines or sealed in glass  --  safe , safe , safe . But the very minimal fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped in nuclear tests , reactor accidents , transport mishaps , thefts , and leakages  --  veiled the entire planet . Sometime within the next three months Timofey would die with plutonium in his body , joined in the same year by thousands of other victims in Russia and around the world . His body would be brought directly to the city crematorium , abstractly designed in jaggedly cut , pale yellow concrete so as to be vaguely " life-affirming , " where the chemistry of his skin and lungs , heart and head , would be transformed by fire and wind . In the rendering oven , the Pu-239 would oxidize and engage in wanton couplings with other substances , but it would always stay faithful to its radioactive , elemental properties . Some of it would remain in the ash plowed back to the earth ; the rest would be borne aloft into the vast white skies arching above the frozen plain . Dust to dust . Yet it remained intangible , completely invisible , hovering elusively before our eyes like a floater . People got cancer all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a DNA site is knocked out of place , a chromosome sequence is deleted , an oncogene is activated . It would show up only in statistics , where it remained divorced from the lives and deaths of individuals . It was just as well , he thought , that we could n't take in the enormity of the threat ; if we did , we would be paralyzed with fear  --  not for ourselves , but for our children . We could n't wrap our minds around it ; we could think about it only for a few moments and then have to turn away from it . But the accident had liberated Timofey . He could now contemplate plutonium without any difficulty at all . And it was not only plutonium . Timofey was now exquisitely aware of the ethereal solution that washed over him every day like a warm bath : the insidiously subatomic , the swarmingly microscopic , the multi-syllabically chemical . His body was soaked in pesticides , the liquefied remains of electrical batteries , leaded gasoline exhaust , dioxin , nitrates , toxic waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untreated sewage  --  the entire carcinogenic and otherwise malevolent slough of the great Soviet industrial empire . Like Homo Sovieticus himself , Timofey was ending his life as a melange of damaged chromosomes , metal-laden tissue , crumbling bone , fragmented membranes , and oxygen-deprived blood . Perhaps his nation 's casual regard for the biological consequences of environmental degradation was the result of some quasi-Hegelian conviction that man lived in history , not nature . No wonder everyone smoked . For a moment , as the hoodlum swung into the turning lane at the Novy Arbat , Timofey considered passing the turnoff and driving on through the night and the following day back to 16 's familiar embrace . But there was only $120 hidden in the bookcase in his apartment . It was the sum total of his family 's savings . Now Shiv saw Timofey 's shudder of indecision in his rearview mirror ; he had suspected that the mark might turn tail . If he had , Shiv would have broken from the turning lane with a shriek of tire ( he savored the image ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge over the Moscow River , the brilliantly lit White House on their right nearly effervescing in the haze off the water . It was as white and polished as a tooth , having been capped recently by a squadron of Turkish workers after Yeltsin 's troops had shelled and nearly gutted it . Shiv and Timofey passed the Pizza Hut and the arch commemorating the battle against Napoleon at Borodino . They were leaving the city . Now Timofey knew he was committed . The hoodlum would n't let him go . He knew this as surely as if he were sitting in the car beside him . If the world of the atom were controlled by random quantum events , then the macroscopic universe through which the two Zhigulis were piloted was purely deterministic . The canister was heavy and the straps that supported it were beginning to cut into Timofey 's back . He could have even more easily evaded Shiv at the exit off Kutuzovsky Prospekt ; then on the next road there was another turnoff ; then another and another . Timofey lost count of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole . He 'd never find his way back . Soon they were kicking up stones on a dark country road , the only traffic . Every once in a while the river or one of its tributaries leaned to the right and showed itself through the naked , snowless birches . A pocked slice of moon bobbed across his windshield . Shiv paused , looking for the way , and then abruptly pivoted his car into a lane hardly wider than his car . Timofey followed , taking care to stay on the path . He could hear himself breathing : the sound from his lungs was muffled and wet . Gravel crunched beneath his tires and bushes scraped their nails against the car 's doors . The hood slowed even further , climbing a small span made of thick planks . They clattered like bones . Timofey 's rearview mirror incandesced . Annoyed , he pushed it from his line of sight . Shiv slowed to a stop , blinked a pair of white lights in reverse , and backed up just short of Timofey 's front bumper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his rear . Shiv stepped from his car onto the bridge . Pinned against the night by the glare of headlights , the boy appeared vulnerable and very young , almost untouched by life . Timofey detected a measure of gentleness in his face , despite the lunar shadows cast across it . Shiv grimaced at the driver of the third automobile , signaling him to turn off his headlights . He walked in front of his own car and squeezed alongside the brush to Timofey 's passenger door . " We have to talk , " he said . " Open it . " Timofey hesitated for a moment , but the lengthy drive had softened his resolve and confused his plan . And there was a car pressed against his rear bumper . He reached over and unlocked the door . Shiv slid into the seat and stretched his legs . Even for short people , the Zhigulis were too goddamned small . " We 're here ? " " Where else could we be ? " Timofey turned his head and peered into the dark , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see at all . " All right , now hand over the stuff . " " Look , let 's do this right  --  " Timofey began , but then comprehension darkened his face . He did n't need to consider an escape : he understood the whole setup . Perhaps he had chosen the coward 's way out . " I see . You 're as foolish as a peasant . " Shiv opened his coat and removed from a holster in his sport jacket an oiled straight blade nearly 20 centimeters long . He turned it so that the moonlight ran its length . He looked into the mark 's face for fear . Instead , he found ridicule . " You 're threatening me with a knife ? I have enough plutonium in my lungs to power a small city for a year , and you 're threatening me with a knife ? " Shiv placed the shaft against Timofey 's side , hard enough to leave a mark even if it were removed . Timofey acted as if he did n't feel it . Again something dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a high carbon steel Premium Gessl manufactured by Imperial Gessl in Frankfurt , Germany . I paid eighty bucks for it . It passes through flesh like water . Just give me the goddamned stuff . " " No , I wo n't do that , " Timofey said primly . " I want $30,000 . It 's a fair price , I think , and I wo n't settle for anything less . I drove here in good faith . " Timofey was the first man Shiv had ever killed , though he had cut dozens of others , plus two women . He wondered if it got easier each time ; that 's what he had heard . In any case , this was easy enough . There was n't even much blood , though he was glad the mark had driven his own car after all . Now Shiv sat alone , aware of the hiss of his lungs and also that his armpits were wet . Well , it was n't every day you killed a man . But Timofey had n't resisted ; the knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as if he were a ghost . Shiv sensed that he had been cheated again . He opened and pushed away Timofey 's brown sport jacket , which even in the soundless dark nearly screamed Era of Stagnation . The canister was there , still strapped to his chest . The configuration of straps , hooks , and buckles that kept it in place taunted Shiv with its intricacy . He could n't follow where each strap went , or what was being buckled or snapped . To Shiv it was a labyrinth , a rat 's nest , a knot . To Timofey it had been a topographical equation , clockworks , a flowchart . " Fuck it , " Shiv said aloud . He removed his Swiss Army knife from his jacket and cut the thin strap above the cylinder with two quick strokes . Already the mark 's body was cool ; perhaps time was passing more quickly than Shiv realized . Or maybe it was passing much more slowly : in a single dilated instant he discerned the two cut pieces of the strap hovering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . But then they flew away with a robust snap and the entire assembly lost the tension that had kept it wrapped around Timofey 's body . The effect was so dramatic he fancied that Timofey had come alive and that he would have the opportunity to kill him again . The canister popped open  --  he now apprehended which two hooks and which three straps had kept it closed  --  and fell against the gearshift . Powder spilled out , but not much . Shiv grabbed the canister and shoveled back some of what was on the seat , at least a few thousand dollars ' worth . He could n't really see the stuff , but it was warm and gritty between his fingers . He scooped in as much as he could , screwed the cylinder shut , and then dusted off his hands against his trousers . He cut away the rest of the straps , leaving them draped on Timofey 's body . He climbed from the car . " Good work , lads . " The two brothers , Andrei and Yegor , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , which was parked flush against Timofey 's bumper . They were not twins , though it was often difficult to remember which was which , they were so empty of personality . Shiv , who had called them from the hotel lobby , thought of them as pure muscle . Although they were probably in their thirties , he knew they still lived with their mother , a wizened , sharp-tongued harridan whom they occasionally beat . By most standards of measurement , they were of equally deficient intelligence . They spoke slowly , reasoned even more slowly , and became steadily more unreliable the further they traveled from their last glass of vodka . Nevertheless , they were useful , and they could do what they were told , or a satisfactory approximation of it . " What do you got there ? " said Yegor . " You would n't understand , believe me . " It was then he saw that Andrei was holding a gun at his hip , leveling it directly at him . It was some kind of pistol that looked ridiculously small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun . In the old days , no one had a gun ; everyone fought it out with knives and brass knuckles and solid , honest fists , and pieces of lead pipe . You could n't get firearms . They never reached the market , and the mere possession of one made the cops dangerously angry . But this was democracy : now every moron had a gun . " Put it away . What did you think , I was going to cut you out ? " Yegor stepped toward him , his arm outstretched . " Hand it over . " Shiv nodded , as if in agreement , but he kept the canister clutched to his stomach . " All right , you 've got the drop on me . I admit it . I 'll put it in writing if you like . They 'll be talking about this for years . But you 're not going to be able to move it on your own . " " Why not ? " said Andrei . He raised the gun with both hands . The hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see straight down the barrel . " You think we 're stupid ? " " If you want to show me how smart you are , you 'll put down the fucking gun . " " I do n't have to show you anything . " " Listen , this is plutonium . Do you know what it is ? " " Yeah , I know . " " Do you know what it 's used for ? " " I do n't got to know . All I got to know is that people will buy it . " " Idiot Who are you going to sell it to ? " " Private enterprise . They 'll buy it from us just like they 'd buy it from you . And did you call me an idiot " " Listen , I 'm just trying to explain "  --  Shiv thought for a moment  --  " the material 's radiological properties . " Shiv was too close to be surprised . It happened too quickly . In one moment he was trying to reason with Andrei and intimidate him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , and had just observed , in a casual way , that the entire time of his life up to the moment he had stepped out of Timofey 's car seemed equal in length to the time since then , and in the next moment he was unconscious , bleeding from a large wound in his head . " Well , fuck you , " said Andrei . He had never shot a man before , and he was surprised and frightened by the blood , which had splattered all over Shiv 's clothes and even on himself . He had expected that the impact of the shot would have propelled Shiv off the bridge , but it had n't . Shiv lay there at his feet , bleeding against the rear tire . The sound of the little gun was tremendous ; it continued roaring through the woods long after Andrei had dropped the weapon to his side . Neither brother said anything for a while In fact , they were n't brothers , as everyone believed , but were stepbrothers , as well as in-laws , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From Yegor 's silence , Andrei guessed that he was angry with him for shooting Shiv . They had n't agreed to shoot him beforehand . But Yegor had allowed him to carry the gun , which meant Andrei had the right to make the decision . Yegor could n't second-guess him , Andrei resolved , his nostrils flaring . Now Yegor broke the silence with a gasped guffaw . In the bark of his surprise lay a tremor of anxiety . " Look at this mess , " he said . " You fucking near tore off his head . " Andrei could tell his brother was proud of him , at least a bit . He felt a surge of love . " Well , fuck , " said Yegor , shaking his head in wonder . " It 's really a mess . How are we going to clean it up ? It 's all over the car . Shit , it 's on my pants . " " Let 's just take the stuff and leave . " Yegor said , " Go through Shiv 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check the other guy . " " No , it 's too much blood . I 'll go through the other guy 's pockets . " " Look , it 's like I 've been telling you , that 's what 's wrong with this country . People do n't accept the consequences of their actions . You killed the guy , you go through his pockets . " Andrei scowled but quickly ran his hands through Shiv 's trousers , jacket , and coat anyway . The body stirred , and something like a groan bubbled from Shiv 's blood-filled mouth . Some of the blood trickled onto Andrei 's hand . It was disgustingly warm and viscid . He snatched his hand away and wiped it on Shiv 's jacket . Taking more care now , he reached into the inside jacket pocket and pulled out a gold-colored money clip with some rubles , about ten twenty-dollar bills , a few tens , and a creased five . He slipped the clip and four or five of the twenties into his pocket and , stacking the rest on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just some cash . " Yegor emerged from the car . " There 's nothing at all on this guy , only rubles . " Andrei doubted that . He should have pocketed all of Shiv 's money . " I wonder what the stuffs like , " said Yegor , taking the closed canister from Shiv 's lap . He placed it next to the money and pulled off the top , revealing inside a coarse , silvery-gray powder . Yegor grimaced . It was like nothing he had ever seen . He wet his finger , poked it into the container , and removed a fingerprint 's worth . The stuff tasted chalky . " What did he call it ? " he asked . " Plutonium . From Bolivia , I think he said . " Andrei reached in , took a pinch of the powder , and placed it on the back of his left hand . He then closed his right nostril with a finger and brought the stuff up to his face . He loved doing this . From the moment he had pulled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago or Miami . He sniffed up the powder . It burned , but not in the right way . It was as if someone  --  Yegor  --  had grabbed his nostril with a pair of hot pliers . The pain shot through his head like a nail and he saw stars . Then he saw atoms , their nuclei surrounded by hairy penumbrae of indeterminately placed electrons . The nuclei themselves pulsed with indeterminacy , their masses slightly less than the sum of their parts . Bombarded by neutrons , the nuclei were drastically deformed . Some burst . The repulsion of two highly charged nuclear fragments released Promethean , adamantine energy , as well as excess neutrons that bounced among the other nuclei , a cascade of excitation and transformation . " It 's crap . It 's complete crap . Crap , crap , crap " Enraged , Andrei hoisted the open container , brought it behind his head , and with a grunt and a cry hurled it far into the night sky . The canister sailed . For a moment , as it reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of moonlight along its sides . It looked like a little crescent moon itself , in an eternal orbit above the Earth , the stuff forever pluming behind it . And then it very swiftly vanished . Everything was quiet for a moment , and then there was a distant , voluptuous sound as the container plunged into the water . The two brothers turned toward each other , one of them with a gun , and everything was quiet again . Ken Kalfus is an American writer living in Moscow . <p>
