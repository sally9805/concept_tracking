From Love from Love <p> I dwell on the large picture book about the six senses : The Lady and the Unicorn on the Gothic tapestries . For many centuries they lay in a castle attic , rolled up and forgotten . In the nineteenth century George Sand called attention to their beauty , and Rilke wrote in The Notebook of Malte Laurids Brigge : " There are tapestries here , Abelone , tapestries . I make believe that it 's you who are here . There are six tapestries . Come , let us walk past them slowly . But first take one step back and look at them . Are they not filled with peace ? " <p> To See <p> In the middle of a blue island the lady sits holding a mirror in which the unicorn sees itself . She is dressed in a beautiful brocade dress with tight sleeves , a slip of blue moire , and a belt inlaid with jewels . Her hair hangs loose down her back , but toward the front there are two wisps twined with pearls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed tuft . With a faraway look on her face , she strokes the back of the unicorn 's head as it politely lays its front hooves on her knees . <p> On the other side , the lion holds the lady 's coat of arms , in a red sea of flowers and rabbits , falcons and whitethorn . <p> The winter aconites have grown as big as old-fashioned two-kroner pieces , and as they glistened in the sun where I was walking , I thought , Maybe I 'll pick a bouquet for Signe . Luck was with me because it made her very happy . It finally came out that I had n't done anything more than my " civic duty " because it turned out to be Signe and Axel 's copper wedding anniversary . They had been keeping it a secret . Because they did n't want extravagant presents , but they were glad to have aconites . <p> Signe is the kind of woman who , if she has a couple of eggs , will just bake up some apple fritters . <p> But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asks him to try it on , Birger snaps at her . It 's because he has just come home from work , and she comes running up with a sock . When someone snaps at her , it makes her sad , but she 's used to it , and they do n't mean anything bad by it . <p> Axel just does n't want to see her cleaning house . Housecleaning has to be done of course , but not seen . He does n't drive his bread truck into the living room , does he ? There 's a time and place for everything . So if he walks in unexpectedly , all of a sudden , she hides the dust cloth behind her back . When he comes home , he wants attention , not preoccupation . If there are crumbs on the oilcloth when it 's time for coffee , he wo n't complain . <p> Signe won a platter of meat at Bingo . She rattles off everything that was on it : one rib roast , one salami , one rolled sausage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meatballs , and one side of pork . <p> Today I sewed plum-colored wraparounds out of velvet  --  the remnants of the tablecloth  --  dyed a sweater peach , and listened to Ravel 's Daphnis and Chloe . A day 's work . <p> When I drink coffee at Signe 's at precisely 4:30 in the afternoon and Vivaldi or Mozart is suddenly playing on the radio , they shut the " noise " off immediately . They have an ear for music ; otherwise they would n't react so promptly . <p> There is always some embarrassment about not having turned it off quickly enough . <p> " Turn that off ! " Axel orders wearily . <p> " Yes , I was just going to do it , " says Signe and hurries over to the radio . " Right . " <p> The fact that it sounds like " noise , " I think , is a convention of theirs , and it would be " embarrassing " to step over the line and admit that they like Mozart . I ca n't completely explain why , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs from Danish Melodies might do in a pinch . But only for women . <p> The squirrels have had babies . <p> For the past two weeks , Signe has been washing and washing because they 're going abroad for the first time : a week in Majorca . " Surely you do n't have to wash anything else , " I said , feeling thoroughly exhausted on her behalf . <p> " No , not a big load , but I 'll probably have to take a look at some of Axel 's summer underwear . Even if maybe it is n't actually dirty , it can go a little stale from sitting in a drawer too long . " <p> I never realized that there was such a thing as " summer underwear " or that it could go " stale . " Actually , that 's just what people say about food  --  it 's " stale . " " That piece looks stale , " they say . But Axel never gets tired of food like that if it has a Danish meatball on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for twenty kroner a month . <p> Signe says , " All in all , it was what you call a good job , even if people did n't think you were much . Yes , back then there was something called common folk , and there was a difference between farmhands and owners , and a difference between the servants ' hall and where the owners lived . Maids chatting with the farmhands by the edge of the farm ditch during the summer  --  that just was n't done . All of the maids were afraid that it would end in a catastrophe . " <p> Axel says , " My mother ca n't understand why I hate a lady who 's old and arthritic now . But I worked for her , so I hate her . " <p> Eigild helps me in my garden and tells about the time his wife was laid up because he broke her leg with a broom handle when he was mad at her . Then he went outside and just left the pancakes cooking , and the men purposely delayed him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had gotten home in time for pancakes . He replied , " Yup , ' cause I runned inta ' em down by th ' edge a ' the woods . " There must have been a lot of yeast in those pancakes . <p> I love all the things people do n't feel like doing but manage to do year after year  --  sowing , planting , weeding , watering , fertilizing  --  for some miraculous reason . <p> Eigild wo n't give me permission to have hollyhocks , though . " They 're only for when you live in a half-timbered house with a thatched roof . " I ca n't have marigolds either . " Then you have marigolds all over the place , " Eigild says . The upshot of this was that I was allowed to have five sunflowers , way over by the other wing of the house . <p> Axel bought four calves from Gorm Erik while he was drunk . The baker bought twenty-eight . His wife is mad about all the cows . Signe was n't asked whether she wanted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surprise ! <p> Eigild puts in his two cents worth : " We 've always said it 's better for a man and his wife to milk a herd of cows ( eighteen ) by hand than it is to milk seventy-four cows by machine . " He also says that you should smear their teats with fat on sunny days " because there 's nothing as sensitive as one of those cracked teats . " <p> Today Shabanou was sitting on the kitchen floor eating a mouse so that the bones crunched , and I was stirring milk into powdered pudding . <p> Still , I do have cat troubles even though Shabanou is lying on my desk purring  --  because how long will it last ? Today I started to cry because she wants to have a monopoly over me and my house and not accept other cats , so I 'm starting not to like her and feel too tied down because I 'm afraid of losing her and so I want two cats , a spare , so I wo n't get desperate . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing her because she wants only to live alone with me . Everyone here is used to cats being something you do n't give a thought to . But still they compliment mine all the time , saying that she 's special . Eigild says , " I can tell you this , you 'll never get another cat like the Empress . " I know it , and that 's what I ca n't stand . That 's why I want a more normal and more run-of-the-mill cat , so that I do n't have so much to lose . I cry about being so afraid of constraints and illusions , about constantly preparing for death in life and for parting upon meeting . I have to be ready to die at any moment in order to be closest to life ; it 's nerve-racking and exhausting and unbecoming , so calm down , for heaven 's sake ! <p> The day passed with talk of electricity . No one here has water in these dry times . Except Eigild , who always keeps his high and dry . Signe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump has broken down for the nth time . Every morning for the past few days I 've walked down to the road in my bathrobe holding a kettle so I can brush my teeth . A full pail of water is out of the question ; I can get enough for a pot of tea , then that 's the end of that . ' ? guess you 'll have to drink whiskey , then , " Eigild says smartly , impressed with his wit . <p> It 's a gray foggy day and I 'm eating smores with Signe and mending a quilt cover . <p> Axel does n't want to see needlework in his house , perhaps because his mother sewed night and day to keep hunger from their door . It could be that Axel associates needlework with hardship . <p> George Sand associated her yarns with survival and salvation . My hands work quietly . <p> They say it 's arthritis that 's troubling Eigild . He 's been told to call the hospital to get UV light treatment , but he does n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I 've picked rushes from the bog for the white room . <p> Up at Tove 's place the cows are dying . That is , four are dead , and two " have one foot in the grave . " <p> I run over to Signe 's in shock and tell her about the power blackout in New York , with 360 prisoners in one cell , drug addicts going through withdrawal symptoms , diabetics without insulin , and epileptics crammed together on the same floor in 100deg heat . Signe gets impatient with my story and soon gets me to be quiet : " My dumplings have gone flat . " <p> I 'm afraid that Signe is going to have to go out of business . She whispers out of the corner of her mouth that her grocery store just ca n't make ends meet anymore . If she closed , it would be due to a lot of things . It would be due to the bureaucrats with their tape measures measuring the height of the ceiling and to the tax office with its demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit struggling to balance the books every night . And it would be due to the loss of customers who drive to the supermarket instead and come to Signe 's only to show solidarity by buying symbolic Chapstick , or of course they come on Sunday when they go around the back to buy beer . But if she closed , it would mainly be because she 's been hurt . Because she feels humiliated running her shop for no earthly use . Once she has turned the key in the lock and put in the sofa corner she 's always dreamed of where the shop is now , everyone will cry about it . As for me , I say that people will want small shops again some day , just like they want small schools . But Signe says that she ca n't wait around for the times to change and for people to become different . <p> I had invited Signe , Axel , Birger , and Ellen for caramel pudding ( Eigild wo n't eat at my house ; there have to be limits ) . Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse . <p> Whenever they come to my house for dinner , they always talk about class distinctions . They say that the workers bring it on themselves . Signe starts to cry because , under the cheerful influence of brandy ; Axel and I shouted that there is nothing more to life than love , politics , and religion . We added True Confessions for Signe 's sake . <p> So I could n't understand why she was crying because all of those things should have been more than enough . Well , I 'm sure I could easily spend my life just watching the seasons change , I thought just a bit too nonchalantly . But maybe our list was a cynical way of extinguishing hope , by saying that life " just is . " There really is n't anyone who can say what life " just is . " Among other things , life is making sure that dumplings do n't go flat . <p> Signe braided my hair the way she wore it when she was young . <p> Afterward , sitting knee to knee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songbook . But the men had left by then . They do n't have any desire to listen to our screeching . " Good Lord ! " We sang all twenty-nine verses of " Queen Dagmar Lies Sick in Ribe . " As soon as she 's dead , it ' s a sure bet that Valdemar will choose Bengerd , the tart , and never in his life little Kirsten , the gallant maid , as the queen advised him to . If a king has to choose between a gallant maid and a tart , the outcome is assured . Good Lord ! <p> Elvira says she really does n't give a hoot what people say about her , but if they do start saying things about her , just let them try ! <p> Late one night , after a party in the village hall , she was making out a bit too freely with a mere boy out by the flagpole . So I 've heard . Yes , a young kid . But the next day she called coast to coast to say that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key in the lock and boarded up the door to the grocery store . And she 's planted pansies where the steps were . She 's gotten a sofa corner inside , with cute teddy bears and wood paneling . Now all she dreams about is a bathroom and hot water . <p> Watching the cat walk down the stairs , zig zag zig zag , gives me such a feeling of delight that I do n't have any desire to die . <p> On the peninsula of Reers nearby , you can find tailless cats ; and at the inn , you can eat eel . The tailless cats are said to have come from the Isle of Man on a ship that was wrecked off the coast of Reerso . All the tailless cats abandoned the sinking vessel and swam straight to Reerso where they 're thriving . Why they lost their tails at some point , probably no one knows . But it 's certain that they can live only on Reersa , presumably because the climate is similar to that of the Isle of Man . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , they 've died . <p> They 're very rare . <p> Two pregnant women , feeling so fat because they had just eaten eel , were driving slowly down the road in a Citroen 2 CV . But they could n't get by a truck with a load of furniture driving in front of them , with a table on the top of the pile , its legs jutting rhythmically into the air . And in front of the load of furniture was a truck with animals that had died from natural causes , and on the top of the pile there was a dead cow , its four legs jutting rhythmically up into the air . That 's why the two pregnant omen could n't get by . They just had to sit there in Reerso and look at all of the dead legs up in the air . <p> They say that Hans , who moved in up on the hill , is going crazy . From loneliness , they say . I think he 's put an ad in the paper for a housekeeper . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shouts , " Can you stand it ? " <p> " Stand what ? " <p> " Well , everything . " <p> " Well sure , it 's OK . " <p> " Your cat 's been sick ! " <p> " Thanks , I know . " <p> He shouts that he 's been watching her through his binoculars ever since she was little . So I shouted that she was ten years old . <p> " She 's been in my bed . After all , you know what kind of cat you 've been lying in bed with . I 've watched it all through my binoculars , " he shouted back . <p> You should never live differently than you do while taking a walk : alive , yet just passing by , so that finally you could tip your hat while passing by : " I no longer wish to have the honor ... " <p> I had decided that Shabanou should keep one kitten , that in spite of her attitude there should be two cats in the house . Eigild killed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes . But this time a mistake was made . Eigild said himself , " I took all of the kittens but let her keep the one she was holding onto . " But after he had killed the others , it turned out that the one she was holding onto was n't really alive . Sure , it mewed and mewed but it could n't figure out how to find a nipple . It could n't even nurse . So after a while , it got completely quiet . Throughout the night whenever I periodically opened the flesh-colored wardrobe doors to check on the tabernacle , the Empress was lying at the bottom of it with a paw stretched majestically out over her dead kitten . And if I made a motion as if to take it away from her , she would disdainfully give it an extra lick . No petty consideration to life or death was to be taken here . No preferential treatment . For that reason , I really believed long into the night that it was alive but just sleeping . It was n't until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back in terror onto the moldy summer dress they were lying on . I had counted on feeling warm fur , but it was a cold rubber eraser . <p> The next morning I wandered around the farms to find her a kitten that was alive . But they were fresh out of kittens . <p> Now Axel ca n't deliver bread for the baker anymore . Because the baker is closing up shop . He does n't feel like it anymore , all that drivel . Because if he wants to bake rum cakes , he has to measure out the rum in ounces and pounds and income tax withholding rates and quarks so the bureaucrats can be certain that there has n't been any monkey business with the rum . Not that he drinks enough to mean anything , hah ! But if a person had to go on slaving and slogging with his accounts like that every single night , it could easily happen . Tip-a tap-a keg . <p> Things have gotten to be " overadministered . " Now he 's free from administering anything at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Axel has bought a thermos bottle and a lunch box now that he 's going to be driving to the factory since he ca n't deliver bread for the baker anymore . He 's gotten a job in fodder . He starts tomorrow . <p> He won a case of suds at Bingo . <p> The cat is sitting munching on a mouse ; it ' s the sound of the bones crunching that always amazes me . <p> There is a glass with deep purple lilacs on my flesh-colored nightstand . I 'm sitting dressed in a purple bathrobe . <p> What a day ! When you 've finally decided to bike to the station at Love and take the train from there , everything goes wrong . I had n't really figured out what the x 's and asterisks on the schedule meant . In the present instance they meant that there were almost no trains running . So I walked into a house across the street with a sign on it that said " Home . " And sure enough , a person with a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could use the phone to call a taxi . <p> Inside the house his young wife or his forty-year-old daughter was making pink wooden beds . An old granny sat rooted in the living room with one curlpaper on her forehead , as if she had been sitting there for years without moving . " Now you know where we live , " she said , nodding the entire time , as she ate roast pork loin with parsley sauce and potatoes . The man with the black mouth was doing the same thing . Yes , no question about it , now I knew where they lived . <p> Nothing came of the taxi , so I spent the rest of the day stuck at the station in powerlessness or indolence . It was a genuine red-brick station with wooden windows painted white and a charming pale-green waiting room , even though spring is too cold to wait in . There were two doors painted green that are closed for eternity , former rest rooms . There was a retired well on the station master 's platform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an upholstery workshop . But there was n't any furniture in it as far as I could make out through the dirty windowpane ; otherwise I would have found an old couch to warm myself on . The only thing I could catch a glimpse of was a cracked armchair , because of the little reflecting pool in its seat . <p> Finally , one day , a train did come . And the tickets were so funny that I was moved to tears . Huge whitish-yellow tickets that had to be punched by hand in eight different places , one punch for the hour , one for the date , one for the kind of ticket , from punch to punch , one punch for the price and one punch for the sun 's position to the second , one punch for the ticket taker 's attractiveness , encounter of the first kind . Oh , how I love to be ticketed . <p> The idea was for us to get town water . But there had to be an agreement about it , and those who actually needed clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for animals  --  clung to their old ways the most , their own , and did n't want to indulge themselves in anything . Their animals would actually have to fall down dead before they would admit that their wells were dirty . Eigild , for example , could never bring himself to be dependent on other people 's water . As if he had n't been kicked around enough , as if he had n't put up with crap his whole life . No , even if it meant that the world would come to an end , Eigild would sit on his own well . <p> But the fewer the people who wanted to be in on it , the more it would cost , of course . <p> There was going to be a meeting in the village hall . <p> The engineering firm wrote a whole lot of stuff up on the blackboard ; the price of the water pipes multiplied by the local area 's size , divided by bird feathers . Then one man got up and said , " Why are we just saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wife out shopping , we sure do n't ask her to just buy the first and most expensive thing , so why are we doing that now , I 'd like to know . " <p> Engineer Tobias and Sons ' calculations on the board were so cleverly arranged that all the small numbers came first and the big numbers came at the very end , so that you would be mentally warmed up to take the shock . I was sitting next to Axel and the clogmaker , who was sitting next to Rasmus Mailman . I went over and tugged at the bricklayer 's ear and told him that he 'd better come quick . In return I promised to comply with his conditions  --  that it would be a sunny day . <p> When the water meeting was over , I was just going to have some mineral water , but the clogmaker put a bottle of whiskey on the kitchen table and said I should have a drop . When the whiskey bottle had been emptied , the clogmaker placed a bottle of gin on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but each time it just about works and they haul him off to the hospital , he changes his mind . At any rate , he takes a slight rest at the hospital , not for too long , and in the twinkling of an eye , he 's fresh as a fish again  --  at a couple of hundred pounds . <p> He does n't put much stock in women ; maybe this is why we 're on the same wavelength . I do n't know which gender he takes me for . " She pushed me around and she ridiculed me , " he says about the wife who left him . Now he makes fun of the ladies , but mostly he makes fun of men because they have faith in women . Because the clogmaker has nothing to lose , aside from his next beer  --  and he looks forward to it too , every time . The time he was driving " in ice cream , " he came and made me a present of thirty-five lemon mousse desserts . When he talks , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62  --  no , now wait a minute ... " And then it turns out that it was in ' 61 or ' 63 because the daughter of Marie the carpenter 's wife was confirmed the year that Benny the smith got a new tractor . He always says , " It was late in the afternoon ... No , now wait a minute ... " And then it turns out to have happened early in the evening because the grocer had just been there , and , you know , he does n't get here until about . . . <p> I must have put the clogmaker to bed around four in the morning . No , now wait a minute . . . because of course he 's shaped so much like a ball that he fell out of bed several times , but then he just got up again to drink some more . And dance . He danced for such a long time that the mouse  --  which had been sitting under the refrigerator and which we had chatted with over the course of the evening but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attention  --  disappeared . And the clogmaker opened a bottle of chocolate liqueur . <p> Since Axel has been in fodder , he 's gotten a rash that wo n't go away . Maybe it 's because they drag around so much mercury , which is n't supposed to be taken near the animals . That 's what it says on the sacks . <p> I sit on my brass bed with papers and duties . The lilacs and jasmine send their fragrance in through my window . Axel came by with five tomato plants which I planted with my red fingernails down by the south wall . <p> Tomorrow I 'm going to lay out my great-grandmother 's embroidered flower tablecloth on the wobbly garden table which nearly collapsed beneath my blue brush strokes . Then I 'll set out some pate on it with port wine and toast , that is , if the sun is shining . <p> Since Axel has been in fodder , he talks to me as if I personified life 's injustices . When he was delivering bread and could set his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have coffee and when he was a walking newspaper , all was peaches and cream . But once he got that rash in fodder , I became a " fine lady . " and it does n't take much before I 've said something that 's taken amiss . Besides , he 's the one working and slaving , and he figures that writing a book is almost just a hobby . Signe writes too , confirmation songs . As she stuffs a cabbage head , she stands there humming and finds the words to match the melody of " The Old Tree . " <p> " What page did you get to on that book ? Should n't you see about taking care of your taxes soon ? " Axel asks . But of course I ca n't , since I do n't have any money . When I get a new bill , I cry . To be surrounded by pure shallowness . After all , I work twelve hours a day , and almost for free . I 'm not a burden on society , so just leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd rather be held accountable for everything else in my life except for taxes . But that option is n't available under the law . <p> Most of all I enjoy sitting on a chair wearing my rubber boots and thinking about infinity . I do n't care about climbing a ladder . <p> There are tapestries , Abelone , tapestries . Come , let us walk past them slowly . <p> Although her work is not widely known in the United States . Suzanne Brogger 's ( b. 1944 ) first book ( Deliver Us from Love , Delacorte , 1976 ) received high praise from Henry Miller : " Not since the days of Rabelais have I read anything , by man or woman , as daring and courageous as this book by a Danish woman .

Clearly Brogger 's work is a synthesis of genre , of fiction and journalistic technique that tells , shows , expands , reduces , comments by direction and indirection alike , seeking to convey a subjective illumination of life in the world . Brogger 's writing is spicy , intelligent , and witty , and while not directly a feminist ( " Women do not have to get on top . Our goals have never been that low " ) , she seeks in her work to redefine both personal and social life ( " The new center of society lies on the periphery of the old phallocracy " ) . The excerpt here is from her 1979 novel En gris som har vaeret oppe at slas kan man ikke stege ( Love from Love ) , a book set in the Danish country town of Love where she has lived for more than twenty years .
