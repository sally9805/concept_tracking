Forget day care ( for the moment ) . Forget children 's ski school . Forget kids-ski-free and parents ' ' - night- out and special kids ' ski weeks . What makes a true family resort worthy of the name is peace of mind . By that I mean a resort that makes each member of the family comfortable on snow and off  --  especially little kids , who require the most attention on a ski trip . A resort where young children feel free to go skiing , or rent a video , or return to the condo by themselves in the middle of the day . A place where parents know that since their kids ca n't get into trouble ( not much trouble , anyway ) , they can feel free to enjoy themselves , alone or with the kids , before , during , and after skiing . And where there 's enough happening to entertain teenagers , but not enough to overwhelm younger siblings . That 's my prescription for a family ski trip . Such Edens exist . I know  --  my family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vermont , is one . And Northstar-At-Tahoe , California , is another . What makes them special is that each is a self-contained , self-supporting escape module . This is not immediately apparent at Northstar . Its condo village looks like an ant farm on the resort 's map , and it stretches from slopeside up to a mile away . But the village is much more attractive than the map suggests , and easier to navigate thanks to a fleet of free shuttles that run all day and into the night . I was surprised at first to see so many small children riding the buses without parents , but it happens all the time . The shuttle drivers ask the kids where they 're going , then make sure they get off at the appropriate stops . Northstar is so self-contained , nobody can get lost . Northstar 's skiing is less predictable but equally accessible and easy to learn . It took me all of two runs to feel as if I knew the place ; children achieve that level of comfort in half that time . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's shaped a bit like a Chinese soup spoon , with a bowl that flows into a shallow funnel that leads back to the base . Relatively short but steep runs slice down from the rim ; pitches and benches and sidehills create quirks of character . A gondola runs from the base area up to the bowl , where a mid-mountain lodge serves as the main daytime base . A set of back-side trails are generally longer and steeper , and front or back , you can ski almost anywhere between the trees when snow conditions are right . Conditions were not quite right last March , but it hardly mattered . The base depth was 16 feet , and temperatures were in the 50 's . Sweater weather . The skiing ranged from lazy turns in soft corn on the front side to high-speed groomed cruising and long bump runs out back , and it took an SPF30 sunblock to prevent a burn . Fun for the whole family , all in all . Perfectionists will agree that Northstar lacks any truly precipitous steeps , and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge must leave the cocoon and try Sugar Bowl , Alpine Meadows , or Squaw Valley , all less than 30 minutes away . Northstar 's other slight deficiency is insufficient views of Lake Tahoe . The East Ridge trail offers a few glimpses ; the new Summit Deck &; Grille provides a more generous eyeful . Though limited , these views make Northstar a better place . The lake was a brilliant , intense blue during my visit , at once both awesome and peaceful . The resort 's family-friendly programs are appreciable , too . The Club Vertical program is especially appealing : For $59 , skiers get a free ticket , access to special ( short ) Club lift lines , and a discount on every ticket bought  --  $5 for adults , $10 for juniors 13-17 ; kids 5-12 pay $39 for enrollment and get $5 off the child 's ticket . Juniors start saving money after just three days of skiing , adults after five . And in the end , you ca n't forget about day care and other family matters . So Northstar has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including a learn-to-ski program with its own terrain . Parents are invited to come get the kids and go skiing or play whenever they want during the day . The resort recreation center has separate game and exercise rooms , and two hot tubs ( one for adults only ) . Horseback and sleigh rides provide alternative entertainment . Restaurants offer kids ' menus and reasonable prices . The resort has taken care of every last detail , leaving you free to relax and enjoy . There 's no greater luxury than that . <p>
