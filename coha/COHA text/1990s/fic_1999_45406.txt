The way it had been going , Cassidy knew they were going to have a hard time making it to Oaxaca from San Cristobal in one day . After Tuxtla the wooded Chiapas highlands fell behind them and the road lay across a dull , hardpan plain . The violet cordillera of the divide hovered straight ahead and off to their right an unbridgeable distance . Another grand Mexican vastness . Hardly forage enough for goats . Even the creosote bushes were stunted and sparse . <p> Cassidy studied the map , then shifted his gaze toward the dashboard . <p> " After Cintalapa , does n't look like much of any town before Juchitan , " he said , " quite a ways past that range . " <p> Levy glanced through the wheel at the gauges . <p> " I think we have enough , Lou . " <p> " Maybe it would n't hurt to fill up in Cintalapa , anyway , if the Pemex has unleaded . " " Lou , they have the stations spaced just about a tank-full apart . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze out the window toward the distant line of mountains . In the foreground a human speck watched them pass , barely distinguishable , wearing a high-crowned western hat and plaid shirt . Around him a handful of skinny goats manifested in the spare chaparral . The goatherd gave no outward indication that the nearness of Cintalapa affected his life in any way . <p> Five miles later , Highway I9 o bisected the ejido of Ernesto Cardenas de Cintalapa . Levy slowed through the ejido for the speed bumps . Planted tamarinds and palms bordered the highway , making stingy shade for a half-dozen old men and their burros who watched the traffic . <p> The ejido was strung out along a couple of miles of highway . They rode past clusters of adobes fenced with yucca and prickly pear , with the odd satellite dish aimed heavenward . At the centro the north side of the roadway sported a gleaming white sprawl of government housing . " Looks like cheap condos in the States , " Cassidy said . The opposite side of the road had a few small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the middle of everything a Pemex station advertised " Magna Sin ! " - its unleaded brand-on a flashy sign . <p> Levy slowed for a speed bump , his eyes straight ahead , showing no sign that he noticed the station . Cassidy lifted the water bottle from between the Blazer 's bucket seats , sipped and glanced toward the cooler stocked with refrescos and agua mineral that stood beside the station 's door . Their own bottle was half full . He took a long swig , and extended it to Levy . Levy took it and sipped , then handed it back to Cassidy . " I wonder what the people here do , " he said , eyes fixed on the road . <p> " Some of them work for Pemex , " Cassidy said . <p> They had driven nine thousand miles since leaving northern New York and had n't once run out of gas , despite close calls . Levy prided himself on his understanding of the Mexican psyche as expressed in space . Earlier he had made sure to fill up every morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the government monopoly . Three months ago , when they last crossed the isthmus , they did so along its northern coast , after filling up in Catemaco . Here , they faced a drier untenanted blankness , and dark rumbles from the guidebook : <p> " Only about 210 km. separate the Atlantic and the Pacific at the hot , heavily jungled isthmus of Tehuantepec , where the land does not rise more than 250 metres ... Winds are very strong on and near the isthmus , because of the intermingling of the Pacific and the Caribbean weather systems . Drivers of high-sided vehicles must take great care . " <p> Cassidy looked at the map again , then at the landscape thrumming under the sun . Mile by mile they gave in to its emptiness , the fuel gauge at half and the continental divide standing between them and the possibility of gasoline . He had an impression of being sucked into an exquisite vacuum . Not a bad feeling , really . <p> But he worried about anomalies in their luck . They had been turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from Guatemala , and forced to circle back around Quetzaltenango to Tapachula , losing a day . And Levy , showing the strain of some professional disappointments and a shrinking wallet , was losing track of his eating and sleeping habits , repeating himself a lot , dozing at the wheel . Yesterday he had renewed his detailed analysis of Cassidy 's personality defects , a project he had agreed to forgo earlier in the trip . <p> Cassidy 's wallet had also thinned . There would be no long lunch at the roadside cafe . He was capable of making the crossing waterless , provided they did n't run out of gas , and proud of it . But he was concerned now about Levy 's blood sugar level . <p> A boy stood by the roadside , just outside the ejido , holding out a net bag of mangoes . <p> " Let 's stop , " Cassidy said . <p> " Estos maduros , los mangos ? " he asked the boy . <p> " Si , de cinco minutos . " He waved toward a grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Veinte pesos , " about a quarter , by the current exchange rate . <p> Levy drove on . Cassidy opened his Swiss army knife and peeled the small sweet fruit . <p> " Use a towel , " Levy said . The first slices dripped onto the road map . Cassidy reached in the back seat for a towel , seeded the fruit and handed half toward Levy . <p> " I 'm fine , Lou . " <p> " Come on , Milo , breakfast was seven hours ago . " He shoved the fruit forward again . <p> " Really , Lou . I 'm not hungry . I know my body . " <p> Cassidy ate the mango . <p> " It 's great . " He peeled and ate a second fruit , the juice wetting his beard , and wiped his beard and the knife blade with the towel . <p> " Maybe I 'll have one in a little while . " <p> Cassidy read the guidebook out loud , careful not to drip mango juice on the page . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... Zapotec Indians ... Hammocks best quality .... " Then this : " Warning : The direct road from Tuxtla over the continental divide has been reported unsafe owing to violent robberies . Avoid night buses especially . Check conditions locally . " <p> " We did n't check conditions , " Cassidy said . <p> " It 's broad daylight . " <p> " You 're right . " <p> " Why are you anxious ? Where 's that old Cassidian sangfroid ? " <p> Cassidy said something and took another mango out of the bag . " I could n't hear you , " Levy said . <p> " Nothing . Want me to drive ? " <p> He drew the Swiss army pen blade over the green mango , exposing a crescent of mango flesh bright and orange as a fresh egg yolk . <p> " I 'm really fine , Lou . " After a moment of silence , Levy added , " I think maybe you need a meeting . " <p> " Probably right . " <p> " When was the last one ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee guy were the only ones there for the first half hour . It was in a ruin of one of the conquistadors ' houses . When everybody showed up it was Latinos in the front of the room , Indians in the back . Evangelistas . They asked me to share , but my Spanish was n't good enough . They all had that cheery buzz though , just like in the States . They brought the coffee around to you in perfectly clean glass cups . No Styrofoam . " <p> " You told me that . I just mentioned it because of your anxiety- " <p> " Well , maybe I 'll find a meeting in Oaxaca . " If we ever get there , he thought . <p> Levy stared into the middle distance . He looked gray , confused and messy , a little nutty . Cassidy worried about making it home to Lake Aurora . He handed a slice of mango across the seat again . <p> " Come on , eat something . " <p> Levy grabbed the slice and stuck it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handed him another slice . <p> " Just let me know if you want me to drive , " he said . <p> The road climbed gradually into the Sierra Atravesada under the high sun . Soon it twisted around canyon walls , where only they and the road betrayed a human presence . Rock , sun , chaparral , and the road crumbling in the narrow places , making them shift into four-wheel and slow to a crawl . The gas gauge showed a quarter tank . <p> " I like it when there 's nothing , " Cassidy said , looking out . <p> Levy remained silent . <p> " Want a sip ? " Cassidy extended the water bottle to Levy . <p> " We 're going to make it , you know , " Levy said . <p> Levy 's hands gripped the wheel as he slowed over some rubble that blocked the road . Beyond the outside shoulder the road fell into empty space . <p> " Come on , Milo . Either drink or have another mango . It 's hot . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when there 's nothing . Want a sip ? ' It 's malicious . As if all I ever think about is jeopardizing your big trip . " <p> " I just did n't want you to get dehydrated . " <p> " Well , it 's not going to be a problem . We 're going to make it . " <p> They rounded the curve in a canyon wall and started down the south slope of the sierra . In the distance a lemony glow hovered through the haze . <p> " What 's that ? " said Levy . <p> " The Pacific . " <p> Another desert plain extended beyond the sierra . They passed a sign reading " Juchitan , 90 km , " the bottle empty and the gauge at an eighth . Cassidy peeled mangoes . <p> To himself , Cassidy argued a contingency plan . He got stuck on which of them should remain with the car and which should walk for gas . Levy , he decided , was too addled to go . If nobody picked them up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusk and walk for Juchitan with half the mangos and his headlamp . The people were friendly and helpful and he would deliver himself to their kindness . He prayed that Levy would stay put and whoever came along would bear him equal generosity . <p> " There should be a station pretty soon , " Levy said . A tang from the invisible Pacific leavened the air . The vegetation turned gradually greener . Aloe and maguey started appearing , wild and cultivated . Even the sierra 's flanks softened under the high sun . <p> " It goes quite a ways on empty , " Levy said . <p> The needle touched the empty mark on the gauge . Recently Cassidy had been equipped with valves for siphoning off frustrations and resentments . He could n't control Levy , he had learned in the meetings . Resentment was his enemy . And he was no match for Levy in contests of will , anyway . God 's will ( an abstract concept of the meetings ) he 'd found in good repute among the people where they 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked . <p> Here , of course , he clothed his concept " God " in native dress . <p> " Maybe we should have stopped in Cintalapa , " Levy said . <p> Cassidy said nothing . A run of luck like Levy was having could addle anybody . First , funding had been halved for the popular nature documentaries he filmed for public television . Then he had decided to join Cassidy and investigate the possibility of a general-release documentary on Maya land claims . But he 'd been prohibited from shooting film in the Mexican ruins or using anything that required a tripod . In Guatemala the army made it clear his inquiries were unwelcome , and his awkward request to meet rebel leaders had been rebuffed . On the Pan-Am highway they 'd been ambushed by lost child-guerrillas , who demanded maps , lectured them and met Levy 's request to shoot film with raised assault rifles . <p> A half hour past the divide a Pemex station hove in sight . <p> " I was right ! " ( Levy . ) <p> A decrepit deuce-and-a-half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awning , and another waited its turn . Cassidy rolled down the window . <p> " Hay Magna Sin ? " he called to the attendant . <p> The attendant shook his head . <p> " No unleaded , " Cassidy told Levy . <p> " What should we do ? " <p> " I do n't know . Cuantas faltas a Juchitan ? " he called again . " Cincuenta . " <p> " About thirty miles . " <p> " Can we use leaded gas ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> " Will it hurt the car ? " <p> " Not much . Maybe blow out the catalytic converter . " <p> Levy pulled the Blazer behind the trucks waiting in line at the single pump . A few feet away , between a pair of wind-ravaged palms , an old man and woman sat under a plastic tarp , surrounded by hammocks hanging in bright coils from the tarp 's ridgeline . The tarp flapped and the coils swayed in the stiff breeze . <p> " It 's below empty , " Levy pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who needs the uncertainty , right ? " <p> " Right . " <p> Cassidy 's eyes met the old man 's , and the man stood up . The man unhooked one of the hammock and stepped out of the shade and into the unsubtle light . He walked toward the Blazer garlanded with bright coils and wearing a tightly rolled , straw western hat pulled low over his eyes , polyester shortsleeved shirt and slacks , and nylon sneakers . <p> " Hola , " Cassidy mumbled , knowing what was coming . <p> " Ay , senors , buenas tardes . Quisiera comprar una hamaca , ustedes ? " <p> " No tengo dinero , " Cassidy said . <p> " Ay , que lastima . " The man regarded the Blazer and the license tags briefly and expertly . " Su Blazer es muy macho , no ? " he said . He wanted to know if they 'd driven it all the way from Nueva York , here , to Mexico . <p> Cassidy told him yes , to Mexico and Guatemala , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it was very cold and snowy , not in New York City . <p> The exchange continued while the first truck pulled away from the pump . The man walked alongside while Levy followed the next truck in line . <p> " Mira , " the man said . " Mis hamacas son muy bonitas . " <p> " No tengo dinero , " Cassidy repeated . " Pero son muy bonitas , verdad . " <p> " Momento . " The man handed Cassidy the loop end of the hammock , then stepped away a few feet letting it unscroll between them , like a torero 's cape . He held the strands apart so they could appreciate the expertise of the weave , the intricacy of the design and play of colors . <p> " It 's really beautiful , " said Cassidy . <p> " It 's huge , " Levy said . <p> " It 's a family model . " <p> " You could fit a whole village in there . " <p> " Cuanto ? " Cassidy asked . He had already bought two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Cincuenta mil pesos . " <p> Cassidy frowned . The man immediately dropped the price ten thousand . <p> " Forty thousand . That 's about thirty dollars , " said Levy , displaying his grasp of the exchange rate . " Buy it . " <p> " I ca n't . I only have a few pesos , plus a hundred and fifty dollars to change in Oaxaca . " Sensing he had an aficionado on his hands , the man pointed out the excellence of the nylon materials and the workmanship , then dropped the price to thirty-five thousand pesos . " Para usted , " he said . Cassidy asked him who made the hammock . <p> " Mi familia . " The man waved toward the sierra behind him . " En las montanas , " he said . <p> The wind picked up , billowing the hammock and stretching it taut between them . <p> " Lo siento mucho , senor . No tengo dinero , " Cassidy said , with a note of finality . <p> " Ah , senior , por favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man looked to heaven and crossed himself histrionically . <p> " Come on , Lou . That 's only twenty bucks . " Levy said . " I 'll loan it to you . You can get it for Angela , and pay me in Oaxaca . You wo n't regret it . " <p> " I thought you were broke . " <p> " I am , but I have more than you do . Pesos , at least . " Cassidy turned to the man and told him twenty-five hundred . <p> " Madre de Dios ! " The man kissed his fingers and crossed himself again , eyes heavenward . " Bueno . OK . " <p> The second truck pulled away while Levy reached for his wallet and the man handed Cassidy the hammock through the window . Levy was impatient to pull up to the pump , so he handed a couple of bills across in front of Cassidy . <p> " Change ? " Levy said . " Cambio ? " <p> The man took the bills . <p> " No tengo cambio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand notes . <p> " Un momento . " <p> The man walked away and disappeared into the station . <p> " Jesus Christ , Milo . You do n't just hand some guy in the middle of nowhere a bunch of bills and trust him to come back with change . " <p> " He 'll be back . " <p> They bought water and just enough of the leaded gas to reach Juchitan . Before it was pumped the man came out of the station with a handful of bills . He carefully counted exactly the right change into Cassidy 's hand , and Cassidy handed it across to Levy . <p> " Muchas gracias , senores . Buen viaje a Nueva York del norte . " He stood waving behind them as they pulled out of the station and onto the straight flat highway . <p> " I told you he 'd come back . " <p> " It was still a bad idea . " <p> " Look , you got a beautiful hammock , and we made it to a station , so everything 's OR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " <p> " Tell me how to handle money , especially not in front of anybody . I 've traveled a lot more than you have and I know how to handle my money and when to trust the indigenous people . " <p> " You mean like the forty-dollar breakfast ? " <p> The station faded into the distance behind them . A dead horse rotted by the roadside . A blast of hot wind from the south drove the Blazer hard to the right and Levy tromped on the accelerator as if to compensate . <p> " That 's bullshit , Lou . " <p> The Blazer jumped over eighty . <p> " Careful , Milo . " <p> " Shut up . " <p> The Blazer hit eighty-five . Levy 's expression contorted with rage . <p> " You 're an asshole , Lou Cassidy ! " Levy yelled . He waved his fist in Cassidy 's face , one hand on the wheel . <p> " Jesus , Milo- " <p> " You never stop bringing that up , as if it means anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a lot of real fuck-ups , man . I knew they were there before we took this trip , but I never knew how bad they were . I 've been carrying you ever since we left , subsidizing you and putting up with your insults and you have n't thanked me once . I just bought you a beautiful hammock and you showed me nothing but contempt , you asshole ! " <p> The incident of the forty-dollar breakfast happened on their second morning in Mexico . They 'd gotten an early start from San Luis Potosi and pulled in at a truck stop out in the desert for breakfast , a place near a crossroad where a dozen familias stood outside food stalls hailing truckers and motorists . They sat at a sturdy table with high-backed chairs , ate mutton soup and fresh tortillas off colorful crockery and drank cinnamon-laced coffee , the best Cassidy had ever tasted . Three generations of women hovered around them . Levy made the grand gesture of picking up the ludicrously small tab . He pulled out two bills and handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " No tengo cambio . " Levy told her to keep it . <p> In the car Levy reflected as he put the key in the ignition , then consulted his wallet . " You know , Lou , " he said . " I might have just given her forty dollars instead of four . " They computed the exchange rate and confirmed the mistake . " I 'll just ask her for it back and I 'll pay her with these small notes and a couple of dollars , " Levy said , climbing out of the car . " They always want dollars . " " Good luck , " Cassidy had said . <p> The woman met Levy 's pleas with a stern face and shook her head no . Cassidy watched from the car while Levy waved greenbacks in her face , but she would n't yield . Levy returned to the car , crestfallen . <p> " Anybody can screw up the money , " Cassidy said , trying to help . " Maybe it 's just Mexico reminding us who 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Do n't give me that A.A. crap , " Levy had said . <p> Now , with the Blazer speeding headlong through the desert , Cassidy reflected he might have laid off on Levy after that . <p> " You just do n't have any impulse control ! " Levy screamed . " All I ever hear are your stupid shitty little put-downs . If you 're so great how come your work has n't come to anything , huh ? " <p> The Blazer topped out at ninety . Levy 's face had hardened into a mask , his body rigid and wooden . Cassidy feared for their safety . <p> " I do n't make any excuses for my work , " Cassidy said , intent on damping the emotional flames . " And I apologize if I hurt you carelessly . I picked up the wise-ass habit working with raft guides and ski bums . It 's bad , but it really does n't mean anything . But since you brought up work , Milo , I have to say that you never miss a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I guess . . . I can be . . . patronizing . " <p> " I wonder if you 're feeling insecure because my work has gone so well down here and you 've gotten the big bureaucratic run-around over the equipment and everything . You 've talked so much about changing your focus from nature , about turning fifty , about your mother dying last year . Anybody facing so many changes and set-backs in so short a time period has to expect- " <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> " Milo , I 've been really worried about you since we crossed the isthmus last time . You changed as soon we got past Catemaco . It 's almost like you came here to prove something to yourself , to recapture something , but it has n't gone well . Everything 's a challenge , the money , the food . . . the damn gas stations , for Christ 's sake . You 're projecting it all on me , generalizing my foibles-and I know I can be an asshole-into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ashamed of , anybody can have a rough time . But I 'm worried something could happen . So what I want to suggest is this : if you thought it would help , why do n't you let me call Nancy . We can put you on a flight out of Oaxaca or Mexico City , get you home and get you some help so you can get on with your work and not be so distracted by every little thing . The new drugs are really amazing . I 'll drive the Blazer back alone . " <p> The Blazer slowed to a crawl and pulled off the pavement onto a patch of desert a few yards away from a small sugar cane plantation . Levy looked coldly at Cassidy and said : " Get out . " <p> " Wait a minute , Milo . This wo n't solve anything . " <p> " Get out . " <p> " I 'm not getting out of the car in the middle of nowhere . We need each other . Why do n't you try to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Why do n't you just project yourself and your disgusting self-important diagnosis out of my car . Right now . I 'm sick of you . " <p> Cassidy was outmatched . If he were patient , spoke carefully , he figured the incident would play itself out . <p> " Let me get my stuff , " he said , reaching over the back seat for his Panama hat , backpack and briefcase . <p> " That 's it . Now get out . " Levy handed him a water bottle and gave him a push toward the door . <p> " I 've got books , maps . . " <p> " Do n't worry about that stuff . " The door slammed shut . <p> " What about my hammock ? " <p> " I bought the hammock . " <p> He sat on his backpack on the apron , giving Levy time to make his point before the green Blazer appeared again on the western horizon . <p> He found shade near a couple of scrub palms and tied a bandanna around the crown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . After an hour he reasoned that Levy had filled up in Juchitan before heading back , allowing Cassidy time to panic . That was fine . They were already too late to reach Oaxaca , unless they drove up through the desert after nightfall . He was sure they 'd find a good cheap place in Juchitan or Tehuantepec . Levy might already have checked one out . <p> He waved off one bus heading west , which slowed like it meant to pick him up , so he would n't miss Levy . After that nothing passed for a long time . The water level in the bottle dropped . Around five he felt hungry and the tropical sun began its rapid plunge into the Pacific . He shouldered his pack and took a few steps toward Juchitan , then stopped . <p> He was , he admitted , afraid to be on the road at night . Or not afraid , exactly . He just thought it not wise . If it was twenty-five miles to Juchitan , and nobody picked him up , he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risky . The Pemex station , on the other hand , was probably no more than four or five miles back . He could be there a little after dark if he hoofed it . It might be open . It had water , shade , and protection from the wind . Levy would be certain not to turn around before he got there . <p> He started walking . In the waning light the land around him looked suddenly green , the cane plantation lush and bountiful , the serrated cordillera rich with promise and hitherto unseen dimensions and convolutions . Flycatchers and hummingbirds flitted in the roadside chaparral and grackles chattered . He reminded himself of worse situations in his past , stuck on a road with no hundred and fifty dollars and nobody at home to send him any . In San Cristobal he 'd taken the precaution to e-mail his files home , so he would feel no great need to bargain with bandits for the laptop in his briefcase should he be attacked . <p> He actually felt relieved . <p> Half an hour later he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen zopilotes it now hosted . The less besotted of them hopped a few feet away and held their wings aloft to dry , the breeze fluttering their pin-feathers . The rest kept their heads buried in the horse 's abdomen . <p> After another hundred yards the sound of an engine approached from the west . A dot appeared on the horizon . He felt relieved again , but for a different reason , and hoped Levy had remembered to bring water . He stood and waited , composing his thoughts and features for the reunion . It had been a long trip , rewarding for both of them despite trials . They were tired . Without question he forgave Levy , in fact felt a grudging admiration for his rashness . Yet he had real concern for his friend 's health . He hoped his point had gotten across and that Levy would trust his good intentions . <p> Shortly the approaching vehicle resolved into an orange Dodge Power Wagon of mid-sixties vintage . As it drew closer he saw it was in mint condition despite the black exhaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the truck slow to a crawl . <p> The driver 's face materialized gradually , his intentions , if any , well masked . " Buenas tardes , senor , " the driver said . " Que pasa ? " The man smiled , putting Cassidy on the defensive . He answered only that he was heading for the Pemex station down the road . The man made a face wryly suspicious and asked why he would be going there without a car , when it would be closing soon . " Eres un bandito , used ? Un asesino ? No , eh ? " <p> Cassidy returned the mocking smile . " Do I look like one ? " he said . <p> " Get in , senior gringo bandito , " the driver said . " I 'll take you . " <p> His name was Hank .

Cassidy told him he lived in northern New York , the Adirondacks , near Canada . <p> " Hey , Lake Placid ! The Olympics ! " Hank said . " Milo Levy , the nature director ! You know him ? " <p> Unfazed , Cassidy admitted that he did , yeah , a little . <p> " I 'm his fan . I have his videos . " <p> " I 'll tell him when I get home . " <p> Hank showed him the big magnum he kept under the seat , gave him a warm Fresca in a can and offered to share a sip from a bottle of mescal , which Cassidy refused . Ten minutes later they pulled into the Pemex . <p> The attendant sat in a ratty nylon lawn chair outside the door , drinking a Coke . Bronze light flooded the cratered site and the flaking building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sierra 's corrugations deepened in the distance . The long shadows of the scrubby palms whipped in the wind . <p> " Hola , Hank , " the attendant said . He went inside and returned with two Cokes . <p> Hank stopped at the pump and filled up with low-octane rotgut . He waved to the man who 'd sold Cassidy the hammock and his wife , who were erecting an old-fashioned ramada of sticks where their tarp had been pitched . " Buenas tardes , abuelo y abuelita . <p> Como estan ? " Hank called . <p> The man and woman stood amid a rubble of sticks , flapping plastic and frayed polypropylene rope . The wind swung their coiled hammocks outward from the ridgeline of the tarp , which was strung between two low palms . They shrugged and the man told them the wind had blown down their tarp and they had begun building stronger shade for tomorrow . Weaving sticks was hard in these conditions , he said , concluding , " El istmo es muy ventoso . " <p> The attendant handed Hank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hank called back . He introduced Cassidy to the attendant , whose name was Moises , and told him Cassidy was a friend of the famous nature filmmaker Milo Levy . ( No response . ) Hank picked up Cassidy along the road on his way here . Why here ? Moises wanted to know . Waiting for a friend , Cassidy told him . <p> Moises eyed him coldly , then asked when his friend would be arriving . Soon , Cassidy said . <p> " Bueno , " Moises said . " Hay banditos en las montanas . " Moises took their bottles and finished sweeping out the bare office . He pulled down cages over the windows . Just before he locked and barred the door , Cassidy bought a liter of water from him with the last of his pesos . He tried to pay for the Coke he 'd drunk but Moises waved him off . <p> " Vamos ! " Hank called from the idling Power Wagon . <p> Moises and Cassidy walked to the truck . Moises got in while Cassidy stood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the glove box . <p> " Muchas gracias , Hank , " said Cassidy . " No problem , amigo . Here . " <p> He passed a faded snapshot through the window . <p> " Give this to Milo Levy when you see him . Tell him you met his fan Hank Escobar , who took this picture himself . Give it to him for me . " The picture contained a low angle view of a shrub and the yellow flowers of a prickly pear , but taken from such a distance that nothing was quite discernible . Behind it rose a hill of rock and sand . <p> " What is it ? " <p> " A hummingbird . " <p> Hank waved and gunned the Power Wagon out of the lot toward Juchitan . Cassidy sat on his pack and leaned against one of a cluster of low palms beside the road . He took out the copy of Stephens 's Travels he carried with him and opened it where he 'd left off . The sun disappeared . The wind diminished and the scents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book and looked across the arid but greening plain . The sky glowed peach . He could husband the water better now that the sun was gone . He began to feel the pinch and lassitude of early hunger . <p> " Perdoneme , senor . Que pasa ? " <p> Cassidy had forgotten the hammock dealer and his wife . He turned to face the old man , who stood behind him looking worried . <p> " Hola , abuelo , " Cassidy said , feeling the vague shame of the carless on the road . <p> " Donde esta su amigo ? " The man gestured toward Juchitan . <p> " Derrecho , " he said , imitating the gesture . " Mi amigo es loco . " <p> " Y su hamaca ? " <p> Cassidy waved toward Juchitan again . <p> " Ay , que lastima . " The man asked Cassidy when his friend would return for him , and Cassidy shrugged . <p> " Senor , por favor , venga con mio .

The man told his wife what had happened and she called Cassidy pobrecito and produced a couple of tacos of half-cooked beans and guacamole from a bundle and gave him stale pan dulce . The man handed him a metal cup of liquid and said , " Tomeselo ! " He raised it , smelled the delicious fumes of bathtub mescal and was instantly drunk . <p> " Hoo ! No gracias , senor . " <p> He handed the cup back to the man , who regarded him with shock . <p> " Porque no ? Esta muy bueno . " <p> He said he was sorry . He just did n't drink alcohol . <p> The man drew out a long , " Ahh , si , " as if that explained everything . Then he told Cassidy they were heading back to their home ir the sierra , but they would return in the morning . Cassidy was welcome to sleep in the hammock under the ramada if his friend failed to return . In the morning a bus would pass if he wanted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with food if he were hungry . <p> He thanked them , blushing with shame and embarrassment and gratitude . " No tengo dinero , senor . Lo siento mucho . " <p> " Yo se . Esta bien . " <p> They started up a dirt track behind the station under their loads . As they left , the man pointed to a corked bottle of mescal he 'd left beside the ramada . " Esta muy bueno , " he said in a loud stage whisper , and pointed to his temple . <p> The wind had finally abated . Cassidy sat on the hammock looking out over the plain . It was almost dark . He removed a sweater from his pack , made it into a pillow and lay back in the hammock as the first stars appeared in the west . He got up and hung his pack to protect it from scorpions . He lay down again and swung profoundly alert in the interstice between day and night . Goatsuckers darted like overgrown swallows through the twilight and owls moaned in the far darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed west . He fought fatigue so as not to miss a moment of this novel episode of his life . <p> He would , he knew , be all right , and he hoped Milo would as well , though Milo might be suffering . He could stay stranded here in the middle of nothing like the little guy he saw standing amid his goats outside Cintalapa , and be perfectly content . A peasant revolt might spring up and he would be there to report it . <p> He drank his water and counted the stars . It dawned on him that Levy was gone . The bus driver would likely take his dollars for himself but let him ride anyway . He would get off in Tehuantepec and call Angela to wire money to Oaxaca . She and Levy were friends . She would never believe his story . He got up to pee , stumbling off a few feet into the dark aridity . <p> I like it when there 's nothing , he thought , staring into the void . But there was never nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilizations ' scattered remnants echoed . He zipped up and looked heavenward like the old man deciding to sell him a hammock for less than half the asking price . The Milky Way formed a mass like frog spawn . He walked out to the road and looked up and down . <p> Of one thing he was certain : wherever Levy was at that moment , he knew he was right . <p> He returned to the hammock . He drank from the water bottle and the bottle was almost empty . The mescal beckoned from its corked Coke bottle like a genie . He could drink it all or one sip and nobody would ever know . The genie , he decided , was best left stoppered . <p> Sleep came and went through the night . He jerked awake at dawn , wanting to miss nothing . A spigot in the side of the station produced a trickle of water , which he used to wash his face and slick back his hair . He knew it would kill him if he drank it . Tired but energized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He carried his pack to the road , where the bus would see him , rested his head on it and dozed . He jerked awake again when a coatimundi came rummaging around the station for rinds and looked him over thoroughly before crossing the road into the bush . Indians staggered past under big loads and greeted him . He started liking the light-headedness his hunger conferred , and the pinch in the gut , but he worried the dehydration would give him a headache . <p> He heard the bus approach from a long distance , a third-class model . It would be fine as far as Tehuantepec . He stood and composed himself , made some fives and ones easy to reach in his wallet . If the driver would n't take them . . . what ? He could n't think . Something would work out . <p> The bus slowed , farting black clouds . A Bluebird school bus painted red , its name , Quetzalcoatl , was painted in colorful swirls above the windshield . It was less than full . It stopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few seconds and said , " Disculpame , senior . Sigues , por favor , " and gestured down the road . <p> The bus blared and exploded out of sight in black billows . He sat on his pack again just as the old man and woman walked out of the chaparral with coffee in a thermos , oranges , hard-boiled eggs and pan dulce . He had never tasted anything so delicious . He tried to give the old woman his two fives but she took umbrage and turned her face away . He dug in his pack and came up with a pair of small scissors and duct tape , which brought a quite different response . She brightened , accepted them eagerly and showed them to her husband . The old man beamed . <p> He helped the old man hang his hammocks in scallops , like bunting , so they luffed and snapped in the rising wind . Then they drank coffee and watched the traffic until an old Chevy Impala pulled up and discharged Moises , who opened the station . He seemed perturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man told him , <p> " Esta bien . " <p> They ate again , sitting out of the wind behind the ramada . Oranges , tortillas , beans with chiles , coffee . It made Cassidy tired . He realized he 'd been stranded for nearly twenty-four hours . He lay in the hammock as the old man pressed mescal on him again . He turned it down , asking his friend when the next bus would come . Any minute , the old man answered , but you must come home with us to the mountain and meet our family . <p> The foot of the mountain was a mile 's walk through the chaparral , a pleasant stroll . The slopes rose abruptly from the plain and he could see a cut in their green undulations where a trail probably passed and banana fronds waving in the wind . The little community would be not unlike home in its insularity , its contorted human relations , its infuriating contrasts of want and sufficiency . Like home the land would radiate in inscrutable topographies he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muchas gracias , " Cassidy said , shaking his head . <p> " Esta bien . " <p> Fifteen minutes later he stood by the road with an agua mineral in his hand as the second bus of the day slowed to pick him up , another third-class model named Maria Bonita . The driver accepted his five-dollar bill as fare to Tehuantepec . He stood in the aisle of the crowded bus with his pack at his feet , surrounded by Indians and desperadoes , finally certain there was no longer any need to watch for Milo . <p> In the Tehuantepec bus station he bought a ticket for Oaxaca , then stood on line outside a long-distance office to call Angela . His chest welled at the sound of her voice on the answering machine . He dictated his story onto the tape , hurrying before it cut him off . It sounded pathetic and ridiculous in English . He carefully read out loud the name , address , and fax number of the Oaxaca hotel he meant to stay in , told her loved her , and hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it would . This time he paid for a first-class bus though it meant waiting another hour . He needed the extra leg room so he could rest . He bought mangoes and oranges for the trip and two litres of agua mineral . He also bought a day-old Los Angeles Times at a newsstand and learned that the concerns of the day in his native land had to do with a rapidly spreading computer virus and lawsuits brought against breast-implant manufacturers . <p> He woke in a window seat at late afternoon . High desert extended in every direction , a dry wildness frightening in its unmappable variety . The light seemed to have no source , but to come from everywhere . They passed through a palmy oasis village where blue-clad federales strolled in pairs , carrying automatic pistols . The bus left the isthmus behind , winding its way upward from the coast , around hairpin turns overlooking gorges threaded by narrow green rivers . It passed humbling vistas , the aridity extending range upon blue desert range into the haze . He saw tall organ cacti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he road , and was thankful for the air conditioning and the room to stretch his legs , thankful for the two liters of water and fruit in his bag , the book in his lap . He closed his eyes again and did his best to sleep . He was thankful . <p>
