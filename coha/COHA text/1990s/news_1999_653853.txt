<p> Two months ago , when Howard Milstein and Daniel Snyder agreed to buy the Washington Redskins for a stunning $800 million , it looked as if nothing could stand in the way of their dream of owning a National Football League team . <p> After all , the Milstein family 's real estate and banking fortune is estimated at $5 billion , so Mr. Milstein clearly believes he can afford paying more than three times the sales price of the last operational N.F.L. franchise to change hands : $250 million for the Minnesota Vikings last year . <p> " This is for all of us the most exciting thing we have ever done and most likely ever will do , " Mr. Milstein said upon signing the deal to buy the team from the estate of Jack Kent Cooke , the former owner , who died in 1997 . <p> But Mr. Milstein , whose brother , Edward , is also a partner in the deal , has faced unexpectedly stiff resistance . The league first looked for a way to consider a $680 million bid made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the Cooke estate 's binding agreement with the Milsteins forced it to drop that idea . <p> The deal remains in doubt as the N.F.L. 's finance committee prepares to meet today at the Arizona Biltmore in Scottsdale . The committee will determine whether Mr. Milstein has met the league 's demands that the team itself not be used as collateral for a $400 million unsecured line of credit from the French bank Societe Generale , which has lent to several other N.F.L. team owners . The league is also asking Howard and Edward Milstein each to be individually responsible for the loan . <p> Societe Generale has agreed to take certain Milstein family assets if the loan goes bad , without putting Howard Milstein or the Washington team at risk . <p> " They sent us a letter saying they will comply , but without any specific timetable or substantive support documents , " said Joe Browne , the N.F.L. 's senior vice president for communications and government relations . <p> The league 's full 31-team ownership is scheduled to vote on the deal on Tuesday . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more owners  --  Mr. Milstein and his partners will lose not only their contract for the team but also a $30 million nonrefundable deposit held by the Cooke estate . <p> " This is rich man 's poker , " said Rick Burton , director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center , part of the business school at the University of Oregon . " It must have been very important to them to pay this much , maybe overbidding by $100 million . " <p> Overbidding or not , the cost of playing N.F.L. poker is climbing . Spurred by network television deals that will total $18.3 billion through 2005 , team values are soaring . In 1993 the expansion teams in Jacksonville , Fla. , and Charlotte , N.C. , paid fees of $140 million each to join the league . Two years later , Malcolm Glazer acquired the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for $192 million . Last year , Red McCombs snapped up the Minnesota Vikings for $250 million . <p> " If not for the TV deals , teams would still sell for $200 million , " said Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two groups from Los Angeles are also competing for that team , which would be the league 's 32d franchise and could go for at least $600 million , experts say . The N.F.L. is expected to decide next week whether to expand . <p> The latest television package  --  the networks paid each team in the league $54.8 million last year and will pay them almost twice that amount , $90 million , in 2005  --  changed everything . Last September , for example , the N.F.L. reaped $530 million for selling the rights to re-establish the Browns in Cleveland . The price capitalized on the team 's new worth in view of the television package as well as on the revenue to be derived from a new stadium . The new Browns will start play this fall . <p> But even that $530 million bonanza , which will be shared among the current team owners , fell far short of the value perceived in the Redskins . The Milstein-Snyder partnership , and the rivals they outbid , recognized that the team was worth a lot more because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in suburban Maryland , opened in 1997 and is a model of modern sports finance . The 80,116-seat stadium was built by the late Mr. Cooke for $180 million ( the state paid $70 million for infrastructure work ) . It boasts the league 's most expensive tickets ( $52.92 on average ) , most luxury suites ( 280 , which sell for $59,950 to $159,950 ) and most club seats ( 15,044 at $995 to $1,995 ) . <p> In 1996 , the last year the Redskins played at the District-owned R.F.K. Stadium in Washington , it earned $213,455 on revenue of $79.3 million . By 1998 , the team 's second season at the new stadium , the pre-season estimate for combined team and stadium revenue was $141.2 million , with net income of $21.6 million . All this for a team that finished the season next to last in its division . <p> And although players ' salaries are rising , the revenue potential at Cooke stadium has not been fully exploited . Revenue from advertising , for example , is relatively low . Not all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name has not been sold to a corporation , which could generate at least $5 million a year . And dozens more luxury suites could be built if there was demand . <p> Mr. Milstein 's pursuit of the Redskins is not his first N.F.L. go-round . Last year he joined the auction for the re-established Browns . He withstood the league 's security and financial investigations and proposed financing his deal with the same line of credit that is at the center of the Redskins purchase . He signed a prospective buyer 's contract and put up a $45 million letter of credit . But his $450 million bid finished third to the $530 million price that was paid by Alfred Lerner . <p> For the last 14 months , Mr. Milstein and his brother have owned 45 percent of the New York Islanders , a stake they must sell to join the N.F.L. The hockey foray turned sour quickly when talks to build a new arena collapsed . The team even temporarily abandoned the Coliseum , where it plays , in a dispute over safety . <p> Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his Browns bid , then on the Redskins . But the league 's approval process has bewildered the Milstein camp , people involved in the negotiations say , forcing the Milsteins to wonder if questions of personality and business style  --  not finances  --  are really behind the delay . <p> Mr. Milstein and his partners would not comment for this article . <p> " Listen , if we voted for personality , we 'd have a four-team league , " said Art Modell , who moved the Cleveland team to Baltimore in 1996 and renamed it the Ravens , leaving behind the Browns name and colors . <p> The Milsteins have squabbled with the league over how easily their real estate assets could be extricated from family partnerships if the team 's finances collapsed . They have also fought over the amount of cash or equity they are putting into the purchase , and whether financing secured by debt-free real estate is essentially equity . <p> The league , which lets owners borrow up to $100 million against their teams , would prefer that any prospective new owners bankroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as did Mr. Lerner , who is chairman of MBNA Inc. , the credit card issuer , and Mr. McCombs , a co-founder of Clear Channel Communications . <p> " This is the most highly leveraged purchase in the history of team sports in this country , " Mr. Browne , the N.F.L. official , said of the Milstein deal , " and we want to make sure that Societe Generale is n't our partner if something happens financially to the Milsteins . " <p> Robert K. Kraft , owner of the New England Patriots and chairman of the finance committee , said : " I do n't think there 's any doubt of Mr. Milstein 's significant net worth , but you have the question of liquidity . And I do n't think anyone questions Howard 's ability to do an excellent job . But this is a complex transaction , and we want security between the team and the lender . " <p> Mr Modell said that rejecting Mr. Milstein might expose the league to a lawsuit of " monumental proportions . " <p> In fact , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would put the proceeds of the sale in an educational foundation , might have a claim against the league because of its binding agreement with the Milstein group . In January , the estate rejected the league 's request to consider John Kent Cooke 's bid even if though it was not the top one . <p> " The trustees want to receive the sale proceeds as soon as possible , " said Stuart Haney , one of the trustees for the foundation . <p> If Mr. Milstein loses , the estate would at least have to start a new sale process , which could take months . Still , league officials say they are not worried about the prospect of costly litigation . " You ca n't conduct business being concerned about lawsuits , " Mr. Browne said about the Cooke estate 's possibly challenging a rejection in court . " The N.F.L. has to do what 's right . " <p> The contentiousness and pace of the process have led various Washington politicians to press the N.F.L. commissioner , Paul Tagliabue , to expedite the approval process . Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as head of a local business group , wrote a letter to Mr. Tagliabue . So did Senator Joseph I. Lieberman , Democrat of Connecticut , and Representative Edward J. Markey , a Democrat from Massachusetts . Senator Robert G. Torricelli , Democrat of New Jersey , and Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , also chimed in by calling Mr. Tagliabue . <p> One point of contention has concerned the N.F.L. 's hiring of a company run by Terry Lenzner , a private detective , to check Mr. Milstein 's background . Mr. Lenzner once served as a Watergate prosecutor and was hired by the Clinton White House last year to investigate potential witnesses in the Monica Lewinsky investigation . By contrast , the N.F.L. used in-house staff to investigate the seven bidders , including Mr. Milstein , who vied for the Browns . <p> But when the staff looked at the Redskins proposal , Mr. Browne said , it recommended that " further review would be required if the Milstein group were the eventual winner . " <p> It is unclear how the dispute will end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a powerfully good reason to pre-empt him , " said Mr. Modell , the Baltimore Ravens owner . " But if this is an attempt to discourage him from going forward , they chose the wrong guy . " <p> http : //www.nytimes.com Chart : " TOUCHDOWN " With the N.F.L. 's new television contract , the business of owning a football team has soared in value .
