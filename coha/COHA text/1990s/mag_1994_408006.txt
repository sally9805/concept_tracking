Mila 's mom made chicken with gravy for dinner and it was so good . Can we have gravy sometimes ? " There 's a baby who lives at Alicia 's house but it 's her sister 's , not her mother 's . How can that be ? " It was awesome at David 's house . We were jumping off the shed roof ! " By school age , if not before , your child will be making and visiting his own friends . It 's a whole new world  --  one that you 're not a part of . And if your child 's preschool social visits were pretty much limited to the children of your friends and neighbours , his new play dates with families you 've never met can sometimes cause a little parental anxiety . It 's something I 've had to work hard on as the kids have grown  --  from having it so home - based , where you can really know everything they 're doing and who they 're doing it with , to letting them head off on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight - year - old Beth and six - year - old Ben . " As they start to push out , I find it kind of scary , although it 's getting easier . " Nevertheless Judi , like most parents , feels that exposure to different families is very valuable for kids : " I think a lot of it is really exciting stuff . They learn that families do things differently , that there 's no one right way . They learn tolerance , to get along with others  --  in fact , I wish my kids had more opportunity to be friends with people whose traditions are really different from our own . " Kate Haines , mother of four children from five to 15 , agrees . " It broadens their horizons , " she says . " Sometimes other parents will do neat things with the kids that we do n't do . One family my son visits is into nature hikes and birdwatching , and has really encouraged his interest in birds . And they get exposed to other ethnic backgrounds  --  my daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in their holiday celebrations . " The picture is not always perfectly rosy , though . Some family differences are great enough to cause real concern . Movies crop up a lot , " says Judi . " We keep a pretty tight rein at home on what the kids can see and ca n't see , and sometimes we 'll be talking at bedtime and hear what they saw at someone 's house and I 'll think , " Oh , my God , you watched Terminator II ? ' But I let it go  --  these things are part of the adventure , and not that serious . But then there is bottom - line safety stuff  --  like once I discovered that there was no adult supervision where Ben was visiting . I went rightover and took him home and explained that that was not acceptable , that he simply ca n't go when there 's no adult at home . " Kate , too , has had cause to worry about the safety of her kids . " We know of one family in particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . How does she handle it ? " I talk obliquely to one of the parents  --  " What are you going to be doing this afternoon ? '  --  to try to make sure there will be a parent home and on hand to keep an eye on things . Sometimes I say Solomon can go for just a little while . Sometimes I invite the kids to come to our house instead . And I talk to Solomon about what he 's heading into  --  that he has to be careful , think for himself , and not just follow his friend 's lead . " That 's a good skill to foster early , because it becomes more and more critical as kids head into the teen years . " I tell my kids that if they ever feel uncomfortable in a situation , they should call home or come home , " says Judi . " They have to know they can bail out if they need to . " Exposure to other families inevitably leads kids to campaign for " advantages " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more TV time , or " better " school lunches . ( Funny how they do n't also beg to adopt stricter table manners , earlier bedtimes or more chores ! ) Judi and Kate handle most of these arguments with the time - honoured rebuttal : " People do things differently . But this is our family , and we decide how we 're going to live and what works for us . " Both hasten to add that they try to be flexible about reasonable ideas and suggestions the children bring home . In fact , Kate and her husband , Andrew , have had to give some " flexibility lessons " to their kids , as well : " When Bridget ( now 15 ) was starting school , we were vegetarians  --  and she found it difficult to eat at her friends ' houses . We tried to assure her that it was OK to eat whatever they were having , but she was automatically critical of them  --  feeling that they should n't eat meat , and that she should tell them so . We finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the kids would be more comfortable in other people 's homes . " Whether it 's adapting to a new city , a new job , or a new culture , " fitting in " is a skill that stands any adult in good stead . Kids who can visit comfortably with all kinds of families are on their way towards a lifetime of enjoying people  --  in all their splendid variety .
