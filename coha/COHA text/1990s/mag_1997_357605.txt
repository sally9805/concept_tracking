She came of age not in Kabul or Luanda or any other of a number of cities where the trauma of war would have given impetus to her quest to eradicate the legacies of the battlefield . Rather , Jody Williams spent much of her life in the serene , clapboard-church-dotted hamlet of Putney , Vt. , where , last Friday , the day after her 47th birthday , she received word that she had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . <P> Forthright and irreverent , Williams emerged from her farmhouse to greet the press in jeans , a tank top and bare feet . She shares the $1 million award with her six-year-old coalition , the International Campaign to Ban Landmines ( ICBL ) , which has helped persuade nearly 100 governments to support a treaty to end the production , sale and stockpiling of land mines and to clean up existing minefields around the world . The explosive devices , which can cost as little as $3 apiece and are strewn haphazardly in places like Angola , Cambodia and Bosnia , are responsible for killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the land-mine issue may seem far removed from the lives of many Americans , the urgency of Williams ' work is quite clear to a victim like Marianne Holtz of Boise , Idaho , who lost her legs and half her face to the explosives while working with refugees in Zaire . " As a weapon of war , the land mine is inexcusable , " says Holtz . " It kills women and children . It kills people long after any battle is over . There is absolutely no argument for it that is valid . " Jody Williams is dedicated to ensuring that everyone comes around to that way of thinking . <P> She has not , however , persuaded the U.S. to disown the mines . From her lawn last week , Williams had harsh words for President Clinton , who has refused to sign the treaty until it makes an exception for U.S. land-mine use along the uneasy border between North and South Korea , where 37,000 American soldiers are stationed , and for the use of antipersonnel mines in conjunction with antitank mines . Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton does not want to be on the side of humanity . " And she found it odd that he had not yet called to congratulate her . " I think if the President can call the winner of the Super Bowl , he should call the Nobel Peace Prize winner . " If he does call , she knows what she 'll say : " What 's your problem ? " <P> But even as the White House reaffirmed its " rock-solid " position against participation in the accord , Williams was heartened by the news that the once recalcitrant Russia would support the international land-mine ban . The treaty , to be signed in Ottawa in December , will go into effect after 40 nations have ratified it . <P> What is remarkable about Williams ' effort is the speed with which she and her organization have accomplished their mission . Williams was hired by the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation in 1991 to form an anti-land mine coalition . " When we began , we were just three people sitting in a room , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fruits of her labor resulted in the ICBL , an alliance of more than 1,000 anti-land mine groups . Early on , a participant predicted that it would take at least 30 years for a land-mine ban to be enacted .
