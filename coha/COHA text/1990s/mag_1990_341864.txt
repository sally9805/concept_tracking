Imagine a fuel that is clean burning , easy to produce and sells for far less than petroleum . The U.S. has a generous supply of just such a fuel : natural gas , also known as methane . Neglected during the 1980s because of abundant supplies of cheap crude , gas has suddenly become an attractive alternative again . With the Middle East crisis pushing petroleum prices to $30 per bbl. , energy experts and environmentalists have begun urging greater development of natural gas to wean the U.S. from its heavy dependency on crude oil . <P> The U.S. has enough natural gas in the ground to last 60 years at the current rate of consumption . Right now the fuel supplies about 24% of daily U.S. energy use , vs. 42% for petroleum products . Only a modest increase in gas production would be needed to replace the 750,000 bbl. a day of interrupted oil supply from Iraq and Kuwait . Gas already has many applications : heating , cooking and generating electricity . But energy experts are working on new ways in which the fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles . Predicts Michel Halbouty , a Houston wildcatter : " Gas will be the nation 's key energy supplier . We have lots of it , and there 's a load more to be found . " <P> Sometimes discovered in conjunction with crude , natural gas  --  a colorless mixture of methane and other hydrocarbons  --  was long considered worthless and burned off at the wellhead . In the postwar years , its price was so tightly regulated by the Federal Government that producers were discouraged from searching for the fuel . After prices were deregulated in the 1980s , the low cost of petroleum helped keep gas prices depressed . Wholesale natural gas sells for about $1.50 per 1,000 cu . ft. , the equivalent of $9 per bbl. for oil . Observes T. Boone Pickens , a major oil-and-gas producer : " At that price , there 's no way that exploration will ever start again . " <P> Now a combination of environmental concerns and escalating oil prices is heating up interest . The biggest problem will be getting the fuel to market . With natural-gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million-mile network of pipelines that haul gas from the fields to users is inadequate . Much of the current system is geared to serving old Rust Belt users , while the greatest need for increased supply is on the East and West coasts . But construction plans have been stalled by environmental opposition  --  ironic considering the good safety record of the transmission companies  --  as well as the lumbering federal bureaucracy . Complains Theodore Eck , chief economist of Amoco , owner of the largest U.S. natural-gas reserves : " The endless hearings and harassment and bureaucratic red tape are excessive . " <P> ! The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , which oversees the industry , is pondering proposals for 35 major construction projects . According to industry estimates , these pipelines could displace about 900,000 bbl. of oil a day . Most bitterly debated is the Iroquois pipeline , a 370-mile-long conduit that would bring Canadian gas to six Northeastern states . A coalition of environmentalists , heating-oil dealers and U.S. gas producers is fighting the project . But last week an administrative-law judge supported FERC 's preliminary approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
