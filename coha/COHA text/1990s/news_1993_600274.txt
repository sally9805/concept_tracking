<p> " GQ Bob , " nattily attired in a dark olive double-breasted suit , gold ring and watch , strolls quickly into Digital Equipment 's offices here , greets a visitor and test sips the coffee . <p> " It 's not warm enough , " Robert " GQ Bob " Palmer cajoles a nervous Digital employee . " One thing I always insist upon is that my coffee be hot . " A new pot of hot coffee suddenly appears . <p> Palmer , the new CEO at the USA 's second-biggest computer maker , knows how to get his way . Since taking the helm at Digital on Oct. 1 , Palmer has cut payroll , split the company into separate divisions and hired a management team comprised mostly of outsiders . Voila ! <p> Experts say that after six quarters of red ink , Digital will post a healthy profit in its fourth quarter , ending late June . Since October , Digital stock has risen 20% . It closed Tuesday at $ 46 3/4 , up 7/8 - still a fraction of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 . <p> Under founder and longtime President Ken Olsen , Digital 's staff was bloated . Revenue was slowly evaporating . Customers were replacing Digital 's midrange computers with faster and cheaper personal computers from IBM , Apple and Compaq . <p> Even worse , Digital was like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit . Employees found every conceivable way to avoid facing facts . Digital 's swamp-thick bureaucracy failed to act swift ly and mercilessly . <p> Then Palmer arrived . Nicknamed GQ ( as in Gentlemen 's Quarterly ) because of his penchant for designer suits , Palmer , 52 , is a fastidious dresser , a divorced father of two and a workaholic who runs five or six times a week . Palmer began to take a cleaver to one of the computer industry 's most entrenched corporate cultures . <p> Palmer says the days of waffling at Digital are over . Clarity is the new buzzword . <p> " My own style is to be very direct , very clear , " Palmer said Tuesday in his first major interview since taking charge . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save 90,000 jobs . " <p> Unlike Olsen , Palmer welcomes internal debate and tolerates opposing views . But only to a point . Technology chief Bill Strecker described Palmer 's management style this way : " This is not a consensus process - you either sign up for the strategy or seek employment elsewhere . " <p> So far , Palmer 's premise is working . Digital is far from being a healed company . But under Palmer , Digital has a core strategy for the 1990s . Among its major points : <p> - Cost control . Since 1991 , Digital has cut its worldwide workforce more than 25% to roughly 98,000 employees . Further payroll cuts may be necessary but nowhere near that magnitude . In Digital 's second quarter , expenses grew at a slower pace than revenue - for the first time since 1988 . <p> - Building a top-notch team . Digital last month landed Ed Lucente , a 31-year veteran of IBM once rumored to be the successor to former IBM CEO John Akers . Lucente joined Digital as head of its worldwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palmer goes out of his way to praise Adriana Stadecker , Digital 's new vice president of executive operations . Stadecker , 46 , is one of the highest-ranking women in the computer industry . Palmer also recruited Enrico Pesatori , former head of PC maker Zenith Data Systems , to take charge of Digital 's burgeoning PC business . <p> - Focus on superfast desktop computers . Palmer says the Alpha computer chip will serve as the brains of most Digital computers for 25 years . Based on **33;198;TOOLONG , or RISC , technology , the Alpha chip makes Digital 's workstations the fastest in that $ 10 billion-a-year market . Digital also will introduce a line of RISC-based PCs this year . Those models are expected to be faster than PCs powered by Intel chips , which dominate the industry . <p> But Digital wo n't abandon its Intel-based PCs . Within the next week , it and other PC makers will announce a line of PCs equipped with Intel 's powerful Pentium chip . <p> Why has Palmer been able to accomplish so much so fast ? Limiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions at Digital now are made by an executive team of just 25 people . By contrast , the launching of the Alpha chip - Palmer 's own project - was staffed by a team of 100 . Another plus : Digital watchers say Palmer has the proper blend of technology and marketing experience - and the ability to shake things up . <p> Palmer came to Digital in 1985 but has never fit the Digital mold . A native of the tiny peanut-farming community of Gorman , Texas , Palmer became high-school valedictorian despite leaving his family at age 15 and supporting himself through high school . After graduating from Texas Tech University , Palmer joined chipmaker Texas Instruments , leaving in 1969 to start his own chipmaking company , Mostek . He sold Mostek to United Technologies in 1980 for $ 400 million , pocketing a small fortune . <p> Experts say that background gives Palmer an edge over CEOs like Louis Gerstner of IBM , who previously worked at RJR Nabisco and American Express . Palmer is the only CEO at a major U.S. computer maker who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where staying ahead requires doubling a chip 's processing power every 18 months . <p> " That 's the last bastion of rough-and-tumble capitalism , which means he 's well-qualified for the computer industry , " says Chuck Casale , chairman of the Boston-based Aberdeen Group , which tracks Digital . <p> Palmer also knows , from personal experience , how Digital works - or does n't . He led Digital 's first effort to cut costs , closing several factories in the late 1980s and sometimes selling them off to employees . But he steered clear of infighting . <p> " Somehow he never seemed to be caught up in the internal politics of who was going to replace Ken Olsen , " Casale says . " His name was n't ever rumored - he was just ( picked by Olsen in July ) out of the blue . " <p> The secret of Palmer 's success , industry analysts say , is his ability to move Digital closer to customers and make quick but reasoned decisions . <p> " He 's really trying to turn around the culture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of customers , " says Robert Herwick , a computer analyst at Hambrecht &; Quist . " The ( Digital manager ) who sells computers to department stores ( Francis Arnone , former CEO of Marshall 's department stores ) comes out of the retail sector , for example . " <p> Yet for all the changes Palmer has brought to Digital , he still faces an intractable problem : how to make the business grow . In an age of commodity PCs that keep robbing Digital and IBM of its core customers , " the business model has radically changed , " Palmer says . " The introduction of microcomputer chips has totally changed the paradigm that companies like IBM and Digital had been so successful operating within . " <p> Palmer says there 's only so much he can do . Revenue will be flat in fiscal 1993 , and he wo n't say what business will be like in 1994 . " In order to be sustainably profitable , we have to grow the revenue , and this is going to be extremely difficult , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Digital is in , much like an engineer trying to solve a puzzle . " It 's a fascinating problem and extremely challenging . There 's just an incredible number of things to do . " <p> Computer Stock climbs Oct .
