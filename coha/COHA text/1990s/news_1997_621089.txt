<p> Since he first came to the Bay Area in the mid-1970s , physicist Jack Sarfatti has been a provocative presence in local intellectual life . <p> Leaping from North Beach cafes to leading policy think-tanks , he has cut a broad intellectual swath , challenging the preconceptions of poets , political thinkers and physicists alike . <p> With a background in quantum theory , he claims to break new ground in scientific understanding of the eternal questions : " Who are we ? Where do we come from ? Where are we going ? " <p> In this interview , he discusses the breakdown of a paradigm that , for centuries in the West , has viewed science and humanistic thought as irrevocably separated . <p> Q : Let 's begin with the paradigm of the two cultures . I think most of us who grew up in the 1950s and ' 60s were taught that in the intellectual world , science and the humanities were radically different . <p> A : The literary culture was thought to be more of a culture of feeling and intuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was really the basic thing . Science was highly mathematical , linear thinking , where the artistic and the creative side , the poetry , was all in the nonscientific world . <p> . <p> Q : Intellectuals in science and in the nonscientific fields did n't talk to each other very much ? <p> A : Not only did they not talk to each other , as I can remember from my own adolescence and attitude . . . . But at Cornell in the 1950s , all these bright science kids on full scholarship funded by the Defense Department would go on and on about how weak-minded and un-macho the literature students were . There was a definite sense of superiority , involving both sides against each other . There was a real split . <p> . <p> Q : Cornell had great scientific figures in the physics department , like Hans Bethe and Philip Morrison , and in the literature department , you had Vladimir Nabokov , one of the greatest modern authors . So there was ground on both sides of the divide for a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even among the professors . If you look at Richard Feynman 's books , and Feynman was a great mathematical and physics genius , he talks about the philosophers , and he makes fun of the Cornell philosophy department . You can see the conflict , the divide , in Feynman 's autobiography , " Surely You 're Joking , Mr. Feynman ! " which sold millions of copies . <p> . <p> Q : Feynman had a somewhat snobbish and arrogant attitude , about hard science as compared with philosophy and literature . But at the same time you 're describing books by him that are best-sellers . So Feynman , who started out from the position of rigid division between the scientific intellect and the nonscientific intellect , ended up breaking through that division ? <p> A : Of course , Feynman 's saving grace in this regard was that he was a comedian , he was very theatrical , musical . He was artistic himself . <p> Feynman died of a cancer that he got because at Alamogordo , at the test of the first atomic bomb in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  his young wife had just died . It was very romantic  --  he stood up as the blast went off and irradiated himself . Feynman later spent time with John Lilly experiencing psychedelic drugs at Esalen . I have seen unpublished poetry that Feynman wrote toward the end of his life and his accounts of mystical experiences at Esalen while under the influence of certain substances . <p> . <p> Q : Feynman , then , found a way through the gap between the two cultures . But perhaps the gap between the two was narrower than people thought . We define modernity , modern ideas and the modern intellectual landscape as created by Lenin , Freud , Marcel Duchamp and Einstein . The new physics was originally baffling to the world , but that very bafflement , in a way , ended up making it part of the common store of the modernist intellect , because it was so novel , right there with psychoanalysis , surrealism , with 20th century radical politics . Would you say that the ideas of a new physics eventually became part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A : Absolutely . Physicists , because of their great intellectual honesty , were forced , kicking and screaming , across the divide . They really had no choice . <p> It was not only Einstein that pushed them in that direction , but the later discoveries of quantum physics , primarily due to Niels Bohr . Bohr was the leader , who pushed people into this kind of surrealist view of the world , pushed the physicists themselves , even if they did n't want to be there . <p> They were very happy in the old classical , pre-Einsteinian physics of the 17th to 19th centuries . <p> . <p> Q : Describe the intellectual world and the physical world before Einstein . <p> A : That world was  --  it 's already a cliche  --  a clockwork universe , where the cosmos was a great machine , in which if you gathered enough information at any moment in time , you could predict with certainty every aspect of the future history of the universe . <p> It was a completely determined universe , like a great clock ticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was that there was an absolute time and there was nothing you could do about it ; and there was empty space , and there were these hard little particles moving around in space and there were these fields , electromagnetic fields , force fields , everywhere in space , which helped move these particles , helped accelerate the particles . <p> There was certainly no room for life and mind as a physical phenomenon . There was no way within the classical physics of the 17th and 19th century to account for life itself . <p> You had the idea of the elan vital , the vitalist movement in biology . It was thought that life itself must be something beyond the physical , beyond the laws of physics ; there was some other level . <p> And , of course , that also helped fuel the divide between the two cultures because , certainly , on the poetic , literary side of the two cultures , they thought they had a monopoly on the spirit and consciousness . Because that was the beyond . They were right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics that could account for consciousness within physics . And you had an external God and all that stuff . <p> . <p> Q : So then one day , a man came along and basically said the universe was not a traditional clock at all , and his name was Albert Einstein . <p> A : Einstein is a complex figure . Suddenly , when he was in his early 20s , with his theory of relativity , he revolutionized our ideas of time and space and matter and energy . Or you could say Einstein saw the universe as a clock , but it was a Salvador Dali " soft watch , " a kind of surrealist cosmos , because time was stretching , because time was not absolute anymore . <p> For example , Einstein talked about a moving clock . If the clock was moving very close to the speed of light , the clock would look as though it were running slow . If you had a meter stick that was moving past you close to the speed of light , the meter stick would contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will not contract perpendicular to motion , but in the direction of motion . <p> So , space would squeeze down , and time would stretch out . <p> . <p> Q : So it 's not an orderly and predictable universe , by our standards . <p> A : Not in quantum theory ; but all relativity does is stretch time . There 's no such thing as absolute time in relativity anymore . Or space ; time and space are relative . You can literally travel in time , or , at least , introduce the idea of time travel . You can time travel to the future . And that 's standard physics . <p> With what Einstein did in his relativity theory , there is still a kind of determinism . So it 's a machine . It 's not a rigid machine , it 's a more flexible machine . But in relativity , it 's still a machine . <p> That 's the important part . Relativity is still a machine-like theory ; it is like classical physics , but changes our notions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass to energy , leading to things like the atomic bomb . <p> . <p> Q : The 1920s was a period of great cultural ferment . Einstein in a strange sense is a sort of Lenin of science ; he 's this dramatic , revolutionary figure who breaks down all of the accepted institutions . The Nazis denounced Einstein as Jewish science , but other reactionaries denounced Einstein for overthrowing the universe as they knew it . Is Niels Bohr the next figure who you feel brought forward an idea that could also be grasped in general and intellectual terms ? <p> A : Bohr really introduced epistemology or idealism , idealistic thought , into modern physics , because of the paradoxes of the quantum theory and the breakdown of determinism . The breakdown of the clockwork universe upset a lot of physicists . <p> Bohr had a very dominating personality , like Socrates . He could talk anybody under the table . Bohr got everyone to agree with him except one man , and that was Albert Einstein . The Einstein/Bohr debate went on for the rest of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is a reality out there ; there is something real to talk about . Bohr would say that , basically , all we can do with physics is predict correlations between mental experiences , the experiences of the observer . Bohr brought mind into center stage in the world of physics . <p> Even though Einstein was a revolutionary in some ways , he was conservative at the same time . <p> . <p> Q : One can say that all of the great revolutionary figures in culture have a very radical side and also a very conservative side . <p> A : Let 's put it this way : paradox . The idea of paradox is an essential part of quantum theory , the new physics . But it 's only paradox relative to the old classical ideas of either/or . If you have a world of either/or , then the new physics , quantum physics , goes beyond the either/or and you have to play with paradox and understand that paradox from the either/or point of view . If you think quantum mechanically , you just accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bohr introduced a certain " necessity of irrationality " in the new physics . Bohr said : " Do n't even try to conceive of certain things . " In classical physics , we had the idea of particles moving continuously in space through time . In principle , you can picture every little detail of that . Bohr said : " At the quantum level , you ca n't do that anymore . Renounce it . You ca n't do it . You can not think of a particle , little particles , moving through space and time at the quantum level . That 's only like a classical approximation . And thou shalt not think that way at the quantum level . " <p> This was amazing  --  and Einstein did n't like it , at all . This is the basis of the Einstein/Bohr debate . Can you picture detailed processes in space and time at the quantum level ? Bohr says no ; Einstein says yes , there should be a way . <p> What Einstein said was , the quantum theory that Bohr and Werner Heisenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be a complete theory , because there must be a deeper point of view where you can picture individual processes in a detailed way . <p> . <p> Q : That 's supposed to be what science is . It 's supposed to be the naturalistic description of the universe . <p> A : Einstein still held to that kind of objective , detailed picture of things . <p> . <p> Q : And Bohr said that the highest triumph of science is to recognize that you ca n't do science in that way . <p> A : That debate is still going on today . <p> . <p> Q : An interesting intersection between the two cultures has recently emerged . A Shakespeare scholar , Jonathan Bate , has published an article showing that the English writer William Empson , one of the most influential literary critics of the 20th century , began in mathematics and physics . When Empson wrote his most famous book , " Seven Types of Ambiguity , " he was attempting to translate into literary criticism the ideas about the physical universe of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicist Paul Dirac . <p> A : Dirac was a very shy , rather artistic Englishman at Cambridge . He published a book , " Principles of Quantum Mechanics , " with a sparse beauty and elegance . Dirac was like a Japanese painter , or a maker of Zen Buddhist proverbs , or koans . <p> When you read his book , it 's like reading a great piece of poetry , like being in heaven and seeing all these beautiful forms . <p> Dirac produced the Dirac Equation , which led to the prediction of what 's called antimatter . That is , you have an electron but you also have , like a mirror image , a positron . You have a proton , but you also have an antiproton . Although Dirac at first did n't realize what he had , what this equation had , it soon became clear what it meant . <p> With antimatter , if an antiparticle meets a particle , like an electron meets a positron , they totally annihilate into radiation . So , it 's complete conversion of matter into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermined the previous conceptions of matter and energy would lend themselves to an understanding of the kind of literary ambiguity I gather Empson talked about . <p> . <p> Q : Empson was also interested in Erwin Schrodinger . <p> A : Schrodinger and Werner Heisenberg preceded Dirac . He summarized their work . <p> Schrodinger is one of the most interesting figures in all of science . He was a true Renaissance man , with a deep knowledge of eastern philosophy . He synthesized the ideas of Einstein , Bohr and another quantum physicist , Louis de Broglie . <p> With the Schrodinger Wave Equation , he more or less reconciled the phenomena of particles and waves , which had been seen as distinct , in a theory that accounted for both . This is one of the central quantum concepts . It was the birth of the modern quantum theory . <p> . <p> Q : It 's interesting that you compare Dirac with Japanese poetry and that you mention Schrodinger 's interest in eastern mysticism , because Empson went to China and Japan to work as an English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A : In the new physics , just as we see the breakdown of the split between the two cultures , science and the humanities , we also see the split between West and East breaking down , with rationalism and mysticism reconciled , as well . <p> . <p> Q : So we see the two cultures really merging , with science more and more expressed in general , intellectual terms that are part of the broader modernist culture . <p> A : The figure with the most importance for this debate right now is the person Einstein himself considered his heir , David Bohm , who died in 1992 . <p> Bohm is a remarkable personality . He started out at Berkeley with J. Robert Oppenheimer , in the 1940s . Bohm was one of those who was accused of being involved with the Soviets  --  he was not allowed to work at Los Alamos , where the atomic bomb was created . But he was incredibly important for physics today and in the future . <p> . <p> Q : The partial opening of the Soviet archives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate about the Oppenheimer circle , including Philip Morrison and Bohm . You knew Bohm in Britain ? <p> A : Bohm took the fall for Oppenheimer , to protect Oppenheimer , and left the country in order not to have to testify . He went to Brazil and then to Israel for a bit and finally to England , where I found him , at the University of London . I believe Oppenheimer betrayed Bohm . Oppenheimer sacrificed Bohm to protect himself . <p> . <p> Q : Bohm sounds like a great California figure . He begins at Berkeley ; he comes under a cloud because of his pro-Soviet associations . According to you , he ends up as the heir to Einstein , developing ideas that are extremely radical and relevant to the whole culture . What are those ideas ? <p> A : Bohm was a student of Oppenheimer 's . He was hired after the war , as a young assistant professor at Princeton . And he was assigned to teach the course in quantum theory , very much under the influence of Bohr . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He really was questing , trying to understand the universe and quantum theory philosophically . <p> He always proceeded in a clear , intuitive way . He was trying to cut through the abstract mathematics and to make contact with reality . His lecture notes for his course at Princeton became his book , " Quantum Theory . " It 's beautifully written . <p> . <p> Q : I understand there was a famous encounter between Bohm and Einstein at Princeton . <p> A : Having finished writing his book , he was walking around the campus , and he ran into Einstein . Einstein had read the book , and they spent a weekend of intensive discussions . <p> Bohm had developed what 's called the pilot wave theory , based on Einstein 's ideas . The idea was that Bohr 's quantum theory was very accurate , and you can do all kinds of practical and important technological things with it . But it 's incomplete ; it 's leaving something essential out . <p> In classical physics , you have particles and force fields , electromagnetic fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw patterns , quantum patterns , like patterns of thought . Bohm showed that a " quantum pattern of active information " is fundamental to the universe . He deals with the parts of the uni verse and the whole of the universe , and he theorizes that things that look like separate parts of the universe emerge out of a pool , which he calls the common pool of information . <p> It 's like the universe is a sea of information . And here the gap between the two cultures finally collapses altogether . Science and history , technology and intellect , all collapse into one . Because at the threshold of the 21st century , in what we call the information revolution , the information age , Bohm tells us that , in the end , the whole of reality is simply a pattern of information . <p> Nothing could be more revolutionary . <p> JACK SARFATTI <p> * 1939 : Born September 14 , Brooklyn , N.Y . <p> * 1960 : B.A. in physics , Cornell University . <p> * 1963 : Publishes paper , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cimento , Journal of the Italian Physical Society . <p> * 1967 : M.S. in physics , University of California at San Diego .
