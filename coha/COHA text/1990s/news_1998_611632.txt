<p> Washington is about to build a convention center that industry experts warn could prove to be a billion-dollar mistake . <p> The limestone and glass edifice  --  which would span nearly six city blocks at Mount Vernon Square  --  would be more than twice as large as the existing center at H and 10th streets NW . Yet it may well turn out to be too small . Even the city 's consultants predict that the new center would begin to approach full capacity just more than 10 years after it opens in 2002 , about 20 years before the bonds to finance the project would be repaid . <p> The D.C. Council has scheduled a hearing Friday to consider legislation to pay for the $ 685 million project , of which the city would fund $ 650 million and the federal government $ 35 million . The final price tag , including interest over the life of the 34-year bonds , would rise to more than $ 1 billion . <p> The city 's share would be collected from taxes on hotel rooms , restaurant meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finance the project by selling bonds backed by those taxes . <p> Most cities with which Washington competes for convention business built their centers where space could be added to keep pace with the growing market for trade shows . But the only way to expand the proposed center  --  which would extend into the Shaw neighborhood of Northwest Washington  --  would be to condemn surrounding properties , which include influential African American churches , affordable housing , historic row houses and national landmarks . Condemnation is a step city leaders say they would be unwilling to take . <p> The new center also would cost more per square foot  --  $ 296  --  than similar projects in nine cities that Washington trade show planners consider their chief rivals . Costs are rising because of design complications involved in squeezing the huge building into Shaw . The main exhibition hall would be entirely underground , an excavation requiring 100,000 dump truck trips to haul away the dirt . That many trucks would form a line stretching from Washington to Boston . <p> City planners have recognized these problems with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the project in spite of them . The cash-strapped city owned most of the land , and elected officials saw an opportunity to enhance downtown revitalization and support nearby hotels and restaurants owned by the project 's boosters . <p> When city leaders are asked why they have chosen a site that can not easily be expanded , they say that no better site exists in the District and that this location 's proximity to shopping , lodging and restaurants outweighs its flaws . Also , they say a site away from downtown would produce fewer economic benefits . <p> " There 's no such thing as a perfect site , " said Lewis H. Dawley III , general manager of the Washington Convention Center Authority . " This location is ideal for the market that we appeal to . It 's important for people staying here to be near hotels and close to the synergy of downtown Washington . " <p> City leaders promise the new center will help the entire region , generating 9,000 jobs and $ 740 million in new annual spending for the city and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflated by as much as 40 percent . <p> There is immense pressure to move quickly . Trade show specialists estimate the old center , which is too small for major conventions , is costing the region hundreds of millions of dollars in lost commerce . <p> " Washington is making a lot of mayors and city councils happy , because Washington is driving business to those cities , " said Gary LaBranche , vice president of the American Society of Association Executives . " They are eating Washington 's lunch . " <p> The convention center debate is reminiscent of the one that led to construction of the existing convention facility . Critics say the city may be on the verge of repeating the mistakes it made a decade and a half ago . <p> In December 1982 , the original Washington Convention Center opened at a cost of $ 99 million . At the gala black-tie dinner on opening night , city leaders ate fillet of beef and predicted the center would fuel economic development for years to come . <p> Today , the coarse concrete bunker near Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city still owes $ 67 million in debt repayments on the building , which council members are debating how to use once a new center opens . <p> The existing center started losing conventions to other cities in 1985 because it was too small , according to a consultant 's study at the time . <p> That came at the beginning of a convention center expansion boom across the country that has not subsided . But Washington 's center could not be expanded . On one side was New York Avenue  --  a street too important to close . On three other sides were parcels on which private developers were planning hotels , restaurants and other projects  --  precisely the sort of economic development that city leaders had hoped the center would spur . <p> The exodus of convention business was significant and painful to the city 's hospitality industry . <p> " I hated to lose , " recalled Dan Mobley , now executive director of the Washington Convention and Visitors Association , who was national sales manager at the center when it opened . " Every time a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back , I saw millions of dollars walking out of the city . You can partially fill those dates , but you ca n't fully recuperate the revenues from them . " <p> In 1986 , less than four years after the building opened , the center 's board of directors began planning for a new one . They picked the Mount Vernon Square site , and city leaders and the hospitality industry have not wavered from that original selection . <p> The city had assembled the property there for a never-built downtown campus of the University of the District of Columbia . Just as the city owned the Gallery Place parcel where MCI Center eventually was built , control of the Mount Vernon Square site was a paramount asset , said council member Charlene Drew Jarvis ( D-Ward 4 ) . <p> " Avoiding a land acquisition would control the convention center cost to the taxpayers , " Jarvis said in a recent interview . <p> Mayor Marion Barry unveiled the first detailed proposal for a convention center at Mount Vernon Square in 1990 . It was n't until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites . <p> The hospitality industry paid for a 1993 study that ratified Mount Vernon Square as the best of eight possible locations in the city . The study concluded that the advantages of Mount Vernon Square were its ownership by the city and its proximity to downtown . <p> Industry leaders made another critical commitment to the project that gave hotel and restaurant owners powerful leverage over the process . Because it was clear the city could not afford to pay for a convention center from the general fund , the industry agreed to accept tax increases on hotel rooms and restaurant meals if the money would be used to build a center at Mount Vernon Square . <p> " Our industry , like a lot of others , was waiting for political leadership to take the lead , " said Emily Vetter , president of the Hotel Association of Washington . " But if we wanted the project to move forward , we were going to have to take the lead . " <p> The hospitality industry would be one of the chief beneficiaries of the center at Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional room nights a year , and the demand would lead to construction of at least one major downtown hotel , according to the city 's consultants . They based their estimates on an increased number of convention delegates coming to Washington . <p> The next significant hurdle was to sell the project to residents and the National Capital Planning Commission , the federal agency that reviews major projects in the city . After public hearings and design revisions intended to ameliorate the building 's effects on the neighborhood , the commission approved the site last fall . <p> The planning commission 's unanimous approval of the site did not mollify the project 's opponents . <p> Some Shaw residents and urban planners insisted that the largest construction project ever undertaken by the city did not belong in the middle of a residential neighborhood . <p> They measured the potential disruption in linear feet of masonry , in rumbling tractor-trailers and in conventioneers fanning into their streets . The building 's roof line would range from 45 to 123 feet tall . The center would attract nearly 500,000 delegates a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade shows in and out . <p> The city 's schools are failing , recreation centers are ill-equipped , streets are crumbling , " and we 're going to spend $ 650 million on a convention center ? " said Shaw resident Thomas Smith . <p> Beyond the neighborhood , larger questions about design , costs and benefits persist . <p> The Mount Vernon Square site violates an important principle of convention center design , experts contend . " A center should not become site-bound , or landlocked , " consultant David C. Petersen wrote in a leading textbook on convention center planning . <p> Most cities with which Washington competes for conventions have heeded Petersen 's advice that adjacent land exist for expansion . But , for the second time , Washington is planning to build where expansion is impossible . <p> Orlando has expanded its convention center three times this decade . New Orleans is building an addition to its center . Boston is constructing a new center with adjacent acreage for expansion . Philadelphia is searching for ways to add space to its center less than five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say this is going to be the last expansion we 'll do , but we said that 10 years ago , " said John K. Smith , general manager of the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta , which is planning its third major addition , after expansions in 1985 and 1992 . <p> Even cities that built centers downtown , such as Philadelphia and New Orleans , chose sites where expansion was possible . <p> In Washington 's case , planners rejected more spacious sites that were outside downtown . They also fought fiercely against proposals to build a center in the suburbs , arguing that the city 's status as the economic core of the region would further erode if it lost the convention center . <p> Expansions are common because trade show growth has been as predictable as death and taxes for two decades . The typical show will grow 20 percent by 2001 , according to the Center for Exhibition Industry Research in Bethesda . Those who study the industry say that trend toward bigger shows will continue . <p> " You should never assume the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the road , " said Stephen Schuldenfrei , executive director of the Society of Independent Show Organizers . <p> A new center in Washington with 700,000 square feet of exhibition space would begin to approach maximum capacity within 10 years , according to the city 's consultants . The actual plans call for slightly more space than that , about 725,000 square feet , so the new center would begin to approach maximum capacity in slightly more than a decade . Kenneth Glover , one of the consultants , would not estimate precisely when the center would reach that point . <p> " For the major cities , a million square feet is fairly common , and we 're already 250,000 below that , " said Robert Harar , chairman of National Trade Productions in Alexandria . " They 're building this on a footprint that ca n't be expanded . They 're back to square one in a few years . " <p> The existing center was too small to accommodate the 50 largest shows in 1983 , and the new center would have been unable to handle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal Tradeshow Week . <p> Washington 's planners respond that the city is not striving to capture the largest shows . The target market is smaller , professional meetings , such as the American Heart Association or the American Dental Association . Washington would like to have two or three of those shows at a time . <p> But that segment of the market is growing , too . The dental and heart associations would each fill most of the proposed center with their 1998 shows . If Washington tried to handle three shows of equal size in 2002 , the center 's first year of scheduled operation , each would have to be smaller than the average show projected for that year . <p> " They 're rolling the dice on this thing , " said Steve Miller , a convention consultant with the Adventure of Trade Shows , outside Seattle . " You always have to allow yourself room for growth . . . . If you allow yourself the option , you can always say no . But they have no option . " <p> Mount Vernon Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It requires placing a quarter of the building underground , the architects say , to be able to fit more exhibition space without increasing the mass of the project visible from the street . Even so , the exhibition space would be far short of the 1 million square feet that Barry called for in 1990 . <p> Excavation is expensive , made even more so by the need to design heavy underground walls and drainage systems to keep out the ground water , as the lower exhibition hall would be beneath the water table . <p> It would be one of the biggest digs in Washington 's history . The lower hall would be larger than 10 football fields , beneath a 30-foot ceiling . <p> Allen Y. Lew , managing director of development for the Washington Convention Center Authority , said the added cost of digging underground was about $ 105 million out of the $ 501 million construction budget . The project budget of $ 685 million includes design , engineering and other costs . <p> Lew said excavation was n't the only factor inflating the budget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly Carnegie Library in Mount Vernon Square . The plans indicate the center would be much more handsome than the warehouselike structures in other cities , with extensive use of glass , limestone and granite on the outside , and wood on the inside . <p> But the layout would be less than ideal , with exhibition halls on two levels . Meeting planners say they prefer the halls on one floor , but there is insufficient space at Mount Vernon Square for that design . <p> Advocates say the costs are justified by the enormous benefits the project would bring . <p> Many Shaw residents think the center would provide jobs and business opportunities . " It 's economic stimulus , " said Rodney Foxworth , co-chairman of a neighborhood coalition . " The idea is for people who live in Shaw to capture those funds . " <p> The benefits would extend far beyond Shaw , according to the city 's consultants with Coopers &; Lybrand , who estimated that the center would spark $ 1.43 billion in annual economic activity in the region by its fifth year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , the old center would generate only about $ 690 million , so the new center would create about $ 740 million in new economic activity . It also would support about 9,000 new full- and part-time jobs , and slightly more than half the jobs and dollars would remain in the city , the consultants said . <p> Convention centers typically lose money on operations , however . Washington 's existing center lost about $ 5 million last year , and planners predict that the new center would operate at a similar deficit . <p> At the heart of the consultants ' analysis is spending by convention delegates with expense accounts . The new center would draw an estimated 500,000 such conventioneers a year , compared with 400,000 now . Delegates spend up to about $ 300 a day . <p> The consultants used economic multipliers to reflect how spending by delegates is magnified as it flows through the economy  --  dollars spent in restaurants beget dollars spent on food suppliers , and so on . For example , the consultants estimate that every dollar spent in a restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economists interviewed by The Washington Post said the consultants ' multipliers are too generous , overstating the benefits of the center by as much as 40 percent . <p> " The multipliers . . . are significantly greater than anything that I 've ever seen , " said Stephen S. Fuller , an economist at George Mason University , who said multipliers published by the U.S. Commerce Department are more reliable . <p> David Moulder , a consultant with Coopers &; Lybrand who worked on the report , said the multipliers used by his firm were developed by a private company specializing in economic analysis . <p> " We can argue about what multiplier to use , " Moulder said . " The message is that this is tremendous economic impact for the region . " <p> Project managers contend that no other site in the city would generate that kind of revenue , and some experts say being close to the city 's amenities is crucial . <p> " Successful convention centers . . . must be located within walking distance ( three to five blocks ) of hotels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote in his textbook . <p> But critics say an alternative location north of Union Station , just south of Florida and New York avenues NE , is a better bet . Last week , the Committee of 100 on the Federal City , a preservation and planning advocacy group , released a report endorsing that site . <p> Its advantages include exhibit space on one level and room to expand , the possibility of less costly above-ground construction and the opportunity to spur development up the North Capitol Street corridor . The disadvantages include a slightly greater distance from the heart of downtown , no hotels within walking distance and the possible need for construction of a Red Line Metro station and a parking garage . <p> A complete picture of that site remains elusive , however , because the city has not thoroughly studied it . An environmental impact statement conducted last year before the federal planning commission hearing did not address costs . The 1993 consultant 's study paid for by the hospitality industry identified the site as one of the three best locations in the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street between M and I streets SE . <p> That study discarded the Union Station site mainly because of supposed costs of acquisition and environmental cleanup . But the owners of the land recently offered to sell it to the District for one-third of what city officials claimed was the land 's value . The cleanup costs of the former CSX rail yard are in dispute , ranging up to more than $ 40 million . <p> " At this point , " said Tersh Boasberg , chairman of the Committee of 100 , " everybody is invested in the convention center at Mount Vernon Square and nobody wants to say we may have made a mistake .
