<p> FOXBORO , Mass.  --  Former New England safety Corwin Brown tries to describe the charged atmosphere that will fill Sunday night 's game between the Patriots and the Bill Parcells-coached New York Jets . <p> " Have you ever been to Foxboro Stadium ? " Brown , now a member of the Jets , asks about one of the loudest and rowdiest sites in the NFL . " Magnify it a couple of times . " <p> Magnify it many times because Parcells is returning to face the Patriots franchise he transformed into an AFC champion , only to leave last winter in a messy divorce without saying goodbye . <p> " I 've been through lots of these kinds of big-game weeks , " says Parcells , who joins Don Shula as the only coaches to take two different teams to Super Bowls . " Usually I can block ( distractions ) out pretty well . " <p> Unforgiving Patriots fans and players from both teams , though , keenly are aware of the bittersweet history that turns this mid-September matchup into a much-anticipated game worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> " Can The Tuna " reads T-shirts that are selling fast at a souvenir store outside Foxboro Stadium . Other shirts urge the Patriots to " Grill The Tuna . " <p> The " Tuna "  --  that 's the nickname Parcells picked up in 1980 after making a reference to the " Charlie the tuna " commercial character  --  will be ready . " I 'm a grown man , " Parcells says . " I know you do n't go through this world without getting stung once in a while . " <p> New England fans love Parcells for inheriting a team that was 2-14 in 1992 and , four seasons later , guiding it to Super Bowl XXXI last January . They hate him for a less-than-graceful exit  --  and for leaving at all . <p> In the days leading to the Super Bowl in New Orleans , they watched their beloved " Tuna " seemingly turn into an insatiable piranha . He devoured pregame attention as uncertainty about his coaching future  --  he wanted more control than he had with the Patriots  --  dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England 's 35-21 loss to Green Bay , Parcells left the impression he had turned his back on his players by never addressing them a final time . To make matters worse , he was conspicuous in his absence from the team flight home . <p> " The whole thing was a little messy , him not flying back with the team , " Patriots offensive tackle Bruce Armstrong says . " That could have been handled a little differently . " <p> Parcells says he called some players individually . But , he adds , " I do n't think there was going to be a pleasant way to end it . I tried to take the high road as much as I could . " <p> NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue mediated a dispute between the Patriots and Jets about Parcells ' right to leave . <p> Something to prove <p> Parcells ' departure to an AFC East rival aroused the Patriots more than any of his locker-room tirades . New England is 2-0 and has outscored its opponents , San Diego and Indianapolis , by a combined 72-13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fired eight touchdown passes to eight players . <p> When Bledsoe is asked if he 'll shake Parcells ' hand before Sunday 's game , he replies : " If it happens , it happens . But I 'm not going to make it a point to do that . " <p> Says cornerback Ty Law : " I think everybody wants to go out there and prove we do n't need coach Parcells to win . We want some credit , too . " <p> Parcells has something to prove as well , even after turning around the New York Giants and winning Super Bowls with them to cap the 1986 and 1990 seasons and even after taking New England to its second Super Bowl and filling once-empty seats at Foxboro . <p> He finally has the authority he always yearned for in becoming the Jets ' coach and chief of football operations . <p> And while his ability to develop players is beyond question , he must demonstrate front-office skills , specifically the evaluation of raw talent . <p> Last season , for example , New England would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions of Terry Glenn , who made an NFL rookie-record 90 catches for 1,132 yards . Yet Parcells objected when Glenn was drafted and disparaged the first-round pick by calling him " she " during preseason . <p> A tough challenge <p> Parcells , 56 , has produced a Super Bowl team at regular four-year intervals during his 12 previous years as an NFL head coach . But the Jets , the only team without a division title since the old American Football League merged with the NFL in 1970 , finished with the league 's worst record each of the previous two years and represent Parcells ' sternest challenge . <p> " This is n't going smoothly . There are going to be some rough times here , " says Parcells , who is paid $ 2.4 million by the Jets . " I expect that . " <p> The greater the rebuilding job , though , the more Parcells seems to relish it . " Jets Football ' 97 . Who Says We Ca n't ? ! ! " reads his sweatshirt . <p> Those who know Parcells well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are 1-1 and have equaled last season 's victory total . <p> " You 've got to follow Bill 's track record , " Jets guard William Roberts says of the coach who sports a 120-87-1 career mark , including playoffs . " Where he goes , he 's successful . " <p> NBC commentator Phil Simms , the Giants quarterback when Parcells molded them into champions , grows indignant at long-standing questions about the coach 's skill in evaluating talent . <p> " That has got to be the biggest crock I ever heard , " Simms says . " Where does this start ? I think his ability to judge personnel is well-documented , and it 's worked out pretty well for him . He did pick most of those players in New England . " <p> He did , and the handiwork of Parcells and his staff already is evident in New York . The Jets built confidence during a 4-0 preseason , and their 41-3 rout at Seattle was the most lopsided season-opening victory in their history . <p> Even in losing to visiting Buffalo 28-22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a vastly improved football team , " Bills coach Marv Levy says . " It 's very obvious . " <p> Promising new talent already is aboard . Rookie free-agent kicker John Hall boomed field goals of 55 and 52 yards the first two weeks ; first-round pick James Farrior has considerable potential at linebacker ; third-round choice Dedric Ward has big-play possibilities as a receiver and kick returner ; and fourth-rounder Leon Johnson is a rugged back with pass-catching skills . <p> Veterans are receptive . " Guys who have been around here awhile are fed up with losing , " quarterback Neil O'Donnell says . <p> And then there is Parcells , who pushes , prods and always has evoked strong emotions and always will . He does not care if players love him or hate him as long as they perform . <p> " Balking is not an option , " Simms says . " He always said , ' This is not a democratic society , it 's a dictatorship . So live with it .
