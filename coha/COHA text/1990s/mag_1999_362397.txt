Bassist , singer , sometime hip-hopper Me'Shell NdegeOcello created a wake-up call in her first album , Plantation Lullabies , brimming with funk and flavor and attitude . Her new CD , Bitter , is more of a good-night kiss , slow , atmospheric and a bit weepy . Bitter , which features narcoleptic production by Craig Street , has carefully structured songs and cautious vocals , but it lacks NdegeOcello 's edginess and verve . The songs are about breakups and betrayal , but the emotion is buried . This album feels like that uncomfortable pause in an argument when there 's nothing left to say or throw or do but sit quietly , crying tears of rage . <P>  --  By Christopher John Farley
