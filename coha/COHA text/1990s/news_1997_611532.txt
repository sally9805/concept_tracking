<p> Callers from as far away as Los Angeles , London and Stockholm have been jamming the Supreme Court switchboard to sound off about cases on the docket . Reporters who have never climbed the court 's wide marble steps are showing up to hear arguments . The line for courtroom seats has on some days started forming before dawn , and the lawyers ' lounge is crowded with attorneys so eager for a dose of high court repartee that they will take it in a room where oral arguments merely are piped in through a loudspeaker . <p> On occasion , the Supreme Court offers up a term that is so topical , so compelling , so downright juicy that it captures broad public interest . This is such a term . <p> " The Constitution says , ' We , the people . . . ' " Yale University law professor Akhil Amar observed , " and these cases have generated a lot more interest among the people . " <p> " It is a wonderful term , " said E. Barrett Prettyman Jr. , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law clerk , served three justices and has since argued 19 cases . " I have had more people , both lawyers and non-lawyers , close friends and mere acquaintances , ask me more questions about the court than I have in a very long time . Part of it is the news focus and part of it is the cases themselves . People think and worry about suicide , about growing old . " <p> The justices left for a midwinter recess last week but not before setting their full schedule for the term . Among the 80 cases to be decided is plenty of sex , death , guns , race and religion . <p> It is a lineup that puts attention on an institution that loathes the limelight . Cameras are not allowed in the courtroom . Note-taking is prohibited in public sections . When the justices vote on cases , they do it in secret . <p> But while the ways of the black-robed justices may be a mystery to the public , what they decide can have a dramatic impact on people 's lives . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent example of the recurring force of the court came Wednesday , the day after the justices left town , when tens of thousands of protesters marched here to mark the 24th anniversary of the court 's decision in Roe v. Wade to legalize abortion nationwide . <p> The week before , the nation 's news pages and airwaves were filled with pictures and prose about Paula Corbin Jones , whose sexual harassment case against President Clinton is now before the high court . The legal question the justices will decide is not whether Clinton is guilty of something but whether he can be required to stand trial while he is still president . But the constitutionality of it all has not diminished interest in the case . <p> Hugh Davies , a reporter for the London Daily Telegraph , decided for the first time in a decade of serving as Washington correspondent to step inside the Supreme Court , thanks to Jones . " I wanted to get the flavor of this very controversial case , " he said . " I thought , I 'll pop up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dreary wade through constitutional muddle . What he got was a lively debate about the pros and cons of allowing a lawsuit against a sitting president to go forward . " I thought it was going to be dry as dust , " Davies said , " but it was n't at all . The justices immediately started questioning the lawyers , taking part in the discussion very , very quickly . " <p> Such vigorous questioning also occurred when the justices took up a case last month on a Kansas law that forces sexual predators to be institutionalized even after they have served prison sentences . Reflecting the national concern over sex offenders who prey on children , close to 40 states and the District of Columbia filed a " friend of the court " brief urging the justices to find the law constitutional . <p> But it was the high profile " right to die " case , over whether the terminally ill have a right to commit suicide with help of a physician , that drew the most individual amicus curiae briefs  --  52  --  this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are trying to influence the justices ' ultimate decision . <p> When the high court heard arguments in the case earlier this month , for the first time since officials there can remember , there was not enough room in the elbow-to-elbow press section for all the reporters who wanted to attend . <p> The justices have shown signs of the strain that public attention can bring . They have been testier with lawyers and less patient with each other . During oral arguments on whether state candidates can be forced to take a drug test before getting on the ballot , Justice Antonin Scalia began , as he regularly does , answering some of the questions put to the lawyer at the lectern . <p> Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist snapped at Scalia , " He is capable of answering himself . " Scalia turned to the chief and tried to defend his actions , breaking with the usual decorum of the room . <p> Some justices have said privately how " intense " a time it is for them . <p> Professor Amar noted the court in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of the mid-1980s ) : " I think it actually has been in some ways trying to lower its profile . But this is a court that is having visibility thrust upon it . " <p> It would have been nearly impossible for the justices to have refused to hear the Paula Jones case , given the huge institutional interests of the presidency , or to have turned down review of a daring lower court ruling that found in favor of physician-assisted suicide . <p> Congress 's effort to ban indecent materials on the Internet comes to the court March 19 . Predictably , the case has generated huge interest on the computer network that connects millions of people around the world . <p> The Center for Democracy and Technology , a high-technology policy and civil liberties group , said 57,400 people signed an online petition supporting an American Civil Liberties Union-led challenge to the Communications Decency Act of 1996 . Immediately following a 1996 lower court ruling that the act violates free speech , a central site for information on the case received a million " hits " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before , " said Jonah Seiger of the Center for Democracy and Technology . <p> This is also an unusually important term for the federal government . Several acts of Congress hang in the balance , including the Brady handgun law requiring local sheriffs to check backgrounds of would-be gun buyers and a statute requiring cable television operators to carry certain commercial television stations . <p> Solicitor General Walter E. Dellinger is arguing nine of the government 's cases , a higher number than usual for the government 's top lawyer at the court . <p> While this term is rich in high passion , the Rehnquist court 's distinction in recent years has been rulings on the balance of power between Congress and the states . <p> A slim but sure majority ( Rehnquist , Sandra Day O'Connor , Scalia , Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas ) has demonstrated it believes the federal government has encroached on states ' authority and is trying to reverse that trend . <p> Whether that will translate into the invalidation of the Brady law or other curtailing of congressional power will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . Of greater interest to many court watchers will be whether physicians can help terminally ill people end their lives , whether repeat sex offenders can be locked up , and when Clinton will be forced to answer Jones 's harassment charges . <p> " It 's getting awfully hard to get seats there these days , " said attorney John Roberts , a former government lawyer and Rehnquist clerk now in private practice . <p> Staff writer John Schwartz contributed to this report . <p> HIGH-PROFILE DOCKET <p> PEOPLE ARE KEEPING CLOSE WATCH ON THESE SUPREME COURT CASES <p> Washington v. Glucksburg and Vacco v. Quill <p> Whether terminally ill people have a constitutional right to hasten death with the help of a physician . <p> Clinton v. Jones <p> Whether a private lawsuit against a sitting president must be postponed until he leaves office . <p> United States v. Lanier <p> Whether a state judge who sexually assaulted several women can be convicted under federal civil rights law . <p> Kansas v. Hendricks <p> Whether a state law forcing sexual predators to be institutionalized even after they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union <p> Whether it violates freedom of speech to restrict indecent materials from being distributed over the Internet . <p> Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York <p> Whether a court order creating 15-foot no-protest zones around patients and staff approaching abortion clinic violates protesters ' free speech guarantee . <p> Mack v. United States and Printz v. United States <p> Whether the Brady handgun control law , requiring local sheriffs to run background checks on would-be gun buyers , infringes on states ' authority . <p> Abrams v. Johnson <p> Whether a district court violated voting rights law when it reduced the majority-black congressional districts in Georgia from three to one . <p> City of Boerne v. Flores <p> Whether Congress overstepped its authority when it adopted a law that makes it difficult for government to curtail religious practices that violate local statutes .
