He has it all : " creative " job , sensible wife , pretty child , starter home in Metroland , the generic name for London 's middle-class suburbia . Chris ( Christian Bale ) also has something he does n't need : his best friend from the swinging ' 60s , a wandering poet named Toni ( Lee Ross ) , who lurches back into his life in the late ' 70s to taunt and tempt him . The taunts are about the road not taken  --  abandoned career in photography , abandoned girlfriend ( sweet , sexy Elsa Zylberstein ) from his years in Paris . The temptation is to return to youthful irresponsibility . <P> Uh-oh  --  another wistful study of quiet desperation among the symbol manipulators , another examination of how the anarchic spirit of the ' 60s got sold out . But this adaptation of Julian Barnes ' first novel , by director Philip Saville and screenwriter Adrian Hodges , has some good things going for it . They understand that it is n't politics , Pop Art or drugs that would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for people like Chris . It 's the sex , stupid . And the freedom that era offered to pursue it across all sorts of formerly formidable barriers . <P> There 's honesty and energy in the film 's flashbacking pursuit of that thought . But Chris ' lasting luck is his wife Marion . Emily Watson plays her as a kind of dream nanny  --  knowing , ironic , tolerant of his erotic nostalgia and not as prim as she looks . She , and Metroland , finally make a good , subtle case for the bearable weightiness of middle-class being , for the higher morality of muddling through . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
