<p> When Mark Dupree attended an investment seminar at the Melody C Ranch in Lake City in February 1998 , he was impressed by the sumptuous surroundings at the remote southern Colorado ranch and by the high-powered business people he met there . <p> He was comforted that , interspersed with talk of offshore banking and high-yield loans , the weekend gathering had a religious tone , with prayers before every meeting and frequent references to the Bible . <p> Most of all , Dupree , a Hollywood , Fla. , computer technician , was won over by the charisma of Gerry Craft , a man he says he believed to be an ex-pro football player , a minister , and a wealthy and shrewd international businessman who spoke at the session about fabulous financial rewards - 30 percent interest on investments in 30 to 45 days . <p> Following Craft 's instructions , Dupree deposited $ 25 in pure silver coins in a bank owned by an Oklahoma Indian tribe . This was the requirement for opening an account at the First Lenape Nation Bank . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told he would begin receiving interest checks every two weeks . <p> Dupree gave Gerry Craft $ 36,000 . He says he never got a dime back . <p> Neither have many hundreds of other investors around the country who have handed over an estimated $ 17 million to Craft and his associates in the past three years . <p> Craft , who never played pro football and who obtained his ' doctorate ' from a mail-order college , is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for possible fraud . <p> The investigation traces an investment scheme that stretches from Lake City to the Turks and Caicos Islands and centers on a bank tacked onto a bingo parlor in the central Oklahoma town of Anadarko , otherwise known as ' Indian City , USA . ' <p> The FBI has seized computers and files from Craft 's offices in Oklahoma City , and the SEC has been serving Craft with subpoenas that have been ignored for nearly two years . <p> The SEC also has been unable to get much information from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is outside the law where federal banking regulations are concerned . It is the only bank in the country to operate like an offshore bank because it is in the sovereign territory of the Delaware Indian tribe and has not been registered with state and federal banking authorities . That means Lenape offers the same banking secrecy as Swiss or offshore banks . <p> Through his involvement with Lenape , Craft has led investigators into new , uncharted and difficult-to-probe territory with his investments . <p> Craft has also led individual investors into bankruptcy , foreclosures , and the loss of homes , farms and businesses , according to investors and court records . <p> ' He told us he wanted to help the little people , ' said Benny Holland of Clyde , Texas . ' He 's a silver-tongued devil , I 'll tell you . He 's devastated some little people . ' <p> Holland says he lost a home after investing $ 195,000 with Craft 18 months ago . <p> Holland and his friend Curtis Heinz heard third-hand about Craft while they were attending an international investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a way of investing through offshore banks that would be secret and quickly yield big returns . <p> Holland and Heinz flew to Oklahoma City to meet with Craft . They say he showed them his television production and photography studios and dropped hints about the 10 international businesses he owned and about his former career as a pro football player . He bragged about the big ranch he owned in Colorado . <p> Holland and Heinz wanted in . Craft sent them to the Lenape bank to deposit their silver . They said in an interview that they wondered about a bank housed in a modular trailer tacked to a bingo parlor , but were utterly convinced that Craft would do what he said - send them 30 percent interest checks every two weeks on their investments . <p> When those checks did n't arrive , Heinz and Holland began calling Craft . They started receiving the first of what would grow to a two-page list of excuses Holland has cataloged after a year and a half - the bank trader Craft was dealing with had cancer , money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holdup with their stockbroker , a plane carrying money orders was struck by lightning . <p> They say they pestered other associates of Craft who went by nicknames like Peanut and Big Al and were given the same runaround . Finally , the excuses stopped . No one at Craft &; Sons , Tel-Atlantic Fund , Wealthmart International Inc. or any of a host of other business names Craft used would return calls . <p> Jack McClung , an emu rancher and a 64-year-old native of Oklahoma City , has a different twist to his tale of money lost through Gerry Craft . <p> When McClung met Craft in an Oklahoma City restaurant two years ago , he had no money to invest : Emu ranching had been a trendy financial bust . McClung told Craft about his money woes , and Craft promised he could come up with $ 15 million for McClung 's emu business if McClung would come to work for him . <p> McClung says he is a devout Christian who liked Craft 's philosophy of helping other Christians achieve wealth . <p> McClung began recruiting investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , collecting $ 2 million to $ 3 million before he realized ' things were not as they were supposed to be ' at Craft &; Sons . <p> McClung said he was never paid the $ 1.5 million commission Craft promised him . He received no money for his emu ranch . He said he is now trying to raise money so he can pay back the people he lured into investing with Craft . <p> ' I do n't want to call him a crook because I do n't know that for sure . But I have absolutely no idea where any of that money went , ' McClung said . <p> Some who invested with Craft still believe in him . <p> ' I still think he will come through , ' said one of Craft 's Colorado investors who asked that his name not be used . ' There 's more to this than anyone will ever find out . ' <p> John Niesley , a real estate broker in Harrisburg , Pa. , said he still expects to get back the $ 10,000 he invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of concern . ' <p> Bernard and Barbara Rose of Scott City , Kan. , figure they 'll never see the $ 250,000 they invested with Craft . <p> That was 25 years ago . <p> The Roses met Craft at a church gathering in southeastern Kansas - he had been preaching at churches in the area - and he told them he was looking for investors so he could build a church school at a development near the small eastern Oklahoma town of Vian . He promised high interest on the investment . <p> The Roses say they handed over their money before they left on their honeymoon , confident that it was in good Christian hands and that the promised checks would be deposited in the bank while they were gone . <p> When they called to check their balance , they found Craft had not made any deposits . When they called Craft , he gave them a varying list of excuses . <p> ' It was always someone else 's fault . He would say his money from overseas had n't come in , ' Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses . A brother and sister-in-law from Garden City lost their farm when Craft did n't pay off on their $ 190,000 investment . An acquaintance in Oklahoma died of a heart attack when he realized his savings were gone . <p> For some time , the Roses said they all believed that Craft was a good man who had run into hard luck . <p> Later , when they began recounting Craft 's various stories , they notified the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and the FBI . The agencies investigated , but Craft was never charged . <p> ' He picked on Christian people in small towns , and he ruined a lot of people , ' Barbara Rose said . ' He needs to be stopped . ' <p> In Colorado , Craft also left his mark , although compared to the problems claimed by others who dealt with him , the 300 year-round residents of Lake City may have been lucky . As detailed in The Denver Post on Aug. 15 , Craft came to Lake City in 1997 making big promises . He contracted to purchase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area 's most scenic spread , the 120-acre Moncrief Ranch . <p> He was going to expand the rustic log lodge into a five-star resort with a gourmet restaurant and an underground parking garage . The ranch would contain an internationally famous art institute , a culinary school , TV studios , a golf course and a retreat for business titans . <p> He promised to make numerous television specials , and did produce one , of a Lake City Christmas with paid celebrities he brought to town and Lake City residents , including children , hired as extras . <p> Craft had given jobs to dozens of Lake City residents at the lodge and ranch and promised them benefits like twice-a-year cruises . But the ranch was taken back by the previous owners after Craft repeatedly extended his contract . The lodge was seized by the Colorado Department of Revenue for nonpayment of taxes and was sold to new owners two weeks ago . <p> Many of the people in Lake City say Craft left owing them money and sticking them with employment taxes he should have paid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie . <p> When they pressed Craft in Oklahoma City about the debts , he said , among other things , that in-laws he hired to run the Lake City operations had taken his money . Those in-laws deny Craft 's accusations and are now cooperating with the FBI in the investigation of Craft . <p> Officials at the First Nation Lenape Bank say they know little about Gerry Craft . Bank President Jim McMahon said Craft is not associated with the bank . <p> But Craft told investors he was on the board of directors of the bank that was created in 1997 . Craft introduced McMahon and bank CEO A.C. Yardley as business associates . <p> The SEC has evidence showing that Craft 's Tel-Atlantic Fund deposited $ 17 million in the Lenape bank from January 1997 to the present . Some of that money was then deposited in traditional banks and transferred to Craft , his associates and members of his family . <p> The bank is owned by the 1,250-member Delaware Tribe , which opened the bank with $ 5 million in capital from a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring of 1997 . <p> The bank was designed to capture some of the booming $ 3.5 trillion offshore banking market by offering the same bank secrecy . Law enforcement agencies , the IRS , the courts and the U.S. Treasury do n't have the same access to Lenape bank information or accounts as they do with traditional banks . <p> According to a ' Frequently Asked Questions ' section in the bank 's promotional material , the bank was also formed to give tribal members - nearly half of whom are unemployed - fair access to banking benefits , such as student , commercial and personal loans . <p> But a court memorandum filed by the SEC in July states that only four of the Lenape bank 's 272 customers are Indians . None of the bank 's executive officers is a member of the tribe . <p> The Delaware Tribe created a Tribal Reserve to oversee management of the bank . The SEC documents show that McMahon and Yardley are founding shareholders of that reserve . <p> Delaware Tribal Chief Larry Snake did not return phone calls . McMahon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations . Yardley was not available . <p> The bank , along with Craft , has not responded to recent SEC subpoenas and orders to show cause why subpoenas have been ignored . A federal judge ordered bank officials to appear in court Sept. 3 to explain why they are n't complying , but they did not respond or show up . <p> SEC attorney Pat Joyce said his agency has no criminal authority in the matter . He said the agency can only impose civil sanctions on Craft and the Lenape bank . <p> The SEC has already issued a warning to potential investors to stay away from banking schemes like Craft 's . The federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued alerts about Lenape to its 3,000 member banks . And the Oklahoma State Banking Commission has issued alerts warning other Oklahoma banks and the public to take ' extreme caution in any transaction involving First Lenape . ' <p> A month ago , when his activities in Lake City were going to be made public , Gerry Craft told The Denver Post he ' is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said everything would be cleared up in one month if a reporter could call him back then . <p> Craft is not returning phone calls now . Neither is his attorney . His business associates and employees refuse to comment . <p> FBI agents in Oklahoma City said they ca n't talk about the investigation . SEC attorneys also said they can not comment about Craft 's case . <p> The only people talking are Craft 's victims . <p> ' We are not sophisticated investors . We were just people praying to get ahead , ' said Mark Dupree . <p> Benny Holland said he fears Craft wo n't be held accountable because the paper trail that could bring his legal downfall ends at the Lenape bank . Authorities so far have been unable to follow it there .
