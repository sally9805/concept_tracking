<p> Just when you thought you had heard and seen enough of the American legal system in all its tainted and tattered glory  --  what with O.J. Simpson , the Menendez brothers , the Buttafuocos , the Bobbitts and Rodney King  --  along comes a book that adds more disturbing details to the debate over the long-term health of our judicial process . <p> Unlike those other televised court dramas , with their hysterical media frenzies and sensational public exposures , A Civil Action ( Random House , $ 25 ) by Jonathan Harr is a sober and exceptionally well-balanced account . It concerns a group of average citizens from Woburn , Mass. , a town northwest of Boston , who discover , in the early ' 70s , that the water they are drinking from their household taps is , essentially , killing them . <p> As one child after another in the same neighborhood is stricken with and then dies from leukemia , terrified and broken-hearted parents begin to ask some hard questions about the source of their collective affliction . The cancer trail leads up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations , where reckless toxic-waste dumping over several decades has led to a public health crisis . The story could easily pass for " The Love Canal II . " <p> A Civil Action recounts the nine embattled years it took to build the case , prepare it for trial , try it in 1986 and then appeal the jury verdict . The book tells a gripping and sad tale of the pursuit of truth , justice and the American way . <p> No less an authority than ; lawyer-author John Grisham has said of the book : " Whether in truth or fiction , I have never read a more compelling chronicle of litigation . " <p> Author Jonathan Harr was in Chicago recently ( on the day , as it turned out , that A Civil Action was nominated for a National Book Award ) to discuss his work and the unavoidable impression it leaves that all is not well in the courthouse . <p> Harr decided to follow the lawsuit while it was still in its infancy . Initially , " I did n't know how big the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential of being important , " Harr says . " At the same time , I was looking for a story that would allow me access to strong personalities . My sense is that all narratives are driven by character  --  and the closer I could get to the main characters , the better the story would be . <p> " ' L.A. Law ' had come on television around this time , and lawyers seemed ubiquitous in our society . I was curious about them , but I was not burning to do a trial story or an expose on the law . What I wanted essentially was a tabula rasa . I was waiting to see what would happen , but I had no real expectations . " <p> For Harr , a journalist who lives in Northampton , Mass. , the benefits of the natural drama that the courtroom creates was greatly accentuated by the unexpected twists and turns that the case took . All the surprises led to a compelling story with a brisk and edgy pace . <p> The unpredictability also made for relatively risky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project . <p> " From a purely narrative standpoint , I was thinking about what is the best way for this trial to end ? " he says . " If it ends in a complete collapse , then I do n't have a book . If it ends in a big victory , then I have what might be a really important book . If this case becomes a landmark , if it sets precedent , if it turns out to be the case that rings the alarm in the corporate boardrooms of America , then I would be the sole person on the inside with the incredible story . <p> " To my mind , I thought the best ending would be a clear victory for the prosecution . But I was n't bitterly disappointed at any turn ; everything seemed to me to be fascinating in its own way . " <p> As it turned out , the five-month trial ended ambiguously with no clear-cut winner . Many of the medical issues were settled out of court . Both sides could claim aspects of victory . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's the lengthy unfolding of the action that makes A Civil Action so much more revealing than anything we 've been able to watch on television . <p> If you thought that the O.J. trial peeled away the veneer of the legal process to let us see what exactly goes on in our courts , then A Civil Action comes across like a CatScan . <p> We see the enormous effort that goes on outside the courtroom to build a case . <p> We understand exactly how crucial pieces of evidence are admitted into trial or thrown out of court . <p> We watch the behind-the-scenes machinations of the lawyers and their clients as everyone struggles to reach their version of the truth . <p> We realize how drastically the personalities and backgrounds of each participant contribute to the verdict . The judge in A Civil Action , for instance , turned out to be an old chum of one of the defense attorneys . He behaved much more sympathetically to that lawyer than objective justice would dictate . <p> We also eavesdrop on jury deliberations and realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the information that is available to even the casual courtroom observer . <p> And then , of course , there is the overpowering influence of money  --  money everywhere . Staggering sums were spent in this case on expert witnesses alone . The veracity of these " hired guns " was another matter altogether . <p> The most jaded might simply snort out , " So what 's new ? " But it 's difficult to be so dismissive when one day after court , a lead defense attorney is overheard saying , " The truth ? The truth is at the bottom of a bottomless pit . " <p> Despite all this cynicism , Harr feels there is reason to take heart . <p> " I never set out to write a polemic , " he says . " People can arrive at their own conclusions , and that 's the way I prefer it . But since I finished the book , I 've had time to reflect on its wider implications . First of all , I think our legal system is probably one of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the courtroom on a contingency fee basis . There are very few systems in the world that allow for contingency fees . <p> " In England , ( the working-class families of Woburn ) would have had to pay an hourly rate to a lawyer to represent them . This means they never would have gotten into the system in the first place . <p> " Secondly , as imperfect as the system is , the principles behind the law are very admirable . It is democracy at its most basic . Your dispute is heard and judged and resolved by a jury of your peers . Nothing could be more democratic . <p> " The bad things are that economic power clearly counts . We 've seen that in many cases time and again . And the thing about the system that can not be avoided is that it is run by human beings , and they 're all fallible . Judges and lawyers alike bring all their prejudices and biases into the courtroom . I think that is why Jefferson said the price ( of democracy ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one character in the story , a Harvard Law School professor recruited by the prosecution team to act as a legal guru and guide , gives a modern spin on Jefferson 's observation . He writes : " Each trial is a drama in its own right , a morality play watched by a public audience . . . . The public has to believe that jury verdicts are statements about the truth of actual events , not mere probabilities . If that belief is ever lost , a society based on the rule of law would ultimately collapse into anarchy . " <p> George Pavlik is a Chicago free-lancer.
