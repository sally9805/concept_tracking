THE NEXT WAVE <p> THE AMERICAN diplomat Richard Holbrooke pondered a problem on the eve of the September 1996 elections in Bosnia , which were meant to restore civic life to that ravaged country . " Suppose the election was declared free and fair , " he said , and those elected are " racists , fascists , separatists , who are publicly opposed to peace and reintegration . That is the dilemma . " Indeed it is , not just in the former Yugoslavia , but increasingly around the world . Democratically elected regimes , often ones that have been reelected or reaffirmed through referenda , are routinely ignoring constitutional limits on their power and depriving their citizens of basic rights and freedoms . From Peru to the Palestinian Authority , from Sierra Leone to Slovakia , from Pakistan to the Philippines , we see the rise of a disturbing phenomenon in international life  --  illiberal democracy . <p> It has been difficult to recognize this problem because for almost a century in the West , democracy has meant liberal democracy  --  a political system marked not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule of law , a separation of powers , and the protection of basic liberties of speech , assembly , religion , and property . In fact , this latter bundle of freedoms  --  what might be termed constitutional liberalism  --  is theoretically different and historically distinct from democracy . As the political scientist Philippe Schmitter has pointed out , " Liberalism , either as a conception of political liberty , or as a doctrine about economic policy , may have coincided with the rise of democracy . But it has never been immutably or unambiguously linked to its practice . " Today the two strands of liberal democracy , interwoven in the Western political fabric , are coming apart in the rest of the world . Democracy is flourishing ; constitutional liberalism is not . <p> Today , 118 of the world 's 193 countries are democratic , encompassing a majority of its people ( 54.8 percent , to be exact ) , a vast increase from even a decade ago . In this season of victory , one might have expected Western statesmen and intellectuals to go one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheers for democracy . Instead there is a growing unease at the rapid spread of multiparty elections across south-central Europe , Asia , Africa , and Latin America , perhaps because of what happens after the elections . Popular leaders like Russia 's Boris Yeltsin and Argentina 's Carlos Menem bypass their parliaments and rule by presidential decree , eroding basic constitutional practices . The Iranian parliament  --  elected more freely than most in the Middle East  --  imposes harsh restrictions on speech , assembly , and even dress , diminishing that country 's already meager supply of liberty . Ethiopia 's elected government turns its security forces on journalists and political opponents , doing permanent damage to human rights ( as well as human beings ) . <p> Naturally there is a spectrum of illiberal democracy , ranging from modest offenders like Argentina to near-tyrannies like Kazakstan and Belarus , with countries like Romania and Bangladesh in between . Along much of the spectrum , elections are rarely as free and fair as in the West today , but they do reflect the reality of popular participation in politics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated or atypical . Freedom House 's 1996-97 survey , Freedom in the World , has separate rankings for political liberties and civil liberties , which correspond roughly with democracy and constitutional liberalism , respectively . Of the countries that lie between confirmed dictatorship and consolidated democracy , 50 percent do better on political liberties than on civil ones . In other words , half of the " democratizing " countries in the world today are illiberal democracies. ( n1 ) <p> Illiberal democracy is a growth industry . Seven years ago only 22 percent of democratizing countries could have been so categorized ; five years ago that figure had risen to 35 percent. ( n2 ) And to date few illiberal democracies have matured into liberal democracies ; if anything , they are moving toward heightened illiberalism . Far from being a temporary or transitional stage , it appears that many countries are settling into a form of government that mixes a substantial degree of democracy with a substantial degree of illiberalism . Just as nations across the world have become comfortable with many variations of capitalism , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal democracy might prove to be not the final destination on the democratic road , but just one of many possible exits . DEMOCRACY AND LIBERTY <p> FROM THE TIME of Herodotus democracy has meant , first and foremost , the rule of the people . This view of democracy as a process of selecting governments , articulated by scholars ranging from Alexis de Tocqueville to Joseph Schumpeter to Robert Dahl , is now widely used by social scientists . In The Third Wave , Samuel P. Huntington explains why : <p> Elections , open , free and fair , are the essence of democracy , the inescapable sine qua non . Governments produced by elections may be inefficient , corrupt , shortsighted , irresponsible , dominated by special interests , and incapable of adopting policies demanded by the public good . These qualities make such governments undesirable but they do not make them undemocratic . Democracy is one public virtue , not the only one , and the relation of democracy to other public virtues and vices can only be understood if democracy is clearly distinguished from the other characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commonsense view of the term . If a country holds competitive , multiparty elections , we call it democratic . When public participation in politics is increased , for example through the enfranchisement of women , it is seen as more democratic . Of course elections must be open and fair , and this requires some protections for freedom of speech and assembly . But to go beyond this minimalist definition and label a country democratic only if it guarantees a comprehensive catalog of social , political , economic , and religious rights turns the word democracy into a badge of honor rather than a descriptive category . After all , Sweden has an economic system that many argue curtails individual property rights , France until recently had a state monopoly on television , and England has an established religion . But they are all clearly and identifiably democracies . To have democracy mean , subjectively , " a good government renders it analytically useless . <p> Constitutional liberalism , on the other hand , is not about the procedures for selecting government , but rather government 's goals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that seeks to protect an individual 's autonomy and dignity against coercion , whatever the source  --  state , church , or society . The term marries two closely connected ideas . It is liberal because it draws on the philosophical strain , beginning with the Greeks , that emphasizes individual liberty. ( n3 ) It is constitutional because it rests on the tradition , beginning with the Romans , of the rule of law . Constitutional liberalism developed in Western Europe and the United States as a defense of the individual 's right to life and property , and freedom of religion and speech . To secure these rights , it emphasized checks on the power of each branch of government , equality under the law , impartial courts and tribunals , and separation of church and state . Its canonical figures include the poet John Milton , the jurist William Blackstone , statesmen such as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison , and philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , Adam Smith , Baron de Montesquieu , John Stuart Mill , and Isaiah Berlin . In almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings have certain natural ( or " inalienable " ) rights and that governments must accept a basic law , limiting its own powers , that secures them . Thus in 1215 at Runnymede , England 's barons forced the king to abide by the settled and customary law of the land . In the American colonies these laws were made explicit , and in 1638 the town of Hartford adopted the first written constitution in modern history . In the 1970s , Western nations codified standards of behavior for regimes across the globe . The Magna Carta , the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut , the American Constitution , and the Helsinki Final Act are all expressions of constitutional liberalism . THE ROAD TO LIBERAL DEMOCRACY <p> SINCE 1945 Western governments have , for the most part , embodied both democracy and constitutional liberalism . Thus it is difficult to imagine the two apart , in the form of either illiberal democracy or liberal autocracy . In fact both have existed in the past and persist in the present . Until the twentieth century , most countries in Western Europe were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ franchise was tightly restricted , and elected legislatures had little power . In 1830 Great Britain , in some ways the most democratic European nation , allowed barely 2 percent of its population to vote for one house of Parliament ; that figure rose to 7 percent after 1867 and reached around 40 percent in the 1880s . Only in the late 1940s did most Western countries become full-fledged democracies , with universal adult suffrage . But one hundred years earlier , by the late 1840s , most of them had adopted important aspects of constitutional liberalism  --  the rule of law , private property rights , and increasingly , separated powers and free speech and assembly . For much of modern history , what characterized governments in Europe and North America , and differentiated them from those around the world , was not democracy but constitutional liberalism . The " Western model " is best symbolized not by the mass plebiscite but the impartial judge . <p> The recent history of East Asia follows the Western itinerary . After brief flirtations with democracy after World War II , most East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autocracy to liberalizing autocracy , and , in some cases , toward liberalizing semi-democracy. ( n4 ) Most of the regimes in East Asia remain only semi-democratic , with patriarchs or one-party systems that make their elections ratifications of power rather than genuine contests . But these regimes have accorded their citizens a widening sphere of economic , civil , religious , and limited political rights . As in the West , liberalization in East Asia has included economic liberalization , which is crucial in promoting both growth and liberal democracy . Historically , the factors most closely associated with full-fledged liberal democracies are capitalism , a bourgeoisie , and a high per capita GNP . Today 's East Asian governments are a mix of democracy , liberalism , capitalism , oligarchy , and corruption  --  much like Western governments circa 1900 . <p> Constitutional liberalism has led to democracy , but democracy does not seem to bring constitutional liberalism . In contrast to the Western and East Asian paths , during the last two decades in Latin America , Africa , and parts of Asia , dictatorships with little background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results are not encouraging . In the western hemisphere , with elections having been held in every country except Cuba , a 1993 study by the scholar Larry Diamond determined that 10 of the 22 principal Latin American countries " have levels of human rights abuse that are incompatible with the consolidation of liberal democracy . " ( n5 ) In Africa , democratization has been extraordinarily rapid . Within six months in 1990 much of Francophone Africa lifted its ban on multiparty politics . Yet although elections have been held in most of the 45 sub-Saharan states since 1991 ( 18 in 1996 alone ) , there have been setbacks for freedom in many countries . One of Africa 's most careful observers , Michael Chege , surveyed the wave of democratization and drew the lesson that the continent had " overemphasized multiparty elections . . . and correspondingly neglected the basic tenets of liberal governance . " In Central Asia , elections , even when reasonably free , as in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakstan , have resulted in strong executives , weak legislatures and judiciaries , and few civil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestinian Authority to Iran to Pakistan , democratization has led to an increasing role for theocratic politics , eroding long-standing traditions of secularism and tolerance . In many parts of that world , such as Tunisia , Morocco , Egypt , and some of the Gulf States , were elections to be held tomorrow , the resulting regimes would almost certainly be more illiberal than the ones now in place . <p> Many of the countries of Central Europe , on the other hand , have moved successfully from communism to liberal democracy , having gone through the same phase of liberalization without democracy as other European countries did during the nineteenth century . Indeed , the Austro-Hungarian empire , to which most belonged , was a classic liberal autocracy . Even outside Europe , the political scientist Myron Weiner detected a striking connection between a constitutional past and a liberal democratic present . He pointed out that , as of 1983 , " every single country in the Third World that emerged from colonial rule since the Second World War with a population of at least one million ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous democratic experience is a former British colony . " ( n6 ) British rule meant not democracy  --  colonialism is by definition undemocratic  --  but constitutional liberalism . Britain 's legacy of law and administration has proved more beneficial than France 's policy of enfranchising some of its colonial populations . <p> While liberal autocracies may have existed in the past , can one imagine them today ? Until recently , a small but powerful example flourished off the Asian mainland  --  Hong Kong . For 156 years , until July 1 , 1997 , Hong Kong was ruled by the British Crown through an appointed governor general . Until 1991 it had never held a meaningful election , but its government epitomized constitutional liberalism , protecting its citizens ' basic rights and administering a fair court system and bureaucracy . A September 8,1997 , editorial on the island 's future in The Washington Post was ? titled ominously , " Undoing Hong Kong 's Democracy . " Actually , Hong Kong has precious little democracy to undo ; what it has is a framework of rights and laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's world , but they do help one weigh the relative value of democracy and constitutional liberalism . Consider , for example , the question of where you would rather live , Haiti , an illiberal democracy , or Antigua , a liberal semi-democracy . Your choice would probably relate not to the weather , which is pleasant in both , but to the political climate , which is not . ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNTY <p> JOHN STUART MILL opened his classic On Liberty by noting that as countries became democratic , people tended to believe that " too much importance had been attached to the limitation of power itself . That ... was a response against rulers whose interests were opposed to those of the people . " Once the people were themselves in charge , caution was unnecessary . " The nation did not need to be protected against its own will . " As if confirming Mill 's fears , consider the words of Alexandr Lukashenko after being elected president of Belarus with an overwhelming majority in a free election in 1994 , when asked about limiting his powers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , and I am going to be for the people . " <p> The tension between constitutional liberalism and democracy centers on the scope of governmental authority . Constitutional liberalism is about the limitation of power , democracy about its accumulation and use . For this reason , many eighteenth-century liberals saw in democracy a force that could undermine liberty . James Madison explained in The Federalist that " the danger of oppression " in a democracy came from " the majority of the community . " Tocqueville warned of the " tyranny of the majority , " writing , " The very essence of democratic government consists in the absolute sovereignty of the majority . " <p> The tendency for democratic government to believe it has absolute sovereignty ( that is , power ) can result in the centralization of authority , often by extraconstitutional means and with grim results . Over the last decade , elected governments claiming to represent the people have steadily encroached on the powers and rights of other elements in society , a usurpation that is both horizontal ( from other branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local authorities as well as private businesses and other nongovernmental groups ) . Lukashenko and Peru 's Alberto Fujimori are only the worst examples of this practice . ( While Fujimori 's actions  --  disbanding the legislature and suspending the constitution , among others  --  make it difficult to call his regime democratic , it is worth noting that he won two elections and was extremely popular until recently . ) Even a bonafide reformer like Carlos Menem has passed close to 300 presidential decrees in his eight years in office , about three times as many as all previous Argentinean presidents put together , going back to 1853 . Kyrgyzstan 's Askar Akayev , elected with 60 percent of the vote , proposed enhancing his powers in a referendum that passed easily in 1996 . His new powers include appointing all top officials except the prime minister , although he can dissolve parliament if it turns down three of his nominees for the latter post . <p> Horizontal usurpation , usually by presidents , is more obvious , but vertical usurpation is more common . Over the last three decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flimsy grounds , placing new regions under New Delhi 's direct rule . In a less dramatic but typical move , the elected government of the Central African Republic recently ended the long-standing independence of its university system , making it part of the central state apparatus . <p> Usurpation is particularly widespread in Latin America and the states of the former Soviet Union , perhaps because both regions mostly have presidencies . These systems tend to produce strong leaders who believe that they speak for the people  --  even when they have been elected by no more than a plurality . ( As Juan Linz points out , Salvador Allende was elected to the Chilean presidency in 1970 with only 36 percent of the vote . In similar circumstances , a prime minister would have had to share power in a coalition government . ) Presidents appoint cabinets of cronies , rather than senior party figures , maintaining few internal checks on their power . And when their views conflict with those of the legislature , or even the courts , presidents tend to " go to the nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While scholars debate the merits of presidential versus parliamentary forms of government , usurpation can occur under either , absent well-developed alternate centers of power such as strong legislatures , courts , political parties , regional governments , and independent universities and media . Latin America actually combines presidential systems with proportional representation , producing populist leaders and multiple parties-an unstable combination . <p> Many Western governments and scholars have encouraged the creation of strong and centralized states in the Third World . Leaders in these countries have argued that they need the authority to break down feudalism , split entrenched coalitions , override vested interests , and bring order to chaotic societies . But this confuses the need for a legitimate government with that for a powerful one . Governments that are seen as legitimate can usually maintain order and pursue tough policies , albeit slowly , by building coalitions . After all , few claim that governments in developing countries should not have adequate police powers ; the trouble comes from all the other political , social , and economic powers that they accumulate . In crises like civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively , but the alternative  --  states with vast security apparatuses that suspend constitutional rights  --  has usually produced neither order nor good government . More often , such states have become predatory , maintaining some order but also arresting opponents , muzzling dissent , nationalizing industries , and confiscating property . While anarchy has its dangers , the greatest threats to human liberty and happiness in this century have been caused not by disorder but by brutally strong , centralized states , like Nazi Germany , Soviet Russia , and Maoist China . The Third World is littered with the bloody handiwork of strong states . <p> Historically , unchecked centralization has been the enemy of liberal democracy . As political participation increased in Europe over the nineteenth century , it was accommodated smoothly in countries such as England and Sweden , where medieval assemblies , local governments , and regional councils had remained strong . Countries like France and Prussia , on the other hand , where the monarchy had effectively centralized power ( both horizontally and vertically ) , often ended up illiberal and undemocratic . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberalism lay in Catalonia , for centuries a doggedly independent and autonomous region . In America , the presence of a rich variety ofinstitutions  --  state , local , and private  --  made it much easier to accommodate the rapid and large extensions in suffrage that took place in the early nineteenth century . Arthur Schlesinger Sr. has documented how , during America 's first 50 years , virtually every state , interest group and faction tried to weaken and even break up the federal government. ( n7 ) More recently , India 's semi-liberal democracy has survived because of , not despite , its strong regions and varied languages , cultures , and even castes . The point is logical , even tautological : pluralism in the past helps ensure political pluralism in the present . <p> Fifty years ago , politicians in the developing world wanted extraordinary powers to implement then-fashionable economic doctrines , like nationalization of industries . Today their successors want similar powers to privatize those very industries . Menem 's justification for his methods is that they are desperately needed to enact tough economic reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by Fujimori . Lending institutions , such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , have been sympathetic to these pleas , and the bond market has been positively exuberant . But except in emergencies like war , illiberal means are in the long run incompatible with liberal ends . Constitutional government is in fact the key to a successful economic reform policy . The experience of East Asia and Central Europe suggests that when regimes  --  whether authoritarian , as in East Asia , or liberal democratic , as in Poland , Hungary , and the Czech Republic  --  protect individual rights , including those of property and contract , and create a framework of law and administration , capitalism and growth will follow . In a recent speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington , explaining what it takes for capitalism to flourish , Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan concluded that , " The guiding mechanism of a free market economy . . . is a bill of rights , enforced by an impartial judiciary " <p> Finally , and perhaps more important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ill . When Fujimori disbanded parliament , his approval ratings shot up to their highest ever . But recent opinion polls suggest that most of those who once approved of his actions now wish he were more constrained . In 1993 Boris Yeltsin famously ( and literally ) attacked the Russian parliament , prompted by parliament 's own unconstitutional acts . He then suspended the constitutional court , dismantled the system of local governments , and fired several provincial governors . From the war in Chechnya to his economic programs , Yeltsin has displayed a routine lack of concern for constitutional procedures and limits . He may well be a liberal democrat at heart , but Yeltsin 's actions have created a Russian super-presidency . We can only hope his successor will not abuse it . <p> For centuries Western intellectuals have had a tendency to view constitutional liberalism as a quaint exercise in rule-making , mere formalism that should take a back seat to battling larger evils in society . The most eloquent counterpoint to this view remains an exchange in Robert Bolt 's play A Man For All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to battle evil , is exasperated by Sir Thomas More 's devotion to the law . More gently defends himself . <p> MORE : What would you do ? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil ? <p> ROPER : I 'd cut every law in England to do that ! <p> MORE : And when the last law was down , and the Devil turned on you  --  where would you hide Roper , the laws all being flat ? ETHNIC CONFLICT AND WAR <p> ON DECEMBER 8,1996 , Jack Lang made a dramatic dash to Belgrade . The French celebrity politician , formerly minister of culture , had been inspired by the student demonstrations involving tens of thousands against Slobodan Milosevic , a man Lang and many Western intellectuals held responsible for the war in the Balkans . Lang wanted to lend his moral support to the Yugoslav opposition . The leaders of the movement received him in their offices  --  the philosophy department  --  only to boot him out , declare him " an enemy of the Serbs , " and order him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students opposed Milosevic not for starting the war , but for failing to win it . <p> Lang 's embarrassment highlights two common , and often mistaken , assumptions  --  that the forces of democracy are the forces of ethnic harmony and of peace . Neither is necessarily true . Mature liberal democracies can usually accommodate ethnic divisions without violence or terror and live in peace with other liberal democracies . But without a background in constitutional liberalism , the introduction of democracy in divided societies has actually fomented nationalism , ethnic conflict , and even war . The spate of elections held immediately after the collapse of communism were won in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia by nationalist separatists and resulted in the breakup of those countries . This was not in and of itself bad , since those countries had been bound together by force . But the rapid secessions , without guarantees , institutions , or political power for the many minorities living within the new countries , have caused spirals of rebellion , repression , and , in places like Bosnia , Azerbaijan , and Georgia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' votes . In societies without strong traditions of multiethnic groups or assimilation , it is easiest to organize support along racial , ethnic , or religious lines . Once an ethnic group is in power , it tends to exclude other ethnic groups . Compromise seems impossible ; one can bargain on material issues like housing , hospitals , and handouts , but how does one split the difference on a national religion ? Political competition that is so divisive can rapidly degenerate into violence . Opposition movements , armed rebellions , and coups in Africa have often been directed against ethnically based regimes , many of which came to power through elections . Surveying the breakdown of African and Asian democracies in the 1960s , two scholars concluded that democracy " is simply not viable in an environment of intense ethnic preferences . " Recent studies , particularly of Africa and Central Asia , have confirmed this pessimism . A distinguished expert on ethnic conflict , Donald Horowitz , concluded , " In the face of this rather dismal account . . . Of the concrete failures of democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw up one 's hands . What is the point of holding elections if all they do in the end is to substitute a Bemba-dominated regime for a Nyanja regime in Zambia , the two equally narrow , or a southern regime for a northern one in Benin , neither incorporating the other half of the state ? " ( n8 ) <p> Over the past decade , one of the most spirited debates among scholars of international relations concerns the " democratic peace "  --  the assertion that no two modern democracies have gone to war with each other . The debate raises interesting substantive questions ( does the American Civil War count ? do nuclear weapons better explain the peace ? ) and even the statistical findings have raised interesting dissents . ( As the scholar David Spiro points out , given the small number of both democracies and wars over the last two hundred years , sheer chance might explain the absence of war between democracies . No member of his family has ever won the lottery , yet few offer explanations for this impressive correlation . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? Kant , the original proponent of the democratic peace , contended that in democracies , those who pay for wars  --  that is , the public  --  make the decisions , so they are understandably cautious . But that claim suggests that democracies are more pacific than other states . Actually they are more warlike , going to war more often and with greater intensity than most states . It is only with other democracies that the peace holds . <p> When divining the cause behind this correlation , one thing becomes clear : the democratic peace is actually the liberal peace . Writing in the eighteenth century , Kant believed that democracies were tyrannical , and he specifically excluded them from his conception of " republican " governments , which lived in a zone of peace . Republicanism , for Kant , meant a separation of powers , checks and balances , the rule of law , protection of individual rights , and some level of representation in government ( though nothing close to universal suffrage ) . Kant 's other explanations for the " perpetual peace " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal character : a mutual respect for the rights of each other 's citizens , a system of checks and balances assuring that no single leader can drag his country into war , and classical liberal economic policies  --  most importantly , free trade  --  which create an interdependence that makes war costly and cooperation useful . Michael Doyle , the leading scholar on the subject , confirms in his 1997 book Ways of War and Peace that without constitutional liberalism , democracy itself has no peace-inducing qualities : <p> Kant distrusted unfettered , democratic majoritarianism , and his argument offers no support for a claim that all participatory polities  --  democracies  --  should be peaceful , either in general or between fellow democracies . Many participatory polities have been non-liberal . For two thousand years before the modern age , popular rule was widely associated with aggressiveness ( by Thucydides ) or imperial success ( by Machiavelli ) . . . The decisive preference of the median voter might well include " ethnic cleansing " against other democratic polities . <p> The distinction between liberal and illiberal democracies sheds light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Edward Mansfield contend , using an impressive data set , that over the last 200 years democratizing states went to war significantly more often than either stable autocracies or liberal democracies . In countries not grounded in constitutional liberalism , the rise of democracy often brings with it hyper-nationalism and war-mongering . When the political system is opened up , diverse groups with incompatible interests gain access to power and press their demands . Political and military leaders , who are often embattled remnants of the old authoritarian order , realize that to succeed that they must rally the masses behind a national cause . The result is invariably aggressive rhetoric and policies , which often drag countries into confrontation and war . Noteworthy examples range from Napoleon III 's France , Wilhelmine Germany , end Taisho Japan to those in today 's newspapers , like Armenia and Azerbaijan and Milosevic 's Serbia . The democratic peace , it turns out , has little to do with democracy . THE AMERICAN PATH <p> AN AMERICAN SCHOLAR recently traveled to Kazakstan on a U.S. government-sponsored mission to help the new parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Kazak parliament , brushed aside the many options the American expert was outlining , saying emphatically , " We want our parliament to be just like your Congress . " The American was horrified , recalling , " I tried to say something other than the three words that had immediately come screaming into my mind : ' No you do n't ! ' " This view is not unusual . Americans in the democracy business tend to see their own system as an unwieldy contraption that no other country should put up with . In fact , the adoption of some aspects of the American constitutional framework could ameliorate many of the problems associated with illiberal democracy . The philosophy behind the U.S. Constitution , a fear of accumulated power , is as relevant today as it was in1789 . Kazakstan , as it happens , would be particularly well-served by a strong parliament  --  like the American Congress  --  to check the insatiable appetite of its president . <p> It is odd that the United States is so often the advocate of elections and plebiscitary democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not how democratic it is but rather how undemocratic it is , placing as it does multiple constraints on electoral majorities . Of its three branches of government , one  --  arguably paramount  --  is headed by nine unelected men and women with life tenure . Its Senate is the most unrepresentative upper house in the world , with the lone exception of the House of Lords , which is powerless . ( Every state sends two senators to Washington regardless of its population  --  California 's 30 million people have as many votes in the Senate as Arizona 's 3.7 million  --  which means that senators representing about 16 percent of the country can block any proposed law . ) Similarly , in legislatures all over the United States , what is striking is not the power of majorities but that of minorities . To further check national power , state and local governments are strong and fiercely baffle every federal intrusion onto their turf . Private businesses and other nongovernmental groups , what Tocqueville called intermediate associations , make up another stratum within society . <p> The American system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assuming that people can not be trusted with power . " If men were angels , " Madison famously wrote , " no government would be necessary . " The other model for democratic governance in Western history is based on the French Revolution . The French model places its faith in the goodness of human beings . Once the people are the source of power , it should be unlimited so that they can create a just society . ( The French revolution , as Lord Acton observed , is not about the limitation of sovereign power but the abrogation of all intermediate powers that get in its way . ) Most non-Western countries have embraced the French model  --  not least because political elites like the prospect of empowering the state , since that means empowering themselves  --  and most have descended into bouts of chaos , tyranny , or both . This should have come as no surprise . After all , since its revolution France itself has run through two monarchies , two empires , one proto-fascist dictatorship , and five republics. ( n9 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different frameworks of government . This is not a plea for the wholesale adoption of the American way but rather for a more variegated conception of liberal democracy , one that emphasizes both parts of that phrase . Before new policies can be adopted , there lies an intellectual task of recovering the constitutional liberal tradition , central to the Western experience and to the development of good government throughout the world . Political progress in Western history has been the result of a growing recognition over the centuries that , as the Declaration of Independence puts it , human beings have " certain inalienable rights " and that " it is to secure these rights that governments are instituted . " If a democracy does not preserve liberty and law , that it is a democracy is a small consolation . LIBERALIZING FOREIGN POLICY <p> A PROPER appreciation of constitutional liberalism has a variety of implications for American foreign policy . First , it suggests a certain humility . While it is easy to impose elections on a country , it is more difficult to push constitutional liberalism on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradual and long-term , in which an election is only one step . Without appropriate preparation , it might even be a false step . Recognizing this , governments and nongovernmental organizations are increasingly promoting a wide array of measures designed to bolster constitutional liberalism in developing countries . The National Endowment for Democracy promotes free markets , independent labor movements , and political parties . The U.S. Agency for International Development funds independent judiciaries . In the end , however , elections trump everything . If a country holds elections , Washington and the world will tolerate a great deal from the resulting government , as they have with Yeltsin , Akayev , and Menem . In an age of images and symbols , elections are easy to capture on film . ( How do you televise the rule of law ? ) But there is life after elections , especially for the people who live there . <p> Conversely , the absence of free and fair elections should be viewed as one flaw , not the definition of tyranny . Elections are an important virtue of governance , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judged by yardsticks related to constitutional liberalism as well . Economic , civil , and religious liberties are at the core of human autonomy and dignity . If a government with limited democracy steadily expands these freedoms , it should not be branded a dictatorship . Despite the limited political choice they offer , countries like Singapore , Malaysia , and Thailand provide a better environment for the life , liberty , and happiness of their citizens than do either dictatorships like Iraq and Libya or illiberal democracies like Slovakia or Ghana . And the pressures of global capitalism can push the process of liberalization forward . Markets and morals can work together . Even China , which remains a deeply repressive regime , has given its citizens more autonomy and economic liberty than they have had in generations . Much more needs to change before China can even be called a liberalizing autocracy , but that should not mask the fact that much has changed . <p> Finally , we need to revive constitutionalism . One effect of the overemphasis on pure democracy is that little effort is given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was understood by its greatest eighteenth century exponents , such as Montesquieu and Madison , is a complicated system of checks and balances designed to prevent the accumulation of power and the abuse of office . This is done not by simply writing up a list of rights but by constructing a system in which government will not violate those rights . Various groups must be included and empowered because , as Madison explained , " ambition must be made to counteract ambition . " Constitutions were also meant to tame the passions of the public , creating not simply democratic but also deliberative government . Unfortunately , the rich variety of unelected bodies , indirect voting , federal arrangements , and checks and balances that characterized so many of the formal and informal constitutions of Europe are now regarded with suspicion . What could be called the Weimar syndrome  --  named after interwar Germany 's beautifully constructed constitution , which failed to avert fascism  --  has made people regard constitutions as simply paperwork that can not make much difference . ( As if any political system in Germany would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Depression , and hyperinflation . ) Procedures that inhibit direct democracy are seen as inauthentic , muzzling the voice of the people . Today around the world we see variations on the same majoritarian theme . But the trouble with these winner-take-all systems is that , in most democratizing countries , the winner really does take all . DEMOCRACY 'S DISCONTENTS <p> WE LIVE IN a democratic age . Through much of human history the danger to an individual 's life , liberty and happiness came from the absolutism of monarchies , the dogma of churches , the terror of dictatorships , and the iron grip of totalitarianism . Dictators and a few straggling totalitarian regimes still persist , but increasingly they are anachronisms in a world of global markets , information , and media . There are no longer respectable alternatives to democracy ; it is part of the fashionable attire of modernity . Thus the problems of governance in the 21st century will likely be problems within democracy . This makes them more difficult to handle , wrapped as they are in the mantle of legitimacy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that they are reasonably democratic . Conversely , the greatest danger that illiberal democracy poses  --  other than to its own people  --  is that it will discredit liberal democracy itself , casting a shadow on democratic governance . This would not be unprecedented . Every wave of democracy has been followed by setbacks in which the system was seen as inadequate and new alternatives were sought by ambitious leaders and restless masses . The last such period of disenchantment , in Europe during the interwar years , was seized upon by demagogues , many of whom were initially popular and even elected . Today , in the face of a spreading virus of illiberalism , the most useful role that the international community , and most importantly the United States , can play is  --  instead of searching for new lands to democratize and new places to hold elections  --  to consolidate democracy where it has taken root and to encourage the gradual development of constitutional liberalism across the globe . Democracy without constitutional liberalism is not simply inadequate , but dangerous , bringing with it the erosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even war . Eighty years ago , Woodrow Wilson took America into the twentieth century with a challenge , to make the world safe for democracy . As we approach the next century , our task is to make democracy safe for the world . <p>
