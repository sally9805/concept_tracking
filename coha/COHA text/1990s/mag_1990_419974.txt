<p> To people who enjoy spending time in wilderness , " car camping " is an oxymoron . Camping means getting away from civilization , and to get away from civilization , you 've got to get away from its movable storage bin , the automobile . One look at Yosemite Valley 's car-choked campgrounds in midsummer and you may be convinced that the only true camping experience can be had deep in Alaska 's Brooks Range , where your only competition for a choice campsite is a flock of Dall sheep . <p> But there are plenty of good reasons for seeking out wilds within strolling distance of your hood ornament : You 're traveling with friends who do n't want to take up backpacking . Your kids have attention spans as short as their legs . Or ( pride be damned ) you just do n't want to work too hard . With a few days off , all you care about is getting away  --  to think , read , take walks in beautiful surroundings ... anything but slog your way up and down mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought enough to eat . <p> The obvious problem is that the contraption that gets you to that special somewhere can get other folks there just as easily ( More than 280 million people visited national parks in 1988 . ) To kind peace near pavement , you 've got to do a little legwork , figuratively speaking . <p> Check out campgrounds on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands , which arc usually far less congested than national parks and other high-profiec destinations . " Primitive " campgrounds ( those without such amenities as running water but often with picnic tables and pit toilets ) , campgrounds , and unpaved roads tend to discourage campers who demand all the comforts of home . <p> Recreation maps ( publicly or privately produced ) and guidebooks will help you hone down your choices , but they rarely help you sort out such qualitative factors as remoteness and peacefulness . Go straight to the source : Most land-use agencies have recreation officers whose job is to know whet 's available on their turf . <p> Even after careful sifting , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Today 's idyllic campsite may be buzzing with idling engines tomorrow . Despite that admonition , car camping , as the following pages show , can provide a refreshing respite from urban woes . Abrams Creek Tennessee <p> One of my family 's all-time favorite photos depicts my mother-in-law leaping from one rock to another amid the rushing waters of Abrams Creek in Great Smoky Mountains National Park . The shot captures her at the top of her arc , and no bluejean-clad ballerina could appear more elegant . A click of the projector brings up her husband standing in the stream , pant legs rolled up , with the sheepish look of a five-year-old caught playing in the water . <p> These two images symbolize to me the lure of my favorite easy-to-reach campsite in the Smokies . At Abrams Creek Campground I can admire the grace and beauty of the largest wilderness area in the East and have plain old fun as well . Located in the western end of the park , the campground has only 16 sites , each with a picnic table , and restrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park where " getting away from it all " usually becomes " getting away from them all . " <p> Most of the visitors to the Smokies  --  and this includes backpackers as well as conspicuous consumers  --  head for the heights , the former seeking the perfect backwoods vista and the rest settling for another roadside attraction . Abrams Creek Campground , by contrast , has no " must see " feature ; those who come here find nature on a more approachable level . <p> Although Abrams Creek is one of the larger streams in the park , being up the proverbial creek without a paddle is the only way to go here . Walking upstream from the campground , the visitor enters a cathedral-like glen of towering hemlock and pine trees . Even on the most scorching summer days , cool air flows down the valley , and the air is scented by needles live and underfoot with a smell that inspires deep , head-clearing breaths . <p> A few hundred yards upstream lie dense patches of rhododendron that hide the forest 's skittering multitudes . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious rustlings in the impenetrable bushes , only to see a red squirrel scamper across the trail . Others experience the heart-stopping thrill of a ruffed grouse exploding into flight right in front of them . <p> Although you can hike to the tops of nearby ridges and smaller mountains . I Prefer to expend my energy , or dissipate that of my kids , by continuing up the creek . Twenty-foot-high Abrams Falls is approximately five miles upstream , but along Abrams Creek I do n't need a specific destination . Depending on the weather , one of my greatest pleasures is to settle myself into a properly fitting boulder in the middle of the creek and listen to the water . Thoroughly refreshed , I saunter back down through the rhododendron and into the conifer cathedral that forms a gateway to the campground . <p> In fact , no matter where you go in the park from the Abrams Creek Campground , one of the delights of every return to home base is that the hike is all downhill . Eureka Dunes California <p> Looking for some wilderness-flavored R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bagging some peaks in your bare feet stalking rare flora and fauna just a few steps from your campsite , and exploring rugged wilderness canyons ? Or maybe you 'd prefer just stretching out on some warm , soft sand . If so , pack up a camera and binoculars , sunblock , an Indiana Jones hat , a good spare tire , and lots of extra water ; then ( if it is n't midsummer ) head for the Eureka Dunes , one of my favorite far-out answers to a car camper 's prayer . <p> Arranged tastefully between the Saline and Last Chance ranges near the top of California 's Great Basin Desert , the Eureka Valley and its dunes are just a few miles off the road leading to Death Valley National Monument 's northernmost attractions , Ubehebe Crater and Scotty 's Castle . At almost 50 miles from the nearest town ( Big Pine ) , no one can truthfully accuse these spectacular 700 foot sand mountains of being fraught with the usual urban annoyances . Access via 20 miles of gravel road is another plus for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you and any lucky kids who happen to be along can indulge yourselves in sand-between-the-toes adventures of the gleeful kind . In fact , until you 've scrambled up , slid down , and sat atop the Eureka Dunes at sunrise and sunset , you 've probably not experienced the best the California Desert has to offer by way of sensational thrills and views . The dunes , by the way , top out at 3,564 feet  --  and there are plenty of false summits . <p> Even if you 're not a scrambler and slider , the dunes bestow plenty of other favors . In the early morning and late afternoon , get out your camera or sketchbook and try capturing the pale , rhythmic forms against the richly colored Last Chance Range . Soon after dawn , put your dignity aside and creep about the sandy hummocks at the foot of the dunes looking for signs of the previous night 's wildlife dramas . Examine closely the tiny footprints of mammals and reptiles . Notice the abstract and repetitive patterns made by night-hunting insects . Search for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look around for some of the several dozen dune plants that thrive on the moisture percolating through the dunes even in the driest years . Several , like the white-flowered Eureka primrose , are found no place else in the world . <p> Hikers will probably want to explore some of the canyons in the nearby Last Chance Mountains . Although there are no trails to speak of , the beacon of the dunes makes it hard to get lost , and the colorful canyons are well-sprinkled with dry falls and cliffs . Watch out for places that are easy to get up but not down . Discretion is definitely called for when you 're so far from civilization . <p> As for camping spots , try the acres of hard clay to the north of the dunes . Just before the main road goes on to dead-end at the dunes ' northwest " corner , " bear left at a " Y " onto a narrow dirt road . At some times of the year there are chemical toilets near the dead end , but do n't count on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When the weather 's on the hot side , try camping at the northern end of Joshua Flats , about 23 miles east of Big Pine and only 17 miles from the dunes . Look for clumps of pinon and a nearly invisible dirt track on the north side of the road . You are now at 6,000 feet ; when the valley below gets too hot , this shady , undeveloped camping area is a welcome oasis . Red Desert Wyoming <p> Car camping has not been a high priority for me since the summer just after high school , when I traveled cross-country with friend in a red roads the Chevrolet van . I still remember the smells of that trip : not the honeysuckle along Highway 61 or the evergreens of Yellowstone , but the odors of two months of continuous vehicle habitation . <p> Despite these memories , the brougham bivouac is back in vogue in my household . One reason is a new van , still as fragrant as a car dealer 's aftershave . The other reasons are ages nine , eight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not far from where we live , that is both wild and reasonably well suited to car camping : the Red Desert . <p> Just south of Wyoming 's Wind River Range , sharp , snowy peaks drop away to high plains . This is where emigrants on the Oregon Trail found their way through the wall of the Rockies 150 years ago . The Red Desert is part of the Great Divide Basin , where the Continental Divide splits and encircles a shallow , arid bowl from which water can not escape to either the Pacific or Atlantic Ocean . In this sump you find a delicious variety of environments and features : volcanic spires and mountains clad in limber pine , harsh winds and sudden weather , shales of subtle colors , and the giant footprints of traveling sand dunes . <p> To the westward-bound wagons of the 1840s , it seemed the most perilous sort of country , with its driving snow or parching heat . And it still turns an inhospitable face to many who drive by it on a lonely stretch of highway north of Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uncrowded place for those with the time to take a closer look . <p> Turning off Highway 28 into the desert Just south of the Sweetwater River , we chose on a recent family outing to head for the Honeycomb Buttes , which run about 20 miles northwest-southeast across the desert . You can reach the Honeycombs on a ridge road that rounds Continental Peak , or by a less reliable choice of jeep roads that follow along the front of the badlands . <p> The varied topography of the Red Desert creates ecological islands , each with its own particular beauty . There are stands of aspen on the flanks of hard sandstone buttes , and bright blooms that spring from the pale landscape  --  lupine , scarlet gilia , desert primrose . The fauna is varied too : elk on the mountains , antelope by the springs , fer hawks diving off the steep east side of Steamboat Mountain . Certain biotic wonders in the region are so rare that locals are secretive about them  --  as I will be . <p> Hiking along the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chunk of sandstone and break it open in front of my children . Sometimes the heart of a rock holds fish fossils from the bottom of a lake that dried up eons ago . We hear a sound like someone beating a rug , and a moment later three wild horses emerge from their shelter in the badlands and race off . Little hands scuff the ground in search of arrowheads , and there are shouts of discovery  --  I 'm not so certain , but , sure , that could be a chip .... <p> You wo n't hold a four-year-old 's interest for long by pointing out 50-million-year-old shales , sniffing vetch for selenium , or describing shiny oolites found amidst the gravel . We retreat to the car , set up tents , pull out the cumbersome Coleman stove , and put on a cassette tape . Sorry , kids , no Bon Jovi tonight : As the light falls , we hear the words of Francis Parkman describing a journey along the Oregon Trail . The four-year-old plays hide-and-seek among the craggy fingers of the Honeycombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the tent to see grazing antelope on the plains below us , and a hatful of stars above . The new van is just another dark shape down the hill . Perhaps in a four-year-old 's mind it is a wagon , and perhaps it dreams , too , its own vanny dreams about mud and broken axles . Baxter State Park Maine <p> Every car that enters Baxter State Park in Maine becomes a time machine . This 200,000-acre wilderness park is a step backward from freeways , stereos , and televisions . When you come here you leave the world of the 1990s behind . <p> Instead you are greeted by the far northern reaches of the Maine woods . Rising from the forests and lakes is the 5,267-foot granite monolith of Mt . Katahdin . More than 300 miles from Boston , Baxter is a long way from anywhere big , but that 's not too far when you figure that you 're going back at least 30 years . <p> As you cross the park 's boundary , the road turns to dirt . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear dueling radios or televisions , because they 're banned . Instead , as the dark creeps in , you 'll feel a relaxing solitude enveloping you , making you a part of these deep , quiet forests . <p> There are lots of things that stand out when I think of Baxter . Close to our campsite at Roaring Brook Campground is a pond where you can go to watch the moose feed  --  guaranteed . Once , a moose and her calf strolled not five feet from my hiding place off the trail . <p> I 've never fished in Baxter , but there are hundreds of streams and lakes that I could have dropped a line into . Usually I just watch the water rush by or lap against the shore . One hundred and fifty miles of trail crisscross the park , including the Appalachian Trail , which begins on the summit of Baxter Peak . <p> I came here with my father to hike the trail one summer . Starting at Roaring Brook , we hiked for hours , first through pine forest , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day was over cast , and a stiff wind blew large drops of rain into our faces . We reached the Knife Edge , a mile-long , narrow ridge that falls away more than a thousand feet on each side . The wind picked up , so we inched along the serrated ridge  --  just five feet wide in some places  --  on all fours . Midway , the blue blazes that we were following disappeared down an almost vertical wall . For a moment the mist cleared to reveal a chasm 40 feet wide and 20 feet deep . We inched across it , blue blazes leading the way . <p> My most striking memory of Baxter State Park , though , is of Chimney Pond . From the shore of the pond I stood looking into a low cloud . I knew Mt . Katahdin hovered over the pond , but I could n't see much above 100 feet . Once again the mist cleared , and in place of sky were massive granite walls rising to the summit . The sight nearly took my breath away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It happens a lot around here . Sawmill Campground California <p> The best way to go car camping is to leave your car behind . Not way behind , of course , but bless the heart of whoever came up with the idea of walk-in campgrounds . These are campsites within a quarter-mile or so of roads and reachable only by foot . <p> That short distance is an astoundingly effective buffer that separates man from machine and offers the kind of serenity you 'd normally find only in the backcountry . You can sit around your campfire at night without that deer-in-the-headlights feeling as a late arrival slowly circles the campground looking for the best ( or any ) place to park , and you can sleep well knowing that you wo n't be awakened by early-morning anglers warming up their rigs before heading off . <p> The quarter-mile walk might as well be the Great Wall to campers who expect their personal Conestoga to be right there , aimed head-out for a quick getaway . To reach a walk-in , you 've got to leave behind the bulkiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bug zappers and two-burner stoves ) , and tote your gear to the site on your back or in your arms . <p> To backpackers , the short walk provides a refreshing opportunity to break all the parsimonious rules of their sport . Instead of paring your food and gear , Colin Fletcher-like , to the bare essentials , you can indulge yourself a little . Like Triscuits ? Take the whole box ! Here , have a few bottles of beer ! Tired of sleeping on thin Ensolite ? Grab that bulky foam pad and prepare for an afternoon snooze . You can return for what you 've forgotten , and schlepp back what you have n't used . All of which sounds silly to a committed car camper , but it 's wonderfully decadent to a backpacker used to meting out each day 's allotment of Ak-Mak crackers like communion wafers . <p> A case in point : In summer , parts of Yosemite National Park resemble a parking lot . Yet 20 minutes east of Tuolumne Meadows Campground 's " Sorry , Campground Full ( of Lumbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car-free mecca just outside the park at about 10,000 feet in elevation . Wilderness wannabes leave their cars at a locked Forest Service gate along Saddlebag Lake Road and walk ( or saunter or skip ) to the campground 's seven sites overlooking Lee Vining Creek . <p> The reward for this minimal effort is an uninterrupted view of the precipitous eastern slope of the Sierra . The snow-filled cirques and granite peaks that face the campground are destinations along the Sierra High Route , an arduous , unmarked hiking track that traverses 195 miles of rugged timberline country . From Sawmill up to the escarpment , lush meadows sprinkled with pocket lakes are a dayhiker 's delight  --  surprisingly gentle and all part of the 3,883-square-mile Hall Natural Area , where camping is prohibited . Looking back from the jumbled blocks of granite at the base of some of the Sierra 's highest ridges , you take in the rounded , red-slate mountains on the dry , eastern side .
