I have spent the past few days flipping back and forth mentally between the Clinton-Lewinsky business and a new book by the New Yorker 's Philip Gourevitch titled We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families : Stories from Rwanda . <P> The disproportion between the two subjects is grotesque , almost a joke . To crowd Lewinsky and Rwanda into the same viewfinder is not just to discuss apples and oranges but to compare , forgive me , apples and severed heads . Each of the dramas discloses a nation in moral crisis , but as Bill Clinton might point out , it depends what you mean by " moral . " What a difference in the nations  --  and in the crises . <P> A surreal juxtaposition  --  an interesting surprise , like a rattlesnake in the mailbox  --  may disturb and clarify the mind . When you put the Clinton scandal and the Rwandan genocide side by side , each becomes a slightly different thing . <P> First , perspective : the moral weight of a national crisis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . America in its opulence gets presidential docu-porn  --  what the Washington lawyer Lloyd Cutler calls " Full Monty impeachment , " the risky , tiresome romp of a resourceful President who , caught in violations of the school 's honor code , violates it further in protesting his innocence . <P> By contrast , Rwanda ( average monthly income : less than $25 ) gets rivers clogged with corpses . America 's wealth entitles its citizens to work themselves into a moral froth over office fellatio . America 's vast First World privilege also means that its scandals are infinitely less dangerous to the man and woman in the street . America 's samurai of opinion scream at one another on talk shows ; political argument in Rwanda means a million people hacked to pieces by machetes . <P> I thought of the reporting devoted to the two subjects : Gourevitch 's book ranks among the best examples of the journalism of moral witness . It speaks with an austerity enforced by the mystery and horror of the genocide . <P> True evil vs. pathetic misbehavior : the Lewinsky coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messy chitterlings from the abattoirs of Starr , Tripp &; Drudge get mass-packaged in clingwrap and cardboard for the gaudy supermarkets of the information age . <P> But you do notice one damning convergence . In 1994 , the United States , having been burned in Somalia , was desperate to stay out of Rwanda . How to manage that ? By pettifogging . By arguing about semantics : the Clinton way . His Administration , pressed to honor the 1948 Genocide Convention ( not to mention human decency ) by intervening , quibbled at a furious rate about the meaning of the word genocide . Madeleine Albright , who was Clinton 's ambassador to the U.N . in 1994 , temporized as the death toll in Rwanda climbed into the hundreds of thousands . It was , as Gourevitch writes , " the absolute low point of her career as a stateswoman . " What works first for tragedy will serve later for farce . The casuistry pressed into service to dodge an inconvenient genocide made a later , lighter appearance in Clinton 's Jesuitical parsing , under oath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
