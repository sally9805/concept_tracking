Section : STOCK MUTUAL FUNDS/REPORT How to spot funds that are likely to shine over the long term <p> Which stock market were your investments in last year ? The one commonly measured by the Standard &; Poor 's 500 Index ( the S &P; 500 ) grabbed all the headlines . It climbed nearly 27 percent - brushing off Asia 's economic woes , Russian debt default , a giant hedge-fund collapse , presidential impeachment talk , and all manner of global political strife - to cap yet another exceptionally strong year . But perhaps you were among the less fortunate investors who own one or more of the 371 U.S. equity funds that ended the year with just single-digit gains . Or could it be that you even had holdings in some of the 668 stock funds that actually lost money in 1998 ? <p> Whether your fund investments prospered or languished , there was no escaping the market 's nail-biting drama . After rising smartly through mid-July , the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled nearly 20 percent during the summer , only to revive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-time high . Buckle up <p> All of the elements that made the past year so unsettling are still in place this year , and new worries loom on the horizon . The once-vibrant emerging economies of Asia and Latin America remain troubled . Corporate earnings growth in the U.S. is ebbing . Yet stock prices have been bid up to frothy levels , fed in large part by a lemming-like rush to purchase shares in over-hyped Internet stocks or to try to cash in on the next corporate megamerger , of which there were a record number in 1998 . And it 's anyone 's guess what effect Europe 's new single currency , the euro , will have on stock prices in the U.S. or how much havoc the Year 2000 computer-software problem will wreak on markets and economies around the world . <p> What does all this near-term uncertainty mean for ordinary folks hoping to finance a child 's education or their own retirement ? If you 're in the stock market for the long haul - preferably for ten years or longer - you can be reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience will be rewarded with returns superior to those you can earn from just about any other investment . <p> Still , the chore of deciding which funds merit your trust in a seesawing stock market can be daunting . There are 2,820 domestic and international equity funds competing for a piece of your investment budget . Of these , only about one-fifth have been around long enough to have experienced the last major market correction in 1987 ; some 150 new funds were launched in the past year alone . <p> This report , our annual review of equity mutual funds , sets out to help you uncover funds that have a proven record of solid long-term performance and efficient operations . Produced with the help of data provided by Morningstar , the Chicago-based mutual-fund research firm , the tables below list the 100 funds that made the cut . In " Tips for managing your equity funds " , we offer pointers on how best to manage your fund holdings . We also compare how the dozen stock funds most commonly offered as investment options through 401(k) retirement savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stock Funds . " Sifting for quality <p> The listed funds are organized according to the size of the 5,000 actively traded U.S. companies in which they focus their investments . Large-cap funds concentrate their holdings on the 250 largest corporations , whose 1998 market value exceeded $8.3 billion . Midcap funds choose from among the next 750 biggest companies , whose market capitalization ranged from $1.2 billion to $8.3 billion . And small-cap funds look for opportunities among the remaining 4,000 firms , each valued at less than $1.2 billion . <p> These broad groupings are further subdivided according to the style fund managers follow in selecting investments to add to a fund 's portfolio . Growth fund managers look for stocks in companies that enjoy rapidly rising sales and earnings . Managers of value funds , by contrast , try to spot companies they believe to be undervalued by the stock market but with good prospects for appreciation . Blend funds tend to own portfolios of stocks having both growth and value characteristics . <p> In addition to these nine domestic fund categories , the listings include a selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall investment recipe is a good way to diversify your portfolio , since financial markets of other nations tend not to move in lockstep with U.S. markets . With stability in mind , our international fund choices invest broadly in the shares of companies based in many countries and do not specialize in any single nation or region . <p> For investors who prefer to put their money behind companies that do n't harm workers ' and consumers ' health or the environment , the tables also list several leading socially conscious funds - a group that did especially well in 1998 . <p> What sets the funds in our listings apart from the pack ? Seasoning , for one thing . All have been in operation for at least three years - most for far longer . Nearly one-half are veterans of a decade or more of market swings . They 've also proved themselves to be top performers among their peers , not just in flashy one-year bursts but over the long haul . Each has a risk-adjusted rate of return over the past three years that places it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow a similar investment style . <p> But past performance is just that - in the past . No one can predict how fast-changing market conditions will affect a fund 's future returns . Still , you can improve your odds by keeping an eye on these key attributes : <p> Low expenses . The purpose of putting money into a mutual fund should be to build wealth for investors - not to enrich the management of a fund with excessive fees and charges . Our investigation screened out funds whose expense ratio - the proportion of assets that are consumed by the fund 's administrative costs - exceeded the median for its peers . At the low end of the range were the large-cap blend funds - a category including a number of super-efficient index funds that passively hold a portfolio of stocks that track the broad market - with a maximum qualifying expense ratio of 1.15 percent of assets . At the upper end were the small-cap growth funds , with an expense ratio of no more than 1.49 percent of assets . <p> No loads or 12b-1 fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load when a new account is opened , a back-end load when an investor sells his or her shares , or so-called 12b-1 fees imposed annually on each shareholder 's account to help defray the fund 's advertising and marketing costs . These extra costs are an expensive drag on your returns - a burden you 're particularly likely to notice in periods when market returns are n't as robust as they have been in recent years . <p> Accessibility . Even the most consistent funds can fall out of favor during the next market cycle , so it 's important to build a portfolio that includes funds that follow different investment styles . To make it easier for investors of modest means to be able to afford that diversification and not tie up all of their investment budget in a single fund , we listed only funds that allow shareholders to open a new account with an initial investment of $5,000 or less . Veterans and newcomers <p> Emphasizing consistency and efficiency has paid off ; two-thirds of the funds making the cut have appeared on our previous years ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally has been led by large-cap funds , which have performed better than 80 percent of all domestic equity funds . The small-cap funds have been out of favor since 1994 , but they were the market leaders earlier in the decade . <p> Many of the biggest names in the industry are well represented in our listings : Fidelity with six funds ; Vanguard with seven ; and T. Rowe Price , the leader , with nine . But some less prominent funds have quietly been turning in noteworthy performances . For example , Clipper , a large-cap value fund making its third appearance on our list , was one of the few equity funds to outperform the market during last summer 's slump . As similar funds dropped 17 percent last July , Clipper managed to limit its losses to half that amount . The fund has long boasted one of the best risk/return profiles in the industry . <p> Among the notable newcomers is Ameristock , an impressive three-year-old large-cap blend fund that handily beat the S &P; 500 index in 1998 . For the fund 's managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year 's strong returns as Ameristock attracts interest from new investors and its asset base grows . Recent research by Morningstar analysts , among others , has demonstrated that performance flags as a fund swells in size . <p> Indeed , some funds , including Fidelity Growth &; Income , Janus Overseas , and Vanguard Primecap , have fallen off our list because they are now closed to new investors - a step managers take to prevent their funds from becoming unwieldy . Some funds simply failed to maintain the investment style and focus that made them standouts in past years . Neuberger Berman Partners , for example , was a leader among midcap value funds in 1997 . But its portfolio now tilts toward large-cap stocks , putting it into a category where , this year , it did not make the cut . And rising fees eliminated the Accessor International Equity fund . A world of risk <p> The market 's swings from record highs to bearish lows were especially dramatic in 1998 . The average fluctuation in stock prices between the highs and lows in the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more than 240 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , according to analysts at Ned Davis Research , a Florida-based investment advisory firm . <p> You can not eliminate this kind of volatility , but some funds have less pronounced peaks and troughs than others . In the column headed " risk , " our tables take into account volatility - measured by how much a fund 's gains or losses have varied from its average monthly return over a three-year period . Using this volatility indicator , technically referred to as the fund 's standard deviation , we sorted all equity funds into five equal-sized groups , or quintiles , from safest to riskiest . Interestingly , given the background of economic turmoil outside the U.S. , the international funds had the least volatility among all of the investment groups we analyzed ; more than one-half of them fell into the lowest-risk quintile . Recommendations <p> Choosing funds that merit your confidence is but the first crucial step in putting together a sensible investment plan . Here are other key issues to consider : <p> Keep it simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three domestic funds and one international fund . For most investors , the most promising place to begin is with an index fund that tracks the S &P; 500 . <p> The advantages of index investing are many . Large-cap index funds own shares in hundreds of bellwether companies . After allowing for the low fees most of these funds charge , index investing ensures that you will earn no less ( and no more ) than the stock market itself - a bet worth making , since over the long term , the indexes have had average annual returns of better than 11 percent . ( Each index fund in the listings is identified with an asterisk . ) <p> With a large-cap index fund as the heart of your equity holdings , consider adding a small-cap growth or blend fund that tries to spot the economy 's future leaders - tomorrow 's Microsoft or Dell Computer . How big you make your small-cap holding depends on how long you can afford to wait for the investment to pay off . If your time horizon is ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 percent of your stock portfolio may be warranted . You may want to round out your portfolio with a good , actively managed fund whose long-term investment style and track record appeal to you . <p> Know what you own . A stock fund is no better than the quality of the companies whose shares it owns and the timing of its ownership . It 's well worth keeping track of what your fund is currently investing in and how much the fund 's returns may hang on the fate of a few companies . A fund is required by federal regulations to publish the size and market value of its portfolio 's recent holdings in its reports to shareholders . <p> There is no magic formula for determining the right number of companies for a fund to invest in . Successful funds can have as few as a couple dozen holdings ( the L. Roy Papp Stock fund has just 25 ) to nearly a thousand ( as in the suitably named Schwab 1000 ) . But no matter how many stocks are in the portfolio of a fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fund industry as " style drift . " That 's what happens when a fund that originally invests in small-cap growth stocks , for example , ends up owning a blend of midcap stocks as the companies outgrow the small-cap limits . The fund may continue to be a strong performer , but if you bought it because you wanted exposure in your portfolio to smaller companies , this fund will no longer fulfill that objective . <p> Watch out for expenses . The fees , expenses , and loads levied by funds add up . For example , a shareholder in the Vanguard 500 Index fund , which boasts the lowest annual expense ratio in our listings at a lean 0.19 percent , would pay just $24 over a ten-year period . By contrast , an owner of a fund with a 5.75 percent front-end load and an annual 0.75 percent 12b-1 fee would shell out $252 , more than ten times as much . <p> Beware of hidden tax traps . Unless you are investing in funds through a tax-deferred account , your mutual fund could end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't sell any of your fund shares . That 's because any trading done by the fund manager as he or she changes the holdings of the fund 's portfolio can produce capital gains , on which shareholders will owe taxes in proportion to their ownership in the fund . <p> To minimize the tax bite , do n't buy shares in a new fund late in the year , just before it distributes its annual capital gains . Also , pay attention to the fund 's turnover ratio , which you can learn from the fund 's prospectus as well as from our tables . The turnover ratio measures how much buying and selling the manager engages in ; a ratio of 100 indicates that the entire value of a fund 's portfolio has been traded over the course of the past year . <p> Stay focused on the long term . With nonstop market news coming at you via newspapers , magazines , radio , cable TV , and the Internet , it 's hard not to get caught up in each uptick or downdraft in the Dow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse to buy or sell on the news of the market 's latest move - behavior that is the very opposite of the patience you will need to reach your investment goals . Investors can expect a strong dose of uncertainty in the months ahead , but building wealth in the long run means putting up with a lot of market turmoil in the here and now . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : First , the ' Viagra effect ' . . .

From an average of fewer than three options offered as recently as 1990 , the typical 401(k) now offers a menu of eight investment choices . <p> The dozen big stock funds listed here in alphabetical order are the most common 401(k) offerings . ( See the Ratings for the explanation of the column headings in the table . ) On the whole , they have been fine performers . For 1998 , nine of them ranked among the top funds tracked by Morningstar , the Chicago-based investment-research firm , and two - Fidelity Magellan and American Century Ultra - even outperformed the S &P; 500 . Only one fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the market as a whole in recent years . <p> If these funds are offered by your employer 's 401(k) plan , they would make a suitable core holding for your retirement savings . But do n't count on being able to buy them as an individual investor . Fidelity Magellan , Fidelity Growth &; Income , Fidelity Contrafund , and Vanguard Windsor I are all closed to new individual accounts . TABLE <p> TIPS FOR MANAGING YOUR EQUITY FUNDS <p> Unlike individual stock portfolios , professionally managed mutual funds generally require relatively little maintenance - their major attraction for many investors . But you ca n't afford to ignore them altogether . Here are some commonsense tips for keeping your investments working for you : <p> Defer taxes . Start by contributing to your 401(k) plan . Not only will it help reduce your taxable income and grow tax-deferred over time , but most also include an employer match . If you meet IRS income-eligibility guidelines that allow you contribute to an individual retirement account or a Keogh plan , take advantage of these tax savings . Remember : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , you will pay a penalty if you withdraw funds before you reach age 59 1/2 . You can also postpone your day of reckoning with the tax collectors by investing after-tax income in a Roth IRA account , where your gains will grow tax-free . If you do invest in a taxable account , find a fund that keeps its turnover - and your potential tax liability - low . <p> Try dollar-cost averaging . By adding to your investments in small steady increments rather than in a single lump sum , you avoid the risk of investing all of your cash at the market 's peak . Moreover , because you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer as they rise , you 'll actually reduce the average cost of the shares you 've purchased over time . For new investors who are willing to commit as little as $50 per month to a dollar-cost averaging program , many funds will reduce or waive the initial investment required to open an account . <p> Diversify and rebalance . Once you 've settled on a long-term investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your portfolio to make sure it does n't drift offtrack . Over time , the widely differing rates of return generated by individual funds can throw your original asset allocation out of kilter - and could expose you to greater risk . Take time every year or two to re-evaluate the balance you 've decided on , then adjust the proportion of new money you invest into the funds in your portfolio accordingly . As you close in on your long-term investment goals , you 'll want to gradually shift your allocation from more-volatile equities to steadier fixed-income bonds . <p> Dump your losers . Selling a fund in response to disappointing short-term returns is ill-advised , but there 's no reason to hold on to a fund that no longer meets your long-term expectations . Consider jettisoning a fund if it has consistently underperformed its peers for more than , say , 18 months or so . Be alert if the fund 's manager is replaced ; there may be a significant shift in the fund 's investment strategy . If you invest in a taxable account and face capital-gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your gains can be offset with capital losses from some other investment . <p> Stay the course . It should be pretty obvious that you ca n't earn money in the stock market unless you stay in the market , yet too many investors lose sight of that fact , as revealed in data from Dalbar , a Boston-based research firm . Analysts there have been tracking the performance of hundreds of mutual funds for the past 14 years , a time when the market rose at an average annual rate of 17.2 percent . Yet Dalbar discovered that mutual-fund shareholders , because they shifted money into and out of funds frequently , earned much less - just 6.7 percent annually , on average . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> Mutual funds RATINGS &; RECOMMENDATIONS Notes on the tables <p> The funds are listed alphabetically , within types , in five groups . The first three sort the funds according to the size of the 5,000 actively traded companies in which they invest : Large-cap funds focus on the 250 largest companies , each with a market capitalization of more than $8.3 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest companies , valued between $1.2 billion and $8.3 billion . Small-cap funds hold shares in the next largest 4,000 businesses , each with a market value of less than $1.2 billion . These groups are further subdivided as follows : Growth funds invest in companies the fund 's manager believes have the potential to post faster earnings growth than their peers . Value funds focus on stocks perceived to be undervalued by the market . Blend funds mix these two approaches . International funds invest primarily in companies based outside the U.S. , and socially conscious funds eschew companies that pollute , sell arms , or exploit workers . Index funds hold shares of companies in the proportion that they make up a well-known market-performance measure , such as the Standard &; Poor 's 500 . They are indicated with an asterisk within the appropriate subcategories . <p> Annualized returns are the average total returns , before taxes and net of the funds ' expenses , for the full year ending December 31 , 1998 , and in 3-year , 5-year , and 10-year periods . Risk indicates a fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month-to-month variation in return , annualized over the past 3 years . The funds are grouped in quintiles , as shown below : Quintile 1 has the least volatility , and quintile 5 the most . Expense ratio is the percentage of the fund 's assets used to pay for annual administrative overhead . Turnover ratio indicates how much buying and selling the fund manager engages in . A ratio of 100 percent means that , on average , the entire value of the fund 's portfolio is turned over once during the course of a year . <p> For More Information You can find detailed facts and figures onmore than 10,000 mutual funds from Mornignstar , the provider of the data from which this list was generated , at the research firm 's web site , www.morningstar.net .
