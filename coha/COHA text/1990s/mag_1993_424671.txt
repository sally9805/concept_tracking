Government has been reinvented before . Here 's why it did n't work <p> It 's early afternoon in the White House Briefing Room . Still fresh to power , the new President and his men stand in front of the famous dark blue curtains to kick off a major new initiative : reinventing the federal government . <p> " We must give top priority to a drastic and thorough revision of the federal bureaucracy , to its budgeting system , and to the procedures for constantly analyzing the effectiveness of its many varied services , " the President had said during last year 's campaign . " . . . This is no job for the fainthearted . It will be met with violent opposition from those who now enjoy a special privilege , those who prefer to work in the dark , or those whose private fiefdoms are threatened . " <p> Hopes are high . " Today , we have submitted to the Congress the first in a series of recommendations for reorganizing the executive branch of Government , " the President says confidently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The afternoon ? July 15 , 1977 . The President ? Jimmy Carter . Thin the ties , shrink the lapels , trim the sideburns and fast forward to 1993 : After a generation of bright federal moments like the $500 billion S &; L collapse , this snippet of Carter and Bert Lance has all the trappings of Bill Clinton and Al Gore 's September kickoff to . . . reinvent the federal government . <p> We 've been here before . Within the last 30 years , LBJ ordered Robert McNamara 's **34;652;TOOLONG Systems instituted governmentwide . Nixon had Management by Objectives . Reagan brought in the Grace Commission . And Bush encouraged Total Quality Management . The result ? Republicans  --  and Perot  --  still score points bashing government , and 80 percent of the public believes that the " country needs to make major changes in the way government works , " according to a 1993 Washington Post/ABC News poll . <p> Now comes Gore 's National Performance Review ( NPR ) to remake government . Despite the jargon ( " It 's time we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Gore is campaigning against end-of-the-fiscal-year spending sprees , has got religion on cutting the bureaucracy , and is intent on simplifying the Byzantine , 450-level job classification system . But the forces that have killed reform in Washington since the days before Sherman Adams grew fond of vicuna coats are lying in wait . Ah , says the Gore team , this time will be different . Why ? Because " one of the major thrusts of what we 're doing is measuring and controlling results , not inputs , " says Bob Stone , the Pentagon reformer who 's directing the Gore review . " Too much of the time in government , we spend a lot of money on a problem and think we 're fixing it . " <p> This is promising talk , but turning talk to action means compelling bureaucrats and politicians to do what they have ducked in years past : Report , in a real way , what they 're really accomplishing . There 's much more at stake here than the fate of another presidential commission . If Washington picks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle  --  that we , in John Kennedy 's phrase , can do better  --  becomes suspiciously squishy . And Democrats will find it harder and harder to convince voters that they know what they 're doing . <p> When Clinton first announced Gore would lead the NPR in March , the President said , " We 'll challenge the basic assumptions of every program , asking does it work , does it provide quality service , does it encourage innovation and reward hard work ? " Consider , however ' the Carter experience . In the seventies , he deployed zero-based budgeting ( ZBB ) to force every agency to reevaluate its reason for being . In Carter 's ZBB , every federal agency sent three plans to the White House every year , one assuming a 20 percent funding cut . ( Carter thought bureaucrats would fess up about what did n't work if faced with declining fortunes . ) Agencies complied , but overburdened the system with reams of forms : 10,000 annual " decision packages " poured in from every corner of the federal map . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> " The Carter administration , with the best of intentions , " says Ronald Johnson , a budgeting scholar at North Carolina 's Research Triangle Institute , " got completely bogged down in forms and spent its time on copious details instead of thinking about the point of a program . " The **31;688;TOOLONG rhetoric died from a thousand paper cuts . But the late seventies were n't bucolic : Energy and jobs and the environment were as bad then as they are now . So why were n't the decision packages eagerly read all over Washington and taken to heart , instead of languishing with Carter ? Is n't that logical ? <p> Logic , meet Congress . Congress has locked in three-fourths of the $1.5 trillion budget and oversees line-item spending for everything from the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System to the Panama Canal Commission . That leaves agencies little power to decide what to spend on their own operations , even on the off-chance bureaucrats admit a program 's wasting money . <p> " Remember , I was sitting at HEW with what was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was Carter 's secretary of the old Health . Education and Welfare department . " And I had very little control over where 75 percent of the money went . Education , for instance , was run by a computer , doling out money by congressional formula , and Congress was n't interested in results as much as they were in getting money appropriated . " <p> Carter failed where Johnson had also failed  --  and for largely the same reasons . Beginning at the Pentagon in 1961 , McNamara deployed a system called PPBS to link dollars to a program 's performance . Analysis of cost-effectiveness would referee where federal money would go . LBJ liked the idea and applied it across the board in 1965 ; by 1971 , it was dead , the victim of agencies who treated the analysis as a paperwork burden and a Congress that ignored the analysis and continued to appropriate money for political , not rational , reasons . <p> To improve their odds , Clinton and Gore speak the language recently repopularized by David Osborne and Ted Gaebler in Reinventing Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ultimate credibility hangs on just that : How much can the government deliver ? And the only way to find out whether the government is delivering is to evaluate what programs do . Two laws  --  the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 and the Governmental Performance and Results Act of 1993  --  now authorize agencies to set goals and measure progress . But neither mandate that budgets be tied to reaching those goals . Here 's an old con to watch out for : Bureaucrats love forms ( remember ZBB ) and counting stuff , because both take time . There 's a world of difference , though , between counting how many grants the Department of Transportation processes , for example , and figuring out whether the roads have fewer potholes . And unless the bureaucrats and the Congress buy in ( remember PPBS ) , this could all be a waste of time . <p> After all , we already count more than the Romans did at the pinnacle of the empire . Today at the Bureau of Labor Statistics , for instance , analysts draw on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two million federal workers in 304 organizations tucked away in 62 agencies undergo the productivity review every year . From the number of cases a Justice Department lawyer handles to the " acres of fine lawn maintained " at American military cemeteries in Italy and Tunisia  --  and around one monument at Gibraltar  --  we spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year collecting these minutiae . Form aid <p> What use is it all put to ? " Damn little , " says Allen Schick , professor of public policy at the University of Maryland . " They 've got so much data on performance already that they do n't know what to do with it . " <p> Consider this : When the General Accounting Office surveyed the 103 big agencies that spent 92 percent of the $1.3 trillion in federal outlays in 1991 , 76 of them assured auditors that they gather information on their own programs . Press a little harder : How many of these agencies had clearly defined goals ? Sixty-seven . And press again : Thirty-three admitted their information-gathering was not related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the information could usefully measure progress . " The federal experience right now is real thin , " admits John Mercer , minority counsel to the Senate Governmental Affairs committee . Two examples from the recent past : For years at the EPA , inspectors who monitored the injection of hazardous waste into underground water sources reported the number of inspection visits  --  not the compliance ( or noncompliance ) the inspections produced . In fact , of the 145 measures that the EPA 's Strategic Management and Planning System used in its water oversight , 30 percent were unconnected to any environmental goal-like cleaner water , which was the point of the enterprise . One measure demanded : " Report , by Region and nationally , the number of proposed EPA orders , the number of final EPA . . . administrative orders , and the number of final State administrative orders issued . " The objective for gathering this data ? " None , " the GAO found . For five years , Congress did n't require two welfare-to-work programs  --  HHS ' JOBS and Agriculture 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined $700 million a year to train the disadvantaged  --  to ask what happened to the people they trained . How many get jobs , how many keep them , how much money are they making ? Or , if trainees were on welfare coming in , did they stay off ? Nobody asked . Instead , the law required managers to calculate " participation rates " and " expenditures by target group . " This means Clinton and Gore must make sure that what agencies call " performance measures " are n't largely irrelevant busywork . Why not ask the essential questions , too , by tracking a percentage of people over time ? <p> Because the essential questions are risky . Their answers  --  such as why the Interior Department spends $66 million irrigating lands for corn , barley , rice , and cotton in the Southwest and the Agriculture Department pays farmers $379 million not to grow crops on that same land  --  are dangerous to the people who make and carry out those orders . So bureaucrats rightly fear " ending up in the papers or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyst puts it . <p> That remark underscores two cultural obstacles the NPR must overcome . First , there is something that Gore has come to believe in the last six months : That the more time spent hunting " waste , fraud , and abuse , " the less constructive evaluation is actually done . In 1978 , Carter established Inspectors General ( IG ) offices in 33 major departments and agencies with , again , the best of intentions . However , IGs thrive on cops-and-robbers , seizing on petty fraud instead of reporting on what works and what does n't . That 's because Congress , in its wisdom , tied the IGs ' own performance to the number of reports generated and the dollars of waste identified . Of course , somebody needs to keep an eye out for corruption , but an inordinate amount of time goes into quick-hit inspections to see whether , say , computer contracting rules are being followed to the letter . Why not evaluate whether the computers the agency bought can do the job ? <p> " The idea behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Health and Human Services inspector general , " but a lot of us became mindlessly adversarial , intimidating our departments instead of thinking about how we could improve what we were doing . " And short of an in-House bank , Congress loves nothing better than a good waste , fraud , and abuse hearing to fulminate about wasting the taxpayers ' dollars . Reagan 's Grace Commission , a panel of private sector leaders who came in to identify government waste in the eighties , also talked more about slashing spending  --  to use budgetspeak  --  than about smartly spending . <p> The effect of all this ? That 's the second obstacle . The NPR is confronting an operation where bureaucrats , accustomed to ducking IGs , fear the risk of exposure . In fact , while the Gore plan to empower employees on the front lines by lifting self-imposed regulations sounds wonderful , and the Vice President has run a smart grass-roots campaign to bring bureaucrats into the game , the empowerment plan is based on the shaky assumptions that federal employees who consciously chose security in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So it is a serious mistake to expect , as most coverage of the NPR has and will , that " Reinvention Labs " and a handful of successful pilots will produce a new government  --  complete with overhead savings  --  any time soon . <p> Take the fate of the great middle management class  --  236,500 out of a General Schedule workforce of 1.5 million  --  which has grown from 8 percent of the government in 1955 to 29 percent today . To save real money with his promised 100,000 ( or more ) job cuts , Clint , on must go after the middle ranks , and the unions ( to whom Gore has been unusually courteous ) say they 're all for that . But in the context of the major corporate restructurings of the last decade , to which both Clinton and Gore approvingly refer , even that 's remarkably tame : Since 1985 , for example . IBM has cut its payroll by 45 percent . The deepest federal cuts , assuming they come at all , would be 5 percent . <p> Yet no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon enough if the administration 's reinvention ideas are going to work . Let 's suppose  --  just suppose  --  that Congress lets agencies make spending decisions on the spot . That has happened before , and there 's strong evidence that reform is n't long for this world once middle managers get hold of it . Consider one of the more complete federal experiments with a key plank of the NPR : results-oriented budgeting , where agencies are given flexibility to spend money as long as performance targets are met . <p> In 1985 , the U.S. Forest Service approved a handful of pilots to test the idea . Out in Oregon 's Ochoco National Forest , rangers streamlined the budget from 27 line items to six , raised productivity by 25 percent , repaired streambeds that had been neglected by Washington budgeters since 1964 , and saved $70,000 the first year . The GAO signed off on the experiment , but by 1989 , Forest Service managers nervous about losing control of the budgeting  --  and the reasons for their gobs  --  withdrew the budgeting power . Ochoco is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're worse off than we were before , " says Rod Collins , an Ochoco supervisor . " The people who handled the money said we were operating outside the culture , and they could n't control what we spent money on . " <p> And this approach is precisely what the administration wants to take national . To counter the inertia that killed the pilots  --  and could massacre the NPR on a grander scale  --  we need a well-staffed Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) genuinely analyzing programs . But OMB 's auditing staff has remained flat for over a generation . In 1955 , for a federal budget of $68.4 billion , OMB had 450 staffers . Forty years , eight presidents , a New Frontier , a Great Society , and $1.5 trillion later , OMB has only 550 staffers , only 140 of whom assess what 's working . ( In contrast , there are 12,000 staffers in the IG offices . ) OMB auditors who visit agencies are like tourists dealing with rug merchants abroad for the first time : Uncertain of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only see the final product  --  in this case , the agency 's budget request  --  and so bargain from weakness . Who knows which division really needs what they 're asking for , or where the fat is ? <p> A quantum leap in making sense of government would mix an OMB warring on mediocrity  --  not waste , fraud , and abuse , but the pedestrian problems of governing  --  and generating clear reports to give the press the authority and means to criticize government in a way that 's now all too rare . The cost is minimal : IGs cost $1.2 billion a year  --  one half of one percent of the budget . Even doubling that is nothing compared to the $100 billion in federal mismanagement costs the House Budget committee identified in 1991 . Performance smart <p> So with vigilance and a touch of honesty , things can change . One of the most ambitious pieces of domestic legislation in the eighties , the Job Training Partnership Act ( JTPA ) , offspring of an odd political one-night stand in 1982 between Senators Ted Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set outcomes , how agencies will try to fool you , and how reform can win out . <p> The $2 billion program , which reaches two million adults and teenagers , sets clear-cut goals ( 60 percent of trainees must be working three months after the program ends ) . If managers fail for two years running , the feds force the local agency to alter its program . It was not always thus . At first , JTPA required its offices just to count immediate job placements , which encouraged local administrators to exclude the hard-core unemployed or the homeless . Called " creaming , " this hustle of only counting the best let the local operators meet their standards without breaking a sweat . Once the Labor Department caught on to the gimmick , it set the bar higher : Sixty-five percent of the people enrolled must be long-term unemployed or dropouts or homeless . <p> Why is n't everybody doing this ? " The problem is , accountability is an all-or-nothing proposition , " says one Labor Department evaluator . " Once you agree to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then as an agency you ca n't dodge responsibility . And that 's terrifying to the bureaucratic mind . " Yet terror can be a force for good . In the fifties and sixties , for example , when the IRS audited more returns and hauled more people in for cheating on their taxes , tax compliance was higher than it is now because people were scared they 'd get caught . The same principle holds true here : As long as agencies think there 's a possibility of evaluation , they 're more likely to do their jobs . <p> The Democrats ' task now is to prove that the feds can accomplish smart things and be held accountable for broad policy outcomes like repairing bridges or housing the poor , even when the federal role is simply writing a check to a state or local government . And while Clinton and Gore are avoiding the Carter/LBJ mistake of instant implementation , the past tells us that an administration 's interest in government reform dims as the years wear on . Because private sector renovations of this scale take 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnover is the rule , not the exception  --  what sounds grand today will seem dated before long . Just ask Fred Malek , who was Nixon 's OMB point man on Management by Objectives , a plan launched in 1971 to make agencies map out strategic plans and base budget decisions on their progress . ( Sound familiar ? ) " This was a great plan , and a workable one , " Malek says now . " But the big push for it had to come in 1974  --  and and as you know , President Nixon and his men had other things on their minds in 1974 . " If the incumbent administration fails to bring along Congress and defeat the bureaucrats this time , the next guys who try this will have to contend with a system that much more experienced at pulling the plug on the most gee-whiz of reinventions . And the system 's got plenty of experience at that already . <p> Research assistance for this article was provided by Spencer Freedman , Maia Garau , Alan Greenblatt , and Jennifer Levitsky . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
