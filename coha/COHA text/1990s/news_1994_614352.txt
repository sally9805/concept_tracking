<p> Nathalie Dupree 's white chocolate cheesecake falls , but her hair does n't . <p> She smiles right through the ginger-apricot flan that never sets and makes the best of an uncooperative pie crust . The floral chintz dress hides a few green peppercorn sauce stains . <p> Yes , Nathalie Dupree is unflappable - but then she has to be . Host of the second-most popular cooking show on public television ( behind " The Frugal Gourmet " ) , best-selling author and longtime champion of Southern cuisine , Dupree has built her grits-and-gravy empire on food that works . " I want people to understand that when something goes wrong , " she says , " it can be fixed . " <p> She should know . Dupree , 54 , has been fixing things for decades , not just in the kitchen but in a private life that 's included far more pain and heartache than her sunny TV sets would suggest . Her cheerful Cusinart chatter belies a troubled past , including the trials of being a single foster mother , two divorces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing so many friends and associates to AIDS . <p> " I do n't think of myself as amazing , but I 've had a lot of grace , " Dupree says . " That 's what 's gotten me through . " <p> Now , Dupree is tasting success . " Nathalie Dupree 's Southern Memories , " her cookbook that features recipes and essays on everything from azaleas to oysters , earned the prestigious James Beard Award for Americana cookbook writing in New York early this month , a sign that the cutthroat food critics ' community had at last recognized Dupree and her chosen cuisine as serious . <p> Her recent barefoot wedding on a Jamaican beach to author-historian Jack Bass ended 18 years of single life , and her cooking programs and companion cookbooks remain perennial favorites . At last , Dupree seems to have found the public recognition and private happiness that have proven so elusive . <p> " My mother never wanted me to go into cooking ; she said it was n't a profession suitable for a lady , " Dupree says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people how to cook . " <p> Armed with $ 1,000 and a couple of degrees from London 's Cordon Bleu cooking school , Nathalie Dupree began feeding others 23 years ago when she opened a small restaurant in Social Circle , Ga . " Nathalie 's " quickly became an institution , and Dupree parlayed that into her own cooking school at Rich 's department store in 1975 . The cookbooks and TV series followed soon thereafter . <p> Along the way , Dupree discovered her folksy charm and easy laugh were just as important to her success as her cheese straws . And she forged friendships that survive to this day . <p> " I was a member of Nathalie 's first class , and I remember her thoroughness and patience , " says Pat Royalty , a Buckhead housewife who now helps out on her TV shows . " We stayed in touch , on and off . But I 've had two deaths in the family , and Nathalie was there for me immediately . " <p> But Dupree 's success has neither made her rich nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she so badly needs . The White Lily Foods Co. of Knoxville , remains her only financial backer , and Dupree routinely takes out six-figure loans and extra mortgages to finance her shows , which cost $ 10,000 per episode to produce . <p> Not surprisingly , she is frustrated . <p> " My show is a hit in Hong Kong , and I ca n't even get an appointment here with Coca-Cola , " she says . " You 'd think somebody would want to sponsor us , but no . Kroger told me they did n't want a national show , then I 'm told by national people that I 'm too regional . " <p> Like many self-made successes , however , Dupree admits she 's often her own worst enemy , and her insecurities and idiosyncrasies have hurt her cause . Still , she is not afraid to take a stand . A political junkie from way back - Dupree worked for John F. Kennedy 's Young Democrats in 1960 - she also helped stage a rally in support of Salman Rushdie 's controversial " Satanic Verses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red ribbon AIDS pin on the air , even though it prompts hate mail from viewers . <p> " It always startles me when I make enemies , but I have them , " she says . " Usually it 's my own doings . I make a lot of mistakes , I 'm headstrong , I 'm a perfectionist . " <p> Even close friends say Dupree 's refusal to accept second-best is maddening . In restaurants , she does n't hesitate to send subpar food back or scold sloppy servers ( " You 'd be amazed at how dense many waiters and waitresses are and how little they care , " she says ) . She demands such a high standard of excellence from her staff that the tension in the kitchen and on the set is very real indeed . <p> Yet Dupree pushes no one harder than herself . Juggling several projects at once - including a cooking demonstration at Macy 's in New York , dinner at Ethel Kennedy 's house in Washington , D.C. , and final checks on her next cookbook - Dupree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were practically begging her to stop and eat . <p> Ray Overton , who rose to culinary director on Dupree 's show over a 5 1/2-year tenure that ended in 1993 , says , " Nathalie puts everything she has into the business , but it never seems to be enough . " <p> Nathalie Dupree 's pain is not far below the surface , and it comes out in the most surprising places . As a food columnist at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution from 1987 to 1988 , she mixed recipes for dishes such as roast lamb and blue-cheese dip with very frank and revealing essays on love and the loneliness of childhood . <p> And talking to a virtual stranger , she openly discusses the heart- wrenching pain of learning her second husband is gay . <p> " It was devastating , " Dupree says quietly , sitting in front of a makeup mirror in her dressing room . The James Beard Award medal is slung casually over the door ; the contents of her purse are scattered all over the table , and Dupree is poking idly through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose anyone you love , and I think it 's particularly hard when you lose a person because it ca n't work . That 's what made it really , really hard . <p> " But keeping David would have been like keeping a caged bird , and I could n't do that . " <p> David Dupree first laid eyes on Nathalie Dupree at a party in a sparse New York flat in 1969 . Divorced from her first husband ( a Democratic activist with whom she broke up after a year ) , Dupree made up for the lack of canapes with her panache . Says David Dupree : " I turned to a Japanese guitar player I did n't know and said , ' That 's the woman I 'm going to marry . ' " <p> But while David Dupree gave his new wife the extended family she 'd always craved and fully supported her burgeoning career as a cooking teacher and entrepreneur , his own sexuality had begun to emerge . And Nathalie Dupree 's upbringing in the Christian Science faith had in no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I prayed hard enough David would change , and I think he thought so , too , " she says . " It took a long time for me to realize it was not a matter of choice . Gay people do n't get married out of meanness . They get married because they want what straight people want . I was naive , but the world was naive then . I was Superwoman , after all , and I thought I could make everything better . " <p> Divorced in 1977 , Nathalie Dupree and David Dupree remain quite close . She calls him her " favorite former husband . " In fact , Dupree dedicated the " Southern Memories " cookbook to him , and mentioned him in her victory speech at the James Beard Award ceremony . <p> David Dupree , meanwhile , moved to San Francisco a year ago in order to give them both more space . Atlanta , it seems , was too small , and the memories were too strong . " It took us about three years after the divorce just to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nathalie Dupree does not shy away from life . She reckons she had " about 100 " marriage proposals by the time she was 30 - most half- hearted , she warns - and life following her second divorce was equal parts trial and triumph . <p> Dupree adopted two teenage foster daughters in 1978 because , as she says , " I wanted to know what it felt like to have children of my own . " But Gail and Audrey Odegard proved to be more than that ; they were young women eager to test their independence rather than acquire another mother . <p> Gail , then 15 , had already lived in four foster homes and lasted just a 1 1/2 years before running away again . Audrey , two years older and more stable , went off to college after a year . But the conflicts and tears in that time helped Dupree forge a bond with her so-called " nearly daughters " that has been renewed - albeit slowly - in adulthood . <p> " We had a lot of problems , but we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gail are talented , beautiful and smart ; they married good men . I 'm so proud of them . " <p> Dupree pauses . " Helping raise them is the only thing I 've done that 's worthwhile in my life , " she says . <p> Yet Dupree often struggled to keep her own emotions in check . Turning increasingly to alcohol in the late ' 80s to both temper her pain and enhance her pleasure , she made a tough admission in 1989 . <p> " I 'm an alcoholic , " she says . " Not your classic one , but I came to realize I was not a very good drinker . I did n't even drink until David and I got divorced ; after that , it was hard to stop . But I 'm in a 12-step program now , and I even advocate using alcohol-free wine to cook with on the show . " <p> The first time Jack Bass called on the telephone , Nathalie Dupree was almost rude to him . Curt , anyway . He was looking for someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual friend suggested one of Dupree 's literary salons . Begun in the late 1980s , the parties offered Dupree 's Ansley Park house and lavish gourmet meals , and it was not uncommon to find New Orleans chef Paul Prudhomme or authors Pat Conroy and Anne Rivers Siddons there . <p> But Dupree told Bass she was too busy . Bass says Dupree was " abrupt . " <p> " I get about 100 phone calls a day , " she insists , " I have to be abrupt . " <p> Still , the party went off as planned on Oct. 16 , 1993 . Six months later , Bass and Dupree were married . What came in between is described by both as serendipity . <p> " There was good chemistry , " says Bass , a writer and historian based in Oxford , Miss . Seated beside Dupree on a couch , the two act like , well , newlyweds . Dupree slaps his thigh playfully and snuggles under his arm while Bass gently reaches over and brushes Dupree 's blond hair out of her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was really impressed , " Bass continues . " I was impressed by the stories she told and the way she told them . It said a lot about her , and I found out I wanted to know more . " <p> He smiles . " And when I found Nathalie likes to go to baseball games and keep score , I thought , ' Oh boy , there 's really some potential there . ' " <p> But this was the third marriage for both . In fact , Dupree could n't even bring herself to say the word " marriage " the day before the ceremony - referring to the wedding as " it " instead . <p> But if the ceremony was light and breezy - the groom wore khaki shorts and th e bride borrowed her dress from another guest in the hotel - the marriage so far is a study in applied maturity . <p> Bass plans to relocate to Atlanta to work on his next book this summer , while Dupree is considering accompanying Bass back to Oxford in January . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are making time to just sit and be with another person ; one day a week , at least . <p> " We 're still moony-eyed , " Dupree says . " It 's different this time . This is a real working partnership . "
