Editor 's note : Jack London first achieved fame in 1903 when the Post published The Call of the Wild . His short story , " Under the Deck-Awnings , " appeared in the Post 's Nov. 19 , 1910 , issue . <p> " Can any man  --  a gentleman , I mean  --  call a woman a pig ? " The little man flung this challenge forth to the whole group , then leaned back in his deckchair , sipping lemonade with an air commingled of certitude and watchful belligerence . Nobody made answer . They were used to the little man and his sudden passions and high elevations . <p> " I repeat , it was in my presence that he said a certain lady , whom none of you knows , was a pig . He did not say swine . He grossly said that she was a pig . And I hold that no man who is a man could possibly make such a remark about any woman . " <p> Doctor Dawson puffed stolidly at his black pipe . Matthews , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed in the flight of a guny . Sweet , finishing his Scotch and soda , was questing about with his eyes for a deck-steward . <p> " I ask you , Mr. Treloar , can any man call any woman a pig ? " <p> Treloar , who happened to be sitting next to him , was startled by the abruptness of the attack , and wondered what grounds he had ever given the little man to believe that he could call a woman a pig . <p> " I should say , " he began his hesitant answer , " that it  --  er  --  depends on the  --  er  --  the lady . " <p> The little man was aghast . <p> " You mean  --  " he quavered . <p> " That I have seen female humans who were as bad as pigs  --  and worse . " <p> There was a long , painful silence . The little man seemed withered by the coarse brutality of the reply . In his face was unutterable hurt and woe . <p> " You have told of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classified him , " Treloar said in cold , even tones . " I shall now tell you about a woman  --  I beg your pardon  --  a lady  --  and when I have finished I shall ask you to classify her . Miss Caruthers I shall call her , principally for the reason that it is not her name . It was on a P. &; O. boat , and it occurred several years ago . <p> " Miss Caruthers was charming . No ; that is not the word . She was amazing . She was a young woman and a lady . Her father was a certain high official whose name , if I mentioned it , would be immediately recognized by all of you . She was with her mother and two maids at the time , going out to join the old gentleman wherever you like to wish in the East . <p> " She  --  and pardon me for repeating  --  was amazing . It is the one adequate word . Even the most minor adjectives applicable to her are bound to be sheer superlatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any woman and than most men . Sing , play  --  bah !  --  as some rhetorician once said of old Nap , competition fled from her . Swim ! She could have made a fortune and a name as a public performer . She was one of those rare women who can strip off all the frills of dress and in a simple swimming suit be more satisfyingly beautiful . Dress ! She was an artist . Her taste was unerring . <p> " But her swimming . Physically , she was the perfect woman  --  you know what I mean ; not in the gross , muscular way of acrobats , but in all the delicacy of line and fragility of frame and texture ; and combined with this , strength . How she could do it was the marvel . You know the wonder of a woman 's arm  --  the forearm , I mean ; the sweet fading away from rounded biceps and hint of muscle , down through small elbow and firm , soft swell to the wrist , small  --  unthinkably small and round and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her swimming the sharp , quick English overhand stroke , and getting somewhere with it too , was  --  well , I understand anatomy and athletics and such things , and yet it was a mystery to me how she could do it . <p> " She could stay under water for two minutes . I have timed her . No man on board , except Dennitson , could capture as many coins as she with a single dive . On the forward main deck was a big canvas tank with six feet of seawater . We used to toss small coins into it . I have seen her dive from the bridge deck  --  no mean feat in itself  --  into that six feet of water and fetch up no less than forty-seven coins , scattered at random over the whole bottom of the tank . Dennitson , a quiet young Englishman , never exceeded her in this , though he made it a point always to tie her score . <p> " She was a sea-woman , true . But she was a land-woman , a horsewoman  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all softness of flowing dress , surrounded by half a dozen eager men , languidly careless of them , or flashing brightness and wit on them and at them and through them , one would fancy she was good for nothing else in the world . At such moments I have compelled myself to remember her score of forty-seven coins from the bottom of the swimming tank . But that was she  --  the everlasting wonder of a woman who did all things well . <p> " She fascinated every betrousered human around her . She had me  --  and I do n't mind confessing it  --  she had me to heel along with the rest . Young puppies and old gray dogs who ought to have known better  --  oh , they all came up and crawled round her skirts and whined and fawned when she whistled . They were all guilty , from young Ardmore , a pink cherub of nineteen , outward bound for some clerkship in the consular service , to old Captain Bentley , grizzled and seaworn , and as emotional , to look at , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chap , Perkins , I believe , who forgot his wife was on board until Miss Caruthers sent him to the right-about and back where he belonged . <p> " Men were wax in her hands . She melted them , or softly moulded them , or incinerated them , as she pleased . There was n't a steward , even , grand and remote as she was , who at her bidding would have hesitated to souse the Old Man himself with a plate of soup . You have all seen such women  --  a sort of world 's desire to all men . As a man-conqueror she was supreme . She was a whiplash , a sting and a flame , an electric spark . Oh , believe me , at times there were flashes of will that scorched through her beauty and seduction and smote a victim into blank and shivering idiocy and fear ! <p> " And do n't fail to mark , in the light of what is to come , that she was a prideful woman : pride of race , pride of caste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all , a pride strange and willful and terrible . <p> " She ran the ship , she ran the voyage , she ran everything  --  and she ran Dennitson . That he had outdistanced the pack even the least wise of us admitted . That she liked him , and that this feeling was growing , there was not a doubt . I am certain that she looked on him with kinder eyes than she had ever looked with on man before . We still worshipped and were always hanging about waiting to be whistled up , though we knew that Dennitson was laps and laps ahead of us . What might have happened we shall never know , for we came to Colombo and something else happened . <p> " You know Colombo , and how the native boys dive for coins in the shark-infested bay ? Of course it is only among the ground sharks and fish sharks that they venture . It is almost uncanny the way they know sharks and can sense the presence of a real killer  --  a tiger shark , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But let such a shark appear and , long before the passengers can guess , every mother 's son of them is out of the water in a wild scramble for safety . <p> " It was just after tiffin and Miss Caruthers was holding her usual court under the deck-awnings . Old Captain Bentley had just been whistled up and had granted her what he had never granted before  --  nor since  --  permission for the boys to come up on the promenade deck . You see , Miss Caruthers was a swimmer and she was interested . She took up a collection of all our small change and herself tossed it overside , singly and in handfuls , arranging the terms of the contests , chiding a miss , giving extra rewards to clever wins ; in short , managing the whole exhibition . <p> " She was especially keen on their jumping . You know , jumping feet-first from a height , it is very difficult to hold the body perpendicularly while in the air . The center of gravity of the human body is high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beggars employed a method new to her , which she desired to learn . Leaping from the davits of the boat deck above , they plunged downward , their faces and shoulders bowed forward , looking at the water : and only at the last moment did they abruptly straighten up and enter the water erect and true . <p> " It was a pretty sight . Their diving was not so good , though there was one of them who was excellent at it , as he was at all the other stunts . Some man must have taught him , for he made the proper swan dive and did it as beautifully as I have ever seen it done . You know , it is head-first into the water ; and from a great height the problem is to enter the water at the perfect angle . Miss the angle and it means at the least a twisted back and injury for life . Also , it has meant death for many a bungler . This boy could do it  --  seventy feet I know he cleared in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head thrown back , sailing more like a bird , upward and out , and out and down , body flat on the air , so that if it struck the surface in that position it would be split in half like a herring . But the moment before the water is reached the head drops forward , the hands go out and lock the arms in an arch in advance of the head , and the body curves gracefully downward and enters the water just right . <p> " This the boy did again and again to the delight of all of us , but particularly of Miss Caruthers . He could not have been a moment over twelve or thirteen , yet he was by far the cleverest of the gang . He was the favorite of his crowd and its leader . Though there were many older than he , they acknowledged his chieftaincy . He was a beautiful boy , a lithe young god in breathing bronze , eyes wide apart , intelligent and daring  --  a bubble , a mote , a beautiful flash and sparkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , anything , a leopard , a horse  --  restless , eager , too much alive ever to be still , silken of muscle , each slightest movement a benediction of grace , every action wild , untrammeled , and over all spilling out that intense vitality , that sheen and luster of living light . The boy had it . Life poured out of him almost in an effulgence . His skin glowed with it . It burned in his eyes . I swear I could almost hear it crackle from him . Looking at him , it was as if a whiff of ozone came to one 's nostrils  --  so fresh and young was he , so resplendent with health , so wildly wild . <p> " This was the boy , and it was he who gave the alarm in the midst of the sport . The boys made a dash of it for the gangway platform , swimming the fastest strokes they knew , pell-mell , floundering and splashing , fright in their faces , clambering out with jumps and surges , any way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till all were strung along the gangway and peering down into the water . <p> " ' What is the matter ? ' asked Miss Caruthers . <p> " ' A shark , I fancy , ' Captain Bentley answered . ' Lucky little beggars that he did n't get one of them . ' <p> " ' Are they afraid of sharks ? ' she asked . <p> " ' Are n't you ? ' he asked back . <p> She shuddered , looked overside at Ule water and made a moue . <p> " ' Not for the world would I venture where a shark might be , ' she said , and shuddered again . ' They are horrible ! Horrible ! ' <p> " The boys came up on the promenade deck , clustering close to the rail and worshipping Miss Caruthers , who had flung them such a wealth of bakshish . The performance being over , Captain Bentley motioned to them to clear out ; but she stopped him . <p> " ' One moment , please , Captain . I have always understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " She beckoned the boy of the swan dive nearer to her and signed to him to dive over again . He shook his head and , along with all his crew behind him , laughed as if it were a good joke . <p> " ' Shark , ' he volunteered , pointing to the water . <p> " ' No ! ' she said . ' There is no shark . ' <p> " But he nodded his head positively and the boys behind him nodded with equal positiveness . <p> " ' No , no , no ! ' she cried . And then to us : ' Who 'll lend me a half-crown and a sovereign ? ' <p> " Immediately the half-dozen of us were presenting her with half-crowns and sovereigns , and she accepted the two coins from young Ardmore . <p> " She held up the half-crown for the boys to see , but there was no eager rush to the rail preparatory to leaping . They stood there grinning sheepishly . She offered the coin to each one individually , and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his calf , shook his head and grinned . Then she tossed the half-crown overboard . With wistful , regretful faces they watched its silver slight through the air , but not one moved to follow it . <p> " ' Do n't do it with the sovereign , ' Dennitson said to her in a low voice . <p> " She took no notice , but held up the gold coin before the eyes of the boy of the swan dive . <p> " ' Do n't ! ' said Captain Bentley . ' I would n't throw a sick cat overside with a shark around . ' <p> " But she laughed , bent on her purpose , and continued to dazzle the boy . <p> " ' Do n't tempt him , ' Dennitson urged . ' It is a fortune to him and he might go over after it . ' <p> " ' Would n't you ? ' she flared at him . ' If I threw it ? ' This last more softly . <p> " Dennitson shook his head . <p> " ' Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many sovereigns would you go ? ' <p> " ' There are not enough coined to get me overside , ' was his answer . <p> " She debated a moment , the boy forgotten in her tilt with Dennitson . <p> " ' For me ? ' she said very softly . <p> " ' To save your life  --  yes ; but not otherwise . ' <p> " She turned back to the boy . Again she held the coin before his eyes , dazzling him with the vastness of its value . Then she made as if to toss it out , and involuntarily he made a half movement toward the rail , but was checked by sharp cries of reproof from his companions . There was anger in their voices as well . <p> " ' I know it is only fooling , ' Dennitson said . ' Carry it as far as you like , but for Heaven 's sake do n't throw it . ' <p> " Whether it was that strange willfulness of hers , or whether she doubted the boy could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all of us . Out from the shade of the awning the coin flashed golden in the blaze of sunshine and fell toward the sea in a glittering arch . Before a hand could stay him the boy was over the rail and curving beautifully downward after the coin . Both were in the air at the same time . It was a pretty sight . The sovereign cut the water sharply , and at the very spot , almost at the same instant with scarcely a splash , the boy entered . <p> " From the quicker-eyed boys watching came an exclamation . We were all at the rail . Do n't tell me it is necessary for a shark to turn on its back . That one did n't . In the clear water , from the height we were above it , we saw everything . The shark was a big brute and with one drive he cut the boy squarely in half . <p> " There was a murmur or something from among us  --  who made it I did not know ; it might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first to speak . Her face was deathly white . <p> " ' I  --  I never dreamed ! ' she said , and laughed a short , hysterical laugh . <p> " All her pride was at work to give her control . She tutned weakly toward Dennitson , and then on from one to another of us . In her eyes was a terrible sickness and her lips were trembling . We were brutes  --  oh , I know it , now that I look back upon it ; but we did nothing ! <p> " ' Mr. Dennitson , ' she said  --  ' Tom , wo n't you take me below ? ' <p> " He never changed the direction of his gaze , which was the bleakest I have ever seen in a man 's face ; nor did he move an eyelid . He took a cigarette from his case and lighted it . Captain Bentley made a nasty sound in his throat and spat overboard . That was all  --  that and the silence . <p> " She turned away and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she swayed and thrust a hand against the wall to save herself ; and so she went on , supporting herself against the cabins and walking very slowly . " <p> Treloar ceased . He turned his head and favored the little man with a look of cold inquiry . " Well ? " he said finally . " Classify her . " <p> The little man gulped and swallowed . <p> " I have nothing to say , " he said . " Nothing whatever to say . " <p>
