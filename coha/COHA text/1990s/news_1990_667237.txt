<p> Russ Egbert stands before his secondhand McDonald 's grill in the basement of the Auburn University animal-sciences building , flipping sizzling meat patties with practiced ease . Four minutes on each side , checked by his digital watch , and he has the perfect A.U. Lean burger . <p> Egbert has cooked upward of 50,000 beef patties in the 2 1/2 years that he and Dale Huffman , his mentor in meat science , spent coming up with a low-fat beef patty that looks and tastes just like hamburger . " I 'm kind of picky , " he says . " I do n't like anybody else to cook them . I can kind of tell when they 're done . " <p> There should be plenty more burgers hitting the griddle soon . McDonald 's Corp . is testing a version of the low-fat burger , which it calls the Lean Deluxe , in Harrisburg , Pa . Results have been promising . This week , McDonald 's will expand the test to Minneapolis ; Toledo , Ohio ; Knoxville , Tenn. ; and Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Since the burger 's debut last month , Huffman , 59 , a professor of meat science , and Egbert , 33 , a doctoral candidate , have n't been able to get off the phone . <p> What everybody 's calling about is a new kind of ground beef that , if the Auburn researchers get their way , soon will be in supermarkets and restaurants everywhere . Both the A.U. Lean and the Lean Deluxe contain less than 10% fat , less than half the fat of regular hamburger . <p> To fast-food retaurants , low-fat beef would be manna from heaven - a way to improve their junk-food image without sacrificing their most popular product . Beef processors are thrilled because low-fat beef could slow the 10- year decline in red-meat consumption . Cattle producers are excited because it could raise prices for lean beef . And nutritionists are elated because it could dramatically lower the amount of fat Americans eat . <p> The response since the Lean Deluxe was announced has raised Egbert 's and Huffmann 's hopes that low-fat beef patties might appear on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already has hit the proselytizing trail : He persuaded the federal school-lunch program to test low-fat beef this spring . Now he 's looking to convince an upscale supermarket chain to offer low-fat ground beef to health-conscious customers . " Our objective is to get this stuff out , " he says . <p> Auburn 's better burger basically allows Americans to eat their cake and have it , too - to mix a food metaphor . Regular ground beef contains 20% to 30% fat . It 's the biggest source of fat in Americans ' diet . But we love it anyway : Ground beef makes up nearly 45% of the 3 billion pounds of beef consumed every year . That 's the equivalent of 5.4 billion quarter-pound hamburgers . Obviously , a low-fat hamburger would be a virtually painless way to reduce the fat in people 's diets . Once someone starts marketing it , the low-fat beef patty should sell like its griddlemate , hot cakes . <p> That 's what McDonald 's hopes , anyway . In 1987 , its director of nutrition , Michael Goldblatt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to give its customers a low-fat burger . Come up with the product , he said , and McDonald 's would provide the market . <p> What the world 's largest restaurant chain wants , it gets . The Meat Board handed out $ 300,000 to Huffman and Egbert  --  to come up with a low-fat patty . <p> Huffman and Egbert , however , probably wo n't get a dime for developing A.U. Lean . The Meat Board decided the low-fat beef patty is n't patentable . " This was primarily a recipe , " says David Hurt , vice president of research . Although the makeup of McDonald 's Lean Deluxe is proprietary , the recipe for A.U. Lean is no secret . In fact , it was published in the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station bulletin last year , turning the issue into a best-seller . All 4,000 copies have been snapped up . " Meat packers can read that , go into the plant and , if they 've got any sense at all , make the product , " Huffman says . <p> That 's because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments , is really kind of simple . Very low-fat ground beef - 95% to 98% fat-free - already exists . It 's made by defatting certain lean cuts of beef . The problem is , it tastes terrible . Cook it and it turns out dry and flavorless . <p> " We knew we had to add something . We could n't just reduce the fat , " Egbert says . But they did n't want to add much . Consumers tend to be very fussy about anything less than 100% pure beef , Huffman says . Above all , they did n't want to add soy - it " has such a bad rap , " Huffman says . <p> So what they added was water - to keep the burger moist - and carrageenan , a food additive made from red seaweed that also is used in hot dogs - to keep in the moisture during cooking . Egbert whipped up the first batches in a Kitchen-Aid mixer bowl . <p> There was a dash of luck in the recipe . Other researchers had tried other kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrageenan because as a dairy-science undergraduate at Utah State , he 'd used it to make ice cream . Because fat adds flavor to hamburger , Huffman and Egbert added some spice to their version . They tried red pepper , white pepper , black pepper and monosodium glutamate before settling on hydrolyzed vegetable protein , a flavoring used in soy sauce and hot dogs . <p> Each permutation was tested by a 30-member taste panel recruited from among Auburn students , lab technicians and faculty . The panel ate burgers that had been grilled , fried and broiled . They ate burgers that were 2.5% fat and burgers that were 20% fat . They ate finely ground and coarse-ground beef . They ate under scientific conditions in a six-booth tasting room illuminated by a red light so they would n't be influenced by the burgers ' appearance , and they ate crackers and drank apple juice between tests . They ate their way through seven separate studies and gave the final thumbs-up to A.U. Lean . <p> Cooking up burgers in the lab is one thing . Making them en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 4,000- pound batch of A.U. Lean was tested at Keystone Foods Corp . in West Chester , Pa . Keystone is McDonald 's largest meat supplier , shipping 3 million pounds of ground beef a week . <p> It was n't the first time that Keystone had tested a low-fat burger . " We 've probably seen in the hundreds , " says Senior Vice President Hector Coats . Little wonder then that when A.U. Lean made its debut , its stage mother was a nervous wreck . " I was almost sick that morning , " Egbert says . But A.U. Lean passed and Keystone took the patties to McDonald 's , which sampled them in a blind taste test . <p> " Ours came out on top , " Egbert says . <p> The rest , as they say , is gastronomic history . McDonald 's reformulated A.U. Lean to suit itself and to make it workable in the vast McDonald 's system . It changed the fat content , - which ranges from 7.5% to 9% , it changed the cuts of beef used and it changed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We changed everything but the carrageenan , " Goldblatt says . <p> When the Lean Deluxe will go nationwide McDonald 's wo n't say . Back in their basement lab , Huffman and Egbert are cooking up a low-fat fresh pork sausage . But this time , when they test it , they 'll have a side dish . As a reward for his labors to lower the nation 's fat count , Keystone gave Egbert a present : his very own McDonald 's french-fries maker . <p> TEXT OF GRAPHIC Recipe for a low-fat burger The A.U. lean 1 lb. very lean ground beef ( 95% to 98% fat-free ) 1 1/2 oz. water 0.07 oz.
