When we were children , my brother , Frank , and I handled our mother 's danger signals differently . <p> Mama could pluck a word from a simple statement , then snap it back covered with ice . Her very blue eyes could deepen from midday sky-blue to late-afternoon darkening blue , or worse , to **28;782;TOOLONG blue . Her normal alto-toned voice could rise to middle ( command tone ) , or worse , the high pitch of fear . <p> My way of coping with these shifting moods was to initiate very little conversation . I grew more and more skillful at reading the many blues of my mother 's eyes , and the three main levels of her voice . Her face became my barometer , my instrument for peace , especially when the three of us were together <p> Frank , whose life burst forth in dramatic gestures and a big voice , would pull down the curtain at the first sign of trouble and turn the spotlight on me . Pushed to center stage , I would be furious and fearful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would attempt to change the subject or take one aspect of it and develop it so that it looked as though we had both misunderstood him . Maybe that is how I learned to make up stories . <p> But there was something else . In spite of my fear of my mother 's mood swings , I craved both expression and adventure  --  especially at the time of this memory . <p> In April of 1928 , I was just past twelve and Frank almost ten . My restlessness was at a high , and had no place to go . Sex education in the schools did not exist , nor did we have it at home . Sensations were puzzled over , kept secret , like finding out about death , or that your grandfather had a mistress . Once I found neatly folded oblong pieces of flannel in my mother 's dresser . At nine , I paid no attention . But I had found them again recently and wondered . I thought the objects had something to do with being a woman , in the sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I did not ask . And was not told . <p> All of these things were on my mind that Thursday night in April when the three of us were at the supper table . My brother , with wild gestures of arms and hands , was describing a branch , fallen from a dead tree , that he and his friend Donald had found in the park . Mama 's eyes were a lovely afternoon blue . The branch , he narrated , stretched down into a shallow ravine . Interlacing branches and dead leaves made a roof . By breaking through some of the branches , the boys had made a hidden cave . <p> " We 're having a club there , " he said . " No girls . " <p> A faint alarm interrupted my thoughts . Frank was headed toward dangerous ground  --  a hidden cave !  --  but before I could alert him with a discreet kick , Mama spoke . Low voice , but her eyes were approaching evening . " I do n't want you sneaking into hidden places , Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both were coated with ice . <p> Frank delved into mashed potatoes . I got a not too discreet kick . <p> I delved into a deep breath to calm my annoyance and find my lines . " It 's not a good cave at all , " I exhaled . " It 's only a dead branch . You can see right through it . Anyhow , the park men are going to lug it away " <p> I had never seen the fallen branch . I knew nothing about carting away dead trees . I was uneasy . My legs wanted to stretch to ease sensations higher up that embarrassed me . I was mad . It was like somebody giving me information I needed to save my life , but the tone was so muffled I could n't hear it . <p> After a tense interval , I looked up . Mama looked ill , not angry , not quite fearful . Why ? Did she know that I had never seen Frank 's branch ? If so , why did n't she accuse me in her top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Later , with rare intimacy , Mama said , " I worry about Frank . He needs his father " The retort What about me ? died in my throat as she concluded her concern : " It 's hard to raise a boy alone . You will have to help . " <p> Before I went to sleep , I tried to sink into my pirate chest , my inner treasury of memories . I wanted my father , but all I could bring up was a picture of my mother without any face , just a long skirt and hands wrapped around a tray , noiselessly climbing the stairs that led to my dying father . <p> When we came home from school at lunchtime the next day , Mama told Frank that he was having lunch at Donald 's house and then going back to school with him . " Mrs. Hopkins is waiting for you , " she said . <p> She stood at the door of the dining room just off the landing of our third-floor flat . Still breathless from the race up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's best friend and classmate . He lived two houses away , and we had just left him . We never ate in other people 's houses unless they were our relatives . <p> Mama had moved aside , indicating that I should go in . <p> Inside , I faced the table . On the far side , fastidiously wrapped in white tissue , lay several neatly folded pieces of the mysterious white flannel . Next to them was a small duplicate of the oddshaped belt . <p> She must have seen me rummaging through her drawers . The sound of my own heart almost drowned out Frank 's first Why ? to his startling invitation . <p> " Your sister is staying home this afternoon , " she was saying . Over my fear and guilt , I felt another emotion . My face was hot . A strange rebellion propelled me around just in time to see Frank 's hurt look as he voiced his second Why ? <p> Mama 's middle voice . The command voice . " She is n't feeling well . " The signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than my fear , but not stronger than my rebellion . I listened to my brother clumping down the stairs . I felt as though our fragile unit had been sliced into three parts . <p> " I 'm not sick , " I said , but now I was n't sure . She took my arm anti led me to her chair by the window . If you looked sideways , you could see the Statue of Liberty from there , and at night , when it was dark , the partying lights of luxury liners lit up the sky . I had often seen her sitting there alone . Perhaps , looking outward , she found the same escape in the lights of a passing ship that I found , looking inward , at the lights of jewels in my pirate chest . I wished I could talk about it , but I did n't know how . Intimacies must have beginnings . Ours did not . From the past , memories of the constantly moving caretaker with no face had moved to a caretaker who could change signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . <p> She took my hand and looked embarrassed . I felt embarrassed . I said again , quieter this time , " I 'm not sick . " <p> Matter-of-factly , she said , " I saw a little blood on your pajamas this morning . Your monthly periods have begun . " <p> I did n't know what she meant , but I looked at the package on the table . She nodded and then demonstrated how to put on the strange equipment . I got up and , awkwardly , over my school uniform , mimicked her actions . She told me to go into the bathroom so that I could see what she was talking about . " Do you want me to come with you ? " <p> I said no , but when I came out , frightened and near tears , she was close by the door . We went back into the dining room . For the first time , I noticed the smell of strong beef tea and saw the cups of custard cooling by the kitchen window . I remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible thing must be something like tuberculosis . <p> Mama handed me a little calendar . She placed it on my lap , and while I watched , she marked the date with a tiny dot , then counted four weeks beyond and made a check . " About every twentyeight days , " she said . <p> " What 's twenty-eight days ? " <p> " This . " <p> " You mean this will happen again ? <p> " Every month , dear . " Mama was holding both my arms , as though to anchor me into a reality that was n't . Not my body . Not her voice . For a moment I closed my eyes . From inside , I wanted to hear the new voice , store it in a safe place , but there did n't seem to be room , and now she was speaking from outside . I opened my eyes . <p> " It happens to every woman , Eileen . It 's a beautiful thing , really . It makes it possible to have a baby " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someday . Not now . You have to get married first . " <p> " If I do n't , will this thing go away ? " <p> I saw her smile . Really smile . She said , " No . Not till you 're much older . " <p> " How old ? " <p> " Late forties , fifties , maybe . " <p> " Fifty ! " My face was hot again . " Will this happen to Frank ? " <p> " No . " Voice and eyes darkened . Neither signaled danger , but when she brought me the beef broth on a tray , she used her middle voice , the command voice . " You are not to tell Frank anything about this . Nothing . He is only a child . I 'll tell him what he needs to know . " <p> When Frank came home , a little past three , Mama had just finished instructions on how to care for the flannel . Salt . Cold water . Overnight soak . Pail under sink . Kirkmann 's Soap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you all better ? " <p> Mama 's eyes signaled . " I 'm not allowed to talk about it . " He turned to Mama . <p> " Is she going to school Monday ? " <p> " Yes . " Mama 's answer was crisp . <p> " She did n't have to go today . " <p> I could n't look at him . I picked up the Frank Merriwell I had been reading , a Frank who was tied up and buried up to his neck in the desert sand , standing upright and facing a wild beast just a few yards away . <p> Later , Mama went down to Kellbeck 's to buy milk , and Frank stole back in . " How long are you going to have this sickness you ca n't tell me about , " he demanded . <p> " Fifty years , " I said . <p> " Fifty years ! We 'll all be dead . " <p> Then over the silence he asked , <p> " If our daddy had n't died , would it be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Sin ! Who said anything about sin ? ' <p> " Well , if you 've got it , and you ca n't even tell me , then it must be a sin to tell me , and if it 's a sin to tell me , you 've got a real big one , not the kind we make up to go to confession with . " <p> Sin . Napkins . Blood . Mostly , I wanted Mama to stay away so that I could tell him . I had n't promised . But my excited brother was still talking . <p> " Donald has a real dad . Maybe I 'll ask him . " <p> Merriwell crashed to the floor , and my tears , hidden for hours like the salted flannel under the sink , flowed , I grabbed him by the shoulders . " My daddy is real , " I screamed . His lip quivered , and he ran out . <p> The next day , Saturday , I was allowed to go by myself to Woolworth 's to buy more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden cloudburst . Within seconds , visibility disappeared , and my old winter coat was soaked through into my Saturday blouse and skirt . I was within a half block of Our Lady of Angels church . One arm held the package under my coat , while the other flailed the stinging curtain until I felt the bars of the iron fence , then I stumbled my way to the entrance , up the steps , and into the silent vestibule . It was dark but dry . I pushed open the heavy red doors and stood at the back of the long middle aisle of the church . <p> The sanctuary lamp was flickering gently in the draft so that rippled images played upon the red carpel Even the still air was alive and moving . I remembered my young experience of thinking that the burning lamp was Tinker Bell making her eternal plea , all that kept her alive , " Do you believe ? " <p> The church was empty . Carefully , I let my eyes wander up and down the aisles to make sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church before . The silence was kind . I was welcome . I wanted to respond with an embrace . Wrapped only in the outside sounds of cascading water , i felt majestic . I took a few steps down the aisle , leaving footsteps on the polished floor . Mama said I could not have a baby until i was married . I saw myself in a wedding gown walking down that aisle . The image was suddenly broken by the unpleasant smell of my drenched coat . And something else . I sniffed the faint odor of my new womanhood . Frank had said " sin . " I wondered if it were a sin to walk down the church aisle without a wedding gown , leaking water from one end and , ever so faintly , blood from the other . <p> A new excitement began to overwhelm me . It was like the unexpected power in my voice yesterday when I said I was not sick . I processed slowly down the aisle toward the altar rail , looking around nervously to be sure I was alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my coat , put the package on the kneeling part of the communion rail , then draped my coat across the rail , near the votive lights , hoping for some warmth . After I removed my sandals , I walked up and down the kneeler , holding out my arms to balance , the way Frank and I used to balance on a fence . The carpet tickled my feet . They began to feel warm . Then in sheer exuberance , I leapfrogged over the altar rail and into the sanctuary . I stopped and smiled up at the sanctuary lamp . Tinker Bell had gone , and God did not strike me dead . I danced after the shadow of the flickering light as it leaped across the rich red of the rug . Nobody had ever told me that God laughed and wanted me that close . Nobody had ever told me that He loved to dance . <p> When I reached home , Frank was on the front steps , his head slumped over his fists . <p> " Why do n't you go upstairs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat beside him . " What did you do ? " <p> " Mama will kill me , " he said . <p> " Why ? " <p> " Donald 's mother came to see Mama . She just left a little while ago . " He repeated , " I 'm scared . " <p> " Me , too . " I could only guess . " You told Donald about what happened to me . " <p> In two days he had gone from best friend and companion to little brother . Now his little boy voice rose a pitch . " I did n't know what happened to you . " He was crying . I could never bear to see him cry . <p> " Is that why Mrs. Hopkins came to see Mama ? " <p> He sat up . " I was on Donald 's porch telling him about how you did n't have to go to school because you had something wrong with you that you were going to have almost forever and you could n't even tell me . " <p> I wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , " Mr. Hopkins beard us talking and he came out and Donald told him and then Mr. Hopkins asked me when Daddy died and lots of things like that . Then .. ? ' <p> " Then , then what ? " <p> " Then he told us , Donald and me , about girls , you and all girls , and he talked about us . " <p> " Us ? " <p> " Yeah , boys . Things happen to us , too . He said it was all very wonderful ? ' <p> " Mama said that , too . " I came to her defense . <p> " Then Donald 's mother came out . She gave us milk and cookies , and that 's when she said that all of this happened by accident . " <p> " It is n't an accident . It 's supposed to happen . " <p> " No . No ! " I had never seen him so agitated . " She meant me now knowing and asking Donald and Donald asking his father , and so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " As he belched out the there , he waved his arms in the direction of the Hopkinses ' house . " She said it was Mama 's right to tell me all that , and so that 's why she came to see Mama . To tell her how I got to find out . " <p> I thought of Mama 's rules about family business . <p> He was crying again . " I 'm glad you 're not really sick , but Mama must be awful mad ! " <p> I remembered Mama 's awkward tenderness in telling me what she should have told me long ago . And I thought about my horror at hearing it , not even wanting her calendar . <p> But this ? <p> " Frank , " I said , " I think we should both go in . " My laughing God was far away . <p> The too quiet flat had a wonderful aroma of beef stew . Frank 's favorite . A lemon meringue pie was on a plate from our good china . My favorite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Where was Mama ? I took Frank 's hand . We tiptoed through the small hall bedroom and into the front room . <p> We did not see her at first . She was molded into the rocking chair . It was almost dark . Multi-shades of gray clouds coaxed the lace curtains to touch my mother 's thumbs . Those thumbs were wrestling each other , playing like kittens in her hands . Except for the thumbs , she looked as though she would never move again . <p> We stood together . Stunned . After a moment , I let go of his hand . " Go to her " I said . And he did . I saw him drop onto her lap , neither caring nor watching for danger signals . Her long dry sob crunched the frozen river of my childhood like an icebreaker on the Great Bay . I did not know if the broken chunks were coming up through my throat or down between my legs . <p> For a moment , I longed to join them , but I knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the kitchen to light the light under the stew . <p> Matches were forbidden to me . But those rules were a long time ago , long before I saw that my mother had a face , and long , long before I danced with God on His own red carpet , smelling of early womanhood and a spring storm . <p> <p> By EILEEN TOBIN <p>
