<p> Josephine Millar saw her new husband go out day and night with the fire brigade into the Blitz . She gave birth during a German V-1 flying bomb attack . <p> " The nurse said ' We ca n't move you to the basement ' and I asked what I should do , and she said , ' Put your head under the pillow and pray . ' " <p> " It was a wonderful time to live , " said Mrs. Millar . <p> It was a deadly time - more than 67,000 civilians were killed in Britain during the war , most of them in bombings . But the six long years of World War II left Mrs. Millar , like many of her generation , with sharp memories of happiness , of camaraderie in the face of death , and life lived every moment . <p> For millions , in Winston Churchill 's stirring words of 1940 , it was truly " their finest hour . " <p> " During the war , there did n't seem to be any difference between people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People you would n't normally expect to be friendly with you , were . " <p> It was horrible , yes . But , " you got accustomed to it , " said her husband , David Millar , a slight , fit man of 81 . For Millar , wartime brought the challenge of dealing with the dead and the badly injured . <p> " I could do that quite easily . Some men just could n't take it . The one thing that really hurt me was when you were dealing with children , " he said . <p> One day , while driving the boss back to the station by way of Oxford Circus , " I stopped dead in the street , " Millar said . <p> Moments later , a bomb hit the big intersection . <p> " We saw it blow up right in front of our eyes . My guv'nor said , ' What made you stop ? ' and I did n't know . I still do n't know . " <p> " Someone was looking after you , " Mrs. Millar said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , " he agreed . " When I said goodbye to her in the morning , I never felt I would n't be back . " <p> While British forces were fighting famous battles in Africa , Asia and continental Europe , death came to the home front in the most mundane situations . <p> " Woolworths had got in a shipment of aluminum saucepans and a lot of women were queued up to buy them , " Millar said . <p> " A fly bomb hit them . Many of them were never found . " <p> Marjorie Wiggins , 77 , worked in a bank and did volunteer work nights and weekends at a Canadian servicemen 's club and the American Red Cross . <p> There was n't time to worry , she said . " You were always looking over your shoulder or looking ahead to find where the next meal was . " <p> With total nighttime blackouts , severe rationing and shortages of food , clothing and fuel , people developed resourcefulness into an art form . <p> " You 'd be surprised how good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in her comfortable sitting room in the English Channel port of Dover . To this day , she admitted , " I ca n't stop hoarding bits of soap . " <p> " Someone gave me an onion for a Christmas present . She 'd been to the country . I had this lovely onion wrapped up in Christmas paper . I thought it was marvelous . " <p> The war , she said , " brought the best out in people who did n't know they 'd got that best . " <p> One was Camilla Bagg , who drove a milk wagon , then joined the railways when she was 21 . With her drayhorse , George , she hauled tons of freight all over London in a wagon . <p> Reared by a Victorian great-aunt and educated at boarding school , she suddenly found herself shoulder-to-shoulder with the working class . <p> " The whole experience actually did me a power of good , " Mrs. Bagg said . " I had been brought up very genteelly , and to be chucked out into the working class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that I looked down on anybody in the yards . I would n't have dared . ... I did n't dare open my mouth because I sounded so idiotically refined . " <p> Anne Gander , one of 90,000 members of the Women 's Land Army , grew up in a crowded , working-class London neighborhood and had never had a garden . She spent 2 years as a farm laborer . <p> " I was in the Land Army with a girl who was a ballet dancer . I 'd never have met a ballet dancer where I came from , " she said . <p> " I met people who were very posh ... but they were pulling up the same potatoes as you . " <p> And harvesting potatoes was the most back-breaking job , she recalled . " When I first did that ... I was crawling at the end of the day , on my knees , crying and saying ' Be British , stop crying , be British . ' " <p> Even today , her eyes brim with tears when she remembers her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she was 14 . France had fallen to the Germans . It would be 18 months before the United States entered the war . <p> " She got hold of me and she said , ' Anne , the French have capitulated . ' And she was crying . She said , ' We 're by ourselves . ' <p> " I was so afraid , so afraid , because if my mum was afraid I 'd got good reason to be . " <p> Two weeks later , the Luftwaffe pressed a 3-to-1 advantage against the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . By late August , the Germans were sending 1,000 planes a day . <p> In September , came the Blitz , 57 nights of heavy bombing in London that killed more than 14,000 people , destroyed docks and munitions , and shattered thousands of homes . The bombers returned intermittently until May . <p> Harry Errington was a 29-year-old cutter for a London tailor when he joined the fire brigade . On the night of Sept. 17 , 1940 , a bomb scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine other firemen and 20 civilians slept on the basement floor . <p> The garage collapsed in flames . Errington , blown across the basement , was escaping when he heard a scream and turned back . He dug two men out of the burning rubble , losing the skin off his hands , and got them out of the gasoline-fueled inferno . <p> " I was lucky , " he said , minimizing his own heroism . <p> He is sitting in a cafe across from his apartment and about 200 yards from the scene of the fire ; when the war was over , he went back to tailoring and now , at 84 , is considering retirement . <p> The night he got home from the hospital , the whole family slept in the basement as a precaution . " Luckily , we did , " he said , because a bomb hit the building . The family spent the rest of the night sleeping at Goodge Street Underground station , just down the road . <p> A slightly built man in an impeccably cut suit , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo taken the day he went to Buckingham Palace and King George VI pinned on his George Cross , the highest award for gallantry a civilian can win . <p> " You had a job to do , you were trained to do it . And if you concentrated on doing the job , there was no fear , " he said . <p> Doreen Webster spent part of her time during the war rescuing bomb victims . <p> " We saw some horrible things . But also some good things , " she said . " We had terrible times , but we had fun . We did . "
