<p> Louis Gerstner , IBM 's CEO , is not simply trying to buy Lotus Development . He 's trying to run away with the next era of computing . <p> Monday , IBM offered $ 3.3 billion for Lotus , the legendary software company that helped build the personal computer industry by creating the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program in the early 1980s . <p> These days , Lotus ' hit product is Notes . It lets people communicate and share information via their PCs whether across an office or an ocean . No other software comes close to Notes ' ability to link PC users . To Gerstner , Notes combined with IBM 's computers and global marketing can help make IBM the leader in creating networks of computers , perhaps the hottest computer market of the next decade . <p> " This is a perfect marriage , " says Sam Albert , an independent IBM industry analyst and former IBM employee . Other analysts are n't so sure . Noting that both IBM and Lotus have stumbled the past few years , David Rothschild , analyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " the mediocre acquiring the weak . " <p> Either way , the marriage may be of the shotgun variety . Lotus on Monday did not give in to IBM 's hostile bid , though the $ 60 a share offer was almost double Friday 's closing price . Lotus stock closed Monday at $ 61 , up 28 . IBM fell 2 5/8 to $ 91 1/4 . Gerstner says IBM , which has more than $ 10 billion in cash , has courted Lotus for five months . Frustrated , Gerstner launched the offer to try to coerce Lotus CEO Jim Manzi . " The steps we 've taken today are aimed at getting a negotiated settlement , " Gerstner says . <p> Most analysts expect financially-strapped Lotus to give in . " If Lotus were smart , it would cash out now , " says Tim Bajarin , president of Creative Strategies . Yet competing bidders may surface . " You could easily justify a higher price , especially if you think the Notes business will accelerate , " says Dave Smith , vice president at Keystone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thinks the company could fetch up to $ 70 a share , and says Oracle , Hewlett-Packard or AT &T; could bid . <p> Lotus says it is reviewing IBM 's offer . <p> To explain why IBM wants Lotus so badly , Gerstner offers a history lesson . In the 1970s , computers were centralized - one big mainframe computer ran hundreds of " dumb " terminals . People working at terminals could communicate only by routing information through the mainframe . In the 1980s , computers became decentralized as PCs popped up on desks . Each could do its own computing , but a worker at a PC had a hard time sharing information with a worker at another PC . <p> " Now we 're entering a new phase , " says Gerstner , who has Lotus Notes on the PC at his desk . " It 's a phase in which all of the computing power in an enterprise is linked together . " PCs will talk to each other and also talk to mainframes or any other kind of computer . Workers anywhere in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a budget together or exchange electronic mail . Gerstner calls it team computing . Companies such as AT &T; and Hewlett-Packard are going after the market , too . <p> To get into the team computing business , IBM needs to make a leap . The company 's computer business is rooted in two eras past - in the mainframe and minicomputer business . Such high-end machines still account for around 68% of IBM 's net income . The company faltered in the PC era , ultimately suffering a $ 5 billion net loss in 1992 and an $ 8.1 billion net loss in 1993 before bouncing back to a gain of $ 3 billion last year . <p> Gerstner is trying to push all IBM 's resources toward team computing . He wants mainframes and minicomputers to act as servers that shuttle information out to PCs and other computers on a network . He wants IBM PCs to be the outposts on the network . He even has IBM building its own high-speed , worldwide computer network , so big IBM customers can use it to connect far-flung sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a hard sell within IBM 's bureaucratic culture , but Gerstner says he 's taking the plunge . <p> Notes would help a lot . The revolutionary software , often called groupware , makes team computing possible . It 's used on 1.6 million PCs at thousands of companies . That 's up from 700,000 users a year and a half ago . At a recent speech before customers in Orlando , Fla. , Lotus ' Manzi said that if growth rates continue to rise , he would n't be surprised if Notes were installed on 20 million PCs over the next several years . <p> No other software can match Notes , the first software of its kind . It was unveiled in 1989 but only took off the past two years . Collabra sells a product for smaller networks . Novell sells a Notes-like product called GroupWise . As for mighty Microsoft , its product , called Exchange , has been delayed . Most experts say it will likely be out next year . <p> Gerstner smells opportunity . Not only could Notes help IBM , but IBM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers , putting Notes far ahead of competitors . " They ( Microsoft ) are investing a lot . But I do n't think they 're anywhere near as far along as a combined Lotus and IBM team . There is an opportunity for leadership here . " Gerstner adds : " Notes would be the focal point of all our groupware within IBM . " <p> Yet there could be problems . IBM would be buying a limping company . While Notes has sold well , sales of Lotus ' other core products - such as the Ami Pro word processor , its 1-2-3 spreadsheet and its Freelance Graphics presentation software - declined 20% in 1994 . Lotus , a powerhouse in the mid-1980s , has been losing to Microsoft and lately to Novell/WordPerfect . The company lost $ 17.5 million the first quarter of 1995 and saw revenue shrink 18% vs. the same period in 1994 . <p> IBM , for its part , has proven to be a lousy PC software marketer . Its PC operating system , OS/2 , is roundly praised for being much better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dent in the market . Some analysts believe buying Lotus might help OS/2 . Lotus makes applications software to run on OS/2 , so IBM could package Lotus products with the operating system to give OS/2 a boost . <p> Then there 's the concern that gigantic IBM might squash the culture at Lotus , which had $ 971 million in revenue in 1994 . IBM has n't bought a good-size company since picking up phone company Rolm in a 1984 deal . IBM did n't quite know what to do with the fast-moving , entrepreneurial company - and eventually sold it . History might repeat itself with Lotus , some analysts say . A fear of losing independence may be the reason Manzi has n't agreed to join IBM . <p> Gerstner pledges that IBM would leave Lotus alone , keeping top management and the company 's Cambridge , Mass. , headquarters . <p> And anyway , some argue that IBM 's move to take over Lotus shows that IBM may really be changing . " This is the new IBM , " analyst Albert says . " The company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't give us ( Notes ) , we 'll take it anyway . It 's a bold step . " Contributing : James Kim , Patrick McGeehan <p> IBM gets most of its income from computer heardware . By buying Lotus , IBM would make a big move into the PC software business : <p> IBM 's 1994 revenues : Hardware sales 50.5% Software 17.7% Services 15.2% Maintenance 11.3% Rentals &; financing 5.3% Communications software , including e-mail and other programs , is a $ 920 million-a-year business . Lotus , maker of Notes , is a leader in the field . <p> Communications software market share : Other vendors 48% Lotus Development 34% Microsoft 12% Novell/Wordperfect 6%
