She 's just dying to see you , so excited , and you really ca n't refuse a ninety-two-year-old , said Miles Henry to his old friend Grace Lafferty , the famous actress , who was just passing through town , a very quick visit . Miles and Grace were getting on , too , but they were nowhere near the awesome age of ninety-two , the age of Miss Louise Dabney , she who was so very anxious to see Grace , " if only for a minute , over tea . " <p> " I really do n't remember her awfully well , " Grace told Miles . " She was very pretty ? But all Mother 's friends were pretty . Which made her look even worse . Miles , do we really have to come for tea ? " <p> " You really do . " He laughed , as she had laughed , but they both understood what was meant . She and the friend whom she had brought along  --  Jonathan Hedding , a lawyer , retired , very tall , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tea . As payment , really , for how well Miles had managed their visit : no parties , no pictures or interviews . He had been wonderfully firm , and since he and Grace had been friends forever , if somewhat mysteriously , it was conceded that he had a right to take charge . No one in town would have thought of challenging Miles ; for one thing , he was too elusive . <p> The town was a fairly small one , in the Georgia hill country , not far from Atlanta  --  and almost everyone there was somewhat excited , interested in this visit ; those who were not were simply too young to know who Grace Lafferty was , although their parents had told them : the very famous Broadway actress , then movie star , then occasional TV parts . Grace , who had been born and raised in this town but had barely been back at all . Just briefly , twice , for the funerals of her parents , and one other time when a movie was opening in Atlanta . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing to do with publicity or promotions ; according to Miles , she just wanted to see it all again , and she had carefully picked this season , April , the first weeks of spring , as being the most beautiful that she remembered . Anywhere . <p> It was odd how she and Miles had stayed friends all these years . One rumor held that they had been lovers very long ago , in the time of Grace 's turbulent girlhood , before she got so beautiful ( dyed her hair blond ) and famous . Miles had been studying architecture in Atlanta then , and certainly they had known each other , but the exact nature of their connection was a mystery , and Miles was far too old-time gentlemanly for anyone to ask . Any more than they would have asked about his two marriages , when he was living up north , and his daughter , whom he never seemed to see . <p> If Grace 's later life from a distance had seemed blessed with fortune ( although , four marriages , no children ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not ; her parents , both of them , were difficult . Her father , a classic beau of his time , was handsome , and drank too much , and chased girls . Her mother , later also given to drink , was smart and snobbish ( she was from South Carolina , and considered Georgia a considerable comedown ) . She tended to say exactly what she thought , and she was n't one bit pretty . Neither one of them seemed like ordinary parents , a fact they made a point of  --  of being above and beyond most normal parental concerns , of not acting like " parents . " " We appreciate Grace as a person , and not JUST because she 's our daughter , " Hortense , the mother , was fairly often heard to say , which may have accounted for the fact that Grace was a rather unchildlike child : precocious , impertinent , too smart for her own good . Rebellious , always . Unfairly , probably , no one cared a lot for poor , wronged Hortense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women in town had real big , serious crushes on him . <p> Certainly they made a striking threesome , tall Grace and those two tall men , during the short days of her visit , as they walked slowly , with a certain majesty , around the town . Grace 's new friend , or whatever he was , Jonathan Hedding , the lawyer , was the tallest , with heavy , thick gray hair , worn a trifle long for these parts but still , enviably all his own . Miles and Grace were almost the exact same height , she in those heels she always wore , and , in the new spring sunlight , their hair seemed about the same color , his shining white , hers the palest blond . Grace wore the largest dark glasses that anyone had ever seen  --  in that way only did she look like a movie star ; that and the hair ; otherwise she was just tall and a little plump , and a good fifteen years older than she looked to be . <p> Several times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " But was there something particular you wanted to see ? I could take you  --  " <p> " Oh no . " Her throaty voice hesitated . " Oh no , I just wanted to see  --  everything . The way we 're doing . And of course I wanted Jon to see it , too . " <p> Miles asked her , " How about the cemetery ? These days I know more people there than I do downtown . " <p> She laughed , but she told him , " Oh , great . Let 's do go and see the cemetery . " <p> Certainly Grace had been right about the season . The dogwood was just in bloom , white fountains spraying out against the darker evergreens , and fragrant white or lavender wisteria , across the roofs of porches , over garden trellises . Jonquils and narcissus , in their tidy plots , bricked off from the flowing lawns . As Grace several times remarked , the air simply smelled of April . There was nothing like it , anywhere . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm not sure I could stand it . " She laughed , very lightly . <p> The cemetery was old , pre-Civil War ; many of the stones were broken , worn , the inscriptions illegible . But there were new ones , too , that both Grace and Miles recognized , and remarked upon . <p> " Look at those Sloanes , they were always the tackiest people . Oh , the Berryhills , they must have struck it rich . And the Calvins , discreet and tasteful as always . Lord , how could there be so many Strouds ? " <p> It was Jonathan who finally said , " Now i see the point of cemeteries . Future entertainment . " <p> They all laughed . It was perhaps the high point of their afternoon , the moment at which they all liked each other best . <p> And then Grace pointed ahead of them , and she said , " Well , for God 's sake , there they are . Why did I think I could miss them , totally ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more discreet lettering , Hortense and Thomas . With dates . <p> Grace shuddered . " Well , they wo n't get me in there . Not with them . I 'm going to be cremated and have the ashes scattered off Malibu . Or maybe in Central Park . " <p> Five o'clock . Already they were a little late . It was time to go for tea , or rather to be there . Grace had taken even longer than usual with makeup , with general fussing , though Jonathan had reminded her , " At ninety-two she may not see too well , you know . " <p> " Nevertheless . " But she had n't laughed . <p> Miles lived in a small house just across the street from Miss Dabney 's much larger , grander house . It was thus that they knew each other . As Grace and Jonathan drove up , he was out in front poking at leaves , but actually just waiting for them , as they all knew . <p> " I 'm sorry  --  " Grace began . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so nerved up ? " <p> " Oh , I do n't know  --  " <p> Inside Miss Dabney 's entrance hall , to which they had been admitted by a white-aproned , very small black woman , where they were told to wait , Jonathan tried to exchange a complicitous look with Grace : after all , she was with him . But she seemed abstracted , apart . <p> The parlor into which they were at last led by the same small , silent maid was predictably crowded  --  with tiny tables and chairs , with silver frames and photographs , love seats and glassed-n bookcases . And , in the center of it all , Miss Dabney herself , yellowed white hair swathed about her head like a bandage , but held up stiff and high , as though the heavy pearl choker that she wore were a splint . Her eyes , shining out through folds of flesh , were tiny and black , and brilliant . She held out a gnarled , much-jeweled hand to Grace . ( Was Grace supposed to kiss the rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . <p> When Miss Dabney spoke , her voice was amazingly clear , rather high , a little hoarse but distinct . " Grace Lafferty , you do look absolutely lovely , " she said . " I 'd know you anywhere , in a way you have n't changed a bit . " <p> " Oh , well , but you looks " Grace started to say . <p> " Now , now , I 'm much too old to be flattered . That 's how come I do n't have handsome men around me anymore . " Her glance flicked out to take in Miles , and then Jonathan . " But of course no man was ever as handsome as your daddy . " <p> " No , I guess  --  " <p> " Too bad your mother was n't pretty , too . I think it would have improved her character " <p> " Probably  --  " <p> Miss Dabney leaned forward . " You know , we 've always been so proud of you in this town . Just as proud as proud . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something within her settled down , some set of nerves , perhaps . She almost relaxed . Miles with relief observed this , and Jonathan , too . <p> " Yes , indeed we have . For so many , many things , " Miss Dabney continued . <p> A warm and pleasant small moment ensued , during which in an almost preening way , Grace glanced at Jonathan  --  before Miss Dabney took it up again . <p> " But do you know what you did that made us the very proudest of all ? " Quite apparently wanting no answer , had one been possible , she seemed to savor the expectation her non-question had aroused . <p> " It was many , many years ago , and your parents were giving a dinner party , " she began  --  as Miles thought , Oh dear God , oh Jesus . <p> " And you were just this adorable little two- or three-year-old . And somehow you got out of your crib and you came downstairs , and you crawled right under the big white linen tablecloth , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you bit your mother right there on the ankle . Good and hard ! She jumped and cried out , and Buck lifted up the tablecloth , and there you were . I do n't remember quite how they punished you , but we all just laughed and laughed . Hortense was not the most popular lady in town , and I reckon one time or another we 'd all had an urge to bite her . And you did it ! We were all just so proud ! " <p> " But  --  " Grace protested , or rather , she began to protest . She seemed then , though , to remember certain rules . One held that Southern ladies do not contradict other ladies , especially if the other one is very old . She also remembered a rule from her training as an actress : you do not exhibit uncontrolled emotion of your own . <p> Grace simply said , " It 's funny , I do n't remember that at all , " and she smiled , beautifully . <p> Miles , though , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always loved her , for the first time fully understood just what led her to become an actress , and also why she was so very good at what she did . <p> " Well , of course you do n't , " Miss Dabney was saying . " You were much too young . But it 's a wonder no one ever told you , considering how famous  --  how famous that story was . " <p> Jonathan , who felt that Grace was really too old for him , but whose tame he had enjoyed , up to a point , now told Miss Dabney , " It 's a marvelous story . You really should write it , I think . Some magazine  --  " <p> Grace gave him the smallest but most decisive frown  --  as Miles , watching , thought , Oh , good . <p> And Grace now said , abandoning all rules , " I guess up to now no one ever told me so as not to make me feel small and had . I guess they knew I 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was . funny " <p> As Miles thought , Ah , that 's my girl ! <p> <p> By ALICE ADAMS <p>
