<p> HE last thing Virginia Lewis remembers before her husband put a gun to her head was drinking a glass of iced tea . <p> She was standing on a ladder painting when her husband , Mike , offered her the drugged drink . " All of a sudden I lost all muscle control and begged him to take me to the hospital , " Lewis recalled . Mike shuttled their two kids to the neighbor 's house and guided Lewis into the car . <p> But this was n't an emergency run to the hospital . This was an abduction . The couple lived in Las Vegas and through her haze , Lewis realized they were speeding toward Utah . <p> Mike steered the car off the interstate and headed down an isolated road . He yanked Lewis out of the car and threatened her with a knife , a gun and a rope . <p> " He held the knife to my throat and told me he was going to kill me , " Lewis said . " He said if he could n't have me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what she knew he wanted to hear . " ' My poor baby , ' I said , ' I wo n't leave you . We can make it work . Throw the gun away . " ' <p> After more pleading , Mike loosened the bullet chamber from the gun and hurled it into the desert . He snapped out of his murderous trance and broke down sobbing . Lewis , who had kept up the nonstop dialogue , glanced down at her body . <p> She was covered in blood . <p> " The whole time I was talking , Mike had been waving that knife in front of me , " Lewis recalled . " The knife cut me and I did n't even feel it . " The blood pumped from an artery near her elbow . Mike wrapped the wound with a T-shirt and this time drove Lewis to the emergency room . <p> " As soon as I got inside the emergency room , I told them to call the police and the staff psychiatrist , this man just tried to kill me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be apprehended . <p> A police officer persuaded her not to press charges . " Is there anyone who will bail him out ? " the officer asked Lewis . " His mother , " she said . " Lady , he 'll come back and finish you off . " <p> Lewis told the story of her first marriage over lunch <p> at the Brown Palace . Her silk tank top nearly matched the color of her tanned skin . Dark-blond hair feathered around her face , softening her sharp features . Lewis discussed the details of that horrible ordeal and the months of visitation hearings over their two children without tears , anger or bitterness . <p> She simply married the wrong guy . <p> Since then , Lewis , 41 , has parlayed her life into a $ 40 million empire . Success is the best revenge . The owner of the Gold Mine and Jazz Alley casinos in Black Hawk is one of the wealthiest women in Colorado , in her own right . Lewis is a recovering workaholic who has taken every hand life has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a gambler . <p> Lewis was a straight-A student in high school who was headed for college , but meeting and marrying Mike when she was 16 derailed those plans . She quit school and went to work at a Burger King in Henderson , Nev. , after Mike lost his job . When Lewis was pregnant with her son , Michael , the Burger King manager moved her from the front counter to the back room where she learned inventory , bookkeeping , purchasing and scheduling . <p> The day she went into labor , she called in sick . Three days after her son 's birth , Lewis was back at work . She had to work because Mike could n't keep a job . She finally persuaded Mike to join the Air Force . The abuse started when she was six months pregnant . Mike shoved her behind a heating vent where she remained stuck for hours . <p> " I 'd threaten to leave and he 'd get a job , " she said . <p> Lewis ' second child , Jennifer , was born with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a result of a serious car accident where she was broadsided and her pregnant stomach smashed by the seat belt . Or it could have been the X-ray for a kidney infection before Lewis suspected she was pregnant . <p> The birth defect meant Jennifer would need a lifetime of special care . Jennifer 's parents finally split up when she was 4 and her brother was 6 . Michael is still haunted by the memory of his rage-filled father pulling the telephone out of the wall and beating his mom over the head with the receiver . <p> A CROWD of about 1,000 people fell silent while Lewis told her story . They had gathered over lunch at the downtown Marriott Hotel to honor her as the 1994 Outstanding Business Woman of the Year , an award sponsored by the Colorado Women 's Chamber of Commerce . <p> Her voice broke and she gripped the podium to regain her composure . In a tearful speech , Lewis recalled her childhood , growing up as one of 11 children who now range in age from 34 to 53 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father chased after work . For a time , he ran a TV repair business and set up the kids as tube testers in his shop . Her mother , meanwhile , fixed up every rundown house the family lived in . " She 'd say to us , ' Pick out the color of paint you want and paint your own room . " ' <p> Lewis ' mom had a knack for talking her way into living in a ramshackle house nearly rent-free in exchange for repairs and redecorating . The children pitched in with cleaning , sanding floors , patching holes in walls , making curtains , planting gardens and painting . Those skills her mother taught her would serve Lewis well in later years . <p> Lewis ' dad , Cecil Stuck , suffered from chronic sinus problems that required frequent trips from Oklahoma back to the dry Nevada desert . By the time Lewis left home , her dad had joined the electrical union and landed a job on the lighting crew of Wayne Newton 's show . <p> " He tripled his salary , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities , fishing for food and growing vegetables in their own garden . The younger Lewis kids enjoyed the benefits of their father 's comfortable salary . <p> Lewis 's father died of a heart attack at age 52 . He was a heavy smoker , going through two to three packs a day of unfiltered Chesterfields . <p> Lewis has stayed close to her seven sisters , but says she 's closest to Ruth , who was old enough to help raise Lewis , and Margie , the next sibling in line after Virginia . <p> " My best memory growing up was the time we lived next to a junk car lot , " Lewis said . " There were some old cars from the ' 40s with rounded hoods . We 'd take those hoods and make boats out of them and float down the creek . " <p> At age 21 and divorced , Lewis kept her family afloat by working nights as a camera girl in the casino of the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas where she made $ 100 or more a night . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then enrolled in the local community college . With a bank loan of $ 20,000 , Lewis bought her first house - a fixer-upper . <p> " I 'd bring the kids with me and they 'd work on the yard , " she said . " Michael and I put in a sprinkler system . I read pamphlets on wall paper and plumbing . " <p> Lewis netted $ 6,000 on the sale of that first house and continued to make money buying , repairing and selling roughly 15 rundown homes . At one point , she owned seven houses . " I do n't know what came over me , " she said , laughing . " I wanted to open a restaurant . " <p> She also wanted to take her children out of Nevada , which she describes as " a tough place to raise kids . " She quit her job , sold the houses and opened Walter Mitty 's restaurant in Oklahoma , named for the fictional character who lived in daydreams . <p> Her sister , Margie , helped run the restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Franklin stove , created the menu and sewed the tablecloths and napkins . The sister-restaurateurs worked too hard for two years until a kitchen fire put an end to Walter Mitty 's . After the fire , Lewis could n't get insurance on the restaurant and was forced to close . <p> " The new mall wanted me to go in there , but I was disgusted with working all the time , " Lewis said . " I hardly even saw my kids , and I was n't getting rich . " <p> Most of her family had moved back to Nevada , so Lewis packed up her kids and moved to Mount Charleston , a mountain town 30 miles outside of Las Vegas . That 's where she met and married her second husband , Jim Lewis . <p> JENNIFER followed her mother up five flights of stairs at the Weld County courthouse . They were on their way to an annual meeting with a judge regarding Lewis ' guardianship of her daughter . <p> Jennifer , in a bright yellow suit , and Lewis , wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were heading for an island vacation instead of facing a judge . <p> Jennifer was nervous . She had gone way over her annual budget and there would be some explaining to do . <p> Lewis first sent her daughter away to boarding school when Jennifer was 13 . " She had all these dreams of being a cheerleader and making the swimming team and there was no way that was going to happen , " Lewis said . <p> After searching the country for the right school , Jennifer fell in love with Maple Brook in New York state . The students had in common some form of cerebral palsy , and Jennifer shone in that setting . <p> " She became a cheerleader , made the swim team and competed in skiing , " Lewis said . " She got up to her full potential . " <p> At 18 , Jennifer graduated from Maple Brook and Lewis faced the difficult task of finding a permanent home for her daughter . Once again , the duo scoured the country for the right place , and they found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeley . <p> But there was no room at the ranch , so Lewis and Jim bought a house on the property for their daughter . Jennifer and her roommate are the only two " ranchers " who live in and take care of their own home . <p> Jennifer attends Ames Community College and would like a career in child care . During summer break , she earns money washing dishes at a restaurant in town or working for her mom in the casinos . She 's also a competitive skier in the Special Olympics . <p> When Lewis dies , Jennifer will be well provided for . Lewis ' entire estate - estimated to be currently worth $ 40 million - goes to Jennifer . <p> Because of her struggle , Lewis is adamant that her son will earn his own way in the world . " There will be no trust-fund babies in my family , " Lewis says , her voice rising . " I 've seen too many families ruined by it . They think the world owes them a living . I told Michael , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me know what you want me to invest in today . ' I 'm fortunate with my success . He can pick what he wants to do , but he ca n't live off a trust fund . " <p> Michael has inherited his mother 's head for business and last year opened Beach Express , a clothing store in Westminster . Lewis backed the venture and will help her son open more outlets , when the time <p> comes . <p> " One of my regrets is that I did n't spend more time with my children when they were growing up , " Lewis said . " When I was younger I had to support us . They 're good people , what more can I say ? " <p> ' LOOSEN those machines for us , wo n't you Virginia ? " a senior citizen ribbed the casino owner as she boarded the shuttle bus that ferries visitors between the Gold Mine and Jazz Alley casinos . " I 'll buy you lunch at Gold Mine , " Lewis offered . " Will that make up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold Mine casino on Oct. 1 , 1991 , the first day that gaming was allowed in Colorado . The couple gambled on Black Hawk over the more popular Central City , and Lewis said the gamble has paid off . <p> " There 's a lot to be said for being the only game in town , " said Lewis , who enjoyed operating Black Hawk 's only casino for three months . " We opened at 10 a.m. on opening day and they started lining up at 8 . " <p> Gold Mine has lived up to its name since the first coin dropped into the first slot machine . Jazz Alley has had a harder time showing a profit . Lewis was a lender for Jazz Alley 's original owners , but they wanted out of the deal after two weeks in business . Lewis bought them out and took over a losing business . <p> " When I first took over , this place was losing $ 130,000 a month , but I felt like it was a good project , " Lewis said . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casino into a money-making operation . At the worst of times , the slots were only making $ 17 a day . The business broke even in late 1993 . <p> " We 've been slowly climbing since then . " <p> Lewis believes in Jazz Alley 's future and is proving her faith by buying property next to the casino so she can double its size by fall of 1996 . <p> A giant sunflower clip caught her blond ponytail as Lewis breezed through the casino , stopping to chat with employees and greet guests . Treating employees well is one of Lewis ' hallmarks . <p> " I think they know I care about their personal lives . They can talk to me whether it 's about work or home . When you 're dealing with the service business , if you have good personnel you can teach the paperwork . It 's more important to me to have good people . " <p> Lewis wants to purchase property in Golden where she will offer a day-care company free rent in exchange for discounted day care for her employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day-care summer program , bought a computer and a baseball pitching machine for one of the schools , and replaced money that was stolen from the high school pancake breakfast . When the Gilpin County Chamber of Commerce faced closure because of lack of funds , Lewis kicked in the bucks to pay staff salaries . <p> " I 've been fortunate , but I 've been in the position to be needy , " Lewis said . " I could have been broke . I feel it 's important to give back to the community . " <p> Virginia and Jim Lewis divorced after 11 years of marriage . They built a business together , but the marriage did n't survive the stress . Lewis calls Jim a dreamer . He had the vision to negotiate a lease with the Flandreau Santee Sioux in Flandreau , S.D. , where the Lewises became the nation 's first casino owners under the U.S. Indian Gaming Act . <p> They bought a building on the Santee Sioux reservation and opened the Royal River Casino on Oct. 1 , 1990 . Less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to renegotiate their contract and the Lewises eventually sold out to a third party . Lewis says Jim never fully recovered from the loss of the casino . <p> " He was devastated from the South Dakota experience . I thought I was burned out , too , but I started having fun with Gold Mine . " She hired a few key people from the South Dakota casino and set about the arduous task of tearing down the existing Conoco gas station and building the Gold Mine in 40 days . <p> " Jim never felt a part of this , " Lewis said , gesturing toward the Gold Mine 's ever jangling slot machines . " We were always more like business partners than a married couple . We did n't spend time together because I worked all the time . You do that for 11 years and you do n't know each other . " <p> JOHN Paul Strate , Lewis ' handsome young boyfriend , greeted her at the door of their Cherry Creek North townhouse with a bouquet of flowers . There was no special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who first hired him as her chauffeur . <p> Lewis used to travel to Black Hawk driven by Strate in a 1988 Lincoln Town Car with a cellular phone and swivel desk top for her lap-top computer . " I felt pretentious with a chauffeur , " she said , " so when I was through with work , I started sitting in front with him . " <p> When she started driving herself to the casinos in her Jeep Grand Cherokee , Lewis missed the young man who had become her " buddy " over two years . " Six months later , we started dating . " <p> Strate is 14 years younger than Lewis and three years older than her son . They both say the age difference is n't an issue - except when they go out in public and attract some curious glances . <p> " When I worked in Las Vegas I used to think , ' Is n't that nice that he ( a customer ) brought his daughter to Las Vegas . ' Now I 'm thinking I 'm going to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the help of a decorator , picked out every piece of furniture in their well-appointed townhouse . Furnishings are a tasteful mix of pieces they 've collected while traveling and furniture they bought locally . Paintings and sculptures have a decidedly Greek influence , befitting Strate 's heritage . <p> When the twosome met , they were each going through a difficult period . Lewis was embroiled in her divorce from Jim . Strate 's best friend had died in a car accident . After being turned down for admission to law school , Strate decided to take a break and work in the casinos . <p> " When I first saw her , I thought , ' That 's the kind of woman I want , " ' Strate said , beaming at Lewis as she prepared salmon in pepper crust for dinner . They make a point of dining together each evening ; Lewis calls cooking her therapy . " God answered my prayers with her . Her caring , kindness and giving attracted me . We 're both individuals that love to get things done . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspires to be a clothing manufacturer . He 's designed a line of what he calls " motivational sportswear " under the label Damn Strate . <p> " We 're headed in the direction of getting married and having kids , " Strate said candidly . He shot Virginia - he calls her V - a loving smile . " V was my savior . It became crystal clear that by knowing her I could accomplish anything . " <p> Lewis sees her future with Strate and a child with whom she will be able to spend time . She 'd also like to diversify into Denver-area restaurants and the entertainment field . Perhaps someday she 'll even open a small casino in Las Vegas , she said . <p> " You have choices in life and I choose not to be unhappy . " <p> Penny Parker is a Denver Post staff writer .
