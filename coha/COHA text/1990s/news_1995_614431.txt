<p> In the beginning came the Federal League , the first serious renegade faction to break off from the majors . It was a pox upon the 1914 game , would drain talent , splinter fans allegiances and spoil baseball as America knew it . Except none of that happened . By 1922 , it was gone , leaving behind only a pile of litigation that gave major league baseball its current antitrust exemption . <p> Ever since , this game has undergone similar periodic crises that were destined to ruin it . The rabbit ball . Cocaine . Expansion . The dead ball . The CBS/ESPN $ 1.46 billion TV contract . Marvin Miller . Polyester . The player strike . The owner lockout . Free agency . Bill Veeck . All of these hardships visited baseball ( some never left ) to dire predictions of the consequences . <p> None ruined baseball . But each , subtly or otherwise , changed it . <p> What players and owners found this month when they emerged from their foxholes is a game changed once again . The eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some contractual chaos for players , financial anxiety for owners and horrendous public relations with the public , just like every other work stoppage . <p> " Can you apologize to the fans ? No , words are hollow , " said Toronto Blue Jays president Paul Beeson . " We 're giving consideration to doing things different . We owe it to the fans . Did we make new fans through all of this ? No . Did we lose fans ? Yes . " <p> And so , the game is returned to a suspicious public . Without a basic work agreement , without plans to negotiate , without a no-strike pledge , the players officially complete the longest offseason in history Tuesday night , when the Los Angeles Dodgers play at Florida . The game is pledging it will make things right with the people , who have little reason to believe it . <p> " We came very close to letting this game fall apart , " said Milwaukee third baseman Kevin Seitzer . " Without that injunction ( to end the strike ) , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for eight months for them to bargain . I think both of us lost . " <p> The Great Strike of 1994-95 was probably inevitable , for the baseball business had been cruising for a bruising for 20 years . With players ( and their agents ) fascinated by how far payrolls can be stretched , with club owners astounded by a fluctuating profit margin , the game has sought but found little common ground between clubhouse and front office . <p> Still gauging the damages <p> The strike only accelerated erosion . As small-market clubs have sold off their assets , the big-market clubs have scrambled to sign up the stars . Braves owner Ted Turner chuckled after the Marquis Grissom deal that his club is " the first team to win the World Series in April . " <p> Said Cleveland Indians GM John Hart , " This has been a serious blood bath . " <p> And it is hardly over . The players could well strike again before the next World Series , though it 's unlikely . Players and owners could negotiate a work agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though that 's more unlikely still . All that remains certain this week is that for a while at least , the gates are open . Other than that , Los Angeles Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley said , " The damage and destruction will be greater than anyone realizes . " <p> What the game seeks to control first is its economic growth , perhaps an odd objective for a business that just approved expansion in the midst of the worst labor disaster in history . But just like the banking , airline and other industries that have had to regroup , baseball went through fantastic changes during the 1980s that were not all healthy . Franchise value has sky-rocketed . Even a destitute club like the Pittsburgh Pirates , worth $ 20 million 10 years ago , is now for sale for over $ 90 million . Hand in hand , player salaries zoomed beyond all expectation . In 1976 , owners paid players an average wage of $ 52,300 . Last year , that average was $ 1.15 million . <p> Though this might have become a great symbiotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its work relationship - baseball 's labor past has been so tinged by decades of bad blood that the negotiating of any new basic work agreement almost guarantees a strike or lockout . <p> Much of that stems from the old relationships among the clubs . Owners distrusted other owners . GMs distrusted GMs . Players distrusted anyone in a suit . Agents arrived to fuel the fire , sometimes even setting player against player in the great money chase . It is against this backdrop that the 1994-95 strike was possible , pitting the billionaire against the millionaire , ownership pleading hardship , players pleading fairness , the negotiating room often reduced to shouting . <p> Strike over , but nothing settled <p> In other industries , this process might be called a market correction , the warring factions forced to wrestle with a future their business had not foreseen . But Federal Judge Sonia Sotomayor essentially elimininated that chance , ruling March 31 that ownership had acted too hastily in trying to implement its own work agreement . The ruling led to the end of the strike and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid before the strike ended , ownership 's fundamental wish to contain the growth of payrolls has gone unaddressed . Labor 's wish to maintain an open market has not been resolved . Issues of revenue sharing and luxury taxes are dormant . The sides still have no new work agreement , nor have plans to discuss one . <p> Said Atlanta Braves general manager John Schuerholz , " It was like some took a yellow highlighter and ran it over the problem . " <p> Certainly , the public has long since grown unamused . Though players reported back to camps vowing a new appreciation for the game and their jobs , the image of the overpaid dilettante is a hard one to shake . The game 's biggest winter story concerned the failed careers of Doc Gooden and Darryl Strawberry , who once had all New York City laid out at their feet . Strawberry will go to jail for income tax evasion while Gooden serves a drug suspension . <p> And certainly player images were not improved by the strike coverage itself , Atlanta 's Tom Glavine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleading the injustices of a millionaire 's plight . <p> " I 'm like this - you like me or you do n't , " said San Francisco 's Barry Bonds upon arriving at the Giants ' camp . " That 's me . What are you going to do , blame me ? They 're saying , ' Kiss butt now . ' That 's not going to change anything . It 's over with . We can all move on together , or we can dwell in the past . Let 's start over and all make it better - players and fans and media and ownership . " <p> Hardly contrition , but there is a disappointment in the clubhouse , too . When a reporter came upon Minnesota 's Kirby Puckett filling out forms for a recent $ 83 million Florida lottery , the beloved Twin said , " If I win , I 'm going to retire . " And Puckett is one who loves the game . <p> The dismantling of the Expos <p> After acting commissioner Bud Selig 's " delight " in announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger within the clubs over how business has been conducted this month as post-strike finances take form . Though long skeptical of ownership 's pleas for monetary relief , even union hard-liners are bewildered by high-price player movement as low-budget teams jettison contracts . <p> " We lost between $ 20 and $ 25 million in cash last year , and we would have soared well above that if we kept the same team we had last year , " said Kansas City Royals general manager Herk Robinson , who sliced nearly $ 10 million from his payroll when he traded center fielder Brian McRae and Cy Young winner Cone . " Simply put , our losses would have been staggering this year if we did n't make these deals . With an increased payroll and reduced revenues , our losses would grow . We know our revenues will be lower this year because of the strike . " <p> " The fat-cat teams have the chance to get fatter , and others are moving people out at a fire-sale rate , " California Angels general ganager Bill Bavasi said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete fire- sale club , but we 're only a hair-breadth away . " <p> What the Montreal Expos did this month will burn long in baseball history . The winningest team in the game when the strike hit ( 74-40 ) , owner Claude Brochu ordered his payroll - already the game 's second lowest a year ago at $ 24.2 million - pared to $ 11 million . Larry Walker , a home-grown Canadian , left for Colorado through free agency . GM Kevin Malone traded closer John Wetteland to the New York Yankees and pitcher Ken Hill to the St. Louis Cardinals . Then , in a final transaction that would boil the blood of execs from another era , Malone sent Marquis Grissom , viewed by many as the finest center fielder in the league , to division rival Atlanta . <p> Said Malone , " I told John Schulerholz , making that deal for Marquis Grissom will mean him a championship sometime down the road . " <p> Dismantling a championship contender is one thing . Trading within a team 's own division is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is baseball blasphemy . Malone was able to clear a total $ 3.5 million in cash plus some prospects in dealing . But even Schuerholz , a traditionalist , admitted , " Good deal for us . Bad for the game . " <p> Bad time to be a free agent <p> " It makes me sick to my stomach , to tell you the truth , " said Detroit general manager Joe Klein . " You know how hard people worked in the Montreal organization and in the Kansas City organization . Montreal has become a really strong organization , and then through circumstances they have no control over - because of the system - they lose these players . " <p> This is not to say the players are enjoying this either . While the top stars are finding market value , a vast number are finding their worth slashed . From the Expos ' yard sale to hard-lining in Cleveland to downscaling nearly everywhere else , baseball executives are paring to keep the 1995 payroll to $ 900 million . Teams paid out a combined $ 1.14 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projection reflects the 11 percent reduction in schedule due to the strike . <p> It is not a good time to be heading for arbitration , a worse time to seek an extension and in most cases a nightmare to be a free agent . <p> " You do n't know if the owners are colluding or what , " said agent Ron Simon . " What the owners are going to do is cut anybody who 's progressing up the salary ladder unless the guy 's a superstar , or takes a lot less than he previously made . If not , they 'll dump him and take advantage of the fact that the other owners are doing the same thing . " <p> The Florida Marlins dumped eight of their 12 biggest contracts and have cut raises by 50 percent for non-arbitration eligible players . The Milwaukee Brewers are targeting their payroll at $ 16 million to $ 17 million after allocating $ 23.5 million last summer . Something has to give in Minnesota , where the payroll is to be limited to $ 18 million or 19 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aguilera , Kevin Tapani , Scott Erickson and Chuck Knoblauch - scheduled to make a total of $ 17 million . <p> The Braves - along with the Chicago Cubs and White Sox , the Yankees and Colorado - have been able to free up post-strike money to invest in players , had hoped to keep payroll close to $ 40 million but failed . They may come in around $ 46 million . <p> More claims of collusion <p> All of this will be heaped upon the table whenever the two sides decide to resume labor negotiations . But clearly , whatever sense of compromise that accompanied the luxury tax breakthrough in late March has hardened . Miller , who fathered the Players Association in the late 1960s , expressed dismay that Donald Fehr , his successor and still confidante , would even consider any mechanism to limit salaries . Moreover , he still feels the atmopshere is ripe for another walkout . <p> " I certainly hope that would n't happen , " Miller said . " I suppose you would have to answer that in terms of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new leaf ? " <p> The union does n't seem to think so , at least to judge by Fehr 's decision last week to open another collusion investigation . Ownership has been found guilty of it three times before in the mid ' 80s and was made to pay $ 280 million to players who were low-balled . <p> There may also be a rift forming within management , as owners realize their solidiarity over the past eight months has acquired them nothing . Yankees owner George Steinbrenner has previously said Selig had brought the owners the best leadership they 've ever had . But when he was asked last week whether Selig should continue to hold the office , the Dodgers ' O'Malley said , " My answer is no . Two letters , one word . No . " <p> It is difficult to believe either side would allow another strike this season , for both sides have a better-than-ever understanding now of the consequences , not only to their own pockets but to the game they 've been entrusted with . The dealings of the past month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries , even other professional leagues , have accomplished similar tasks under more trying circumstances and with far less discord . <p> Inconceivably , that reform appears no closer now than it did last Aug. 12 . All that has changed when they resume play Tuesday night is it will become easier to distinguish the losers from the winners . <p> " I do n't call us winners , " said the Brewers ' Seitzer . " Only baseball is a winner because it 's back . But it 's been severely abused and kicked and beaten up . I compare this to a boxer who wins a fight in which he loses sight in both eyes , and has a concussion and a tumor . If you can call him a winner , go ahead . "
