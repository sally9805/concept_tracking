Sex after 50 ? Maybe you ca n't imagine it , but for millions of women who 've reached " a certain age , " sex just seems to get better with time . One of the joys of being a mature diva is having lived with what you desire . What else can a truly mature diva do ? The erotic impulse has nothing to do with age . If you can breathe , you can feel sexy and be sexual . For many women , once menstruation stops and they no longer have to worry about pregnancy , they feel free ! Sex and sexuality take on a more global perspective  --  if you get my meaning . In fact , my research and conversations with mature divas in the know strongly indicate that the years past age 50 can be a time for exploring the wonders of sex at deeper and more satisfying and confident levels than ever before . With sex , getting older means getting better  --  knowing what you enjoy , what you do n't enjoy , knowing how to give pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society does n't exactly go out of the way to assure mature women of their wonderfulness . Too many hurtful myths and jokes ridicule the woman over 50 who dares see herself as sexually attractive . There are still too few books , TV shows or films about the positive experiences of sexually active mature women . I 've often wondered how much of this negativity  --  in our male-dominated society  --  is based on male envy of our physical ability to continue to have sex well past menopause , because for men growing older often means impotence . But despite the negativity , women over 50 continue telling one another stories  --  over the phone , at the Laundromat , at the office  --  about the joy of their continuing sexuality . Though they are by no means the majority , there are men who value the mature woman 's experience and find her physically and emotionally attractive . Many older men and some younger ones , too , are never happier than when engaged in a meaningful relationship with a mature woman . Whether married to her or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , competence and insight . MARRIED SEX AFTER 50 For couples in their fifties and beyond whose sex lives have become predictably dull , the experiences of Joan and Richard may be enlightening . Joan , a 54-year-old educational consultant , has been married to Richard , 56 , an auto salesman , for 30 years . Their three daughters are grown and on their own . A few years ago Joan and Richard moved into a smaller house in their native Detroit , which Joan told me during a recent phone conversation " is just right for the two of us . Then we gradually started cutting back on our work hours , started taking more time for us . Since we 're both in great health , we 've probably got another good 20 or so years together . We realized the need to stop working ourselves to death and enjoy the wonderful years ahead of us . " Last year we took our first vacation alone together since before the girls were born . Well , I guess we kind of rediscovered each other during those three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in years about how we feel about each other and how sex between us had become routine and predictable . So we threw out all our old habits and started from the beginning . The results were amazing . We took more time  --  you know , lingered longer during each stage of lovemaking , especially foreplay . We tried new positions and even experimented with some sex toys . After the vacation , we kept on making time for sex . Though we do n't desire sex as often as we used to , the quality and the intensity of our sex life have improved immeasurably . " The fact that Joan and Richard are now at a stage in life that allows them more control of their time is a definite plus . For younger couples under the pressure of midnight baby feedings or murderous work schedules necessitated by the climb up the career ladder , sex is often rushed or perfunctory . There 's just no time . When there is time , they 're often too tired . But for people like Joan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that Joan and Richard have spent 30 years knowing each other  --  emotionally , sexually , spiritually  --  was an advantage in terms of reinventing their sex life . The fear of contracting an STD ( sexually transmitted disease ) like hepatitis , certain vaginal infections , venereal disease ( VD ) , HIV or AIDS is all that stands between many mature divas and a satisfying sex life . But my long-time friend Janice , a 57-year-old computer operator at a large Los Angeles corporation who is happily single and childless , says there 's a big , bright light at the end of this seemingly endless and depressing tunnel . " Yes , I 'm having enjoyable safe sex , " she said in her refreshing , no-nonsense way . " I refuse to let fears of STDs force me to relinquish the erotic element in my life . " The biggest obstacle Janice encountered on the way to her blissful new state ? " My own ingrained attitudes and habits , " she replied without hesitation . " I was used to having sex on the spur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to worry about was unwanted pregnancy or VD . Antibiotics took care of VD ; the Pill and other contraception took care of pregnancy . So I luxuriated in the bliss of unprotected spontaneous sex . Everybody resists change , I guess , until faced with some irrefutable reality . For me it came down to this : Change or be celibate . So I found a safe-sex workshop and got busy . " First , I figured out how to protect myself ; then I took responsibility for doing just that . With the stakes being life or death , it 's not about trust ; there 's not that much trust in the world . The most respectable people lie about their past lives and their possible exposure to AIDS . " Safe sex definitely is n't boring . At the workshop I learned to turn precaution into erotic play . We practiced putting latex condoms  --  the safest kind  --  on cucumbers and zucchini . Some men , having never used a condoms , find a woman 's help erotic . See what I mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on right . I learned not to wait until " the big moment " to introduce the subject of safe sex , but to make it part of the getting-to-know-you ritual . " What other safe-sex tools did Janice discover ? " There are condoms of varying textures and weights for vaginal , anal or oral sex ; one brand of oral-sex condoms , called Sheik , comes in mint flavors . Dental dams protect the mouth during oral sex . There are even fingertip condoms . " How did Janice find a safe-sex workshop ? " At the local gay community center , " she said . " What ? " " Uh , huh . Gays are miles ahead of straights about promoting safe sex , so I attended free workshops at the gay center , even though I am decidedly straight . That was five years ago . Today straight people know they are n't immune to AIDS , so there 's more information  --  more , but not enough . There 's still too much denial about who can get AIDS and who ca n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the likelihood of contracting AIDS , from most risky to least risky as follows : anal sex , vaginal sex , oral sex . Public-health officials recommend that sexually active people with more than one partner and people whose partner just might have multiple partners ( despite assurances to the contrary ) get with the safe-sex program . For the mature diva , who can take an unhurried look at her sexuality , figuring out how to do safe sex can be less intimidating than for a younger woman . After all , the older woman has probably already experienced a lot of sex  --  pleasurable and not so pleasurable . This experience can only be helpful when trying to figure out the necessary adjustments that will lead to the most satisfying sex humanly possible . Another friend , Rose , an early retiree of 54 , told me over a cup of tea one evening after work about an intriguing relationship she 's enjoying that involves exciting safe sex  --  with a younger man . Rose , a widow , swears she had four kids before she experienced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a teenager because I thought that 's what I was supposed to do . I was such an actress  --  moaning and sighing , like in the movies  --  but really nothing was happening . John did n't know what he was doing ; neither did I. That 's also how we had four kids in three years . It sure took long enough , but honey , once I caught on during my thirties , there was no stopping me . I was 45 when my dear late husband , John , had a fatal stroke . I wo n't bore you with details about all the bumblers and fumblers I encountered when I finally ventured out on the dating scene again . Then , finally , I met Shariff . " I was n't ready , let me tell you . I mean , here I am in my fifties having this wonderful relationship with a man in his thirties . Nobody ever told me this could happen . And the man did his homework . Okay ? Not only does Shariff have the safe-sex thing down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yoga ? " I asked . " What 's that got to do with sex ? " " Plenty . Shariff taught me those yoga positions and breathing techniques that heighten sexual pleasure to almost unbearable degrees and allow you to prolong sexual activity for hours . Believe me , I am a happy student . " That 's because Rose refused to forget how wonderful sex can be , because she knows her body , because she was persistent and refused to settle for " fumblers and bumblers , " and because she kept an open mind and was ready for an eye-opening relationship with a younger man . Once again it 's about drawing on the wisdom of experience . For older adults who are experiencing physical disability , some of the yoga positions can make a world of difference . ( See the reading list following this article . ) SEX BEYOND 60 What about women in their sixties and seventies ? According to Ms. Louella , a 72-year-old retired diva I always see at the supermarket , where there 's a will , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the detergent aisle usually start off about the high price of food and end up about furniture , modern dance , politics , whatever . Ms. Louella , a former nurse 's aide who walks with a crutch , attends a senior-citizens day program . That 's where she met Mr. Henry , age 70 , and fell in love . " Sweetie , it 's very hot , " she told me in the bread aisle recently . " Got me squeezing my thighs together just thinking about him . He has his own place , and so do I. We 're not always up under each other . I like that . " She leaned closer and whispered confidentially , " We do n't practice intercourse , we practice " outercourse . ' ' " I was flabbergasted . " Oh ? I never heard of that . " She laughed . " Well , sweetie , where there 's a will , there 's a way . We do n't work the inside , we work the outside . Like some guys over 50 , Henry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative . He uses his fingers , his mouth . He goes right for the clitoris . That 's where it 's at , right , sweetie ? " " Right , Ms. Louella , " I laughed . " Last Thursday afternoon I had so many orgasms , " she continued . " Mornings and afternoons are best since we 're more energetic . My doctor said it 's great for me . With my heart trouble and arthritis , he said sex reduces stress and promotes well-being . You know , Mr. Henry called me last night . Said he 's got something new for me . I did n't say anything , but I 've got something new for him , too . " We both laughed . " See you later , sweetie . Got ta get me some greens and sweet potatoes so I can keep up my strength . " For me the greatest thing about Ms. Louella 's story was her ability to be open-minded , to explore and discover with Mr. Henry new ways of sharing sexual pleasure . They realized that impotence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to mean no sex . For women whose impotent partners are n't as creative as Mr. Henry , a series of visits  --  as a couple  --  to a reputable sex therapist might be a rewarding option .

" THE ART OF SELF-SATISFACTION " Solitary sex  --  masturbation  --  is another answer that many older divas who find themselves without a sexual partner are discovering or rediscovering . " The art of self-satisfaction , " is the way my friend Yvonne so charmingly puts it . She and other older divas who enjoy satisfying solitary sex told me all about the vibrators and dildos and even ( yes ! ) inflatable dolls they utilize . My friend Gwen told me that her widowed mother requested one of these dolls as a Christmas gift because she was " bored with vibrators and dildos . " By the way , Gwen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . In many ways the mature lesbian is a steps ahead of her heterosexual sister . Lesbians do n't generally seem to be as youth-oriented or as neurotic about body size as heterosexuals ; also , because they value women 's wisdom in a way that could be instructive to many heterosexuals , they treasure older women even more . At a lesbian social event , one is more likely to see women of all ages and sizes dancing and flirting with prospective partners of all ages . Young lesbians are often impressed and turned on by a mature woman 's experience in life . And among lesbians , larger body size is often seen as power and is therefore attractive . Because many lesbians have experimented with sex toys throughout their lives , the older lesbian who is without a partner is more comfortable with utilizing these tools in solitary sex . This is not to say that all older lesbians are perfectly free of fears and worries about aging , but that the lesbian community seems to have done a little more homework in this area . Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if she wants to . On the other hand , she does n't have to do it if she does n't want to . For all the over-50 women like Joan , Rose , Janice , Miss Louella , Yvonne or Gwen 's mother , there are others who for various reasons do n't want sex anymore . Some of them half-heartedly joke about being " new virgins . " Because of very real fears about AIDS , they reluctantly find themselves disinclined toward sex . It is also true that sexuality does change with age , not just emotionally , but physically . Perhaps the most common changes are the vaginal dryness and weakened vaginal muscles that can develop as we age . Dryness can be remedied with any number of lubricants available at most pharmacies . And a gynecologist or exercise therapist can recommend simple exercises to strengthen the muscles of the vagina . What does not have to change , regardless of age or sexual inclination , is the wonderful vastness of sex and sexuality . In youth , sex is filled with wonder and discovery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater capacity to experience sex more deeply , with increased confidence and appreciation . It is the glorious gift we can continue to give and receive at any age . Hattie Gossett is the author of Presenting ...
