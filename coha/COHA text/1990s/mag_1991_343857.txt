Roger Ligon , a maintenance worker in Stamford , Conn. , was on trial for manslaughter , charged with killing a man after a parking dispute . He pleaded not guilty , blaming the act on post-traumatic stress disorder  --  the psychological residue of his combat experience in Vietnam . <P> The lawyers who argued the Ligon case had another sort of stress to deal with , arising from the crush of TV cameras that descended on the courtroom . Local stations covered the trial extensively . So did a soon-to-be-launched cable channel devoted entirely to judicial proceedings . A CBS crew was there too , roaming the hallways and offices as well as the courtroom . " The whole second floor up here was just one gigantic production room , " grouses Bruce Hudock , who prosecuted the case . " I definitely found it distracting . " <P> Hudock 's view may be tainted by sour grapes : Ligon was acquitted . But the prosecutor 's objections can not be totally dismissed . Courtroom trials have become TV 's hottest reality-programming trend . Forty-four states currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions ( New York 's law has just expired , as legislators argue over proposed revisions to it ) . And starting next month , TV will for the first time be allowed into some federal courts , on an experimental basis , for civil trials . <P> Real-life trial footage regularly turns up on local newscasts , on magazine shows like A Current Affair and Trial Watch , and occasionally as live drama on CNN . The legal bombardment is about to grow even heavier . On June 21 , CBS will introduce Verdict , a prime-time series that will cover a different trial each week , using a mix of courtroom footage and interviews with the participants . ( The Ligon case will be featured in one of the episodes . ) <P> Courtroom activity will go round the clock with the July 1 debut of the Courtroom Television Network , a judicial version of CNN . The new cable channel ( owned largely by Time Warner ) will cover some trials live  --  with play-by- play commentary from legal experts  --  and others on tape in nightly wrap-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles trial of four police officers charged in the videotaped beating of Rodney King . <P> For TV viewers bred on Perry Mason melodramatics , this proliferation of courtroom coverage is a healthy dose of reality . Steven Brill , chief executive of Court TV , predicts an educational windfall for people who watch his channel . " They will understand that the real world of law is not L.A. Law ; nor is it Clint Eastwood catching a criminal and having some slick lawyer get the criminal off on a technicality . " But TV 's invasion of the courtroom raises tough questions as well . While video coverage may boost the public 's understanding of the judicial process , is it quite so good for people seeking their constitutionally guaranteed right to a fair trial ?
