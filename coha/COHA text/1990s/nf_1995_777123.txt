RAISING THE GARTEL // Non-human animals have life cycles . Humans have biographies . //  --  GRAHAM RICHARDS // I met my first Neandertal in a cafe in Paris , just across the street from the Jussieu Metro stop . It was a wet afternoon in May , and I was sitting on a banquette with my back to the window . The cafe was smoky and charmless . Near the entrance , a couple of students were thumping on a pinball machine called GENESIS ! , which beeped approval every time they scored . The place was packed with people of all types  --  French workers , foreign students , professors , young professionals , Arabs , Africans , and even a couple of Japanese tourists , all thrown together by the rain . Our coffee had just arrived , and I found that if I tucked my elbow down when raising my cup , I could drink it without poking the ribs of a bearded man sitting at the table next to me , who was deep into an argument . // Above the noise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking place in a small public space , a French anthropologist named Jean-Jacques Hublin was telling me about the anatomical unity of man . Anatomically speaking , Hublin himself was compact and muscular , with dark curly hair , a strong chin and mouth , and wide-set brown eves that never looked away from the person he was addressing . It was he who had brought along the Neandertal . When we came into the cafe , be had placed an object wrapped in a soft rag on the table and bad ignored it ever since . Like anything so carefully neglected , it was beginning to monopolize my attention . // " Perhaps you would be interested in this , " he said at last , whisking away the rag . There , amid the clutter of demitasse and empty sugar wrappers , was a large human lower jawbone . The teeth , worn and yellowed by time , were all in place . Around us , I felt the cafe raise a collective eyebrow . ( It is part of the unspoken etiquette of Parisian cafes that while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic an interest in what you are staring at . ) The hubbub of talk sank audibly . Impassive faces turned in our direction . The bearded man next to me stopped in mid-sentence , looked at the jaw , looked at Hublin , and resumed his argument . Hublin gently nudged the fossil to the center of the table and leaned back . // " What is it ? " I asked . // " It is a Neandertal from a site called Zafarraya , in the south of Spain , " he said . He picked it up , turned it around in his hands , and thoughtfully traced the flow of the jaw 's bottom edge with a forefinger . " We have only this mandible and an isolated femur from another individual at the site . But as you can see , the jaw is almost complete . We are not sure yet , but it may be that this fossil is only thirty thousand years old . " // " Only thirty thousand years " may seem an odd way of expressing time , but coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like saying that a professional basketball player is only six feet four . Hominids  --  members of the exclusively human family tree  --  have been on the earth for at least four million years . Measured against the age of the earliest members of our lineage , the mineralized piece of bone on the table was a mewling newborn . Even compared to others of its kind , the jaw was astonishingly young . Neandertals were supposed to have disappeared fully five thousand years before this one was born , and I had come to France to find out what might have happened to them . I was definitely interested in the specimen . // The Neandertals are the best known and least understood of all human ancestors . To most people , the name instantly brings to mind the image of a hulking brute , dragging his mate around by her coif . This stereotype , born almost as soon as the first skeleton was found in a German cave in the middle of the last century , has been re-fluffed in comic books , novels , and movies so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlance . // " If I call you a Neandertal , you know right away I am not paying you a compliment , " anthropologist David Frayer of the University of Kansas once told me . To professionals like Frayer and Hublin , whose job is to unravel the meaning of fossilized bones , the name represents something much more precise . What makes a Neandertal a Neandertal is not its size or its strength or any measure of its native intelligence , but a suite of exquisitely distinct physical traits , most of them in the face and cranium . Like all Neandertal mandibles , for example , the one on the table lacked the bony protrusion on the rim of the jaw called a mental eminence  --  better known as a chin . The front teeth were thick but badly worn , almost to stubs . The places on the outside of the jaw where chewing muscles had once been attached were grossly enlarged , indicating tremendous torque in the bite . Between the two last molars and the upward thrust of the rear of the jaw , Hublin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an architectural nicety shifting the business of chewing farther toward the front . // In this , and in several other features , the jaw was uniquely , quintessentially Neandertal ; no other member of the human family before or since shows the same pattern . With a litte instruction , the Neandertal pattern is recognizable even by a layman like myself , who , until I became involved with them , would have guessed that a " Mental Eminence " was a title given to an unusually erudite cardinal . But to convey what " Neandertal " really means , solely on the basis of physical traits , would be like trying to describe the desire you feel when in love by shouting out your lover 's measurements . Neandertals had become , over the past months , a hounding , haunting obsession for me . Unlike Hublin , whose very expertise allowed him to sit there calmly sipping coffee while the jaw of a 30,000-year-old man rested within biting distance of his free hand , I felt like stooping down and paying homage . // Two years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provocative cover . Against a backdrop of shadowy forests and undulating fields of wheat , a man and a woman stood on either side of an apple tree . They were slim and beautiful , with elegantly proportioned bodies and full , vaguely African features . With their polished copper skin and taut physiques , they seemed more like the products of an exclusive health spa than the residents of an eternal paradise . But there was no mistaking this couple . The woman , her naked breasts veiled by her hair , was offering an apple to her partner , her face full of invitation . The man 's palm was open to receive the fruit , his lip arched in an innocent smile . Between the two , a fat green serpent coiled around the tree trunk , his yellow eye gleaming . // After a long hiatus , Adam and Eve were back in the news . They had made the cover of Newsweek riding on the back of rigorous , quantitative , thoroughly secular science . Based on a comparison of a particular kind of DNA found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Berkeley , California , had concluded that all human beings on earth could trace their ancestry back to a single woman who lived in Africa only 200,000 years ago . Every living branch and twig of the human family tree had shot up from this " mitochondrial Eve " and spread like kudzu over the face of the globe , binding all humans in an intimate web of relatedness . Genetically speaking , there was not all that much difference between a New Guinean highlander , a South African ! Kung tribeswoman , and a housewife from the Marin County hills across the Bay from Berkeley . Whatever appearances might suggest , they simply had n't had time enough to diverge . // " The Eve hypothesis , " as it came to be known , was a major development in the science of human evolution . But by putting it on its cover , Newsweek was taking a big risk . Articles jammed up with terms like " mitochondrial DNA " and " genetic distance " do not typically incite stampedes at the checkout counter , even when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked people on the cover . The news , furthermore , was not even new . The Berkeley study had been published in the academic journal Nature fully a year before . When the story idea was originally proposed to Newsweek 's regular science editor , she turned it down as too old for a topical feature magazine . A senior editor followed a hunch and decided to pursue the story anyway . // His instinct proved right . Later the same year , we watched in amazement as the Iran-Contra affair unfolded and the Iron Curtain rusted away . The AIDS epidemic reached into the heterosexual population , and the hottest summer on record turned the Greenhouse Effect into an international nightmare . Each globe-shaking development inspired a vivid new cover for Newsweek . The American presidential campaign provided the grist for several others . In the end , however , the best-selling cover story of 1988 proved to be the one at the farthest possible remove from current events : how the human race got started in the first place . // To me , the Eve hypothesis sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can be traced back to a single common ancestor just 200,000 years ago , then the entire human population of the globe really is one grand brother-and-sisterhood , despite the confounding embellishments of culture and race . Thus on a May afternoon , a cafe in Paris could play host to clientele from three or four continents , but the scene still amounted to a sort of ad hoc family reunion . If among the Africans and Asians and various Europeans coming in from the rain we could find a table for some Australian aborigines and room at the counter for a couple of Native Americans , it would still be just a slightly larger , better-attended family party . Likewise , if we could bring back to life some cultures driven to the brink of extinction or over it by the overenthusiasm of European colonialists , there might be an Andaman Island woman playing the pinball machine , with her deceased husband 's skull strapped on her shoulder for good luck ; or an Aztec priest looking dourly out at the Parisian drizzle ; or perhaps an Ona Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his ponderous browridges at the trio of high school girls bestowing lavish farewell kisses on one another 's cheeks . Family , all . // But Eve bore a darker message too . The Berkeley study suggested that at some point between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago , people from Africa began to disperse across Europe and Asia , and eventually populated the Americas as well . These people , and these alone , became the ancestors of all future human generations . When they arrived in Eurasia , however , there were thousands , perhaps even millions , of other human beings already living there . Among the best known of these were the Neandertals . If the genes of everybody alive trace back to that single African population , what happened to all those non-African genes ? Eve 's answer was cruelly unequivocal . The Neandertals  --  including the Zafarraya population represented by the jaw on the table-were pushed aside , outcompeted , or otherwise driven extinct by the new arrivals from the south . The genetic replacement was total . The Eve hypothesis strongly implied that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interbreed , at least not in a way that produced fertile offspring . Except for those African-bred genes , the human slate was wiped clean , eliminating a million years of human development in a single stroke . Looked at from this point of view , the Eve hypothesis did not endorse the underlying unity of humankind so much as play witness to its universal brutality : " a scientific rendering , " as one critic put it , " of the story of Cain . " // What fascinates me about the fate of the Neandertals  --  Abel 's side of the story  --  is the paradox of their promise . Appearing first in Europe about 120,000 years ago , the Neandertals flourished through the increasing cold of an approaching Ice Age , and by 70,000 years ago they had spread throughout Europe and western Asia . As far as appearance goes , the popular stereotype of a muscled thug is not completely off the mark . Thick-boned , barrel-chested , a healthy Neandertal male could lift an average NFL linebacker over his head and throw him through the goalposts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing that clearly distinguishes a Neandertal 's brain from that of a modern human being except for the fact that , on average , the Neandertal version was slightly larger . There is no trace of the thoughts that animated those brains , so we do not know how much they resembled our own . But a big brain is an expensive piece of adaptive equipment . You do n't evolve one if you do n't use it . Combining enormous physical strength with manifest intelligence , the Neandertals appear to have been outfitted to face any obstacle that the environment could put in their path . They could not lose . // And then , somehow , they lost . Just when the Neandertals reached their most advanced expression , they suddenly vanished from the earth . Their demise coincides suspiciously with the presumed arrival into Western Europe of a new kind of human : taller , thinner , more modern-looking people . I say " presumed " because we do not really have any direct evidence of what these new people looked like . All we have is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools ; the pierced beads and pendants they draped on their bodies ; the carved animal figurines full of sinuous , sensual expression that appear to mark the arrival not only of a new people but of a new form of consciousness . // The collision of these two human populations  --  us and the other , the destined parvenu and the doomed caretaker of a continent  --  is as potent and marvelous a part of the human story as anything that has happened since . If you doubt me , take a quick look at the sales figures for The Clan of the Cave Bear , or any of Jean Auel 's subsequent romances . The meeting between the first modern humans and the last Neandertals resonates far beyond the actual events in the Paleolithic Age , and novelists have been quick to take advantage of it . This imagined encounter was , after all , the last between ourselves and another intelligent , intelligible form of being . In paleo-fiction , the Neandertals play the same role in the past that extraterrestrials play in the fiction of the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limitations , more than it disparages their own . The modern humans arrive and prevail , in most cases violently . In William Golding 's The Inheritors , a Neandertal named Lok struggles to comprehend what is happening as his comrades are systematically exterminated by intruders whose lethal powers so fascinate him that he barely hears his own howls of grief . In Auel 's romances , Ayla , the modern human heroine , quickly outstrips the Neandertals who have adopted her ; their brains are too crammed with tribal memory to leave room for her kind of innovative thinking . But it is not the triumph of a superior race that drives the plots of these books . It is the loss of an alternative one . // By itself , the half-jaw on the table in front of me was not nearly so eloquent as Lok 's anguished wonder or as sexy as Ayla 's exploits . But it had its own tale to tell . Hublin had said that the Zafarraya jaw was perhaps as young as 30,000 years old . A few months before , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new dates of their own for some Spanish sites . Applying a new technique to date some modern human-style artifacts in the caves , they astonished everyone by declaring them to be 40,000 years old . This was 6,000 years before there were supposed to have been modern humans in Europe . If both Bischoff 's and Hublin 's dates were right , it meant that Neandertals and modern humans had been sharing Spanish soil for 10,000 years . That did n't make sense to me. // " At thirty thousand years , " I asked Hublin , " would n't this jaw be the last Neandertal known ? " // " If we are right about the date , yes , " he said . " But our dates are still very preliminary . There is much work to be done before we can say how old the jaw is for certain . " // " But Bischoff says modem humans were in Spain ten thousand years before then , " I persisted . " I can understand how a population with a superior technology might come into an area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But ten thousand years does n't sound very quick , even in evolutionary terms . How can two kinds of human being exist side by side for that long without sharing their cultures ? Without sharing their genes ? " // Hublin shrugged , in the classically cryptic French manner meaning either " The answer is obvious " or " How should I know ? " // " Do n't forget , " he said , " those modern human sites Bischoff is talking about are in the north part of the country . That area may have been part of a penetration of modern humans into Europe along the coast of the Mediterranean . But this penetration did not occur in the south . Southern Spain is very much a cul-de-sac . " // Hublin outlined his own version of the Neandertal fate , a scenario in which the old residents of Europe , molded into an increasingly specialized way of life by centuries of isolation , were done in by a combination of sudden climatic shifts and new competition . The end result was much the same as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed into ever-shrinking pockets of habitation that eventually petered out altogether , like the dying embers of an abandoned hearth . The story made sense , but its validity hung upon the strength of that date . // As he talked , I kept my head down , struggling to keep up with him as I made my notes . When I finally looked around , I was surprised to find that I was not the only listener . The jaw seemed to have broken down the invisible grid that keeps each table in a cafe locked in its private space . Instead , a circle of common curiosity was spreading out from the fossil : people sitting with their bodies slightly twisted by the effort to keep an eye on the jaw and listen to Hublin . The argument between the bearded fellow next to me and his companion had fallen into a series of jumpstarted fragments , truncated by bouts of unabashed eavesdropping and fossil-ogling . Even les mecs at the pinball machine were staring our way between their turns . // Before Hublin slipped it back in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hinged to an upper jaw , it had once been ribboned in muscle and laced with animating nerve and blood vessels . The jaw had bitten deep into warm flesh and pulled in lungfuls of frosted air as the Zafarraya Neandertal chased game or ran in fear . Though silent now amid the cafe babble , it too perhaps had once formed words , argued with companions , told stories about the past and made plans for the future . But there would be no future . Somehow , against all logic , another kind of human had come in and stolen posterity from the Neandertals . How that theft was accomplished is the oldest question in human evolutionary science . Lately the familiar answers , the ones I had been brought up believing , had been peppered by an onslaught of new discoveries and quickly , completely , irrevocably discredited . Instead , the Neandertals and their European conquerors were now caught together in a web of mysteries that stretched out of Europe and covered the globe . // What is a modem human being ? How did it get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us is Homo sapiens sapiens , a kind of taxonomic stutter meaning " double-wise man . " The redundancy drives home the point that our turbocharged intelligence distinguishes us not only from the other animals on earth but also from the other members of the hominid family who came before us . In a nomenclatural sense , " Neandertal Man " is only half as smart , bearing a single sapiens in his formal designation , Homo sapiens neanderthalensis . Earlier members of our genus such as Homo erectus and Homo habilis , though cleverer than anything else around at the time , carry no wisdom at all in their names . // The lofty title seems justified , if a bit ironic . Ours is , after all , the species that brought the spearthrower and the bow and arrow onto the planet , as well as the switchblade and the smart bomb ; Plato as well as Pol Pot , Moses and Machiavelli too . Along the way , we have also introduced the needle , the button , the bead , the harpoon , fish nets , domesticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand different languages , metaphor , social status , social welfare , religion and religious wars , race and racial wars , civil rights and civil wars , irony , sports , jokes , jurisprudence , stocks and bonds , slash-and-burn agriculture , national parks , national pride , political philosophy , petroleum refinement , the automobile , the traffic jam , the car phone , fast food , slow torture , microchips , mass slaughter , ozone holes , cervical plugs , carbon dioxide blankets , private property , and public relations , to name a few double-wise innovations . Twenty thousand years ago , modern humans were carving Venus figurines out of pieces of ivory ; now we sit on the sofa and watch the planet Venus pass by on our television screens . // Though we deserve to be called Homo sapiens sapiens , the taxonomic designation is too cold and too clumsy . Until recently , a cozier , more familiar synonym was " Cro-Magnon Man , " a name borrowed from a tiny rock shelter in southern France . In 1868 , some fossilized skeletons that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cave . You can probably conjure up an image of Cro-Magnon ; you 've seen him portrayed at the end of a glossy , full-color time line illustrating the stages of human evolution in some magazine or museum display . Wearing beads and furs and toting a neatly crafted spear , Cro-magnon Man is shown striding hurriedly off the right-hand side of the page , as if to distance himself as quickly as possible from the progression of stooped and hairy brutes that crowd up behind him in the ancestral queue . Immediately to his left is Neandertal " Man . " ( Only recently have time lines acknowledged that two sexes are needed to keep them moving along . Chinless , beetle-browed Neandertal Man has a big bead but a dullish sort of look about him , as if he is dumbly wondering where evolution will take him next . In contrast , Cro-Magnon stands tall , white , thin , and relatively hairless , though he often sports a well-trimmed beard . He holds his chin high , his gaze clear and true beneath a worthy vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time lines a bit of a bore . With his skins and shorn feet and all his power accessories , he looks too self-important . This is a hominid who has arrived . It was once said ( and often repeated ) that , given a shave and a set of clothes , his neighbor Neandertal Man could travel unnoticed in a subway car at rush hour . If this is true , it is only because commuters try very hard not to notice anyone at all . There is no doubt , however , about Cro-Magnon : Strip off the animal skins , slide him into a Pierre Cardin suit , and he would pass without comment on any subway , though he 'd probably be more comfortable taking a cab . Poised at the very end of a scale of increasing refinement , he is , for all his polish , just a triffle too familiar . You can admire his spear , his level stare and polished comportment , but then your eyes drift irresistibly back to the left , to the mysterious half-apes and demihumans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the relative dearth of mystery . Among all the events and transformations in human evolution , the origins of modern humans were , until recently , the easiest to account for . Around 35,000 years ago , signs of a new , explosively energetic culture in Europe marked the beginning of the period knowing as the Upper Paleolithic . They included a highly sophisticated variety of tools , made out of bone and antler as well as stone . Even more important , the people making these tools had discovered a symbolic plane of existence , evident in their gorgeously painted caves , carved animal figurines , and the beads and pendants adorning their bodies , The Neandertals who had inhabited Europe for tens of thousands of years had never produced anything remotely as elaborate . Coinciding with this cultural explosion were the first signs of the kind of anatomy that distinguishes modern human beings : a welldefined chin , a high , vertical forehead lacking pronounced browridges , a domed braincase , and a relatively slender , lightly built frame , among other , more esoteric features . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 32,000 and 30,000 years old , provided an exquisite microcosm of the joined emergence of culture and anatomy . Five skeletons , including one of an infant , were found buried in a communal grave , all exhibiting the anatomical characteristics of modern human beings . Scattered in the grave with them were hundreds of artificially pierced seashells and animal teeth , clearly the vestiges of necklaces , bracelets , and other body ornaments . The nearly simultaneous appearance of modern culture and modern anatomy provided a ready-made explanation for the final step in the human journey . Since they happened at the same time , the reasoning went , obviously one had caused the other . It all made good clean Darwinian sense . A more efficient technology emerged to take over the survival role previously provided by brute strength , relaxing the need for the robust physiques and powerful chewing apparatus of the Neandertals . Voila ! Suddenly there was clever , slender Cro-Magnon Man . That this first truly modern human should be indigenous to Europe tightened the evolutionary narrative : Modern man first appeared in precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later reached its zenith . Prehistory foreshadowed history . The only issue to sort out was whether the Cro-Magnons had entered the continent from somewhere else , or whether the Neandertals had evolved into them . // In these last few years , new fossils , new techniques , and new approaches have completely obliterated this once-comfortable hypothesis . The most damaging blows have come from Africa and the Middle East , where it now appears that fully modern human anatomy  --  the biological entity known as Homo sapiens sapiens  --  had already emerged as early as 100,000 years ago . According to the " Out of Africa " hypothesis , these earliest modern humans eventually spread out to take over the territory of all other existing hominids . But , so far at least , there is no sign that these hyper-successful moderns were making fancy tools , painting caves , or otherwise doing " modern " things . Modern behavior can no longer explain modern human form , because by all appearances modern culture did n't even exist for another 60,000 years . Suddenly , the emergence of anatomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well try to account for the origin of the wind by talking about sailboats. // One consequence of this temporal delamination is that the name Cro-Magnon can no longer be used to mean " early modern human . " The Cro-Magnons were only one , late example of a much more widely spread phenomenon . In this book , I use the name only when referring to the early moderns of Europe . Otherwise , I am stuck with the rather colorless phrase " modern human " to represent the most astonishing creature that has yet emerged upon the planet Earth . But there is a far deeper consequence to the delamination than just a recasting of names . Where there once was one tidy explanation for our origins , there are now two separate rate , equally inexplicable enigmas . Why modem human bodies , if changes in our ancestors ' behavior do not account for them ? And why , after a delay of at least 50,000 years , did these modern bodies suddenly start behaving like humans ? What double-handed power pushed us into being ? // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Darwin was born , there were plenty of answers to go around . In Genesis , God makes man out of clay and woman from the rib of man- they eat a forbidden apple , and the human race is off and running . But this is only one creation story among many . For thousands of years before the Bible was written , other Adams and other Eves had been discovering each other in legends scattered from the Near East to the South Pacific . Everywhere you look in indigenous cultures , our first parents are being crafted from liquid fire or hacked out of melting blocks of ice , or are popping out of the belly , head , thigh , or armpit of some dozing deity . In Eskimo legend , the first man pushes his way out of a pea pod . According to their myths , the fierce Yanomamo of Brazil erupted from drops of blood spilling from a wounded god flying overhead . The Quiche Maya of Guatemala had a deity named Maker , who tried to fashion human beings out of first mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he successfully ground humans from yellow and white corn , with a little water added to make fat . If you lived in China around 600 B.C. , you accepted on faith that we all began as fleas infesting the pelt of the Great Creator , Phan Ku. // Among world religions , the Judeo-Christian tradition draws an unusually clean line between what is animal and what is human . Many non- Western religions endow animals , birds , and even individual blades of grass with spirit . But in the Bible only human beings have souls and are capable of salvation . For a lion , a tulip , or an HIV virus , original sin is simply not an issue . Evolution , of course , respects no such distinction . In the last century , Darwin proposed a mechanism that could explain how humankind could emerge by descent from more primitive ancestors , just like every other living species . In our own century , the fossil fruits harvested on the African savanna and elsewhere have largely proved him right . But up until just a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still keep the division between beasts and human beings clear . You did n't need God 's hand to fashion a modem man or woman out of animal clay . You just needed time . Lots and lots of it . // I must confess that I am a sucker for time lines . On the far left , at the extreme remove from spiffy Cro-Magnon , the time lines begin with a little apelike thing with a projecting face , walking with bent knees . For the time being we call this first well-established member of the human lineage Australopithecus afarensis  --  the species famously represented by the skeleton Lucy . ( In the fall of 1994 , scientists working in Ethiopia announced they had found fossil fragments of an even older hominid , believed to have lived very close to the point where the human and ape lineages split off from each other . ) To the right of afarensis , a handful of hairy intermediates marches awkwardly , inevitably , toward the future , each with its posture a little better and its brain a little bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation along the way is mesmerizing . You watch humanity unfold like a flower , each ancestor the ripened promise of the one that came before . // In effect , the single , explosive event told of in the genesis myths has been pulled gossamer-thin and stretched out over millions of years . But the end result is the same . This quaint evolutionary procession is the post-Darwinist , science-validated version of the line drawn between animal existence and human life . The fully animal thing is hidden just off the page to the left  --  before afarensis , before the even more primitive hominid recently discovered in Ethiopia . The contemporary human being  --  you  --  is parked just out of sight on the right , the unspoken consequence of Cro-Magnon . Even as the time line demonstrates how we evolved from lower creatures , it keeps us comfortably distanced from that bestial beginning by some four million years . Such an enormity of time is literally impossible for the human brain to imagine . You can divide it up into stages and decorate each one with a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slice it , four million years is more than enough time to preserve that sense of a separate human destiny , placating the closet creationist holed up inside each of us. // Much as I love gawking at time lines , however , I question whether they are telling the truth . Let 's start at the beginning . Ever since Louis and Mary Leakey began to pluck hominids out of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania in the 1950s , the glamour topic in human evolution has been the quest to identify the point , deepest in the past , when the human lineage diverged from that of the apes . Few scientists use the term " missing link " anymore , but if you were to scratch beneath the skin of a modern-day fossil hunter , you would discover that it is the hope of precisely such a find that motivates their efforts , thrills their followers , and opens the pockets of their donors . Pursued in obscure regions of the world , often under dangerous conditions , the search mixes the excitement of a treasure hunt with the righteousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , at the end of his popular account of the discovery of Lucy , looking forward to a return to the fossilrich deposits of Ethiopia where he found her : " What we find in them could well blow the roof off of everything , " he writes , because science has not known , and does not know today , just how , or when the all-important transition from ape to hominid took place . This is the biggest remaining challenge to paleoanthropology. " // The key word here is ' all-important . " Australopithecus afarensis is undoubtedly an important character in our evolution . An astonishing abundance of this species ' bones was discovered by Johanson and his colleagues in the mid-seventies , and more in this decade , in the remote Afar triangle in Ethiopia . A recently discovered afarensis skull is dated to around 3 million years old . It bears resemblances to another skull fragment found earlier in Ethiopia , believed to to around 3.9 million years old , and the rest of the known specimens fall between these dates . Thus the species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during which it underwent no meaningful changes in its form . // A number of specific anatomical traits distinguish afarensis from the apes , but one , feature above all others sets the species apart , right from the start  --  it walked on two legs . As evidence , we have not only Lucy 's undeniably upright skeleton and some other postcranial bones , but the astounding , four-million-year-old footprints , preserved in volcanic ash , found by Mary Leakey and her team at Laetoli in the late 1970s . An upright gait  --  bipedalism  --  has been touted as a hallmark of humanity since Darwin 's time , one of a handful of early specializations that not only define our particular evolutionary direction , but can be enlisted to explain it as well . We have been told over the years that the first hominids stood up on two legs because they were tool users and needed their hands free ; or because they became hunters who needed to see over tall savanna grass ; or because they were family men who required the use of their arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every explanation for bipedalism is braided into the realization of some grander , uniquely human habit , to be refined and perfected farther on up the family tree . No wonder this transition is declared " all-important . " It more or less decides the matter right from the start . // There is no doubt that Lucy 's species was hominid and walked upright on the ground . But is there anything about afarensis or its style of locomotion that necessarily leads to modern humans ? Lucy 's brain was only slightly larger than that of a modern chimpanzee . Her species did not make stone tools , nor in fact would any other hominid for at least another half a million years . At three and a half feet tall , she hardly seems likely to have gained much advantage over the savanna grass by letting go of the ground with her forelimbs . Preliminary evidence suggests that the recently found , even-more-primitive ancestor of Lucy was in fact already walking upright 800,000 years earlier , even though it had yet to make the move from a forested environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that either afarensis or the new hominid bunted game or shared food within a nuclear family unit . Though her bipedal gait on the ground is unquestioned , some anthropologists , such as Randall Susman at the State University of New York at Stony Brook , have pointed to features of afarensis limbs that suggest that the species spent a lot of its time off the ground , moving apelike through the trees . Other scientists dispute this . But in any case , afarensis remained bipedal for at least a million years without exhibiting the slightest tendency to become smarter , more dexterous , or more human . // Bipedalism alone does not augur intelligence , and never did . A dolphin with no legs or an elephant with four are both a lot cleverer than a kangaroo mouse or a sparrow with two . With her confirmed upright stance , Lucy certainly represents the result of a transition , but not necessarily an " all-important " one . It is more a shift in the center of gravity than an awakening of the human spirit . The lesson I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply animals  --  two-legged chimps  --  long after our lineage had split off from that of the apes . The same would , of course , apply to the earlier , " missing link " ancestor who actually did the splitting off . On its own , without the advantage of evolutionary hindsight , there is nothing about that genealogical divergence that foreshadows , triggers , or even remotely hints at a human being . // In modern versions of the human family tree , there is a fork above afarensis about two and a half million years ago . One branch leads toward Homo ; the other veers off to one side . This side branch bears fascinating fruit , but let us continue for a moment on the main stem . After afarensis comes the first species to merit inclusion in our own genus , Homo habilis . ( In some versions of the tree , another australopithecine squeezes in between them . ) You can easily pick this hominid out from the lineup : He 's usually the first one carrying a chipped rock in his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960s , the species name  --  " Handy Man "  --  pays tribute to a creature Leakey saw as the originator of human technology . Since the initial discovery , specimens of habilis have been found in several other sites in East and South Africa , dating from between two and one and a half million years ago . Only half as old as Lucy , habilis had a somewhat bigger brain . But brain size is at best a very rough indicator of intelligence . Habilis 's real claim to inclusion in the same genus as , say , Stephen Hawking , is the manifest ability to manufacture stone tools  --  crude , chunky things ( collectively known as the Oldowan Industry ) , but tools nonetheless . // In the late 1960s , habilis 's toolmaking skills became the centerpiece of a seductive new theory of human origins . What really set the human career in motion , said the theory 's proponents , was not bipedalism , toolmaking , or brain growth in itself , but the uniquely human activity that inspired these innovations : the cooperative hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible by tools , but it is far more than a technique or even a variety of techniques , " wrote Sherwood Washburn and C. S. Lancaster in Man the Hunter , in 1968 . " It is a way of life , and the success of this adaptation . . . has dominated the course of evolution for hundreds of thousands of years . In a very real sense our intellect , interests , emotions and basic social life-all are evolutionary products of the success of the hunting adaptation . " // As the first toolmaker , habilis was naturally seen as the first full-fledged human hunter as well . In the next decade , the " all-importance " of the species was further enhanced by a theory put forth by Glynn Isaac of Berkeley and widely popularized by his colleague in the field , Richard Leakey . The Leakeys ' excavations in East Africa had uncovered several sites where smashed-up mammal bones bearing the cut marks of stone tools were found scattered among the tools themselves . Isaac concluded that these accumulations were the remains of hominid " home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hunt to be butchered and shared among members of their social unit . If he was right  --  and thanks to Leakey 's best-sellers , Isaac 's food-sharing hypothesis rapidly took on the luster of historical truth  --  then nearly two million years ago , our ancestors had already developed the social pattern of nuclear families that characterizes virtually all modern human societies . // " The humanness of our ancestors goes considerably further back than Neandertal and probably will go back to the very dawn of culture , " Leakey commented . // Fascinating as these theories were , however , they have not stood up well to new discoveries , or to more rigorous scrutiny of old ones . In 1986 , Donald Johanson 's team at Olduvai Gorge uncovered the first Homo habilis skeleton to include both skull and body parts  --  a combination needed to assess accurately a species ' body proportions . ( I was lucky enough to be involved in the discovery and wrote a book with Johanson about it . ) At three and a half feet , this particular " mighty hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without tools or cooperative hunting strategies , even the males of this first human species hardly seem to have been a formidable presence on a savanna bristling with lions and saber-toothed tigers . Furthermore , the new specimen 's arms were nearly as long as her legs , again resembling Lucy . If functional anatomists like Randall Susman are to be believed , habilis too was spending a lot more time hiding in the trees than loping after terrified prey . // Far from confirming a habiline humanity , the skeleton lent solid support to a less romantic portrait of habilis put forth in the early 1980s , primarily by Lewis Binford , then at the University of New Mexico . Binford looked at the same evidence Isaac had marshaled for his food-sharing hypothesis , but came back with a radically different interpretation . Assemblages of bones and stone tools , such as those at Olduvai Gorge , were not signs of a hunting hominid , but merely jumbles of material thrown together by natural forces , or collected by nonhuman predators like hyenas . Other archaeologists pointed out that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tooth marks of gnawing carnivores . If habilis was involved at all in forming these assemblages , its role was hardly a mighty one : After the real predators had left their kill , the hominids scuttled in to scavenge what scraps remained on the carcass . // " The Olduvai toolmaker was no mighty hunter of beasts , " Binford concluded . " He was the most marginal of scavengers . " // Most archaeologists today would say that Binford went too far in demeaning the abilities of the early hominids . Habilis was probably obtaining meat in its diet through a combination of scavenging and opportunistically capturing small animals . In any case , the species was almost certainly making and using stone tools . To add new insult to injury , however , it now appears that Homo habilis was not the only Handy Man around . // Go back to the side branch veering off the family tree after Lucy , about two and a half million years ago . There you find a series of lumbering , big-jowled creatures , australopithecines like Lucy but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has long been thought that this australopithecine offshoot from the human lineage represents a dimmer-witted alternative to Homo , doomed to extinction by its inferior grade of intelligence and an increasingly specialized diet  --  one that did not include meat . // The robust australopithecines did indeed go extinct , about a million years ago . But not , it now appears , before leaving behind evidence of their ability to make tools . Over the past few years , Robert Brain of the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria , South Africa , has unearthed a number of primitive digging sticks made of bone . These were associated not with habilis fossils but with the remains of the supposedly dim-witted Australopithecus robustus . Together with Susman , Brain has also examined the fossilized fingertips of the species and found that they bear all the evidence of the manual dexterity needed to make and manipulate stone tools . Farther to the north , there were robust australopithecines running around at Olduvai Gorge and other East African sites at the same time as habilis . Who can say for sure now which hominid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // A more damning indictment of the " specialness " of our lineage is the presence of these collateral hominids in the first place , rubbing shoulders with Homo . Twenty years ago , many anthropologists believed that such a thing was theoretically impossible . No more than one hominid species could exist at the same time , let alone at the same time and place . The Single Species Hypothesis , articulated by Milford Wolpoff and Loring Brace at the University of Michigan , was based on a widely accepted ecological principle known as " competitive exclusion " which maintains that in any given environment , multiple species can coexist only if each carves out a separate " niche " for itself , exploiting its own particular range of resources . If two species compete too closely for the same food and other resources  --  in other words , try to squeeze into the same ecological niche  --  one of them will quickly drive the other into extinction . // According to the Single Species Hypothesis , the unique niche hominids carved for themselves was culture . Today no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the same must have been true in the past . If any other species attempted to occupy this niche , it would have been outcompeted by the one hominid filling the niche at any given point in the past . In effect , the hominid lineage was a club so exclusive it could accommodate only one member at a time . // " Because of this hominid-adaptive characteristic implemented by culture , it is unlikely that different hominid species could have been maintained , Wolpoff wrote in 1971. // Thomas Huxley , an early supporter of Charles Darwin , said that the great tragedy of science was " the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact . " Through the 1970s , the beautiful Single Species Hypothesis was picked away at by a steady stream of ugly little facts coming out of the fossil-rich regions of East Africa . The credibility of the theory depended upon seeing all anatomical variation in hominid fossils at any given time in the past as simply the natural differences between the various populations of a single species . With all kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny brains , others with larger brains but thin skull bones and far less robust faces  --  it became increasingly obvious that there were at least two species of hominid sharing the African savanna around two million years ago . // In 1975 , when Richard Leakey 's team discovered an advanced , large-brained skull of Homo erectus dating to 1.6 million years ago  --  a time when the relatively small-brained Australopithecus boisei was also surely alive  --  the single-species hypothesis came crashing down for good . With it went the sense that our lineage was propelled forward in evolution in a kind of enclosed pneumatic tube , removed from the forces affecting other species . Some scholars , like lan Tattersall at the American Museum of Natural History , argue that there were not two but three or more different branches on the human family bush a million and a half years ago . What could more completely confound the notion of hominid uniqueness than the presence of a multitude of hominid species scurrying over the same landscape ? // " This is probably the most far-reaching conclusion of paleoanthropology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the University of Cambridge , " for it finally brings home the point that human evolution is like that of other species , and there is no single way of being a hominid. " // Among all the contemporary hominids , however , only one would carry forward to the present . After habilis in the time line comes Homo erectus . Between these two , there was perhaps an " all-important " transition . On average , the brains of erectus were about 20 percent larger than those of its predecessor . Their bodies were larger too , probably approaching modern humans in height . Unlike any creature before it , Homo erectus apparently knew bow to tame fire to its own purpose , and with the appearance of erectus , the archaeological record shows the emergence of a much more sophisticated stone-tool industry , known as the Acheulean . Like modern humans , and unlike earlier hominids , Homo erectus males were not overwhelmingly bigger than females . This reduced " sexual dimorphism " may indicate that cooperation among males had begun to replace competition in social interactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization that characterizes human populations today . To lend support to this notion , archaeologists have pointed to erectus sites hundreds of thousands of years old that show the remains of large building structures . Other sites associated with erectus have been interpreted as mass elephant and baboon kills , involving dozens of hunters acting together . // Most important , the old geographical aliases for erectus  --  Peking Man and Java Man  --  bear witness to the fact that this species was the first hominid to be found beyond Africa . The Homo erectus migration out of Africa is well documented . Between one million and 700,000 years ago , ( * ) the species spread across the warm temperate zones of Mediterranean Europe and Asia as far as Indonesia . By 300,000 years ago , it had colonized the arid steppes and colder woodlands to the north , leaving its traces as far as Britain . This expansion into the Northern Hemisphere is the most treasured testimony to its advanced condition . What could be more human , especially from the Western European point of view that forms the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and harsher habitats ? // Impressive as this first human diaspora was , however , it was not unique . Alan Turner of the University of Liverpool has shown that as erectus emerged from Africa , other , nonhuman species were making exactly the same trek , including lions , leopards , hyenas , and wolves , pushed forward by ecological imperatives that have nothing to do with intelligence . Either we have to award these fellow travelers the same merit badge in colonization that we pin on erectus , or we must concede that this hominid , like its predecessors , was not governed by any particularly human destiny , but was instead responding , much like other large carnivores , to a shift in , environmental conditions . Meanwhile , in the last decade , virtually all the evidence for complex living structures , cooperative hunting , and even the controlled use of fire by erectus has been reexamined and called into question , if not outright refuted. // There is also the matter of erectus 's tools . The predecessors ' stone tools were little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In contrast , erectus made a variety of more laboriously produced implements , typified by the symmetrical Acheulean hand ax . These beautiful teardrops of quartz or flint enter the archaeological record as early as a million and a half ears ago , along with the first signs of erectus skulls and skeletons . The trouble  --  from an " all-important " standpoint  --  is that the species then goes right on making the same hand axes and other tool types for the next million years . From this point of view , the whole Acheulean period associated with erectus represents not the arrival of a rich and resilient intelligence but , as one archaeologist has called it , a period of " unimaginable monotony. " // " It boggles my mind that I can go all over the world in this huge time frame , and all of these guys are making the same damn thing in the same damn way , " says Tim White of the University of California , Berkeley . " Nothing happens for hundreds and hundreds of thousands of years . And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . One thing you can count on about humans . They change . "
