If you 're a scientist closing in on a major discovery , you may want to slow down some . Bungle an experiment , perhaps ; muddy up a study . Tempting as it might be to finish this project and get on to the next one , it 's possible there wo n't be a next one , because science , as we know it , may be through . After centuries of breakthroughs in every field from astronomy to zoology , science may have rendered itself superfluous . Sure , we may have years of work ahead tidying up the details . But while that 's important , is it science ? Maybe not . Maybe true science  --  the capital-S science practiced by Galileo and Copernicus  --  is behind us . <P> That 's the premise behind The End of Science ( Addison-Wesley ; $24 ) , the controversial new book by John Horgan , a senior writer for Scientific American . While many scientists dismiss his theory as unworthy of discussion , discuss it they have , heatedly challenging Horgan 's work and defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory makes a degree of sense . Science is usually an incremental enterprise , with most researchers toiling in the experimental thickets , trying to hack out a little clearing of enlightenment . Occasionally , however , a Darwin or Einstein comes along and with a flash of insight as blinding as a thermonuclear airburst , clears the entire landscape . Down below , ordinary scientists blink disbelievingly at their sudden ability to see from horizon to horizon . But their sense of wonder is tempered by regret . Tending your tiny patch seems like pulling weeds compared with such intellectual clear cutting . <P> Nevertheless , Horgan argues that this wholesale defoliation is just about complete . His points are well made , but two major counterpoints remain . <P> The first is that we 've heard all this before . In every century , people have concluded that theirs was the most enlightened of all times and that any scientific questions not currently answered might never be . In this century , however , maybe it 's finally true . Once you 've unleashed the power of the atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and matter becomes a settled question . Big ideas like quantum physics and the structure of DNA have been established just as conclusively . <P> But simply because science has checked off some of the boxes on its existential-questions list does not mean it has checked them all . What was going on before the Big Bang ? Astronomers have some ideas , but little more . What are the most basic subatomic particles ? Physicists suggest they 're tiny 10-dimensional objects called superstrings , but nobody has shown that these really exist . Horgan claims that such questions are less science than they are philosophy because we ca n't test them . But that wo n't necessarily always be so . Aristotle could n't have conceived of the Hubble Space Telescope ; what makes Horgan think we can imagine the scientific equipment of the year 4000 ? <P> Meanwhile there are plenty of questions to address right now . Barely 10% of the matter in the universe has ever been found ; the rest remains a mystery . Biologists understand the structure of DNA , but that no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals the identity of Guglielmo Marconi . These and other big questions may yet be solved .
