Every artist needs some source of inspiration . Max Ernst , the lyric German subversive who was born 100 years ago , had one that carried him through most of his life . He hated his father , a pious Catholic art teacher who worked in a school for deaf and mute children in a small forest town south of Cologne . Indeed , Ernst wanted to kill Papa and what he thought he represented : the authority of age , religion , the state and the image . <P> At six , little Oedipus Max , the future Dadaist , had a dream , an obsessive vision : " I see in front of me a panel crudely painted with large black strokes on a red ground , imitating the grain of mahogany . . . In front of this panel a black and shiny man is making slow , comic and joyously obscene gestures . This strange fellow has the mustache of my father . . . He smiles and takes out of the pocket of his trousers a large pencil made of some soft material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black lines on the panel of false mahogany . He quickly gives it new , surprising and despicable forms . " <P> New , surprising , despicable  --  not a bad thumbnail note for Ernst 's own art , especially as seen by others . We have reason to thank the large soft pencil of the man with the mustache . Ernst was not a great formal artist , not by a very long chalk . But in the 1920s and ' 30s especially , he was a brilliant maker of images . Their strength and edginess radiate like new in the centenary Ernst exhibit , organized by art historian Werner Spies , which is at London 's Tate Gallery this month and moves in mid-May to Stuttgart 's Staatsgalerie . Long after the art movements to which Ernst contributed have passed into history , his images continue to detonate in the mind like unexploded land mines left on the old battlefield of modernism . If the young love Dada and Surrealism , and early Ernst in particular , it is because of his healthy desire to murder Papa 's culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means simply " gluing . " Ernst cut photos and engravings from magazines , catalogs , albums , marrying things that / did n't belong together . Collage was a static relative of film cutting , then in its infancy . Seventy years later , America sees in collage because it grew up spinning the TV dial . No such fragmentation of images was built into the culture of France or Germany in the 1920s . The relations between image and thing seemed solid . Here was something to overturn , and collage was the lever . Ernst fell on the common vein of reproductory images like a miner discovering a virgin reef . <P> Essentially untrained as a painter , he fell in with the German Expressionists in 1910-12 by sheer brightness of character . He knew August Macke , whose ideas about pantheistic nature were to reverberate in Ernst 's work right up to its end . Macke was killed in the trenches . Ernst survived the war and emerged from its troglodytic lunacy with a deep hatred of Kaiser and country .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
