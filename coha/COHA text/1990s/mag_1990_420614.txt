Section : INVESTING From troubled waters ( for Exxon ) to full steam ahead ( for AT &T; and Wal-Mart ) : That 's the outlook for the six biggest stocks in the wake of the oil shock . <p> The U.S. stock market has been one of the early casualties in the Mideast war of nerves . Surging oil prices , fear of inflation and the cold breath of recession have inflicted damage on all stocks , most notably , however , on small-company issues as opposed to big household names owned by the largest number of investors . From the market top on July 16 , small stocks as measured by the NASDAQ over-the-counter index sank 23% to their low on Aug. 23 before recovering slightly by early September . Meanwhile , the 30 blue chips that make up the Dow Jones industrial average dropped t7% before bouncing back to show a recent loss of 13% . <p> If you own big-company stocks or if you have been thinking about buying one  --  and that 's just about everybody  --  you probably are wondering what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wail Street analysts and economists to review the prospects for the Big Six , the six largest American companies on the New York Stock Exchange ranked by total market value-ranging from $62 billion down to $33 billion . Analysts turned out to be surprisingly positive about these stocks as a group  --  Exxon , IBM , General Electric , Philip Mortis , AT &T; and Wal-Mart . The consensus : most are bargains today . That 's good news to the prospective buyers . And it 's not necessarily bad news for the nearly 5 million investors who own the Big Six , which represent about 13% of the total market value of Standard &; Poor 's index of 500 stocks . <p> Many stock analysts believe that even though we are in a bear market ( commonly defined as a decline in stock prices of 15% or more ) , giants like these six will suffer less and recover sooner than their smaller counterparts . Their solid edge is their capacity to offset lost business at home with growth overseas . " As a U.S. recession seems likelier , investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says William LeFevre , market strategist for the regional brokerage Advest . " And most of the Dow stocks are multinationals . " True , oil prices in the present $25 to $28 range will slow growth in Europe and the Far East by half a percentage point or so in inflation-adjusted terms . Still , many analysts believe those economies , which were showing fewer signs of weakness than the U.S. before the Mideast troubles , will grow at about a 3% annual rate  --  assuming a shooting war does n't destroy oil production facilities and send prices soaring to $40 or $50 a barrel . <p> Economic uncertainties may in fact prompt cautious investors to reorder their investment portfolios , particularly the money earmarked for college , retirement and family security . ( For advice on what smart moves to make to protect yourself against tough economic times , see the story on page 74 ) . Higher oil prices increase the chances that corporate profits could fall as much as 5% next year . <p> Investors who try to switch in and out of stocks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have not sold out by now . On , the other hand , if you expect a shooting war you still could protect yourself by selling at least a third of your Stocks and moving to money-market funds or long-term bonds ( see Money Forecast on page 19 ) . Long-term investors who shun sudden switches may want to hold on to their big-company stocks while trimming back smaller holdings and increasing safer investments such as money-market funds and Treasuries of three years ' maturity or less . By contrast , contrarians or venturesome investors who do not mind buying stocks when others are selling may spot some bargains , especially among the biggest stocks . For instance , Wal-Mart , already down 20% from its peak price , routinely improves its competitive position during recessions , analysts say . <p> Still , any investors tempted to buy cheap now should remember that bear markets can last a year or more , so it takes patience to realize gains . Bargain hunters may see the stocks they buy fall another 5% or more before reviving . Therefore , hedge your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead , buy in stages over the next few months . <p> Here is a closer look at the six biggest American companies , listed here in order of market capitalization ( the number of shares times the price ) . We have included analysts ' recommendations about whether you , as a long-term investor , should buy , sell or simply hold each of the six . The chart below presents additional data , including three-year target prices , price/earnings ratios and dividend yields . EXXON : HOLD <p> It may come as a shock to the oil-obsessed , but Exxon is the only one of our Big Six that does not rate a buy recommendation . The stock 's biggest gains from higher oil prices may well be behind it , and the lingering liability problems from the 1989 Alaskan oil spill by the Exxon Valdez are a further depressant . For those who already own the stock , however , the high 4.8% , dividend yield may be reason enough to hold on . <p> Since the Iraqi army moved into Kuwait , oil prices have risen about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long waiting game in the Mideast that could halt both the oil price spiral and the oil stocks spiral . If no shooting war breaks out , increased production by OPEC countries could flatten world prices at around $25 a barrel . " A military standoff will likely bring oil production increases in Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela of about 2.5 million barrels a day , or 30% above their normal levels . Then prices should moderate as the panic psychology eases , " says analyst Frank Knuettel of Prudential-Bache . <p> Even investors who want to bet on increasing oil company profits would do better to buy another stock . " Instead of Exxon , we would recommend a company like Texaco , " says analyst Michael Young of Smith Barney . Young projects annual earnings gains of 15% over the next three years for Texaco compared with 10% for Exxon . Since its recent low point July 10 , Exxon stock has risen 7% to its recent $50 a share . That 7% is higher than the rate of increase analysts expect in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Exxon 's stock price could flatten out in the coming months . <p> Furthermore , lawsuits still loom from the Valdez oil spill . Some claims have been settled , but a federal indictment handed down in February could result in judgments costing $600 million to $700 million  --  equal to about 15% of Exxon 's estimated profit this year . " This cloud will continue to hold over Exxon for some time , " says analyst Fred Leuffer of stock research firm C.J. Lawrence . Exxon also revealed recently that it may have to pay the Internal Revenue Service $6.5 billion in back taxes for the years 1980-82  --  although the company 's lawyers are disputing the sum in Tax Court . IBM : Buy <p> A brand-new generation of powerful mainframe computers , IBM 's meal ticket , will help boost profits by about 10% next year . That plus the stock 's 18% drop from its latest price peak on July 16 have drawn a chorus of buy recommendations from analysts . But what about investor concerns that networks of smaller computers will replace mainframes for traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IBM 's new strategy  --  fitting its mainframes into networks and developing competitive smaller computers of its own  --  has brightened Big Blue 's profit outlook , analysts say . <p> While IBM 's seven new System 390 mainframes were announced on Sept. 5 , the two most powerful ones will not be available until the fall of 1991 . That has led some analysts to worry that mainframe sales  --  which with related products provide more than half of IBM 's profits  --  will drop off until the new models are ready . A survey of current IBM mainframe users taken in early August by research firm Sanford C. Bernstein &; Co. , however , found that neither recession fears nor the wait for new machines was affecting spending plans for IBM mainframes . Bernstein analyst Don Young predicts that the machines will attract about $1.5 billion in sales by the end of 1991 from airlines , banks , retailers and other customers who need to replace their large systems . <p> Although no longer the technological juggernaut of earlier decades , IBM still has many advantages over its competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . With the introduction of its RS/6000 model this year , IBM finally appears capable of being competitive in work stations-high-powered units used by engineers and other technical workers . That is a crucial step . Sales of work stations and personal computers , which are increasingly linked in office networks , are expected to grow 10% to 15% annually over the next few years . And if IBM 's overall earnings grow about 10% a year , its stock could move from a recent $104 a share to $140 within three years  --  a 35% increase . GENERAL ELECTRIC : Buy <p> With its wide range of businesses , GE is well positioned around the globe to ride out a U.S. recession with ease . For example , about 40% of its profits were generated overseas last year . With the stock down 16% from its July 19 top , analysts are recommending it to investors . Nomura Research Institute of America analyst David Gardner expects accelerated demand for commercial jet engines , which contributed 15% of profits in 1989 , for plastics ( about 15% ) and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worries . For example , despite the military mobilization in the Mideast , Gardner sees potential problems ahead resulting from pending Pentagon cutbacks for GE 's jet fighter engine business and other military projects , which contributed nearly 20% of GE 's 1989 profits . The company 's NBC TV network , which accounted for about 8% of profits in 1.989 , could bring in less if its prime-time shows fail to continue dominating the top 10 ratings . <p> Nonetheless , says analyst Michael Bunyaner of Oppenheimer &; Co. , GE is likely to post 12% to 15% annual earnings growth over the next three years . That could push the stock price from its recent $63 a share to around $100 , predicts Gardner . PHILIP MORRIS : Buy <p> More and more local ordinances ban smoking in public places . A recent New Jersey Supreme Court decision may open the floodgates to suits charging tobacco companies with liability for smokers ' deaths and illnesses . Yet Philip Morris zips along the profit trail with no slowdown in sight . The company is a leader in three business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco , food and beer . Says analyst Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch : " The stock is a great long-term buy . " <p> Although 50% of profits still come from U.S. cigarette sales , Philip Morris has diversified well . It owns Miller Brewing and such well-known trademarks as Velveeta , Miracle Whip , Sanka and many more it acquired when it bought General Foods and Kraft during the 1980s . A recent agreement to buy Swiss-based Jacobs Suchard for $3.8 billion will also make Philip Morris the market leader in coffee in both West Germany and France . Sales abroad provided 30% of sales before the Suchard acquisition ; now that number is expected to rise to 35% . <p> Higher cigarette taxes would hurt . For example , an expected doubling of federal excise taxes could cut the earnings growth rate of its domestic brands by two percentage points to about 10% over the next three years . Although international tobacco profits , growing a robust 17% , would help offset U.S. declines , lingering doubts about tobacco 's future have held down the Philip Morris price/earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13.7 for the S &P; 500 . <p> Undaunted , analyst Kaplan believes that Philip Morris will post 20% annual earnings increases over the next three years and raise dividends by at least that much . If the stock appreciates in line with the company 's earnings growth , its price could hit $80 , up from a recent $45 , in three years . AT &T:; Buy <p> When it comes to long-distance investing , AT &T; has the right numbers . Even an earnings stumble earlier this year has not stopped analysts from recommending the stock for the long term . The 20% price drop since the company warned on June 27 that second-quarter earnings would be below last year 's figure has provided a buying opportunity . " Long-term investors should be very interested and think about buying , " says analyst Charles Nichols II of Prudential-Bache . Nichols believes AT &T; will continue to defend its 65% share of the lucrative long-distance telephone service market successfully against US Sprint and MCI . That 's crucial because long-distance service , which provides about 90% of AT &T's; pretax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be slowed by a recession . Still , Nichols notes that while industry growth in long-distance sales dropped by 3% in a recent 12-month period , AT &T; reported a 7% gain  --  up from 5% for a comparable period a year earlier . <p> AT &T's; lower second-quarter numbers resulted from sluggish computer and telephone equipment sales . The company was also hurt by high start-up costs for its hot new Universal credit card ( MONEY , September ) . But , says analyst Gregory Sawers of Sanford C. Bernstein , that bodes well for the future : the 2 million customers who signed up after tight credit screening are double the number AT &T; expected . " That means the credit card should be profitable by 1994 , about one year faster than planned , " he adds . Sawers and Nichols both believe that after this year , AT &T; can resume hitting its target of 10% to 12% annual earnings growth . That could raise the stock price from a recent $33 a share to around $60 within three years , adds Nichols . WAL-MART STORES : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s still has plenty of promise left for the 1990s . Wal-Mart , which rose an average of 45% a year in the past decade , could double to around $58 in three years , says Edward Johnson , director of the Johnson Redbook Service , a research firm specializing in retailing . Even a recession that shrinks retail industry profits by 4% might be a long-term plus for Wal-Mart . Sales increases at its existing Wal-Mart stores might cut its current 8% annual rate in half , says Edward Comeau of Oppenheimer &; Co . But Wal-Mart would make up for that by gaining market share in both its Wal-Mart stores and the markets called Sam 's Wholesale Clubs . Such gains are likely to make Wal-Mart the second biggest U.S. retailer , behind Sears , during 1991 . Wal-Mart will boost market share by spending $1.7 billion a year on new stores and renovations while many strapped competitors slash their capital expenditures . Adds Johnson : " Wal-Mart is a steamroller . " <p> Unlike the other Big Six companies , Wal-Mart has no foreign operations . Its 1,650 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand in this country . Thus far its stores are in 29 states concentrated in the South and Midwest . So the Northwest , Southwest , California and the Northeast are all virgin territory . Comeau sees Wal-Mart earnings rising an average of 22.5% annually over the next five years . <p> The other plus for new investors is that Wal-Mart stock  --  the only one of the six not numbered among the Dow industrials  --  already has dropped 20% from its high on July 16 . At $29 , Comeau rates it a buy , despite its lofty P/E ratio of 24.4  --  some 56% above the general market . The stock could drop another 15% or so over the next two months , Comeau concedes , but he adds : " Institutional investors , Wal-Mart employees and other investors have such an incredible loyalty to this company , I think they will support the price . " Big profits for the Big Six <p> These six superstocks promise an average price increase of 63% by 1993 , according to analysts who estimated the companies future prices . Top prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( up 82% ) and Wal-Mart ( up 100% ) . P/E ratios are based on 1990 estimates .
