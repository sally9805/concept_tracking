<p> Michael Robert Milken will stand this morning before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood to be sentenced for his financial crimes . <p> The fallen junk-bond king faces 28 years in prison on the six felonies he admitted to in April . Prosecutors have called for more , arguing Milken 's crimes go far beyond those six . Milken has contritely asked for community service , pointing to his charitable works and his family . <p> Based on past cases , Wall Street is betting Milken will draw four to six years in jail . But Milken , a towering and puzzling figure , has galvanized public opinion far beyond Wall Street : It sometimes seems half the country wants to put him up for sainthood and the other half wants to put him on a gallows . <p> What sentence does Milken deserve ? USA TODAY reporters Beth Belton and Paul Wiseman asked that of more than 100 prominent people , from Wall Street lions to celebrities who 've had their own scrapes with the law : <p> Connie Bruck : Columnist , The New Yorker ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heyday . <p> " Common wisdom is that it needs to be more than ( the three years ) Ivan Boesky ( got ) . What Milken did was so much more significant than what Boesky did . It 's really rank hypocrisy that ( Milken ) accepted no responsibility for what he did . He said he erred for his clients and that was so much not the case . That made me angry . ... He should get a substantial prison sentence . " <p> Zsa Zsa Gabor : Actress , convicted of slapping a police officer . <p> " I think it 's terrible what he has done . Sentence ? I do n't know about the sentence because of course I was sentenced for doing nothing . I know that it 's terrible that he sold those junk bonds to little old ladies . He should have tried to sell junk bonds to Mr. ( Charles ) Keating . Then everybody would have been happy . " <p> John Bogle : Chairman , Vanguard Group of mutual funds . <p> " He deserves a jail sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should certainly get something more than a slap on the wrist - more than two or three years . Maybe eight to 10 years would be appropriate . ... We 've been too far lenient on white-collar crime in this country . It 's high time that the people with all the advantages paid penalties comparable to those paid by people with all the disadvantages . " <p> Gail Hessol : Managing director/credit analysis , Standard &; Poor 's Corp .. <p> " I was n't sure whether he 's a victim or a villain . It would appear correct to say he 's a little of each . It appears that some crimes were committed . His original notion that junk bonds were undervalued and that the risk was less than some people said - that was valid . It got carried to excess . ... I have no knowledge of what normal sentencing is or is n't . I 'm a credit analyst , not a criminal lawyer . Was he overzealously prosecuted ? I ca n't answer that . The zeal was in the regulator 's response . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DJs . WKRC , New York : <p> " I do n't think he should go to prison . I think we should put him back on the job because he 's the only one capable of making junk bonds work . It 's Neil Bush , the president 's son , who should be in jail . " <p> F. Lee Bailey : Trial lawyer . <p> " One can predict he will get somewhere in the vicinity of two to three years . Why ? Past experience and some familiarity with the whole business - the fact the case against him is not the strongest in the world - is why . The fact that the forfeiture ( of $ 600 million Milken paid ) was very substantial will help . Prison can be as counterproductive as productive in these cases . The only value is to deter others . But deterrence has never been terribly effective in white-collar crime or insider trading . " <p> Robert Sobel : Business historian , professor , Hofstra University . <p> " He should be sentenced to five years as U.S. secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd do a hell of a better job than anyone else in the United States . He pled guilty to crimes that ordinarily five to six years ago would have resulted in just a fine - and a minor fine at that . It 's very unfair . The government ... engaged in blackmail . Prosecutors said , ' We 'll drop charges against your brother if you plead guilty . ' Saddam Hussein is not the only person to hold hostages . The U.S. Justice Department does , too . By doing all this , the government knocked the hell out of the junk-bond market . If Milken were around , there 'd be a market for ( junk bonds ) . We may be on the verge of a financial panic and it 's all because ... the government was trying to find a scapegoat . " <p> Arnold Jacob Wolf : Rabbi , Isaiah Israel Congregation , Chicago . <p> " The more years the merrier . Milken is a terrible person who deserves a horrible punishment . He betrayed widows and orphans , which is against Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profaned the name of God in public and he surrendered to the worst of the yuppie values . ... I hope he goes to jail for a very long time . " <p> Ronny Cox : Star of Cop Rock . <p> " I do n't care if he goes to jail or not , but all the money he made should be returned . He should not be allowed to make one dime or profit in any way for the rest of his life from the crime he has committed . " <p> Denny McLain : Former pitcher for baseball 's Detroit Tigers , now a radio talk-show host . Spent 29 months in prison on loan sharking and racketeering charges . <p> " He has paid a $ 600 million fine . I do n't believe there 's a useful purpose in putting the guy in jail . There 's a degree of humiliation . ... If he 's as compassionate a guy as people say he is , this has to be killing him . ... If I were the judge , I would put him on probation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money away from him - leave him with what he had when he got started . There 's nothing more cruel than that . " <p> Benjamin Stein : Economist , lawyer , actor , Barron 's contributor . <p> " Five to 10 years would make sense if Milken were only guilty of the six crimes he 's pleaded guilty to . But ... he 's probably the most successful master criminal of the last century . ... This is a guy who has taken a few thousand dollars from about every family in America . It is the genius of the man and his publicists to have given the impression that that these are victimless crimes . ... If he had gone into every house in a small town and robbed every family at gunpoint , there would be no question ( about a harsh sentence ) . ... He should have a life sentence without possibility of parole . " <p> Moira Johnston : Financial journalist , author of Takeover . <p> " The punishment should match the monumental scale of his arrogance and amorality . Community service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of real jail . My children are watching and the world is watching this final act of the 1980s morality play .
