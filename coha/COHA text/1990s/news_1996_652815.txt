<p> YOU KNOW THEM . The minute they show up on screen you recognize their faces , those wonderfully expressive yet Everyman faces that make such an indelible imprint on the celluloid landscape . You ca n't recall their names , but you 're positive you 've seen them before  --  and you probably have . <p> The actor who played the bullying Marine sergeant in " Full Metal Jacket "  --  was n't he the same one who played the outraged father in " Dead Man Walking " and the married conventioneer who rebuffs Elisabeth Shue in " Leaving Las Vegas " ? <p> And did n't the actor who depicted Alicia Silverstone 's gruff but doting dad in " Clueless " also turn up as a harried detective in " The Usual Suspects " and as Bette Midler 's bimbo-besotted ex-husband in " The First Wives Club " ? <p> R. Lee Ermey and Dan Hedaya may not have their names above the title  --  how many moviegoers even know their names ?  --  and their faces have n't decorated the cover of Vanity Fair magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are the nuts and bolts that anchor a film . <p> Along with colleagues like J. T. Walsh , M. Emmet Walsh , Joe Pantoliano , Glenn Plummer , Roma Maffia , Max Perlich , William Forsythe , Lois Smith and Will Patton , they constitute a pantheon of gloriously idiosyncratic characters whom fans remember even while the actors ' names elude them . <p> " I 'm the guy who kissed the girl who kissed the guy who kissed the horse , " said M. Emmet Walsh , 61 , who has appeared in 84 feature films , most recently as the discredited psychiatrist testifying for the defense in " A Time to Kill . " " But when I walk on screen , no one washes me out . I have presence . If I 'm working with Mr. Hackman or Newman or Redford , it becomes a tennis match between us . " <p> A gifted character actor " makes the leading man or lady sweat and do their best work , " said the casting director David Rubin . <p> " They energize a scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's imaginings . " <p> Now that summer 's mass-market blockbusters have given way to more dramatic fare , where actors , not special effects , are the focus , these hard-working scene stealers are popping up in a spate of new and forthcoming movies . <p> Mr. Hedaya , in addition to " The First Wives Club , " will be seen in the Mel Gibson thriller " Ransom , " in " Marvin 's Room , " with Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton , in " Daylight " ( starring Sylvester Stallone ) , in " Freeway " ( a noir thriller with Kiefer Sutherland ) and in " Garden of Redemption , " a World War II drama . <p> Mr. Ermey has meaty roles in " Going West in America , " which stars Danny Glover and Dennis Quaid , and " Prefontaine , " a Disney film about the track star Steve Prefontaine . <p> J. T. Walsh , who recently played an opportunistic senator on a hijacked plane in " Executive Decision , " appears as an asylum inmate in the offbeat independent film " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with Kurt Russell . <p> M. Emmet Walsh plays a bartender in " Albino Alligator " and an apothecary in " Romeo and Juliet . " He recently completed filming " My Best Friend 's Wedding , " in which he plays the father of the groom . <p> Ubiquitous though they may be , these actors are not stars . Fans do n't stampede to a movie because Mr. Ermey is in it . And in an industry that worships youth and beauty , they tend to look more like the rumpled masses strolling the aisles at Sears than Mel Gibson and Michelle Pfeiffer . <p> " If the entire population of a film were glamorous and beautiful , it would n't be reflective of life , " said Mr. Rubin . " The sort of Everyman looks of a character actor are a tremendous asset because they create a specific reality on screen . " <p> Character actors seldom appear throughout a film and are rarely granted long , adoring close-ups . Scripts are n't written for them . Agents do n't fawn over them . Studios do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Giorgio Armani does n't shower them with clothes . <p> Though a few established character actors may get roles without having to undergo the humbling process of auditioning , their work life is sporadic : a part may take several weeks to shoot or be over in a day . <p> Once character actors shine in certain roles  --  the thug , the psychopath , the detective or the buddy  --  they have difficulty breaking out of that niche . Actresses , for whom starring roles are scarce , have even more trouble finding dynamic character parts <p> " There is n't a dearth of actresses out there ; there 's a lack of lively , meaningful roles , " said Ms. Smith , who appears in " Dead Man Walking , " " Twister " and the new Bill Murray comedy , " Larger Than Life , " which opens on Friday . " I 've been fortunate in these recent years , but in general , there are far more available parts for character men than character women . " <p> Even the term " character actor " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RESENTED BEING called a character actor in New York , but with the caste system they have in Hollywood , you feel the little sting of it , " said J. T. Walsh . " There is a distinction made between the person who is getting $20 million and everyone else . " <p> On the other hand , character actors will never suffer the ignominy of being the subject of " Whatever Happened to . . . ? " articles . They do n't need bodyguards to accompany them to the corner deli , and they do n't shoulder the blame if a movie bombs . Sought-after character actors can earn a comfortable living  --  in the low-to-mid six figures and higher  --  and usually have longer careers than stars whose shelf life expires when their looks fade . <p> " When you 're not one of those whom God has picked out of the lottery , you have to work harder at your craft , " observed the director Ron Shelton . " But frequently you 're the more interesting actor . And you 're probably healthier emotionally than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Even if they are anxiety-ridden egomaniacs , supporting players do n't dare throw their weight around on a movie set . Maybe a star can be difficult , but a character actor with an attitude problem has very limited employment prospects . <p> " You do n't go in and ask for rewrites , that 's for sure , " said J. T. Walsh , 52 , chuckling at the idea . " You 're the one directors know they do n't have to worry about , so they can turn their attention to more pressing problems , like finding the star a bigger trailer . " <p> Mr. Ermey put it more succinctly . " You 're prepared , you deliver the goods and you do n't give people a hard time , " he said . <p> Mr. Ermey , 52 , is a leathery-looking ex-marine who got his start almost 20 years ago as a technical adviser on the film " The Boys in Company C. " The director was so impressed watching him teach an actor how to be a drill instructor that he dismissed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ermey got stuck for years playing military parts . <p> " I was typecast so severely , " he said . " For a long time I had to take what was thrown at me . Finally , a few years ago , I put my foot down and told my manager , ' No more military roles . ' " <p> When he was offered the part of the anguished father in " Dead Man Walking , " he leaped at the opportunity to be liberated from his khakis  --  even though he got paid scale . " I 'd have done the damn role for free , because it was a great career move , " he said . " It gave me an opportunity to really show my wares . " <p> MR . HEDAYA , 56 , WHO played his share of detectives and blue-collar workers , got his chance to redefine himself with a hilarious comic turn as a rich Beverly Hills lawyer who indulges his teen-age daughter in " Clueless . " <p> The role not only propelled him up the career ladder but brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the street by name , instead of yelling , as one did , " Hey , man of a thousand faces ! " <p> " It took time for people 's scales to fall off their eyes in Hollywood , but I 'm now given the opportunity for diverse roles , " said Mr. Hedaya , who has just begun shooting " A Life Less Ordinary , " directed by Danny Boyle , the director of " Trainspotting . " <p> " I feel blessed , " Mr. Hedaya said . <p> Really ? Is n't it frustrating to be always the supporting player , never the star ? Does n't he hunger for recognition and celebrity ? <p> " I 'm not frustrated , " he insisted . " I know actors who are truly gifted , and the business has not been as kind to them . I feel very thankful for what is going on . " <p> Indeed , for many character actors who have spent years scrounging for bit parts , it is reward enough to be constantly employed , playing bigger , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said J. T. Walsh , whose words were echoed by others . <p> Yet as one studio casting director put it : " I do n't think anybody wakes up and says , ' Gee , I 'd like to be a character actor . ' You just kind of end up there . " <p> So how does a character actor vault from supporting roles to leads ? How does one go from anonymous stalwart to star , as Gene Hackman , Kathy Bates and Morgan Freeman did ? <p> " It 's opportunity , timing , talent and the right role in the right movie , " said the producer Scott Rudin . " It 's that one breakthrough role that gives them the bounce . Tommy Lee Jones before ' The Fugitive ' is not Tommy Lee Jones as he is today . That was an incredible part in a gigantic hit movie that made people suddenly say : ' Wow ! Tommy Lee Jones can hold the center of a film . ' That can happen for any of these people . " <p> FIFTY OR SO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when studios churned out more than 50 films apiece annually , there was less urgency about snaring that one breakthrough part because there were gemlike roles galore for character actors . <p> Sydney Greenstreet , Peter Lorre , George Sanders , Una Merkel and Edward Everett Horton became stars in their own right . They turned up in film after film ( albeit often in the same generic role ) , thanks to long-term contracts that guaranteed them steady work . <p> Today 's supporting players do n't have such job security . What 's more , as stars ' salaries skyrocket , character actors are often asked to take pay cuts . And their roles , as J. T. Walsh put it , " do n't have much meat on the bone . " <p> Increasingly , character actors are turning to television series for both steady employment and highly visible , well-written roles . <p> " The carrot of making a lot of money is a big thing for them because they 've spent so many years struggling , " said Sam Gores , a partner in Paradigm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in the television drama " N.Y.P.D. Blue . " " Some are hoping for a long-run series so they can put away their retirement money . " <p> J. T. Walsh readily admits that " job security " induced him to take a role as a naval officer on NBC 's sci-fi drama " Dark Skies . " <p> Ms. Maffia , who won recognition for her role as the acerbic feminist lawyer representing Michael Douglas in " Disclosure , " turns up this season on a forensic investigative team in the NBC drama " Profiler " and Mr. Pantoliano plays a crazed hood in the CBS drama " EZ Streets . " ( Mr. Pantoliano also appears as a gangster in " Bound , " which opened this month . ) <p> Stanley Tucci , whose screen roles included the assassin stalking Julia Roberts in " The Pelican Brief , " won critical acclaim last season for his portrayal of a devious mogul in Steven Bochco 's court drama " Murder One . " Unwilling to be stuck forever playing the heavy , Mr. Tucci took it upon himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a modest movie that recently opened to glowing reviews . <p> Similarly , Steve Buscemi , who developed a cult following in edgy independent films like " Reservoir Dogs , " " Pulp Fiction " and " Fargo , " made his directorial debut earlier this month in " Trees Lounge , " an examination of suburban blue-collar life which he wrote and , fittingly starred in . <p> For most character actors , however , developing their own movies with their own tailor-made leading roles is the stuff that dreams are made on . More realistically , most character actors ' goal is just to keep working , whether it 's in bread-and-butter parts or in that sparks-flying role that will change their careers . <p> " It does n't come overnight , that 's for sure , " said Mr. Ermey . " You just have to keep working hard and get lucky . In this business , luck has a lot to do with everything . "
