<p> I 've seen Martin Scorsese 's movie of " Casino " and I 've read Nick Pileggi 's book , and what I want to know is , why are these people all still alive ? Scorsese and Pileggi I understand : They 're civilians . But how did Frank ( Lefty ) Rosenthal , the hero of the film and book , survive to tell his story to Pileggi ? How come he 's enjoying retirement in Boca Raton when by all the odds ( which nobody knew more about than he did ) , he should be pushing up cactuses ? <p> " Casino , " which is being released simultaneously as Scorsese 's film and Pileggi 's book , tells the more or less true story of Rosenthal , the man who brought sports book betting to Las Vegas in the 1970s , and managed the Stardust at a time when a suitcase full of large bills was being dispatched on a weekly basis from that casino to the Kansas City mob , and then distributed to lucky Mafioso in Chicago , Milwaukee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real name in the book and becomes Ace Rothstein in the somewhat fictionalized movie ( which opens Nov. 22 ) , was a Chicago bookmaker who was a genius at picking winners and figuring all of the odds having to do with gambling . He was also , on the evidence of the two " Casinos , " a competent manager and visionary businessman who presided over four Vegas casinos during the 1970s and succeeded , during his stewardship , in creating such a disaster that by the end of the decade , the mob had lost control of its Vegas casinos , and its aging bosses , who had counted on a placid and affluent old age , were being hauled before grand juries in several states . <p> " It was the last time street guys would ever be given such an opportunity , " the film 's narrator sadly observes . The era when casinos were financed by the mob-connected Teamster pension funds came to an end , and in the 1980s , a new source of funding was invented : junk bonds , championed by a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars of " Casino II . " <p> What brought everything crashing down around Lefty Rosenthal 's ears were those two virtuous impulses , love and friendship . He fell in love with a high-priced Vegas call girl named Jeri McGee . She did n't want to get married , but he persuaded her with gifts , promises and the belief that they could work out a reasonable arrangement . Meanwhile , his childhood friend from Chicago , Tony Spilotro , journeyed west and gathered a crew of thieves around himself . He set up shop , so it seemed , as the Chicago mob 's local enforcer . <p> He was n't , but everyone thought he was , and every time Lefty 's name appeared in the paper , it was linked with Tony 's . Bad enough  --  but what was worse was that when things went bad between Lefty and Jeri , she turned to Tony for advice , which quickly became sympathy , and before long everyone was being shadowed and bugged by the feds , and there were messy murders and the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book and movie : " We screwed up big time . " <p> Names have been changed in the movie to avoid lawsuits . Robert De Niro plays Ace Rothstein ; Sharon Stone plays his wife Jeri , now called Ginger McKenna , and Joe Pesci plays Tony Spilotro , now known as Nicky Santoro . <p> Meanwhile , the real Lefty Rosenthal lives in comfortable retirement , banned forever from returning to the casinos  --  but alive , which is something , considering that the film opens with a shot of his Cadillac being blown up with him inside . <p> What is fascinating is that Scorsese and Pileggi explain exactly how the mob skimmed millions from the Vegas casinos . How , for example , would you go about stealing a third of the take of a casino 's slot machines ? Consider that you would have to rig the machines , and the coin scales in the locked counting room , which casino officials are not allowed to enter  --  and then you 'd be talking about tons of coins . What would the boys in Kansas City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank 's drive-up window with a forklift ? <p> The explanation , which is brilliant , appears in an early passage of Scorsese 's film , which uses voice-over narration for much of its first hour and plays like an insider 's documentary that could have been called , " How to Steal from a Casino . " In writing his book and the screenplay , Pileggi relied on court testimony and FBI reports , but his prime source of information was Frank Rosenthal himself , who seems to have spoken at great length and frankness about his business and personal life in Las Vegas . <p> " He 's quite a remarkable guy , " Scorsese was telling me not long ago in New York , after an early screening of the film . Throughout our talk , he referred to the characters only by their fictional names , except when I would ask him specifically about Frank Rosenthal : " He 's brilliant at what he does and legally , he 's clear . I mean , he 's been cleared of everything , I think , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Nick means that he 's okay with talking about it . I mean , I 'm sure at times Nick asked him certain things and there was no comment . " <p> In his early days as a bookmaker , according to the book , Rosenthal would place bets only on games or races he was sure of . When friends would pressure him for a pick on a game , his answer , 98 times out of 100 , was " I have no opinion on that . " <p> " That 's what he would tell Nick , " Scorsese said . " I have no opinion on that . " <p> There 's no threat to him from organized crime for talking to Pileggi ? <p> " I do n't think so . I think these things happened in the past and , as Nick says , whatever arrangements had to be made I 'm sure have been made . " <p> Rosenthal has a lot he can be proud of , Scorsese said . " Let 's say the guy does n't kill anybody . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult boss , firing people left and right , but in terms of what he did and how he changed Vegas and opened the first sports book in a casino ... he can be proud . <p> It 's a world and way of life that 's like a microcosm . The movie deals with power and greed and respect and trust and betrayal and that goes on everywhere . It does n't matter if you 're in a village in Outer Mongolia and living in a yurt , or you 're in Vegas or in the Oval Office . The big problem for me is that I had to be as true to them as possible . " <p> The guys . <p> " Those people . Yeah . " <p> Has Rosenthal seen this movie ? <p> " Yes . From what Nick tells me , he liked it . You 're dealing with characters that are ' based ' on real people , you know , and they 're not around to defend themselves . Like the character Nicky Santoro . I think we tried to get both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , you know , he did what he did and that 's his lifestyle . " <p> In the film , both Santoro and his brother , a dentist , meet a horrible death in an Indiana cornfield , being beaten and then buried while still alive . <p> " We could have made short shrift of their deaths , " Scorsese said . " But I did n't feel we should have . I think it was terrible , and sad . He kind of took for everybody . That 's what I think . " <p> How did the gambling industry and Las Vegas itself react to the fact that you were shooting " Casino " there ? <p> " Well , for the most part , they helped us . Steve Wynn ( chief of the " Mirage ' and other major casinos ) helped us a lot . I think they were feeling like this was the past of Vegas , that the city is not that way now . " <p> And the romanticism does n't hurt , I said . When people hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhance the city , in a way . This movie wo n't keep one person away from Vegas . <p> " That may be right . " <p> " People would like to think the slots are n't rigged any more , so they have a better chance . <p> " How do we know ? " said Scorsese . <p> We do n't know . <p> " We do n't know anything . I 'm telling you , it 's just the nature of things . It 's the nature of that kind of thing , that you never know anything . <p> It 's the same in Hollywood . You never know . Who knows where the money goes ? Parts of the budget could be disappearing , for all you know ; people could be siphoning off money . Who knows what 's going on ? " <p> There were some difficulties , Scorsese said . " I do know that when we got a location , I worked out all my shots in a house , for example , got the actors rehearsing in the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Why not ? <p> " In one particular case , there were these old houses , and they 're very hard to find because the houses had to be from the ' 50 's and ' 60 's , you know , and houses that old are all gone in Vegas . We had this terrific house we were working on , and it was on a golf course . A company had bought the houses to tear them down and enlarge the golf course . And suddenly they said , ' We do n't want you shooting here . ' Maybe they did n't want to offend anybody who would later want to play on that course . I do n't know . " <p> Eventually , he said , his production designer found another house , also on a golf course . The golf course was essential to set up one of the funniest scenes in the movie , where FBI agents , conducting aerial reconnaissance on the casino boss , run out of gas and have to make an emergency landing on the golf green right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Scorsese said . " Their plane ran out of gas . <p> In reality , they went into a pond , and they went back to the office soaking wet . " <p> In many of Scorsese 's films , there is a strong undercurrent of male jealousy . " Raging Bull " centers on the insane possessiveness of the boxer Jake LaMotta , and in such earlier films as " Mean Streets , " male characters exhibit what Freud called the Madonna-Whore Complex , in which all women seem like saints while virgins , and irreparably tarnished afterwards . In " Casino , " the Ace Rothstein character does n't exhibit that orientation ; he is n't particularly jealous on a sexual level , does n't have a problem with the fact that Ginger was a hooker , but is " very ( unital ) upset when she insults his intelligence by lying to him and trying to steal from him . <p> That leads to another of the movie 's best scenes , between Robert DeNiro and Sharon Stone . Ginger has taken some of the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longtime pimp and boyfriend , played by James Woods . She claims he spent the money on clothes . Ace feels that his intelligence is being insulted , and in a great verbal riff he explains why the pimp would n't know how to spend that much money on clothes . <p> Scorsese laughed as he recalled the scene , which , he said , was partly improvised by De Niro and Stone . <p> " She gives him the story about $ 25,000 for suits , " he said . " He tells her , ' Look , I ca n't forgive the kidnapping of my kid , but I 'm gon na try to . I can almost forgive the things you 're doing with him and the other guys , whatever 's going on , because I 've got my own things I 'm doing . But when you start to think that I 'm such a fool that I believe $ 25,000 was spent on clothes in 3 or 4 days , then that 's insulting my intelligence . ' That 's the one little extra step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual pride  --  it 's that he 's being taken for a fool . <p> Scorsese nodded . " That 's finally the core of pride there . " Do n't treat me like a john , " he says . ' I know you think I am but I 'm not . ' And that was an improv . And you could see the reaction from Sharon Stone . She 's really something in that . " <p> How much of an improv ? <p> " Most of it . " <p> Like when he starts talking about how much he 'd pay for a suit ... <p> " Oh , that was written . But then he started to go off on how much a watch would cost . He figures the guy would know about a $ 5,000 watch , even a ten or 12 grand watch , but a $ 75,000 watch , that he would n't know about . De Niro started putting that stuff in because he started to work it out mentally . Here is a guy who tries to remain dispassionate , controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him seriously . " <p> In all of your pictures about the mob , from " Mean Streets " to " GoodFellas " to " Casino , " has anyone " from ( unital ) the outfit ever talked to you about them ? <p> " No , I guess , would be the answer . Well , for ' GoodFellas , ' McDonald , who 's the head of the federal task force and plays himself in the film , told me that ' Mean Streets ' was the Task Force 's favorite film . And a guy from the Mafia told Pileggi that ' Mean Streets ' was a film they liked a lot . " <p> Both sides . <p> " Both sides , yeah . That was a big compliment . " He smiled . " And then for ' GoodFellas , ' who 's the guy in Sicily who had 33 people killed in his family ? He said the only film that was accurate about mob life was ' GoodFellas . ' Particularly in the scene where there 's having a good time at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy says , " You think I 'm funny ? " and there 's a sudden burst of violence . He said when something like that happens  --  this is what it 's like in their life . You have to think within a few seconds whether you should kill or you should die . And it 's that simple . " @x THE SIGN OVER THE WEATHER-BEATEN DOOR READS , " Victory Over Darkness . " It 's an attractive idea on a street that holds few lovely things to engage the senses . The building hosts a support center for those determined to exit lives formerly governed by poverty , failure , crime , or addiction . The center is founded on an empowering message from John 's gospel pointing to the only sure route out of human misery . Light has come into the world , John declares , yet we generally prefer the easy darkness . This is because , as bad as darkness can be , it 's personally less demanding of us- at least on the surface . In time the cost of living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do to escape the darkness , John tells us , is to come into the light . With light come clarity , truth , hope , and whole constellations of possibility we ca n't imagine while still wrapped in the dark . Entering the light is no vague , random occurrence but a conscious choice we darkness dwellers must reaffirm every day . DESPITE ALL THE WONDERFUL TRUE STORIES ABOUT FOLKS who choose victory over darkness through the way of illumination , we mostly live as if we 're convinced the apple ca n't possibly fall farther than the outermost branch of the tree . We all start out stuck to some aspects of our history , and surprisingly few of us proceed to get unstuck . If we remain as we are , the shadows gradually creep over us and we find ourselves in utter darkness sooner or later . I think of Emma , a smart , funny , and vivacious woman who once had the world by the tail . Her family history was a bit of a horror show , but she preferred to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy childhood . It seemed for a while like she had stepped into the light , but that long patch of darkness behind her was just dormant . Concentrating on her career and remaining single until the biological clock started sounding its chimes , she decided to marry an agreeable man she was mildly fond of . He , for his part , earnestly desired to possess her but seemed patently incapable of appreciating or even understanding her . Emma 's friends bravely stepped forward months before the marriage and counseled against the union . Yet Emma , never one to trust her heart , insisted that there was nothing wrong with choosing a spouse based on practical concerns . The marriage took place on schedule . Within two years Emma 's life came apart . She fell into depression , could n't hold a job , and became increasingly unsure of herself . Her husband closed a protective net around her and offered her a distant and controlling sort of security . Meanwhile he reinforced the idea that she was incapable of surviving " in her condition " without him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her and struggled to become a model homemaker . The former glow of her personality was extinguished , and a once confident and exuberant professional was reduced to a fragile , emotionally crippled woman hardly able to meet the eyes of her friends . DARKNESS IS IN THE WORLD , THERE 'S NO MISTAKING IT . It inhabits a cell in each one of us according to the doctrine of original sin . It casts the shadow of imperfection and brokenness across our personal histories , and , try as we might to pretend it away , it remains the undertow of human existence . And it will creep forward and overwhelm us unless we acknowledge it , name it , and deliberately choose to turn our faces toward the light . I know so many gifted writers who do n't publish a word ; singers who do n't sing ; born preachers who never claim their vocation ; couples with a genius for children who do n't dare to have them . I know folks bursting with love who do not express it in acts of self-giving and remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public eye . All of these gifts are lost to the community because of the long shadow that sin casts . Some of us do n't believe in who we are , and others are afraid of shouldering the responsibility of our true identity . Ignorance , fear , denial , and low self-esteem create a web of deceit that masks who we 're called to be . For the Prince of Lies , falsehood is the passport into darkness that claims us until we make clear and conscious choices against it . Is there hope that Emma might have her victory over the dark ? The steps that must be taken are hers alone , but her friends are also crucial to her success . When they meet with her , she asks each time , " Do you remember how I was before ? " What she is really saying is : Do you still see me ? It may be difficult for Emma to find her true reflection in the mirror these days , but in the memory that her friends hold alive for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drawn forth like Lazarus from the tomb . The light they hold in their hearts for Emma is like a vigil candle burning in intercession on her behalf . ACCORDING TO JOHN 'S GOSPEL , THE MOST IMPORTANT battles we ever face are supernatural ones . Unlike the other three gospels that view opposition to Jesus ' ministry in terms of worldly power and politics , the perspective in John is steadfastly cosmic . Jesus is not having a squabble with a few irate mortal institutions-Pharisees and Saduccees-or even the great Roman Empire . In John 's view Jesus , the eternal Word of God , is pitted against the primordial spirit of darkness that seeks to overrun creation with its chaos and lifeless void . This is an ultimate contest that will be fought , soul by soul , until the end of time and the arrival of the great city whose light is the Lamb . In these terms , each of us stands on the edge of a perilous firmament , balancing between those opposite forces from which creation was made . Light and darkness , day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our moral decision-making . One way offers clarity and sure-footedness , the other , chaos and inertia . Thanks to John 's cosmic expansiveness , we can believe that life is more than what meets the eye . The resources of grace available to us are as vast as the destructive darkness that can lead to our disintegration . John 's perspective gives us reason to hope in the power of prayer that marshals angels to the side of goodness . Through John 's magnificent vision , we begin to understand why all those vigil candles lit over so many centuries were more than pretty symbols of hope against hope . Each one represents a deliberate choice to believe in the light more than in the seductive dark . A FRIEND OF MINE , GROWING UP IN A NON-CHRISTIAN HOME , often tells the story of watching her estranged Irish father light candles in Catholic churches . It was an inscrutable yet compelling gesture and left a deep impression on her . Without an hour of sacramental catechesis behind her , she knew this sign held value . Forty years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city church and felt moved to light one of those candles . This simple act-choosing the light-put her on a long road of conversion that led to the clasping of quite another light , the paschal candle at the Easter Vigil . When the world is so full of light , why curse the darkness ?
