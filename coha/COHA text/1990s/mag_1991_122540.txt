In O'Fallon , Ill. , a suburb of St. Louis , it 's a perfect night for soft-ball . Dark clouds sag with their weight of moisture , and gusts of wind buffet the low buildings like waves of surf . A cold drizzle falls in the gloom of an early February evening . The mercury hovers around 30 ? . Softball weather . // Oh , did we mention that we 're talking about indoor softball ? // The weather outside may be frightful , but inside the 42,000-square-foot Ball Park Sports Center , the Boys of Summer and Winter are gleefully at play . Tonight , Investors Life , which sponsors a team made up primarily of guys from the Granite City Steel mill , is taking on players representing Show Me 's , a restaurant in the nearby town of Fairview Heights . // A stocky guy from the Show Me 's team steps to the plate , and he zings a line drive to centerfield . The fluorescent orange ball jumps off the AstroTurf , rebounds off the wall and rolls back toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunched over like a crab , snatching at the ball while two runs score . After five innings , the leftfield scoreboard reads 7-3 in favor of Show Me 's . " This is a great game , " says Investors catcher Arnold Meyer , unfazed by being behind . " I 've been a softball player for 10 years , and I can keep my arm and legs in shape throughout the winter and be ready for spring . The one thing I 'm not crazy about with the indoor game is , it 's deadly quick . I 'm getting up in years , you know . " // Indeed he is . Meyer is a wizened 34 . But that 's not quitting time yet , so he remains part of the small but growing band of softball junkies in the snow belt who ca n't face six months away from their sport . Twenty-six teams from six states participated in last year 's Indoor World Series , which was held at the Ball Park . An estimated 2,000 teams nationwide currently play indoors . They compete at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted tennis clubs and the like . In Cincinnati , enterprising sluggers took over a defunct Ford plant . // Fifty-four teams , both men 's and mixed , compete at the Ball Park , believed to be the only facility in the country built for indoor softball . The park 's magnetism is far-reaching : One team drives 140 miles to play each Thursday . // During the game between Investors and Show Me 's , Ed True , principal owner of the Ball Park facility , sits in the Stadium Club lounge , two stories above ground level . He munches popcorn and watches the game through a huge plate-glass window . Behind him , John the bartender serves drinks at an oak bar . Top 40 music plays in the background , and a handful of patrons watch basketball on two big-screen TVs . The joint seems decidedly upscale for a softball crowd . " We 've even held a wedding reception here , " says True . // True , 59 , was a St. Louis businessman six years ago when he bought the 10-acre plot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sons had played soccer as boys , and True intended to open an indoor soccer facility . Then he heard about a friend who had converted a four-court indoor tennis center into a softball field . " Ed played there and came up with the idea of putting soccer and softball under one roof , " says his wife , Myrna , who now works full time at the BPSC . " That idea has been our savior. " // For three days each week , soccer is played on the turf . The other four days , softball reigns , and the Ball Park truly feels like a ballpark . On this night , the bleachers hold girlfriends , wives and exuberant offspring of the players . " C'm on , Dad ! " a Dennis the Menace look-alike screams to his father at the plate . // From the mound , Show Me 's Stuart Yoza , a sergeant stationed at nearby Scott Air Force Base , lobs a perfect strike . " I 'm from Hawaii , and I had never heard of the indoor game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me about it . It 's a different game  --  fast and fun . I love it . " // The biggest difference between the indoor and outdoor games involves batting . The best indoor hits arc long and low because of the tight parameters of the building and because it has no fences to clear . This is a crippling blow to those huge sides of beef who excel at the outdoor game , the guys who can crack the ball into the next county . // Other differences between the two games exist , as True says , " because we had to make up some rules to accommodate both the building and our league schedule . " For instance , games at the Ball Park last seven innings or 55 minutes , whichever comes first . " When time 's up , that 's it , " says Investors manager Dave Fraley . " We do n't even break ties . " // As for the logistical rules , they 're comparable to those that make Arena football a far different game from the one Joe Montana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate to the outfield wall , hangs just below the Ball Park 's ceiling to prevent balls from getting trapped in the rafter beams . If a batter hits the net with an infield pop-up , it 's a foul ball . A ball glancing off the net above the outfield is in play . So is anything hit off the 18-foot-high wall that rings the outfield . So is anything that reaches the blue tarp that 's suspended from the 44-foot-high roof and drapes behind the entire outfield wall . " In the outdoor game , you step back when a hit is over your head , " says Show Me 's manager and outfielder , Tim Garcia . " But in here , you wait for the carom. " // In centerfield a red-tarp target hangs in front of the blue tarp . To the hitter , 220 feet away , it looks like an oversized matador 's cape . " Hit it and you get a double , " says True . " It 's the longest shot in the building , and the batter has to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarp , this one green , is above the scoreboard in left . This target is 190 feet from the plate , and batters who hit it are rewarded with a home run . " Only 12 since September , " says True . ( Rightfield has no such target , so lefty pull hitters are out of luck. ) // The orange ball has a cork core , as opposed to a traditional Softball 's much harder center . As a result , the ball does n't carry as far . However , it still skids off the hard AstroTurf surface , giving an advantage to wiry outfielders with sure hands . " That ball hits your glove and just wants to jump back out , " says Garcia . // " I love the indoor game , " says Joe Kicielinski , who plays first base indoors for the St. Clair A team , and whose summer-league team reached last year 's National Softball Association World Series . " It puts finesse back in the sport . There 's a premium on quick guys who can do it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our summer team has done well recently because we took the indoor game and started playing it outdoors . " // Not everyone plays as well as Kicielinski &amp; Co . As Investors and Show Me 's prove , some real Keystone Kops routines can take place in the indoor outfield , with players falling over one another in their struggle to control the elusive ball . After 55 minutes , all antics and heroics come to an end ; the Show Me 's prevail 8-4 to remain undefeated for the season . " We escaped with our lives , " says Garcia . " Usually we win by 10 runs or more . " // " The speed of the game is what I find frustrating , " says Meyer , the aging Investors catcher . " Guys get thrown out at first by outfielders  --  I 've seen it happen to rabbits . " He pauses , and his dismay fades . " Oh well , no matter . Win or lose , post-game is beer time on our team . We 're either toasting with it , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investors and toasting Show Me 's alike  --  repair to the Stadium Club lounge , where , on this night , the proceedings remain sedate . Such is not always the case , according to a few of the players . One night , they say , bar patrons signaled last call to players on the field by mooning them through the plate glass . True doubts the truth of that particular bit of Ball Park lore . // In any event , there are no moons out tonight , and as the witching hour passes , the park and its lounge empty out . John Phillips , a Ball Park regular , lingers . He looks at the darkened infield and muses on how the facility has changed things for him and for others . // " I used to spend the winter catching up on my reading , " he says . " Others joined bowling leagues , or they simply hibernated . The Ball Park brought a lot of the summer guys back together in the off-season . I guess that 's what 's really fun , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right about this time each year I ca n't wait to smell the grass , see the sun and feel the wind again .
