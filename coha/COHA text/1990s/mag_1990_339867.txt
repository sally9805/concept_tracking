When the University of Pennsylvania denied tenure to Rosalie Tung in 1985 , the Chinese-American business professor decided to put up a fight . Charging discrimination on the basis of sex and race , Tung asked the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to investigate . But the university turned down the agency 's request to see the peer-review letters that contained evaluations of Tung 's performance by her colleagues . Last week the U.S. Supreme Court bluntly told the university to hand over the documents . The decision was one of a quartet of major rulings from the high bench , which also touched on pornography , housing discrimination and criminal law . <P> In the Tung case , the university insisted that releasing the materials would encroach on academic freedom and undermine the confidentiality that is the backbone of the tenure system . The court dismissed that argument and gave the EEOC broad power to obtain tenure documents . Wrote Justice Harry Blackmun : " The costs associated with racial and sexual discrimination in institutions of higher learning are very substantial . . . Ferreting out this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governmental interest . " <P> Many college administrators were critical of the ruling . Said David Markowitz of the American Council on Education : " There will be fewer people willing to take part in peer reviews . The court is asking people to submit themselves to possible punishment for being candid . " But Tung , who now teaches at the University of Wisconsin , saw things differently . " If people make an objective evaluation of a candidate 's work , " she said , " they have nothing to fear . " <P> Last week 's other major rulings : <P> Pornography . As in last year 's controversial flag-burning decision , the Justices upheld the First Amendment guarantees for individuals espousing an unpopular cause  --  this time , the right to peddle pornography . Reviewing an appeal from Dallas , the high bench refused to strip sexually oriented businesses of important constitutional protections . By a 6-to-3 vote , the court struck down the licensing portion of a 1986 city ordinance that strictly regulated adult bookstores and movie houses through zoning , licensing and inspection requirements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban blight and crime associated with such enterprises , the court concluded that the licensing scheme amounted to an unconstitutional " prior restraint " on speech because it did not impose a time limit for acting on applications and did not provide for prompt judicial review . However , the court unanimously upheld the Dallas ordinance as it applies to " hot sheet " sex motels . <P> First Amendment experts generally cheered the Dallas ruling . " Over and over , the court has said that licensing standards must be crystal clear , " explained University of Michigan law professor Frederick Schauer . " This is a quite proper application of the court 's long-held distrust of official discretion . " Conservative court commentator Bruce Fein disagreed , charging that " the high court is doing a pirouette around obscenity laws . "
