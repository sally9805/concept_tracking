It is especially hard to solve a mystery if all the people who actually know the truth are either accomplished liars , adamantly mute , or already dead . Such a conundrum is facing investigators who are still trying to unravel the Iran- contra scandal and other baroque plots that American officials may have hatched in the Middle East over the past decade . Last week , as yet more charges came to light , there was no shortage of fingerprints , plot twists or stool pigeons . But there was a desperate shortage of certainty , perhaps because when truth is stranger than fiction , the two are harder to separate . <P> There are a handful of people who could plausibly answer the frightening questions that date back to 1980 . Did Reagan campaign officials conspire with Iran to delay the release of the hostages until after the election ? For how long did U.S. officials secretly help supply weapons to Iran ? Were they also helping the Iraqis to illegally acquire missile parts and chemical weapons ? If they were willing , Ronald Reagan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if they were still alive , former CIA Director William Casey , Israeli counterterrorism expert Amiram Nir and Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini could . <P> And so can I , claims Ari Ben-Menashe , a former Israeli intelligence officer who clings like kudzu to every new conspiracy theory that sprouts in the thicket of conflicting tales . Since the others are n't talking , even his wild charges get a wide audience . He was among the first to leak the details of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran back in 1986 . He is one of the sources behind the stories about a purported " October surprise " hostage deal in the 1980 campaign . And now he has told Senate investigators that between 1986 and 1988 the Reagan Administration was secretly supporting shipments of arms  --  including chemical weapons  --  to Iraq , despite pleas and complaints from Israel about the dangers that Baghdad posed to its neighbors . <P> As charges mount that the Reagan Administration consistently violated both the law and its own stated policies , the Senate Intelligence Committee seems compelled to at least hear out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lawmakers must decide whether to recommend confirmation of White House deputy for national security affairs Robert Gates as the new CIA director . Ben-Menashe 's claims have provided another wrinkle , since he charges that Gates , while serving on Jimmy Carter 's NSC staff and then as Casey 's deputy at the CIA , participated in illegal operations . <P> Over Memorial Day weekend , Ben-Menashe arrived in Washington bearing allegations about Gates that went far beyond his handling of the Iran-contra scandal . Ben-Menashe charges that Gates was present at three 1980 meetings between William Casey , then manager of Reagan 's election campaign , and Iranian officials in Madrid , at which they allegedly discussed delaying the release of the 52 American hostages in Iran in return for shipments of arms through Israel . Ben-Menashe also claims that Gates attended a final meeting in October in Paris , which included not only Casey but the vice-presidential candidate and former CIA chief , George Bush . President Bush has repeatedly denied being present at that meeting , calling the charges " bald-faced lies . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
