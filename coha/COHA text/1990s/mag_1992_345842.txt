Certain expressions can be rendered only in French . Esprit de corps . Joie de vivre . Cherchez la femme . Croissant . They do n't really work in translation . And that is true of fin de siecle . " End of the century " sounds flat and clunky . It does n't carry the suggestion conveyed by the original of hectic decay and a sort of perfumed dying fall . <P> When the expression fin de siecle first appeared in France roughly 100 years ago , it meant modern and up-to-date , but it quickly acquired a very negative connotation , and people spoke of a sickness  --  la maladie de fin de siecle . The term was applied to anything thought to be corrupt , febrile , degenerate . <P> What some people called decadent , others called modern . The Fauve painter Andre Derain complained that " we are the mushrooms on ancient dunghills . " But the dunghills produced the art and literature of the modern age , with their deliberate and unprecedented break from history and tradition . <P> In the optimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different tone and temper . The new century seemed to be the new frontier , and predictions about what it would bring were rampant . Many were accurate , from airplanes to television to freeways to disposable bottles . There were some howlers as well , including the forecast that autos would make streets as quiet as country lanes , that there would be no trees left in America by 1920 , and that by the end of the 20th century , blacks would constitute about two-thirds of the U.S. population . <P> No prophet could anticipate what actually did happen . So here we are , an incredible , terrible , marvelous century later , nearing our own fin de siecle  --  and fin de millennium . <P> How do we measure up in comparison ? We are beset by a whole range of discontents and confusions . For a great many , the dunghill has become a natural habitat . Derain and other observers of depravity would , in fact , be stunned by the chaos of manners and speech , by the hellish ubiquity of crime and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drugs ; by the new varieties of decadence  --  rock songs about rape and suicide , pornography at the corner newsstand , commercials for S &M; clubs on your friendly cable channel , not to mention telephone sex . <P> The prophets of doom from the previous fin de siecle would also find much to welcome . Murky but menacing predictions by Nostradamus are widely quoted . Survivalists are digging caves . Evangelical sects are getting ready for famine , flood , comets and war to accompany the End of the Days , as outlined in the books of Daniel and Revelation . <P> Nevertheless , some of the most persistent forecasts of doom have so far not come true , and others keep being recalled , like defective cars . So our Cassandras have to try harder . The prospect of AIDS unchecked gets more attention than the ever growing life expectancy , and gene technology suggests nefarious experiments with life itself as much as dramatic new ways of preventing disease . We have come to distrust science . The public even seems bored with space travel , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the computer , the most important achievement of our century .
