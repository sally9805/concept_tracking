<p> Kevin P. Green answered the door at his North Side town house one night to find policemen waiting outside . The officers held four basketballs and asked Green to get his famous next-door neighbor to autograph them . <p> He said , " I would n't ask Michael Jordan for myself . Why would I ask for you ? " <p> On another night across the city , the doorbell rang at a Kenwood house for students at the Catholic Theological Union . The callers had chased down some would-be thieves and were returning stolen hubcaps , said the Rev. Stephen Huffstetter a priest who lives at the house . <p> They were guards of Louis Farrakhan , the head of the Nation of Islam , stationed across the street at Farrakhan 's mansion . <p> Such is life when you live in the same neighborhood as a celebrity . <p> What 's it like ? Do n't expect an invitation to Mr. Big 's next party  --  most celebrities stick to their own kind , and you 're not going to make the cut no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And forget about an increase in your home 's value . Stars add glamor to a neighborhood but they do n't add bucks . <p> But you can count on bragging rights at the office , and if you 're lucky an extra bit of security at home . <p> Neighbors of Mayor Daley in the Central Station development south of the Loop can attest to the latter . An unmarked police car is stationed 24 hours a day in Daley 's complex , dissuading those who would drive up in a U-Haul to empty out a house . <p> People in Farrakhan 's neighborhood " like the fact that the guards are there . They feel they have extra security , " said 21st Police District Cmdr. Wayne Milla . <p> But the impact may be limited .

She has worked with Bears kicker Kevin Butler , and former Bears Maury Buford and P.T. Willis . <p> A celebrity 's presence also creates prestige in the eyes of outsiders , giving a home a competitive edge over other properties when it 's put on the market . This typically translates into more showings and quicker sales . <p> " It 's amazing how people in our society are intrigued ( with celebrities ) . They definitely find it attractive ; they flock to it , " said Greg Viti , an agent with Remax Lincoln Park . <p> Green recalls the time he was holding a garage sale when His Airness strolled by . " All these people at my garage sale were stunned , " he said . " Here they 're bartering away for something for two dollars and he walks by .

" You might get to say good morning or good afternoon and that 's about it , " said someone who lives in the same building as former tennis star Billie Jean King , who lives on the city 's Near North Side . <p> Green mostly sees Jordan 's wife , Juanita .

" <p> Understand that Green is not complaining about living next door to a world-famous athlete . He 's even protective of the Jordans . " Occasionally somebody knocks on my door and asks , ' Where does Michael Jordan live ? ' I say I do n't know either . We all try to keep it very low-key and not bother them . " <p> The celebrities return the favor . <p> " She does not comport herself as a celebrity ; she comports herself as a private person living in a private residence , " said Philip Corboy , describing Oprah Winfrey , a fellow resident at Water Tower Place on North Michigan Avenue . <p> The famous talk-show host is " an unassuming person , unobtrusive in private , " said Corboy , who has accumulated no small amount of fame for himself as a personal injury attorney . <p> In fact , some people in their building may not even know Oprah lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room where people can meet , he said .

When the DePaul area address of former White Sox pitching star Jack McDowell was printed , so many people knocked at the door that McDowell had to put up a fence , said Ronda Fish , an agent with Remax Exclusive Properties . <p> " It 's an invasion of the neighborhood when that happens . I think it 's unfair , " she said . <p> That 's why many highly recognizable people choose to live in high-rises ( like Oprah ) or compounds where their homes do n't face the street ( like Jordan and the mayor ) . <p> " One of the problems with compounds is that they 're not part of the community , " said Lorraine Hoffmann , treasurer of the Lake View Citizens Council . <p> To further avoid public exposure , a celebrity often will use a different name when shopping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Habitat Co .

None of the agents interviewed for this story would divulge a celebrity address . <p> In looking for a home , stars look for the same things everybody else looks for : a good value , good location , good schools and a chance for appreciation . <p> Are there any negatives in living near a big name ? <p> Residents of one Lake View neighborhood asked that question in 1993 when they learned that Billy Corgan , lead singer of the Chicago rock group Smashing Pumpkins , was moving in . <p> Ogden Sandborg , two houses down from Corgan , worried about loud rock music and wild parties .

She 's been involved in community affairs for 25 years , but until contacted for this story , she did not know that Jordan or Corgan lived in her area . @x HAVANA -- There is a place tantalizingly close to American shores that -- but for reasons of politics and foreign policy -- could emerge as a welcome new source of oil for U.S. consumers . That surprising potential entrant onto the world energy stage is Cuba . The island nation , says Jorge Pion , a leading expert on Cuba 's energy at the University of Miami , " can certainly become a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest wild cards in the Western Hemisphere 's energy outlook . It is also the most politically sensitive . The nearly half-century-old U.S. embargo against the Communist country means that American energy companies and consumers can not partake in Cuba 's oil business . Even foreign firms using drilling technology of U.S. origin could face legal action . The Bush administration went so far as to disrupt a conference of Cuban and U.S. oil executives underway at a Mexico City hotel because the hotel was part of the U.S.-based Starwood chain . But given Cuba 's proximity -- and the relatively low cost of transporting its oil were the embargo removed -- U.S. oil executives still pay attention . A major oil find in Cuban waters could subvert the old logic behind the U.S. embargo of Cuba , a policy that endures in part because it imposes only minor economic costs while meeting the political demands of hard-line Cuban-Americans . " It would obliterate the domestic political excuse , " says Julia Sweig , a Cuba expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington . Adds Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado , a Cuba energy watcher at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game changer . " In the Obama administration , Cuba 's oil development is likely to be seen as an issue for the future . Says a senior State Department official , " If it 's a game changer , it 's not going to be a game changer for a while . " Other players . Other countries are not barred from investigating Cuban-controlled portions of the Gulf of Mexico , and they are doing just that . The future drilling byforeign oil companies as close as 45 miles from the shores of Florida injects new dimensions into the debate in the United States over the embargo . Some decry the lost opportunities of a policy that still aims to isolate Cuba while other countries do the opposite . Others worry about ecological risks of any oil spills , which ocean currents would tend to carry toward the Florida Keys and the state 's east coast beaches . Cuba now supplies about half of its own energy needs , say its officials , principally from an oil belt running along its northern coast . Operations include both traditional onshore wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap oil under the shallow , coastal waters nearby . The oil is what specialists call heavy and sour , less suitable and more expensive to refine into gasoline because of its thickness and high sulfur content . All of Cuba 's heavy crude goes into its oil-burning electricity plants . The oil action that pulls in global interest lies farther off the coast , beneath the deep waters of the Gulf . How much lighter , lower-sulfur crude is out there remains unclear . The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that Cuba 's offshore fields contain about 5 billion barrels of oil -- comparable to Colombia or Ecuador -- as well as 10 trillion cubic feet of natural gas . Last October , however , Cuba 's state oil company unveiled a dramatically higher estimate : more than 20 billion barrels of recoverable crude -- a level that , if proved correct , compares to that of the United States . Cuba , with just 11.2 million people , would enter the top 15 oil-reserve nations -- courtesy of subsea oil geology like that off the Mexican and U.S. Gulf coasts . " Cuba has high potential from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exploration manager for the state oil company Cubapetroleo , or Cupet . Experts say it would take three to five years to launch commercial oil extraction following a large discovery . Exploratory drilling is due to resume in the second quarter of this year 20 miles north of Havana by a consortium led by Spain 's Repsol , along with India 's Oil &; Natural Gas Co. and Norway 's StatoilHydro . Repsol struck oil in 2004 , though not in commercial quantities . Other foreign firms will very likely do exploratory drilling in Cuban waters in 2010 and 2011 , following on their seismic tests in recent years . Tenreyro calls the seismic testing " very encouraging . " The lure of offshore oil has drawn not only the Spanish , Indians , and Norwegians but also firms from Malaysia , Vietnam , Venezuela , and Brazil . Says a senior diplomat from one country partnered with Havana , " The Cubans are very hopeful , and so are we . " Venezuela 's state oil company has guided the renovation of one of Cuba 's aging refineries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more , as well as build a new refinery at the port of Mantanzas . As Cuba 's key ally , Venezuela has also thrown it an energy lifeline , shipping about 90,000 barrels per day under easy terms that amounted to a roughly $3 billion subsidy last year . Russian firms have pledged to help Cupet find , extract , and refine oil . And Petrobras , the Brazilian state oil giant known for skillful deep-water drilling , also is investing in Cuba . At an oil deal signing ceremony here last year , Cuban President Ral Castro wondered aloud whether Petrobras would hit oil . " Do n't worry , Ral , " replied Brazil 's President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva . " We 're going to find it here , and we 're going to transform it into energy . " Cuba 's dealings with outside oil firms have not been all rosy , though . Canada 's Sherritt International last year relinquished its offshore oil blocks to the Cuban government before it started drilling . A cash-strapped Cuba fell behind on payments to both Sherritt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than $500 million . In January , Cuba told Pebercan it was terminating their agreement prematurely . And observers are waiting to see how much the global oil price drop hinders plans for expensive , deep-water drilling in Cuban waters . Though Americans may not join in , the prospecting on the Cuban side of the Gulf of Mexico has already become controversial . Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson seized on the issue last year , urging that a 32-year-old boundary accord evenly dividing the sea between the Florida Keys and Cuba be scrapped . Nelson charged that a Cuban oil spill could " desecrate part of Florida 's unique environment and devastate its $50 billion tourism-driven economy . " Cuban officials vow that offshore drilling will meet " the highest standards available " for environmental protection . In Cuba , meanwhile , expectations run high that oil finds will help lift the struggling state-run economy . " It will give Cuba the capabilities of developing its economy very quickly , " predicts Josefina Vidal Ferreiro , a senior Foreign Ministry official . " It will give us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-currency flows from oil exports will strengthen the ruling Communist Party to withstand whatever pressures remain from Washington . Cuba 's needs . Cuba 's leaders have been acutely concerned about energy dependence on others . The collapse of the Soviet Union , once the island 's patron and energy donor , crippled Cuba 's economy and spawned an energy crisis in the early 1990s . Daniel Erikson , an analyst at the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington and author of The Cuba Wars , says Cuba 's pursuit of offshore oil reflects wariness about its past energy dependence on the Soviets and today 's on Hugo Chvez 's Venezuela . " They realize that nothing lasts forever , " he says . It remains unclear , though , whether future oil wealth will hasten -- or retard -- the cautious moves toward economic reform under Ral Castro . Oil revenues could cushion a broader but painful shift away from state direction of all major economic activity . By easing the hardships of life in Cuba , oil wealth could reduce pressures for political change . It could even reinforce the status quo . " Resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archibald Ritter , a Cuba expert at Carleton University in Ottawa . Oil development " will change the position of Cuba with respect to the United States and the whole world , " says Lus Ren Fernndez , a University of Havana foreign policy specialist . But , he cautions , " it can be a complex problem to have easy money at the same time you 're rebuilding the society . " Long accustomed to privation , that is a problem most Cubans would like to have . Cuban Oil Exploratory drilling in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to resume later this year .
