<p> Any map can show you that it 's about 100 miles down I-10 from Tempe , Ariz. , to Tucson . <p> Except a college basketball map . In hoop terms , the distance between Tempe , home of Arizona State , and Tucson , home of Arizona , is best measured not in miles but in light years . <p> Among college teams in major conferences , there might not be a more drastic difference between two programs so close together as this one . The Arizona Wildcats are the defending national champions and No. 1 team . The Arizona State Sun Devils lost 20 games last season , lost their coach in September and await possible federal indictments concerning alleged point-shaving in 1994 . <p> As another season of highs and lows in college basketball begins , it is in Tucson and Tempe where you will find some of the highest highs and lowest lows . <p> In Tucson , supremely confident Arizona coach Lute Olson has his eight top players back from the team that beat Kentucky for the national title last spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team will be better . <p> " For some years now , we 've had the kind of program that every time you come to play us , you know it 's going to be a tough game , " he says . " That should be the case again this year . " <p> In Tempe , an anonymous interim coach named Don Newman , whose previous head coaching experience was five years and a 20-114 record at Sacramento State , does n't really know what to expect , though there are those who fear the worst . <p> " There 's not a team in the Pac-10 that I would blame for expecting to come in and wipe the floor with us , " Newman says . <p> This is the story of two teams in the same state , in the same league , worlds apart . <p> Cohesion vs. mayhem <p> In Tucson . . . the mood is loose . <p> The Wildcats are in a lively scrimmage , and super sophomore point guard Mike Bibby lofts a perfectly thrown lob that center A.J. Bramlett vigorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stands , where the student managers are keeping practice stats . <p> " Assist ! " he shouts with glee , and one of the managers dutifully makes a mark with his pencil . <p> Olson occasionally stops play and makes his points calmly , softly , and his players then execute his advice with precision . <p> They are national champions , and they act like it . <p> They talk about winning another championship this season as if they were ordering a refill of soda . <p> " Anything less , and our season wo n't be complete , " Bibby says . " This is the last year that this group of players will be together . Everybody feels like we have to win another championship to go down in history . " <p> In Tempe . . . practice is spotty , and emotions are raw.Suddenly , Newman , upset at a nonchalant move by forward Bobby Lazor , explodes . <p> He puts two hands on Lazor 's chest and sends him flying . <p> " You want to see some attitude ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You act like we 're good or something . Well , we ai n't that ( bleeping ) good ! " <p> The ASU players still are adjusting to the intensity level of Newman compared to the relaxed style of Bill Frieder , who recruited them to Tempe . <p> Frieder resigned under fire Sept. 10 , shortly after two of his players , Reggie Hester and Eddie House , were arrested in connection with a dorm theft of a compact disc player . <p> That , following other player misdeeds , recruiting setbacks and back-to-back 13-15 and 10-20 seasons got athletic director Kevin White wondering whether Frieder was up to turning things around . Frieder , whose program had slipped badly since reaching the Sweet 16 in 1995 , was n't sure he could , or whether he even wanted to try . And so it was agreed he would step down . <p> After a failed attempt to hire Utah 's Rick Majerus , Newman , hired in May to help recruit , was given the job for one year . <p> He will coach a team that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of players who are all in either their first or second years in the program . <p> Of course , none of the current ASU coaches or players were around in 1994 . That is the year focused on by an FBI investigation into point-shaving that could turn out to do more damage to ASU 's image than anything the Sun Devils do on the court this season . <p> Indictments , possibly involving one or more former Sun Devils , could come as early as next month . <p> " That does n't affect me , " Veal says . " Sure , I 'm curious about it . But I 'm leaving it up to the FBI . It 's kind of sad . If players were involved , I feel sorry for them . I hope they were n't involved . But people make decisions , and I ca n't say why . " <p> In 1994 , Veal made the decision to come to Arizona State . <p> Regrets ? <p> " No , I do n't regret it , " he says . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough . " <p> Reaping rewards vs. paying dues <p> In Tucson . . . Olson , 63 , recently signed a five-year contract , so he plans to be around to try to add to his 18 trips to the NCAA tournament ( 28-18 record ) , four Final Four berths and a 535-200 overall record . <p> He will if he continues to land recruits like Bibby . <p> " I always wanted to come to Arizona , " Bibby says . " Coach Olson , he lets us run , he lets us do what 's comfortable for us . " <p> In Tempe . . . Newman , who will turn 40 next week , is only 515 Division I victories behind Olson . He might be lucky to get 10 this season , but he 's been in this position before , most notably at Sacramento State . <p> Newman took over at Sacramento State in 1992 , the year the school moved from Division II to Division I. <p> Division I coaches know fresh meat when they see it , and they all wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the phone rang all day every day , " he says . " UCLA . Georgia Tech . Georgetown . Tulane . I was the most popular coach on the scheduling circuit . The piranhas were on me , man , and it was n't to invite me to lunch . " <p> After five losing seasons , a newly hired athletic director decided on a fresh start . So Newman went job hunting and landed on Frieder 's staff . <p> No one knows what Newman can do with the cast he has been given . But , as an athlete , Newman did some remarkable things . <p> After playing basketball and baseball at LSU and Idaho , he played point guard in the Continental Basketball Association and defensive back in the Canadian Football League , despite never having played a down of football in high school or college . Newman briefly was a teammate of quarterback Warren Moon with the Edmonton Eskimos . <p> For several years , Newman played basketball and football year-round , sort of a minor-league Deion Sanders . <p> " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> Talent-laden vs. depth-depleted <p> In Tucson . . . there is an embarrassment of riches that finds not one but two Player of the Year candidates in Bibby and senior guard Miles Simon , the Final Four MVP after dropping 30 points on Kentucky in the title game . <p> Also back : swingman Michael Dickerson , guard Jason Terry and postmen Bramlett , Bennett Davison , Donnell Harris and Eugene Edgerson . <p> Olson helps keep intensity up by pitting his best players against each other in practice , which is why you 'll see Simon vs . Dickerson or Bibby vs . Terry , who would be a star for many other Division I teams . <p> " If there 's any complacency , " Olson says , " they get their tails kicked pretty good . " <p> In Tempe . . . a heavy load will be placed on Veal , an all-Pac-10 guard . He should get help from guards House , Hester and Jason Patton and forwards Mike Batiste and Lazor . <p> But he wo n't get help from forward Okeme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major injuries in a car accident in August , or Maurice McCree , a promising junior college transfer who left school for personal reasons . <p> Brad Stricker , a 6-11 center who transferred from Texas A &M; and was going to sit out the season , also left school , storming out after Frieder 's resignation . <p> " I know people do n't expect much from us , " Lazor says . " But I kind of look at that as a good thing . We can do something nobody expects us to do . I really think we can . I do n't think we 're as bad as people think we are . " <p> Hailed vs. heckled <p> In Tucson . . . more than 50,000 Wildcats fans filled the football stadium for a rally when the basketball team returned from its Final Four triumph in Indianapolis . Another 10,000 lined the streets for the victory parade from the airport . <p> " It was ridiculous , " Bibby says . " For several weeks , everywhere we went , we were surrounded . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sold out for Arizona basketball for 10 years . <p> Before the team 's intrasquad scrimmage two weeks ago , the school hung up a banner with the numeral 1 and " Year of the Fan " on it , retiring the number 1 in honor of Wildcats fans . <p> Arizona basketball is practically the only game in town . <p> " In a place as basketball-crazy as this , the players are constantly reminded how great they are , " Olson says , chuckling . <p> In Tempe . . . the Sun Devils are all but disappearing from the sports landscape , obscured by the NBA 's Suns , the NHL 's Coyotes , the NFL 's Cardinals , major league baseball 's Diamondbacks and the resurgent ASU football team . <p> Even two years ago , when ASU was on its way to the Sweet 16 , attendance in the 14,198-seat University Activity Center averaged only 9,333 . Last year , it plummeted to 4,822 . <p> When local people do recognize ASU basketball , it is not always favorably . <p> " You say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause , like , ' Oh , he <p> might be a crook , ' " Veal says . <p> The apathy and the basketball in Tempe have been bad enough the past couple of years that Arizona players hardly even consider the Sun Devils a rival these days . <p> " I do n't even see that as a rivalry game , " Simon says . " I mean , we 've been so dominant . I look at UCLA as a rival , or Stanford or Cal . <p> " But you go over to ASU and the games are n't sold out . It makes you think the game 's just not that important . " <p> At the top vs. starting from scratch <p> In Tucson . . . Olson feels a little sorry for ASU , especially for Frieder , with whom he had forged a close friendship in recent years . <p> " If Bill had n't had bad luck , he would n't have had any luck at all , from injuries to kids signing and then going into <p> baseball , to players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's just not going to be the same without Bill around . " <p> In Tempe . . . Newman , who will be hard-pressed to accomplish his goal of winning the job permanently , is n't accepting sympathy . <p> " Look , you can just fold your tent , or you can dig down and fight back , " he says . " I 'm not going to be down one day of my life . I just do n't live like that . I think you have an opportunity every day to take a step forward . "
