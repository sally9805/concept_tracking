HELLO , MY NAME IS KAREN , and I 'm a paper addict . ( Hi , Karen . ) In the wired world , that admission is tantamount to saying I listen to eight-tracks and drink diet Tab . At home , I get eight magazines , seven mail-order catalogs , and one newspaper . I buy books by the half-dozen . When I surf the Web , I print out pages to read on the train . In an age when you can get directions on the Net , an encyclopedia on CD-ROM , and news via e-mail , what 's a paper junkie to do ? Buy a new printer . Tragically , with all these subscriptions and book-buying binges , I do n't have much leftover money-or room . In search of the perfect fix , I checked out five compact color printers selling for less than $150 . ( A new Epson , the $149 Stylus Color 440 , was too late for review ; it should be in stores by the time you read this . ) For that price , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I was surprised to find that a couple of these models turn out good-looking images relatively fast . In my decidedly unscientific tests , nearly all of them printed a page of text in about half a minute-except the NEC SuperScript soC , which took almost a minute and a half An Adobe Photoshop color image printed in around 2 minutes on all but the Canon BJC-250 and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 400L , which took half that long . The five printers share several characteristics . All are single-cartridge ink jets , which means you can only use one cartridge at a timeeither an all-black one or one that prints three colors . If your printer comes with only a color cartridge ( like four of the printers here ) , you 'll spend $30 to $40 for a black cartridge-a necessity to print true black . ( Three-color cartridges produce a greenish composite black . ) The HP , meanwhile , comes with only its black cartridge ; a color cartridge costs an additional $35 . All the printers are the same tiny sizearound 14 by 7 by 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tootsie Roll with two flat sides . Only the Lexmark 10oo Color Jetprinter has a paper output tray ; with the rest , the prints just ooze out onto your desktop . Finally , each printer comes with a one-year warranty . From there on , these printers distinguish themselves in print quality , features , and documentation-in short , the things that make owning a printer worthwhile . CANON FIRE I STARTED MY paper chase with the $129 Canon BJC-250 , which nearly spoiled me for the others . It was simple to set up , thanks especially to its quick-start guide and well-illustrated manual . The sophisticated software covers every type of image from photos to text-and even has an " automatic " setting that lets the software decide everything for you . The bundled software helps you print banners , T-shirt transfers , greeting cards , and even picture frames . I could cover my walls with paper ! ( Insert maniacal laughter here . ) Even without the optional photo ink kit ( $47 list ) , the BJC-250 impressed me with its print quality-the best overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp on plain paper , and very crisp on glossy paper , though the resolution is just 360 by 360 dots per inch . I used the optional $32 black cartridge to print clear text . None of the printers did especially well with my photo in black and white , but the Canon was the best of the bunch . In my informal tests , the BJC-250 was also one of the fastest , but do n't look for lightning speed from any $150 printer . You 'll get better print quality and faster performance from a more expensive dualcartridge printer , but to my mind , the Canon BJC-250 is a terrific value . Cheap , small , simple , and capable-what more could you ask for ? Photograph CLOCKWISE FROM LEFT : NEC SuperScript 150C , HP DeskJet 400L , Canon BJC-250 , Lexmark 1100 Color Jetprinter , Compaq IJ200. // CHEAP CUT FROM COMPAQ WELL , MAYBE You could ask for more , but you would n't get it from the new Compaq IJ200 . It costs as much as the Canon ( $129 ) and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features are n't quite as satisfying . The IJ200 's manual , disappointingly , comes only on CD-ROM . Fortunately , the manual 's helpful quick-start guide got me set up fast . The printer is easy to put together and use , though I was n't happy with its flimsy front cover . Compaq put some high-quality technology ( based on Lexmark 's printers ) into the IJ200 . Just a smidge below the Canon BJC-250 on print quality , the Compaq produces handsome photographs and text , even on plain paper . On glossy paper , a 600-by-600-dpi photo of my brother , my sister , and me at our last family reunion was worthy of sending to my mother . But I still preferred the Canon BJC-250 's lowerresolution photo quality on glossy paper-its color was sharper and more realistic . The IJ200 prints cards , banners , and transparencies , but no fancy stuff , and its speed is about average . I liked the Compaq , but for better print quality and features , I 'd recommend the Canon . HP : HARDLY PERFECT I WANTED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces admirable printers , but it was n't easy . With its weak print quality and completely useless documentation , the DeskJet 4ooL is n't worth the paper it prints on . It lacks a quick-start guide , and the index-free manual is a measly 16 pages long . Like the other four printers , the HP comes with only one cartridge . But unlike the others , it 's the black cartridge . Why ? So HP can sell the printer for just $129 . I paid an extra $35 ( list ) for the ability to print-badly-in color . // Pretty Pictures at a Nice Price // The 400L is fast , but its print quality was the lowest of the bunch in nearly every category . I printed out a color photograph to hang in my cubicle at work , but the 300-by-300-dpi image looked flat and fuzzy , and improved very little with special settings ( of which there are few ) or glossy paper . In black and white , the HP 's photo printing was the worst of the group , though my letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 4ooL prints greeting cards and transparencies , but it wo n't do T-shirt transfers or banners . If my heart belonged to HP , I 'd skip this model and wait for its as-yet-unnamed replacement , which should hit stores around early winter . LEXMARK 'S THE SPOT LEXMARK 'S 1100 Color Jetprinter is the cubic zirconia of printers : a cheap little jewel . The $119 Lexmark is a snap to assemble , literally : All I had to do was pop the paper input guide into the back of the printer , the paper output guide into the front , and the ink cartridge inside . The quick-start guide got me set up painlessly , and the manual was adequate , though it could use a better index . I have just two small beefs : First , I wish the front cover opened a bit wider so I could put the ink cartridge in more easily . Second , I accidentally mistook the slot at the back of the printer for the place to insert the cartridge . Apparently , I 'm not the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Store EXTRA CARTRIDGE here . " I think Lexmark should replace the slot with a separate holder , like the kind most single-cartridge printers have . Though it was the second-slowest printer in my informal tests , the 10oo produced good-looking prints . They looked especially nice at 6oo by 6oo dpi . Its color was attractive , if a little fuzzier than the Canon 's and Compaq 's , while its grays were dark but fairly detailed . Text came out crisp and rich . Like the Canon BJC-25o , the Lexmark prints banners , T-shirt transfers , greeting cards , photos , and even documents with waterproof black ink . // NEC 'S NOT-SO SUPERSCRIPT THE SUBJECT OF my final taste test , the NEC SuperScript 150C , did n't go down easy . It 's dirt cheap-$ug , brought down to an unbeatable $79 with a $40 rebate-but awkward to set up . I had to rely on the sparsely illustrated manual because there was n't a quick-start guide . Then I had trouble inserting the ink cartridge . Finally , even though you 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still had to install it via Add Hardware in my Start menu . Once I got it going , the soC did n't improve much . It was the slowest printer here , and its Goo-by-3oo-dpi print quality did n't thrill me . The NEC printed such a fuzzy photograph-only slightly better than the HP DeskJet 400L's-that I would n't even put it up at work , and that 's saying a lot . On glossy paper , the photo 's color looked garish ; in black and white , the image was ho-hum . If I did n't care about print quality , I could have created all kinds of amusing things like cards and T-shirts on the 150C , since it comes with fun software . But for the same price ( before rebate ) , I could get a lot more value from the Lexmark . PAPER VIEW MUCH AS I 'D like to keep all five models set up and spewing pages , alas , I had to choose . The race was close , but when I spread the printouts across my table ( ahhhh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , with my voracious habit , maybe I should spend another C-note and get the Lexmark 1100 Color Jetprinter , too . My next purchase : a really big filing cabinet . // PRINT QUALITY SAMPLES // <p>
