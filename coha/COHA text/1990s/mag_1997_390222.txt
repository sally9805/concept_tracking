IF WE TAKE Richard Osmer seriously ( " The case for catechism , " April 23-30 ) , we will modify one of our most familiar images of pastoral leadership . We have been overly influenced by a psychological understanding of pastoral responsibility . We need a more rabbinical self-understanding of the ministry and a larger appreciation for the cognitive element in Christian faith . They called Jesus rabbi before they called him Savior and God incarnate . Of course , the two perspectives are related . Acquiring patterned Christian belief in a secularized and befuddling era contributes to mental and spiritual health , while psychological savvy can enhance our pedagogy . There is enormous need for the structure offered by a greater doctrinal emphasis . One need only look at the countercultural tabloid press handed out gratis in the malls and local libraries to appreciate today 's pervasive hunger for healing and widespread search for philosophies to live by . Although these therapies and retreats are soft and experiential , they are not short on cosmic assumptions . These assumptions invite our engaged critique . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take issue with their New Age doctrines . How then shall we catechize ? We will try to avoid two errors : one that identifies faith with a shallow assent to religious assertion , an assent that lacks " heart " ; and the modernist one , which reacts to the first error by shunning the cognitive . There is an abundance of religious content to be mastered by the educated Christian , who ought to function with more than a vague " love-thyneighbor " sentimentality . The Bible needs to be taught , as do the basic history and intellectual traditions of Christian institutions . The liturgy begs for deeper appreciation as expression and shaper of Christian faith . Our consumer culture invites religious critique at every turn . Children and youth can master far more difficult materials than many of our mainline church curricula assume . Consider what our grandchildren ( in my case ) teach us in the way of computer skills . Or the work of Jewish after-school parochial education , with its language and cultural studies . As to indoctrination , a legitimate liberal fear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the values clarification movement , Gilbert Meilaender pointed out that moral education is always indoctrination unless we teach virtually nothing or assume naively that all persons will do the right thing because they mean well from birth . The trick is to do the pedagogically right or moral kind of indoctrination , which avoids coercive or deceitful teaching , lying about controversial questions , and browbeating . Good indoctrination admits the realities of disagreement . It gives age-appropriate reasons for its positions . Meilaender criticizes our popular mind-set of believing that any teaching of right and wrong is indoctrination , and that indoctrination is wrong . Much the same critique could be leveled at our religious instruction . With confirmands , we can still have our group-building camp-outs , service projects , content quizzes , field trips and parental involvement . But we will also rehearse-repeatedly-the core Christian story and the interrelations of the elements in doctrine . We may do it , even in this age , by using memorization or question-and-answer catechisms . A stronger catechesis will build heightened consciousness that the Christian community stands over and against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equip more of the laity for giving account of the faith that is in them . This is not a plea for brittle dogmatism or monolithic church doctrine . It does not assume any correlation between IQ and Christian faith . We do , however , want to offer the best that is in us to God 's praise and the human good , and a vigorous catechesis is part of that offering . Gaylord Noyce Yale Divinity School , New Haven , Conn . Richard R. Osmer 's " A case for catechism " is a strong case indeed , hitting a number of nails squarely on the head . Outside the American South , the ecology of educational ministry has shifted dramatically in the 20th century , gravely weakening those experienced-based " modern " approaches to Christian education that seemed to work so well in mainline churches as recently as 30 years ago . New forms of catechetical instruction may be the kind of change we mainliners desperately need , because laypeople do n't know Christian basics as they used to . I look forward to the conclusions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osmer chairs ) on the subject . On the other hand , it is painful to recognize that we Protestants still find ourselves so separated from our Roman Catholic brothers and sisters that Osmer 's article on retrieving catechetical instruction does not even refer to the new Catechism of the Catholic Church ( 1992 ) . Over 30 years in the making , the Catholic catechism is almost by definition part of a global catechetical renewal in the Christian community . Though huge ( 800 pages ) , it is already becoming something of a classic-and it illustrates many of the points Osmer makes in his article . Wayne G. Boulton President , Presbyterian School of Education , Richmond , Va . Megachurches . . . BELIEVE THE wave of the future belongs to churches that minister to persons who face crises and recognize people at various stages of their lives ( see David S. Luecke 's " Is Willow Creek the way of the future ? , " May 14 ) . I have served small congregations throughout 41 years of ministry . The megachurch has its place , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ministering to people throughout a lifetime . Programs are secondary to the personal needs of the families and persons . Although the two congregations I serve are under 100 in membership , we reach hundreds of people through special worship services for those celebrating birthdays , anniversaries , graduations , new jobs and other events in their lives . We reach out , through cards and dinners following funeral services , to people who have lost loved ones . We call on the sick at home or in the hospital and visit people who might have a need or who have lost touch with the church . It is the personal touch of minister and laypersons that makes the lives of all kinds of people , related or unrelated to the church , meaningful . The small congregation offers qualities of ministry that no megachurch can begin to offer . Delbert Wemple Cincinnatus , N.Y . Thanks to David S. Luecke and James L. Kidd for " Is Willow Creek the way of the future ? " and " Megachurch methods . " I was heartened to see a balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek approach . When I visited Willow Creek last year , I was impressed by the leaders ' passionate commitment to their vision . Even someone who differs greatly from the Willow Creek approach can benefit from their leadership events . A visit to Willow Creek will definitely help one clarify one 's vision . Robert Stutes First United Methodist Church , Silsbee , Tex . I appreciate the articles on Willow Creek Community Church ( May 14 ) . To the question " Is Willow Creek the way of the future ? " I would answer no . These megachurches are typically located in growing suburban communities . Unless all of America plans to move to the nearest suburb , the megachurch model has its limits . There is also a conspicuous silence regarding the scandal of the cross ! The cross is never " marketable . " It shatters all human-made expectations planned by the finest and most well-intentioned minds . It reminds us that God meets us in the failures of our lives . This has never been , and never will be , " marketable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thriving upscale communities , the basic traditions of historical Christianity remain a source of comfort and symbol of discipleship that no form of entertainment can address . David Coffin Trinity Lutheran Church , Malinta , Ohio Pastors and litigation . . LAWTON W. POSEY 'S essay raises interesting and provocative cautions about the tendency of clergy types to be generalists and wander into other people 's areas of expertise ( " Pastoral competence , " May 14 ) . My physician grandfather complained about the preaching in the early ' ' 60s that supported adoption of Medicare . ( " What does the preacher know about medicine ? He ought to stick to spiritual matters . " ) Where does this lead us as clergy ? What will be left to us to say as the range of secular professions increases ? Will those unschooled and unqualified in theology ( physicians , auto mechanics and so on ) be practicing religion without a license if they pray with someone or offer them an opinion on the interpretation of scripture ? What does it mean to practice counseling ? Where is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastoral counseling and discernment be tested , licensed and judged by clinical psychologists and lawyers ? Is the practice of pastoral ministry a kind of anemic version of " real " counseling ? Posey assumes that clergy may step out of their depth , in the judgment of psychologists , judges and physicians . He does not seem to express , nor does anyone else these days , a concern that clinical psychologists , physicians or judges might be guilty of religious malpractice . These assumptions should be examined . Stephan W Ross Burley United Methodist Church , Burley , Idaho Exemplar . . . THANKS FOR the article on Jimmy Carter by Bill J. Leonard ( " The private and public worlds of Jimmy Carter , " March 19-26 ) . I am impressed with Carter 's personal and " former president " roles . Reagan went around to meetings for " big bucks . " Fortune magazine reported Bush is available to do what you want for $80,000 . Carter works in Habitat , mediates world conflicts and teaches Sunday school . He sets a standard for us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I FOUND Stanley S. Harakas 's reference to St. Mary of Egypt curious ( " Repent , then obey , " March 5 ) . " Moved to faith in Christ , she crossed the Jordan into the wilderness and lived 40 years there , in repentance , prayer and obedience . " These qualities are basic to Christian life , but in my view piety leads to the gospel call of bringing forth the " fruits of repentance . " I ca n't fathom this happening in isolation , living in the desert for the rest of one 's life . Maurice Whidden Scarborough , Ontario JAMES WALL 'S commentary on Breaking the Waves ( " Paradoxical goodness , " Feb. 5 ) omitted one crucial perspective . This film says that because of a woman 's sacrifice ( in this instance , her total sexual degradation , even unto death ) , a man is healed and returned to functional life . Does anyone in this brutally sexist civilization really need that story again ? James Conn Santa Monica , Calif . Great books . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adventures among the classics " ( April 9 ) . The classics have formed the core of my reading for ten years , ever since my mother bought me a used set of the Great Books of the Western World . More recently I 've been adding the Library of America volumes to my reading . The great authors take up residence in your mind and slowly transform your thinking . Everything of value that I have learned about God or human life I trace to the great books . Most important , they have helped me better understand the scriptures .
