On a warmish Saturday evening in August the police closed the First Kordon to traffic , and the Turks came out to humanize the long thoroughfare that ran along the shore of the Bay of Izmir like a concrete beach . Restaurant owners moved tables onto the crowded sidewalks , and just enough wind purred across the bay around sundown to roil the surface of the steel gray water , causing the anchored boats to lift and dip in a way that soothed the senses . The Bay of Izmir was the Aegean , whose waters mixed with the Mediterranean , which was itself the single most soothing word in several languages . Waiting for the next spasm of cigarette pain to ambush him , Randolph let himself be soothed . <p> He had plied his trade in every country fortunate enough h to border the Mediterranean , but Turkey had always commanded his particular affection . In Europe the Turks got bad press . That was unfair . No Turk he had known was terrible ; many were generosity 's very soul . He watched a round-shouldered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water pipe and coveted his unturbulent private world . A slender boy in sandals with the translucent green eyes Randolph associated with innocence nonchalantly swung his aluminum tray of tea glasses over the heads of people who did not flinch . The boy called out something to a friend in a voice that matched the green eyes and meant enthusiasm , meant he could sleep nights with his eyes open . Then here came a pain spasm , and Randolph gave himself over to its contemplation . <p> When he noticed things again he saw that the sunset over the bay was splendid : no florid excrescence of color overwhelming the horizon , just a chaste red exit suggesting finity . Randolph offered quiet congratulations to the choreographer . At the same time he became aware that he had been watching a young man working on a middleaged couple who were obviously American . They had a table at a touristy place that catered to their genre . They would have been to Ephesus to rock in civilization 's cradle a bit . Their feet would be hurting . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of history that went further back than the Boston Tea Party . No need for churlishness . Pain made him ungenerous . He watched the wife 's sunburnt hand encircle the husband 's sunburnt wrist , then that stalwart 's hesitation , which little domestic drama ended in a greenback slid self-consciously across the table into the young man 's hand . The grace with which the bill disappeared convinced Randolph that he was in the presence of a natural . Some skills could be neither taught nor learned . Anger flashed in Randolph like heat lightning . <p> Why deny it ? Physical beauty had its necessary part to play . Gray eyes , tawny hair just long enough to call attention to itself . Leaving the exhausted couple , the wonderful boy-man skimmed , showing off a body that owed no apology to any common carping citizen . A Greek friggin ' god , this kid . He breezed slowly past the table at which Randolph nursed a glass of raki . <p> " So how much did you make on that little transaction ? A twenty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Greek god stopped , gripped the back of an empty chair with his perfect hands , and with irritating slowness drew himself out of the deep well of himself into which he had dropped . His vacancy was all the more offensive for being natural . <p> " Fifty dollars , " he reported candidly . The voice was as good as the physique : honey sliding over gravel . Randolph was provoked . <p> " Fifty dollars ? I was tipping waiters fifty dollars in the sixties . Fifty dollars is no better than panhandling . It 's what bums do . " <p> The boy-man took that as his invitation to sit at Randolph 's table . <p> " Tell me your life story , " he urged the older man gently , and Randolph marvelled not to be offended . Behold the gift , he announced to himself , and the way the gift worked on people . Even on aging brothers in arms who ought to know better . <p> " Have a glass of raki with me , " he offered , " and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaron . I do n't drink alcohol . " Of course not . Some wise instinct would be at work to protect that perfection . Randolph , too , had been a perfect specimen of his own rare type . He had never in an adventuresome life seen the inside of a hospital . Doctors and their skullduggery ministered to another , less robust order of human being . Too late he had seen that the cigarettes were a serious mistake , and an addiction was an addiction no matter how divine the temple in which it lit . <p> " I 'm Randolph . " <p> " Is that a first name or a last name ? " <p> " You 're twenty two , is my guess , Aaron . " <p> " Twenty two is what I am . " True professionals tended toward a scrupulous regard for the truth in such matters , husbanding their powers of invention for the occasions when they were needed . <p> " You 're sick , are n't you , Randolph . Do you want to tell me about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aaron . Have you ever been to Michigan ? " <p> " Never got the visa . " <p> " Then use your imagination . Picture a dirt road in autumn . To your left lies a deserted sugar beet field , to your right an equally dreary corn field . As far as your eager eyes see : flatness and desolation . On the road in front of you , sugar beets have fallen randomly from the truck taking them to market . In the corn field the stalks rustle . They 're bleached , they 're dead , they 're the bones of autumn . In the woods on the horizon your compatriots eagerly stalk deer with high calibre firearms . The deer are not to blame . As for you , you are young and intelligent and you have an internal demon whose name is ambition . Your buttocks are frozen , and you have no money in your pocket , and your father sleeps with a Bible under his pillow , and your local sweetie suffers from halitosis and figurative myopia . " <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you <p> wanted to talk to me . " <p> " I was driven by a spiteful impulse . " <p> " I 'm not a panhandler . " <p> " In my book , cadging small change from gullible Midwesterners qualifies as panhandling . " <p> " So what do you do for a living ? " <p> " Do n't spoil the sterling first impression you make by being defensive , boy . I was twenty two once , you remember . And I , like you , had no clue to the nature of my vocation . Just imagine : on Malta , three hours after we made each other 's acquaintance , a woman made me the gift of a Mercedes coupe . " <p> " She insisted you take it . " <p> " Not all wealthy people are vulnerable . Do n't make that mistake , Aaron . In our business we deal with individuals , not with stereotypes . " <p> " I do n't think I need a father figure in my life right now , Randolph . " <p> " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent woman with money and time . A few persons of either sex who can teach you the essentials of life in the Med , starting with civilized conversation . And somebody who can help you give a shape to the ambition thumping away inside that impressionable heart . " <p> " And you tell me all this out of the goodness of your heart . " <p> " I tell you all this because you are here and I have it to say . " <p> An aggressively moustached Turk with a white cap and scuffed white sandals waved a sheaf of national lottery coupons in their faces . The drawing was to be the next morning , and millions of devalued lira were at stake . The waiter shooed the hawker from their table , and a final fingernail of sun glowed scarlet on the watery horizon . It disappeared , and the wind blew a little stiffer . At the same time pain gusted inside Randolph 's body , as if to remind him that one mistake a lifetime was sufficient to inspire tragedy . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cough . Another raki . He loved watching the clear liquid grow milky when the ice was added . This was home , in an expanded sense of the word . <p> " If you wo n't drink with me then be gone , " he snarled at Aaron . <p> " I understand , " the boy nodded his head . " You 're retired . " Something preternatural about the way he glided away , as if he were not quite of the earth , just cruising the lower atmosphere in search of an opportunity for self-realization . Randolph regretted telling him the Michigan story until he realized the telling had been for himself . <p> " Another raki , " he confided to the waiter , whose ready obeisance warmed him where he was cool . <p> His hotel was on the Second Kordon , a block back from the tumult of the waterfront and the sewery stench that occasionally spoiled the summer 's romance . In his room , he dozed like a senile citizen until the telephone woke him . A call from Malta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he mouthed a dramatic No ! into the receiver . He felt his eyebrows lift as his mouth pursed ; simple pleasure . <p> " You 're sicker than you are admitting , " she accused him , " you 're standing on that false pride you love to flaunt . " Two sins of character in a single run-on sentence . " Come here tomorrow . There must be a flight . I 'll wire you the ticket . " <p> " I 'm not a kept man , Adelaide , and I wo n't be one . Stick that one in your hookah and toke on it . " <p> " That 's a thin lie , Randolph . " Non-native speakers of English frequently came up with a telling adjective a native would not find . " Thin or fat it 's mine and I 'm sticking with it . " <p> " Please , no cuteness . You 're too sick , I 'm too tired . I will wire your ticket . You do n't mind being a kept man at all . What you mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " The Turks have a saying , Adelaide . To the truth , tell the truth . To a lie , tell a lie . " <p> " I do n't follow . " <p> " I 'm hanging up now . " <p> " I 'm sending you a ticket . " <p> " I wo n't pick it up . " Before he depressed the button he made a noise like international static with his mouth . It was a decent imitation . <p> He switched off the bedside light and lay with his eyes open listening to the traffic outside . A tourist horse and buggy passed by ; the small jingle of bells and the repetitive clop of the animals ' hooves on the pavement gave him , unaccountably , a momentary fillip of confidence . Which was what it was all about . Real as it was , the cigarette pain was secondary . What he had come to this pleasant bayside city to nurse and nurture was his confidence . Adelaide was right ; he still wanted to work . <p> The difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands to be found in his personal atlas . Ironic that it was on Crete that he had first been bothered by pain , first decided it was cancer . Distracted by a full-frontal shot of death , he made a mistake , a poor calculation . Everything of worth he had done in his life required perfect timing , perfect delicacy and discretion . Musing , he condensed the sum of abilities he had needed to prosper into what could be called a knowledge of the human heart . A schmaltzy characterization , but only the inexperienced would deny the haunting link between truth and cliche . <p> There had been a sister and brother from Poland , quick-study capitalists with money to burn . They were renting a lovely , secluded beach house on the south shore . He had described an investment opportunity in the Cayman Islands . Their interest was sufficiently piqued . Then , wonder of wonders , Randolph overstepped himself . Grossly , in fact . Nothing was said by anyone . His hosts were armored in an unhealthily close alliance . They simply shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed his bag . More than the loss of possible profit he had been stunned by his mistake . <p> Other mistakes followed that first disaster . If Randolph had shown a failing it was a reluctance to put money away . What came easy went even easier . It did not take long for a string of mistakes-failures of judgment , really-to eat the modest egg that had been nesting in Switzerland . At the same time the pain grew into an ugly familiar , an alter ego in whom could be found no redeeming feature . The upshot was a loss of confidence , no small matter in a man for whom that quality was the equivalent of venture capital . A sickbed in Malta , consoled with expensive flowers in a crystal vase , was untenable . Thus Izmir . <p> From the beginning , September in the city ran the risk of disappearing without witness down the great black gullet of whose existence Randolph was uncomfortably aware now . He found himself unreasonably put out with the Izmirlis who bustled around him when he sat at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected to pay respectful attention to the decline of a man of talent . He let his ramble-ridden mind drift too frequently to the American man-boy Aaron , who stopped to chat just enough that Randolph spent the intervals waiting for him , wishing the bastard would move on , calculate the height of his ambition in some other sunny coastal city . He knew he had planted the seed of self-doubt in the boy . But it was also evident that Aaron drew some deep pleasure from watching the older man disintegrate . The boy 's little cruelties were an attention Randolph alternately looked forward to and rebelled against . His captivity shamed him . <p> " You nag at me the way people at home did , " Aaron complained one evening . They sat drinking Turkish tea on the terrace of a tea garden just below the walls of the Velvet Castle at the summit of Mt . Pagus . Below them Izmir lay in its urban haze like exhibit A before the jury . While the sun slunk behind an absorbent bank of clouds across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ships that seemed stuck flat to the variegated gray . <p> " Why should I give a flying fuck that the Goddess of Vengeance told Alexander the Great to build a city up here ? " <p> " In a dream . In 3 34 B. c . Fine . Why , in fact , should I give a levitated love act if you 're content to go on fleecing easy marks for pocket change ? " <p> Bats left evanescent vapor trails on the twilight air . Hard-headed kids with skinny ankles played soccer in the dust below the pines inside the castle walls behind them . Just below the tea garden terrace , on the roof of a poor house a woman in a gray scarf watered her plants with her head down , as though contemplation of the splendid view were the prerogative of socio-economic strata higher than hers . Earlier they had clambered on the castle walls , which weakened Randolph terribly . After twenty minutes at the tea garden he still could not quite catch his breath . He ordered them both a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bats ' fluttering swoop . <p> " All I need is a break , Randolph , " Aaron explained . <p> " A break . " <p> " Do n't tell me you did n't have a break somewhere along the line . " <p> " My break was being who I was . " <p> " You ca n't go from twenty bucks to twenty thousand without a break , Randolph . " <p> " You ca n't get a break if you do n't see one coming . " <p> " What 's that supposed to mean , O Wise One ? Permit me to throw myself at your feet that I might learn from Your Ancientness whatever the fuck it is that has lifted you to the pinnacle of success you currently enjoy . While I 'm at it shall I lick the dust from your toes ? Will that get you off , Randolph ? " <p> " I do n't remember ever being quite as crude as you are , Aaron . Not in my greenest ignorance . That 's not a moral judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be dealing with are anything but crude . Crudity is ignorance , and ignorance is the enemy . You should have read about the castle before you came up . Think how many civilizations have rebuilt these walls : the Greeks , the Romans , the Byzantines , the Ottomans . If that means nothing to you then you have less aptitude than I first thought . " <p> " I do n't need aptitude , Randolph , I need a break . " <p> " Let 's get a taxi and go down , child . Disappointment tires me . " <p> " When I grow up I want to be just like you , Randolph . " <p> " I cringe to ask how that is . " <p> " Superior and shabby and living in a second-string hotel someplace no one can find you . " <p> And so it went . While the month barrelled its way into oblivion each day limped . Pain filled up Randolph 's life , and in weaker moments he rehearsed a phone call to Malta that would save face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea below a white cliff , sometimes wine dark as Homer in a funk , sometimes ablaze with Mediterranean light . It would be a comfortable way to die . But the pain let up after each weak moment just long enough for him to reconsider , and when she called he told the night clerk that he did not want to speak with anyone from Malta . His only essential lack was confidence . With confidence would come an idea , and from the idea would spring a plan , and from the plan would issue profit , which in turn would engender new confidence . He would travel a virtuous circle back to strength . Only after his confidence returned would he be able to consider treatment of the cancer . Without confidence , the cure would kill him . <p> There was a hole in the planet 's precious ozone layer , disturbing him suddenly . He pictured the hole : a jagged gouge in the high velvet air , like the spike-edged hole made by an old-fashioned can opener . It became difficult to breathe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Second Kordon . Ordinarily even cigarette pain would not spoil the pleasure of good bread with cherry jam from the Black Sea , black olives , white cheese and hot tea , along with the International Herald Tribune . An expat 's consolations . In Michigan they could scarcely imagine . But a vision of the hole in the ozone made by noxious chemicals soured him . " You okay , Randolph ? " <p> The Greek friggin ' god addressed him from Mt . Olympus . Randolph opened his mouth , but nothing came out . Up to now the pain had been a thing of the body , his mind left intact in order to register just how much he hurt . But one of the many things the doctors never told you was that the cancer eventually ate into the brain , the mind itself , bored into the very tissue of your thought . Synapses began to short out . The walls separating from one another the trillion things you knew and remembered began to crumble . Next thing you knew there was the Virgin Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ozone . <p> " Randolph , you look like one mighty sick puppy . " The waiter appeared , said something in excited Turkish that probably meant sick puppy . Aaron took the man 's arm and said something that might have been in any language or none at all for all the sense Randolph made of it . Randolph was preoccupied . This was his first-ever vision . <p> " I picked up the check , Randolph . Atta ' boy , stand up . Lean on me if you want to . I 'll walk you back to your hotel . Unless you want to check out a hospital . Check in , I mean . Your Blue Cross good in Turkey ? " <p> " No hospital . " " That 's a judgment call I 'm not qualified to holler , Captain . So we 're off to the races . Can you walk a block ? " <p> Letting himself be led was like surrender . Whatever had overwhelmed him at SiSi 's beat a strategic retreat . Randolph was his normal uninhibited self , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been solidly propped by the young American hustler , he would have fallen onto the pavement . Each step required a major retooling effort on the part of his legs , which had forgotten their early-life training . His heart beat like a lovesick pigeon 's . He thought he might be asleep . If not , he craved sleep more than he had craved any one sensation in his error-fraught life . After a block he was in bed . In his head all the noise was Shakespeare at least . <p> " You might have had the courtesy to roll over every once in a while to let me know you were still alive . Is that too much to ask ? Jesus , Randolph , never in my twenty two years have I seen anybody so dead to the world . " <p> " How long did I sleep ? " <p> " Forty days and forty nights . " <p> " Give me a straight answer , please . I need it . " <p> " Six hours and forty minutes . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is it , our first fight ? Was it something I said ? " The air reeked of something familiar his nose was trying to remember . Animal vegetable or mineral ? What he smelled , he realized , was the dangerous smell of hunting , an odor he himself had given off during his working life . He admired the boy 's steely resolve . He had wondered whether the necessary hardness success demanded was there in that comely flesh . The buttery lassitude he felt made him remember the sense of surrender he experienced hobbling like a derelict on Aaron 's arm along the picturesque Second Kordon . He knew to the penny what he stood to lose . <p> " You really ought to see a doctor . " <p> " I suppose I will . " <p> " Before I go , I 'd like to see if you remember an earlier conversation <p> we had . About the importance of getting a break . " <p> " I remember . " Dread brushed Randolph 's swollen nerve ends . <p> " Randolph , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained how sick you were . " <p> Dread brushed . <p> " I told him you were my father , which is what you wanted to be all along , is n't it ? I told him I was taking you to a hospital in Zurich . He was very sympathetic and obliging . " <p> " And he gave you the envelope . " <p> " I need a break , Randolph . Ten grand is a decent break , where I come from . " <p> " You miserable bastard . " Only a true professional could have convinced the Turk at the desk of the uprightness of his intentions . <p> " What would you have done ? I assume you have another stash somewhere in the room here . Flight insurance . " <p> Twenty five hundred dollars . The dread passed , leaving Randolph paralyzed . He had thoughts , but one did not lead to the next the way it should have . He disciplined himself to hear the boy out . <p> " Another guy would turn this place upside down looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were turned . You 're lucky , I 'm not like that . You keep that stash , Randolph , and buy yourself some first-class medical advice . My main concern right now is getting you to try and see this whole thing from my point of view . Without a break a person ca n't go anywhere but down . " <p> Richer or poorer . In sickness and in health . In his paralysis , which was like a profound lethargy only slower , only more so , Randolph was aware of Aaron stooping to kiss his sweating forehead before he left the room . If this was not surrender it was surrender 's shadow . <p> Because his body was slept out he could not achieve the utter blankness he desired . For a long time , long enough that the pleasant , traffic-punctured Izmir afternoon disappeared and a pleasant , trafficpunctured night appeared , what happened was like dreaming awake . It was more than willed fantasies , less than dreaming 's terrible autonomous rush . The only consistent figure resembled the same Mary Mother of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ozone cap while he breakfasted at SiSi 's . Eventually , after hours , he grew tired enough to sleep a second time . <p> " Jesus , Randolph , you look worse than you did when I left . You 'd be better off dead , if you ask me . " <p> " There 's no more money . All I had was in the envelope . " <p> " I would n't lie to a person that just brought me flowers . " <p> Flowers indeed : an expensive arrangement from a florist with taste . <p> " Do n't you want to read the card ? " <p> " Later . What else do you want from me ? " <p> " It 's a mistake to expect the worst from people . Maybe I do n't want anything at all , maybe I want to give you something . " <p> " Give me back my money , please . " <p> " My mother always told my dad that two can live as cheaply as one . " <p> " Your mother gave birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back up , Randolph . If you do n't trust my good intentions , how can I ? " <p> Randolph was giddy . He sat up in bed , but the effort brought on his cough , and he hacked loudly . His limbs trembled , his chest ached , his eyes watered in the soft light of the overhead . <p> " Let 's get you to a doctor , old man . " <p> He shook his head . His laughter echoed like a shriek in his burning ears . " No doctor . I want to take a bath . " <p> " I 'll run the water . " <p> The old clawfoot tub was a luxury . He lazed in chest-high hot water while Aaron sat on a stool holding an ashtray to catch the ash from Randolph 's cheap Turkish cigarette . <p> " Tomorrow you start reading up on the Virgin Mary , Aaron . " <p> " Come again ? " <p> " Legend has it that St. John brought her to Ephesus to live out her last days . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm listening . " <p> " What you do n't know is that the Virgin herself came down to Ephesus not long ago . " <p> " I really wonder how come I came back , you know that ? " " She appeared to a shepherd girl . We can find a Turkish shepherd girl in an hour . Her father will teach her her lines . " <p> " It 's like part of me respects what I did by coming back , but another part is telling me I do n't have any balls . Does that make any sense ? Your ash is falling , Randolph . " <p> " What no one knows is that the reason Mary came back to Earth was to give us a warning . Pollution is murdering the planet . But we have n't done enough to atone for our sins , so if we make the planet uninhabitable we 'll wind up in Hell , every last mother 's son of us . We need a few more centuries to overcome our original sin ; ergo , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really not like my father at all , you know ? So it 's like clean up the planet and be Catholic ? I know where we can borrow a video camera . We can video the kid , then dub it in English . " " Maybe . It 's not so much the medium as the tone . Whatever we do has to ring true . I picture a Catholic foundation devoted to ecology , conservation , anti-pollution . I 'm genuinely worried about the damage being done to the ozone layer , Aaron . " <p> " I picture myself being converted . " <p> " You have no idea how many devout , gullible Catholic people there are out there with money . " <p> " Forget the Protestants . For now , anyway . Right ? " <p> " Will you give me my money back , Aaron ? " <p> " Two can live as cheaply as one . " <p> " You know something ? I 'm happy right now . I 'm very happy . " He took a deep drag on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he lost his equilibrium and slid under the warm water , which smelled of sulphur . <p> When he came up Aaron was gently hectoring , " Tomorrow you see a doctor , Randolph . No ifs ands or buts . " <p> The giddiness had leveled off . Underneath the contentment , what he felt was something he had forgotten feeling . The idea of it had been there all along , of course , the empty shell . But only after he came back up from the bath water , which had begun to cool , only after he noticed his cigarette floating above his submerged left thigh , did the feeling itself spread through him like a golden cognac glow . <p> " All of a sudden I feel confident , " he told the boy . <p> " I think you should give the video thing some serious thought , Randolph . " <p> He sensed another cough spasm building . In another few moments he would erupt , bark like a gaffed seal and disgust them both . The bath water would grow cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to savor his success . More than anything-more than the ten thousand dollars , even , and more than a gilded deathbed on Malta-it was a question of confidence . The Greek friggin ' god leaned comfortably close proffering the ashtray . " I hate to admit it , Randolph , but I feel fairly happy , too . For the moment , let 's say . " <p> Here came the damn cough . Randolph braced his poor besieged body . Before he barked he laughed . The boy , eventually , would have to learn what he himself had always known : First , last , and foremost , it was a question of confidence . He laughed . <p>
