##@x <p> During these days of anguish and sorrow , the Haitian people find comfort in the generous support of the United States and the world community . The unanimous condemnation of the Sept. 29 military coup has earned our gratitude . <p> But as news of massacres and repression slip off the front pages , there is a danger that active support will wane , and with it the hopes and dreams of the Haitian people for democracy . <p> We have paid a high price for democracy in Haiti , struggling over 200 years against a series of vicious dictatorships . Institutions inherited from the past were rotten . <p> When the people overwhelmingly elected my Government in December 1990 , accountability was unknown : The political system was designed to perpetuate internal colonialism . We inherited a nation with one physician for every 3,000 inhabitants , but a soldier or policeman for every 200 . A nation in which more than 90 percent of the population lived in abject poverty , while the elite enjoyed a lavish standard of living . <p> Perhaps it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our future , erupting into a violent overthrow of the constitutional democracy the Haitian people had fought so bravely to craft . <p> The coup leaders have charged our Government with abuses of human rights and suggested that this justifies their violent actions . But what could be a worse human rights violation than overturning the constitutional democracy that is a guarantor of human rights ? <p> Restoration of democratic rule in Haiti will require a comprehensive social dialogue , including a program to address the army 's role as the key instrument of internal colonialism . Since Haiti has no war to fight , it does not need weapons for its defense . Tanks , cannons and armored vehicles have been used only to control crowds and to seize power , in lieu of allowing political speeches , arguments , polemics and fair elections . <p> The army 's role should be limited to areas in which prompt and disciplined intervention is necessary : prevention of national disasters , search and rescue operations , assistance in the development of deprived areas , building and maintaining highway systems and patrolling our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required by the the Constitution , will also insure order in various communities and will comprise people from the concerned communities . <p> Even as we triumphed in democratic elections , we recognized the danger posed by elements in the military  --  people who had been tied to the previous dictatorship or aligned with the traffickers who turned Haiti into a key transfer point for drug smuggling . When we took the reins of Government , we spoke of a marriage between the army and the people . We spoke of security as the first child this marriage would yield , a security and peace never before known by our people . <p> The marriage was never fully consummated . But the initial effort yielded a remarkable reduction in human rights violations . The record speaks for itself . During the rule of Prosper Avril , from June 1989 to February 1990 , there were 725 violations of human rights , according to the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees . During the 10-month administration of Ertha Pascal-Trouillot , from March 1990 to January 1991 , 590 violations were documented . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were recorded , and none were attributed to our Government . <p> Reports that our Government incited the people to violence or revenge have no basis in reality . Not one political assassination occurred during our Administration . Not one political prisoner was jailed . No boat filled with frightened , political refugees fled Haiti for U.S. shores . <p> Ours is an Administration based on charity and inclusiveness . We were elected under the Creole adage that all should sit at the table , not just a few . True , the gap between the haves and have-nots must be narrowed . But our agenda has never encompassed nationalization , seizure of property or encroachment on the legal rights of any Haitians , including those who enjoy tremendous wealth . <p> In the short seven months that Haiti 's democracy flourished , we worked to create a Government that was accountable for the first time in Haitian history . We resurrected an independent judiciary , an institution that had been destroyed and corrupted by previous regimes . We unmuzzled the press . We initiated an unyielding crackdown on drug dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free-market economy that could benefit all Haitians . In June , for the first time , a positive balance of $8 million was recorded in our national treasury , which had been virtually emptied by former regimes . <p> Those accomplishments will be at risk if the will of the people is allowed to be overturned . The answer is to act quickly and decisively to return the democracy for which the Haitian people have sacrificed so much . The trade embargo initiated by the United States with the Organization of American States must be resolutely enforced . Except for shipments of humanitarian aid to Haiti 's poor , the embargo should amount to a total blockade . <p> We seek a peaceful solution to our crisis through social dialogue among the different components of Haitian society . That is why we have requested that an O.A.S . civilian delegation be dispatched to the country as soon as possible to act as official observers . That is the only way to insure that the restoration of the legitimate Government in Haiti is carried out without compromise , within the framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Would-be coup leaders in other countries are watching the response to the assault on Haitian democracy with keen interest . The international community 's unwavering support for our Constitution and our democracy will nurture the blossoming of democracy all over the world . @@649975 Double Down <p> Jason Starr <p> I needed the six horse to win the fourth race at Belmont in a big way , but as the horses went around the far turn I knew it was n't happening . The six made the lead but he was all out and another horse , the nine , was flying on the outside . In mid-stretch the nine hooked the six , but the six dug in-just to extend my torture a little longer-and they went neck and neck past the sixteenth pole . <p> " Hold him off , you cocksucker ! " I yelled . " Get up , you fucking son of a bitch ! " <p> Naturally , I was wasting my breath . Seventy yards to the wire , the six hit quicksand and the nine drew off to win by an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursing , ripping tickets . The six was my big play of the day . I bet my lungs on it-five hundred win and another six hundred in exactas and triples . Yeah , I hit a couple cover exactas on the nine-six , but what would that get me , a hundred and change ? Big whoopy shit . <p> I rode the escalator to the second floor , went to the saloon , and ordered a J.D. straight up . I downed it in one gulp and asked for a refill . A guy sat next to me . He was my age , early forties , had a big gut and thinning gray hair . He was in an expensive suit and was wearing a Rolex . But he had a wannabe way about him . Maybe he was rich , maybe he was n't , but he wanted everybody to think he was . <p> He ordered a gin and tonic , then said to me , " How you doin ' ? " <p> At the racetrack when somebody asks you how you 're doing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think I 'm doing ? " I said , figuring I 'd let the fact that I was at the bar downing J.D. 's at two in the afternoon on a bright sunny day do the talking . <p> " Had the six in the last , huh ? " he asked . <p> " Tell me how he fuckin ' loses that race , " I said , getting aggravated all over again . " I mean , okay , the nine was good . But with the fractions he got , what , half in forty-seven and change ? He should 've won by open lengths . " <p> " Maybe he was a little green ? " <p> " Green ? Come on , give me a fuckin ' break . It was , what , his fourth time out ? Mark my words , that horse 'll never win a fuckin ' race , not at this track anyway . Maybe if they ship him up to fuckin ' Finger Lakes or some shit track he 'll break his maiden . " <p> My heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the way people probably felt before they had heart attacks . <p> " Well , thank God there 's five more races to get ' em back , right ? " <p> " Not for me . I came here to be the six horse . " <p> " And I came here to talk to you . " <p> During our conversation so far , I 'd been looking away and at my glass mostly , but now I looked at the guy in the suit and said , " And who do you think you 're talking to ? " <p> " Your name 's Jimmy Guarino , right ? " <p> He got my name right , but I said , " Who the fuck 're you ? " <p> I 'd been doing PI and protection work for eleven years , three on my own . I had n't made a lot of friends along the way and I never knew when somebody 's life I 'd fucked up would show up looking for payback . " DiMarco , " he said , extending his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake his hand , just asked , " The fuck do you want ? " <p> " Big Mikey said I could find you here . " <p> Big Mikey was a good guy , a bookie/loanshark from Staten Island . He grew up in my neighborhood-Brooklyn , Bay Ridge-and when I was a teenager I went out with his sister for a while . <p> " Sorry about that , " I said , feeling bad for treating him like shit . I smiled , trying to make nice , and said , " I hope you 're not looking for a hot tip , ' cause I 'm telling you right now , you came to the wrong guy . " <p> " I 'm not looking for any tips , I 'm looking for a good PI , and Big Mikey said you 're one of the best . " <p> " I always do what I 'm hired to do if that 's what you mean by good . " <p> " I was interested in hiring you to do a job . " <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his drink , swallowed hard , then said , " I think my wife 's fucking somebody . " <p> He sounded a little choked up , like it was hard for him to talk about it . I almost felt sorry for him . <p> " Take it from me , " I said , " guy 's been divorced three times . If you think she 's fucking somebody , she is . " <p> " Yeah , well , I want to know for sure . " <p> " Yeah , well , I 'm telling you for sure . " <p> He glared at me , then said , " I want the fuckin ' evidence . " <p> They always wanted evidence . I guess seeing was better than believing , or at least it made it easier to walk out the door . <p> But I did n't know why I was giving this guy marriage counseling . Cheating spouses were my easiest cases , how I made most of my money . I liked them because they were fast and uncomplicated . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got careless : writing incriminating e-mails , making long phone calls , doing public displays of affection . It was almost like they were begging to get caught , to get out of their shitty marriages . So I just took the pictures , got paid , and everybody was happy . <p> " If you want evidence , I 'll get you evidence , " I said . <p> " Thank you , " he said . " What do you take up front ? " <p> I usually took five hundred as a retainer , but I took another glance at the well-pressed suit , the gleaming Rolex , and decided to roll the dice . <p> " A thousand , " I said . <p> " No problem , " he said . <p> Fuck , should 've asked for two . Talk about nothing going my way . <p> He opened his wallet and took out a money clip . He peeled off ten hundreds from the wad and handed them to me . <p> I pocketed the money , then asked , " So why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's acting funny , " he said . " Been acting funny for a year , wan na know the truth . " <p> " Funny ? " I asked . " What 's funny ? " <p> " She does n't tell me where she 's been , sometimes I ca n't get her on the phone , shit like that . I swear to God , I do n't know how many times she 's told me her cell phone was n't working or she could n't get service . Shit like that . " <p> " Who do you think the other guy is ? " <p> " Got no fuckin ' clue , that 's why I 'm hiring you . " <p> I asked for the usual-his address and phone numbers , his wife 's work address , the time she left for work in the morning , the time she usually came , et cetera . <p> " And I 'll need a picture , " I said . <p> He opened his briefcase , took out a photo , and handed it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some guys came to me , worried their wives were cheating on them , and then I 'd see a picture of the old cow and think , What 's your problem ? You should be thanking God she 's fucking cheating on you . But Debbie DiMarco was a total knockout-wavy blond hair , dark tan , and somebody had paid good money for that rack . <p> " Good-looking woman , " I said . <p> " Do n't get any ideas , " he said seriously , like he really thought I wanted to bang his wife . I did want to bang her , but still . <p> " Take it easy , " I said . " It 's a compliment . You have great taste . " <p> I looked at the picture again , thinking , There 's no way in hell this broad ai n't cheating on this guy . <p> " Sorry , " he said , calming down . " I just get a little possessive sometimes , I guess . As you can see , she 's very beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I met her , but now she 's making me fuckin ' miserable . " <p> Jesus Christ , he was n't going to cry , was he ? <p> Yes , he was . <p> He dabbed his eyes with a napkin , then blew his nose into it . People were looking over . <p> I downed the rest of my drink , then said , " Look , I 'm gon na do everything I can to get you what you want , but just get ready because it probably wo n't be pretty . " <p> He stood up and looked at me , eyes all bloodshot , and shook my hand , squeezing much harder than necessary . <p> " Thank you , Jimmy , " he said . " I 'm really counting on you , man . " <p> He finally let go of my hand , and I walked away , letting Mr. Rich Guy pick up the tab . <p> I probably should 've left the track with DiMarco 's thousand bucks and considered myself a winner for the day , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " should 've done " ? Instead I went back downstairs and invested about two hundred bucks in triples and pick threes and watched the bets go promptly down the tubes as none of the horses I needed on top hit the board . This time there was no drama , no close calls . I just bet , watched , ripped . <p> In the next couple of races , I did n't fare much better , dropping another couple hundred . I knew it was happening , that there was no way I was leaving the track a winner , but I stayed and bet the rest of the card . I hit a nice exacta in the seventh race , which built up my stake back to about a thousand , but then I went banzai in the late double and walked out with about two hundred bucks in my wallet . <p> I knew the smart thing to do was to stop gambling and get right to work on the case , but I got in my car and drove right to Yonkers Raceway . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my car , driving home to Brooklyn , broke and feeling like shit . I knew this was n't any way to live my life , but I did n't know any other way to live it . I did n't smoke , barely drank , and never did heavy drugs , but I 'd been gambling for years , losing my money faster than I earned it . Sometimes I felt like I was falling , except , unlike a dream , I did n't wake up and find out everything was okay . My nightmare went on and on . <p> In the morning , I woke up and got to work on the car . I had no choice . I would 've loved to chase my money at Belmont , but I was broke and had rent and bills to pay . Business had been slow lately and if I had n't run into DiMarco at the track , I did n't know what I would 've done for money . <p> I lived in a ridiculously small apartment in Brooklyn , above a deli on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor of a tenement-style building . There was one room-my combination living room , dining room , and kitchen-and a tiny bathroom . I could n't meet clients there , so I did most of my business at diners , bars , and racetracks . I had no overheard and I did n't run ads . My business was all word of mouth and by referral . My only equipment was a laptop , a digital camera , and a gun . I usually left my gun at home , knowing firsthand what kind of trouble those things can get you into . <p> The DiMarcos lived in Mill Basin . When I got to the house again , I realized how badly I 'd fucked up by only asking for a thousand up front . The house was three stories , had to be worth a couple million . <p> But I already had an idea how I could make that lost money back and then some . <p> He said his wife went to the gym every day at seven fifteen and , sure enough , at seven fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better looking in person . She had great legs , like she could 've been a model , and looked like she was thirty , tops . <p> She got in her shiny red Merc and drove to the gym DiMarco said she 'd go to on Ralph Avenue . I was in sweatpants and T-shirt and followed her inside . I watched her head towards the women 's locker room ; then I went to the desk and told them I was thinking about joining and asked for a free day 's trial . The guy tried to make me fill out a form and wanted me to go into the office for a sales pitch . I did n't want to let Debbie out of my sight , so I promised the guy I 'd listen to his spiel after I worked out . Yeah , like that was gon na happen . <p> While Debbie used a StairMaster , I was right behind her , using an exercise bike . Let me tell you , it was a nice place to be . She was in great shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pedaling as slow as possible and I was still winded . <p> She did a half hour running on the treadmill while I did some pull-ups and very slow rowing . After she did about twenty minutes of abs and stretches , her workout ended , thank fucking God . If it went on any longer I probably would 've died . <p> She went into the locker room again , and came out about a half hour later looking all spruced up and perfect . Meanwhile , I was a sweaty mess because I did n't want to wash up and risk missing her leave the gym . <p> She got back in her car and I thought she was heading back to her apartment , but she turned down Avenue N and double-parked in front of a dry cleaner 's . She came out with the clothing , got back in the car , and then drove to Flatlands Avenue . She pulled into a gas station , filled up , then went inside to pay . Then she got back in the car and drove home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was on DiMarco 's tab , but I liked fast cases . I wanted to get my money , ideally today , so I could make it up to Yonkers for the early double . <p> For all I knew , she was going to stay in her house all day and I would just have to give up and come back tomorrow morning . But after about an hour , she left the house and got back in the car and I followed her onto the Belt Parkway , heading south . She was driving fast , weaving in and out of traffic . A couple of times I thought I lost her . <p> She exited near Brighton Beach and I figured she was just going to do some shopping or something . But instead she drove into the parking lot of a motel right off the Parkway . Suddenly things were heating up . <p> She got out of her car and went right to a room . My camera was zoomed in , ready to shoot . The door opened and , as she planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapping pictures , getting at least four good ones before the door closed . <p> So it had turned out to be an open and shut case after all . <p> The guy she 'd met seemed familiar , and then it clicked-he was the mechanic I 'd seen her talking to earlier at the gas station . <p> I smiled , then said out loud , " Guess she likes to get her tires rotated every once in a while . " <p> It was n't exactly hard to connect the dots of Debbie DiMarco 's story . She married a rich guy , got bored , and started screwing the hot young Guido at the gas station . <p> I took out my cell , about to call Andy DiMarco , when I suddenly had a better idea . <p> If I gave DiMarco the pics , he 'd pay me the balance due-a thousand bucks , plus another hundred for expenses . But I had rent and bills coming up , and the way my luck was going , that eleven hundred bucks was n't going to last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I knew exactly how to get it . <p> I drove back to the DiMarcos ' house and parked right in front . A couple of hours later , the red Merc pulled up into the driveway and Debbie DiMarco got out . As she passed by on her way toward her house , I said , smiling , " Have a nice afternoon , Miss DiMarco ? " <p> She stopped , turned , and looked at me suspiciously . <p> Before she could say anything , I said , " I 'll take that as a yes . " <p> She started to walk away . <p> " I think you 're gon na want to take a look at these , " I said . <p> She looked back slowly and saw me holding up the digital camera . " Who the hell are you ? " <p> I laid it all on the table-told her I was a PI , that her husband had hired me , and that I had pictures of her and the mechanic . <p> " Let me see them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slide show on the LCD screen . <p> " Why 're you showin ' me these ? " she finally asked , her voice trembling . <p> " Because I 'm a nice guy ? " " Fuck you . " <p> " Hey , is that a nice way to talk to a guy who might be able to save your marriage , or at least your ass in a divorce settlement ? " <p> " The fuck 're you talking about ? " <p> " These are your two choices , " I said . " I can give these photos to your husband and he can divorce you like he 's going to , or we can go on to plan B. " <p> " What 's plan B ? " <p> " I do n't give them to your husband . I delete them and you do the right thing and fix your fuckin ' marriage . " <p> " And how much is that gon na cost me ? " <p> " Five thousand dollars . " <p> " That 's blackmail . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " <p> Of course she bit , why would n't she ? Nothing like making a quick , easy five g 's . I felt like I 'd just hit the fucking triple . <p> She got back in her car and I followed her to the nearest Chase bank and she made the withdrawal . Before she gave me the money , she said , " Let me see you delete the pictures . " I deleted them one by one . Satisfied , she gave me the five large . <p> " Pleasure doing business with you , Miss DiMarco , " I said . <p> The next afternoon at the bar at Belmont , I met Andy DiMarco . <p> " Got good news for me ? " he asked . <p> " Depends what you mean by good . " <p> I handed him printouts of the photos I 'd taken . Before I 'd deleted them from the camera , I 'd uploaded them onto my laptop . I guess I could 've played it straight and told him his wife was n't cheating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five grand I 'd gotten from Debbie DeMarco and I wanted the one-grand balance from Andy DiMarco . In other words , I wanted to soak this thing for all it was worth . <p> Looking at the photos , DiMarco said , " I ca n't believe it . I feel like such a fucking idiot . I go into that gas station all the time . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
