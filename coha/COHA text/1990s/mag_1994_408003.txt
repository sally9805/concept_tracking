WHEN THE BANK OF MONTREAL introduced its Work - place Equity policy  --  a package of flexible work arrangements that includes such options as " flextime " and " flexplace "  --  in 1992 , Carole Charest and Helene Loiselle jumped at the chance to tip the balance between work and family back in favour of their children . The happy result ? Today secretary Charest hangs out with her kids on Fridays and administrative assistant Loiselle tacks Monday onto every weekend . The steps they took can provide some valuable tips to other women thinking of alternative arrangements at work . Present a well - planned proposal . " I was very clear about what would benefit me , " says 34 - year - old Charest . Certainly she 'd had plenty of time to contemplate alternatives during the daily , hour - long trek to her office in downtown Montreal . For three years , she 'd been shuffling her youngsters to preschool babysitters at 7 a.m . Evenings meant late suppers , baths and bedtime . She felt her kids deserved better . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and her department would benefit from her plan to reduce her work week from five days to four . While it would n't eliminate her extended hours , it would give her extra time to attend to her family 's needs . The bottom line : A happy , less - stressed mom equals a more focused , productive employee . Get your coworkers ' input . Helene Loiselle was quick to offer support to her colleague Charest . In fact , she figured a similar arrangement just might work for her . After all , she , too , had three children , a long commute and a hectic schedule . Both women agree that their co - operation , by choosing different days off , for example , and filling in when one is off sick , has been fundamental to the success of their arrangement . Figure not transcribed Consider the costs . Loiselle admits that finances were her major worry . She 'd been a bank employee for 16 years and her salary provided a degree of comfort to her family 's life . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she anticipated a reduction in her benefits as well . " When you look at the numbers , " she says , " it is a bit scary . " But with her husband 's support and the help of her boss , who was able to point out that only her vacation time would be reduced , Loiselle launched her four - day work week . A year into her plan she says , " When you look at the money you save by not working the fifth day , things are , in fact , much better . " Remain flexible . For both Charest and Loiselle , job commitment is key . So , for example , if a deadline is looming , they report to work on their day off . " Now , " says Charest with a laugh , " when we have to work that fifth day , our kids get very upset . " It 's a small sacrifice , they agree , for the better balance they 've found between work and family life . Doing It Right Here are five additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for alternative work arrangements : 1 . Find out if similar arrangements are already in place at your company . 2 .

Conversely , are there advantages to freeing up office space at your usual location ? 5 . Suggest a pilot project , outlining evaluation criteria and timing , and guaranteeing reinstatement to your old job if the arrangement does not work out . <p>
