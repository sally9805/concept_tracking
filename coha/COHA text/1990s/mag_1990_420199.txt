Section : THE ARTS MOVIES Three brilliant and bloody new gangster movies kick off a season of mayhem , molls and mafiosi <p> There 's a crime wave about to break across the nation 's screens . Hollywood has gone wild again over gangsters . Get ready for blood and mayhem  --  and some great filmmaking . The three best American movies of the year so far are about to open and all of them are about mobsters . The first off the block is Phil Joanou 's intense Irish-mafia saga State of Grace . Then comes Martin Scorsese 's stunning Italianate Good Fellas , followed by Joel and Ethan Coen 's singular period gangster movie Miller 's Crossing , which opens the New York Film Festival on Sept. 21 . <p> There are even more gangsters waiting in the wings . Late September will bring Abel Ferrara 's stylish " King of New York , " starring Christopher Walken as a psychotic contemporary Robin Hood . In October the Brits weigh in with their own true-life crime story , " The Krays , " an ambitious look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most eagerly anticipated Mafia saga of them all  --  Francis Ford Coppola 's " The Godfather , Part III . " <p> Is it mere coincidence that Hollywood has seized on the underworld this season ( and that a movie of E. L. Doctorow 's " Billy Bathgate " and a Bugsy Siegel film with Warren Beatty are in the works ) ? Or are filmmakers drawn to the violent world of the gangster because they see in him some reflection of life in the ' 90s ? From the first gangster movie in 1931 , when Edward G. Robinson got his just desserts at the end of " Little Caesar , " the professional hood has exerted a powerful hold on the national imagination  --  he 's the dark side of the American dream . In his oft-quoted 1948 essay " The Gangster as Tragic Hero , " the critic Robert Warshow saw this peculiarly American genre as a necessary antidote to the official cheerfulness of an egalitarian society . But Warshow was writing about movies of a simpler time , when the overreaching ambition of a Scarface was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The optimism of the postwar years has given way to uneasiness , cynicism and fragmentation . To most urban Americans , crime no longer seems a colorful , isolated subculture , but a fact of life . In the shaky ' 70s , the flip side of gangster movies dominated : this was the decade of the cop movie-from " Dirty Harry " to " Serpico . " The notable exception was Coppola 's two-part " Godfather " saga . It was a far cry from the fleet melodramas of the Jimmy Cagney era . Elegiac and aristocratic , this was a family epic disguised as a gangster movie . It was conservative in its tribute to old-fashioned familial values and subversive in its suggestion that organized crime is just a distorted mirror image of corporate capitalism run amok . <p> It 's obvious that Hollywood loves gangsters because crime pays  --  at the box office . Audiences find the gangster irresistible . He may terrify us but he also acts out our primal lust for power : individualism does n't get any more unbridled . Crime and punishment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real-life Mafia chronicle " GoodFellas , " the gangster is unrepent-antly ensconced in a Witness Protection program . Life , and crime , goes on . <p> Normal , law-abiding society barely appears in " State of Grace , " " GoodFellas " and " Miller 's Crossing . " We 're inside a closed , violent world , and there are no white hats in sight . But what 's fascinating is how unlike each other these three movies are . The Coen brothers have made a hard-boiled existential cartoon . Scorsese views the mafiosi world like an anthropologist with an absurdist sense of humor . Joanou aspires to tragic melodrama . You have to see them all to get the picture . <p> Of the three , " State of Grace " aims most directly at the gut . Joanou and his screenwriter , the late Dennis Mcintyre , drew their inspiration from the Westies , the savage Irish mafia that controlled New York 's Hell 's Kitchen . As the neighborhood underwent Yuppification in the ' 70s , the gang forged an alliance with the Gambino crime family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wild men , unreliable " cowboys " prone to drinking and chaotic explosions of violence . They did n't play by the old rules . <p> This fictionalized account turns the downfall of the Westies into an electrified Irish tragedy . The gang is headed by the coldblooded Frankie Flannery ( Ed Harris ) ; he uses his alcoholic , psychotic younger brother Jackie ( Gary Oldman ) as his enforcer . Their sister Kate ( Robin Wright ) , trying to escape her family , has fled into a respectable job uptown . She 's pulled back in when her old flame , Terry Noonan ( Sean Penn ) , returns to the neighborhood and starts working for the gang . As we slowly discover , he 's not what he seems to be , and he'scaught in a squeeze of conflicting loyalties . <p> Joanou has an intricate , beautifully built script to work from ( David Rabe did a lot of uncredited rewriting ) and he unfolds his charged story of violence , fratricide and betrayal with masterly assurance . This is only the 28-year-old director 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Clock High " and the documentary " U2 Rattle and Hum " ) . Here he makes a quantum leap as a filmmaker . He pulls off a great suspense sequence when the gang , drunk and confused , ca n't remember whether they 're supposed to rub out the Italian gang if Frankie calls them from a restaurant or if he does n't . You 're on the edge of your seat and laughing at the same time . <p> Assimilating bits of Scorsese , Spielberg and Sam Peckinpah 's balletic gift for carnage , Joanou gives us more than stylistic flash . With a great cast at his disposal , he pushes you deep inside these characters ' nightmarish reality . Penn gives a superbly controlled portrait of a guy in over his head and slowly losing his grip . He has n't been this good since " The Falcon and the Snowman . " Harris is chilling , yet he finds little crevices of comedy in his part : he 's great at playing a guy who 's not quite as smart as he wants to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role and he 's amazing ; this grungy , volatile maniac earns his place among the screen 's indelible nut cases . Scary as he is , you understand why Penn is drawn to him . At first Robin Wright 's sheer beauty strikes a false , Hollywoodish note . But Wright creates a memorable character , a tough , struggling woman who 's steeled herself against the brutality of her brothers and now discovers the man she loves poses another threat . <p> Modern-day Western : " State of Grace " is a riveting , hot-wire movie shot in cool , gritty colors by the gifted Jordan Cronenweth . By the time it reaches its flamboyantly violent finale , it has left naturalism far behind and become a kind of modern-day Western . Every step of the way , we 're held in its ferocious grip . <p> From Martin Scorsese we expect brilliant filmmaking , and " GoodFellas " delivers . He 's the perfect director to film Nicholas Pileggi 's " Wiseguy , " a fascinating true-life account of the life and times of middle-level Brooklyn mobster Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1955 at the age of 11 and ended up in the ' 80s testifying against his friends to the Feds . Scorsese and Pileggi , who co-wrote the screenplay , distill these four decades of larceny into the most abundantly detailed-and frequently hilarious-nuts-and-bolts account of organized crime ever put on screen . For Hill ( played by Ray Liotta , and as a kid by Christopher Serrone ) , becoming a gangster was his earliest ambition , and he relished every perk along the way . When his parents noticed he was n't attending classes , the mob took care of it  --  by intimidating the mailman so that no school letters ever got delivered again . <p> Scorsese observes this Mafia foot soldier 's progress with a poet 's eye for detail . Living in a totally self-enclosed society , these wiseguys and their wives and mistresses are an upside-down parody of untrammeled consumerism . " When we wanted something , we just took it , " Henry boasts . When Henry asks his wife , Karen ( the terrific Lorraine Bracco ) , how much cash she needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the width of the wad . Robert De Niro plays the neighborhood legend Jimmy Conway , one of the masterminds of the $6 million Lufthansa hoist at Kennedy Airport . But that mob triumph sets off Jimmy 's greed and paranoia  --  he systematically goes about bumping off all his partners in the crime . For all the " family 's " talk of loyalty , these guys are masters of the double cross . This is miles from the romantic , grandiose view of the Mafia the " Godfather " movies present . At first Scorsese startles us by playing violence for laughs , relishing the wiseguys ' bravado , but the tone gets subtly darker and more disturbing . By the end of his career , the cocky Henry has become a paranoid , coke-addled desperado marked by both the cops and his fellow crooks . <p> Way of life : Scorsese seems incapable of making a false move . He uses a lot of unconventional techniques  --  freeze frames , a double narration by both Henry and Karen , characters addressing the camera  --  but they never interrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Raging Bull " may miss the deeper , more visceral notes those films struck , but Scorsese 's after different game here-it 's a sociological epic , less concerned with plot than capturing a way of life . The texture is hot and immediate , but it 's told from an emotional distance , without moralizing . The performers are faultless . Take special note of Joe Pesci , who plays Henry 's lifelong pal Tommy , afunny , weaselly guy capable of the most terrifying outbursts of violence . Every crisp minute of this long , teeming movie vibrates with outlaw energy . <p> To go from the Mafia verisimilitude of the Scorsese to the deliberate artifice of the Coon brothers is like traveling to another planet . " Miller 's Crossing " is a true original , and all the more so for being composed from parts flagrantly borrowed from old gangster movies and novels . The Coons take the kind of " dirty town " tale Dashiell Hammett used in " Red Harvest "  --  with its crooked pols , ambitious crime czars , tough-talking dames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mysterious uses . Like their previous movies  --  " Blood Simple " and " Raising Arizona "  --  " Miller 's Crossing " is meticulously calculated and severely stylized , but their tone is new : darker and more muted , it teeters on the edge of parody and then turns somber . It 's about a man who may or may not have a heart ; the movie itself rarely shows its own . <p> The cool-customer hero is Tom ( Gabriel Byrne ) , the brains behind the town 's crime boss , Leo ( Albert Finney ) . Tom . loves Leo , but he also loves Verna ( Marcia Gay Harden ) , whom Leo wants to marry . When Tom confesses his sexual treachery , Leo banishes him ; and he goes to work for Leo 's Italian rival , Johnny Caspar ( Jon Polito ) . Caspar orders him to dispatch Verna 's brother , the egregious Bernie Bernbaum ( John Turturro ) , who 's been mucking up Caspar 's gambling deals . <p> Masterful manipulator : It 's only the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Tom sets thug against thug in a diabolically clever scheme to set things straight . But the tight-lipped loner never tips his hand about his motives  --  because he is n't sure what they are . He 's a masterful manipulator , and he becomes ultimately as vicious as the cretins he 's rubbing out . At the heart of " Miller 's Crossing " is a kind of riddle : it 's a character study about the mystery of character . " Nobody knows anybody  --  not that well " is Tom 's mournful refrain . The Coons , cinematic control freaks , for the first time plant the seed of ambiguity in their rigorously tended garden . It blossoms beautifully . <p> They have also given us one of the most marvelously written movies of the year . From the opening scene , a hilariously impassioned aria on the theme of " ettics , " delivered by the sweaty , dim witted Caspar , one revels in the Coons ' fabulously fabricated period argot . As visually splendid as " Miller 's Crossing " is  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movie you listen to . The actors have a ball with their larger-than-life parts . Turturro gives a virtuoso turn as the sniveling , devious homosexual Bernie , and Polito 's volcanic Caspar is a terrific comic creation . But it 's Byrne who anchors the movie with his quiet , stong presence , exuding a movie , star charisma he 's rarely shown before . <p> The Coons ' gangsters and grifters may have been dreamed up out of used movie parts , but they have a wonderful pop-up exuberance that resembles nothing you 've seen before . " Miller 's Crossing " is a contemporary dream of a ' 30s movie , a hard-boiled gangster flick that happens also to be a meditation on identity , loyalty and ethics . The Coons , like Scorsese and Joanou , hurl an old genre into new orbit . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A young director 's quantum leap : Joanou ( right ) and Penn <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Cool virtuosity : Joel Coen ( right ) with actor J.
