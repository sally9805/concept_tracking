Section : Walking Shoes Test Walking can indeed keep the doctor away , but you 'll get the greatest benefits if you walk fairly fast , far , and often . We tested 19 shoes for exercise-walking . <p> " The sovereign invigorator of the body is exercise , and of all exercises walking is the best . " Thomas Jefferson <p> <p> Many present-day Americans would agree with Jefferson 's advice to his future son-in-law . Walking is among the most popular ways to work off calories and strengthen the heart ; the National Sporting Goods Association estimates that about 25 million Americans walk for exercise at least 110 times a year . <p> The question is , do you need special shoes to do it ? Athletic-shoe makers have persuaded millions of walkers that they do : Between 1988 and 1995 , annual sales of walking shoes nearly doubled , to $2.8-billion . If you 're a dedicated exercise-walker , they 're right ; you 'll be most comfortable in walking shoes . Otherwise , athletic shoes you already own could be all you need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cross-training or tennis shoes might do . And if you run as much as you walk , just walk in your running shoes . ( See " Calling Imelda Marcos , " at right . ) <p> For this report , we tested 11 women 's and 8 men 's walking shoes . ( More women than men walk for fitness , and more women 's walking shoes are on the market . ) The facing page shows features to look for when you 're shopping . The Ratings list attributes of the models we tested . <p> On another note : Recent headlines have linked the making of shoes and clothes with sweatshops . ( See " Shoes and Sweatshops , " page 40 . ) In the lab , on the foot <p> The Ratings combine the results of lab tests and " road " tests using a trained panel of six men and six women . The highlights : <p> Stability . The ideal walking shoes keep your feet from rolling inward too much ( pronating ) as you walk . To gauge stability , we videotaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled foot movement quite well ; the top-rated New Balance 840 models were best . <p> Support . A walking shoe should feel sturdy and hug the foot . The men 's and women 's New Balance 840 and three other women 's shoes won top honors in a supporting role . <p> Shock absorption . When you walk , your feet strike the ground with a force equal to about 1 1/4 times your weight . A good shoe will keep that impact from being jarring . We measured shock absorption by opening up the shoe and dropping a weight onto its inside heel and forefoot ( where the greatest impact is felt ) . Five men 's and three women 's shoes earned top scores in shock absorption . <p> Flexibility . It 's a challenge for walking-shoe designers to combine flexibility with stability and shock absorption . Some met the challenge better than others . We used a machine to measure the force required to flex each shoe , when new and after a break-in period . Our panelists also assessed flexibility , and generally agreed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Rockport proved most flexible . Even the most rigid shoes will flex a little more as they 're broken in . <p> Breathability . A running shoe uses mesh in the upper as an escape route for sweat . Most walking shoes have a leather upper , less efficient at dissipating sweat . To test how well the shoes " breathed , " we tracked how much water evaporated from a soggy sock left in each shoe for 24 hours . Most shoes did just a fair job ; the Details on the models ( page 41 ) identify shoes to try if your feet sweat a lot . <p> Weight . This depends mainly on the midsole material . Ethyl vinyl acetate ( EVA ) is lighter than the usual alternative , polyurethane . None of the shoes we tested was especially light or heavy , and weight seemed to matter little in overall performance . <p> Other factors . Our panelists judged cushioning , which ranged from spongy to firm and is a matter of personal preference . Some shoes have a toe box that panelists found too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of arch support a shoe provides is most important to people whose arches are especially high or low . As a shoe is broken in , any pressure points tend to go away . Still , you 're best off choosing a shoe that does n't rub your Achilles tendon , press on the arch , or pinch anywhere . Air moving between midsole chambers ( in the Reeboks ) or leaking through a hole ( in the Nike Air Providers ) makes a soft hissing or swishing noise . It 's annoying , but it does n't affect performance . Only the men 's and women 's Nike Air Essentials claim to be machine washable . <p> For more information about these factors , see the Details on page 41 . Recommendations <p> If walking is your exercise of choice , it 's probably worth buying a pair of shoes designed for that activity . Use the Ratings as a starting point , and look for high scores in the test criteria that are most important to you . Overall , the men 's and women 's New Balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive , at $90 for the women 's model and $95 for the men 's . All the shoes we rated 2 cost $60 to $75 . <p> Whatever shoes you 're considering , follow this advice : <p> * Shop late in the day , when your feet are at their largest ; wear the type of socks you 'll walk in ; and try on both shoes . If your feet are different sizes , buy to fit the larger foot . <p> * Stand on tiptoe to make sure your heels do n't slip . <p> * Use your fingers to feel for seams and ridges inside the shoe . <p> * As you walk in the store , be aware of any rubbing or tightness . <p> Keep in mind that you can always try a shoe meant for the opposite sex . A men 's shoe is labeled about 1 1/2 sizes smaller than the equivalent women 's shoe ( a men 's 6 is a women 's 7 1/2 ) . The standard men 's shoe is also wider  --  a D , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shoes are based on a different pattern than men 's , to account for different proportions in the feet . The bottom line , however , is the same for women as for men : Buy what fits . Anatomy of a walking shoe <p> Below are features to consider when you buy walking shoes . Numbers are keyed to the Ratings on page 41 . <p> Tongue Most shoes have the usual type ( pictured ) , but 2 has a monotongue , a snug , socklike tongue you slide your foot into . It 's supposed to enhance fit , but our panelists found it made shoes hard to put on . <p> Laces Round ones ( 1,4,8,10,11,12,13,15 , and 19 ) are becoming more prevalent . They 're generally easier to thread and pull through eyelets than flat laces , but you may have to double-knot them to keep them tied . <p> Eyelets Typically holes . The fabric loops pictured ( 1,4,8,10,12,13 , and 15 ) are easier to use and even out pressure on the foot . <p> Achilles notch Relieves pressure on the Achilles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar Padded for comfort in all the shoes we tested . <p> Upper Generally leather , synthetic leather , mesh , or some combination . A high upper ( 1 and 12 ) adds support but may make the shoe harder to put on . <p> Toe box Should be wide enough for the toes to spread as you walk , long enough so there 's a thumbnail-long space in front of your longest toe . For shoes with an especially wide , narrow , or low toe box , see the Details on the models . <p> Midsole The cushioning material , usually ethyl vinyl acetate , that absorbs the impact of walking . It often surrounds such shock-absorbing agents as air cells . Some midsoles are thicker than others . A very thick one ( 8,11,15 , and 19 ) may make you feel somewhat " disconnected " from the ground . <p> Outsole The part that touches the ground , typically made of durable carbon rubber . Its texture and tread provide traction . <p> Insole Also called sock liner . Adds a measure of cushioning and arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning and can be replaced by another insole or an orthotic . <p> Reflective tab Provides varying degrees of extra visibility at night . 3,9,11,16 , and 19 lack a reflective tab . <p> Heel A heel counter stiffens the back of the shoe for stability . In 8 , 15 , 17 , and 18 , some panelists ' heels slipped slightly inside the shoe as they walked . <p> Rocker profile The concave shape of most walking-shoe soles , and found on all those we tested . It 's designed to help propel you forward . 9 has a bump designed for the same purpose , but some panelists found it annoying . Ratings &; recommendations Walking shoes Shopping strategy <p> Use the Ratings to narrow your choices , but be sure to try on shoes before you buy . <p> When to shop : New models are often introduced in January and July ; old models may go on sale around those times . <p> Where to shop : Find a store with savvy salespeople . Making sure the shoe fits is more important than saving a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of overall score <p> Ratings &; Recommendations : Walking shoes TABLE The tests behind the Ratings <p> Price is the national average , based on a survey . Overall score reflects lab tests and the judgments of our panelists . Stability reflects the shoe 's ability to control pronation , a foot 's rolling to the inside . People whose feet roll inward too much as they walk should look for high scores here . Support reflects the panelists ' assessment of how well the shoe hugged the foot . Shock absorption reflects lab measurements of the impact at the heel area and ball of the foot . Flexibility reflects how well the shoe flexed with the walking foot . Details on the models include sizes ( designations such as 5-10 include half-sizes ) , widths ( A through E or Narrow , Medium , and Wide ) , and weight ( for one shoe , in women 's 7B/Medium or men 's 9D/Medium ) . <p> Most of the shoes we tested : * Have cushioning that feels midway between firm and soft . * Scored Fair for breathability. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one color besides white , usually black .

Can you run in walking shoes ? Is there one kind of shoe that 's OK for every activity ? <p> Yes , sometimes , and no . <p> Yes , you can walk in running shoes , though their midsoles are designed specifically to absorb the greater shock incurred in running . <p> Sometimes you can run in walking shoes . We tried it in the men 's and women 's New Balance models and in the Nike Air Provider RWs , whose initials stand for run/walk . All those shoes proved stable enough that you could use them for a brief jog in the middle of your walk . For regular running , though , you need the shock absorption and breathability of running shoes . <p> No , there is n't one shoe that 's perfect for every exercise . Every athletic activity involves different kinds of movement and requires different combinations of stability , support , cushioning , and flexibility . Shoes for such court sports as tennis and racquetball need plenty of lateral stability for side-to-side moves . Aerobics shoes need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes need extra ankle support , flexibility , and cushioning ; for playing on asphalt rather than wood , they need heavy outsoles as well . <p> Cross-training shoes come closest to a universal shoe . They combine the features of running , walking , and court shoes ; but : as jacks of several trades , they are masters of none . If you do regular exercise of a particular type , buy the shoes designed for it . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> SHOES AND SWEATSHOPS . LOTS OF TALK ; WHAT ACTION ? <p> Tags inside the shoes we tested say that the Rockports and Etonics were made in Indonesia ; the others were made in China . What the tags do n't reveal are the conditions under which the shoes were made . <p> Nike , the world 's biggest shoe company , has received the most adverse publicity . Last spring , thousands of Indonesian workers making Nike shoes protested that their 20-cent-a-day incentive pay was cut when the country 's minimum wage rose to $2.50 a day . ( The incentive pay was reinstated . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said representatives of all the companies . They pointed to codes of conduct established by the companies themselves and by the Athletic Footwear Association , a trade group that asks its members ( which include the manufacturer of every shoe in our report except Easy Spirit ) to uphold wage , hour , and child-labor guidelines . But according to the Rev. Pharis Harvey , executive director of the nonprofit International Labor Rights Fund , which oversees workplace conditions world-wide , most shoe companies that manufacture in China and Indonesia use some form of sweatshop labor . That could mean extremely low wages , long workdays , a ban on union organizing , or unsafe conditions . <p> In April , a Presidential task force known as the Apparel Industry Partnership announced plans to eliminate apparel sweatshops in the U.S. and abroad . The partnership  --  made up of shoe and clothing companies , unions , and consumer , religious , and human-rights groups  --  proposed a workplace code of conduct : to pay the minimum or prevailing wage , prohibit child labor , allow workers to unionize , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the companies whose shoes we tested , Nike and Reebok are members . The partnership 's full report and membership list can be found on the Department of Labor 's Web site : www.dol.gov ; click on " No Sweat . " ) <p> By this fall , the partnership hopes to form a nonprofit association all U.S. apparel makers can join . Participants would agree to uphold the code of conduct , and their workplaces would be monitored independently , though the details have not been worked out . In turn , their products could carry a label shoppers could look for . <p> For now , consumers who support action to end unfair labor practices and who favor the use of a label can contact apparel manufacturers or write to Linda Golodner , co-chairperson , White House Apparel Industry Partnership , c/o National Consumers League , 1701 K St. , N.W. , Suite 1200 , Washington , D.C. 20006 . <p> THE HEALTH FACTOR : HOW WALKING HELPS <p> Some people do n't think of ordinary walking as exercise . However , as the U.S. Surgeon General reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like walking can yield huge benefits : reduced risks of heart attack , stroke , high blood pressure , colon and breast cancer , diabetes , arthritis , osteoporosis , and depression . <p> For the greatest health benefits , walks should push your pulse into its " target zone . " To estimate your zone , subtract your age from 220 , then multiply that number by 70 percent for the low end of the zone ( 60 percent for beginners ) and 85 percent for the high end . For someone 45 years old , that 's a range of about 125 to 150 beats per minute . A pulse rate below the target zone still yields some benefits . A rate above the zone , however , can overstrain the heart . <p> Though running burns calories faster than walking , people who walk are less likely to injure joints , tendons , muscles , and ligaments . You can reduce the risk further by observing some guidelines : <p> * If you 're over 45 years old , not used to exercise , or have a chronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any exercise program . <p> * Before your workout , walk slowly for a few minutes . Then gently stretch the muscles in your legs without bouncing or straining . After the workout , stretch again . <p> * In the beginning , walk short distances ; increase distance and speed as you 're able , a little at a time . A calorie count TABLE <p> 1 Figures are for a 150-pound person . <p>
