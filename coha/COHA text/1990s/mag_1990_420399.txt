<p> The British Medical Journal is 150 years old this autumn and has witnessed in its time a kaleidoscope of changing attitudes towards medicines , their ethics and efficiency . Peter Bartrip looks at its campaign against patent medicines at the turn of the century and the ambiguities of attitudes in the medical profession it reveals . <p> In my youth , said the sage as he shook his grey locks , I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment  --  one shilling the box  --  Allow me to sell you a couple ? Lewis Carroll , Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland ( 1865 ) <p> In 1832 a group of medical men from the English regions met in Worcester Infirmary , at the behest of a local physician , Charles Hastings , to form a professional society . They agreed to call the new body the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association ( PMSA ) , to publish annual Transactions and to meet each succeeding year in a different provincial town . Their avowed purpose was friendly and scientific ' , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession and to cultivate medical science . The association flourished , gaining more than 1,000 members by the end of the 1830s and over 1,900 by 1845 . Thereafter its fortunes declined for a time while members bickered over whether it should remain a purely provincial body or seek to become a national organisation based in London and representing the entire profession . In 1855 , with centralisation proceeding apace , it was renamed the British Medical Association under which title it became established as a formidable professional body and interest group to which , by the end of the century , over 18,000 practitioners belonged . <p> Throughout most of its existence one of the association 's main activities has been to publish a weekly medical journal which has been supplied as a subscription benefit to all members . The Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal was first issued in October 1840 . Initially it was an independent commercial speculation rather than the organ of the Association ' . It was not until 1844 that the PMSA acquired full proprietorship . During its early years the Journal , renamed the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership , a significant proportion of which regarded it as an expensive and unnecessary luxury . On several occasions it appeared to be heading for closure . Few editors could withstand the pressures of office for long and by 1867 there had already been six editorial regimes . Thereafter , the redoubtable Ernest Hart , who served as editor ( with one short break ) from 1867 to 1898 , established the BMJ as the most widely circulated , the largest and , arguably , the best medical weekly in the world . <p> At least until the passing of the Medical Act of 1858 , the organisation of the medical profession and the provision of medical care in Britain were in chaos . Anyone could call himself a practitioner and attend the sick . The public had no guarantee of the proficiency or probity of those whom they consulted , for there existed no body to exercise effective control over education and licensing or to warrant professional competence . The PMSA/BMA was closely involved in the struggle to change this position by outlawing quack practice and restricting the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuring that the sick were protected from charlatans , and regular practitioners properly recognised and rewarded . From the first , however , it realised that the suppression of the nostrum-mongers would be no easy business . Hence at its Bath meeting in 1838 the association 's Council reported that it was certain that no legislative enactment could be so framed as to prevent those who are ignorant from placing reliance on quacks ... it would not be easy to interdict the swallowing of their pills and potions ' . In fact , when the Medical Act was passed in 1858 it sought to prohibit the unqualified from passing themselves off as qualified but placed no other restriction on quack practice . Consequently , for rest of the nineteenth century and beyond , the BMA continued to campaign against the medical heretics , empiricists and pill-pushers . <p> The brunt of this campaign was borne by the BMJ for , until the twentieth century , when the BMA was reorganised , given a democratic constitution and a corporate presence which outlasted the duration of the annual meetings , the Journal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly attacked the activities of mesmerists , homeopaths , hydropathists and others , all of whom , it believed , should be prevented by law from practising . In the late Victorian and Edwardian period its special ire was directed at the patent ( more accurately , proprietary ) medicine manufacturers  --  very few secret remedies had ever been granted letters patent . <p> The origins of proprietary medicines may be traced back at least as far as Anderson 's Pills which were first sold in 1630 . But in Britain , Europe and America their boom age began in the nineteenth century . No reader of the Victorian press could avoid the plethora of advertisements for products such as Du Barry 's Delicious Health-Restoring Revalenta Aribica ' which promised , among other things , to restore : <p> perfect digestion , strong nerves , sound lungs , healthy liver , refreshing sleep , functional regularity , and energy to the most disordered or enfeebled , removing speedily and effectually indigestion ( dyspepsia ) , habitual constipation , diarrhoea , haemorrhoids , liver compliants , flatulancy , nervousness , biliousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noises in the head and ears , rheumatism , gout , impurities , eruptions , hysteria , neuralgia , irritability , sleeplessness , acidity , palpitation , heartburn , headache , debility , dropsy , cramps spasms , nausea and sickness , sinking fits , coughs , asthma , bronchitis , incipient consumption , scrofula , tightness of the chest , pains at the pit of the stomach , between the shoulders , &c.; <p> WHO 'S YOUR DOCTOR ? ' , asked a pithier advertiser in the same year ( 1866 ) , providing the response : Morison 's Pills ' . Proprietary medicines , it was implied , could do infinitely more for a patient than any mere practitioner . Indeed , no regular doctor could hope to compete against the rhetoric of Uncle Ponderevo ( in H.G. Wells ' Tono Bungay ) and his ilk . <p> It is easy to see why the profession objected to the quack medicine trade , for self-medication threatened to fleece and possibly harm the public whilst denying bona fide medical men the consultations and therefore the income they deserved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quacks were outlandish but , for most of the nineteenth century , subject to virtually no legal control . The most relevant legislation , the Pharmacy Act , 1868 , and the Sale of Food and Drugs Act , 1875 , which regulated the sale of poisons and drugs in late-Victorian Britain , specifically excluded patent medicines from their terms . Consequently , these preparations , the contents of which were usually a closely guarded secret , but which might in-clude poisons within the meaning of the 1868 Act , could be sold to the public without any restriction , save that of paying the government stamp duty . This duty , which dated from the eighteenth century , earned the Exchequer about 240,000 in 1892 . Many manufacturers cleverly hinted that the government stamp guaranteed the quality of their product . <p> Although the exact scale of the proprietary medicine business is obscure , it would appear that with ordinary opium preparations becoming more difficult to obtain and the disposable income of lower middle and working-class consumers increasing , it expanded rapidly during the second half of the nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in newspaper titles after 1855 was largely financed by quack advertising revenue and that by 1880 the patent medicine trade supported as many as 1,000 owners and 19,000 employees . Certainly , some producers made vast fortunes . Thomas Holloway 's success enabled him to endow Royal Holloway College in London ; the proprietor of Dr Williams ' Pink Pills for Pale People ' died a millionaire . <p> During the 1880s and 1890s Ernest Hart campaigned against proprietary medicines through the pages of the BMJ , achieving some minor successes , though not in his efforts to dissuade newspaper editors from prostituting their advertisement columns . . . to the service of a dangerous and often wicked class of imposters ' . But the issue was taken up more seriously and to greater effect by Hart 's successor as editor , Dawson Williams . Williams , who was appointed in 1898 , remained editor of the BMJ until 1928 , retiring only weeks before his death . Born in Ulleskelf in the East Riding of Yorkshire , he was educated at Pocklington Grammar School and University College Hospital , London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held several editorial posts before succeeding Hart . In 1902 he became the Journals first full-time editor . Williams , a far less flamboyant character than his predecessor , generally eschewed high-profile , campaigning journalism , his onslaught on the proprietary medicine trade being one of his few forays into this area . In attacking secret remedies his declared object was to alert the public to articles which are too often impudent and fraudulent deceptions ' end to persuade the government to abolish the stamp duty which conferred on quack medicines a spurious respectability . His tactics were to expose the quantity and value of a medicine 's ingredients and to reveal its likely benefit to the consumer . <p> The exposures began in December 1904 in an article on epilepsy cures ' They were based on analyses undertaken by E.F . Harrison , a pharmaceutical and analytical chemist who was then in private practice . The Journal revealed that medicines retailing at considerable expense , in one case 3s per 30z bottle , comprised ingredients worth no more than 1d . Subsequent reports dealt with headache powders , kidney medicines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deafness , piles , consumption , teething pain , gout , rheumatism , neuralgia , rupture , catarrh , coughs , colds and diabetes Among the firms whose products were castigated were Beecham and Veno as well as Munyon 's Homoeopathic Home Remedy Company , for whom Dr Crippen acted as the London agent . Beecham 's Pills , which were relentlessly marketed under the slogan worth a guinea a box ' were perhaps the best known of all the proprietaries . Thet were claimed to cure virtually any ailment from want of appetite ' to fullness of after meals ' and from cold chill to flushings of heat ' . A box of fifty-six pills retailed at 1s. 1d . Harrison found them to consist of nothing but aloes , ginger and soap ; he estimated that the cost of the ingredients needed to manufacture two boxes was about a farthing . <p> In 1907 Williams reported to a BMA committee that <p> the results of the analyst had not been challenged in any single instance , although they exposed the flimsiness of the claims mad by the proprietors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs usually of the cheapest and most ordinary description . <p> Later , the proprietor of a consumption cure , the notorious C.H. Stevens brought a libel action which was decided in the BMA 's favour . In 1908 the association decided to publish the BMJ articles in book form under the title Secret Remedies . What they Cost and What they Contain . Decisions were taken for an initial print run of 2,000 , a retail price of is. , and maximum expenditure of twenty-five pounds on advertising . The volume , published in 1909 , was a huge commercial success which yielded the BMA a handsome profit . The first two impressions sold out in less than a month , even though several newspapers , including the Daily Express and the News of the World , who were making good money from proprietary medicine advertisements , refused to accept advertising for the book . By June 1910 Secret Remedies had sold 62,000 copies . Two years later a second collection of analyses was published as More Secret Remedies . <p> The Journals attack on proprietary medicines has been described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade Lloyd George to impose a heavy tax on them in his 1909 People 's Budget ' . It also failed to drive them from the market , for these products continued to be widely advertised and , presumably , purchased and used . The campaign also had some unexpected consequences . At least one nostrum-monger artfully used the BMJ 's exposures to help sell his own cheaper and allegedly superior products . Some broken down ' individuals clipped the proprietary formulae provided in Secret Remedies and sold them at 1d a time . However , through its books , which apparently sold well at such outlets as railway station stalls , the Journal did alert the public to the foolishness of wasting money on useless nostrums . It also encouraged the government to change the wording of its stamp . Until 1911 this had borne the words : This stamp implies no government guarantee ' in what the BMJ regarded as rather inconspicuous print ' . In that year it was changed to No Government Guarantee ' in larger lettering . The Journal commented so far as it goes ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to look more deeply into the whole area of patent medicines and public policy . As a result a select committee was appointed in April 1912 . <p> This committee , which sat for over two years , found that while some proprietary medicines were genuine ' and unobjectionable ' there were : <p> many secret remedies making grossly exaggerated claims of efficacy ; causing injury by leading sick persons to delay in securing medical treatment ; containing in disguise large proportions of alcohol ; sold for improper purposes ; professing to cure diseases incurable by medication ; or essentially and deliberately fraudulent . <p> It deplored the absence of legal controls over the trade and proposed that manufacturers , proprietors and importers should be registered , certificated and inspected , while chemical formulae , ingredients and proportions should be divulged to the authorities . Furthermore , the advertising and sale of products purporting to cure a number of diseases and disorders , including cancer , consumption , diabetes , epilepsy and sexual problems should be prohibited . The BMJ was triumphant : <p> The British Medical Association may congratulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts pursued through many years , it is exceedingly unlikely that the Select Committee would have been appointed . The statements made with regard to the quack medicine trade by the Association and in the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL have been fully borne out , and a most important part of the inquiry and report of the Committee followed the line indicated by the articles on secret remedies published in the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL . <p> The select committee report was published in August 1914  --  in fact , on the very day that Britain declared war on the Central Powers . In the world crisis that was at hand the question of proprietary medicines quickly slipped out of view , though the Venereal Diseases Act , 1917 , did prohibit the advertising of cures ' for syphilis and gonorrhoea . But in general the proprietary medicine trade continued to flourish . In 1936 it was estimated that sales amounted to between GCP 12 million and GCP 15 million per year , while up to GCP 2.5 million a year was being spent on newspaper and magazine advertising . <p> Some areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control by the Cancer Act , 1939 , which banned the advertising of cancer cures , and by the Pharmacy and Medicines Act , 1941 , which did the same in respect to Bright 's disease , cataract , diabetes , epilepsy , fits , glaucoma , locomotor ataxy , paralysis and tuberculosis . Subsequently , only two chronic conditions remained commonly the subject of proprietary medicine advertising : rheumatism and asthma . But this still left a wide and profitable market to be exploited , particularly in such areas as slimming aids , tonics ' , and cures ' for coughs and colds . In 1946 , in a King-Hall Newsletter , Stephen King-Hall and Hugh Linstead , the Conservative member of parliament who was secretary of the Pharmaceutical Society , could still deplore the absence of government restrictions on exploitative nostrum-mongers , as well as the deception and fraud and gross exaggeration in many advertisements ' . <p> The concept of quackery presented by the BMJ and the BMA was unremittingly negative . Since the early nineteenth century the profession had sought to establish and demonstrate a clear divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles , and unqualified , incompetent , unprincipled mountebanks . But while the campaigns against the proprietary medicine trade have been presented , often by writers from within the BMA , as noble and selfless , the trade itself had a different perspective . It tended to see the profession as being intent on monopolising a right of treatment . It also argued that the profession failed to cure and , indeed , killed patients more regularly than did the so-called quacks . Some historians have shared these sentiments , arguing not only that quack remedies rarely caused harm ( unlike the ministrations of some registered practitioners ) and often exercised a reassuring influence , but that the divide between regular and irregular practitioners , to use the value-free language frequently found in recent historical work on quackery , was shallower than often thought . Indeed , in the midst of the BMJs campaign against secret remedies a question was raised as to whether the Journals own advertising columns were entirely free of such products . <p> The popular notion of a proprietary medicine is of one that is available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But proprietary medicine advertisements were also aimed at the medical profession , some exclusively so . Sanatogen and Enos Fruit Salts , for example , were advertised in the lay and medical press . Of course , the best way of gaining the attention of medical practitioners was by advertising in medical journals , especially those with large circulations . Some medicines advertised in medical periodicals were secret remedies , in that their composition was not revealed . As a result they could be prescribed by doctors ignorant of their contents , simply on the claims of their manufacturers . In 1906 , soon after the BMJ began its secret remedies campaign , George Simmons , the editor of the Journals American counterpart , the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) , wrote to Dawson Williams suggesting that the British Medical Journal was carrying advertising for secret remedies . Simmons , who explained that the AMA was running a campaign against secret remedies , named six preparations , four of which had been refused permission to advertise in JAMA , which had been advertised in the BMJ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices . Advertising revenue was highly important to the Journal for it received little income from sales ( since most copies of its copies were provided to BMA members as a benefit of subscription ) , while no part of association subscription income was earmarked for its needs . JAMA , which was allocated portion of AMA members ' subscriptions , accepted advertising only of medicines tested and approved by pharmacists working in AMA laboratories . Acceptance of advertising copy for the BMJ , on the other hand , was left to the discretion of the Journal 's medically unqualified business manager , Guy Elliston ; both before and after receipt of Simmons ' letter he accepted advertisements for medicines the ingredients of which were not disclosed . In 1910 , while the Journal was basking in the success of its secret remedies campaign , the National British Women 's Temperance Association appealed to it to stop taking advertisements for so-called medicated wines such as Wincarnis which often possessed twice the alcoholic strength of claret or hock . These wines , which the NBWTA described as one of the great class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the public ' were routinely advertised in the BMJ . As a result of these representations , subsequent copy from Wincarnis was rejected . But Elliston was worried that the multiplication of such decisions could provide the Journal with serious financial problems . Advertisements for some dubious products were rejected , but others continued to be accepted . <p> In 1912 continuing dissatisfaction with the BMJ 's policy on food and drug advertising prompted JAMA to vent its criticisms in its editorial columns . Secret remedies , it claimed <p> hold high revel in the advertising pages of high-class medical journals in Great Britain . . . Wherein is it any worse for the public to buy medicinal preparations about which it knows nothing than it is for medical men to prescribe medicinal preparations about whose composition they know nothing ? <p> By this time the appointment of the select committee had been announced . But JAMA predicted the inquiry would achieve little because those with an interest in the proprietary medicine trade would be in a position to resist reform by pointing to the practices of the medical profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee was its newly appointed medical secretary , Alfred Cox . When cross-examined he was given a very awkward time ' by the committee , especially by the two members who were newspaper proprietors . Under pressure he admitted that there were things advertised in the Journal of which he personally disapproved . Furthermore , he later confessed that some of the advertising carried by the BMJ was so worded as to make the critical attitude of the association to other Journals rather difficult to maintain ' . Another BMA witness , the dermatologist , Sir Malcolm Morris , expressed disapproval of many ' BMJ advertisements . But Elliston remained worried about the financial implications of rejecting large numbers of drug advertisements and the policy on acceptance underwent little change . <p> In 1924 the Canadian Medical Association voiced a complaint similar to that made by Simmons nearly twenty years earlier : <p> ... we have been endeavouring to do what we can to educate the physicians to the uselessness of . . . secret remedies . . . and have made an endeavour to have them excluded from our journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pay well and that they are appearing in the British Medical Journal . <p> Thirteeen years later a BMA committee found that the BMJ was still carrying advertising for medicines which had outlived their usefulness or were making claims which could not be substantiated ' . <p> Reconciling advertising and editorial policy posed severe problems for the BMJ over many years . In the 1950s , while it was publishing much of the research of Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill which began to establish a clear causal link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer , it continued to carry advertising for tobacco products . Desperate for advertising revenue , it sometimes failed to uphold the standards it expected of others . <p> In criticising proprietary medicine makers and carrying advertising for drugs similar to those it was exposing in its editorial pages it would be easy to accuse the BMJ of hypocrisy . But it might be fairer to view it as having struggled long and hard to achieve a policy which combined sound ethics with sound economics . It is well to remember that throughout the twentieth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ethical grounds . Although cigarettes continued to be advertised while the Doll and Bradford Hill research was being published , such advertisments ceased to appear in 1957 . The Journal also won praise for its handling of contraceptive advertising . In the 1930s contraception was a controversial issue over which BMA members were split . As a result the Journal Committee refused to sanction acceptance of contraceptive advertisements without the explicit approval of the Council . Once this was forthcoming , in 1932 , the BMJ began to carry advertising for chemical preparations approved by an independent adviser . In 1936 the National Birth Control Association , the forerunner of the Family Planning Association , commended it for accepting advertisements only for products of proven reliability . Some Roman Catholics , on the other hand , voiced strong disapproval . Such conflicting opinions epitomise the difficulties of running the BMJ , a journal in whose direction , John Delane of The Times once said , every BMA member aims a voice . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Medicine Jack  --  the pedlar of pills parodied in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHITE ) : ( Right to left ) The BMJ 's first offices at 161a The Strand in London , and its editors , Ernest Hart and Lawson Williams , who took up campaigns against proprietary medicines ( with an 1895 BMJ masthead below ) . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : ( Below ) An operation at Charing Cross hospital , 1901  --  critics of the BMJ 's campaign against patent medicines claimed that contemporary surgery was far more hazardous to public health . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Cures for everything ; a selection of adverts for proprietary remedies from around the turn of the century ; some of the products  --  including Eno 's Salts  --  are still with us ; others such as Dr Scotts Electric Hair Brush , are sadly not . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : O tempora , o mores  --  healthy smoking , according to this 1887 testimonial from Wilcox and Co . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Worth a Guinea a Box ?

Fearful that Labor-movement extremists would desecrate his corpse , Pullman left instructions that his lead-lined casket be covered in tar paper and asphalt , and laid in a massive vault of concrete reinforced with steel rails in Chicago 's Graceland Cemetery . Over this tomb stands a towering Corinthian column with the name " Pullman " carved in its base . Fortunately , the historical record beneath the other monument bearing his name , the town of Pullman , is far more accessible . In what is today Chicago 's far South Side , archaeologists are unearthing the remnants of a model community . Built to be " beautiful and harmonious , " it was intended to be a place where , in the words of its founder/strikes and other troubles that periodically convulse the world of labor would not need to be feared .

" It provides a chance to examine a rare instance of a working-class community of today rising up to save itself from the wrecking ball , " she says . <p> Pullman was designed with 900 " worker cottages " made of solid brick , more than 95 percent of which are still occupied today . In the center of town was a grand complex of commercial and industrial buildings , anchored by a corporate administration building topped with an iconic wood-framed clock tower . The town was also artfully laced with parks and gardens . <p> The London Times was not alone in hailing Pullman as " the most perfect town in the world , " at least until a nationwide economic depression compelled the town 's founder to lay off one-third of his workforce and slash the wages of the remainder by an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful homes , not to mention food and other necessities , workers walked off the job in the summer of 1894 . Their appeal to the fledgling American Railway Union , led by Eugene V. Debs , resulted in the union calling on its members to stop handling any trains that included Pullman cars . As Pullman all but monopolized passenger railcar operations , train traffic virtually came to a halt across the country . <p> Refusing to negotiate any kind of settlement , Pullman won the battle but lost the war . The strike petered out after a few months , due in no small part to aggressive intervention by the federal government . Public opinion , however , had turned against Pullman for his hard-line stance on his workers . A federal strike commission likewise laid much of the blame at Pullman 's doorstep , and the Illinois Supreme Court ordered him to sell off the residential sections of his town , his self-proclaimed " greatest work . " George Pullman died of a heart attack on October 19 , 1897 . His factory continued producing railroad cars until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession of industrial interests . <p> IN 1998 , a few years before DePaul launched an anthropology program with an emphasis on historical archaeology in Chicago , a homeless man had heeded the voices in his head that told him to set fire to the Pullman administration building . Although the clock tower was destroyed in the ensuing blaze , many of the original administration building 's 125-year-old masonry walls survived . Before reconstruction of the building began , site superintendent Mike Wagenbach wanted to make sure the effort would not destroy the sites subsurface historical record . In 2004 , DePaul visiting professor Bill Middleton took 16 students to Pullman to conduct targeted excavations at what is now the Pullman State Historic Site . <p> Middleton and his students found very little in the areas that would be impacted by the reconstruction , which allowed the work to proceed . The following summer , Baxter began working at the site . Laboring in the shadow of the recovering administration building , her 22 students spent five weeks learning to survey , map , excavate , record , process , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the underground tunnel through which power from an immense Corliss steam engine -- the most powerful in the world at the time -- was distributed to the manufacturing buildings and steam heat was channeled to public buildings and select residences . <p> Pullman has proved to be a gold mine for industrial archaeology . The one-of-a-kind Corliss , standing 40 feet tall and weighing 700 tons , was a big hit at Philadelphia 's 1876 Centennial Exhibition , for which it was initially constructed . Housed in a glass-fronted building in Pullman , it was just as big an attraction there until it was cut up for scrap when the company was electrified in 1910 , about the same time it made the transition from manufacturing wooden railcars to those made of steel . <p> Baxter is equally interested in the sociology of the workplace . " It seems obvious , but it 's often overlooked in industrial archaeology . People actually worked in factories , " she says . In 1892 , Pullman employed more than 6,000 workers ; about one-quarter were American born , and the rest came from nearly 30 different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges her students to consider . <p> On this front , too , Pullman does not disappoint . Outside two of the remaining factory door openings of the administration buildings north assembly shop wing , which survived the fire , the DePaul students found food refuse and fragments of ceramic cups and plates . Baxter surmises that lunch breaks were informal affairs , much as workers today might step outside for a smoke . Even more telling are the differences between two separate break areas . In one , unmarked 19th-century whiteware and cuts of meat ( evidenced by the animal bones ) are of a distinctly cheaper quality than that found in the other , suggesting that workers may have socialized according to class . <p> Even within a town that claimed to promote Utopian ideals , there were significant distinctions among Pullman workers . Beyond ethnic and religious differences , highly skilled craftsmen , including woodcarvers , cabinetmakers , blacksmiths , brass finishers , millwrights , and patternmakers , earned top dollar while unskilled laborers earned , in many instances , less than half that . And where an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or she could afford to pay in rent . High-wage earners tended to live in the largest , fanciest , and most expensive residences clustered around the town center . Low-wage earners lived in houses and multifamily dwellings , which , moving away from the town center block by block , grew steadily smaller , more plain , and less expensive to rent . The overall effect was a hierarchy of housing that roughly paralleled worker wages . <p> REGARDLESS OF THEIR PLACE in the town 's pecking order , workers would have passed by the largest and most ornate home in Pullman every day . Occupied by company manager H. H. Sessions , it was directly across the street from the main factory gate . According to an 1886 map , it was the only residence with a carriage house . A 1909 fire insurance map refers to the detached structure as a garage . Aside from one exceptionally poor-quality photograph , no other documentary evidence or living-memory exists of the two-story garage , though the house still stands . <p> Excavating the site -- for many years an informal parking area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still refer to as the Sessions House -- students discovered the previously undocumented limestone foundation of the carriage house . Measuring about 30 feet long by 20 feet wide , it bore a cutout large enough to receive power and steam from the Corliss engine , indicating that the building was heated . Befitting the buildings function , students found numerous **26;1408;TOOLONG artifacts , such as bits of horse tack and related finery . They also unearthed household items and remains of plumbing , suggesting a caretaker was in residence . <p> The most intriguing discovery , however , came before the students even started digging . Atop the site were heaps of displaced soil , which Baxter learned had come from the home of Kris Thomsen , two doors away . Like many Pullmanites , Thomsen can recite the history of his house chapter and verse , from the impeccably restored gem that it is today , to its central role as a speakeasy during Prohibition , to its original function as the home and office of John McClean , the company physician . In preparation to install footings for a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room/dispensary , Thomsen 's contractors excavated several buckets of soil and got rid of them where they thought no one would notice . <p> Fortunately , Baxter noticed and had her students sift through the dirt . In addition to an intact glass medicine vial , they found a cornucopia of personal items , including thimbles , glass marbles , hairpins , dish fragments , and even a small-caliber bullet casing . Most curious of all was what Baxter described as a disproportionately high concentration of buttons ; primarily shell buttons common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . <p> Company records reveal that McClean treated 4,155 injured factory workers over a 10-year period beginning in 1884 -- an average of more than one a day . The majority of injuries were serious enough to result in the loss of at least two days of work . " In your typical 19th-century industrial accident , " Baxter points out , " your arm or hand is caught up in a belt or some piece of heavy machinery and it 's not pretty . " McClean , a former Civil War battlefield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first he would have had to cut the clothing off the injured limb . The cloth , disposed of with other household trash in the large backyard , would have rotted away over time , but the buttons remained as reminders of the danger inherent even in so advanced a manufacturing setting as Pullman . <p> ON A BRIGHT , UNSEASONABLY MILD SUNDAY in late July , Baxter scheduled a public archaeology day as part of the 2008 field school . The event was particularly meaningful to the present-day residents of Pullman , including those who rose up in the 1960s when a local chamber of commerce recommended demolishing the entire 19th-century town for real-estate development . " That really got everyone in an uproar , " remembers George Ryan , who has lived in Pullman every one of his 88 years . " We had this big rally , people were standing up , yelling . We loved our community . For us , there was no better place to go . " Pullman was and is still a largely working-class community , but over the years residents have obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped preserve several key public buildings . <p> Twenty-five people showed up for the public archaeology day to carry on the legacy of community activism . Each volunteer was assigned to one of several student-led teams excavating the foundations of walls of the well-documented Arcade Building , one of the nation 's first indoor malls . In its heyday , the three-story structure housed dozens of shops , along with a post office , the Pullman Bank , a 1,000-seat theater , and an 8,000-volume library . <p> Among the amateur archaeologists was Andy Bullen , who lives in one of Pullman 's original " executive " houses with his wife , Linda . He developed and maintains the Pullman Virtual Museum ( www.pullman-museum.org ) , an online digital catalogue of images from several of the region 's archives . " To see the size of the foundation stones gives you this gut sense of the scale and mass of the building that you ca n't really get from pictures , " he says . " To stand on the sidewalk where the federal soldiers stood before the strike of 1894 -- personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being part of the great chain of continuity . " <p> As part of the 2008 field school , Baxter also had her students excavate a couple of present-day backyards , finding the remains of a previously undocumented root cellar and a smattering of personal items , including doll parts and china sherds that hint at the lives of 19th-century Pullman workers and their families . <p> - But after two seasons , Baxter feels she 's just scratched the surface . " The story of Pullman is not a simple one . It 's not just the autocratic patriarch versus his unhappy workers . It 's much more complex than that , much more subtle . But I need to investigate more . " <p> Pullman residents ca n't wait for her return . " With more archaeology , more study and information , " says Arlene Echols , who loved every minute the students spent excavating the backyard of her worker 's cottage , " we 'll all be better stewards of our historic homes , better stewards of our present community .
