<p> Gaze across the scar that once was the Berlin wall and both the past and future of Europe can be seen . <p> Fifty years ago there was one nation here and no wall . Twenty-five years later there were two nations and one wall . Today there is no wall again and one nation again . <p> Twenty-five years from now , no one is quite sure just what will be here . <p> Just as Berlin has been pulled in different directions over the years , so too will the rest of Europe be changing as the 21st century draws near . <p> " I think it will be a miracle if the map of Europe at the turn of the century is the same as it is now , " says Stephen Sestanovich , head of Russian and Eurasian Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) in Washington , D.C. <p> No longer will a simple geographic map be the only determining factor of Europe 's nations . When the 21st century arrives there also will be " new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic and social maps - all having an impact on U.S. policy . <p> " An unstable Europe would still threaten essential national security issues of the United States , " says Richard Holbrooke , assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian Affairs . " This is as true after as it was during the Cold War . " <p> By the year 2010 , issues that will affect the shape of Europe : <p>  --  Ethnic groups seeking independence or at least autonomy . <p>  --  Prosperous parts of existing nations attempting to jettison poorer sections . <p>  --  Larger , more viable nations extending spheres of influence over some neighbors . <p> " There will be a much more varied map that we have gotten used to thinking off , " Sestanovich says . <p> Changes that have taken place in Europe in the last four years - and those envisioned for the first part of the 21st century - are making everyone from diplomats to business people to map makers anxious . <p> " The transformations in Europe strike me as phenomenal , " says Elizabeth Crighton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor and European expert . " I do n't think anyone knows what will come . " <p> But Crighton and others have some ideas , including : <p>  --  The emergence of new nations as exotic as the Republic of Northern Italy , the Confederation of Luxembourg and Eastern Belgium , the Semi-Autonomous Basque People 's Republic , the Kingdom of Scotland , and New Dalmatia . <p>  --  A new shifting of borders in the former Soviet Union that would bring about the reincorporation of Belarus into Russia , a breakup of Ukraine , incorporation of Moldova into Romania . <p>  --  The rise of " economic nations , " where the economic influence of countries dictates political and social actions in countries with weaker economies Germany , which has muscle over Austria , Slovenia , Croatia and the Moravia part of the Czech Republic , is the most-frequently city example . <p>  --  A range of ethnic linkups across political borders , such as Transylvania and in the former Yugoslavia . <p> " It 's going to look a lot like the map of Europe around 1913 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're going to see continuing splintering taking place . " <p> Historically , the direction Europe takes often determines the path of the United States . <p> President Clinton underscored the U.S. tie to Europe on the first day of his first trip to the continent on Jan. 9 , 1994 : " Our bonds with Europe will be different than they were in the past . But make no mistake about it , the bonds that tie the United States and Europe are unique . " <p> Clinton made those remarks in Brussels , Belgium - an ironic choice since Belgium is a good example of a nation some say may not exist in its current form by 2010 . <p> Belgium is wracked by ethnic divisions between the Wallonis and Flanders sections - feelings heightened after the August 1993 death of King Baudouin , who kept things in order by granting the regions more and more independence . <p> " Its unity is somewhat questionable now , " says John Blodgett , a former U.S. envoy to the region . <p> One possible scenario : As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or regions break off to become independent entities . <p> Brussels - home to many European agencies , such as NATO and European Parliament - would remain an important city-state . <p> Such possibilities , while grist for pundits , are nerve-wracking for others . " We 're so busy trying to catch up we do n't have time to project , " says Markie Hunsiker , director of cartographical research for National Geographic . <p> In 1992 , the magazine made five major revisions to its world map - publishing it 14 times - and issued five supplemental maps , including one for Europe . <p> In 1993 , they did the map over four times , including an update to show the breakup of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia . A brand new Europe map came out in February , 1994 , and now the magazine is busy revising town names in Albania , Bulgaria and other regions for the next full update . <p> " We still call ( Serbia and Montenegro ) Yugoslavia , " Hunskier says . " And our maps call Macedonia ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's too long to put on the map . " <p> Now , Hunsiker and colleagues are watching 19 areas in Europe that look likely to change . " As soon as something gets resolved , we 'll map it , " Hunsiker says . <p> Headlines from Europe have been dominated by the vicious break-up of Yugoslavia , where four new nations have been carved out . But other factors could determine the face - and fate - of the continent : <p>  --  Germany : The strength of the German currency is giving Bonn more power in the region . German already is the most-spoken language in Europe . <p>  --  Islam : The more militant elements could cause major disruptions in nations with large Muslim populations , like France . Bosnia-Herzegovina could be used as a base for Muslim expansionism . And unrest in Algeria and elsewhere in Northern Africa could spread to Europe 's growing Muslim communities . <p>  --  NATO : Taking in new members - Russia , Hungary , Poland , the Czech Republic and others in the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations like Ukraine , where not everyone favors membership . <p>  --  Finances : The small nations that shelter banking deals and facilitate much of the flow of capital that greases European business - Liechtenstein , Andorra and Switzerland - could be shaken by laws that limit secret accounts . <p>  --  Maastricht treaty : Instead of bringing the continent together , the 1993 pact that aimed to solidify the European Union could spur nations to cut their own deals . Britain , from the beginning , has balked at some EU-wide plans , citing national sovereignty . <p> " The important thing now is , really , one has to talk to the culture , ethnic and history of the regions and not look in terms of East-West relations . That 's gone , that 's history , " says Janusz Bugajski , associate director of East European studies for CSIS . <p> " We have to construct a Europe of regions , where borders do n't mean much . It 's going to be a tremendously exciting decade , I would say . " <p> Celente - who sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or seven , Spain two - is not as optimistic . <p> " We 're going to see a very destabilized Europe , very xenophobic countries and an an alliance forming of Muslim nations that will resemble that of the Allies and Central Powers of World War I , " he says . " Europe is n't going to be the place to be . "
