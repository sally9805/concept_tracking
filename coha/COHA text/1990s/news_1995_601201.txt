<p> First , there was the $ 1 designer cookie . Then , the $ 2 multi-grain muffin . Next , the $ 3 cup of cappuccino . And now , the $ 4 loaf of fresh-baked bread . <p> Make that $ 5 if you want the dough stuffed with pricey ingredients such as fresh cherries and macadamia nuts . <p> America is becoming a nation of breadheads . Marketers are convincing consumers that it 's oh-so-chic to buy fresh breads like honey whole wheat and oatmeal poppy seed . Fresh bread looks and tastes healthy . And it smells like home . Never mind that the profit today 's bread boutique makes on a loaf of fresh bread often exceeds 200% . Some bread shops are selling more than $ 1 million worth of bread a year . That 's one reason fresh bread boutiques seem about as pervasive these days as frozen yogurt parlors . <p> " Consumers are flocking to bread boutiques when they could get the same product , probably for a lot less money , at the corner bakery , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade publication . <p> Fifteen years ago , the nation had fewer than 100 retail shops that specialized in baking fresh bread only . Today , there are more than 1,000 . The number could exceed 5,000 by decade 's end , industry analysts say . Bread boutiques that grind their own flour had combined 1994 revenue of $ 216 million - about 1% of the $ 18 billion in revenue for all bread . Total specialty bread sales in the USA will approach $ 6 billion this year - up nearly 10% from 1994 . <p> Simply put , Americans are devouring more bread of all kinds . The typical American eats 50 loaves a year . That will increase to 60 loaves by the end of the decade , projects the U.S. Department of Agriculture . <p> Such eye-popping numbers have coaxed unlikely outsiders into the business . Fresh bread can now be found at Price Club stores . Some Safeways sell baguettes reminiscent of those in a Parisian bakery . And fast-growing Boston Market - which recently purchased a fresh bagel chain - is considering entry into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not live on bread alone . Many sell homemade jams , pastries - even recipes . But bread is their calling card . A handful of chains are racing to become the McDonald 's of bread . Their names sound almost edible : Great Harvest , Big Sky , Au Bon Pain . <p> Some chains are enjoying revenue growth of about 20% annually . That growth is being fed by the insatiable desire of the Woodstock generation to eat something at least perceptibly more wholesome than the Wonder Bread many were raised on . <p> But buyer beware . " Upscale bakeries can be a lousy place to go for whole- grain bread , " warns Jayne Hurley , senior nutritionist at the Center for Science in the Public Interest . The four-grain bread sold by Au Bon Pain might sound like it 's made with whole grains , but its main ingredient is white flour , Hurley warns . And the company 's popular hearth bread has more yeast than it has whole-wheat flour , she says . CEO Ron Shaich insists the company 's breads are nutritious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of our breads have no fat and low salt levels . " Hurley applauds the honey whole-wheat bread made by Great Harvest , whose main ingredient is 100% freshly ground whole wheat . <p> " Fresh bread is a resolution to a terrible conflict that haunts most of us , " says Watts Wacker , a trend forecaster at Yankelovich &; Partners . " We want something both quasi-indulgent and quasi-healthy . " <p> Perhaps even more basic : Fresh bread makes people feel good . " The smell of bread fulfills a nostalgic yearning , " says pop psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers . The portion of the brain that perceives smell is very close to the area of the brain that stores long-term memory , she says . That 's why most fresh bread bakers leave their doors wide open - even in the dead of winter . <p> " When people get a whiff of our bread , they 're helpless , " says Sheri Edison , who , along with her husband , Glenn , owns and operates two Great Harvest bakeries in the Cleveland area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who asks . A slice often results in a big sale . <p> Consumer demand is n't all that is feeding the fresh bread frenzy . The baker 's way of life is attracting young couples burned out from climbing the corporate ladder . " There 's something very relaxing about coming into work at 4 : 30 a.m. , " says Glenn Edison , a former member of a prominent Cleveland law firm . " There 's nothing but you , the radio and the ingredients . " <p> Most newer boutiques are run by people who are not trained bakers . They learn on the fly , and the lessons are hard . Most work 18-hour days . There is little time to sit down . And the job is very physical . Just how many 50-pound sacks of flour can you lift in one day ? <p> That 's one reason Great Harvest , which is arguably the most successful chain of bread shops , advises would-be franchisees to carefully consider the pressures of the business . " It 's hard ; it 's hot ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ franchisees . " It will demand a huge chunk of you , and your marriage , and your family 's energy . " <p> Great Harvest has 88 bakeries in 33 states . It will add 20 this year . The Dillon , Montana-based chain expects to amass nearly 1,000 bakeries by the 2000 . But it all began on the side of the road in Durham , Conn . That 's where , on break from college 23 years ago , Pete and Laura Wakeman started peddling homemade bread from a card table . They 'd typically sell 50 loaves a day and go home with their pockets filled with money . " We were a big hit , " Pete Wakeman says . <p> The couple opened their first bakery in Great Falls , Mont. , in 1978 . The day they opened their doors , there was a line around the block . They sold out within an hour . <p> Since then , the company has grown exclusively through franchising . Its bakeries sold $ 32 million worth of bread last year . <p> Roger Elkus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of bread . The chairman of Big Sky Bread , which has 25 bakeries in 17 cities , still remembers how confusing it was when , as a 6-year-old , he 'd go to the bakery with his mom . " There would be these smiling ladies standing behind a display case , " he recalls . " But behind these ladies there was a wall . And it was always a mystery where the bread actually came from . " <p> That 's why the Cincinnati chain , which organically grows all of the wheat for its bread in Northern Montana , is testing something new at one of its Cincinnati stores : bakery as entertainment . Tables and chairs in the store 's dining corner have been elevated over the production area so that people can watch bread being made while sipping espresso . <p> Big Sky is considering going public - a move rival Au Bon Pain took in 1991 . But as a publicly owned company , the 250 store Au Bon Pain has expanded beyond fresh bread baking - especially in many urban locations where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " People do n't want fresh bread where they work . They want it where they live , " says Shaich , co-founder of Au Bon Pain . <p> Such mistakes have hurt the company on Wall Street over the past year . That 's why Au Bon Pain paid $ 23 million late last year to buy the St. Louis Bread Co . It will expand that chain in suburban markets even as it grows Au Bon Pain cafes in urban areas . The company projects revenue of $ 228 million in 1995 . <p> But it is the suburbs where most bread shops are heading . That 's where more consumers are generally willing to pay top dollar for bread . For about $ 5 you can get a 2-pound loaf of Great Harvest 's cheddar garlic bread , or a loaf of Big Sky 's whole-wheat bread made with fresh fruit . <p> Paul Castellano recently spent nearly $ 28 for nine loaves of bread at a Great Harvest bakery at an upscale suburb of Cleveland . But only three loaves were for himself . The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They used to bake their own bread , " says Castellano . " But since I started to bring them this , they do n't bother any more .
