<p> One curious fact about the Super Bowl replay Sunday when Buffalo comes to Texas Stadium to play the Cowboys : <p> Thurman Thomas will be there , and Emmitt Smith probably wo n't . Smith wants the kind of money from the Cowboys that the Bills are paying Thomas , $ 13.5 million over four years . <p> Smith 's absence was n't the reason the Cowboys lost 35-16 in Washington Monday night . His replacement , Derrick Lassic , gained 75 yards in 16 carries and did n't do anything horribly wrong . <p> The problem was the absence - in spirit , if not in body - of the rest of the Cowboys , who beat the Bills 52-17 in Pasadena last January . The whole team , in fact , played like Leon Lett on cruise control with Don Beebe chasing him down in the fourth quarter at the Rose Bowl . <p> " I saw a team that has a lot of holes to fill , " Jimmy Johnson says of his Cowboys . " I do n't want to be an alarmist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Super Bowl rings . There 's 27 teams out there waiting to take those rings . " <p> One , of course , is Buffalo , whose players still have bare ring fingers after three straight shots . <p> The Bills stumbled a little in their 38-14 win over New England last week , before scoring three fourth-quarter touchdowns . But the Bills still seem hungry - certainly hungrier than the Cowboys looked on Monday night . <p> " I really feel you do n't go around asking for respect or playing for respect , " says coach Marv Levy . " First , you 've got to respect yourself . Our players do . " <p> And the Cowboys respect themselves too much . <p> This week 's other major spectacle is in Green Bay , where Philadelphia comes visiting for Reggie White 's first appearance against his old teammates . <p> Other games are Chicago at Minnesota ; Detroit at New England ; Indianapolis at Cincinnati ; Kansas City at Houston ; New Orleans at Atlanta ; Philadelphia at Green Bay ; Phoenix at Washington ; Tampa Bay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rams ; the New York Jets at Miami ; San Diego at Denver ; and the Los Angeles Raiders at Seattle . San Francisco is at Cleveland on Monday night . <p> Philadelphia ( 1-0 ) at Green Bay ( 1-0 ) <p> Reggie 's not talking about the Eagles . <p> " I want to focus on this game and I do n't want this to affect the team , " he says . " If this were tennis or some individual sport , it would be different . " <p> White could have used a racket last week . He had just two tackles in a 33-6 win over the Rams , but just his presence seemed to make a difference . <p> It 's probably good for both teams that the game is being played in Green Bay . The city of Philadelphia has a way of getting revved up for marquee home games . The Eagles usually win them , then fade for several weeks , as they did last year after beating Dallas 31-7 on a Monday night that made the fourth week of the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We 'll try to keep it as much business as possible this week , " Packers coach Mike Holmgren says . " I know Reggie will be emotionally ready to go but there is a certain danger that you get so fired up , you ca n't think or function . " <p> One other note : Tim Harris , a troubled star in Green Bay , comes back as an Eagle after a trip through San Francisco . <p> Kansas City ( 1-0 ) at Houston ( 0-1 ) <p> Joe Montana 's wrist is sore but he 'll probably play , which can be good or bad news . The last time he played against a Buddy Ryan defense , he got sacked nine times , then threw four fourth-quarter touchdown passes for San Francisco . <p> Ryan is n't functioning at full throttle : the Oilers got just two sacks for two yards in the 33-21 loss in New Orleans and Ryan , who 's just the defensive coordinator , criticized the game plan afterward . Actually , Carl Smith , New Orleans ' much-maligned offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montana 's not the only banged-up quarterback . Warren Moon left the New Orleans game with bruised ribs in the fourth quarter , although he should be back . Houston , which had five turnovers against the Saints , faces a similar defense in Kansas City , which will probably get more from Neil Smith , who signed just before opening day . <p> San Francisco ( 1-0 ) at Cleveland ( 1-0 ) ( Monday night ) <p> Another quick trip to the AFC Central for the Niners , who took care of Pittsburgh last week . San Francisco lost two more players in that game , fullback Tom Rathman and defensive end Kevin Fagan , but the Niners always seem to be able to plug in new parts : rookie Dana Stubblefield had five tackles and two sacks against the Steelers . <p> The Browns finally got a TD from Touchdown Tommy Vardell , his first in two years . They 're at home for the second straight week , but that 's not an advantage against San Francisco , the ultimate road warriors - 31-8 on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) at Denver ( 1-0 ) <p> The Chargers , who opened with a dull 18-12 win over Seattle , have lost six straight times at Mile High Stadium . John Elway often seems to have career days against them . <p> These Chargers , of course , are a lot better than the old Chargers , particularly on defense . But they 'll need more than six John Carney field goals against Elway and his new offensive weapon , rookie Glyn Milburn , who scooted all over the Meadowlands last week in the 26-20 win over the Jets . <p> This week Elway gets one of his Three Amigos back : Vance Johnson , who re-signed with the Broncos after being traded to Minnesota and cut . <p> Phoenix ( 0-1 ) at Washington ( 1-0 ) <p> Stop Two on what could be Joe Bugel 's farewell tour is at the stadium where he made the Redskins ' offensive line famous . Bugel is probably gone unless he wins nine games this year and an 0-2 start is a push out the door . <p> " Before we start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Richie Petitbon says of his debut as the Redskins ' coach , Monday night 's 35-16 domination of Dallas . <p> For most teams , the next game after a big Monday night win is a letdown . <p> But the ' Skins do n't do thing like that - Petitbon was Joe Gibbs ' top assistant for a dozen years and knows the drill . Monday night was a legacy from Gibbs ( and Bugel ) - the remaining " Hogs " kept Mark Rypien untouched by the Dallas defense . <p> Detroit ( 1-0 ) at New England ( 0-1 ) <p> Barry Sanders has an offensive line and the Lions are a contender again - thanks in part to a lucky last-place schedule that gives them games like this and last week 's , a 30-13 win over Atlanta . <p> This is Drew Bledsoe 's home debut . He did reasonably well Sunday in Buffalo , 14 of 30 for 148 yards and two touchdowns , although he threw for just 30 yards in the second half of a 38-14 loss . <p> Bledsoe may get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Foxboro as it was in Buffalo . <p> " I did n't expect to be , but stepping out in front of 80,000 fans I got a little nervous , " he said . <p> Another reunion : Jim McMahon vs. the Bears . But McMahon 's been gone long enough that not many ex-teammates are still around . Nor is Mike Ditka , who ran him out of town . <p> One ex-teammate will be looking for him , though : Richard Dent , who is still in pretty good pass-rushing form . Given the battering McMahon took in the 24-7 loss to the Raiders and the Vikings ' offensive line problems , it could be an interesting reunion . <p> On the other hand , if McMahon gets time ... the Bears ' secondary hardly distinguished itself in the 26-20 loss to the Giants last week , giving up an 80-yard drive for a touchdown in the final two minutes . <p> Los Angeles Raiders ( 1-0 ) at Seattle ( 0-1 ) <p> Sunday night viewers will see a lot of defense here . The Seahawks managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss in San Diego . And the Rick Mirer offense picked up where the Stan Gelbaugh offense left off last year - the only Seattle TD came on a fumble return by nose tackle Joe Nash . <p> The mobile Jeff Hostetler may be the kind of quarterback who can play against Seattle . <p> He certainly did well against a good Minnesota defense , going 23 of 27 for 225 yards . That 10-yard average per completion is n't exactly the Raider way , which is to let the sprinters run deep , and throw long . <p> Tampa Bay ( 0-1 ) at New York Giants ( 1-0 ) <p> Dan Reeves did n't have many good things to tell the Giants after their win in Chicago . Or was he using reverse psychology to avoid a letdown against the Bucs and Rams the next two weeks ? <p> " We have the ability to get better , " he said , " but we have play like we are scared to death someone will beat us . If we do n't play like that , we 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care if it 's Tampa Bay this week or whoever . " <p> The way the Bucs played last week , it will take an awfully bad game by the Giants . Craig Erickson will get his first start this week in place of 39-year-old Steve DeBerg , which is one of the problems : there 's no middle-aged guy between Erickson and DeBerg , who should be a coach by now . <p> New York Jets ( 0-1 ) at Miami ( 1-0 ) <p> New York-Florida II with the Florida guys the big favorites . <p> Two old friends get together at quarterback , Dan Marino and Boomer Esiason . Both started well , although half of Esiason 's 371 yards in the 26-20 loss to Denver came after the Broncos loosened up their secondary with a 26-20 lead . <p> Marino , meanwhile , spent the first three quarters in Indianapolis getting used to his new receivers . He used the fourth to bring the Dolphins down the field for a 24-20 win , the 26th time in his career , he 's engineered a fourth-quarter win . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> This is a dangerous game for the Saints , who outplayed and outcoached the Oilers last week . Jerry Glanville 's teams are rarely consistent , but Glanville has the ability to get his team way up for a home opener against a traditional opponent . <p> On the other hand , Wade Wilson , the Saints ' quarterback , was a Falcon last year , and has an idea of the various blitzes he 'll see from the aggressive Atlanta defense . He picked apart a similar Houston unit last week , but like the Falcons , he 's inconsistent . <p> Indianapolis ( 0-1 ) at Cincinnati ( 0-1 ) <p> The records may be the same , but the teams are n't . <p> The Colts narrowly missed beating Miami last week , surrendering that last-minute Marino drive . This week , they do n't figure to be as vulnerable to David Klingler , who figures to get a lot of unpleasant on-the-job training this year . <p> Klingler at least starts . Jeff George 's holdout still lives him as a third-stringer with the Colts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 0-1 ) at Los Angeles Rams ( 0-1 ) <p> Neil O'Donnell is back as the starting pitcher for the Steelers , but it would help if his receivers could hold on to the ball . In last week 's 24-13 loss to San Francisco , wide receivers had five drops and four catches . <p> The Rams ? It looks like a long year . Linebackers Shane Conlan and Henry Rolling were both injured in last week 's 33-6 loss to Green Bay and Jim Everett looked like he did in the bad old days : 17 of 41 with two interceptions.
