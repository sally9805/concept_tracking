<p> A little-known rule could allow Colorado 's Andres Galarraga to win the National League batting championship even if he falls short of the necessary 502 plate appearances . <p> Galarraga is far ahead of the NL pack with a .392 average , but he does n't have enough plate appearances to be listed among the league leaders . A player needs 3.1 plate appearances per game his team has played . Galarraga is on the disabled list with 332 plate appearances . Entering play today , he would need 363 plate appearances because the Rockies had played 117 games . <p> But there is a rule that if a batter has the top average while being shy of 502 plate appearances , his final average can be computed by adding enough at-bats to reach 502 . <p> If that player 's average remains higher than any other hitter 's , he is declared the batting champion . Oddly , the winning average would be listed as the average before the hitless at-bats were added . The exception is if a hitter were at the .400 mark without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the .400 as being legitimate without enough plate appearances . <p> Galarraga could take an 0-for-25 add-on and have a .362 average . San Diego 's Tony Gwynn was hitting .353 through Friday . <p> " " I did n't know anything about the rule , but it throws a different light on the situation as far as I 'm concerned , " said Gwynn , who is trying for his fifth batting title . " " If that happens , that happens . I 've already got four ( batting titles ) in the bank . But if you 're Orlando Merced or John Kruk or Barry Bonds or one of these other guys , when they see that , they 're going to flip . They 're going to jump out of their shoes when they hear that one . " <p> Imagine if Bonds leads the league in homers and RBIs but is denied the Triple Crown because of this rule . <p> Galarraga is not expected back until September . He needs 170 plate appearances in roughly 35 games , about five per game . Rockies manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will use Galarraga as the leadoff man to help him get more plate appearances . <p> " " He 'll be the biggest leadoff man in baseball history , " Baylor said . <p> At least once this season , a reporter has noticed Astros manager Art Howe getting off the elevator before a game and theorized that he had been summoned upstairs to owner Drayton McLane Jr . ' s eighth-floor office in the Astrodome for a dressing down . <p> Howe had been in McLane 's office , but there was nothing sinister behind it . The owner has instituted meetings with Howe and the Astros ' front-office staff about once every two weeks . <p> " " We 've started a practice of meeting with ( general manager ) Bill ( Wood ) , ( assistant GM ) Bob Watson , Art and myself every other week , " McLane said . " " We talk about everything . Every player , the good and the bad . We 've opened the lines of communication . We have individual meetings and then a group meeting . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to see how they feel about things . I ask them , " If you owned the team , what would you do differently ? ' It 's funny because when you get them in a group , they do n't say much . But one-on-one , they all have strong opinions . " <p> Angels manager Buck Rodgers says he has learned his lesson about telling players to accept league-imposed suspensions for fighting . In June , he advised center fielder Chad Curtis to accept a three-game suspension without an appeal . <p> Last week , the American League reduced Toronto 's Ed Sprague 's suspension from three games to two and sat down Chicago 's Robin Ventura for two games for his charge to the mound against Nolan Ryan . <p> " " That will be the last time I 'll recommend anyone accept a suspension , " Rodgers said . " " I thought I was doing Chad Curtis a favor , but look at what happened . As usual , baseball backed off because they 're afraid of controversy . <p> " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) made a decision and backed off . In other words , he admitted to screwing up in the first place . We 've got to get some people in there who have some guts . They ( Brown and NL president Bill White ) had good intentions when they first took the job , but the system brought them to their knees . <p> " " I think once these guys leave , we 'll never have league presidents again . " <p> Rodgers had an interesting perspective on the resurgence of Florida reliever Bryan Harvey , who was left unprotected by the Angels in the expansion draft and has 35 saves for the Marlins . <p> " " When he 's on , like he was the other day when I saw him on TV , he just overmatches everyone , " Rodgers said . " " I 've never seen anyone like him . But remember , it took three years for him to develop . It takes time for these closers . Look at Harvey . He cost two managers ( Cookie Rojas and Doug Rader ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the Los Angeles Dodgers were losing four consecutive games at home to Colorado , manager Tom Lasorda called a pre-game team meeting . After that , the players closed the clubhouse doors for a session . Their mood was not positive . <p> " " Things are going just the same as the season has gone , " center fielder Brett Butler said . " " We have great days and bad days . There are players who want to play and players who do n't . <p> There are some players who get upset when we lose and other players who could n't care less . There are some who have given up on the season and others who wo n't give up until we are mathematically eliminated . <p> " " This is common for a losing team , but not for a winning team . A winning team is all on the same page . At times it 's been that way , and at times it has n't been . This is one of the lowest points of the season . " <p> Several players questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect Raul Mondesi was sent back to the minors after playing for about a month in Los Angeles . <p> " " There is a direction , and it does n't mean it needs to be ( playing ) eight players from our farm system , " general manager Fred Claire said . " " The goal is to both win and build , and it can be done doing both . Have we achieved that this year ? No . " <p> Since Bobby Thigpen saved his record 57th game for the Chicago White Sox in 1990 , he is 9-8 with 53 saves , a 4.41 ERA and has allowed 19 home runs . Thigpen lost his closer 's job with the White Sox and was traded to Philadelphia last week . He will be a middle reliever for the Phillies . <p> " " What 's different ? How have I changed ? That 's what we 're here to find out , " Thigpen said . " " To me , basically , the only difference between 1990 and now is the amount of work that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77 games . When I have a lot of activity , it works best for me . " <p> The Catch-22 is that unless Thigpen pitches better , he does n't figure to get the amount of work he thinks he needs to be at the top of his game . <p> NOTES : Neil Hohlfeld covers the Astros for the Chronicle .
