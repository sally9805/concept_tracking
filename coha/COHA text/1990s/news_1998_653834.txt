<p> Citigroup , shaken by leadership turmoil in its early days as America 's largest financial services company , has sped up the integration of its banking units in a headlong effort to prove that commercial bankers and investment bankers can mix . <p> In the weeks since the co-chairmen of Citigroup  --  the financial giant formed by the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group  --  ousted their heir apparent , Jamie Dimon , from his post , the investment bankers from Travelers ' Salomon Smith Barney investment banking unit have been ordered to find a way to merge most of their operations with the corporate banking side of Citicorp . Michael A. Carpenter , one of the two people charged with leading the combined bank , calls this " the third way , the Citigroup way . " <p> It 's certainly a new way . Investment bankers from New York to Sydney are moving in with their commercial-bank counterparts , putting their product lines together and making joint calls on corporate clients like the News Corporation , the Seagram Company and the Monsanto Company . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but executives are already talking about 100 potential new banking deals made possible by closer cooperation between Citicorp and Salomon bankers . <p> Integration appears to be happening faster  --  and reaching deeper into the organization  --  than envisioned in the earliest days of the merger . Like fingernails dragged across a chalkboard , the ouster of Mr. Dimon and one of his chief deputies , Steve Black , has silenced the open squabbling that divided Citibank executives from their counterparts at Salomon Smith Barney , many at the bank said . <p> But in the rush to meet a self-imposed year-end deadline to resolve outstanding conflicts , the merged company has also muffled important questions about how to balance vastly different commercial and investment banking cultures . <p> The fast pace of unification has pleased some within the company , who said they were surprised by how well the bankers from both sides had learned to work together despite leadership turmoil . Spirits are also higher as word filters out that Salomon bonuses , which many feared would be slashed from last year 's levels , will probably keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discord at the top confirmed their worst fears about the financial supermarket envisioned by Sanford I. Weill and John S. Reed , the co-chairmen . Some predict that the forced-march cordiality disguises smoldering battles , such as a continuing clash about the fate of the combined entity 's derivatives units . Many there are also consumed by nuances , such as whether the London-based Salomon bankers will move to Citibank 's offices in Canary Wharf . <p> " My impression was that to make the merger a success , they would never try to mush the two sides together , " said Susan Weber , a finance industry expert with Jaquish Advisers and a former investment banker . " I am surprised they are trying to do it . " <p> David Berry , a banking expert at Keefe , Bruyette &; Woods , said he saw the pitfalls in a quick marriage of the banking divisions , but also the opportunities . <p> Many analysts said that the most obvious synergies in Citigroup were on the consumer side of the business . The consumer banking , credit card , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much and open the possibility of cross-selling products through new distribution channels . <p> But Mr. Berry predicted that successful integration of corporate banking would initially add to Citigroup 's profits faster . <p> " Four big , new corporate deals would have an immediate impact on the bottom line , " he said . " If they can resolve the philosophical issues about how to organize the group , I think it has real potential . " <p> Whatever the outcome , Citigroup appears determined to challenge conventional wisdom . The company is crossing one of the oldest fault lines in the business , the one dividing banks that lend money to customers from banks that help customers raise money in financial markets . <p> The two types are known generically as commercial banks and investment banks . These days , those descriptions do not do justice to companies that fall somewhere in between . But there are still many in the industry who think of commercial and investment banks as East and West , the twain never to meet . <p> Traditionally , commercial banks provide loans and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for big stock and bond offerings . Commercial bankers get paid a salary each month . Investment bankers depend on annual bonuses for most of their income . There is some overlap , but year after year the biggest lenders are all commercial banks and the biggest underwriters are all investment banks . <p> From the start , Citigroup had to confront those doubts . But this merger seemed a better match than some previous ones . The acquirer was Mr. Weill , the Travelers Group chairman who grew up on Wall Street . <p> Many saw Mr. Weill as unlikely to allow his company 's freewheeling investment-bank culture to be swallowed by the by-the-book traditions at the larger Citicorp . The departure of Mr. Dimon , a protege of Mr. Weill for 15 years , shook that assumption . <p> One former Salomon Smith Barney official described it this way : " In the early days , the Citi people thought they had been bought . They were the Russians when the Germans invaded . Then came the long , hard winter . Now the Russians are counterattacking . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogy . He said that many at the bank believe they recently edged out longtime Salomon executives in one subtle but key contest : Citibank 's relationship officers will often take the lead in presenting a united face to their clients , offering them the full range of services available from the combined entity , everything from loans to advice on mergers and acquisitions . <p> Though they will often work side by side with their Salomon counterparts , it 's still an important victory . The Salomon bankers would have preferred to forge their own relationships with the 1,700 multinational companies in Citibank 's prized global relationship-banking list . That 's because the best-compensated investment bankers tend to be those with the tightest client relationships . Salomon bankers say their worst fear is to become merely " product providers " for Citibank clients . <p> " The distinction is blurring between Citibankers and Salomon people , that 's where we are going with this thing , " the Citibank executive , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said . " I am not saying that there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can continue doing things the old way will be looking for jobs . " <p> Mr. Carpenter and Victor J. Menezes , the executives named to manage the Citigroup 's corporate banking unit , dismiss such complaints . In a brief interview in the library of Citibank 's hushed Park Avenue headquarters , the two said they had taken a pragmatic approach . <p> No one model prevails , they said , adding that the degree of integration varies depending on product and geography . They would not impose a solution on corporate customers , they stressed , but allow customers to decide how they want their bankers to deal with them . <p> Mr. Carpenter carries around a progress report on the merger . On the plus side : A plan to unify the banks ' trust businesses has been reached , a compromise between Salomon 's sales-driven organization and Citibank 's big but slow-growing style . <p> On the other side of the ledger , he acknowledged that resolving how to combine Citibank 's autonomous derivatives unit with Salomon , where derivatives experts are meshed with the stock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he predicted a swift resolution . <p> The two executives claim to get along famously . Mr. Menezes , a Citibank career officer , is an avuncular Indian-American schooled in the bank 's textbook corporate culture . Mr. Carpenter , who briefly presided over the failed Kidder , Peabody brokerage firm before joining Mr. Weill at Travelers , is a London native who sat sideways on his chair in the library , legs dangling over the arms . <p> After scores of hours together , Mr. Menezes said , the two now think the same thoughts . " We can finish each other 's sentences , " he said , a challenge Mr. Carpenter took up by answering a question asked of Mr. Menezes . The two sometimes commute together to Manhattan from their suburban homes . <p> The closeness is not just cosmetic . The two executives said Citigroup was already generating more business than Citibank and Salomon Smith Barney would have alone . One example is Monsanto , a longtime Citibank customer for bank services but a client of Goldman , Sachs &; Company when investment banking was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing a $1 billion stock offering . <p> The harmony extends to bankers on the front lines , people at the company said . One unified team is the consumer products groups run by Christina Mohr , a managing director at Salomon , and Natica von Althann , a managing director at Citibank . " Our working relationship is seamless , " Ms. Mohr said . Agreeing , Ms. Althann added that " we have been at this for a few months and already we have repeated successes . " <p> The two teams handle clients together as long as the clients want it that way , they said . They described a recent approach that led to new business from one big client , the Rite Aid retail drugstore chain . " It 's a perfect example of 2 + 2 = 5 , how we can build on the strength of each relationship , " Ms. Althann said . <p> Still , other Salomon bankers describe the need for coordination as a distraction from client work . Some said that the Citibank structure , in which the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation from behind the scenes , results in regular mismatches with Salomon 's lead relationship bankers , who tend to be more senior . <p> And in some industries , others said , a unified Citigroup team can be a big disadvantage . Salomon investment bankers who work on deals for big commercial banks said they faced an uphill battle to persuade those banks that Salomon would keep client business secret from Citibank . <p> " Our new company is competing with virtually all our clients , " one banker said . <p> But perhaps the biggest problem is compensation . Salomon relationship bankers say they often make two or three times as much money each year as their Citibank counterparts  --  a disparity that becomes more glaring as the two gain the right to offer clients the same full line of Citigroup banking products . <p> Indeed , some rival bankers regard compensation as the weak link when commercial banks are merged with investment banks . <p> " No one has ever resolved this puzzle : How do you have high-priced bankers selling low-margin products , and ordinary bankers selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a competing bank . " It looks good on paper , but it blows up when bonuses are paid . " <p> Citigroup officials said they would resolve this issue as it arose , but played down its significance . " If we are generating big new fees , " one said , " how to divide them is a luxury . "
