<p> Larry Dorn , a stockbroker in Fergus Falls , Minn. , does n't have to look far to see why business is getting tougher . <p> Just down the street are three banks that once were valued clients . Now busy selling mutual funds , they 're among Dorn 's toughest competitors . " They 're coming at me , " says the 30-year vet . " The treadmill is going faster . " <p> The nation 's 86,000 stockbrokers are under siege : <p>  --  Banks , financial planners , no-load mutual fund companies and discount brokers such as Charles Schwab continue to take business from traditional stockbrokers . Last year , brokers sold 51% of stock and bond mutual funds , vs. 76% in 1985 . Over the same 10 years , full-service brokers ' share of stock and bond commissions fell from 95% to 86% . <p>  --  New sources of information have eviscerated brokers ' monopoly on investment advice . Krishan Goel , a pediatrician in Turlock , Calif. , keeps his office television tuned to the CNBC financial network so he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines started in the past four years - Smart Money , Worth and Mutual Funds Magazine - have seen their circulations boom . And , no-load fund companies offer free brochures and computer software . Example : T. Rowe Price has distributed more than 1 million copies of its retirement guide . <p>  --  Investors are more sophisticated - and more demanding . Baby boomers often do n't do business the way their parents did . They use financial planners who make their money from set fees - not commissions . Or they handle their personal financial chores through discount brokers offering on-line investing and 24-hour service . " I come up with most of my own investment ideas , " says Flint Harding , 39 , of Florence , S.C . <p>  --  Recurring scandals - such as Prudential Securities ' admission of criminal wrongdoing in sales of $ 8 billion worth of limited partnerships - have tarnished brokers ' image . In a 1993 survey , just 28% of those with a household income of at least $ 100,000 said they found brokers a useful source of information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny Fergus Falls , Dorn says he took some heat from neighbors after a Houston broker sold the city derivatives that lost half their value in 18 months . " I can not step out of this building from day to day without somebody asking me about this , " says Dorn , who was n't involved in the deal . <p> Indeed , gripes about brokers are soaring . Through the first quarter this year , the National Association of Securities Dealers logged 1,303 customer complaints , 19% more than a year ago . In July , brokers begin mandatory training aimed at ensuring they know what sales practices are legal and ethical . <p> A generation ago , brokers were known as " the customer 's man . " They were the link between Main Street and Wall Street . Their franchise : stock tips and access to the market . Individuals who wanted to buy and sell stocks had to go through them . <p> That world began to break down on May 1 , 1975 , when the Securities and Exchange Commission abolished fixed brokerage commissions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimize revenue swings from negotiated commissions , brokerages introduced products such as mutual funds , which brought in annual fees . Commissions , which accounted for 56% of brokerage industry revenue in 1973 , slid to just 19% by 1993 . And for brokers , the new products ignited broad job changes . <p> If brokers once were portfolio architects , today they are financial shepherds , steering customers and their assets to mutual funds and other managed investments . Instead of picking stocks , brokers - now called financial consultants or advisers at some firms - try to bring in as many assets as possible . Changing pay formulas and shrinking profit margins are behind that trend . <p> " There 's a risk you can lose touch with what 's going on in the market , " says Dan Jamieson , editor of Registered Representative , a trade magazine whose March cover featured a broker-as-dinosaur and the headline : " Is the stock and bond broker becoming extinct ? " <p> Earlier this month , an industry panel recommended to the SEC sweeping changes in the way brokers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to conflicts " with clients ' interests . <p> Clients pay a commission of 1.5% to 2% of a trade 's value each time they buy or sell stock through a full-service brokerage . Typically , the broker keeps 33% to 45% of the commission . The firm gets the rest . In 1993 , the most recent year available , the median broker income - half made more , half less - was $ 90,000 . <p> To critics , paying brokers for each transaction gives them an incentive for needless trading - or churning - in a customer 's account . " A broker 's got to make a living , " says investor Herman Borg , 60 , of Battle Lake , Minn . " If he can make you buy , he makes a commission . If he can make you sell , he makes a commission . " <p> The industry panel , which included billionaire investor Warren Buffett and Merrill Lynch Chairman Daniel Tully , urged firms to pay more closely to client asset growth . Some firms , such as PaineWebber and Merrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merrill Lynch broker 's pay depends on whether client assets grow . <p> Brokers say the changes are undermining their traditional skills . Walter Meanwell , 33 , a Kemper Securities broker in Madison , Wis. , notes that in 1985 , $ 10,000 invested in a Kemper mutual fund carried a sales charge of up to $ 850 . Today , he would gross $ 450 to $ 575 on that sale . And because of pressure from discounters , he haggles with clients over commissions . " My whole deal is to gather assets . Scoping out hot stocks ? I do n't have the time , the inclination or the skills , " Meanwell says . <p> Some brokers have other concerns . If an investment sours , they say , the broker may blame the fund manager instead of accepting responsibility . The direct link between customer and broker could fray . " I 'm sort of a dinosaur who does n't think I 'm doing much good for my clients by putting them with a money manager , " says Chris Pfaff , 43 , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger is that their skills will appear indistinguishable from those of financial planners , accountants or bankers . And the marketplace for financial advice is growing steadily more crowded . Of the 21,000 financial planners in the USA , almost half joined the business since 1990 , according to a report by Sanford C. Bernstein . <p> Brokers are betting their survival on aging baby boomers needing investment help as their portfolios become larger , and on two more amorphous concepts : " adding value " and " relationships . " At Merrill Lynch , brokers develop detailed financial road maps for clients . A sample provided by the firm was a 94-page hardbound report , swollen from charts and graphs . <p> At a price of $ 175 , the plan is a " money-losing proposition for us , " says Merrill 's marketing director Arthur Urciuoli . A comparable plan from a financial planner could cost more than $ 1,000 , he says . Merrill tries to attract clients with the plan and then sell them mutual funds and other products to implement it . Through frequent updates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients , he says . <p> Still , many investors remain wary . In response , the Securities Industry Association last year established a committee on public trust and ordered a poll of investors . " The industry 's track record has just not been good enough to say there is no problem , " says SIA 's Donald Kittell . <p> In this atmosphere , it 's not surprising that brokers sometimes require a pep talk . At a March conference , brokers flocked to a motivational speech by Stephen Barger , an executive with Primerica Financial Services . For more than an hour , leavening his remarks with quotations from Winston Churchill and Groucho Marx , Barger urged his audience of mostly young brokers to fight harder . <p> The mood was upbeat . But Barger 's conclusion was frank . " It 's not easy , " he said . " This is a tough business to be in .
