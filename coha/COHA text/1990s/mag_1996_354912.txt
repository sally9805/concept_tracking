The Eclipse , Galant and the new Spyder autos that roll off the line of the Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America Inc. plant in Normal , Illinois , some 140 miles southwest of Chicago , are virtually free of defects . They reflect a good combination of Japanese design , which stresses continuous improvement , and American assembly and engineering skills . <P> All the major defects , it seems , are walking around inside the plant . That 's what the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleges in charges filed against Mitsubishi three weeks ago , in what may turn out to be the biggest federal sexual-harassment lawsuit in history . If the courts rule in favor of the EEOC , the total cost to Mitsubishi in compensatory and punitive damages could theoretically exceed $150 million . The company has also been hit with a class action on behalf of 29 women , which portrays the Mitsubishi plant as a misogynous mix of sexist Japanese management practice and American blue-collar , bully-boy machismo . <P> Mitsubishi 's outraged and outsized response to the charges has sensationalized the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about 2,000 workers  --  given the day off for the purpose  --  demonstrated with supporters outside the Chicago offices of the EEOC last week . " Two , four , six , eight , " they chanted , " we 're here to set the story straight . " " Do we have sex on the line ? " one man shouted . " Do we get naked on the line ? " " No ! " the crowd roared . Some waved placards ; others unfurled a long banner that read EEOC PLEASE STOP SLANDERING ME . <P> But the demonstration may have turned a legal brushfire into a blazing inferno . Says Leslie Dach , executive vice president of Edelman Public Relations Worldwide and head of its Washington office : " They Mitsubishi have effectively shifted the dispute from the courts to the court of public opinion , where they are losing . " Shortly after the demonstration , Mitsubishi Corp . chairman Minoru ( " Ben " ) Makihara began sending signals about a settlement . M.M.M.A. is part of Mitsubishi Motors , which is itself part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 operating companies the Japanese call keiretsu . Top corporate executives fear that the troubles in Normal could reverberate throughout the group . <P> The charges have roiled the until now aptly named Midwestern town of Normal , where the plant has helped almost double the tax rolls and provided the kind of working-class prosperity that is fast fading from the American scene . Opened in 1987 as a joint venture of M.M.M.A. and the Chrysler Corp . ( which sold its share to Mitsubishi in 1991 ) , the $650 million assembly plant employs some 4,000 people , including 70 Japanese nationals  --  all of them managers  --  and almost 900 women . Assembly-line and maintenance workers make about $18 an hour and , with overtime and shift-preference pay , can earn annual incomes as high as $50,000 to $60,000.
