HE PLANNED IT . HE DID IT . MEET THE NEW KING OF CARS <P> H. Wayne Huizenga is driving in the passing lane . Since Jan. 1 , the billionaire entrepreneur has gone from neophyte car man to the nation 's biggest car retailer . His Republic Industries has bought up new- and used-car dealerships whose revenues totaled $2.7 billion last year . That will make Republic bigger than current numero uno Hendrick Automotive Group of Charlotte , North Carolina , with $2.3 billion , Automotive News reports . TIME first detailed Huizenga 's plans for a dealership-acquisition binge in December . Then , Huizenga , 59 , had little more than a blueprint and a shopping list . <P> Now , the man who built Blockbuster and trash collector Waste Management has acquired 36 dealers for about $550 million in stock . He 's also opened seven AutoNation and three ValuStop used-car lots . Wall Streeters expect him to spend $5 billion in three years buying dealerships , consolidating yet another mom-and-pop industry . <P> IN DENG 'S DEBT <P> Put this in the asset column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market reforms helped make China one of America 's biggest creditors . Awash in dollars from exports , China now buys more U.S. Treasuries than even the Japanese  --  $12.1 billion in U.S. notes and bonds through the first nine months of 1996 , vs. the $11.6 billion Japan purchased . China owns more than $43 billion of U.S. Treasury debt , the world 's fifth largest hoard , and moving up . <P> By investing in Treasuries , China is helping keep our interest rates low . On the other hand , money talks , and the Chinese might get louder when it comes to settling touchy disputes on trade  --  or Taiwan . Much louder . Last week Washington reported that America 's trade deficit with China jumped to an all-time high in 1996 to $39.5 billion , a gap expected to widen , giving the Chinese yet another fistful of dollars with which to go shopping for U.S. bonds . <P> AN AMBASSADOR 'S MISFORTUNE <P> How do you create a small fortune ? Start with a large one . The late Pamela Harriman , British-born U.S. ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her amazing social and political skills stood in stark contrast to her investing acumen . She seems to have squandered most of the more than $100 million she inherited from her third husband , New York Governor and Ambassador W. Averell Harriman . Her estate : some $15 million to $20 million , mostly in jewelry , property and art . <P> The Democratic doyen had already paid more than $10 million to Averell 's heirs , who had accused her and her advisers of blowing $40 million outright , including $20 million on a doomed hotel project in New Jersey . She also spent lavishly on herself . Alas , she did n't die smartly either . According to the Washington Post , she did not set up a trust to shelter the estate from taxes , so her heirs will receive a hefty bill from the IRS . <P> RADIO IS TUNED IN TO ACQUISITIONS <P> Sure , new media types are in love with Webcasting , but the hottest medium is Marconi 's . We 're talking radio  --  deregulation has put the industry in play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $15 billion . Some stations have changed hands three times .
