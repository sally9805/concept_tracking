<p> In the midst of the annual winter chaos known as the holiday season , it 's easy for a parent to begin to feel burned out . Carol Wolter , who used to provide day care in her home , can spot the signs in a minute . <p> " The parents consistently arrive at the last minute to pick up their child , " she says , " or they drop the kid off for 10 hours and decide not to go to work . They forget important things , like a change of clothes or medicine . " <p> They complain about colds that do n't go away , she said , and about being tired after eight hours ' sleep . " It 's not that they do n't care about their children , " Wolter says , " but they are doing too much . " <p> More parents are doing too much  --  and experiencing at least early stages of burnout as a result  --  than ever before , according to experts on the family . Despite the well-worn advice not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frighteningly more perfectionistic today , " says Joseph Procaccini , coauthor of the book " Parent Burnout . " " The word ' trade-off ' to them sounds like selling out . " <p> The experts base their opinions on the increasing number of child abuse cases reported each year , as well as on the clients they see . Washington-area parents , says psychologist Susan G. Mikesell , are especially vulnerable to burnout . " We 're not a laid-back group by any means , " says Mikesell , a mother of two who grew up in the Midwest . <p> Parent burnout , what Procaccini calls " a downward drift toward physical , emotional and spiritual exhaustion , " occurs gradually as the result of chronic high stress in the family and a perceived lack of control over what is causing the stress . Its symptoms are similar to professional burnout , but it 's harder to treat . <p> An unhappy worker can change jobs ; an unhappy parent ca n't switch children . " Parent identity is many times more profound than professional identity , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sommet Institute in Arlington , says parent burnout is often mistaken for depression , but is usually more severe and harder to overcome . <p> Procaccini , who runs the Center for Family , Work and Education in Columbia , estimates that as many as 50 percent of parents have experienced some form of burnout . Burnout occurs at all income levels and with any number of children , he says , when Mom or Dad have too much to do , too little time and too little support . <p> Parents have always complained about having too much to do , but the weak economy and altered family configurations give today 's parents real reason to complain , according to New York psychologist Herbert Freudenberger , who first used the word " burnout " two decades ago . <p> More parents must work outside the home , and work longer hours , simply to maintain a minimal living standard . Many go to school to keep their job skills competitive , even as they 're worrying about their company relocating or shutting down . <p> Elderly parents must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be living at home . Visits by the children of one 's first marriage also must be arranged and paid for . <p> " It 's incredible how many of these problems are coming down on people 's heads at the same time , " says Bob Simon , executive director of the Virginia Mental Health Association . " Middle-class parents think they 're confident and strong , but they 're not used to dealing with these pressures . " <p> Family experts say many middle-class parents , particularly the baby boomer generation , ages 31-45 , refuse to trim back their expectations . <p> Wade F. Horn , who runs the Administration for Children , Youth and Family in the federal Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , toured the country as a member of the National Commission on Children . Middle-class parents , including himself , he found , " always wanted the best . When we were younger , we wanted the best stereo equipment , and we got it . Then we wanted the best job and the best car , and we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Television ads , magazines and greeting cards reinforce , even promote , unrealistic expectations , Procaccini told a group of parents last month at the Sandy Spring Friends School . " Good " parents buy educational toys geared to age , and turn on the television for educational programs only . They expose Johnny to an array of sports and arts programs and then enroll him in two or three . They choose Sophie 's preschool carefully and interview dozens of babysitters . <p> And they worry that although they 're doing some things a lot , they 're not doing other things enough , like teaching their children to be honest , generous , responsible and tough . Procaccini writes in his book , " You feel that you are meeting your responsibility to maintain the family income ... but in doing so , you fall short of meeting your responsibility of guiding the moral development of your children because they are adopting someone else 's values . " <p> Parents only have to pick up a newspaper to read what happens if their children do n't adopt good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcoholism , drug use , teenage sex and violence  --  are well-publicized and frightening . <p> " My children are going to have to be a lot tougher-minded than I had to be , " says Michael Dana , a substance abuse expert for the federal government and father of two . <p> Parents such as Doni O'Connor , a former labor relations negotiator , approach child-raising with the same intellectual intensity they apply to their jobs . <p> " I want to provide them with all the ingredients they need to survive , " she says of her children , who are 2 , 4 and 6 . " But they have a lot of needs and I have to use different strategies with each . It 's so much harder than my old job , because I ca n't fire my kids . " <p> O'Connor transports her oldest to school and returns home to pick up the house . She checks to make sure her other two have n't exceeded their one-hour limit on television , runs her daughter to preschool and tries to persuade her youngest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone to some of the 50 people who work for her home-based toy sales operation . Afternoons are taken up with more child care , including homework , and preparing dinner . " I do n't want my children to think it 's easy to get takeout , " she says . After her husband , Bill , comes home and they 've finished dinner , O'Connor leaves to sell toys , arriving back home at 10:30 or 11 p.m. three or four nights a week . <p> Because her job is based at home , O'Connor believes she has more time with her children . Other parents are n't so lucky . <p> According to the HHS 's Horn , today 's parents spend 40 percent less time with their children than parents did in 1965 . Horn says that in his trips around the country parents cited lack of time as their biggest cause of stress . <p> And they look at the outside world as an alien culture that works against them . In his book , Procaccini says the foundering of social institutions " has left parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be totally responsible for the education of their children ; that the churches alone could not imbue a strong moral code in young people ; and that the streets of the community were more often a source of danger for the kids than a network of protection . " Many parents would say television is n't what it used to be either . Dana says he recently watched a rerun of " The Dick Van Dyke Show " with his 11-year-old son , and noted with amusement that Laura and Rob , although married , slept in twin beds . " That may have been going too far , " he says , " but at least parents had a feeling back then that outside forces were helping them . " <p> Procaccini , who holds a doctorate in business administration , began studying professional burnout in the late 1970s and found it especially common among nurses , teachers and others in the helping professions . In the early 1980s , he and Mark W. Kiefaber , a consultant , " started hearing a lot of people in their thirties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to go home and take care of all that stuff . ' One day one of us said , ' You can burn out as a parent too . ' " <p> Their work corresponded with the findings of other professionals . At AT &T,; for example , a survey of managers and executives found that children caused employees more stress and worry than anything else . <p> Procaccini , psychologist Freudenberger and others have devised steps parents can take to eliminate burnout or reduce its likelihood . Their suggestions include : <p> Keep a log for two weeks of what or who bothers you , where and when . Then make changes . <p> Be more realistic . For example , weeknights after work are rarely " quality time . " Do n't expect them to be . Spend that time with your children but make other time available as well , when you have more energy . <p> Learn to tolerate negative feelings about your child . <p> Plan at least a half-hour of downtime every day . Stop thinking of leisure time as wasted time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer , or reflection . <p> Encourage your children to do more housework . This teaches them responsibility and signals that you trust them . <p> Take short trips regularly with your family . <p> Seeking out other parents to confide in , especially parents with children older than your own , also helps , says Melinda Gipson , a Northern Virginia journalist and mother of two boys and stepmother of two more . <p> Gipson suffered from burnout last year . She and her husband , Pat Clawson , also a journalist , were struggling to make payments on old day care bills . The costs of seeing Clawson 's two sons , who moved to Biloxi , Miss. , were high . They could n't afford to buy a house . Any spare money they had went into office equipment  --  Clawson wanted to start his own business . <p> Gipson also was feeling professionally restless . She tried her hand at freelancing while holding down her job . At the same time , she had most of the responsibility for their two sons , then 5 and 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an only child and all-A student , had envisioned when she graduated from Northwestern University in Chicago . <p> " Last year was the nadir of our existence , " she remembers . " I was yelling all the time , at everybody . I also noticed tension in the kids ; they were picking fights with each other . I had trouble sleeping and , of course , that made things worse . " <p> Burnout signaled to Gipson that she needed to make some changes in her family life . She started sharing her problems with a Sunday morning discussion group at the National Presbyterian Church in Northwest Washington . She realized that a lot of her anger at her children was really anger at her husband , and the two of them began seeing a marriage counselor . <p> They made it through the year and now , although her responsibilities have n't changed , Gipson feels energetic enough to get involved in yet one more thing  --  planning the group 's agenda for next year  --  " how to have fun with your family .
