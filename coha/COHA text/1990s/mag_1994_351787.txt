First came the explosive charge . The defense team in the O.J. Simpson murder case , it was leaked , was planning to accuse one of the police investigators , Mark Fuhrman , of being a " racist " cop who may have planted the bloody glove found in the area behind Simpson 's guest house the day after the brutal slayings of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman . Then came the disclaimer . " Race is not and will not be an issue in this defense , " said Robert Shapiro , Simpson 's lead attorney . " The only thing we are looking at is credibility of witnesses . " <P> Maybe for Shapiro . But for nearly everyone else last week , the race issue emerged front and center in the Simpson case . After first focusing Americans ' attention on the issue of domestic violence , the Simpson drama is being transformed into a national teach-in on the gulf that exists between black and white attitudes toward America 's criminal-justice system . The shift came in a flurry of news leaks and public announcements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unearthed a 1983 lawsuit , brought by the Los Angeles detective seeking disability benefits , in which he admitted to harboring hostile feelings about blacks and other minorities . While Fuhrman denied charges that he planted evidence , Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti spent nearly two hours with black city leaders , trying to assure them that Simpson will get a fair trial . The civic leaders , in turn , urged Garcetti to integrate the all-white , all-male , eight-member panel that in coming weeks will recommend whether or not the prosecution should seek the death penalty for Simpson . <P> The defense team , meanwhile , was doing some integrating of its own . Just before Simpson was formally arraigned on Friday ( asserting confidently that he was " absolutely , 100% not guilty " ) , the previously all-white team was joined by Johnnie Cochran , the prominent African-American trial lawyer who represented Michael Jackson against charges of child molestation . Cochran 's arrival was regarded by some in the district attorney 's office as a defense coup . " Johnnie Cochran is a better trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserts one prosecution source . " Now add the race card . With Cochran in , you 're going to have a hell of a time trying to find a black juror who will convict . All you need is a holdout . " <P> The disparity between the races on the Simpson case is stark . In a TIME/ CNN poll , 63% of whites said they believe Simpson will get a fair trial ; only 31% of blacks felt the same way . While 66% of whites think Simpson received a fair preliminary hearing , just 31% of blacks found the proceeding fair . And 77% of whites called the case against Simpson " very strong " or " fairly strong " ; 45% of blacks judged it the same way .
