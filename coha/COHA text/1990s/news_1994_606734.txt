<p> As President Clinton concluded his announcement tonight that Haiti 's military rulers will step down , a half-dozen Haitians listening to the broadcast together smiled and quietly shook hands . <p> " This pleases me , " said an aged musician named Jedeo . " It 's good that they are going . " <p> A former army corporal named Giselle agreed that the news was indeed good , but he added that Haitians " will still have to wait and see " how the U.S. military occupation unfolds . <p> He said that as U.S. troops prepare to restore ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide to office , " the most important thing is what happens among the people . " If Aristide supporters " begin to attack their enemies in the army , " he said , " the soldiers will react , and we will have fighting even with the Americans here . " <p> Port-au-Prince was under curfew tonight , and there was no way to gauge how the majority of Haitians feel about the soft surrender of the military regime and the imminent return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton 's statement or in a televised announcement of the accord here by army-installed President Emile Jonassaint . <p> But for one Aristide ally , at least , the news was heaven-sent . " I think this is the last-minute miracle I was expecting , " the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste told the Reuter news agency . " I thank the God almighty for listening to our prayers , " said Jean-Juste , a Roman Catholic priest and former member of Aristide 's government . <p> Still , he added : " There are many people who will not be satisfied . It is true the army leaders could renege on their commitment , but they understand quite well that President Clinton means that there is to be no hanky-panky game-playing . " <p> Jonassaint  --  speaking alternately in French and Creole and seeming to shift personas as he did so  --  declared that by averting violence , Haiti will show the " international community the will , dignity and tenacity ... that will ensure the security of our country . " <p> American forces " were ready to come and wipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking it over ... we thought we could not permit the annihilation of Haiti to happen . " Jonassaint , who was named president by the military four months ago , ended his speech by assuring Haitians that they can " go to sleep knowing that no planes are going to bombard us . " <p> Meanwhile , in one of the city 's most violent neighborhoods , Carrefours , nightly gunfire that often signals attacks by army-backed gunmen on Aristide supporters stopped for about an hour as Clinton spoke . Then it resumed as usual , building from isolated gunshots to the staccato of submachine-gun bursts . <p> Earlier in the day , this teeming capital had slowed to a near standstill as it waited  --  quiet , shuttered and resigned  --  for the promised U.S. military intervention . Streets normally pulsing with life were cloaked in a somber stillness as thousands of Haitians fled the city and thousands more stocked up on food and water to await the arrival of American troops  --  whether as invaders or as guarantors of a peaceful political transition . <p> The only stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside army headquarters here , where former president Jimmy Carter was urging Haiti 's ruling triumvirate to step aside , members of the impoverished nation 's rich and powerful elite led a few hundred demonstrators in shouting defiance . As a dozen TV cameras whirred , the crowd chanted slogans against U.S. intervention and the man the operation would return to Haiti , Aristide . <p> But the noisy crowd demonstrated something else as well  --  the deep class divisions within Haitian society . Most of the protesters were fashionably dressed young men , while occupying the choicest vantage points  --  atop late-model cars and pickup trucks  --  were mulatto women from wealthy families that supported the military regime and the old Duvalier dictatorship before it . <p> At the back of the crowd , poor Haitian men  --  their hands gnarled from heavy labor , their feet in plastic sandals  --  watched curiously but did not join in the sloganeering . The rich and poor did not speak to each other . <p> " The situation is terrible , " said a well-dressed woman named Regine , who was perched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer . " Because of the American oppression against us , I can not buy my children schoolbooks ; we can not even go to the beach . We will fight the American soldiers , and many of us will die . " <p> But beyond the protest scene , Port-au-Prince was hunkered down . " Fight them ? " exclaimed one man in wonder . " No , we will go home and wait for them quietly . " He was sitting with a group of laborers at one of the many street corners where people were jamming into  --  and on top of  --  buses and trucks headed for the provinces . <p> At one corner , several men fiddled with the inert engine of a rusting white bus bearing the legend " Thanks to the Eternal , " which was bound for Cap-Haitien , on the northern coast . Under a searing sun , passengers inside were packed so tight that at least 70 were wedged up against the windows , unable to move . Another 15 were sprawled across a heap of luggage on the roof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Masses of people have been leaving in the last two days , " said the bus conductor , who gave his name as Robert . He said his bus had taken about 180 people to Cap-Haitien since Friday and guessed that nine other buses and trucks plying the route had carried similar numbers . Wheezing buses and tumbledown vehicles of all sorts have carried hundreds and thousands more Haitians from Port-au-Prince to the nation 's half-dozen other main cities in recent days , Robert said , " and they are all returning almost empty . " <p> Andre Pierre , a 26-year-old engineering student , said he thought he would be safer at home in Cap-Haitien if there were an invasion . " There , I know who is who , " he said , adding that he would " feel more secure " in his home town if Haiti 's violently opposed factions try to settle last-minute scores before American troops arrived . <p> The flight to the countryside left the capital 's usual Sunday gathering spots eerily silent . A downtown market that usually bustles with shoppers was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the city 's Roman Catholic cathedral  --  normally crowded for Sunday Mass  --  were sparsely attended . " So many of our worshipers have left town to wait for the Americans , " said a woman named Martine . " I will stay , but I have extra food and water at home , so I can wait here . All my neighbors are doing the same . " <p> The attitude of most people here toward U.S. intervention is colored by the history of Haitian-American relations . U.S. troops landed in Haiti in 1915 to halt political chaos and stayed until 1934 , having repressed repeated uprisings . <p> " That was colonialism , " said a bus station worker named Jean-Pierre , who , like many Haitians willing to talk with a reporter , gave only his first name . " The American soldiers were all white , and they did not treat black Haitians equally . " <p> Since then , however , Haiti 's people and culture have become more closely entwined with those of the United States as more and more Haitian emigrants take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States or knows somebody who does , " said Alex , a middle-class business manager . " And now there are a lot of black Marines  --  and even Haitian Marines . ... And culturally , we share a lot with them . You know what ? Now we have borrowed even rap music . " <p> Jean , 54 , an unemployed Aristide supporter , agreed that most Haitians have little to fear from a new U.S. military presence here . " This intervention is not like in 1915 , " he said . " They are bringing back our president ; of course we want them to do this without violence . " But if Aristide opponents attack U.S. troops , Jean said , " then , of course , they would have to defend themselves . "
