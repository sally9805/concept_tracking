Who made the switch from the calendar of Julius Caesar to the one we use today ? BY JOHN SCOTT // Christopher Clavius , S.J. ( 1538-1612 ) // " WHEN DID PEOPLE start counting years beginning from the time of Christ ? " On the night that Christ was born only a few shepherds keeping night watch over their sheep on a surrounding hillside were made aware of the fact . How many centuries crept by before the terms A.D. and B.C. came into use ? Who made the switch from the calendar of Julius Caesar to the one we use today ? The story begins with the task of keeping time . For many people through history the moon was a natural clock . The moon takes approximately 29.5 days to orbit around our planet . The time required to make this trip is called a lunar month . Lunar months were used by Jews and Turks in reckoning time . Egyptians also used lunar months . Not only does the month belong to the moon , but , derivatively , the week ; for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in each of these quarters we still keep its feast as Moonday . The ancient Hebrew lookout man sounded his trumpet at first sight of the moon to signify that the month had begun . Even today from the tall and stately minarets of Islam the watch is kept for the streak of gold that will release the faithful from the month-long austerities of Ramadan . Since the moon rotates around the earth once in approximately 29.5 days , 12 lunar months give a lunar year of approximately 354 days . This is 11 days shorter than the solar year , the period in which the earth revolves around the sun . The Jews reconcile their lunar year with the 365day solar year by periodically slipping a 13 - month leap year into their calendar . Instead of having nondescript names for the months such as we have , the Sioux Indians of South Dakota were more realistic and poetic . January was the " Moon of Frost in the Tipi , " February-the " Moon of the Dark Red Calves , " March the " Moon of Snowblindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appearing , " May the " Moon When Ponies Shed , " June the " Moon of Making Fat , " July the " Moon of the Red Cherries , " August the " Moon When Cherries Turn Black " ( not the type you buy in the supermarket ) , September the " Moon When Calves Grow Hair " ( buffalo calves born in early spring now grow a heavy coat of hair as protection against the coming snows of winter ) , October the " Moon of Changing Season , " November the " Moon of Falling Leaves , " December the " Moon of Popping Trees " ( frost on cold winter nights makes the trees pop or " explode " with a noise like a rifle shot ) . Did you ever reflect on the fact that the most important day in the church calendar is controlled by the moon ? Most of the great feast days of the church take place on definite days . The annunciation of the Lord is March 25 . The assumption of Mary into heaven is Aug. 15 . The birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox . The reason for this choice is that the Gospels mention that the resurrection took place on a Sunday during the Jewish Passover . This method of keeping track of Easter was established by the Council of Nicea in 325 . Earlier Roman citizens used a calendar based on the founding of Rome . In 12 78 of this Roman calendar Pope John I wanted a calendar that would show the dates of Easter in years to come . This complicated task was given to an abbot by the name of Dennis the Little . After some seven years of work Dennis came up with his new calendar in " anno Domini nostri Jesu Christi DXXXII ( " the year of our Lord Jesus Christ 532 " ) . It was A.D. 532 . Dennis calculated his calendar based on the birth of Christ . He " preferred to count and denote the years from the incarnation of our Lord in order to make the foundation of our hope better known . " Despite his best efforts , Dennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Christ was born around 5 or 6 B.C. And the calendar of Dennis was not accurate . The main culprit for the error is planet earth itself . Our planet is a sluggard and does not complete its trip around the sun in 365 days . There are about six hours left over . By the 16th century these " leftover days " had amounted to such a staggering total that the calendars were getting out of step with the seasons . In 15 79 Pope Gregory XIII decided to replace the " out-of-date " calendar with an accurate one . But an accurate calendar demands accurate astronomical observations . Upon the highest point of the Vatican grounds inside the city of Rome , Pope Gregory built the Tower of the Winds , and there the first Vatican Observatory was mounted . The Jesuits , under the leadership of Father Christopher Clavius , were called to make the observations that would serve as groundwork for the new calendar . Christopher Clavius , Sj. , ( 1538-1612 ) has been called by the historian of science George Sarton " the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he won the title " Euclid of the Sixteenth Century , " and as a physicist he won the respect and friendship of Vieta , Kepler , Galileo , Tycho Brahe and others . Clavius 's task of calculating the time of the vernal equinox and correcting the shift was enormous , considering the meager astronomical and mathematical resources available at the time . This was long before the invention of most of the mathematical tools we take for granted today . It was a time that preceded the common use of the decimal point , when long division was considered a college course . The accuracy of Clavius 's calculations has earned him historical fame . He found the correct date for Easter and also that 97 days had to be added to the calendar every 400 years to absorb the fraction of a day left after the 365 days of the year . The wonder is that he was able to measure the year 's length so accurately . To this day no one knows how he accomplished this . It took 800 pages to explain and justify his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time an extra full day will have to be added will be the year 4317 . In order to bring the calendar into sync with the seasons , Clavius had to omit 10 whole days and nights . Thursday , Oct. 4 , 1582 , was followed by Friday , Oct. 15 , 1582 . Clavius " stole " 10 days-the greatest daytime robbery in history ! The new calendar was not an immediate and universal success . The populace became disoriented . Windows were broken in the houses of European Jesuits , who were blamed for the change . The Orthodox Church saw it as a Roman intrusion . Protestant countries were reluctant to accept any decree from a pope . Europe was a patchwork of dates as people struggled with different calendars . This resulted in an interesting array of travel adventures . If you left Catholic Regensburg in Germany on April 8 , you would arrive in Lutheran Nuremburg 60 miles away on March 29 . England did not accept Clavius 's calendar until 1751 , while Orthodox Russia would require the Bolshevik Revolution before it changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I I days were then skipped from the calendar , with the result that we celebrate George Washington 's birthday on Feb. 22 even though he was born on Feb. 11 , 1732 . When Alaska was annexed its calendar had to be changed . Many citizens of that era objected to the supposed loss of the time from their lives . Does one pay a full month 's rent for the month from which the days were omitted , for example . " Give us back our fortnight , " they cried . Today Clavius 's calendar is virtually universal . Without it our calendar would now be about 13 days slow . Since the calendar we use was introduced to the world in 1582 by Pope Gregory M it is called the Gregorian calendar . With equal truth it could be called " the Jesuit calendar " or " the calendar of Father Clavius , Sj . " The next time you look at the calendar on your wall remember that it is a gift from a Jesuit . 0 Author Affiliation JOHN SCOTT , S.J. , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
