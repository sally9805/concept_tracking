<p> Last year , officials of the Roman Catholic Church 's obscure liturgy commission here realized that when Hong Kong returns to Chinese sovereignty they will be sitting on an explosive cache  --  volumes upon volumes of letters from members of the underground Catholic Church inside China . <p> Fearful that if the letters fell into the hands of Chinese officials they would jeopardize the safety of thousands of Chinese Catholics loyal to the Vatican , the Hong Kong church officials decided to ship the documents outside the territory for safekeeping , a source in the church here said . <p> The move reflects the quiet anxiety among Hong Kong 's 620,000 Christians as China prepares to take over this British territory of 6.3 million people Tuesday . China has promised to respect religious freedom in Hong Kong as set out in the new Basic Law , and has exempted religious organizations from new rules barring local groups from having foreign links . But throughout the rest of China , Christians who fail to pledge loyalty to the Communist Party and its Communist-run church organizations risk imprisonment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Given the ' liberal ' way in which Beijing interprets laws , will it not also try to restrict religious freedom ? " <p> " We have our own bottom line as believers , " said Roman Catholic Bishop John Tong in this city , where people are obsessed with bottom lines and where they build up to the heavens instead of praying to them . " We do n't want to find conflicts , but if we have no other way , we will follow God and follow the church . " <p> For now , Hong Kong church leaders say they are confident Beijing will live up to the letter of Basic Law provisions that guarantee freedom of religious belief and religious activity . Tong , Bishop Joseph Zen and several other church officials have accepted invitations to the handover ceremony . <p> They were reassured in part during a visit in May to Beijing , where Tong and Zen discussed the fate of the church in Hong Kong with officials from the Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council and with the United Front Work department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches in China . <p> " We had a very friendly and frank dialogue with Chinese officials , " Tong said . He declined to give details but added : " We were n't talking about the stock market . " Sources familiar with the church here said the Religious Affairs Bureau and United Front department told the bishops they will not set up offices in Hong Kong . <p> Nonetheless , potential conflicts loom over a host of issues , including visas for foreign missionaries in Hong Kong , local church groups ' links with underground and house churches in China proper , the curricula of Hong Kong religious schools , the content of religious magazines and newspapers , and rental costs of church lands that were essentially free under British rule . <p> Last year , a fuss broke out when an official of the New China News Agency complained that the World Lutheran Congress had failed to get Beijing 's permission before scheduling a meeting here for July 8 of this year , one week after the handover . After a local outcry , the news agency  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  backed down . <p> For the Catholic Church , which has lived under communist rule in Eastern Europe and other regions , the role here will be familiar . It will walk a delicate line to avoid conflict with the powers in Beijing while retaining as much freedom as possible to conduct services , classes and the business of the church and to serve as a bridge between the Vatican and Catholics in the Chinese interior . <p> Pope John Paul II 's appointment of Zen last October as the bishop who will eventually run the Hong Kong diocese was one example of church maneuvering . Zen has been teaching at a government-approved seminary in Shanghai for several years ; his contacts with China are good . At the same time , his appointment by the pope preempted any dispute over the Chinese Communist Party 's role in the selection of bishops after July 1 . <p> " The problem that I see is not about the church in Hong Kong , it is about our relationship with the church in China ; that will be difficult , " Zen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a church publication . <p> " Because if you insist on ' one country , two systems , ' then they will tell you , ' Come on , we respect your system ; you must respect our system , ' " Zen continued . " Then imagine , in the case of the persecuted church , I know one province in China where they local officials put the bishop and priests into prison and even beat the priests . What should we do ? We ca n't just keep silent . Those are our brothers . But if we say something , Beijing will say ' You are interfering in our system . ' That will be difficult for us . " <p> The task is delicate in part because the lines between what is allowed and forbidden in China are more ambiguous than at any time in the past 40 years . When the Communists took over in 1949 , Christian churches in China were dominated by foreign missionaries . Through their services and schools , they had developed substantial followings throughout the country . <p> In the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiated a " patriotic " church movement and forced churches to report to the United Front Work department . Many Chinese Christians fled to Hong Kong . Tong left Guangzhou in 1951 at age 11 . <p> In 1957 , the Catholic Church in China split over whether the Vatican or the Communist Party had the right to appoint bishops . During the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76 , even so-called patriotic clergymen fell victim to the campaign against the " four olds , " which included such old beliefs as religion . <p> After Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978 , China was more lenient toward religious practices . Priests were released from jail , and churches reopened . Millions of Bibles are printed legally and sold in China . Nonetheless , the " patriotic " church movement has remained intact , and seminarians are supposed to sign statements recognizing the Communist Party 's authority . Although China recently proclaimed that there is no one imprisoned for religious beliefs , Bishop Tong estimates about 60 Catholics are in jail or under house arrest in China . <p> Tong described Beijing 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said , " This is their dilemma : They want to be tolerant , but they also want to use religious activities to serve their purposes under their guidance . " <p> A vast gray area has opened up . Many underground church members take refuge in the official churches to worship . There are 70 bishops in the official church , but half have been secretly recognized by the Vatican . There are 60 bishops in the so-called underground church , but many of them are known to the government , and some serve as priests in the official church . <p> Some Protestant groups here could face even more pressure than the Roman Catholic church . Many of them lack the Vatican 's clout or are linked to charismatic groups in China that are feared by authorities . <p> This week , Chinese authorities confirmed they had detained Peter Xu Yongze , head of the New Birth church , who is estimated to have a following in the millions . The New China News Agency called it a " criminal prosecution , " adding that the cleric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese government . " This sort of justification makes Christians in Hong Kong nervous . <p> " Colonialism is not a monopoly of white Western powers ; colonialism can be found among people of different colors , " said Deng Zhaoming , a Lutheran who edits Bridge , a small religious bimonthly . Like many in Hong Kong , his family was split by the Communists ' 1949 victory . Two siblings stayed in Guangzhou and did not see him for more than 20 years . <p> Deng said the New China News Agency called him in for a conference three years ago to discuss his criticism of China 's policies on religious freedom . An agency official described that accusation today as " rubbish , " adding : " I do n't think the news agency ever discouraged him or any other person from expressing his own views . " <p> Later , Deng lost a job at a seminary , where he taught the history of the church after 1949 . Overseas funding for Bridge has dried up , and the magazine will close at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of isolation drawn closer and closer to you , " Deng said .
