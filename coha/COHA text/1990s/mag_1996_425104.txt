The display case slid out easily from the tall metal cabinet in the American Museum 's Department of Entomology , and there they were  --  two small butterflies with shiny , azure wings . My father had caught them on the island of Jamaica in 1933 . Ten years later , two of the department 's taxonomists , William P. Comstock and E. Irving Huntington , described a new subspecies based on these butterflies and named it Thecla celida shoumatoffi , or Shoumatoff 's hairstreak , after my father . Only fifteen years old when he netted the specimens , my father was spending a month on the island , collecting butterflies and moths with his uncle Andrey Avinoff . The director of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History , a trustee of the American Museum , and an avid lepidopterist , Avinoff was once a gentleman-in-waiting to Czar Nicholas . Before the revolution , he had amassed an enormous collection of mainly Russian and Central Asian butterflies  --  some eighty thousand specimens . The collection was impounded by the Bolsheviks and is now at the Zoological Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jamaica had been " a dreamland of tropical splendor " since his boyhood , when he vainly scrutinized magazine illustrations of the island with a magnifying glass , looking for butterflies . Later , as an exile in the New World , he made six trips to Jamaica between 1926 and 1940 , five of them with my father . The two caught more than fourteen thousand " bots , " as butterflies and moths are known in Jamaican patois , doubling the number of known species on the island to more than a thousand . By day , they dashed around with their tulle nets , pith helmets wrapped in white pongee , pockets bulging with cyanide jars , and canvas leggings to keep off chiggers and ticks . On overnights in the bush , they slept on cots under canopies of mosquito netting . Once a week , they would put in at one of the better hotels . One evening , with a deft presto , my dad snagged a noctuid moth that had been dive-bombing a bullet-headed Britisher , and everyone in the dining room applauded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching a butterfly in midair , as opposed to an adagio , which to him meant sneaking up on resting quarry . ) Avinoff 's fascination with butterflies was not just scientific ; he also made exquisite , minute , true-to-life watercolors of them . Our house in Bedford , an hour north of New York City , was filled with his flower and butterfly paintings , and as a boy in the fifties , I carried on the family tradition by catching , mounting , and painting local butterflies . My father , an engineer , was president of the New York Entomological Society , which met at the American Museum . I remember being taken there , gaping at outrageously gaudy tropical butterflies , and meeting Cyril F. dos Passos , a research associate and a cousin of the novelist John Dos Passos . He was an authority on the rules of zoological nomenclature and wrote many papers on the subject . Cyril dos Passos died three months short of his hundredth birthday in 1986 . Vladimir Nabokov , another Russian emigre butterfly lover , was a frequent visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He specialized in the blues , cousins of the hairstreaks , and would come in to study the specimens . ( I have his 1949 monograph on the neotropical blues , inscribed to Avinoff in Cyrillic . ) A Haitian skipper was named for him . One of his poems , " On Discovering a Butterfly , " reads in part : I found it and I named it , being versed in taxonomic Latin ; thus became godfather to an insect and its first describer  --  and I want no other fame . Wide open on its pin ( though fast asleep ) , and safe from creeping relatives and rust , in the secluded stronghold where we keep type specimens it will transcend its dust . Dark pictures , thrones , the stones that pilgrims kiss , poems that take a thousand years to die but ape the immortality of this red label on a little butterfly . Bernard Heineman succeeded my father as president of the Entomological Society . In 1972 , he coauthored a sumptuous , color-plated book , Jamaica and Its Butterflies , in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Norman D. Riley , in his Field Guide to the Butteyflies of the West Indies , described the butterfly as " rare and local , chiefly met with in open upland country . " According to Kurt Johnson , a systematist who is a research associate in the Museum 's Department of Entomology , Shoumatoff 's hairstreak is extremely sedentary : " If it 's anything like the other celidas , it rarely strays more than a few meters from its food plant , but nothing is known of its specific natural history . Some of these hairstreaks are so secretive , they are only known from dead specimens collected from spider webs . " In 1971 , when I was twenty-four , I spent a month exploring Jamaica . I kept an eye out for Shoumatoff 's hairstreaks , but the only ones I saw were on pins in display cases at the Jamaica Institute in Kingston . In the years that followed , I made dozens of trips to the tropics . Sometimes I would stop by the American Museum with butterflies I had caught . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were on the way home from Madagascar , and we showed Fred Rindge , the curator of Lepidoptera , a swallowtail with luminous green wing bars we had netted in a gully . It turned out to be a Papilio mangoura , a specimen now being made scarce by habitat destruction . Rindge retired in 1990 , but he still comes in four days a week from his home in New Jersey . When I dropped in one recent morning , he was dissecting ( under a microscope ) the genitalia of geometrid moths , " the group I have specialized in for lo these decades , " he explained . The geometrids , best known in their larval stage  --  inchworms  --  are one of the " big three " families of moths , with an estimated twenty thousand species . There are about ten times more moths than there are butterflies ( the true butterflies , or Papilionoidea , number about 14,500 species worldwide ) , and the moths account for most of the Museum 's roughly two million specimens of Lepidoptera . The collection is surpassed only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is on a par with those of the Carnegie Museum and the Smithsonian Institution . The department was thriving , Rindge told me . It has seven curators now , more than ever before , and has become a leading force in research . I also met Jim Miller , the current curator of Lepidoptera . " My guys , " as he called the group he specializes in , " are day-flying noctuoids known as Josia , which are in a mimicry complex with metalmark butterflies and tiger moths . You can find them all on the same trail 6,000 feet up in the Ecuadorean Andes . " The Noctuoidea , which comprise 70,000 species , are the largest of the forty superfamilies of Lepidoptera . Like Fred Rindge , Miller was hired for his moth expertise . " Moth systematics border on the intractable , " he told me . " The same moth that has one name in our collection can have another in some other museum 's . " Shoumatoff 's hairstreak , I discovered , had been upgraded to a species since my last visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose only difference from Thecla celida celida , a Cuban subspecies , appeared to be a small , wholly black tailspot on the underside of its hindwing , as opposed to the black-centered orange-and-yellow tailspot on 7 : c. celida . But Thecla was a catchall genus and was eventually broken up into more than a hundred genera . In 1964 , the subspecies shoumatoffi was placed in a new genus , Nesiostrymon . Then in 1991 , Kurt Johnson decided it was really a species of its own and reclassified it as Nesiostrymon shoumatoffi . By this time , many hairstreaks had been discovered to mate by scent . Minor differences in wing theme , like the color of a tailspot , were now seen as the random results of taxonomically unimportant genetic drift . Examination of its genitalia revealed shoumatoffi to be in fact much closer to a mainland species , Nesiostrymon celona , which ranges from Mexico to Argentina but is not easily seen because it , too , is very local and elusive . Previously , the butterflies of the Antilles were thought to have been dispersed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of them , including perhaps shoumatoffi , are believed by biogeographers to have evolved from the original stock after the islands broke off from the Mesoamerican mainland , about sixty million years ago . I called Tom Turner , an authority on the butterflies of the Antilles , who works in Clearwater , Florida . He told me that shoumatoffi is the third rarest hairstreak on Jamaica ; the other two are only known from a single specimen . " The last time I , or to my knowledge anybody , caught one was in 1975 , and I 've been looking for it all the time . It lives in the wettest forest , which gets two hundred inches of rain a year . My father , however , recalls that he caught it in many different habitats on the island . Its food plant is not known . With its bright white underside , it appears to flicker on and off as it skips through the bush , so you can see it from a long way off . It looks like confetti blowing in the wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean . " Later on in that day that I spent in the Museum 's section on epidoptera , one of Jim Miller 's proteges , Cal Snyder , showed me a tray of Papilio homerus . The largest swallowtail in the New World , five inches from wingtip to wingtip , with yellow bands and spatulate tail , it is found only on Jamaica and is a famous rarity . ( It is known in the patois as Goula , my father 's boyhood name , which means " little dove " in Russian . Avinoff had shouted " Goula , Goula , " when he spotted one in Jamaica 's eastern Blue Mountains . Their guides thought he was referring to the bot . ) Snyder spends half the year in the field , collecting in the neotropics . " Time is running out , " he told me . " Taxa are vanishing before our eyes . Many of the type localities of the thirties no longer exist . " For the moment , homerus , whose range is restricted to the steepest , most pristine slopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Snyder was worried about it . " In twenty years , " he predicted grimly , " these museum specimens could be the last homerus . " The same could soon be true of Shoumatoff 's hairstreaks . <p>
