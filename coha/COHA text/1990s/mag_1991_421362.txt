Section : Outfront Conversations at the January 26 , 1991 , Peace Rally and March in Washington , D.C. <p> Bill Van Felix , veteran of the battles against Spanish fascism with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the 1930s . <p> " Nothing over there is worth the life of one American and one Arab . The supposed enemy and our allies there are autocracies , nondemocratic governments . Not a social structure I would support . Kuwait is not a democracy . This is a struggle for the spoils of the oil industry . The U.S. is no master at teaching democracy . We always back the wrong horse for the wrong reason . <p> " I 'm not opposed to fighting . You must struggle to maintain things that are good . I have nothing against guaranteeing the security of Israel . But she has no God-given right to ignore the rights of non-Israelis . <p> " It looks as difficult as hell to extricate ourselves from this . It was easier to stay out than to get out . Somehow we should get our troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria Johnson , of Massachusetts , has a son in the air force . <p> " My youngest son , Gregory , is over there . While I support him , I do n't think we should be involved in this war . He called about two weeks ago . He said that the situation over there was bad . I feel that we are in total chaos because at home we have problems with our cities being controlled by drug lords and the country is being run by someone who is being a warlord . He did n't give enough time to negotiate peace . So I feel that our leaders are not peacemakers but war makers - which is why our young people are over there . Our next generation is there . And unless we do something , they are going to die ; they 're going to perish . And it will be our loss . <p> " My son 's four year would have been up next month . With the war , he lost that and he 's been given another year . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Taps " on a borrowed bugle . <p> " A week before the war deadline , someone put up a tent in the main meadow in the middle of the university . Since then , other tents have gone up so that now there are over thirty tents . People are staying out there , protesting the war . It 's extremely cold . In the large tent , they 've set up a stove . We got a real negative response one night . After a basketball game , a victory celebration turned into a pro-American , pro-war rally . They came out at one o'clock in the morning and really got nasty with us . They set one of our tents on fire . They burned a peace flag . They set fireworks , bottle rockets off into our crowd . <p> " People have a blind patriotism that says , If your president tells you to go to war , you go to war . ' We 're a truer form of democracy because we re willing to stand up and say , Listen , if our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him . ' We 're willing to stand up and say when he 's wrong . " <p> Jim Matlack , director of the Washington , D. C. , office of the American Friends Service Committee . <p> " For months , we 've been swamped with people asking about conscientious-objector status ; if they 're in the service , how to get out ; if they 're afraid of a draft , how do they begin to think about what they , individually , will do . Lots of calls . <p> " We 're taking contributions in cooperation with the Red Cross , the UN agencies working in the refugee camps in Jordan . And there will be camps in Turkey and Syria if people are able to get out . If it 's a long war , the estimates go from 800,000 to one million refugees . And they need everything in the camps . <p> " For our staff and for Quaker circles generally , there 's a kind of sadness . That the war has come is not a great surprise . United States policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't strong enough to be patient and do it by other means . Eisenhower spoke about being strong enough to be patient . Bush put himself and U.S. policy in a place where the answer seemed to be war . But he set most of those momentums in place . He did n't have the courage or the resilience to say that for once we can do it by nonviolent means . Instead , he decided to go to war to try to solve it . The end result will be the defeat of Iraq . But there 'll be problems of many kinds , and human suffering and calamity to be dealt with throughout the region . " <p> Tom Quirk , Boston , carried a sign festooned with yellow ribbons . <p> " I was very ambiguous about whether I should come or not . The yellow ribbons represent the fact that I support the troops but not the president 's policy , and not the policies of the last ten years that got us there . Although I 'm not convinced that if we stopped fighting now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's my dilemma . Will we have made Hussein what he claimed to be before all this started ? He could claim that he backed us down . And he 'll be the new hero for every Islamic fundamentalist in the Middle East . If you kill him , who 'll take over ? Do we have an occupying force for twenty years ? I do n't know ! I do n't think that we thought down the road . And now we 're stuck here . " <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> Art and interviews by Steve Brodner <p> THE PRICE TAG <p> Remember when we could n't afford a Peace Dividend ? Now we 're spending ... <p> $3 million to reactivate 150 military reservists . That would feed and shelter all of America 's 100,000 homeless children for two nights . <p> $3 billion to reactivate all 150,000 military reservists . That would quadruple the federal AIDS budget . <p> $176 million to fuel Operation Desert Storm aircraft for eight days .

That would provide health education and medical services for 4 million women a year through Planned Parenthood . <p> $64 million to replace two F-118 fighter jets . That would feed 22 million people for one year through CARE 's famine-relief programs . ( The UN says 27 million people in Africa may die of hunger this year . ) <p> $45 million to replace one F-14 Tomcat fighter plane .
