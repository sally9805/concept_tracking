<p> It 's well past midnight , and Steve Hoggart is skating to the sounds of Bob Marley around the empty streets of Alexandria . Denise Murray is shuffling between the grocery store and the launderette in downtown Washington . And Tony and Emily Addinall push carts overflowing with toys around the Woodbridge Wal-Mart , trying to finish their Christmas shopping and get some sleep before they have to get up and go to work in a few hours . <p> Those are typical scenes each night across the Washington area , where busy city dwellers and suburbanites alike try to squeeze 28-hour lives into 24-hour days . Increasingly , they manage by taking care of tasks previously thought of as daytime activities , such as grocery shopping and sending mail , and by exercising between midnight and dawn . <p> " What keeps me up this late ? " asked John Tsiaoushis one recent morning at 3:55 , as he filled out and copied tax forms in an Alexandria Kinko 's 24-hour copy shop . " This is the only free time I have . Either I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " <p> In the holiday season , when time is in even shorter supply , things get especially crazy and gift buying often is done well after David Letterman 's TV show has wrapped up for the night . <p> Hence the recent decision by Wal-Mart to keep four of its Virginia stores open all night . <p> Northern Virginia district manager Jeff Eversole said the plan originally was to be open 24 hours only for the Christmas season . But because of the flood of customers as late as 2 a.m. , he said , the all-night hours will be permanent at the Woodbridge and Manassas stores . <p> " At 1 or 2 a.m. , it 's like being at the store at 8 or 9 p.m. , " Eversole said of the 24-hour stores he supervises . <p> That 's a sentiment Woodbridge store manager Paul Antoniadis shares . <p> " At 12 a.m. , I have nine registers going , " said Antoniadis , whose store is 30 miles south of Washington in Prince William County , where residents have one of the longest commutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-distance commuters get home , have dinner and tuck in their children , it 's late at night  --  the only time some have to do their errands . <p> Long commutes are not the only reason more people are forced to take care of personal business after midnight , according to Harvard economist Juliet Schor . Americans simply are working longer hours than they were 20 years ago , she said . <p> " I found that the typical American worker between 1969 and 1989 added an extra month of work a year to their schedules , " said Schor , author of " The Overworked American . " <p> " We have record rates of moonlighting , " especially among lower-wage earners , who have to work longer hours to make ends meet , she said . <p> At 1 a.m. , Tony and Emily Addinall , still dressed from the office , are trying to navigate their shopping carts full of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers comforters and Barbie 's Starlight Motorhome toward the registers at the Woodbridge Wal-Mart . <p> Inside the store at midnight , it feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lines are four deep at the registers , as Christmas music blares overhead . <p> Emily Addinall , 33 , works as a financial aid counselor in Alexandria and Tony Addinall , 34 , as a computer network manager based in Reston . They had commuted back to their Lorton home and had dinner with their 4- and 7-year-old children before heading first to Christmas choir practice at their church and then to shop . <p> After midnight was the only time the two could buy stocking stuffers and Christmas toys for their children . In five hours , both would be getting up to start a new day . <p> " You either do the shopping now or on the weekend , " Tony Addinall said . <p> Suburbanites are not the only ones pushed for time . At 11:30 one recent night , D.C. resident Denise Murray was at the National Capital Post Office near Union Station , which is open until midnight . Murray , 40 , who works for the U.S. Agency for International Development , said that when she 's at work all day , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time she gets home , she needs to eat and rest before she can face her errands . <p> She regularly goes to the post office after 11 p.m. and stays up until 2 a.m. to do her grocery shopping and laundry at all-night locations in her Shaw neighborhood <p> " I 'm lucky I only require four hours of sleep , " said Murray , who still had her plastic photo ID tag from work dangling around her neck . " If I had to sleep more , I 'd be in trouble . " <p> But according to James B. Maas , a sleep specialist at Cornell University , Murray and the Addinalls may be shortchanging themselves . They and many other Americans are not getting the 8.4 hours of sleep a night they need on average , he said . <p> " You have to have leisure time ... time to do the shopping , time with the kids , " Maas said . " So where do we cheat ? We cheat on our sleep . If we ran machinery to the extent we 're running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , we 'd be accused of reckless operation endangerment . " <p> At 3:55 a.m. , Tsiaoushis , 27 , was trying his best to stay awake . <p> He sat hunched over a desk in a corner of an Old Town Alexandria Kinko 's . In front of him was a stack of old tax returns . He punched numbers into a calculator and scribbled figures on tax forms , hoping to finish and copy the papers before sunrise . <p> Tsiaoushis had been up for 21 hours , and the deep circles around his eyes and the dark stubble creeping across his face proved it . His day started at 7 a.m. , when he drove from his home in Alexandria to Baltimore , where he worked until 3 p.m. selling cars . He rushed back and worked at his family 's Alexandria restaurant . After midnight was the only time he could take care of the paperwork he needed by dawn . <p> Rockville resident Kristen Bender , 29 , a Montgomery County prosecutor , said the hours between midnight and 2 a.m. often are the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties she gives . <p> " I let all the things in my day , the criminals , the witnesses , melt away as I make the soup , " said Bender , an active volunteer . " It 's the only time I have quiet time . " <p> Bender said she and her boyfriend , Denis Fournier , 35 , frequently attend church services that start at 11:15 p.m. at a Georgetown University chapel . Fournier , a flight attendant with United Airlines who lives in Bethesda , said he often returns to Dulles International Airport too late to catch daytime church services . So , on Sundays he attends the service that ends after midnight . <p> The Rev. Thomas King said that since 1969 , he has offered late-night services . The services now are held six nights a week , including Sundays , when it 's standing room only as 200 worshipers pack into the chapel . <p> Others find the only time to exercise is late at night . That 's when Steve Hoggart goes skating . <p> Hoggart , a 34-year-old Alexandria freelance film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 p.m . After eating , he frequently slips on his black in-line skates , puts a tape into his Walkman and hits the streets of Old Town for an hour or two . <p> " It 's like a different world at night , " said Hoggart , who sometimes skates until 2 a.m. , covering eight to 12 miles an evening . He does n't mind the hour . " You do n't see any other Roller-bladers , bikers , cars or tourists . It 's like a ghost town . If you have the stars , the moon and the right music , it 's very pleasant . " <p> The wee hours are not so magical for Ed Ceol , 32 , of Centreville , who works as a waiter and goes to school at George Mason University . With a day that stretches from 8:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. , Ceol does chores such as changing the oil in his car , hanging curtains and cooking from 1 to 4 a.m . <p> Ceol acknowledged that he is losing more than just sleep ; he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a communications director for a health care association , gets up earlier in the morning than he does , they often do n't talk to each other face to face for days on end . Almost all of their communication is done by telephone or on a kitchen message board . <p> " I get down , I get lonely , but you learn to cope , " said his wife , Dawn Weyrich Ceol , 30 , who sometimes pays her bills at 4:30 a.m . <p> " There is never time in my life when I can sit down with a book and curl up , " she said . " That has n't happened in 10 years .
