It 's Sunday night . Time to make the weekly how're-you-doing phone call to your mother living alone back in Omaha . But when she finally answers , something is wrong . Her speech is labored and slurred , and she is talking about things that make no sense . You , friend , wo n't be at the office tomorrow ; you 'll be on the first plane to Omaha . Your mother  --  the exuberant bon vivant who was going to outlive you all  --  has suddenly gotten old . And you have just landed a second career : caregiver to an elderly parent . What will it be like ? Do n't even try to predict . A thousand variables will determine what burdens elder care has in store for you , including the illnesses that befall your parents , how far away they live , and how much money you and they have . Nothing can make the decline of a proud patriarch or a once lively mother the least bit pleasant . But ignoring the inevitable and refusing to think about it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and your parents will face . If you can pull your family together , talk frankly about options before a crisis develops , and get in touch early with the network of service and information providers designed to assist the elderly , you can make your job easier . A few common misunderstandings about elder care are best dispelled early . First , it is not child care  --  treating an ailing adult like a child is demeaning and unnecessary . Second , do not assume that moving your parents permanently into your home is the best solution ; they may not want to live with you , either . Third , you probably do n't need to put them in a nursing home , but if you do , you may be stunned to discover that Medicare , which spares no expense to cure every medical problem , will not pay for extended nursing home care . Chances are , your parents wo n't need much outside help before they are in their late 70s or early 80s . But the odds that you will wind up taking care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65-year-old male can expect to live to be 80 , a female to 84 . The fastest-growing segment of the population is the over-85 crowd . Relatively few of them  --  only about one in four  --  can live alone without difficulty , says Eileen Crimmins , a demographer at the University of Southern California . According to a Conference Board study , about 25% of the working-age population describe themselves as responsible for the care of an elder . They spend an average of ten hours a week at the task . Unlike child care , elder care is n't necessarily " women 's work . " One employee counseling service reports that males make only 10% of the calls concerning child care problems , but 40% of the calls about problems with elderly parents . Executives are as likely as blue-collar workers to wind up responsible for the care of aging parents . When Eric Mayer 's mother had a stroke that left her partially paralyzed , Mayer , managing director of a Beverly Hills firm that oversees a $6.5 billion real estate portfolio , spent most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes your life , " says Mayer . " Taking care of someone is not the kind of thing you delegate to your staff . " About half the time , an elderly person becomes incapacitated suddenly , going from independent to infirm because of an event such as a stroke or a broken hip , says Michael Creedon , a gerontologist in Vienna , Virginia . Even when parents decline slowly , their transition from frail-but-independent to needing help often comes as a jolt : A cop lifts Dad 's driver 's license after some confusion on the highway ; now he ca n't shop for food anymore . Mom 's arthritis becomes so uncomfortable she can no longer button her blouse . They get depressed or confused and fail to pay utility bills , and a neighbor calls you to say their lights have been off all week . Raising the subject of old age with your parents is often exquisitely difficult . But J.B. Hancock , head of a video production compay in Arlington , Virginia , discovered a good opening line : " I just went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told her elderly parents , who live in Florida . " It made me wonder if you folks need any help with your plans or want to talk things over . " The hope is that your parents will be relieved if you bring up the subject  --  it indicates you do n't plan to abandon them when they get old . If they balk at the topic , back off and try again in a few months . The consequences of not planning can be severe . When a crisis hits , you wo n't have the information you need or the authority to act on your parent 's behalf . As a result , you could spend weeks or months lining up the services you need . It is best to involve your whole family in any discussion of care  --  not just your brothers and sisters , but their spouses as well . And do n't load everything onto the eldest daughter who happens to live nearby . Michael Creedon tells of one woman who announced her plans to retire , only to discover that her brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life taking care of their parents . Says Creedon : " She went right on working . " If you have a family that can not discuss the weather without fighting , bring in a minister or other trusty outsider to act as referee . A family meeting is a good time to learn some important basics , such as your parents ' Social Security and Medicare identification numbers , their doctors ' names , and as much of their medical history as they think you need to make intelligent decisions with them . Ask if you might meet their neighbors and exchange phone numbers for use in emergencies . Inquire , very gently , about their income , insurance , and other financial resources . Under which rhododendron have they buried their safe deposit box keys , wills , and other papers ? Parents should give power of attorney to someone to make legal , financial , and medical decisions if they are incapacitated and can not decide for themselves ; a will , which disperses assets after death , does not accomplish that . Afraid your parents will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge ? Point out that most states forbid self-serving asset transfers by caretakers . Also find out what kind of medical heroics they want and encourage them to fill out a living will . Now to the big question : Where should they live ? While they are healthy and can afford it , staying in their own home is usually best . Anne Brophy Putney , community affairs director for WOGL , a CBS-owned radio station in Philadelphia , realized during a visit earlier this year that her 87-year-old mother in Palo Alto , California , was growing more fragile . Through a company-sponsored elder care program , she learned of a Palo Alto firm , Older Adults Care Management , that could evaluate her mother 's needs and provide help . " We decided not to move her now , " says Putney . " She 's lived in her home for 40 years . The camellias are blooming , the freesias are out , and the fruit trees are laden with oranges . And she 's the neighborhood candy lady who 's been giving treats to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd be happiest at home . " The firm helped Putney find two women who take turns as her mother 's live-in caregivers . If either parent is likely to want or need an alternative form of housing , start planning early . Attractive places are hard to find , and waiting lists may be long . In Memphis , where the Methodist Church sponsors several well-run , federally subsidized apartment buildings for seniors , Jerry Corlew , one of the directors , says there is a waiting list of 1,400 for the 400 apartments . Depending on the location , the wait ranges from three months to three years . The lesson : Get on several lists early . Parents should also know that if they wait until they are sick to move to new housing , they will limit their options significantly . King 's Row , an apartment complex that provides meals , housekeeping , and social activities for the elderly in Middletown , New Jersey , requires residents to be  --  and to remain  --  " continent , mobile , and oriented to time and space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers $90 mortgage payments will be stunned at the cost too . King 's Row , though neat and pleasant , is n't much fancier than a good motel , but studio apartments cost $1,864 a month . " You ca n't live here on Social Security alone , " Coffino warns . Elders whose medical or family history makes them worry about a stroke , Alzheimer 's , or any long period of incapacity might want to look at a so-called continuing-care facility . This is one of the fastest-growing new forms of senior housing . It combines apartments for those able to live independently , an " assisted care " section for people who have trouble dressing or using the bathroom , and a nursing home for those needing full-time care . Continuing-care facilities vary in important ways . Some , like Applewood Estates in Freehold , New Jersey , require a big entry fee up front  --  between $90,000 and $140,000 , depending on the size and type of apartment . Monthly rent and fees for a couple come to another $1,700 . However , the rent does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nursing home . The facilities appear similar at Bedford Court , a continuing-care facility run by Marriott in Silver Spring , Maryland . But the finances are much different . Bedford 's up-front fee of $7,000 is refundable , with interest , if a tenant leaves ; the nursing home , on the other hand , costs $40,000 a year . Last year Jack Whitwell , a retired Princeton professor , and his wife , Blanche , moved to Applewood . She had fully recovered from a serious illness , but both feared a recurrence might mean moving her to a nursing home . " We were paying a lot for our house and for nursing home insurance , and determined that a continuing-care facility would cost about the same , " says Whitwell . Your parents must be in good health to enter a continuing-care home . Applewood asks to see their medical records and reviews their finances to make sure they can afford the place , says marketing director Jack Titus . Study the track record of the operator of any home you 're considering , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts . Some homes have gone bankrupt , often meaning that residents lost their up-front fee . Should you plan to move your parents into your own home ? Most expert opinion counsels against it . They get cut off from their friends , lose autonomy , and often bicker with their children . " There is no kitchen big enough for two women , " argues Rose Dobrof , head of the Brookdale Center on Aging at Hunter College in New York City . Dobrof says her father-in-law made her promise , on her wedding day , that she would never put him in a nursing home . When he could no longer live independently , she felt obliged to move him into her house . He missed his home and friends of 50 years , and his last years were difficult for everyone . " I should never have been pressured to make that promise , " she says . Parents sometimes wo n't admit they can no longer manage by themselves . A mother may hide from the children that her husband has Alzheimer 's , or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result : When the kids go home to visit , they are often aghast at the problems they discover . Agencies that work with caregivers report a spike in the number of desperate phone calls right after Christmas , when all those offspring returning to the family homestead have discovered their parents ' lives in disarray . Suddenly or gradually , ready or probably not , you understand just how hard a time your parents are having as they try to cope unassisted . Diane Piktialis , who heads the elder care referral program for Work/Family Directions , a Boston firm that advises employees at dozens of large corporations , identifies the following signs of trouble : forgetfulness , mood swings , weight loss , lack of grooming , and unpaid bills . Your job is to help your parents keep safe and independent for as long as possible . A surprising number of services are designed to assist you . If an accident or illness already has your parent in the hospital , contact the social services director there . Virtually every hospital has one , though your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social services person will evaluate a patient 's needs for assistance after discharge and arrange his care  --  even place him in a nursing home . The hospital should not pressure you into taking home a relative you ca n't handle . If , after discharge , your parent still needs help from medical professionals , doctors can prescribe an array of services . Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles , for example , has a small mock village , complete with shops , curbs , kitchens , and teller machines , to help stroke and accident victims regain skills . Occupational therapists can teach an impaired person how to brush his teeth again or cook , and devise solutions to other problems by using such props as oversize buttons and grab bars for bathtubs . Medicare will sometimes pay for such services but usually only for a few weeks . If your parents ' problems develop more gradually , there are other avenues of assistance . Large corporations often have elder care resources for employees that include literature , videotapes , and seminars on topics ranging from guilt to finances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . The department responsible is often listed under the Area Agency on Aging . Do n't worry , it 's not welfare ; many elder care services are available regardless of how affluent the recipient is . One man in Santa Monica , California , uses the town 's elder care ambulance to get his mother to the doctor because her stretcher wo n't fit in his limousine . In most cases the town or county contracts with local nonprofit groups to provide care . A confederation of 350 churches handles virtually all the organized elder care in Memphis . Sister Mary Simon , a Catholic nun , runs the Monmouth County , New Jersey , office on aging . " Call us early , " she suggests . " Ninety percent of the time , people wait until they are exhausted from elder care before they seek help . Often it 's the people who tried to do too much and get to the end of their rope who wind up abusing their parents . " Nearly all area agencies will send a trained social worker to evaluate your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies provide transportation for shopping and medical visits , day care centers where otherwise isolated seniors can socialize with peers , and daily home delivery of a hot meal . The last is particularly useful , because the volunteers are trained to look for signs of trouble and report back if the person fails to answer the door . For frail elderly who can not afford to pay , some agencies will provide homemakers to help with grooming and housekeeping a few hours a week . Waiting lists for free services are often long , but sometimes just a little money will go a long way : Memphis oldsters who pay $3.75 a day can be put on the " upscale " Meals on Wheels route without delay . For families who can afford it , one of the most useful new services for elder care is the private geriatric care manager . These are typically social workers and nurses who arrange and supervise most of the help an elderly person needs . They are particularly useful if parents live far away from children , or if relations between the generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hires , inspects , and fires in-home care aides for clients ; pays bills ; arranges placement in nursing homes ; and even made daily visits to a dying woman whose kids could n't get to her bedside . Robert Giese , chief executive of a computer sales and service company in Rochester , New York , hired geriatric care manager Marianne Ewig three years ago after his mother in Milwaukee was found unconscious in a diabetic coma . When she recovered , Ewig noticed a hearing problem and had it diagnosed and treated . Giese says Ewig then realized that his mother was depressed . She arranged for Louise Giese to see a psychiatrist and set up visits between her and other lonely seniors . Once the depression was controlled , Mrs. Giese was emotionally prepared to move to an apartment complex for the elderly that Ewig found . Private care managers are n't cheap . Ewig charges $65 an hour . Mary-Ellen Siegel , a private geriatric social worker , says the going rate in New York City is $75 to $100 an hour ; the bill for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parent and children could be $250 . How do you find the right person ? The National Association of Private Geriatric Care Managers in Tucson , Arizona , offers lists of experienced professionals by region . Local organizations that work with the elderly can also make suggestions . Keep in mind that states do n't license elder care managers . Are you a failure as a son or daughter if you have to send Mom to a nursing home ? No . For many older people , especially those requiring 24-hour care , a home eventually becomes the best choice . Alzheimer 's victims may start wandering the streets at night or leave the stove burning for hours . In other cases a caregiver may be unable to lift the still-at-home parent out of bed . If your parents pressure you to promise never to send them to a nursing home , do n't humor them or lie . Assure them that they will be involved in the decision , that it will happen only if it is absolutely necessary , and that it wo n't be a surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk will have a big smile , but the care your mother really gets comes down to the low-wage aide , often an immigrant , who hoists her out of bed and changes her diaper . Inquire about staff turnover , training and wages , the ratio of nurses to patients , and the visiting hours , which should be almost unlimited . Many states perform regular inspections of nursing homes ; you can get copies of the evaluations from local agencies for the aging . There are several kinds of nursing home care , and the differences are important . Medicare , " Medigap , " and most private health insurance policies pay a limited amount for " skilled nursing home care , " which requires the services of doctors , nurses , and rehabilitation experts . They do not cover nursing home costs if the patient there can get by with relatively unskilled custodial care . The probability that a woman will enter a nursing home at some point in her life is 1 in 2 ; for men it is 1 in 3 . Many patients stay only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of a long stay  --  one year or more  --  is 1 in 7 for men and 1 in 3 for women . The homes cost a bundle  --  an average of $30,000 a year in 1990 , and as much as $50,000 in large cities . Since the median household net worth for people over 65 is $73,500 , and the average annual income for senior males is $14,000 , according to the American Association of Retired Persons , a long stay will bankrupt many families . Daniel Fish , a New York attorney specializing in law for the elderly , sees the problem up close . " The phone call I get a lot is from the spouse or children of an elderly person about to be released from the hospital . They 've just been told he has to go to a nursing home and that Medicare wo n't pay . They are hysterical and desperate . " What happens ? When the family gets poor enough , a welfare program , Medicaid , will pick up the cost . Rules vary by state , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets to qualify for Medicaid . Depending on the state , a spouse can retain between $13,700 and $68,700 in assets  --  hardly enough to live off the income . There is an escape : A person anticipating a long nursing home stay can transfer all his assets to his children or to an irrevocable trust , and thus qualify for Medicaid . The hitch is that the transfer must usually be made 2-1/2 years before Medicaid begins . It is perfectly legal , says Fish , who arranges many asset transfers . Proponents of transfers view them as ethically akin to shrewd tax-avoidance maneuvers . Opponents say transfers , especially when orchestrated by greedy relatives who do n't want to " waste " their inheritance on Dad 's nursing home care , take money away from the truly needy . Once the money has been given away , the parents can not get it back even if the children are spending it on themselves . Also , good nursing homes usually charge more than Medicaid pays . A person relying solely on Medicaid may have to settle for a shabbier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who came in paying the full private rate remain once they must use Medicaid . For families who have made some advance preparations , elder care should not be a crushing burden . It may be a disruptive surprise , but professionals in the field have observed that most children  --  even harried baby-boomers struggling with young children and midlife crises  --  assume their responsibilities willingly and without resentment . The caregivers who suffer most are those who try to do too much alone . They should realize they will do themselves and their parents a greater service by seeking help . When your turn comes , be conscientious . Remember , your own children will be watching . And someday you may be on the receiving end of elder care . <p>
