It had been a pleasant afternoon of purging some preseason misses out of dove guns by shooting at Sporting Clays , and had the battues been buffaloes our squad would have been trampled . So at sunset we hoisted tailgate toasts to the wonderful differences between birds and clays ( never toasted a damned battue ) , and wound up getting a bit maudlin about all the things that hunting season means and how none of us could conceive of fall without it . " I 'm hunting every day I can this year , " one guy was saying . " Way things are looking , another bad duck hatch or two could shut down the season . I want to get some pictures of my dog and my kid and the old blind to at least remember the way it was . " " Duck huntin ' , hell , " rumbled a voice from the adjoining truck . " With the eco-nuts taking over in Washington and all this bull on television about the health hazards of lead , we may not be shooting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will be with that damned steel shot . " " Not me , " said the first guy . " I 'll sell my guns first , and take up golf . " I asked if quitting would n't be exactly what the anti-hunters wanted us to do . " Is n't it just a matter of time , anyway ? " he asked sadly . " They 've already closed down some shooting ranges for firing lead over water , and lead fishing sinkers will be banned next year . They 've made the first step toward banning lead shot by making hunters use steel on doves and quail on some federal refuges . And now they 're coming out with one new cockamamie regulation after another . " They want to ban size F steel for waterfowl next season , restrict the length of shotgun chambers to 3-1/2 inches , and require approval for the coatings put on pellets to keep them from rusting . There 's even a regulation to keep shooting preserves or individuals from raising and releasing mallard ducks for fear they might contaminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're trying to nit-pick and hassle hunters right out of the game . " The lawyer in the bunch , who I 'll refer to as " Legal Eagle , " since that is n't his nickname , has had considerable experience in environmental law , and was shaking his head in disagreement . " What you guys are doing is putting two and two together and coming up with seven , " he said , " building scarecrows and then scaring yourselves with them . If you want to just give up  --  which I do n't believe for a second  --  that 's fine . But you really need to know what you 're talking about before you start spooking others out of shooting . " Drowned out by groans , Legal Eagle held up his hand for order and made his arguments to the tailgate jury : " This stuff about new regulations for F shot and pellet coatings and such looks , to me , like minor stuff that the Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) probably did n't want to bring up under the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beans . " Have n't I heard some of you same guys griping that Fs are too much like buckshot and cause too much sky-blasting and out-of-range crippling ? A number of states outlawed them long ago . You wo n't use Fs anyway because you know you can get more geese with the denser patterns of Ts and Triple Bs . So where 's the big deal ? " What 's really happening in Washington is that we 've suddenly got environmentalists running things , and some bureaucrats are going to be dragging out anything they think might earn ' em a few extra ' green stamps ' with their new bosses . But I suspect those bosses are well aware of the environmental importance of all those millions of dollars in excise taxes , stamps , and licenses that we shooters pay in . Secretary of the Interior Babbitt is a politician , too , and I just ca n't see the feds cutting their own flow of excise-tax funding for habitat research and refuges , or risking a national uprising of hunter and shooter votes against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting  --  unless there 's some proven biological need for it . " " They never proved the need for steel shot for ducks and geese in the first place , " somebody said , drawing a round of applause . " Lawsuits forced ' em into going nationwide on that , " argued Legal Eagle . " And lawsuits are what could force the switch to steel shot for everything , or at least make the feds do lengthy , expensive studies or an Environmental Impact Statement . But all that takes time ; litigation is expensive , and anti-hunting groups can get more media exposure by wearing bunny suits at public demonstrations . The responsible environmental groups  --  or at least the ones I 've worked with on waterfowl habitat projects  --  are well aware of how many hunters and shooters could be priced out of paying stamps , licenses , and excise taxes for habitat if they had to use high-priced steel loads for everything . " " So what about all these shooting ranges getting shut down ? " a heckler persisted . " Big problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . " Confusion and public hysteria over lead is being used to close ranges when the real motivations are more likely to be noise or that somebody in the neighborhood does n't happen to like guns . " Maybe this whole situation is a long-needed wake-up call for hunters and the groups representing them to get their stuff together and fight for common-sense amendments and clarifications of environmental regulations being used for purposes that were never intended . Most hunters have never written a Congressman , never bothered to join the NRA or WLFA ( Wildlife Legislative Fund of America ) , or used their weight at all , except maybe to contribute to Ducks Unlimited or somebody . We need to somehow get across that we 're facing a serious situation here that could spread from the ranges into field hunting in a hurry . " Then he sat down and asked what I thought . I told him I 've been spending a lot of late-night hours researching all of this , mainly trying to find out what 's happening  --  as opposed to what might happen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogyman does not appear so imminent as the scarecrow talk would have it . Or let 's hope not . If such a major change was coming from the feds , one of the first to know would be Dr. Keith Morehouse , of the USFWS Office of Migratory Bird Management in Washington , who 'd probably write the regulations . He says that there 's no such plan to his knowledge , and no scientific data indicating a sufficient need for it . I asked him why , then , did the USFWS in 1991 ban lead shot for hunting any species on its refuges in Region One ( in the West ) , and has now required that hunters shoot quail and pheasant with steel shot on some of its refuges in Region Two ( in the Southwest ) for the 1992-93 season ? " To prevent certain concentrated refuge populations of waterfowl from ingesting lead pellets fired at other species , " says Morehouse . " But that does n't imply that lead should be banned everywhere in the country . A number of states also restrict the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't meant the state has banned lead everywhere else . " Some of us may find minimal solace in that , recalling that it was not the feds , but a lawsuit from the National Wildlife Federation ( NWF ) that years ago forced the USFWS to go nationwide with its steel-shot regulations for waterfowl . In that situation there was a great deal of data ( and a bunch of carcasses of lead-poisoned waterfowl and endangered bald eagles ) to indicate some need for protection of waterfowl from lead shot . But scattered pellets dispersed over vast upland areas appear to pose no significant problem for quail , pheasants , or clay targets . In fact , the same powerful NWF organization that sued in behalf of nontoxic shot for waterfowl is now saying it has no intention of pushing for the use of steel shot for upland game . " The legal requirement to use steel shot on waterfowl is totally justified . However , based on scientific information we have reviewed , NWF does not have on its agenda pursuing an all-out switch to nontoxic shot for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another powerful environmental group , the Environmental Defense Fund ( EDF ) , recently sued the USFWS to force a ban on lead sinkers ( regulations for which are to be announced in January ) . The fact that the organization did not at the same time sue for a nationwide ban on lead shot should be considered good news , as well as evidence of common-sense environmental responsibility by the EDF . And that 's particularly significant , as the EDF is the group recently mentioned on Public Television as having had enough stroke with President Clinton to convince him to appoint Bruce Babbit to Interior Secretary rather than to the Supreme Court . No , I do n't necessarily trust everything I hear . And I 'm surely not suggesting that some " scarecrow " could n't come to life in a hurry or that the other shoe wo n't someday drop on the lead-shot situation . Environmental lead is a problem being argued around the world , and a few countries are going steel shot for everything . But their circumstances are , in many respects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel shot for upland or target use would bear responsibility for reducing funding of much more important environmental programs including the national park system , which was established and paid for by hunters . Wildlife would wind up being hurt , and so would the economy . An estimated 380,000 jobs are connected with the shooting industry , and hunting and shooting travel alone keeps a lot of people working . As Bob Delfay of the National Shooting Sports Foundation ( NSSF ) recently pointed out in a letter to the Northeastern governors , many hunting-related jobs are in rural communities where a successful hunting season greatly affects the success of the business season . This is serious business , but let 's not make it any scarier than it really is . For example , a well-intentioned but incorrect article in the June 1993 issue of Shotgun Sports , titled " Ready or Not  --  Steel Shot Target Loads , " referred to a " new EPA policy " that would require the closing of all shooting ranges that fire lead over water by a deadline of January 7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people planning shooting ranges as well as others who saw it as handwriting on the wall that the switch to steel for everything was being plotted for 1997 . But what many readers and scarecrow squawkers missed was a quick-as-possible correction made by the magazine 's publisher which said that the statements attributed to the EPA had mistakenly been taken from a letter written by a state committee , and not the EPA . In fact , EPA sources checked out by the USFWS and by the shooting industry knew nothing about any such nationwide plan or deadline . It was a committee within the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources which had recommended that the state agency require the use of nonlead ammunition by gun clubs shooting over water ( in Wisconsin ) by January 1 , 1997 . But so far it is a recommendation , not a regulation , and it does not mention steel shot for upland hunting . Very much on top of that situation , as well as many others threatening to pop up across the country , is the NRA 's Range Development Division Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knowledge of the various legal threats to ranges . He says the problem is not grounded in the EPA but in local problems stirred by extremists . " A very few of these people  --  I call ' em environmental terrorists  --  can get together and file a class action suit that puts a range operator into such a financial squeeze of legal costs that he may shut down rather than fight them , " Whiting explains . So how many ranges have actually been shut down ? Nobody knows exactly . The NSSF was doing a nationwide survey of state wildlife agencies as this was going to press , and their data indicated that the majority of states have had no range closures , at least not yet . However , among those either shut down or not operating pending lawsuits or appeals ( according to my best information ) are the Milwaukee Gun Club , the Lincoln Park Gun Club in Chicago , Remington 's Lordship Range in Connecticut , the Deerfield Gun Club in Illinois , and the Dover Bay Gun Club in Bay Village , Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pellet use by a Regional Water Quality Control Board following a suit by a small environmental group called BayKeeper . Those clubs include Richmond Rod &; Gun Club ( which was sued by BayKeeper ) . Now being looked at by the water board ( according to newspaper reports ) are Chevron Rod &; Gun Club , Pittsburgh Police Range , Circle S. Ranch in Petaluma , Field &; Sports Park in Santa Clara County , Peninsula Sportsman 's Club in Menlo Park , Newark Sportsman 's Club , and the Pacific Rod &; Gun Club on Lake Merced in San Francisco . I asked the NRA 's Whiting for a ballpark estimate of the number of ranges right now facing some sort of investigation or threat of closure , and he estimated about fifty nationwide . The good news , he said , is that two ranges are being opened for every one that gets shut down . " We 're offering range operators and builders the information they need to avoid such problems , by giving them help complying with all the various regulations in advance , " Whiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and the news media distinguish the difference between spent lead bullets or shot pellets ( which can be " mined " and recovered ) and the much more dangerous forms of lead in lead-based paints , lead salts , and tetraethyl lead in gasoline . " There 's no realistic public health hazard from shooting-range lead , which is much less soluble and wo n't leach down into aquifers or pollute underground water . If surface rainwater runs over exposed lead into some creek or storm sewer , that does n't necessarily mean there 's any real health hazard to people in the area who drink their water from the tap rather than the creek . " Whiting can cite court decisions backing his contentions , and a trove of helpful information can be had for $3 by writing the NRA Range Department , National Rifle Association of America , Dept . FS , 1600 Rhode Island Ave . NW. , Washington , D.C. 20036 , telephone ( 202 ) 828-6192 . In a recent TV documentary , a doctor with years of research experience into lead hazards said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that there is actually less lead poisoning in this country now than there was thirty years ago , and that the incidence continues to drop . Most responsible environmental organizations know a great deal about the dangers of lead  --  real or perceived . In 1992 , the National Wildlife Federation went to bat for recreational shooting in a letter to the EPA which stated that the NWF does not believe that the discharge of sporting ammunition should be subject to the regulations originally designed to relate to the disposal of hazardous waste ( attempts having been made to consider shooting ranges under the same laws used to regulate toxic waste dumps ) . The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute ( SAAMI ) has just hired a law firm experienced in the lead situation to provide information and/or assistance to concerned range owners and shooting clubs .

The question that most readers are asking me is not whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . They also want to know if the loads would be worth shooting , and if they would be safe in fine target guns . I 'll be writing a column on that soon , but I can tell you that the latest nontoxic target and upland loads I 've tested work surprisingly well , and even the steel loads can be safely used in many doubles and other guns that previously could n't have been recommended for steel waterfowl loads . How soon , if ever , we 'll have to use those loads I do n't claim to know . In a society prone to emotional fluctuations between eco-smart and eco-silly , anything can happen . But whatever does , those of us who care most will stick to our shooting . Life would n't be the same without it . <p>
