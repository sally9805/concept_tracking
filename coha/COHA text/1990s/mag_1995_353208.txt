The spectacle was sickeningly familiar . Thousands of refugees , most of them Rwandan Hutu , clogged the rutted roads of central Africa last week . Thousands of men , women and children were on the move in Burundi , fleeing camps where they had sought asylum last year from the civil war in their homeland next door . Now , spurred by the dread of more ethnic killing , they trudged east toward Tanzania . As they passed other Hutu camps , more thousands gathered up their meager belongings to join the trek . About 40,000 refugees were stalled Saturday just outside Tanzania after the country closed its borders . <P> For months , sporadic tribal killing has been fracturing Burundi into tense ethnic cantonments , which many officials in the country and outside fear could explode into full-scale genocide . Fresh and ominous spasms of bloodshed erupted in the capital as well as the Majuri refugee camp near the town of Ngozi , where armed men killed 12 Rwandan Hutu and wounded 22 last Monday . That attack , presumably carried out by Tutsi militiamen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bujumbura : bands of Tutsi swept through mixed neighborhoods , driving out members of the other tribal group , fighting with Hutu militia , shooting stragglers , burning houses and shops . Families were shot in the street and left to die ; mothers came home to murdered children . <P> " Youths came with guns and took everything , ' ' says Ahmed Brown , a Hutu whose left eye is swollen from a blow with a club . He is still living in his old neighborhood but says , " I am so afraid . We have seen too many people gunned down . ' ' Bujumbura is now mainly Tutsi , its Hutu residents forced into a few ghettolike areas like the northern section of the city called Kamenge . Out in the countryside , Hutu gangs roam the hills around Tutsi encampments , preying on those who venture out . <P> Rumors spread quickly last week that the Tutsi-dominated army was about to attack Kamenge and seven major refugee camps that provide shelter to 200,000 Hutu from Rwanda . Tutsi paramilitary groups may have spread the rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burundi is still in shock after the massacres in Rwanda last year , in which more than 500,000 Rwandans , mostly Tutsi , were slaughtered . <P> The latest outbreak of communal violence was touched off by a pair of assassinations last month that have put extremists into power on both sides . First a Hutu government minister , a respected moderate , was shot and killed . A few days later Hutu vigilantes took their revenge by kidnapping a moderate Tutsi politician , a former mayor of Bujumbura . His body was found crucified and eviscerated . <P> Officials in Burundi and the world outside have been watching anxiously to see if the Rwandan nightmare would repeat itself here . The ethnic makeup in Burundi is the same as in Rawanda : 80% Hutu , 15% Tutsi . The difference is that in Burundi , the minority Tutsi have always controlled the armed forces , while in Rwanda the majority had the weapons . After the assassination of two Presidents in 18 months , the current government is a shaky coalition of the two rival tribal groups . Moderates willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says a senior foreign-aid worker , " the country has been taken hostage by the hard-liners . ' '
