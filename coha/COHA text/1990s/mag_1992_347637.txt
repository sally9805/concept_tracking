Mathea Falco 's favorite image for the failure of American drug-fighting policy is the thin gray line of 10 radar balloons , each costing $20 million , that stretch across the U.S. border with Mexico . Their purpose is to spot cross- border drug flights . But there is no evidence that the balloons have led to any increase in drug seizures . Like the claims that the nation 's drug problem can be solved by law enforcement , they may need to be deflated . <P> Falco , a drug-abuse specialist who was Jimmy Carter 's Assistant Secretary of State for international narcotics matters , has written a new book , The Making of a Drug-Free America : Programs That Work ( Times Books ; $22 ) . A consumer guide to the most promising and cost-effective efforts in antidrug education , treatment and grass-roots action against dealers , Falco 's book argues for giving drug education and treatment priority over law enforcement because , she insists , those approaches work better than most people realize . " We know that drug abuse is driven largely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we have learned to reduce demand . " <P> But first , she says , the nation has to move away from the Reagan-Bush policies that transformed the war against drugs into a vain attempt at sealing the borders while rounding up dealers and users at home . Ronald Reagan dramatically shifted federal drug-fighting dollars from education and treatment to law enforcement . George Bush sustained those priorities , nearly doubling the antidrug outlay to $12 billion but devoting nearly 70% of it to the cops-and-Coast Guard approach . That strategy has contributed to the costly doubling of the prison population during the past decade . But while casual drug use may have declined , the number of heavy drug abusers , a crime-prone population now estimated at 5.5 million , is still rising . <P> Falco argues persuasively that tilting the balance back to education and treatment would substantially cut the number of cocaine and heroin addicts . Even if that required higher initial spending , it would be a bargain when lower crime and health-care costs are counted in  --  to say nothing of reduced human misery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug war that starts in the classrooms . Too bad that in her view it generally begins on the wrong foot . While Washington offers American schools $500 million each year to adopt drug-use-prevention programs , school officials are on their own when it comes to deciding which curriculum is most likely to work . <P> " There 's virtually no guidance , " says Falco . " And the research on drug programs is often inaccessible and incomprehensible . " Bewildered school administrators find themselves drawn to the programs that have the most eye- catching props , including classroom games and hand puppets . But most of them do n't deliver . Of 350 programs examined by one 1988 study , just three produced decreases in student use of drugs , alcohol or tobacco . <P> Falco has found , surprisingly , that the most successful classroom programs use techniques like role-playing to equip self-conscious teens with basic ! social skills , such as as how to conduct a conversation or respond to rudeness , as well as how to resist peer pressure to get high . The working assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations are less likely to turn to drugs for comfort .
