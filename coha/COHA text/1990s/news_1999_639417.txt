<p> Twelve years ago , he was the most famous smart aleck in Colorado . A former used-car salesman in a bow tie , he turned his suburb into the state 's biggest boomtown , mocked the mayor of Denver as a 98-pound weakling and vowed to build a domed stadium for major-league baseball in Aurora . <p> He even got Gov . Bill Owens his first job in politics . <p> Then this larger-than-life life took a truly odd turn . <p> Dennis Champine , ex-mayor of Aurora , quit his job , hauled his camping trailer and a dog named Tramp on a year-long soul-searching trip through Mexico and along the U.S. coasts and then returned to Colorado to earn his college diploma at age 54 . <p> Along the way , he was convicted of drunken driving and spent 20 days in jail . <p> Today the former politician , who once was courted as a Republican candidate for governor , is laboring through his final year of law school in Boulder , carrying $ 50,000 of student loan debt and volunteering his time defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a journey and not a destination . You could say I 've followed a few different paths , ' Champine said . <p> ' He is a man for all seasons , is n't he ? ' said University of Colorado president John Buechner , another former politician who wrote a letter of reference for Champine 's law school applications . <p> In the go-go days of the state 's last development boom , Champine was one of the most recognized politicians in Colorado . Appointed to the Aurora City Council at age 33 , Champine was elected mayor five years later , in 1979 , and quickly turned his sleepy suburb into a fixture on front pages . <p> After persuading the city to dump a 10-year ban on annexations , Champine led Aurora through a massive growth spurt , doubling the city 's size in just three years from 62 square miles to 125 square miles . <p> When Aurora surpassed Denver in physical size , a cocky Champine started talking about the ' Aurora-Denver metropolitan area . ' Strutting increased after Aurora annexed a shopping mall site Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivalry personal . At a 1985 softball game between the Aurora and Denver city councils , Champine lampooned the slight stature of his counterpart , Mayor Federico Pena . <p> ' He must weigh 98 pounds sopping wet , ' Champine swaggered . ' I 'm going to go kick some sand on him . ' <p> Sure enough , Pena got dusted . When Champine proclaimed that the loser of the same softball game would be forced to annex Commerce City , the Commerce City Council officially denounced him . <p> Champine shrugged it off . After all , there were n't many other politicians who could have publicly insulted Denver and Commerce City , pulled a gun on an auto mechanic in a dispute over car repairs , slapped the Aurora city attorney in an argument , proposed a new domed stadium in Aurora for major-league baseball and pro football , showed up at a Super Bowl news conference wearing an ' Aurora ' Broncos hat and arrived at city council meetings in a gold Mercedes 450 SL - and still be courted by Republicans to run for governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . With money he earned as a commercial real estate agent , Champine bought a minor-league hockey team , the Colorado Rangers , and then watched his investment go sour . <p> ' About halfway into it , I realized I was probably going to go broke , so I started selling everything I had , ' Champine said . <p> He sold his cabin near McClure Pass , some horses , his Mercedes and just about all other remainders of the financial good life . <p> At the last minute , he found a buyer for his hockey team . He was left with some cash but few possessions . <p> Champine 's children were grown and he and his second wife had just divorced . <p> ' She was a model and actress and 18 years younger than me , and she was headed to the limelight and I was headed away from it , ' Champine said . <p> So he worked as a bartender for four months in a LoDo bar , After Ten , and then packed his dog into a camper trailer and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Texas , he ate lunch with the former mayor , a friend , who suggested that Champine check out San Miguel de Allende , Mexico , a colonial city in the mountains northwest of Mexico City . <p> Champine , who is not fluent in Spanish , enjoyed the Mexican city so much that he stayed there with his dog for eight months . Then he traveled up and down the U.S. Pacific and Atlantic coasts for another four months . <p> ' When you 're living out of a car for a year , you get a lot of introspection , too much even , ' Champine said . ' I finally got to the point where I was thinking , ' Oh , God , no more mirrors , just give me windows . " <p> One point of all his self-reflection , though , was his desire to earn a college diploma . He moved to a cabin in southern Colorado 's Cuchara Valley and enrolled at Trinidad State Junior College . <p> A former used-car and tire salesman who joined the Marines after his high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered he liked it . <p> After a year at Trinidad State , Champine enrolled at the University of Colorado at Denver , where he earned a degree in political science . <p> Then one night , while driving to his girlfriend 's house in Boulder , Champine was pulled over on U.S. 36 and arrested for drunken driving . It was his second drunken-driving offense in five years , and his 1995 conviction resulted in a 20-day jail sentence in the Boulder County Jail . <p> ' I needed to go there . It taught me humility , ' Champine said . ' They did n't know who I was . They only knew I was a jailbird . Part of my sentence was cleaning the floors at the Penfield Tate Day Care Center , and I was thinking , ' I knew Penfield Tate . He was mayor of Boulder . Now I 'm cleaning the floors . " ( Tate died in 1993 ; his son , who has the same name , now is a Democratic state representative from Denver ) . <p> Champine said his drunken-driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' I remember sitting in the courtroom and seeing the lawyers being friendly and the judge being friendly and everyone is being friendly to everyone - except for you . Nobody talks to the defendant , ' Champine said . ' I decided to go to law school in that courtroom . ' <p> He enrolled at the University of Colorado Law School at age 54 and was recognized by almost no one . When he began volunteering for the public defender 's office at drug court in Denver , though , some people at the courthouse recognized him because of his bow tie . <p> Champine switched to regular neckties . <p> Now he volunteers three days a week in drug court and another day a week at the Denver County Jail , representing convicted drug felons accused of violating the terms of their court-ordered treatment . <p> He said he finally feels like his work is rewarding . <p> ' I love drug court , ' said Champine , who advises clients in precourt sessions but must abstain from some courtroom work until he 's officially certified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about defining treatment needs . As someone who has struggled with alcohol on and off all my life , I feel good about getting help for the people who need it . ' <p> Denver Deputy District Attorney Kim Nash , who often goes up against Champine in drug court , said , ' He 's very conscientious and very well-prepared . He obviously cares a lot for his clients , and he does a good job for them . ' <p> Champine is scheduled to graduate from law school in May and take the Colorado bar exam in July . After two DUIs and 20 days in jail , he concedes his political career probably is over . <p> He does look at politicians such as Owens - whom Champine helped get his first political job , an appointment to the Aurora Planning and Zoning Board - with a certain amount of awe . <p> ' Bill decided very early in life that he wanted to be a U.S. senator , and I 've never seen him veer from his course , ' said Champine , who noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a scholarship . ' I admire people who decide early on exactly what they want to do . I used to try to stick with a plan to orchestrate things far down the road . But I found out that closes off too many options . <p> ' Most people go through their midlife crisis in their late 30s and are over it in a year or two . I 'm 57 and still figuring out where I 'll end up . '
