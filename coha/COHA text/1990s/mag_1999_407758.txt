A FIRST COUSIN TO THE BLUSH-ALSO AN INVOLUNTARY suffusion of blood-the erection is one of the few bodily occurrences over which a male does n't always have control . In his teenage years , this means the fear of priapism in study hall or , the ultimate embarrassment , during the long walk to the podium to accept his varsity letter . In young adulthood , it means routine sexual performance . There are plenty of things to worry about between the sheets , but for the red-blooded " he-man " in his 20s and 30s , maintaining an erection generally is n't one of them . So it comes as a terrible shock to vigorous men barely into their middle years when erections do n't always appear on command ; when no amount of puffing , squeezing , contracting , pushing , willing , Kegeling , arousing , begging or believing will make a limp penis achieve the state of stiffness for which it was designed . This is not the inevitable result of aging . The majority of men will coast through middle and old age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put a little more effort into attaining an orgasm-not a bad thing , their wives might say . But the numbers of what is properly called " erectile dysfunction " are unsettling , if a man is anywhere near the classic welcome-to-middle-age birthday . A study on aging sponsored by Boston University suggests that as many as 22 percent of 40-year-olds and 49 percent of 60-year-olds have had at least moderate problems achieving an erection . Many things can cause this.The known villains come in two basic flavors : organic and psychological . Organic includes such dampers as atherosclerosis , diabetes , prostate- and colon-cancer treatment , certain medications ( for high blood pressure , for example ) , alcoholism , age-related decrease in testosterone levels and other hormonal imbalances , even trauma from narrow bicycle seats . And , more than likely , smoking . " The data are just now trickling in on smoking as a risk factor , " says William Steers , M.D. , chairman of the urology department at the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center . " If more teenage guys knew they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far greater deterrent to smoking than these ad campaigns telling them they 're going to get lung cancer . " Under psychological causes , you can include the many forms of stress-perhaps the single largest mental-health cause of sexual dysfunction . Divorce , the death of a parent , financial troubles , the shock of retirement ( see " Retiring Gracefully " ) - you name it.To say nothing of the sexually specific stresses such as anxiety over performance , fear of doing damage during sex as a result of a stroke or a weak heart , marital or relationship problems and a host of other mind-bending neuroses . " A lot of erectile dysfunction is simply a matter of female arousal of the male , " explains Dr. Steers . " At least a third of all women say they do n't find sex pleasurable , so the partner says , Why bother to get it fixed ? ' But let 's not be so fast to absolve ourselves of responsibility , for the numbers work both ways : it also means that a third of all men are unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the forgotten factor in the Age of Viagra has become the woman , for without a loving , supportive , mutually respectful relationship , no amount of pharmacology will provide anything but a temporary fix . " Most people with erectile dysfunction can be helped , " avers Loren G. Lipson , M.D. , chief of geriatric medicine at the University of Southern California School of Medicine , " but the right relationship is absolutely paramount . " For my part , I am 63 and became impotent nearly two years ago as a result of a prostatectomy . Unfortunately , I found Viagra ineffective , so I asked an acquaintance about the efficacy of his chosen course of treatment , which happened to be penile injections . " Oh , it 's painless , " he assured me , " but all that fussgetting the stuff out of the refrigerator , adding water , getting it into the syringe . If Sharon Stone came through my bedroom door , I 'd do it . But for my wife ? Forget it . " Obviously , his problem was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male sexuality , " says Karen Donahey , Ph.D. , director of Northwestern University 's Sex &; Marital Therapy Program . " There 's the myth that men always want to have sex and are ready at the drop of a hat . As men get older , they require more stimulation before they can get an erection , but a lot of women assume , Oh , he does n't find me attractive anymore . ' This is only going to increase a man 's nervousness , and something that may have been just a natural part of the aging process suddenly becomes a real problem . " Donahey adds : " When women admit to not enjoying sex , we need to find out exactly what 's happening , and a lot of them will say , ' I really love spending more time kissing and caressing , but I know that does n't really count . We have to have intercourse. ' // " When Viagra came out , some women were actually concerned , thinking this would mean their husbands would go back to focusing on intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the men had begun experiencing erectile problems . They 'd been expanding their repertoire , which actually met the women 's needs better . For them , as for many mature women , creativity had turned out to be even more exciting than penetration . " Viagra was going to fix everything , we were told by newsmagazines , medical authorities ( self-appointed and otherwise ) and especially comedians . Well , it has n't : partly because only about 70 percent of men with erectile dysfunction respond to it , and partly because it is too often assumed that Viagra makes you amorous and gives you an erection . ( It only makes it possible for you to have one if adequately aroused . ) But largely because Viagra treats a symptom rather than solves a problem . " People who take it are helping the arterial flow , but they are n't correcting the arteries , " insists Michael Roizen , M.D. , ' a University of Chicago gerontologist and author of RealAge : Are You as Young as You Can Be ? ( Cliff Street/HarperCollins ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably more than 90 percent of the affected , other than those who 've had prostate surgery , is arterial dysfunction . " In his book , Dr. Roizen advocates structured exercise , careful nutrition and a variety of vitamins and stress-reducing activities to rebuild a man 's sexual well-being . " The great thing about arterial health , " he points out , " is that until you do structural damage , it 's never too late to make your arteries younger.There are no data that say sexual performance should degrade with middle age . As long as you maintain your arteries , you should be able to perform at 75 as you did at 35 . " Nonetheless , for the neglectful and lazy among us-you know who you are ; do n't try to sneak out of the room-there are more pop-a-pill fixes coming . " Pharmaceutical companies are developing huge new divisions devoted solely to genitourinary research , " says Dr. William Steers , who knows , because he was a consultant and lead investigator for one of the original Viagra clinical trials in North America and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature 's normal signal , but soon-within the next five yearsthere will be a drug that works on the brain , say , to trigger arousal . And other drugs will block the nerves that inhibit erections . As a man ages , the penis loses some of the smooth muscle that 's needed for an erection-more tolling of his biological clock , because nature does n't seem to want older men to reproduce . But people are working on attacking that with gene therapies , asking , How can we keep smooth muscle available ? ' They 're going to be coming out with very clever ways to preserve sexual functioning in the aging male . " But what about the time-honored business of growing old gracefully ? Rather than turning ourselves into a nation of gamboling geezers desperate to set sexual records , perhaps we should learn to adapt to the inevitable . " Couples can take advantage of the fact that men take longer to get aroused as they grow older , " Karen Donahey suggests . " At that point in life , men and women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response . This might also be a time when they explore other ways of sexually fulfilling each other . " A lot of women are afraid to broach the subject of their husbands ' sexual problems.They do n't want to embarrass them . It would be much more helpful for them to encourage their husbands to talk to a doctor , to see if there 's something that can be done sooner rather than later . " , ( See " Reality Checkups . " ) In an era when erectile-dysfunction commercials appear on television , the anxiety level for men ratchets ever upward . " I 'm worried about men in their 40s who are fundamentally healthy and whose sexual vigor , though normal , is not quite what it was twenty years ago , " says Dr. Donald Black , a professor of psychiatry at the University of Iowa College of Medicine . " But they 're perceiving it as abnormal and inappropriately requesting Viagra or even a penile implant . It 's normal for sexual performance to taper off . Some quite old men will have fairly active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy to understand that this is part of aging . " In the end , sex for many men over 40 must change and evolve . I know . I 've found a treatment for my own impotence that 's good enough that I 'll call it a cure.And it 's a cure because the most important benefit of revitalized sexual ability is not the act itself but the knowledge that you once again can make love . My panacea happens to be the very same penile injections that my acquaintance derided . My closest friends invariably wince when I mention it , but the truth is that it 's painlessdone with a needle about the size of a hair , into an area where there seem to be few nerve endings . Yet it would n't work without a loving and open relationship-and an attitude toward sex that does n't always romanticize it into the spiritual stratosphere . After all , perhaps the only logical response to sex with a syringe is mutual hilarity . Sex may inevitably be bound by certain chronological limitations ; love , however , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
