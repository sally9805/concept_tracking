Without warning , a rare disease was robbing me of my vision . In a frantic race against the darkness , I studied the faces of my daughter and husband committing them to memory . For I knew I might never see them again . // March 8 , 1991 I rub my eyes when I wake up and find a sticky wetness on my cheeks . I 'd been dreaming about my brother , Robin , and I must have been crying in my sleep . I go into the bathroom , and bring my face close to the mirror . Without my contact lenses in , my reflection is blurry . I grope for my glasses beside the bed , and go look again . I still ca n't see anything wrong except that my right eye is wet , the lashes clumped into points . I hold a washcloth against the eye . If it 's some kind of infection , at least it has n't spread to the other eye . " Sangre ! " The scream startles me . It is Teresa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's medicine bottle in her hand . She must have come into the bathroom to ask me a question . Kelsey had been in the hospital with a respiratory infection and last night , after we 'd brought her home , was the first time Kenny and I had had a full night 's sleep in three days . " Sangre ! " Teresa screams again . I have no idea what she 's saying , but her screams are frightening me . She reaches out , pulling the washcloth away gently . " Blood ! " she shouts . Now blood is a word I understand . " What blood ? Where ' ' ? " I ask She points to my eye and the washcloth . I look , but I do n't see anything . I go back into the bedroom . Teresa follows me. start to call out for my husband and then remember it 's Sunday morning , Kenny 's birthday , and a group of his friends have taken him out early to play tennis . I hear my daughter calling to me from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Teresa , " I say , trying to sound calm . " Please take care of Kelsey . I do n't want her to see me . " I grab the phone to call friends for help . I give up after I reach the second answering machine and decide to drive myself over to the clinic . take a small pillow off the bed and hold it against my right eye . The cushion makes it feel better , like a big , soft bandage . sit there for a few minutes , taking deep breaths . I feel our dog , Jake , licking me and sniffing around the pillow . Then something occurs to me : Jake sleeps on the bed with us . Maybe he got his paw in my eye . He 's scratched my cheek before . He must 've cut the outside of my eyelid , and I ca n't see it in the mirror because my eye is open when I 'm looking at it . This theory calms me. grab the car keys , shout to Teresa that I am going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The clinic is only four blocks away . I stare straight ahead , still holding the pillow against my injured eye . At the traffic light , I notice my left hand gripping the wheel so tightly that my knuckles are white . I take a deep breath . Just a scratch , I tell myself . I might need an antibiotic ointment . Maybe some sutures . I flinch , thinking about getting a shot of Novocain in my eyelid . I drive to the end of the clinic parking lot , which is vacant . I do n't trust myself to park between other cars . At the reception desk , I am asked if it is an emergency . I take the pillow off my face . The receptionist gasps . " Come right in , " she says . She ushers me into an examination room and tells me that the doctor will be in immediately . " How on earth did you drive here with one eye covered up like that ? " the doctor asks as soon as he enters the room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He comes over and aims a small flashlight into my right eye . " All right , " he says cheerfully . " I do n't see any sign of serious injury . My guess is that the blood must have come from a small capillary vessel that burst during the night . " " You mean there 's nothing to worry about ? " " Well , nothing serious that I can see . " " I think I 'm having trouble with colors , " I say . " Really ? What color is my shirt ? " " A medium brown . " " Really ? It 's a very bright red , " he says slowly . " You have lost the color red . " He says this like the color red is something I should have taken better care of . It has never occurred to me that it is possible to lose a color . " What does that mean ? " " Let 's test your distance vision , and then we 'll talk about the possibilities , " he says in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard before . He hands me an oversize plastic spoon . " Cover your left eye , and read the chart , " he says . I put on my glasses and follow his instructions . I see nothing in front of me but a fuzzy gray cloud . I drop the plastic spoon and it clatters to the floor . " Oh , God ! " " What 's wrong ? " I ca n't answer him . I do n't know what 's wrong . I cover my left eye again , this time with my hand . I look straight at the doctor . He disappears into a gray fog . I pull my hand away as if it has been burned . He comes back into view . No. it ca n't be . " I ca n't see anything with my right eye , " I say . He stares for a few seconds . " You 're sure ? " " Yes , " I say , my voice high and squeaky with panic . I wait for his next move . All my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my uncle , as well as many of my friends . I spent two years practicing health-care law in a large hospital where I defended the staff doctors in malpractice suits , negotiated their contracts , and worked with them to develop hospital policies and procedures . I always respected their knowledge and experience . Underlying this respect was the expectation that when I came to them with my medical problems , they would put out my fires too . " What are you going to do to fix my eye ? " I now ask this doctor . He steps back as if I have slapped him . Then he says something that I have heard doctors say only when their deposition is being taken . " I 'm sorry , but this problem is beyond my expertise . " " What ? " I am stunned by his sudden loss of confidence . " Do you have a regular internist ? " " Yes ... yes , " I stammer . " Bill Lang . " His face brightens . " I know Bill . We interned together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . " He is grinning at me , clearly relieved . The intercom buzzes . It 's the receptionist . " I 'm going to have to see a few other patients , " the doctor says . " I want you to call somebody to come get you . Use this phone . I 'll be back , and we 'll talk some more . " He is dumping me , but , at least , he 's trying to be gentle about it . " Call your husband . If he 's not home , call a friend , " he says over his shoulder as he walks out the door . I decide that I will not give this kind of news to Kenny or anybody over the phone . I ca n't stay here one more second . I have to go home . I pick up my purse and walk out the door . The hall is empty . I go into the waiting room , then out to the parking lot . I hear the receptionist calling me , but I keep moving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sick and may need me . I have to go home . KENNY 'S FACE IS PALE WHEN I WALK IN THE DOOR . " Thank God , " he says . He 's holding the telephone receiver against his ear , but his eyes are fixed on me . " Bill , she 's right here . I 'll put her on . " " What 's happened ? " Kenny whispers as he hands me the phone . " Teresa was crying and carrying on about blood all over your face . Then some clinic doctor calls . He says you ran out on him , and he called Bill , and now Bill 's talking about you going to the hospital . For God 's sake , what 's going on ? " I take the phone and cover the mouthpiece with my hand . " I do n't know exactly , " I squeak . Our voices always change when there is an emergency ; mine rises , and Kenny 's lowers to a whisper . " Hi , Bill . Sorry to ruin your weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jackie , I need you to tell me what 's happened . Every detail . Why did n't you call me right away ? " I take a deep breath . Bill is not an alarmist ; he 's easygoing and slow to leap to conclusions . But now he 's not sounding like himself either . He 's talking double time , his voice picking up speed with every word . " Well , it did n't seem worth paging you on Sunday , " I say . " I did n't think it was that big a deal . " " Have you had trouble with your vision before this morning ? " " I do n't think so . " " Have you had trouble with your balance lately ? " " Well ... " I roll this over in my mind . I had bumped into a wall yesterday morning at the hospital , but I blamed that on fatigue . I tell Bill this , and I can hear him taking notes . " Okay , here 's the plan , " he says after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your brain done over at the hospital . Then , you 'll have that eye examined by an ophthalmologist . Then I 'll give you a complete physical , and then ... Well , we 'll take it from there . " Photograph The author today , with her husband , Kenny , and their children , Kelsey and Benjamin . // " Bill , I wo n't he able to get on the MRI schedule for days . Why do n't we start with the eye doctor tomorrow ? " There is an uncomfortable pause . " Jackie , we need to do these things right away . Today . " He is speaking slowly and deliberately now . " I 've already gotten a radiologist and a tech to come in for the MRI . And I have a friend , an ophthalmologist. who is going to open his office . You can stop there on the way home from the hospital . " " All of this today ' ' ? " I ca n't believe has booked these appointments for me without checking . " Jackie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . You 've lost one eye already . " I am silent as I try to process this stunning pronouncement . " I 'm sorry , Jackie . I do n't mean to upset you further , " Bill says . " It 's going to be all right . It 's just that we need to get moving . Do you have someone you can leave Kelsey with ? " " Yes , her nanny . " " Good . I 'll meet you in radiology . And Jackie-let Kenny do the driving . " " BILL SAID THAT A TUMOR MIGHT BE PRESSING AGAINST THE OPTIC nerve , " Kenny tells me in the car . " And the fact that it has happened so rapidly could be encouraging . It 's probably not ... " he hesitates . " Anyway , the point is that they can remove a benign tumor and your vision would probably come back soon . " I lift my head . " Are you talking about brain surgery ? " " Bill said that it 's not as bad as it sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Once is more often than I have ever thought about it happening to me , " I say . We drive through the front gate of the hospital where I worked before Kelsey was born . Kenny and I stop at admissions . I recognize the clerk . " Dr. Lang is waiting for you . He wants your husband to stay here and fill out the forms . You 're to go straight to radiology , " she says . Then she smiles , uncertain of herself . " Welcome back ... I guess . " An hour later , the brain scan is done . Bill tells me he 'll call later with the results . " Hurry , " he says . " I 've given Kenny directions to the ophthalmologist 's , and he 's out front waiting for you . " I go out to the car and slide into the front seat . I look at Kenny with my good eye . His lips are pressed tightly together , a signal I can read even with only one eye . " What 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say a prayer there would n't be anything on the films , no sign of a tumor . And he told me I 'd be praying for the wrong result . He 's hoping that that 's precisely what they 'll find . " I think this over from a doctor 's perspective . What could be worse than a brain tumor ? And then I understand , with the kind of understanding that goes straight to the bottom of my stomach . The worst thing for a physician to find is something he ca n't do anything about . MY GRANDFATHER WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE ophthalmology department at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore , where I grew up . All of his grandchildren called him Doc . We thought that was the first and most important part of his name . Since he never asked us to call him anything else , he must have thought so too . When he died , a research center was built in his name . Bob Hope , whose eyes my grandfather had " saved , " gave a speech at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I adored my grandfather , but it was n't until then that I understood what he meant to so many people . Now I think that even he could not save my eye . I tell Kenny this while we sit in the dark lobby of the ophthalmologist 's building , waiting for him to open his office . " There 's no use in having any doctor examine an eye that 's already gone , " I say . Kenny reaches over and draws me close . " But , Jackie , " he whispers , " you still have another eye . " For a long time we hold each other , and it feels like we are the only two people in the world . " I 'm ready for you now , " the ophthalmologist finally says , motioning us into his office . I sit down in the examination chair , and he shines a light in my right eye . " Well , I can see that the pupil is already dilated , " he says with a sigh . " Did another doctor put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , sighing again . " Wellthat certainly shows you . " " Shows me what ? " " The spontaneous dilation of your pupil shows you are blind in that eye . " He turns off the light . Blind . This is the first time that word has been used in my presence . It is devastating to hear . As far as I can remember , my grandfather never spoke that word out loud . " Those eyes have gone where the woodbine twineth , " he used to say when he was discussing an unfortunate case . He was , in his time , the most skilled eye surgeon in the world , but it was the rare operation that could restore an eye once it was gone . He pioneered research into various therapies to prevent blindness . He believed in avoiding loss before it happened . I have lost vision in one eye , but I still have the other , I tell myself . As if reading my mind , Kenny says , " But her left eye is fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The doctor walks over to his desk . " Personally , I have never seen a case of this symptom presenting bilaterally , " he says in the same flat tone he used for the word blind . From him , good and bad news is delivered with equal detachment . " So that means it wo n't spread to the other eye ? " I ask . " No . It 's not that kind of problem , " he says . " Then what kind of problem is it ? " Kenny asks . The doctor takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes . " I 'm sorry , " he says finally , " but I believe this is a symptom of a neurological disease that has been going on for some time . Blindness in one eye is just the first presentation . " " What ? " I ask . " What disease would cause this to happen ? " And as soon as I ask the question , I know I 've made a mistake . It is what they tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question to which you do n't already know the answer . " Multiple sclerosis , " the doctor says . " Optic neuritis-that is , swelling of the optic nerve-is almost always associated with it . " This new piece of information knocks me speechless . I do n't have any firsthand knowledge about multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , but all my visual images are associated with wheelchairs and lack of bodily control . I remember Bill Lang 's earlier question about loss of balance and realize this is where he was leading . Blindness is just a pit stop on the road to multiple sclerosis . The telephone is ringing . We blink at each other for several moments before the doctor picks it up . " It 's for you , " he says , after a moment . " It 's Bill Lang . " " Jackie , I 've just talked to the radiologist , " Bill tells me . " The MRI shows no sign of a mass or tumor anywhere in your brain . However , it does show that your right optic nerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sclerosis , right ? " " Uh-oh , " he says . " I 'm sorry you 've been told that . MS is merely one possibility we have to consider , but I want to examine you first , before we go in that direction . " " You mean I may not have MS ? " " No . We ca n't make a definite diagnosis yet , " Bill says . " Listen , I want to do my own detailed workup tomorrow morning , and then , if necessary , we 'll have a neurologist look at you . He might be able to determine if a second symptom is on its way . " " On its way ? " " Well , yes . A specialist in neurological disorders might be able to detect a change that 's so subtle even the patient does n't notice it yet . " He 's talking about me . I am the patient not noticing . And what could be missing that I did n't realize was missing-yet ? " Oh , Bill , " I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tired and scared . " It 's late . Let 's all go home . " All this talk is n't leading anywhere , and I want this long day to end . WHEN WE GET HOME , I FALL INTO BED , fully clothed . I just want to go to sleep , without moving , without thinking . " Eyestrain , " Kenny is saying . " That 's all it is . Your eyes just need a long rest . " The word evokes a memory . " Eyestrain , " I repeat , trying to bring the memory forward . Kenny goes into the kitchen and when he returns , he lays a cold cloth against my eyes . " Here , " he says . " Ice . I thought maybe it would reduce the swelling of your eyes . " Eye.strain . Now I remember . Ice train . I see my brother , Robin , as a young child , leaning over his train set . He is laughing as he puts an ice cube into the back of the coal car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing at the memory . I tell Kenny the story . I was in second grade and suffering from such a severe headache that I 'd begged to go home early from school . It was an unusual complaint for a little girl , and so our doctor came to the house that night . He diagnosed my problem as eyestrain due to nearsightedness . A short time later , I got my first pair of glasses . " But what about ice train ? " Kenny asks , still not getting it . " Well , Robin got the words confused . He thought we were talking about ice train instead of eyestrain . " There is a moment of silence . which always trails the mention of my brother 's name into any conversation . " I think it would be better not to bring up sad memories of Robin now , " Kenny says softly . " But this memory is happy , " I say , eager to tell him . " So we can talk about it tomorrow , " Kenny says , yawning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn off the lamp . " Please do n't . " I say , suddenly afraid of the dark . Kenny sighs . He sleeps best when it is pitch-black . But tonight my preference rules , and we go to sleep with the lights on . " IT 'S TIME TO SEE Tl IE SPECIALISTS , " BILL Lang tells me after he 's completed his examination the next day . " There is nothing unusual in your blood results , and no sign of a virus that might have attacked your optic nerve . " " What kind of specialists ? " I have hated anything having to do with the word special ever since I heard it used to describe my brother . Robin has special needs . He has to go to a special school with special teachers . My mother always knew that something was wrong with her firstborn and only son . He was a beautiful baby and toddler , with soft blond curls , but his blue eyes never seemed to look directly at anyone . His development was slow . At 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold a spoon . I have told Bill Lang all this before its part of my family medical history , but I feel compelled to repeat it now . I know that autism is classified as a neurological disorder and that my loss of vision is presumed to he a neurological defect . " And that 's where the similarities end , " Bill says . " You have developed this condition at thirty-six with no history of eye trouble other than nearsightedness . Your brother was born with autism even though the diagnosis was late . " " Actually , it was early , " I say . " Robin was one of the first children to be diagnosed as autistic . " Dr. Leo Kanner , the chairman of child psychiatry at Johns Hopkins had taken him on as a favor to my grandfather . It was called Kanner 's syndrome in the early 1950 's . It was renamed infantile autism a few years later . The diagnosis was so new it was n't in the dictionary . When I tried to look it up , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word that sounded most like autistic and that fit my brother . Robin was artistic . Of course , I had always known that . He loved making and building things . He was obsessed with bright colors . He would stay up late , studying pictures with a flashlight . He could never get enough of how the world looked . " But are n't there other things that are the same about these diseases ? " I ask . " There are no similarities between MS and autism , Jackie . Just two unlucky breaks . " " But I was thinking " " I do n't want to cut you off , but I 've made an appointment for you with a neurologist this afternoon . He may have to do some more invasive tests . but I think he can answer your questions better than I can . " I look up at him . 1 am being handed over again , but I know he 's trying to do what is best for me , and there 's nothing else he can do . I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next doctor . In the car , I ca n't stop thinking about the two neurological disorders . Both are unpredictable and incurable . But that 's not what scares me most . Researchers have never discovered why one person in a family develops autism or MS and the others do not , and this is hard for me to accept . If the specialists do n't know how it starts , how can they predict my fate any better than my brother 's ? " 1 know you 're scared , " Kenny says , " but Bill told me that the spinal tap would n't be so bad . " Spinal tap ! So that 's what he had meant by invasive tests . " Think positive thoughts , Jackie , " Kenny coaches . " It really is n't going to be as bad as you think . " " Then why do n't you have the spinal tap since you do n't seem to be worried about it . " My voice is shaking with anger and fear . Now that I am halfblind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like one , a shrunken version of myself . I am screeching at the person I need most in the world . Kenny has steered the car over to the curb . " Listen to me , Jackie . Please . I would take this test for you if I could . It would hurt less than watching the needle go into you . " I nod . I believe him , but it 's not enough . " But you ca n't . " " No , I ca n't . But this is what you must understand : I 'm in this with you . Forever . will live with you and whatever we find out , for better or for worse . " I ca n't say anything . My throat is tight with tears . Until he said those words , did n't understand that what I had feared most was being left alone , like Robin . I nod my head , tears spilling down my cheeks . " I love you forever , " Kenny whispers , as he wipes the tears from my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spelled it " fourever . " Four was his favorite number . And he will be four forever , I remember my mother saying . But she never wanted to give up on her son , even though all the specialists , including my grandfather , told her to give him up , to preserve the rest of the family . " Jackie ' ' ? " Kenny is squeezing my hand to get my attention . " We have to get out of the car . We 're late for the appointment . " I look at the medical office building . Better late than too late-one of Robin 's favorite phrases . I am hearing ghosts . How can I explain this ? Maybe I 'm going crazy . Maybe I 'm not really blind , but I just think I am . " Kenny , do you think it 's possible that all this is in my head ' ' ? " " No , " he says immediately . " Bill told me that it 's not the kind of thing that happens due to emotional stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a psychiatrist ? " " No , I do n't , " he says . " But you have to see a neurologist . Now . " " Okay , let 's go , " I say , getting out of the car . THE NEURO ) l . ( ) GIST LEADS ME THROUGH A series of tests to assess my strength , sensitivity to pressure , hand-eye coordination , reflexes , and balance . We are both concentrating . He is grading my performance , and I am trying lo ace the test . The only sound in the room is the deep breath I release when he calls for the nurse to bring in Kenny . " Unremarkable , " the doctor says , looking into my eyes for the first time and smiling . Kenny walks in to find us both grinning . " Your wife 's nervous system is unremarkable , " the doctor says . I think about how neurology , like many fields in medicine , defines good news with a negative pronouncement . The goal is to be unremarkable . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sink in and enjoy its warmth . " That means she does n't have to worry about MS ? " Kenny asks . The neurologist winces . " I 'm sorry , " he says . " Multiple sclerosis is not a disease that can ever be ruled out . " " What about the spinal tap ? " " I would do a spinal only if my initial examination gave me reason to proceed further . And it has n't . " " I do n't understand , " Kenny is saying . " What do we do next ? " " Nothing more is called for at the moment . " The doctor turns to me . " However , if you have any other problems besides your eye , then you need to call me . " I nod . I slide off the examination table and reach for my purse . I am seconds away from a clean getaway when Kenny puts his hand on my back . " Wait a minute , please , " he says . " I still do n't understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen ? " " All of us live with uncertainty , " the neurologist says . " Jackie has presented a severe symptom that is frequently associated with MS , but there could be another explanation . On rare occasions , there will be an isolated case , episodic blindness , without recurrence . This is called a neurological incident with etiology unknown . " ' " What ? " Kenny is now rubbing his forehead in frustration . " So it could be a freak thing-a once-in-a-lifetime event that 's just happened ? " " Yes , but I do n't want to raise your hopes . The far more likely scenario is that a series and variety of debilitating symptoms will follow over the next few years . " A series and variety of debilitating symptoms . Silently , I beseech Kenny not to ask any more questions . Please . " What is the likelihood that that will happen to Jackie ? What are the percentages ? " The neurologist looks at me now , his face etched with lines of worry . I 've seen this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when finally the one question they do n't want to answer has been asked and there is no turning back . " Well , " he says quietly , " the range of probability for a diagnosis of MS when this optic neuritis presents is eighty to ninety percent . " Kenny grabs my hand , squeezing hard . He never expected such numbers . " I 'm sorry , " the doctor says , trying to fill in the shocked silence . " For people like Jackie , the chances of MS are extremely high . " I glance at Kenny . His head is down . His dark hair shines like patent leather under the fluorescent lights , with none of its usual copper highlights . Staring at it , I remember what terrible news can do to hair . It made mine turn gray when I was 25 , within a few months of learning about Robin 's death . And after our mother died a little more than a year ago , my sister Sally 's beautiful blond curls began to thin and droop ; my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry I ca n't be more helpful , Jackie , " the doctor says .

" " In your case , " he says , " the second symptom would present itself as dramatically as the first . Total shutdown of another part of your central nervous system . Perhaps the spine . You might suddenly fall down because your legs wo n't support you . " My legs buckle instantly . I crumple against the examining table . The doctor quickly moves toward me . " I 'm sorry . I told you that because I did n't want you to worry about little things , like your foot going to sleep . 1 see that I 've upset you . Can I get you some water ? " Water ? How about a tranquilizer ?

I have lost the color red , but I can still read the words in black and white , and reading is an indispensable part of my professional life . Since I left my hospital position , I have made my living by writing . am working on two books at the moment : a novel and a labor-law manual . There is no reason I ca n't continue working on these , even if I do begin to have trouble with my legs . By the time we reach the house , I have softened the horrible pictures in my mind . Hours later in bed , however , I acknowledge that the neurologist 's harsh prognosis has knocked me flat .

Later , we pick up my father , who 's come to L.A. from Baltimore to help us in this crisis , at the airport . I sit in the back seat and gaze at their profiles . They look nothing alike , but I think they are the two most handsome men I have ever known . Dad is tall and lanky , with fair skin and smoky-blue eyes . Kenny is muscular and compact . He has olive skin and brown eyes , deep-set and intense . When my father and my husband turn toward each other and smile , I want to hold the picture in my heart forever . The following morning , it 's Dad who chauffeurs me to my next medical appointment-with a retinal specialist in Beverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility that the retina is somehow involved with the swelling of my optic nerve . As soon as we walk in the door , a nurse announces that I need to be injected with a dye that will light up the vessels in my eyes .

" I 'm on fire , " I say . " Good . " She rushes me into another room . It looks like every other eye doctor 's office . I sit down and close my eyes . A moment later , when I open them , I am looking straight into the doctor 's face . " Did I startle you ? " he says . " We have to be quick . " He shines a flashlight into my right eye .

" I 'd like to speak to him , " he says , turning off the light and handing me a tissue . " You just relax . The hot flash should be over shortly .

" " We have to leave right away , Button , " he says . " This other doctor is double-booked . We have to get down there as soon as we can or we 'll miss him . It 's four freeways from here . Four ! Can you believe that ? " He grabs my arm and pulls me out of the office , his grip strong and determined . We get in the car and head straight to the nearest freeway entrance , tires screeching . Earlier , he drove Kenny 's car carefully . Now , he 's driving like a maniac . " Who is this doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a real specialist , " Dad says . " I do n't feel so lucky . " Dad does n't comment , and I know there is something he 's not telling me . The first thing I notice in the doctor 's waiting room is that everyone has gray hair and is wearing very dark glasses , the kind blind people wear . " Gorman ? Is Gorman here ? " a voice is booming . " Yes , " my father and I answer together . The nurse grabs me by the arm and pulls me through another door . " Now I 'm going to put some drops in both eyes , " she says . " This is going to cause discomfort . Hold still and lean back , please . " My right eye explodes with pain , as if she had poured acid into it . Reflexively , I push her arm away , but she 's quicker . She grabs me by the back of the neck , and forces a drop in the other eye . " Stop it ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " It 's Dad 's voice , but when I turn toward him , I ca n't see anything . " Dad , I ca n't see you ! And it hurts so much ! " " What have you done to her ? " " It 's just the medication . She 's fine . The doctor will be here shortly . " I ca n't see an inch in front of me . I clutch the arms of the chair . I hear a door opening . Someone is touching my forehead . " Hello , " a voice says , a nice voice , with a British accent . Something about the calm tone , relaxes me . " I 'm going to examine your eyes now , " the doctor says . " Please do n't move . " " I wo n't , " I say . The stinging has stopped as suddenly as it started , but I still see nothing . My eyes feel frozen and numb . " All right . All done . Please sit back and relax . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has rolled his chair back , but his hand stays on my wrist , connecting us . " What is it , Doctor ? " Dad asks . " I 'm sorry , " he says softly . " Both optic nerves are shutting down . " " Daddy ? " I call out to the gray-filled air . " Jackie , I 'm sorry , " my father says in an old man 's voice , worn down and tired . " They told me that at the other doctor 's office . I did n't know how to tell you in the car . " " But it 's not supposed to happen in both eyes ! " I protest . " The first eye doctor said that . " " Bilateral optic neuritis of this severity is rare , " the specialist says . " I 'm sure the other physician has never seen it . I 've seen only a handful of cases , and none of them lost so much vision so quickly . " " How quickly ? " I burst out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , I do n't think so , " he says soothingly . I feel his fingers move to press against my pulse . This small adjustment touches me deeply . I do not know the name of his specialty , but I have figured out this much : This doctor has been with countless people in their darkest hour . I sensed it in his waiting room , and now I know . His specialty is disorders of the eye that lead to total blindness . He is the kind of eye doctor my grandfather was , who appears at the moment the patient is falling off the edge of the sighted world . He puts himself between the patient and that terrifying fall . The only way I can keep from hysteria is to put a familiar , loving face on this stranger . I envision him as a younger version of my grandfather . " Jackie , " he says . " I know this is hard . And it will get harder . But I believe that , in time , it will get better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a respectful space for private prayers . My father has taken my other hand . He clears his throat . " Doctor , how much vision will she lose in her other eye ? " He wants percentages , just like Kenny . " At the moment , it 's difficult to say due to the clouding effect of the medication , " the specialist answers . " That blurriness should clear up within an hour . However , the left optic nerve is swelling rapidly , so any recovery of vision will be temporary . " " How temporary ? How much time will I have ? " But I already know the only answer . However much seeing time I have left , it will never be enough . ON THE DRIVE HOME , I KEEP MY LEFT EYE fixed on my father . I want his face to be what I see when the drops wear off . But it is Kenny 's face I see first . He is opening the car door . I have to look straight at him-my sight is telescopic now-but I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , but stare at the food . Then I stare at the faces around the table . I ca n't stop looking . Later , I memorize Kelsey 's profile , watching her sleep , breathing in the sight of her like oxygen , never quite getting my fill . Suddenly , I crave all the pictures of my life . I am frantic to find them . I gather all the framed photos from the desk and tabletops , all the albums and loose photos in drawers , even old school yearbooks from the shelves . I spread these out on the floor in a close circle around me . As I crouch over these piles of pictures , I am comforted . Kenny and Dad have pleaded with me to go to sleep early . But how could I close my eyes as long as I can still see something with them ? Kenny joins me in the living room , kneeling down and pulling me into his arms . But I pull back so that I can hold his face and study it . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He closes his eyes , but does not turn away . He would never turn away from me . I fell in love with him 18 years ago , my first year in college . Kenny is the luckiest thing that ever happened to me . Up until these last few days , I have always felt lucky . I knew I was born lucky simply because I was n't born like Robin . All my life , I have been riding the crest of good fortune , but now the tide has turned against me . I let go of Kenny 's face to look down at the picture that has fallen in my lap-an old family photo of my three sisters and me and Robin , together on some special holiday . It 's a color snapshot , and I look carefully at my brother 's eyes . Robin 's real name was Arthur , but we always called him by his nickname , because his eyes were the exact shade of robins ' eggs . But they are not blue in this photo anymore . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lost all the colors now . I hold the picture so close to my face that my nose skims its surface . I close my eyes . I do n't want to look anymore . I do n't want to watch my family vanish into a cloud . " Kenny , I 'm tired now . Please , help me to bed . " Kenny pulls up the covers and sits next to me . He strokes my face . I can feel his body shaking beside me , but I ca n't cry with him because then I would have to open my eyes to release the tears . And I need to keep my eyes shut tight so that I wo n't see his disappearing face . I WAKE UP TO THE SMELL OF BACON cooking . My father must be making breakfast , just as he did every Saturday morning of my childhood . I can hear the sound of footsteps coming down the hall . I sit up and fall sideways and down , right off the bed . I 'm lying face down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet . I roll over on my back . Jake is licking my face . I open my eyes , but I ca n't see the dog , only feel the softness of his fur against my skin . I look down at where my legs should be , touch my knees , hug them to my body . I am invisible to myself . I can smell , hear , and touch , but I ca n't see . I have woken up blind . I crawl toward the bed and reach for the end of the bedspread , but my hand grabs air . I fall down again . " Help , " I cry out . Kenny and Kelsey come running into the room , calling out to me . " Mommy , why are you keeping your eyes shut so tight ? " Kelsey asks . " Oh , Kelsey , " I say , reaching for her . " I love you so much . " " I love you , too , Mommy . " I feel her breath against my face , her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she wants me to wake up . But I ca n't open my eyes , even for her . I ca n't bear losing the sight of her . " Mommy , are you sick ? " " No , " Kenny says . " Mommy 's not really sick . She 's having trouble with her eyes , but the rest of her is fine . " He hesitates over the words . He has no idea how to tell her . Neither do I. This is not in any of our parenting books . " Will Mommy 's eyes get better again ? " Kelsey asks . I do n't know what we should tell her . The specialist believes that I will see again . Maybe not as well as before , but better than nothing . Better than now . Still , I 'm afraid to believe it , and afraid not to . Kenny clears his throat , and to my surprise , says , " I called the doctor this morning while Mommy was still asleep , and I asked him that same question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I ask at the same time . " He said Mommy 's eyes would start to get better in eight to ten weeks . " I gasp . This is a miracle ! He did n't just get a number-he got a date ! It 's now the middle of March . By the first of May , I might be able to see again . Two months-hardly any time at all . " Kenny ? " " Yes , Honey ? " " Tell me his exact words . Please . " " He said if it is going to get better , it will start to get better by then . " " If ? If ? So there 's a chance it wo n't ? " " Jackie , please . Do n't go there . " " But I am there , Kenny ! " My voice is rising , and I do n't want Kelsey to witness my distress . I do n't want to pull her down with me . I do n't want to bring Kenny down either . They 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of me . " Kenny , please take Kelsey out of here . " " Mommy does n't feel well , Sweetheart , " Kenny tells Kelsey . " I 'm going to take you to your grandfather . " " I love you , Mommy . I hope you feel better soon . " Kelsey 's hand is patting my back gently , and then it is gone . I 'm shaking all over now , chilled to the bone . I hear Kenny 's footsteps returning . " Jackie , we are going to get through this . We are . " He gets under the covers and holds me , his chest to my backinstant warmth . " Oh , Jackie , " is all he says . THE NEXT MORNING , KENNY IS SITTING ON the bed , gently shaking my shoulder . I do n't want to open my eyes . I 've heard the morning sounds : Kenny 's shower , the blow-dryer , a ringing phone , Kelsey 's good-bye as she left for preschool . I listened without opening my eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jackie , I know you 're awake , " Kenny says . I turn and look in the direction of his voice . I blink at the gray space where he must be . My head snaps back against the emptiness . I shut my eyes again . I need a mask that will weigh down my eyelids so they wo n't open out of habit or hope . " Listen , " Kenny says , " the phone has been ringing off the hook . Your sisters , your friends , everybody wants to know how they can help . " " Tell them there is n't anything they can do . " He takes a deep breath . " Jackie , we need a plan . I 've got to go back to work . Somebody has to be here with you and Kelsey . " " Teresa can stay full-time and help with Kelsey . " " I 'm talking about help for you . " " I do n't need help . I 'm not leaving this room until I 'm ready . And I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come visit . " " No . " This is the one thing I am sure about . " I do n't want anybody to see me when I ca n't see them . " " Even your sisters ? They 're ready to fly out here . " " Kenny , tell them not to come . Tell them I 'll telephone them . " An idea occurs to me . " Please buy a phone with big raised numbers . " " All right . I 'll go to the store right now . " He is excited . " I 'll get you books on tape , too , and a tape recorder , one you can dictate into if there 's something you want to remember . " He 's ahead of me . I ca n't read or write , but I can speak and hear . " Jackie , we 'll figure out a way for you to do everything . But even so , it 's only temporary . " " Do you really believe that , Kenny ? " I have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do , " he says firmly . " I ca n't explain why I 'm so sure , but I am . " I know why . It 's because he loves me too much to allow himself any doubt . " Kenny ' ' ? When you get back from the store , would you take me to the sink and put out my toothpaste and stuff ? " " Of course . But you do n't have to wait . I can do that now , or I can call Teresa . " " I 'll wait for you to help me , " I say in a small voice . The greatness of my needs hits me in the stomach . Everything is so hard . As Kenny leaves , the dog jumps on the bed . I give in to tears , releasing huge , gasping sobs . I cry for my brother , my mother , for every person who has ever been sick and felt this alone . The dog leans against me and licks my tears . Jake is a retriever-husky mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is deaf and almost blind with old age . What a pair we make . I throw my arms around him and cry into his fur . OVER THE NEXT TEN DAYS , I STAKE OUT the territory of my home , counting and remembering steps . I feel as though I am in a fight , tired all the time , trying to storm my way out of this dark place . Then there 's the emotional rollercoaster that has me screaming inside , crying and laughing in inappropriate moments , yelling at the dog , cutting off Kelsey mid-sentence with some biting remark . do n't recognize myself . I spend much of my time with a phone in one hand and a radio in the other , flipping switches , alternating between taped and live voices . I call my father , who has returned to Baltimore , and my sisters . I report that the specialist remains confident that my sight will return , but so far there is no sign of improvement . Kenny has told me that , night after night , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on positive thoughts , to guide the imagery of my approaching sleep toward a future full of hope , but I am stuck looking backward , at my brother and the past . In my sleep , old pictures resurface , and I have the full spectrum of colors restored to me . This view of my childhood comes at a terrible prices but I do not wish to give it back . I cling to these dreams . IN MY FAMILY , EVERYONE HAS ALWAYS had their assigned role . Polly , the oldest girl , is the questioner . She tries to get at answers by finding the right questions . The classic middle child , I am the mediator , looking at both sides of every issue . The third girl , Sally , is the listener , letting other people talk until they 've figured out their problems on their own . Mary Clark , the fourth and youngest sister , is the cleanup batter . She takes a huge swing at a problem and almost always hits it out of the park . Now , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone wires talking to one another , trying to come up with a strategy to pull me through . Sally is a psychologist . Dreams and thoughts are the currency of her trade . So she is the sister I tell first about my dreams of Robin . " What kind of dreams ? " Her voice deepens to its professional baritone . " Mostly happy childhood memories . " " Happy ones ? Are you sure ? And they are about Robin and you ' ' ? " She rapid-fires these questions at me , not waiting for an answer . " Do you want to know what I think ? " " Yes . " I not only want to know what she thinks , but I want to think the way she does . I want to share her sunnier view of everything . " All right then , " she says . " You are at a very low point . It 's natural for you to reflect upon every other sad memory in your life . But it 's comforting thoughts you need now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration . " " How do I do that ? " " Well , each time a sad image comes to you , visualize sweeping it away , replacing it with a happier picture . " " Sally , we 've been doing that as a family for years . But do n't you ever wonder what happens to the other pictures . Where do they go ' ' ? " " You do n't have to worry about that now . ' " But that 's all I worry about-everything that 's been hidden and covered up . It 's come back to me now for a reason . I have to believe this . " " I think we 're going around in circles here , " she says . I can hear her little boy calling for her in the background . " Listen , I can hear this is a had time . I 'll call you tomorrow , all right ' ' ? " I hang up and dial the next number . " Polly , do you remember when Robin was beaten up by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , Jackie , there were so many times that he was hurt . I 'm not sure I recall that particular incident . " I tell Polly what I remember . It was October 1973 , and I had just met Kenny . I was home for the weekend . It was a sparkling fall afternoon , and I was in the kitchen , looking out the window , thinking how perfect everything was-an 18year-old girl in love . I heard knocking at the door . It was our neighbors ' son . He told me that my brother had been " roughed up " by a pack of kids . They 'd thrown things at Robin , called him names , then knocked him down and kicked him in the head . " Jackie , " Polly said . " It 's hard for me to picture Robin 's face without some kind of bruise or cut . All those years that he was in the mental hospital , he would be beaten up all the time , usually in a struggle over his things-his camera or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I always thought that out in the real world and on his visits home , he would be more protected . " " But , of course , he had even less protection on the outside . That 's why Mom agreed to admit him to Rosewood . " " But he was so big and strong , " Polly says . " Why did n't he ever fight back ? " We are both silent , thinking about this . It 's true that he was tall and not physically disabled , but his mental handicap showed in his posture and in his eyes . He was an easy target for cruel children . " I 've had a difficult time remembering him without his head being hurt in some way too , " I confess . " But recently , in my dreams , it 's been easier to see happier pictures . I 've been seeing Robin in a different light . He looks peaceful . His presence brings me a kind of stillness , as if he is trying to comfort me . " Speaking these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto . It 's been II years since Robin died . He had built a life for himself in the years after he had been discharged from the mental hospital . He was on his way to work from a group home when he was hit by a car . Polly , a lawyer then , handled everything . She reviewed the accident report and spoke to witnesses . They all saw it the same way : A young man , anxious to catch a bus , ran into the street into oncoming traffic . He never looked for cars . He was pronounced dead at the scene , in the crosswalk of one of Baltimore 's busiest intersections . " Polly , " I say in a quiet voice . " When I can see again , I want to look through the bag he was carrying that day . I do n't know what I 'd be looking for-I just want to see his things . " " Oh , Jackie , I 've never found the strength to do that . When your sight gets better , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he 's trying to tell you . " My sister Mary Clark has always been a genius in math . She 's now a bank executive , who talks as fast as she computes , stringing sentences together like long-division calculations . " Mom comes to me in dreams , " she tells me when she calls , having already spoken to Sally and Polly . " She gives me advice . " " Really ? You never told me this before . " " Well , there did n't seem to be a reason . " Some things never change-we need permission to talk about the most important things in our family . " Anyway , I agree that Robin is trying to tell you something by appearing in your dreams , " Mary Clark says . " I think he 's telling you to be brave , to hold on , you 're going to make it through this . You 're on your way to that old light at- " " I know , " I rush in to finish her sentence . " That old light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that is the headlight of the approaching train . " She laughs . " Now that we have solved your problem , please put my favorite person on the phone . I want to know if she got the book I sent her . " I call out for Kelsey and put the receiver down as soon as I hear her voice chirping away to my sister . I lie back in bed . I try to summon happy images . I remember Robin and me , side by side , as children , down in Virginia , on a vacation visit to our grandparents . I remember the colors of that summer , the dark yellow of a piece of jagged glass that Robin used for finding crabs in the murky water , the blue of the tips of their claws , all the ivory and brown shades of our tanned hands , holding crab nets and fishing rods . With all my heart I wish there were more happy pictures of my brother to summon . I had so many plans for making up to him all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we took without him . The last time I saw him , I told him I was moving to California . We talked about how I would buy him a ticket to Los Angeles , and we would go to Disneyland together-his lifelong dream . He died before I moved , and the first time I went to Disneyland , I could feel him beside me , riding all the rides , shaking hands with his favorite cartoon characters , in life-size versions . I seize on these pictures that were never taken and rescue them from oblivion , if only to prize them in my blind dreams . May 22 , 1991 In our house , the living areas are upstairs , to take advantage of our ocean view . The bedrooms are on the lower level . I must climb the stairs-five steps to the middle landing , nine more to the top-for my first cup of coffee of the day . A few weeks ago , Kenny stopped bringing my coffee downstairs . He did n't have to tell me why , although he mumbled something about missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive , he reads the newspaper to me . I do n't mind this routine ; I 've been getting up earlier anyway , so that I will have more daylight time to look for blue-the color that would be restored to me first , according to the specialist . It 's been ten and a half weeks since my gray fog descended , beyond the range the doctor had forecasted . " It could take longer , " he said . " But I still believe your sight will improve , although you should n't expect a dramatic moment . It will be subtle . That 's why you must concentrate on looking carefully . " I reach the top of the stairs and stand for a moment , looking ahead to the picture window . Still nothing . I hear Kenny , rustling the paper , and reach for the counter to guide me the seven steps to the table . My hand hits something . It slides across the tiles . There is a loud crash . " Please , do n't leave anything at the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap for me . " " Good morning , " Kenny says . " What did I break ? " " A little clay something that Kelsey made for you in school . " " Oh , no . " " It 's all right , " Kenny says . I hear him get up . " Stay there , Jackie . I do n't want you to cut your feet . I 'm coming over to clean it up . " Then , when I least expect it , lift my head to my husband 's voice and the grayness moves . " Kenny ! " I shout . The gray shape gets larger and takes on a blue tone as it moves closer toward me . " What ? " he screams . " Did you hurt yourself ? " " Kenny-I think I can see you ! " He grabs me and pulls me into his arms , but I pull back . I want to see more . " Kenny what are you wearing ? " " That blue bathrobe you gave me years ago . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Move around ! Let me see you move , Kenny ! " I am shouting . " Mommy , Daddy , what 's going on ? " Kelsey ! I want to see her-the shape of her moving . I hear Kenny whispering to her . " But Daddy , I 've been wearing that blue dress every day since you bought it for me-it 's in the dirty clothes bag now . " " Go get it ! " Kenny and I call out at the same time , and then collapse into laughter . Finally , together , laughing out loud . I have Kenny dial the doctor . When he gets on the line and I announce my news , he tells me he 's delighted . He reminds me that he had assured me my vision would get better and it did . " So even great doctors indulge in I-told-you-sos , " I say , and he laughs . It may take months before I have any functional vision , he cautions , and that 's going to be hard . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 I can see all the colors now . It took me over a year to get them back , with Kelsey 's help . We went to places where I could feast my eyes on colorart museums , fabric stores , flower nurseries . My favorite discovery was the tropical-fish stores , where I could watch colors swim before my hungry eyes like tantalizing morsels of food . Always the store clerks would ask if we wanted to buy something . " Just looking , " Kelsey would say , smiling . In September 1993 , 1 had a second child , Benjamin . At 18 months old , he bears a startling resemblance to Robin at that age , with bright blue eyes and a cloud of blond curls . But the difference is that Benjamin , like Kelsey , has already learned how to look . Some children never learn to look , and they turn into adults who can not see the most important things in their world . It takes an early loss-something that had always been there and was supposed to be there forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , unexpectedly , for this loss to be imprinted on a child 's mind . For me , it was my brother , taken away in the darkness , right before my eyes . I woke up the next morning and went looking for him , and every morning afterwards . I cried for my brother from that day forward , and even now I cry for him , as much for the sadness of his life as for the sadness of his death . But grief is a cleansing force . Love washes through all the pain , like sunlight through clear water . * <p>
