On Friday evening , March 1 , an advance guard of six Kuwaiti Cabinet ministers arrived home to reclaim control of their nation . The news was all bad . The oil-well fires were worse than expected , food and medicine were in short supply , water and electricity were memories . But the prime topic of conversation that night was the " Skip problem . " <P> The " Skip " in question was Edward ( " Skip " ) Gnehm Jr. , 46 , the U.S. ambassador to Kuwait . The " problem " was really a fear . Many Kuwaitis were afraid that the U.S. , after having freed their country from Iraq 's domination , aimed to run the place as an American colony and that Skip Gnehm was George Bush 's designated proconsul . <P> There never was a real problem , of course . The Kuwaitis themselves have been running the show all along ( with disastrous consequences ) . " Skip is an adviser , a facilitator , " says Ali Salem , a Kuwaiti resistance leader who stayed behind when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the government 's own incompetence that has made them wary of someone who knows what he 's doing . The fact is , we would probably be in better shape today if we had made Gnehm proconsul . " <P> A native of Georgia whose two great-grandfathers fought on different sides during the Civil War , Gnehm has a reputation for navigating successfully through difficult straits . In the wake of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war , when relations between the U.S. and Syria were restored , it was Gnehm who ran the U.S. interests section in Damascus . When Washington wanted a presence in Riyadh , the Saudi Arabian capital , Gnehm was selected . When the sensitive issue of reflagging Kuwaiti oil tankers arose during the Iran-Iraq war , Gnehm was a key negotiator . " He is unassuming and unflappable , " says Ali al- Khalifa al-Sabah , Kuwait 's Finance Minister , " exactly the kind of guy to deal with Arabs like us . " <P> As ambassador to a government without a country , Gnehm found his diplomatic skills tested almost daily at the Sheraton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership waited out the occupation . Tempers frayed , decisions were postponed , depression was common . A real crisis arose when Iraq started dumping Kuwaiti oil into the gulf in January . The Saudis and Kuwaitis argued over what to do . It took 48 hours of patient haggling , but Gnehm finally got both sides to agree : U.S. bombers would blast Al-Ahmadi oil facility 's manifolds to stem the flow . Gnehm 's best trick was getting Kuwait 's Oil Minister to believe the idea had been his all along . <P> These days , it is more of the same . It is Gnehm who has prodded the government into revamping its food-distribution system ; Gnehm who watches over the American troops trying hard to minimize Kuwaiti retaliation against those who collaborated with the Iraqis ; and Gnehm who has insisted that the government 's ministers cease promising the imminent return of services , something they are weeks if not months away from accomplishing . In a particularly significant triumph shortly before he welcomed home Kuwait 's Emir last Thursday , Gnehm persuaded the electrical-repair teams to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting in eight-hour days . " Imagine , " says another Western diplomat , " Kuwait is falling apart , and something that obvious has to be counted as a diplomatic coup . "
