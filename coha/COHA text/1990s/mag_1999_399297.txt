Section : Technology Digital Tools <p> CELLULAR PHONES MAY BE THE MOST ANNOYING , undependable consumer products this side of PCs . Proof ? The oft-uttered phrase : " Are you on a cell phone ? " Yet we ca n't imagine life without them . <p> Now they are ready to add the Internet  --  or some portion of it  --  to your pocket . That is the basic idea behind the new services Sprint PCS touts as the " Wireless Web . " <p> Sprint is n't the first cellular carrier to offer data phones , and it wo n't be the last . But for the moment it 's the only carrier whose offering covers its entire service network . Sprint 's new Web phones reach a special subset of the Internet , cut down to size for tiny devices . To get a taste of the Web writ small , I tried several Sprint phones ; a flipless little phone-on-a-stick from Sanyo ended up being my favorite . <p> The pocket phones all carry built-in minibrowsers from Phone.com that can access specially formatted Web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloomberg . Push a button , connect to the mini-Web , scroll through menus  --  and news , sports , stock quotes and even Yahoo 's mail , calendar and address book appear on your screen ( albeit sometimes after a considerable delay ) . You can even reply to messages or change your calendar . <p> Since current phones have teeny screens , they deliver only 5 to 30 words at a time . The job of presenting information in small spaces will remain a black art . For example , since many screens can show only two words across , Yahoo 's cell site formats its news headlines as individual lines that blink successive phrases when you select them ; CNN keeps headlines shorter but eats precious screen space . <p> Sprint 's new phones , like many others already in existence , can also deliver short messages that announce their arrival the way pagers do . People can send mini e-mail to you directly ; the phone has its own address . You can also set up a Yahoo account to send the first 100 characters of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times a day . But this service is one-way only . To answer incoming messages from Sprint 's phones , you have to go on-line with the minibrowser and , for now , use a Yahoo account  --  which can not yet be set up to pluck mail from your main e-mail account and zap it to your phone . <p> What 's behind this is some potent alphabet soup . HDML ( Handheld Device Markup Language ) , which Sprint is using for now , is a precursor to a newer Web standard called WML ( Wireless Markup Language ) , better known by the initials WAP ( Wireless Application Protocol ) . Both are designed to help content providers format sites so that they 'll look good  --  or at least comprehensible  --  on tiny screens . <p> Must a site whose business plan involves delivering eyeballs to flashy banner ads consider cellular data a loss leader ? Not forever . The first time you call it up on a Sprint phone , weather.com shows you this : " Notice : To continue to provide this to users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' messages along with forecast information . By clicking ' agree ' you acknowledge that you agree to these terms and will not see this message again . " So far , no ads have arrived , but sooner or later they will  --  presumably on your dime . <p> Most of Sprint 's new data-capable phones work at a poky but serviceable 14.4 kilobits per second . But none of their data features will work when you roam outside Sprint 's network . With a connection kit that includes special software and a serial cable , priced at an exorbitant $200 ( better deals should be available ) , you can use your Web phone as a wireless modem for your laptop . <p> Sprint already has competition in this market . AT &T's; PocketNet has offered limited Web-browsing functions for several years now only on special analog phones . It will soon be available on new dual-mode models that can work with digital or analog networks . PocketNet uses the CDPD ( Cellular Digital Packet Data ) system in the analog spectrum , runs at about 10 kilobits per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pricing for wireless data is all over the map . PocketNet costs a flat $30 a month for pseudo-Web access directly from a cell phone , but use that phone as a PC modem and you 'll get whacked a whopping extra nickel per kilobyte . Sprint 's plans include special data packages you can add to voice plans , along with deals that pool data and voice time . <p> Either way , data minutes end up costing about twice as much as voice for no apparent reason . In Seattle , Sprint offers 500 " anytime " minutes for $50 ; 50 extra data minutes , plus 50 short inbound messages , cost $10 . A package of 300 minutes that can be used for voice or data runs $60 and includes 200 short messages free . Luckily , if you do n't use the Web connection for a minute or so , you get disconnected ; when you reconnect , you usually pick up where you left off . <p> As in all things cellular , phone design is key , and that is where Sanyo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when the bright blue backlight is off . It could access the data network even when some of the others could n't , and a four-way key for navigation makes working with the on-screen menu system relatively easy . A red light on top flashes when you have incoming voice or text messages . <p> With the serial data cable , the $180 unit served well as a 14.4-kilobit modem . At a claimed 3 hours of talk time and 120 of standby time , it has plenty of juice , and a light , compact battery charger goes with it . Its only major drawback is found in most cell phones : There is no way to use the computer cable to transfer data to and from its phone book . ( A $40 program called FoneSync from U.K.-based Paragon Software promises to remedy that for most phones , but the version for the ones reviewed here was n't ready for testing . ) <p> Denso 's $200 Sprint Touchpoint is very similar , right down to the software , but somewhat bigger , adding two extra lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanyo , it was consistently good at making data connections . But in a crucial interface gaffe , it omits the Sanyo 's handy " end " key , making it take forever to back up through multilevel menus . <p> The screen on Samsung 's $150 SCH-3500 is bigger than the Sanyo 's but displays less information at once , and its navigation buttons can be maddening . But cute features abound , including the ability to dial phone numbers via voice recognition and store and capture short voice notes . <p> Qualcomm 's $100 QCP-1960 does n't have a headphone jack , and it ca n't roam on analog systems ( though a slightly more expensive model can ) . Its screen is nearly as big as the Touchpoint 's , but its big , blocky characters put it dead last in the information-per-screen ratio . The screen and interface design would doom it for Web access even if it did a great job making Web connections , but this model had trouble linking up even when phones right beside it worked fine . <p> Most promising  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heaviest of the bunch but compensates for that by providing a screen that can display ten lines of data , plus one for the menu . But it too lacks a headphone jack and often had trouble making data connections . The rated talk time of 150 minutes is okay , but the 40-hour standby time is not . And the phone does n't have an analog mode ( a forthcoming model will ) . Those problems are serious in a $400 phone , and so are rookie mistakes like a navigation key that does n't repeat when you hold it down . And just try to figure out how its voice-command system is supposed to work . <p> The Neopoint does include Sprint 's otherwise pricey software and cable , which enable the best part of this phone : Its ability to sync its built-in calendar and address book with the one on your computer  --  if it 's in Act , Outlook or Lotus Organizer . As with most synchronization programs , there are easy ways for this one to make mistakes ; sure enough , it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information transferred accurately . Nice touch : The phone can display your next appointment on its default screen . <p> The Neopoint 's other winning feature is its T9 text-input software . Other Sprint phones make you type letters in by using the keypad : Press the " 2 " key once for A , twice for B , thrice for C. You can get the hang of it pretty quickly , but entering successive letters on the same key is vexing . <p> With T9 , developed by Tegic Communications , you press each key just once . Each time you enter a new letter , the system guesses the word  --  which can change radically at each press . It sounds impossible , but for simple messages it works brilliantly , though of course you have to turn it off to enter URLs . This software is in several other phones ; in the data era , it should be in all of them . But I 'm still trying to figure out how to enter a carriage return in any of the data entry systems ; with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long they might be . <p> As usual in high tech , there 's no need to rush to buy a Web-enabled phone . Other cellular providers will bring out their WAP-based products soon  --  I saw several clever phones from Ericsson and Nokia at Comdex in mid-November  --  and users may find Sprint 's planned upgrade from HDML to WAP not quite as seamless as promised . Delays and error messages suggested that some company servers are already overloaded . <p> And carriers will likely compete not just on price , but on features . Benjamin Linder , Phone.com 's vice president of marketing , says , " You 're going to see a lot more transactional applications " like banking and stock trading ; Sprint has a deal with Ameritrade . And as phones get smarter about knowing where you are , you may see services based on your location . <p> Just wait : One day your phone will display an ad inviting you to stop by the Radio Shack up ahead and upgrade it . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Neopoint NP 1000 : Big screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Qualcomm QCP-1960 Thin Phone : barely Web-worthy . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Sprint PCS Touchpoint : menu " simplicity " taken a bit too far . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Samsung SCH-3500 : cute features , meager display . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Stephen Manes <p> THE CONCEPT OF THE QUALCOMM pdQ is simple : It 's a cell phone with a Palm organizer built in . But it has none of the sleekness that makes the Palm V and many new phones so attractive ; this big , clunky thing looks as if it were designed for the military . It does n't quite fit the hand , it ca n't revert to analog , and the flattish stylus seems flimsy . And it costs $800 . <p> The screen 's top part is devoted solely to phone functions ; it 's visible even when you close the flip , whose buttons are on the outside . When you open it , you uncover a Palm screen about two-thirds the size of a standard model . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-fisted product in a one-handed world . Other phones let you do almost everything with one thumb ; here you often have to pick up the stylus and poke the screen . <p> The dialer is linked to the address book , but the integration between phone and organizer seems haphazard . When a data call dies , using the on-screen " redial " button only replays the last voice call . Sprint 's other phones come ready to collect voice mail at the touch of a button . The pdQ I tried did not ; the manual did n't say how to make it work . <p> You 'd think something this big would have great battery life . This one is rated for 2n hours of talk but only 40 hours of standby . It will be visiting its cradle often . <p> But this phone can do things others ca n't : Surf the real Web ( or at least the text-based part of it ) and collect e-mail from standard accounts without benefit of wires . That 's because it does n't know from WAP ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaves like a 19.6-kilobit modem hooked up to the Web . It serves as a modem while connected to a PC . <p> The Internet-standard PO mail software is decent ; it downloads only part of each message , so you can dispose of it without wasting time . Like any Palm organizer , the pdQ can also collect mail from a PC via the cradle . <p> The browser is less successful . Its design is confusing : It lacks standard navigation features like " back " and " stop " buttons and tends to want to deliver pages you 've already seen rather than fresh ones . It ca n't do Web graphics but does display their text labels , so the pages it delivers often are poorly formatted . <p> Other cellular vendors have licensed the Palm OS for future products . More phones will no doubt exchange data with computer-based calendars and address books . This one may have special corporate uses . But so far , the wedding of Palm and phone , which at first seemed a wonderful marriage of convenience , looks more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLOR ) : Qualcomm pdQ : It 's a shotgun wedding of the PalmPilot and a cell phone . <p> BY Stephen Manes <p> BY Stephen Manes <p> <p> Stephen Manes ( steve@cranky.com ) is the cohost of Digital Duo , a weekly public television series .
