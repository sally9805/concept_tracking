Sculptor Richard Hunt 's highly acclaimed work is thoroughly modernist , but it pulses with the power of nature  --  and city life <p> In the Carter G. Woodson Regional Library , on Chicago 's South Side , there is an extraordinary work of sculpture . It is called Jacob 's Ladder and consists of three main elements , which occupy the space of a 27-foot-high atrium , with a skylight overhead ( p. 62 ) . Suspended from the rafter level beneath the skylight are two giant welded-bronze " arms " reaching down toward the floor . Each has a pair of great claws at its end . One pair holds a slight , somewhat twisted ladder . The other is empty , claws open . <p> On the floor beneath those reaching arms is an assemblage of bronze plates so arranged as to suggest several things relevant to the title : a primitive altar in the desert ; the flame from such an altar ; the future patriarch himself , rising from sleep at the heavenly visitation ; even , in the upward slant of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of the Tower of Babel . What all of these readings of the work have in common is the attempt at a link between earth and heaven , humans and God . <p> But Jacob 's Ladder also has contemporary significance . Set in a library used mostly by blacks , staffed by black librarians and located on the predominantly black South Side , Jacob 's Ladder , the creation of a local black artist , Richard Hunt , is also an obvious metaphor for the learning that makes you free . The books , the library , literature itself , a facility with language and all the opportunities that open on the ladder of learning , all are implied strongly in this piece of sculpture in this place at this time . <p> In addition to which , there is a Negro spiritual called " Jacob 's Ladder " ( " every rung goes higher higher " ) that is very much a part of the black heritage . <p> Yet this is not really a " message piece . " The formal values are striking , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the building . <p> Hunt 's use of bronze as a shaped , rather than molded , material , welded together rather than cast in one piece , combines that most ancient of materials and a modern mode of creating three-dimensional art . In Jacob 's Ladder that combination carries an extra value : the angelic ladder of learning brings the timeless wisdom of the ages to bear on contemporary life ; it opens the measureless past of humanity to humanity 's latest members . <p> It is this kind of unobtrusive consciousness of the past working on the present that , over the past decade and a half , has made Richard Hunt the outstanding artist of public sculpture in Chicago , the Midwest and points south . <p> There was a time when it seemed that every European cultural institution had to have a large emblematic work by Alexander Calder , and every American cultural institution had to have the same by Henry Moore . In 1979 the National Gallery of Art in Washington opened its new East Building with one of each . That retired the cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now occupies the Calder-Moore position in Chicago . His large works appear in front of or inside libraries , community centers , universities , even apartment houses and office buildings . Among such patrons are the University of Illinois at Chicago ; the University of Chicago ; the lakefront apartment house at 900 North Lake Shore Drive , a Mies van der Rohe work ; and the new , stripped-down , so to speak , corporate headquarters of Playboy Enterprises . <p> As of mid-1990 there are 30 or more such works around what the Chicago Tribune proprietarily calls " Chicagoland , " and at least that many elsewhere in the Midwest and in the South . And still counting . <p> The secret of Hunt 's institutional and individual popularity seems clear enough . He has made himself , or found himself to be , a bridge between the basic idiom of contemporary sculptural abstraction and the expectations of many people that art will say something about something other than art . Hunt 's work is undeniably abstract and contemporary . Yet , it teems with suggestions , meanings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject engages him , Hunt can do art about art , although it will turn out different from work that often enough in the art world self-consciously sets out to deal with art . Consider the piece for the apartment house at 900 North Lake Shore Drive ( above ) . <p> The title is Fox Box Hybrid . It stands on a pillar that is part of the work , the whole about ten feet high in Corten steel , naturally rusted . lt could be a bird , gazing out on the inland sea of Lake Michigan , but it really is n't . It is n't a fox , either , but you can see the suggestions of the vulpine : narrow nose , bushy tail , a certain delicacy , a svelte form in motion . The box is easier , though that is n't there , literally , either . But there are boxy edges and planes all over those graceful sweeps . Hunt describes his use of different sources as a hybridizing process . " The problem of my sculpture , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume , as well as implications of image and emotion . " <p> Richard Hunt , the man who combines image and emotion in solid sculpture , is solid himself : about six feet tall , built like a football guard or a Michelangelo statue . The solid build is appropriate to the work , which takes heavy lifting and heavy hammering , as well as skillful manipulation of some of the most sophisticated and dangerous tools in modern light industry . He cuts , he burns , he beats the metal , and after that he treats it with acid . He often refers to his wall pieces as drawings in space . <p> The face above the solid figure is evenly featured and dark brown in color . The eyes are a liquid brown , the tightly curled hair grizzled gray . <p> He is one of the few Chicagoans completely , residentially , as a neighbor , at home in two separate areas of the city . His studio is farther up than the fashionable Near North Side in what has come to be called " the Mid-North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought the studio and now lives there again with his invalid mother . But he was born in the deep Depression year of 1935 and brought up on the South Side , then Chicago 's black belt . The South Side is still largely populated by blacks , though now much of it has been turned into high-rise-housing slums . <p> Hunt 's mother , a librarian , gave him the gift of books , then as now the Jacob 's ladder up from poverty . She also gave him the gift of music . Hunt says she was a " frustrated musician " herself and therefore wanted to get her son into music one way or another . She also took him to performances by local black opera companies , which sang classical repertoire , Mozart , Rossini , Verdi and Hunt 's favorite , George Frideric Handel . He studied the violin for years , thoroughly enjoyed it , and rehearsed in the South Side 's Abraham Lincoln Community Center . <p> He had been drawing for as long as he could remember , taking art classes at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did music . In high school he came to the conclusion that his talent for art was much stronger . Even so , the melody lingers on in many ways . In his studio , for one . The air is always discreetly filled with classical music in the background . Politics in the family barbershop <p> Hunt received an early grounding in politics as well as in music and art . In the 1940s he was the factotum in the family barbershop , sweeping up the shorn hair and also serving as shoeshine boy . Those were still the years of almost total segregation . For Hunt the great thing about the barbershop was that he heard black men talking politics there : local politics , state politics , national politics and global politics . Hunt was already forming political opinions . <p> Hunt 's studio is the dream of any contemporary sculptor working metal in large scale . It was an electrical substation generating power for light-rail surface transportation-trolley lines . The brick building , with huge windows and a full-length skylight , was built to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move them as occasion required . That meant that , when Hunt acquired the building in 1971 , a full-sized crane , its tracks and the load-bearing support system for them were already in place . The main floor , concrete , is 40 feet from the ceiling . <p> With torches and anvils , a shaping table , hammers and mallets , metal snips and cutting wheels , Hunt and two assistants work through what seems an endless stream of bronze and steel sheets that arrive flat and depart formed , shaped , buffed and burnished works of sculptural art . " Artists no longer must imitate nature , " says Hunt , " but are free to interpret it . Sometimes I try to develop forms nature might create if only heat and steel were available to her . " <p> The principal work in hand not long ago was a three-piece ensemble of welded bronze towers called Eagle Columns ( pp. 68 , 69 ) . It consists of three pillars fabricated of sheet bronze , one 25 feet high , the others 12 and 15 , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , a form that suggests an eagle in flight or on the alert , watching and waiting . The work was one of the most elaborate to come from the shop . It did n't have far to go , across the street and across a one-block-square city park , where it now stands . <p> Hunt is very conscious that he works in a neighborhood once lived in by John Peter Altgeld , the liberal governor of Illinois in the 1890s . Altgeld pardoned three of the anarchists convicted of inciting violence during the Haymarket " riot , " and he denounced President Grover Cleveland 's armed federal intervention in the Pullman strike . For these actions and his general pro-labor position , he failed to win reelection . Vachel Lindsay , in a long poem about Altgeld , called him " the Eagle Forgotten . " Hence Hunt 's title . <p> The old powerhouse is n't Hunt 's only workplace . Increasingly he has been a customer of the Bert Jensen &; Sons metal fabricators factory in Racine , Wisconsin , a lakefront city distinguished architecturally by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for an earlier Wright " Prairie House " overlooking the lake . <p> Working in two places about an hour and a half apart , Hunt is of two minds about his two ways of work . His assistants in the former power station are recent art school graduates , currently one from Hunt 's own alma mater , the Art Institute , the other from the no less distinguished Institute of Art in Cleveland . They understand readily what it is Hunt wants to do in a particular piece but , through lack of experience , they do not always understand how to get from the idea to the reality . <p> Technical expertise is basic to the craftsmen Hunt works with in Racine . He likes asking them to do something and having it done , and also telling them what he wants to do and having them tell him how to do it . Hunt 's ideal assistant is a worker who understands sculpture as something different from one more job of metal fabrication . <p> " At this point in my career , " Hunt says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public sculpture is the further development of my own ability to synthesize more complex sculptural ideas with production techniques more easily comprehended by a broad band of professionals , artisans and workers in the metal trades . " <p> Hunt himself was quite a remarkable art school graduate . To graduate with a " real degree , " and to placate his worried parents , he enrolled for a Bachelor of Art Education degree , a ticket for teaching in Illinois public schools  --  just in case , as parental prudence put it , the world did not beat a path to his studio door . <p> In the 1950s , that meant that he also had to study non-art subjects at " real " colleges . He attended night classes at both the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Chicago . To help pay his tuition he worked in the zoology laboratory at Chicago and for a moment seriously considered biological science as a career . The moment passed . <p> At the Art Institute of Chicago he racked up scholarships as well as museum prizes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year he graduated , the Palmer Prize ( as in Mrs. Potter Palmer and the famous Palmer House Hotel ) and the James Nelson Raymond Foreign Travel Fellowship . <p> That last gave him a year in England , France , Italy and Spain . British sculpture was booming in the late ' 5Os , with a lot more to it than Henry Moore , Barbara Hepworth and the very late Jacob Epstein . It all interested Hunt , and in Spain there was Julio Gonzalez , a clear and present influence . <p> At the same time as these and other honors , the world did indeed begin to beat a path to his door . The first path-beater was Charles Alan , of the recently formed Alan Gallery in New York , a spin-off of Edith Halpert 's now-legendary Downtown Gallery . <p> In Chicago one day , in 1955 , Alan saw Hunt 's work , bought a piece of his and signed him up as a gallery regular with the promise of a one-man show . <p> The other part of the world to beat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself arriving in San Antonio 's Fort Sam Houston in December of 1958 , just about the time his first New York show was opening at the Alan Gallery . The Army pegged him for imminent relocation to Germany . <p> In an Army service club near-beer bar , Hunt struck up a conversation with a sergeant who turned out to be an Army artist about to be discharged . The sergeant took Hunt to meet his commanding officer , who was delighted to have an impending problem solved . Papers went back and forth , and Hunt became an official Army artist . <p> Art in that part of the Army was graphic design for recruiting posters , signs and charts . Hunt knew lettering , but he winged it for most of the time . While in the Army , he worked part time in a local art studio . Having found that Uncle Sam was amenable , Hunt eventually signed on for a course back at the Art Institute school in Chicago and got a discharge three months early . Back home , he taught for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song of New York drew him for a time . While he was there tentatively looking for studio space , however , Hunt was told by his friend Richard Stankiewicz , the earliest of the " junk sculptors " to command attention , that it was important to have space on the second floor or higher : that way , you got a warning when city inspectors arrived , and had time to hide your torches and other illegal equipment . There went New York . Later , Southern California proved tempting too , but finally , not for Hunt . " I 'm a Midwesterner , " he says . " I drive a big station wagon . I do n't mind it . " <p> But if he became , ineluctably , an artist in Chicago , he eventually decided to stop being a " Chicago " artist . Though he has often shown works " by invitation " in regional exhibitions since the early 1960s , he has rarely applied to them . Encouraged by good sales by Charles Alan , he also decided that he would live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receiving grants . Characteristically , he had a Guggenheim fellowship in 1962-63 , but declined to apply for the all but automatic renewal . <p> Hunt married a classmate shortly after graduating from the Art Institute in 1957 . The marriage ended in divorce nine years later , in part , Hunt thinks , because his wife , also an artist , saw herself as a mother who was unfulfilled professionally . There was one child , Cecilia , named for the patron saint of music . Now 27 , Cecilia Hunt lives in Chicago and works with fabric and jewelry , making " art to wear . " <p> Shortly after the divorce Hunt received his first commission for a large outside piece . Soon after that the chance at the old trolley car powerhouse came along and he grabbed it . <p> One unexpected dividend of the building started 12 or 13 years ago . Every year since then , Hunt has brought in friends who are musicians to develop musical presentations and perform for the pleasure of other friends and neighbors . The programs range from early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world premiere of a concerto for two violins and chamber orchestra by T. J. Anderson , the longtime head of the music department at Tufts University , outside of Boston . The program included two other such concertos by Vivaldi and Bach . Musicians and audiences have been surprised to find the acoustics so good . Thomas Wikman , conductor of Chicago 's Music of the Baroque Orchestra and Chorus , says that the proportions of the studio are almost exactly those of the Thomaskirche in Leipzig , where Bach spent the greater part of his career . <p> T. J. Anderson is involved in another extrasculptural project of Hunt 's . A mutual friend is Leon Forrest , novelist and professor of African-American studies at Northwestern University in nearby Evanston , Illinois . The three have known one another for years . A couple of years ago , they began getting together for taped conversations , which they hope one day to publish as a book on the general theme of making one 's way as a black artist in the overwhelmingly white world of the arts in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black artist as a special being began as he was returning from an art world cocktail party in the early 1960s . " I suddenly saw that artists are like Negroes  --  as we were then called  --  in many ways . People really believe the artist is better off without any money , " he says , " as whites believe Negroes are happier that way . Like most artists , most Negroes do not succeed in the larger world . Inner-city blacks drop out of school at rates similar to the rates at which art school graduates drop out of art . That was a moment of illumination . I 've never forgotten it . " Visiting professor , near and far <p> One result of that epiphany and of subsequent experiences that reinforced its meaning has been the ongoing conversations with Anderson and Forrest . Hunt 's determination to shape his career could be based in part on this realization . <p> Although Hunt did not want to be a full-time art teacher , he has nevertheless accepted invitations to serve as artist-in-residence or as visiting professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ivy to Big Ten . <p> In 1983 , Hunt remarried . His bride was Lenora Cartright , quite as distinguished in her own world as Hunt was in his . It seemed to many an ideal marriage , and may well have been one . A black woman who started upward at the special schools of the University of Chicago , Lenora became a dean at the University of Illinois , a city official under mayors Jane Byrne and Harold Washington , as well as a consultant on human affairs and community relations to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese and to such commercial firms as Revlon and Sara Lee . In 1989 , with appalling abruptness , Lenora died of cancer of the liver . <p> One of the things Richard Hunt admires about Handel is the composer 's ability to cope with whatever fate threw at him . When , for example , the British public tired of the elaborateness of Italian opera , Handel reinvented the oratorio and in the process created a sizable and significant part of the literature . When one of those as-yet-inexplicable and awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from grief by plunging deeply into his professional practice . Simultaneously , he organized her memorial service  --  Handel , Bach , appropriate speakers in the Roman Catholic Holy Name Cathedral  --  as well as a living memorial to her , the Lenora Cartright-Hunt ( United Negro College Fund ) Chicago Student Emergency Fund , the institutionalized version of what he 'd been saying in Jacob 's Ladder . <p> In September 1989 , Hunt installed Freedmen 's Column at Howard University ; it is a major work that alludes to Gen. Oliver Howard , founder of the university . Howard was the first director of the Freedmen 's Bureau , established for black Americans newly freed after the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 . From Howard , in Washington , D.C. , Hunt went to Harvard University to begin a full academic year as artist-in-residence . He is now preparing to do a short-term residency at Kalamazoo College in Michigan , where he will also create a commissioned work for the campus . <p> At some point , Hunt would like to divide his time between making large works in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones in the studio , works he could usually handle alone or with a single assistant . During the past ten years , the demand for large public pieces has taken him away from smaller work , and he misses it . <p> Hunt 's place in late 20th-century American sculpture seems assured and important . At this time , thanks in part to the sponsorship of the National Endowment for the Arts , public sculpture has become a matter of giving the artist the opportunity to work on a large scale and to express whatever it is he wants to express . There are those who think this will lead to an epochal advance over the Civil War generals who still dominate streets and parks all over America and especially in the nation 's capital ; all were honored works in previous days . It is an advance , often , although at least two of those generals in Washington are among the country 's absolute top works of sculpture : the Grant Memorial by Henry Shrady and the Phil Sheridan in midride by Gutzon Borglum . <p> Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michelangelo onward the expression of the artist 's own thoughts of self was managed very well within the framework of serving a public purpose . Artists working within those limits did n't do all that badly . Hunt has restored that tradition in the language of sculpture of his time . That 's no small achievement . <p> He 's done something else , too . Some of his most important works refer to or come out of the black experience in America . It could hardly be otherwise . In works such as I Have Been to the Mountain , a memorial to Martin Luther King jr. , in Memphis , where that leader was killed , or Freedmen 's Column at Howard University , Hunt himself acts as a bridge between the black reality in America and the essentially European , white reality embodied in the very idea of the public sculpture he is part of . <p> In this Hunt is also part of a new tradition that embraces Jacob Lawrence and Romare Bearden , Langston Hughes and James Baldwin , and the inspired Negro Ensemble theater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The author of 24 books about art and artists , Frank Getlein has written for SMITHSONIAN on Erastus Salisbury Field and Edward Landseer . <p>
