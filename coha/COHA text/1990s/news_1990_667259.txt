<p> " As soon as Sonny Liston died , something went to work in me . I knew I was the baddest guy . The death of Sonny Liston meant the reign of George Foreman . " <p> HOUSTON - Seems incongruous that the artificially sweetened ' 90s version of lovable , huggable George Foreman once idolized Charles " Sonny " Liston , the scourge of boxing and perceived as one of the sport 's all-time meanies . <p> Liston was viewed as a sullen ex-convict and onetime mob goon . His ring gaze was penetrating , his knockouts frightening . The illiterate son of an Arkansas sharecropper became one of boxing 's most feared and respected world heavyweight champions , despite two suspicious knockout losses to Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali . <p> Twenty years ago next Sunday , Liston died in his Las Vegas home of heart failure . An autopsy revealed needle marks in his right arm . Police found heroin and marijuana in his home . He was 38 . Foreman , then 21 , was stunned . <p> " He used to lecture me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sparred with Liston in 1969 and modeled his temperament after him . " He was ultra-conservative , more than people realize . They had him all wrong . He was sensitive . He was hurt by people more than you know . " <p> In the ' 70s , Foreman 's passion was trashing people , in the ring and out . A street dude with a street attitude . As Liston did before him and Mike Tyson after , Foreman transferred childhood rejection into a ring fury that attracted fans , then repulsed them . Ali entertained ; they executed . <p> Foreman revealed the depth of his anger in a recent interview with USA TODAY when he confided that during his heyday he was consumed with one chilling thought : " I wanted to kill someone in the ring . " <p> In Foreman 's frosty eyes and frozen heart , all it would 've taken to satisfy his blood lust was " just one guy . " <p> " Take his life , not even think of him as human . Then I knew I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a fight , I would think , ' Maybe this is gon na be the lucky one . ' When I looked him in the eye , I was really sizing him up as a trophy , like a deer hunter . You know , something to hang on the wall . <p> " Some guys were saying , ' I can stop Foreman , ' but I knew I could stop them from thinking that by killing one of them . <p> " I wanted to destroy those guys . I wanted to create a machine that could destroy anything . " <p> Outside the ring , his rage was Texas-big , his temper legendary . Adrienne Foreman , the first of five Mrs. Foremans , remembers his mother admonishing her , " Always watch his eyes " to gauge when Mount Foreman was about to erupt . <p> " The white part , " Adrienne says , " would turn red . " <p> Foreman manhandled people 's feelings in much the same manner he bludgeoned opponents . He roughed up women . He spurned camp members , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the championship to Ali in 1973 in Africa , 19 months after annihilating Joe Frazier with six knockdowns en route to a second-round KO in Jamaica . <p> " I had no heart for people . I did n't care , " Foreman says . <p> Today , he is Everybody 's Teddy Bear . He chats with blue-collars and blue bloods alike . He preaches the Gospel . He kisses babies . He gobbles food for the cameras . He wolfs down money from eager promoters . He spits out overmatched stiffs . He jokes . We laugh . He laughs . He is boxing 's 260-pound town clown headed straight for the bank with a $ 12.5 million payday against champion Evander Holyfield April 19 in Atlantic City . <p> " I 'm going to eat hamburgers and cheeseburgers and belly-bop that little guy all over the place . " <p> You can hear the chuckles , and the money jingling , from the Carolinas to California . <p> Foreman 's new , self-deprecating appeal is selling . He pokes fun at himself , mostly at his protruding belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - it works . About the smallest things he consumes are 10-second sound bites . TV talking heads love him : late night , early morning , cable , pay-per- view , you name it . Foreman 's forced grin through clenched teeth is plastered in living rooms from coast to coast . <p> He leads the anthem for " fortysomething " couch potatoes everywhere . When Big George lumbers into the ring draped in terry-cloth robe , he looks more like your balding neighbor who just tumbled out of bed than a menacing threat to life and limb . The common-man approach and the mystique of the big puncher has won him new fans while rekindling nostalgia . The clamor - he 's 24-0 with 23 knockouts since his comeback in 1987 - has led to his first title fight in 16 1/2 years . <p> With shaved skull and a peaceful , almost meditating prefight ring demeanor , Foreman more resembles a plodding Buddha than the paid assassin he secretly desired to become when , in his prime , he was boxing 's chairman of violence , its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensely private and suspicious , Foreman gets by quite nicely these days on guile , wisdom , careful planning and a thudding punch . <p> " I would n't want my kids to meet that guy , " says Foreman , who traded a bad attitude for the Bible and became a preacher after he lost to Jimmy Young and retired in 1977 . " You know how you look at a Doberman pinscher and get on the other side of the street ? That 's the kind of attitude people gave me - ' Get outta the way of that . ' " My attitude wore me down . Now it 's ' Here comes George , ' and it 's a joke . Nobody 's serious . " <p> As a teen , he was a mean-spirited kid from Houston 's bloody Fifth Ward district . Quit school in ninth grade . Drank wine , fought and mugged . Joined the Jobs Corps at 16 and discovered boxing . <p> " I did n't want anyone to challenge me , " he says . " I 'd whip you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respect me , fear me . The people I admired were the ones you feared . I wanted that kind of fear . I had no potential to be anything . " <p> He has come a long way . In his third boxing life , Foreman has choreographed every move of his championship march while offering a laissez- faire pose . A close friend says , " No matter what he 's doing , he 's in control . " <p> In private , he can be dominating . And he 's very old-fashioned when it comes to women . <p> " When I was pregnant ( with their daughter ) , he said , ' That is my baby , you 're just growing it for me , ' " Adrienne says . <p> He is described by those who know him as bullheaded . Adrienne praises him as a devoted father and remains an admiring , if wary , confidante . " I 've got to stay friends with this guy . He 's one of those people you 'd rather have as your friend . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touchy . " <p> On the surface , the reborn Foreman - some say repackaged - bears no semblance to the glowering , churlish , anti-social creature of yesteryear . Promoter Loren Cassina says the new-look Foreman is old-hat veneer . <p> " There 's not an ounce of difference in him . He does n't have a good bone in his body , " he says . " He 's too ' cute . ' He surrounds himself with dishonesty , and if something goes wrong , he plays the , ' Ah , shucks , honest-as- apple-pie American boy . ' " <p> Foreman became a national hero when he waved that tiny U.S. flag after winning a gold medal in the 1968 Olympics at Mexico City but alienated himself from much of black America that supported the symbolic , militant black-power salutes of Olympians John Carlos and Tommy Smith . <p> A political animal Foreman was n't , or is n't . He was a follower . A Liston wanna-be . <p> " I wanted to pattern myself after this fellow , " he says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion of the world , I figured it would do the same for me . I wanted to be that kind of a champion . " <p> These days , Foreman seems a gentle sort , though he stretches his believability when he insists , " I never get mad . " He does n't bother trotting out the intimidating prefight stony stare he perfected from Liston . Like many things he does , it 's done purposefully . " I never look in their faces no more , " he says . " I would prefer them to think , ' Maybe he 's scared . ' " <p> Foreman has learned to be a practical fellow , too . The last thing Ol ' George wants is a younger , lighter , defensive-minded guy scooting about the ring as he tries to corner him and club him into next week with those hammering sequoias disguised as forearms . He wants a willing , if not particularly able , dance partner . Better for Foreman that they think they can wipe up the canvas with the old man 's trunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : GEORGE FOREMAN : Ex-champ returns
