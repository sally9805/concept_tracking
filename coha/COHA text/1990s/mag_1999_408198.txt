// PULL UP A STUMP , SIT beside any well-used trail , then check out hikers ' footwear for a while . You 'll soon notice that boots fall into one of three categories : 1 ) heavyweight , heavy-duty , over-the-ankle leather boots , otherwise known as waffle-stompers ; 2 ) low-cut , superlight , mostly fabric shoes often referred to as " trail tennies " ; and 3 ) the in-betweens , the not-too-light , not-too-heavy models that a majority of the backpacking public wears on the trail . It 's this midweight category that accounts for most of the boot sales these days , and for good reason ; these boots are sturdy enough to provide a decent amount of ankle support , yet light enough so that you do n't feel las though you 've got a cinder block strapped to each foot . When we decided to find out how the latest crop of midweights stands up to the rigors of the trail , the number of potential candidates was daunting . We had some winnowing to do , so we established backpacker-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 ounces or less per pair ( men 's size 9 ) according to the manufacturer $200 or less waterproof mid- or high-cut for ankle support recommended for three- to seven-day hikes under 25 to 50 pound loads available in men 's and women 's sizes We wound up with seven pairs ; five are allleather . During five rigorous months , eight testers hiked more than 2,400 total miles through terrain ranging from the slickrock canyons of southern Utah to the mudflats of northern Wisconsin to the snowfields on Washington 's Mt . Rainier . Because fit is such a personal thing , boot testers sometimes have wildly differing opinions on comfort . Before you decide on the boot that is right for you , peruse the tester profiles ( " Meet The Feet " on page 78 ) and decide which tester 's feet most closely match yours . Then pay particular attention to that person 's comments in the individual reviews that follow ( presented in order of overall performance ) . Also , take note of the " Fit Tendencies " column in the chart located on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned the highest honors for one simple reason : excellent support . Steve echoed the group consensus : " If you want to bash around the steep stuff while wearing a heavy load , these are your boots . " Because of the sturdiness ( a result of the burly full-grain leather , heavyduty construction , and a stiff midsole ) , break-in took a bit longer than usual , but everyone liked the results . " Although extremely supportive , " wrote Liz , " these boots do n't baby your feet with cushioning . The comfort comes after a long day 's hike when you realize the boots , rather than your feet , absorbed the abuse . " Waterproofness was another strong suit , thanks to the one-piece leather construction and high bellows tongue . Dan 's experience was common : " Walking for an hour up a cold , melt-water stream in Oregon 's Wallowas , these boots not only kept my feet dry , but also warm . " The Broncos received the highest waterproof rating in the test , but do n't have a waterproof/breathable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that well-constructed , welltreated boots can keep out moisture . As for durability , the Broncos also took the prize . After a rigorous , multiday hike into the Grand Canyon , Annette concluded that , " The Grand Canyon eats boots like few places on Earth , and the Broncos came out with little more than a few bite marks . " Bottom line : Paul summed it up best : " a boot made to take you places . " If you want a lot of boot for a little weight , and your terrain of choice is rough and rowdy , the Garmont Broncos wo n't disappoint you . Asolo e The Asolo Quartz boots ended up near the top of the heap because they are , as Liz and Kat put it , " as comfortable as sneakers . " No other boot came as close to fitting all eight testers . Breaking in the Asolos , which are made of splitgrain leather with a touch of Cordura , was pain-free for everyone but David , who developed " several painful hot spots on both ankle bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David became the Asolos ' biggest fan . ) The Gore-Tex liner proved it could effectively block water , even when Steve hiked through too many " narrows in Utah where I was in and out of the water constantly , " and when Dan forgot his fishing waders on a trip into Idaho 's Sawtooths . Photograph GARMONT BRONCO PLUS ASOLO QUARTZ Photograph // Although not as stiff as the Garmonts , most testers agreed that the Asolos provide ample support for a three- to seven-day backpacking trip . " They 're fairly cushy and well-padded , " said Steve . Kat noted , " As my body fatigued and my steps became more careless , my feet and ankles were well protected . " The Vibram sole gave good traction for the " gloppy mud " Eric encountered along Wisconsin 's Lagoo Creek , the " miles of jagged and loose rock " that Liz found in Greece , the " soft , mushy snow " Dan ascended on Mt . Rainier , and the " slick cedar logs " David encountered . Bottom line : The easy-to-fit Asolo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather and abuse , and grips every type of terrain known to North America . Salomon - Adventure 8 : Testers had high praise for the Salomon X-Adventure 8 , a full-grain leather boot that sports a higher than average ankle shaft and a unique plastic instep panel that successfully " snugs your foot in place to minimize movement , " as Kat noted . Six of eight testers praised the boots ' considerable rocker ( the lengthwise curvature of the sole ) that , said David , " puts spring in my every step . " Paul , however , found the rocker annoying because it interfered with his stride . Salomon 's Contagrip sole provided excellent traction thanks to the grippy rubber and deep lugs . They kept Eric " surefooted on a muddy , slippery day in Wisconsin 's Rainbow Lake Wilderness . " Although testers appreciated the easy one-pull lacing system , three of them described near stumbles when bent upper lace hooks hung up on each other in midstep . This , as well as a bit of wear on the outsole , caused some concern in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // A few other minor complaints : the plastic instep panels " squeak with every step " ( Liz ) , and " the sole is wide and clunky , making this boot best suited for trail travel and not bushwhacking " ( Steve ) . Bottom line : A well-cushioned , snug-fitting boot made for racking up serious trail miles . Best for weak-ankled hikers who want extra support . Raichle Mountain Legend GTX : The Raichle Mountain Legend GTX was a solid performer , yet widely varying ratings kept it in the middle of the pack . One thing everyone liked was the " nofrills " construction , which made the Mountain Legend the lightest and nimblest boot in the test . " If my hiking route takes me onto talus or other dicey terrain where I need solid footing and a boot that lets me respond quickly , " wrote David , " these are the boots I 'd pick . " The soft , Nubuk leather makes the Mountain Legends easy to break in . " Prior to a weeklong trip to Wind Cave and Badlands National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got was a walk through the airport , " confessed Annette . " Still , I did n't get a single hot spot . " But testers disagreed on the amount of support the boot offers . Steve called the Legends " a good bet for heavy packs and rough country , " while Eric felt they lacked ankle support and sole rigidity , proclaiming them " okay for moderate loads on moderate trails . " Testers liked the lace hook on the center ot the tongue , which " keeps the tongue from migrating " ( Dan ) . The Legends boast a Gore-Tex liner that along with the high tongue gussets , did a good job of keeping out water for most testers . But Liz reported a " slight leak along the seam of the tongue during a creek crossing , " and David complained that they were saturated after a day of snow hiking in the North Cascades . Other points to note : The Vibram sole kept everyone upright through mud , clay , talus , snow , and your average crumbly dirt . But Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Columbia . " The crew generally felt the Raichles are well made and durable , even though both Dan and Paul noticed some delamination of the toe bumper . Photograph SALOMON X-ADVENTURE 8 RAICHLE MOUNTAIN LEGEND GTX // Meet The Feet // Bottom line : The trim-fitting Mountain Legends are fine choices for three to four days on the trail , but you 'll want more support for longer trips . Tecnica Finder : The first thing you notice about the Tecnica Finders is the look . Instead of traditional leather and Cordura , Tecnica uses cutting-edge fabrics-Keprotec , a tough synthetic material , and Crosta leather , which is rubber impregnated-for optimum breathability and durability with minimal weight . Annette appreciated how well the tough Crosta leather toe protected her from rocky footholds in Canyonlands National Park . " I also liked the Tecnicas ' padded ankle tops , " she noted . " They lace snugly around my skinny leg without gapping . " The other testers concurred about the toe protection and ankle comfort , but because of the softness of the ankle padding , most everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectrum , and best suited for " no more than midsize loads on moderate terrain , " as Eric put it . Waterproofing scores were what really affected this boot 's overall rating . " The biggest problem stems from the fact that the tongue gusset ends about 2 inches from the top of the boot , " said Dan . " Even when I crossed shallow creeks near Washington 's Granite Peak , water poured in under the laces , " reported Kat . On the plus side , the Finders dry quickly . One last feature worth noting is the unique , speed-lacing system . " Excellent , " " a no-brainer , " " outstanding , " and " friction-free " were some of the terms used to describe these well-shaped , rugged little pieces of hardware that make lacing a breeze . Bottom line : A comfortable , lightweight boot with a quick break-in time . Best for dry trips with few stream crossings and loads of 40 pounds or less . Merrell Grand Traverse GTX : Though a strong contender in some categories , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had three testers ( Kat , Annette , and Paul ) hobbling with blisters . Almost everyone complained of a lack of volume and width in the forefoot , yet the heel pocket was " wide and unrelenting , " as Annette noticed . Waterproofness was deemed superior , thanks to the Gore-Tex liner and fully gusseted tongue . Liz dubbed the Traverse " as waterproof as a submarine " after sloshing though numerous creeks throughout northwestern Oregon , then up and down a slushy Mt . St. Helens . The high , well-padded , full-grain leather uppers offered all-around support . Dan said , " The best in the bunch for support . With the semirigid sole and strong upper , the Merrells are completely cushioned , stable chambers for my feet . " Photograph TECNICA FINDER MERRELL GRAND TRAVERSE GT : // A few details concerned testers , however . First , there was the " bulky , unruly tongue , " as Kat described it . Added Eric , " It 's lumpy , it pinched me , and it often took a while to get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laces often came undone . " These laces tested my knot-tying ability , " Paul said . Two other testers also complained that the upper lace hooks bent , which they were able to fix with pliers , but feared the hooks might eventually snap off . Bottom line : If it fits you , the Merrell Grand Traverse is a rough-and-tumble boot that will serve well on rugged , multiday trips . This boot excels in wet terrain , and should do well for people with narrow , low-volume feet and iron-clad heels . Danner St. Helens : Breaking-in the Danners was easy because , as Eric noted , the leather is " like butter . " And the Vibram soles provided testers with great traction . " Not wet rock , nor mud , nor sand were a match for these soles , " Dan said after a long weekend on Washington 's Olympic Peninsula . But no-break-in time comes with a down side , and in this case it 's the boots ' overall support . Eric called them " too supple . " Steve pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group felt that the soft leather would n't hold up . " After two weeks of wear , these boots looked like tired trail veterans , " Liz commented . In the waterproof department , the St. Helens proved adequate , as long as the boot tongue was perfectly positioned beneath the laces . As soon as it slipped to one side , the bellows drooped and water snuck in . The soft leather also tended to soak up water faster than other boots in the test . Bottom line : The Danner St. Helens are decent boots for dayhikers , folks with strong ankles , or those who like their boots on the soft side . If you 're a fan of rough terrain and heavy loads , consider one of Danner 's heavier-weight models . Photograph DANNER ST . HELENS Sidebar It had been a cold , wet six-day trip into Wyoming 's Wind Rivers . When I finally reached the warmth of the car , I ripped off my muddy , saturated boots and socks , wrapped them tightly in a plastic bag , and put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give those boots another thought until I came across a stinky plastic bag in my garage a month later . Inside were the boots , covered in mold and mildew and ruined . Do n't make the same mistake I did . Take care of your boots and they 'll take care of you . Here 's how : 1 . Let boots air dry , preferably out of direct sunlight . To hasten the process with thoroughly saturated boots , remove the insoles and laces , open the boots as wide as possible , and stuff newspaper inside to absorb moisture . 2 . Never place wet boots close to a heat source , such as a heater or a fire . The leather can contract , rendering your boots a half-size too small or splitting them : Rubber soles have also been known to melt . 3 . Brush off dirt with a stiff nylon shoe brush . For obstinate dirt and salt stains , rinse with clean water , then brush . 4 . Use an old toothbrush to remove muck from nooks and crannies. 5 . Sprinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the leather starts to look dry and light-colored , moisturize your boots to prevent cracks . Consult the boot 's manufacturer for the recommended treatment . 7 . Use chrome polish to remove rust from boot hardware . 8 . Once your boots are dry , clean , rejuvenated , and ready for your next adventure , store them in a cool , dry , dark place . -K .
