<p> Almost as soon as he accepted a job as president of Dunlop Sports , David A. Haggerty got a call from two old friends at Sports Authority , the national mega-outlet for sporting goods . " They said , ' Hi , welcome aboard ; just want to tell you we ca n't carry Dunlop tennis racquets anymore ; the brand just does n't sell , ' " Mr. Haggerty recalled . <p> Mr. Haggerty flew to Sports Authority 's headquarters in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , and talked them into keeping at least a few Dunlop racquets . But it was a sobering experience . <p> " Apparently , Dunlop had become this your-father's-Oldsmobile type of company , " Mr. Haggerty said . " Our product stacked up fine , but we had a real image problem . " <p> That was almost three years ago , and , to cadge from yet another consumer products ad , Dunlop has come a long way , baby . Tennis players are snapping up superlong racquets , which Dunlop was the first to sell in 1995 . Professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's products . And joint marketing deals with companies like Reebok , Thor-Lo and Perrier are putting Dunlop in well-regarded company . <p> Dunlop 's recovery in tennis gear has been much faster than the sport 's slow return to popularity . As such , it is both a case study for any company that is tempted to blame external forces for its problems and a primer on how to stretch a lean marketing budget far enough to restore the gloss to a dimming brand . <p> Dunlop 's numbers reflect its resurgence . In 1994 , when Mr. Haggerty signed on , Dunlop lost about $2 million on $12.4 million in tennis-related sales in the United States . ( Golf equipment , which the company sells under the Maxfli and Dunlop brands , is a $75 million business that has held its own . ) Last year , Dunlop earned about $5 million on $25.2 million in tennis equipment sales , and Mr. Haggerty has promised his British bosses  --  Dunlop Slazenger International Ltd. , a private company , owns Dunlop Sports , which is based in Greenville , S.C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn of the century . <p> Those sales are coming out of competitors ' hides . Two years ago , industry executives say , Dunlop accounted for barely 6 percent of the sales of racquets and balls . Last year , it commanded 12 percent of the $200 million wholesale market , and more than 21 percent of the market for extra-long racquets , those an inch or two longer than standard 27-inch racquets and that are said to provide a powerful serve . <p> Long racquets sell at the high end of the spectrum , which runs from as low as $20 for a child 's racquet to $300 for some highly engineered , weight-balanced models . ( Dunlop 's prices top out at $200 . ) <p> Dunlop is unlikely to unseat Prince or Wilson Sporting Goods , which together control about 75 percent of the market . But it is breathing down Head 's neck for third place , and it is keeping Yonex , Spalding and other rivals at bay . <p> " Dunlop is back as a recognizable player , " said Philip Perrella , co-owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fla . <p> Dunlop 's problems , of course , are far from over . Its brand still lacks pizazz . Until recently , John McEnroe , who left the tennis circuit five years ago , was the only professional endorsing Dunlop racquets . ( " Which was great , " Mr. Haggerty quipped , " if we wanted to be the official racquet of retired tennis players . " ) Its long racquet is already widely copied , and Dunlop has no other major products in the pipeline . <p> Some stores already report dwindling Dunlop sales . " Dunlop 's sales are again starting to recede , so they 'd better continue innovating , " Mr. Perrella warned . <p> Mr. Haggerty knows that Dunlop 's window of opportunity may be small . A tennis pro turned businessman , he joined Prince in 1980 when it was a distant third to Wilson and Head . By the time he left in 1993 , he was a senior vice president who had helped Prince ride what he calls its " better mousetrap , " the oversize racquet , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wide-bodied racquets toppled Prince a few years later . And now Wilson , which is owned by the Finnish company Amer , may do the same to Dunlop 's long racquet . Its new Sledgehammer Outerlimits , a 29-inch racquet with a 135-square-inch head , is the biggest racquet permitted by International Tennis Federation guidelines . <p> " In tennis , the product is the driving force , and even a great brand name will carry you just so far , " Jim Baugh , president of Chicago-based Wilson , said . <p> Indeed , ever since the late 1970 's , when new graphite composites made possible racquets with a range of attributes that wood never allowed , racquet makers have tinkered with shapes , weights and designs that provide more power or accuracy . Since modern tennis racquets rarely give out , they realized that the only way to get players to buy new ones was to persuade them that the new racquets would improve their play . <p> That , of course , is part science and part salesmanship . So although Dunlop is spending about $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concentrating even harder on buffing up Dunlop 's image . <p> He has tripled the annual advertising budget for tennis equipment to $650,000 and will spend about $3 million this year on free equipment and promotional materials for teaching pros , who he hopes will talk up Dunlop products . Dunlop now has some 800 pros promoting its racquets and balls at clubs and specialty shops , and Mr. Haggerty has set his sights on 1,000  --  not many compared with the 5,600 in Wilson 's stable , but quite an improvement over the meager 200 promoting Dunlop in 1994 . <p> " If I get our story to the trade , they 'll carry it to the customer , " Mr. Haggerty , 39 , said during a tennis-plus-conversation afternoon in his hometown of Princeton , N.J. ( And yes , he has one heck of a serve . ) <p> Now Mr. Haggerty needs to make sure customers do not look blankly  --  or worse , snort with derision  --  when that tale is told . Dunlop 's internet home page ( www.dunlopsports.com ) is rife with jazzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Wayne Ferreira , the world 's 10th-ranked male tennis player , and Mr. Philippoussis , whose 137 mile-an-hour serve is the fastest on record , as Dunlop endorsers . <p> " If pros are playing with a Dunlop racquet , you 'll feel better playing with one , " Mr. Haggerty said . <p> For similar reasons , Dunlop is piggybacking its image onto more prestigious names . It is chipping in with Perrier to put spring water-and-tennis-ball vending machines into tennis clubs , and Mr. Haggerty is talking to BMW about a joint promotion aimed at women , the details of which are still being ironed out . <p> Reebok International and Thor-Lo , whose sales representatives generally concentrate on mass retail outlets , have given Dunlop 's sales force the exclusive right to sell their respective shoes and socks to tennis specialty stores . " It 's an old cliche , but together we are stronger than any one of us alone , " said James L. Throneburg , Thor-Lo 's chairman . <p> The three companies do not tread on one another 's product toes  --  something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparel , can say . " Joint sales forces only make sense when there are no overlapping products , " said Phil Parrish , who manages Reebok 's sales of tennis and running shoes . <p> Mr. Haggerty may have good timing as well as good partners . Tennis is nowhere near its peak of 35 million American players in 1978 , but , thanks partly to racquets that make it easy for even aging baby boomers to play powerful tennis , it is coming back from its nadir of 13.5 million players in 1985 . " Tennis is finally regaining its popularity , " said Brad Patterson , the Tennis Industry Association 's president , who estimates that some 19.5 million people hit the courts last year . <p> Moreover , sales of cheap racquets  --  those under $50  --  are rising , which historically has indicated that more children and first-time players are taking up the sport . <p> And while Wilson remains a formidable competitor , Prince has been foundering since the Italian clothing company Benetton Group bought it in 1990 . Benetton spent lavishly on ads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it cut Prince 's sales force by a third and pulled back on research . <p> In the absence of new Prince racquets or visits from Prince salespeople , many tennis shops gave Prince 's " peg " space  --  the wall space on which racquets are displayed  --  to Wilson and Dunlop . Tennis industry executives say Prince has in the last few years gone from about 45 percent of the market to 30 percent  --  effectively changing places with Wilson , until 1994 a distant No. 2 . <p> Even before his days at Prince , Mr. Haggerty has always kept one foot planted in the game , the other in the business . He went to George Washington University on a tennis scholarship , majored in marketing  --  and made extra money stringing racquets for his teammates . After graduating in 1979 he played professional tennis in Europe  --  and , as he bluntly put it , recognized he was not good enough to make a living on the pro circuit . " I had talent , but others had a lot more talent , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach tennis at a club in Hamilton , N.J. One morning , one of his students , a Prince executive , suggested he apply for a job . " I did n't want to be presumptuous , so I waited until after lunch to call , " Mr. Haggerty recalled . <p> He has no illusions about toppling Wilson , or even overtaking Prince . He knows that his challenges are more fundamental . <p> " People who care what others think still are embarrassed to walk onto a court with a Dunlop racquet , " he said . " If they get over that , most of our battle will be won . " <p> Chart : " A Return to Form " In the late 1970 's and early 1980 's , Dunlop Sports was among the top makers of tennis equipement , with high profile players endorsing its products . Gradually , though , the company 's standing slipped as Dunlop failed to keep up with innovations by competitors . Now Dunlop is fighting back , led by its first signficant innovation in years ; a longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kazdan/The New York Times ) 1980 Market share rank : 3 Tennis equipement sales : $23.2 million Through the 1970 's , most Dunlop racquets were made of wood . They were endorsed by John McEnroe . In 1980 , Dunlop introduced its Max line of graphite racquets . But Prince 's oversize racquets , introduced in 1976 , made it the No. 1 seller . 1991 Market share rank : Unavailable Sales : $19.5 million Dunlop introduced a racquet that reduced vibration but did not improve players ' games . Wilson 's wide-body racquet , introduced in 1988 , quickly became the industry standard . Steffi Graf was now Dunlop 's best known endorser. 1996 Market share rank : 3 Sales : $25.2 million From its nadir in 1994 , when sales of $12.4 million ranked it fifth , Dunlop rode its new longer , oversized racquets to a revival . After losing Ms. Graf to Wilson , the company signed rising stars Mark Philippoussis , and Wayne Ferreira as endorsers.
