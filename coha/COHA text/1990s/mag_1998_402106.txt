" READY ... AND ... ACTION ! " Taking his cue , San Antonio Spur Tim Duncan drives the basketball down the court . Leaping into the air like a panther , he slams the ball and dangles off the rim . He drops , frozen into a stance that says to an opponent , " Just try to get the ball past me . " " And ... cut ! " yells the director . From the way Duncan is dressed , with a black helmet , a skintight bodysuit and Ping-Pong-like balls clinging to him , you would think he was making a movie about a basketball star from outer space . Instead , he 's making a video game . The 1998 National Basketball Association Rookie of the Year was helping create " NCAA March Madness ' 99 , " a college basketball video game by EA Sports for the Sony PlayStation . Through a technology called motion capture , computer programmers can transfer Duncan 's movements onto video-game athletes . ( See page 17 . ) That makes the players look so real you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motion capture , or " mo-cap , " is just one way technology is making video games look and feel like the real thing . EA Sports invited Boys ' Life into its California studios to find out more . Smart Machines Creating a sports game is a lot different from , say , creating Sony 's adventure game " Crash Bandicoot . " Photograph Photograph // " There 's a way a sports game is supposed to happen , " says Steve Coallier , EA Sports senior software engineer . " We 're not starting from ground zero . " Still , the game has to be fast , fun and challenging . Otherwise , you might as well be playing Old Maid with your little sister . All that starts with artificial intelligence , or A.I. It lets the computer-in this case , the PlayStation-know what to do . " Good A.I. is when the video-game players behave like real players , covering who they should and knowing when to foul someone , " Mr. Coallier says . In a game like Acclaim 's " NFL Quarterback Club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's passing champ , will complete most of his throws . But if he tosses it near Ryan McNeil , watch out ! The St. Louis Ram had nine interceptions last year . And the computer knows it . A.I. even controls the " March Madness ' 99 " fans in the stands . They will get rowdy when a visiting player is shooting a free throw . But when he 's a hometown hero , the crowd will fall silent , letting him concentrate . Codemasters What makes the computer so smart ? Just as a set of instructions tells you how to set up a tent , a set of instructions , called code , tells the video-game computer what to do . " A programmer 's job is all typing , " Mr. Coallier says . " You type in a set of instructions for the computer to execute and see if it does what you told it to do . " Everything that happens during the video game is written into the code . It 's what makes the athlete perform a certain move whn vou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swish sound when your player makes a basket . A game can have thousands and thousands of lines of code , sometimes a million . Code does not just tell the computer how to make a player shoot a basket ; often , it 's simply telling it how to grab a ball . " You 're not telling a person what to do , " Mr. Coallier says . " You 're telling a machine that has no idea how to do it . " Sports Stars , Video Game Stars Good coding and artificial intelligence makes for a fun , realistic game . But without good design , you 're playing in the minor leagues . Thanks to technology like motion capture , in which real athletes suit up to become part of the video game , today 's players look more realistic than ever . Here 's how it works : An athlete wears a special suit with " markers " attached to it . ( Those were the " Ping-Pong balls " on Tim Duncan . As the athlete dunks a ball , swings a bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . Eight cameras surrounded Duncan . When those markers are videotaped , the athlete 's motion is " captured " on the computer . The videotaped motion is then transferred to a computerized " skeleton . " The result ? A 3-D athlete that looks and moves like the real thing . So when Pittsburgh Steeler Jerome Bettis runs so sweet in Sony 's " NFL Gameday " or Wayne Gretzky skates so smoothly in Midway 's " Wayne Gretzky 's 3D Hockey , " it 's because it really is Bettis running or Gretzky skating . In Your Face Designers ca n't stop with a 3-D body . The players themselves have to look like real people . Many sports games use texture mapping . That 's taking an image-a face , skin , even a school logo-and scanning it into the computer , then " pasting " it to a 3-D model . " It 's sort of like taking decals and putting them on plastic model cars , " EA Sports Art Director Tony Lupidi says . To make the fans look real , senior artist Lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans . Then he randomly inserted each group into the computerized standsover and over and over again . What 's That You Say ? With great graphics and realistic play , many gamers do n't even think about the sound in video games . Ken Felton , an EA audio specialist , says there are easily 3,000 sounds in " March Madness ' 99 , " everything from fight songs to announcer calls to beeps when you 're changing screens . And he recorded every one . When a player dribbles , for example , you 're actually hearing three or four different bounces , recorded from different positions . " If the same sound triggers every time , " Mr. Felton says , " it 's not realistic . " Real or Surreal ? Every time a programmer , artist or sound tech finishes a task , it 's loaded onto a master file until everything is perfect . Then the game is written onto a CD-ROM . Photograph // Then it 's tested . And retested . Everyone wants to make sure that the game plays well . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get better . " Within five years , " Mr. Lupidi says , " you 're going to have a lot of trouble telling the difference between a video game and a videotape .
