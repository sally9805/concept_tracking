Section : CULTURE VULTURES Lord Baden-Powell was more restrained than New Jersey . <p> So the New Jersey Supreme Court has ruled that , like restaurants , the Boy Scouts are a " public accommodation . " Curiously enough , that 's exactly how my own scoutmaster used to look on us . When bedding down in the woods , there was always a frantic scramble among his wee charges to avoid being the one who had his sleeping bag next to Akela and his wandering woggle . <p> But that was then and this is now . The New Jersey court has ruled that the Boy Scouts had no right to dismiss a chap because he was , in the modern parlance , gay . It was , in its way , a predictable decision : When even the most resilient body on the American landscape goes head to head against the gays , the gays wind up trouncing them . So with each successive St. Patrick 's Day , the annual Irish show of strength loses a little of its muscle , because of the perennial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march in the parade ? They already can , say the organizers ; they can march with the heterosexual Irish-Americans behind the banners of their home counties from the auld sod . But instead , the auld sods insist that they be allowed to march in one huge gay phalanx . In Boston , rather than accede to the queering of the green , the unreconstructed paddy homophobes wound up canceling the parade . In New York , the annual gay protest has gradually become its own St. Patrick 's Day tradition , with defiant groups of gay Gaelics taunting their fellow Celts : " We 're Irish ! We 're queer ! We 'll be here every year ! " They may well be , but others wo n't . Borough presidents , city comptrollers , and other municipal grandees whose absence from the parade would once have spelled political suicide now find it more convenient to steer clear . True , Mayor Giuliani still shows up , but then he 'll go anywhere  --  and , if necessary , in blonde wig , sequined gown , and fishnet stockings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole St. Pat 's thing a bit tame , at least compared to when he 's leading the Gay Pride parade , marching cheerily up Fifth Avenue at the head of a platoon of fawning transsexual nuns . <p> Mayor Giuliani 's not gay . Nor are most of the other mayors heading the Gay Pride marches in America . They 're just politically savvy . There are , apparently , more than 60 million Irish-Americans . So , comparing their respective political clout , how many gay Americans are there ? Sixty million ? One hundred and thirty million ? Pretty well everyone except the president ? According to polls , about 50 percent of Americans believe homosexuality is wrong " in all circumstances , " yet , despite that , the conventional wisdom says that , when it comes to gays , just get with the beat . <p> For example , just a few years ago , after an " insensitive " raid on a warehouse called the Sex Garage , the Montreal police were a byword for homophobic bigotry . But now the force has cleaned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mail ran a touching profile of two constables , Patrick Lavallee and Andre Proulx , partners on and off the job . " The two are sitting side by side in their airy duplex , and Constable Proulx 's hand is absentmindedly stroking the nape of Constable Lavallee 's neck , " wrote Ingrid Peritz : <p> " People perceive the police as very conservative , " said Constable Lavallee . " But that does n't mean the police are conservative in their private life . " <p> No , indeed . " A man appears in the living room in a skimpy black bikini . It 's Constable Sylvain Paquette , " continued Peritz , in a vivid portrait of life among the CUM cops ( that 's Communaute Urbain de Montreal , I should explain ) . <p> In such a world , there seems hardly any point in the Jersey Scouts contesting the case on the quaint grounds that homosexuality is incompatible with the organization 's injunction to be " morally straight , " as laid out by Lord Baden-Powell in his seminal tome Scouting for Boys ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy will be able to earn a Merit Badge for Camping just by turning up dressed as Mayor Giuliani . My own suggestion is that it might be easiest just to adopt the oath of Canadian Scouts , who pledge themselves to " God , Queen and Country . " <p> Ah , well . You got ta laugh , especially if you 're a scout  --  for , as Baden-Powell advised his young charges , frequent laughing helps you stay healthy . And as his Scout Law Number Eight further enjoins : " A Scout smiles and whistles under all difficulties . " Besides , on balance , I 'd wager that B-P would have fewer problems with gay scoutmasters than with the recent updating of the Boy Scouts of America handbook , in which the certainties of Scout Law Number Eight have been replaced by a bleak non-judgmental surrender to the modern world  --  " The difficulties of unwanted pregnancy can be enormous .... " Personally , I 'll stick with B-P 's Camp Fire Yarn No. 11 : " A Scout will notice people , so that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman : ' Have you seen a man with dark , overhanging eyebrows , dressed in a blue suit , going down the street ? ' he should be able to give some such answer as ' Yes . ' " I believe in the new edition the answer has been amended to : " Yes . He is an ACLU lawyer coming to sue the pants off us . " <p> Lord Baden-Powell is not the first Victorian imperialist to find his brand of muscular Christianity under siege a century later . A few years back , there was a revisionist biography of Rudyard Kipling arguing that he , like every other great historical figure , was , in fact , gay . There did n't seem to be any evidence to support this theory , but a glance at the jacket and everything fell into place : Staring up from the cover was Kipling himself  --  shaven head , big mustache , looking for all the world like he 's on his way to a leather bar in the Village . It 's useless for the poor chump to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men : We lack the imagination to do anything other than judge him by our own time . <p> So now we 're told that the Scouts are in no position to object to openly gay scoutmasters when their own founder was obviously a raving homo unable to come to terms with his sexuality . It 's true Baden-Powell was concerned about the perils of " self-abuse " among Boy Scouts and urged his scoutmasters to , as he put it , " push prudery on one side and take your boys in hand . " His sister Agnes , who headed the Girl Guides , had similar concerns : " Violent jerks and jars can ruin a girl 's interior economy " and lead to that recurring complaint of young ladies , " hairy lips . " B-P developed his theme in a sequel to Scouting for Boys called Rovering to Success ( 1922 ) , " A Book of Life-Sport for Young Men " in which the precepts of Scouting and Rovering are commended as the basis for a healthy manhood . But , in canoeing down life 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are five potential rocks on which a young chap can easily hole his boat : Horses , Wine , Women , Cuckoos , and Irreligion . <p> Horses , cuckoos , and so forth are relatively easily surmounted , but women require special attention . In the animal kingdom , B-P notes , they have something called the rutting season which leads to an awful lot of " beastliness . " " They seem to go off their heads for a time , " he explains , " running hither and thither , restless and excited , for weeks unable to settle down for food or to sleep till utterly worn out . " Unfortunately , one can witness this condition not just in animals , but also in certain types of young men , with their " pink socks , fancy ties and well-oiled hair . " The crucial difference is that for animals the rutting season comes round once a year , whereas for human beings it only crops up once a lifetime , during the transition from boyhood to manhood . It can be easily navigated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on for yourself . That would be straining and draining it out of your system . Keeping the organ cleaned and bathed in cold water every day is the best preventive . " This sounds a bit of a chore , which B-P acknowledges . " Rutting season is a very upsetting time , and it troubles some fellows to an alarming amount of depression or excitement , which often lasts for several months . " But do n't worry . After those few awkward months , it 'll all be over for life , except for an unfortunate few : " In occasional cases it goes on for a few years . " These tend to be the sort of chaps who give in to what B-P calls " Herd Bravado , " when " young fellows in the rutting stage are apt to get together to tell smutty stories and look at lewd pictures . " Instead of passing through this phase in a few fraught months and then getting on with a useful life , " many a fellow gets into the habit of immorality with women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rutting season is over and when he has grown into manhood . " <p> B-P himself thought that if he ever married it would be to " a sort of girl Peter Pan "  --  taking his cue from another now famously repressed Victorian , Sir James Barrie . If you look at the fictional exemplars of the scouting life , they too aspire to B-P 's ideal boy-girl . In The 39 Steps and John Buchan 's other thrillers , the manly types adventuring in service of the Empire approve only of women who " have the slender form of a young boy , " etc . Given that such men have the same taste in women as contemporary couturiers , we snigger and draw our own conclusions . B-P eventually married a slip of a lad called Olive . After fathering three children by Lady Baden-Powell , he took to sleeping alone on the balcony  --  in England , mind . This was n't uncommon : My wife 's grandfather , for example , early in his marriage decided to sleep alone in his old army rope bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wuss ) . <p> Such men are regarded by the massed ranks of America 's litigious gays as " repressed . " But why not take Baden-Powell at face value ? Like many chaps , he thought this bally sex rot was a lot of tosh  --  the sort of messy , sticky business a fellow should learn to do without . And so he did . He admired a lean boyish thigh as much as any of us , but it would never have occurred to him that he should spend his life sodomizing the hell out of any svelte youth who came along . He sublimated his urges and channeled his energies into what , by any standards , was a full life  --  as founder of a worldwide movement for youth , and as a brilliant soldier , who confounded the enemy at Mafeking by having his men step cautiously over an invisible fence of barbed wire ( possibly the only useful example of the art of mime in human history ) . <p> If he were around today , he 'd have spent years in therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , instead of being Number One Boy Scout , Lord Baden-Powell would probably be president of Dr. Laura 's bete-noire , the North American Man-Boy Love Association . Who can honestly say his was n't a better life for the marginalizing of his sex drive ? B-P 's Boy Scouts are n't anti-gay , they 're anti-sex : They 're founded on the proposition that there 's a lot of things young men can be doing that are more rewarding than sensual pleasure , whether with women , other men , or oneself . And looking at the vast amounts of human wreckage society 's piled up in the three decades since it began glorifying sex over all else , who could say Baden-Powell is wrong ? I 'm in favor of reinstating that New Jersey scoutmaster , but only if he starts sleeping on the balcony . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : A-rovering we shall go ! <p> By Mark Steyn <p> <p> Mark Steyn is theater critic of the New Criterion and movie critic of the Spectator of London <p> <p>     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
