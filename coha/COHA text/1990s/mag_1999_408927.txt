THERE ARE FOUR very compelling reasons why it 's better to wait until a few months after the fall season begins for our annual roundup . First , the preview tapes mailed out to reviewers around Labor Day are notoriously unreliable : Characters leave , storylines are altered , even a show 's title can change . Second , it 's infinitely more fin for readers actually to have seen the shows before reading reviews-just as it is more enjoyable to read a movie review after you 've seen the film . Third , even the most promising shows get canceled with dispatch , and this year was no exception ( " Wasteland " anyone ? ) . Fourth , and most important , I 'm pretty lazy and had absolutely no intention of plowing through 600 review tapes . So welcome to the Fall Roundup 1999 . Once and Again ( ABC , Tuesdays 10 p.m . E.T. ) . For those who still ca n't believe that " thirtysomething " was canceled ( and I 'm sure there are some of you out there ) your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Once and Again " features two attractive ( and too attractive ) recently divorced leads , well played by Billy Campbell and Sela Ward . Pace the critical encomiums heaped on this " groundbreaking " quality series , the two protagonists are simply Hope and Michael Steadman of " thirtysomething " 10 years later : affluent , hyperarticulate and painfully self-aware . The two are struggling with a relationship in the face of otherwise bothersome commitments ( i.e. , their families ) . The program 's most commented upon feature is the use of blackand-white monologues in which the characters share with the camera their innermost thoughts ( @ la MTV 's " The Real World " ) . While this is obviously meant to help viewers understand these deep-thinking , Pajero-driving people , it 's hard not to wonder : Who are they talking to ? Now and Again ( CBS , Fridays 9 p.m . E.T. ) . Not to be confused with " Once and Again , " this surprise hit is about an overweight workaday worker who dies in a freak subway accident . His brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of superhuman android , whom the government has cobbled together using what is invariably referred to in these situations as " the latest technology . " But while our hero enjoys his new powers and gets to beat up bad guys , he is forbidden to reveal himself to his wife . Instead he has to settle for making moony eyes at her and his beloved daughter from a distance , as Bette Midler would say . It 's a breezy enough offering , created by Glenn Gordon Caron , the same person who gave us " Moonlighting " a few years back ; it has that show 's offbeat humor and clever writing . Sadly , the actor who plays the new android ( Eric Close ) is half ( almost literally ) the actor who played the overweight exec : the wonderful John Goodman . It 's hard not to hope that someday he 'll get his old body back , and we 'll get John Goodman back . Judging Amy ( CBS , Tuesdays 10 p.m . E.T. ) is the latest in a series of shows about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . In this new offering we follow Amy Brenneman , a judge , and her relationship with her judgmental mother ( get it ? Judging Amy ? ) , played by the always resourceful Tyne Daly . Amy 's brother , portrayed by Dan Futterman , is a struggling writer , who , like all struggling TV writers , has a great apartment . The show follows hard on the heels of the success of last year 's " Providence , " about a doctor who moves back to her quaint home town ( only on TV could a city of 150,000 pass for quaint ) to restart her life . Despite being savaged by the critics ( who particularly objected to the soupy appearances of her late mother , now an angel , to dispense advice ) , " Providence " was a colossal ratings success . Apparently those predictions about how the youth market would drive the TV industry this fall were wildly off the mark . So far the biggest hits have been programs featuring professional women with great hair , and the real viewing powerhouse these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My So-Called Menopause . " Roswell ( WB , Wednesdays 9 p.m . E.T. ) is about three aliens who come to earth , decide to inhabit human bodies and are now searching for a way back home . Unfortunately for them , they initially chose little baby bodies , which means that they now are forced to experience adolescence . ( This perhaps explains their ardent desire to leave the planet . ) The conceit of the series is that while they feet " alien , " so do their human pals navigating their way through high school . It 's rather a derivative concept : " The X-Files " meets , well , name just about any teen-angst show , but it 's nicely written and usually appealing . And fortunately , since these are television ' ' -z aliens they almost never smile and therefore appear sullen and morose , making them the perfect TV teenagers . Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ( ABC , check local listings ) . ( Apparently , the producers spent everything on prize money and could n't afford a question mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of the same name , has supposedly taken the television industry completely by surprise . But why@ ( Or , in keeping with the title : But why . ) Is anyone surprised at our culture 's lust for money these days ? In " Millionaire , " the preternaturally chipper television host Regis Philbin ( Rege , to his friends ) hosts a high-tech game show with an old attraction : the questions are pretty easy . After a qualifying round , winners move on to a one-onone with Rege , where the questions move from easy ( " What 's your name ? " ) to difficult ( " How do you spell your name ? " ) . Still and all , it 's hard not to root for the pleasant , eager contestants who are allowed to telephone a friend for help . On one show a middle-aged man was confronted with this question : " What common household item takes its name from the inventor of antiseptic surgery ? " He called his mother , a former nurse , who gave him the correct answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said mom sweetly as she hung up . It almost gives avarice a good name . On the other hand , Fox 's copycat Greed ( check local listings ) is wretched . In addition to its smoky , cheesy sets , it boasts a decidedly different tone from " Millionaire . " Here , winning contestants move on to the aptly named " Tower of Greed " after host Chuck Woolery asks them , " Do you feel the need for greed ? " At least they 're honest about the show 's mercenary appeal . Expect many more game shows next season . ONE EXTREMELY GUILTY pleasure ( besides " South Park " ) is Comedy Central 's The Man Show ( check local listings , or maybe do n't ) . Before commenting further , I should include an official disclaimer . So here it is : " The Man Show " is boorish , crude , sexist , sophomoric and utterly devoid of redeeming social value . It is also very finny . And in this era of supposedly disappointed , bitter , and generally forlorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Susan Faludi 's Stiffed ) , here is a program that revels in being a guy , or , more accurately , a frat boy . That the show 's two young hosts , Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla , conduct the proceedings from their La-Z-Boys should give you some idea of the general tone and intellectual mise en scene of the program . Most of the show 's humor stems from their ( supposed ) inability to understand women . One skit featured a hidden camera in the home of one of the hosts , who claimed he had no idea what his wife did all day at home . As it turned out , after watering the plants ( " Gee , " said Mr. Kimmel , " I wondered who was doing that " ) , she drinks a bottle of Kaluha , and makes out with the UPS salesman , who has delivered a gun ( " Gee , she bought me a gun ! " ) , which she then uses for target practice on her husband 's picture . Our genial host gets annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fridge . ( " Hey , I was saving that for the game on Sunday ! " ) It 's quite amusing , but as I said , you 've been duly warned . Photograph The cast of " Now and Again " Photograph Judge Amy Brenneman // Returning favorite : After a disappointing last season , " E.R. " has been resuscitated by the addition of some promising new characters and a re-emphasis on some old favorites . ( It 's nice , for example , to see Dr. Corday as something more than a doormat for Dr. Benton . ) And with Gloria Reuben gone and Julianna Margulies about to hang up her scrubs , it 's just in time . Perhaps " E.R. " could take a leaf from " Law &; Order , " which seems to lose and replace major characters almost weekly , yet continues to improve in quality . Returning not-so-favorite : As if one " Ally McBeal " is n't enough , we now have the half-hour " Ally , " a sort of " Ally Lite , " as if such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aplenty , particularly during the fall sweeps week . Chief among the ratings stars was Disney 's delightful remake of " Annie , " starring the cr@me de la creme of Broadway 's current talent pool . And finally an Annie who could sing " Tomorrow " without inducing nation-wide gagging . " Aftershock . Earthquake in New York " featured a natural disaster in Gotham that reduced the town to rubble : every New Yorkhaters dream come true . But for New York-lovers , Ric Burns 's " New York : A Documentary Film " was manna from heaven : five straight episodes of people saying-a little defensively if you ask mehow great the city was . ( And please , enough pictures of the Empire State Building already . ) Finally , since this is a religious magazine , we must comment on NBC 's " Mary , Mother of Jesus " ( a tide to warm many a Nestorian 's heart ) . And here 's the comment : well intentioned but dull . On the other hand , who knew St. Elizabeth had such a lovely house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord , and ... my what a pretty window treatment ! Anyway , that 's the roundup for this season . Look forward to our spring roundup sometime around , oh , next Christmas . James Martin , 5. j .
