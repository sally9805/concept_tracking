MIKHAIL GORBACHEV IS NOT THE KIND OF statesman who could ever quietly fade away into history . The collapse of the U.S.S.R. may have left the former Soviet President without a job or a country , but he has continued to speak his mind with the same confident authority he had in the past , and he travels abroad now with the honor and respect due a ruling leader . Gorbachev has done nothing to disabuse admirers of the impression that his political career is far from over . During a visit this month to Tokyo , he speculated about a possible comeback , drawing an analogy to French President Charles de Gaulle , who resigned in 1946 out of impatience with party political maneuvering , to return in 1958 at the age of 68 . " I am only 61 , " quipped Gorbachev . " That means there is a chance . " <P> Given Gorbachev 's hectic " retirement " schedule , it is amazing that he found the time and tranquillity to write about his fall from power . But historians should beware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating narrative makes no pretense of offering a scrupulously detailed or unbiased account of the events last year that transformed the modern world . There are no revelations here about what went on behind closed Kremlin doors . These are the passionate jottings of a man who is willing to acknowledge his mistakes but remains unreconciled to present-day realities . Gorbachev continues to believe the old Soviet republics would be better off in a new union ; history , it appears , cheated him of this goal . <P> Gorbachev is selective in reviewing the recent past . He remains silent about one of the most puzzling episodes of his final year in office : why he abruptly abandoned radical economic reforms in the fall of 1990 and made common cause with hard-liners in the military and KGB . Some would argue that this was the pivotal moment in the decline and fall of the Soviet Empire . Gorbachev describes this period with remarkable understatement as " particularly difficult . " He will only admit that he should have " seized the moment " and invited democratic groups to join him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also sheds no light on the January 1991 crackdown in the Baltic republics , which seriously tarnished his image abroad as a reformer . He notes in the vaguest terms that there was " an escalation in confrontation , " and that " the threat of dictatorship was real . " <P> Some of Gorbachev 's assessments betray wishful thinking about what might have been . He blames the August coup attempt for making any efforts to overhaul the Communist Party and introduce a more measured program of market reforms " impossible . " The putsch certainly accelerated the breakup of the Soviet state , but it is debatable whether Gorbachev would have achieved either aim had the hard-liners not made their move . By the summer of 1991 , Kremlin power was already ebbing away to republican leaders like Russia 's Boris Yeltsin ; the party was clearly headed for a schism . It is also doubtful , as Gorbachev suggests , that he might have succeeded in his second attempt to form a new , looser union in the months after the putsch if the Russians had not wavered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming vote for independence in Ukraine might somehow have been reversed , and was not an insurmountable obstacle to his plan .
