When first meeting her , you quickly learn two things about Shannen Doherty . One , her face is more symmetrical in person than it is onscreen . And two , if you visit the set of her new WB series Charmed and happen to sit in the canvas director-style chair with her name stenciled on the back , she wo n't punch you in the face or break a beer bottle over your head when she finds you there . In truth , she 's perfectly gracious and nonvolatile . Is there anything more you really wanted to know on the subject ? <P> Someday , when Charmed is forgotten , the former star of Beverly Hills , 90210 will still be a touchstone of early ' 90s nostalgia , the era 's iconic teenage girl in her role as pouty , headstrong Brenda Walsh . The naturalness of Doherty 's bratty but earnest characterization helped make the show a hit by the end of its first season ( 1990-91 ) . There was sudden fame and magazine covers , but it is a time that Doherty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world to know that she is not the same person she was when she was regularly written up in the tabloids for fighting in nightclubs , threatening to shoot a fiance , trashing rental properties , throwing tantrums on the 90210 set , marrying Ashley Hamilton , dating Judd Nelson . <P> She explains it all thusly : " I was 21 years old , trying to grow up and figure out who I was , and I did n't consciously think , ' Maybe I should be real low-key and stay in my house . ' Instead I was like , ' I 'm 21 and I can go out and have a great time and sort of experience the whole college life , ' if you will . I made myself an easy target . But that was a really long time ago . " That , of course , depends on your definition of " really long . " ( Last year she agreed to undergo anger-management counseling after breaking a beer bottle over a car . ) But surely no one , no matter how famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collegiate doings , or the equivalent , covered regularly in the National Enquirer . <P> Doherty left 90210 in 1994 , reportedly not on the best of terms with her colleagues , including executive producer Aaron Spelling , who on Charmed is once again her boss . Both Doherty and Spelling claim that any animosity on either side was greatly exaggerated . Spelling approached her earlier this year with the idea of returning to 90210 , which in its ninth season is already about two cycles past its prime . Doherty declined , although she says she might make a special appearance for a season finale . <P> Spelling then offered her Charmed , a dramatic series about three young sisters who wear slip dresses , complain about dating and in the premiere episode , discover they are witches . The series , which has drawn surprisingly good ratings , manages to tap into TV 's current fascination with the occult ( The X-Files , Buffy the Vampire Slayer ) while recalling the classic three-babe structure of Spelling 's ' 70s hit Charlie 's Angels . Here , Doherty would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most beautiful one but not necessarily the sexiest . ( Alyssa Milano gets the Farrah Fawcett-Majors pinup part , while Holly Marie Combs is stuck with Kate Jackson . ) <P> As for offscreen witchiness , Doherty reports that with 14-to-18-hour days on the set , she has little time for anything but sleep . " I just go home , " she says  --  more proof that the ' 90s are all but over . <P>  --  By Bruce Handy
