While some top Clinton administration officials ( and even Hillary ) may be pining for a photo op in the Balkan war zone , they will have to get their snapshots the hard way . When Deputy Secretary of State STROBE TALBOTT flew in to the Macedonian capital of Skopje a few weeks ago in one of the Air Force 's Lockheed C-130s , he got the ride of his life . The problem for potential future visitors : Talbott 's plane was " painted , " meaning that the Serbian military 's antiaircraft system had got the plane in its target sight . Talbott 's flight crew immediately began to swoop violently and dive the plane to make it harder to hit , tossing a few passengers about and causing at least one to start crossing himself furiously . The plane was landed safely . But every U.S. official since then has taken the long road  --  literally  --  a three-hour trip by armored car from Greece to Macedonia . <P>  --  By Sally B.
