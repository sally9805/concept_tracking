WITH CHOPSTICKS POISED , Peter Cordero drove into the onion cake and spicy smoked ham at the Hunan on Sansome Street . At home in New Orleans he worked as a food spy , even though he enjoyed eating too much to send anything back , which is what he was paid to do . He was hired by restaurants to secretly evaluate waiters and cooks , but he liked to think of himself as an incognito food critic . This was the first time he 'd been back in San Francisco in two years , since he 'd written a gourmet column for one of those weekly consumer rags he still thought of as " underground . " Unfortunately , he was here for another memorial service . This time it was n't AIDS or breast cancer . <p> This time it was Limmel , shaggy , goofy , gold-rim-spectacled Limmel , as Peter always remembered him from the commune on Baker Street . Limmel , a.k.a . Sea Ananda , guru to the stars . Vegan , celibate , hardworking , herb-tea-sipping Limmel , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Peter 's mother had doctor 's pills . Limmel Rock , another Immortalist dead as a doornail . <p> " What 'd your little friend way out there die of ? " Peter 's mother had asked before he caught his flight yesterday afternoon . Though he was forty-seven , she still called his friends " little . " And the city where he 'd lived for sixteen years was known as " way out there . " <p> " I do n't know , " he had replied , curling the phone cord around his index finger . " Guess he starved himself to death . He called himself an Immortalist , and believed that you do n't have to die if you eat the right food , do n't smoke , drink , or have sex , and spend most of the day sunk in the tub . Something about how in water you escape the effects of gravity . It 's one of those California ideas . " <p> " So what 'd he die of , immortality ? Or a heart attack when he got his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't eating much . Just a few nuts and pieces of fruit a day . He thought most food was poisoned . " <p> " Poison ! Lord , I wish I could stick to a diet like that . Me , I eat everything in sight . So , what you think of that stuffed eggplant I made on Friday ? It turned out a little on the mooshy side , with too much shrimp and crabmeat and not enough Parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs , do n't you think ? " <p> His mother 's stuffed eggplant was perfect , and she knew it . At eighty-two , she was hobbling around her kitchen on swollen ankles with a hot casserole in her hand , laughing raucously at her jokes and praising her own cooking . Her last wish was that the family not eat at Mandina 's across from the funeral parlor after her wake . There 's too much butter in the meuniere sauce , she insisted , and the string beans are canned . <p> Hours later , as Peter tore open the foil pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limmel 's ten-almonds-a-day diet . Peter had been chopping onions for a pot of red beans when a wispy voice phoned to tell him Limmel Rock had " vacated his vessel . " Limmel had left instructions that his oldest friend-Peter Cordero on Dante Street in New Orleans-scatter his ashes from Lands End . Peter jotted down the time and place of the memorial service on the back of a restaurant invoice . Then he rocked all afternoon on the gallery in a weepy daze while the beans burned . <p> Under the jet wing , rose-tinged clouds were spread in every direction like a comforter . Way out there , he sang to himself , I 'm going way out there . No angels strumming harps up here , but he thought he could make out the sunken eyes of Limmel 's meditating Buddha skull in a dark formation on the western horizon . When he blinked , the only face staring back from the oval porthole was his own-bearded , pink , and ripe . <p> After lunch at the Hunan , Peter strolled through North Beach toward Stockton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer to the N-Judah car to take him to the Immortalist Center in the Outer Sunset . After the sticky armpit of Louisiana , the June weather here was perfectsunny , crisply cool-with angular views of almost edible pastel Victorians framed by brilliant blue . <p> Actually , this incessant pleasantness annoyed him no end , like the goateed lawyers with cell-phones glued to their pierced ears , slurping decaf , low-fat lattes next to bulbous muffins at cafes along Columbus Avenue . A regular theme park of bohemia . Cookies and milk , the only vices left out here are cookies and milk , he thought , flicking his cigarette butt into the gutter . I 'd much rather live in the ruins of the Confederacy than in the ruins of the ' 60s . There , at least , it 's no skin off my lost dreams . <p> With relief , he shoved his way onto Stockton , toward the crowded fish stalls and vegetable stands of Chinatown . For years now this had been the only place in San Francisco where he felt real . Here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants and rotting mango perfumes . He walked past double-parked trucks disgorging barrels of live fish and whole hog carcasses , elbowed his way past cages of live frogs and chickens , tubs of languid turtles and scrambling crabs , disheveled mountains of bok choy , dried mushrooms , and papayas . <p> How the hell could Limmel starve to death in the middle of all this ? Nearby was the Basque Hotel , where he and Limmel had shared a room that summer before the commune . Broke , at night they scavenged French bread and flowers from the trash in front of Italian restaurants , and filled the room with patchouli incense while drinking Burgundy from gallon jugs . Limmel had long blond hair down to his waist , as satiny and wavy as a Breck commercial , and Peter 's Mediterranean ' fro frizzed out into a pubic halo that bounced as he walked . Often they had made love to their girlfriends at the same time on the big bed that creaked in counterpoint to two rhythms ; the four of them would then fall asleep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cable cars clang by . <p> After the summer of cheap wine and week-old roses , Peter and Limmel had settled into a strict routine at the Bodhisattva commune in the Haight , lured by free rent and homemade LSD . The commune was run by a middle-aged writer named Arnold Goldstein who had published one famous novel in the ' 60s , then moved to San Francisco on a petroleum trust fund to save the planet with collectivism , vegetarianism , and herbal enemas . With his Louisiana accent and irreverent humor , Peter was soon banished from the Sunflower Room to the compost heap . Limmel 's ethereal looks and Pennsylvania-Dutch business sense earned him a place as altar boy in the Sunflower Room and as bookkeeper for the commune 's health-food shop , the Hungry Organ . <p> Years later , Peter had realized this was the point when the hippie movement first began to harden into an ideology . Limmel bought it , and thrived . But Peter , brandishing a hoe and declaring himself a Spanish anarchist in a showdown with Arnold in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering back to the rumpled corduroys and smudged mimeos of North Beach . Not only did Peter refuse to squirt sage water up his butt in purification rites , but he did n't want to be told what to eat , who to sleep with , or how long to meditate in the Sunflower Room . The last straw was when Arnold made Limmel raid other communes ' refrigerators , sniffing for meat . If he found any , the sinners were cut out of the Hungry Organ 's food co-op . <p> Peter chuckled out loud at the bus stop , recalling the meat raids and how he had screamed at Limmel that he was n't really a spiritual revolutionary but just another Lutheran cop . Limmel had risen to become heir apparent to the Sunflower Throne , and after Arnold was busted for his acid lab , he began to market Arnold 's whole bag of tricks as " spirit-cleansing workshops . " He attracted his own followers , mostly divorced women who had moved to California and changed their names to Maya or Shanti . Then David Bowie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became guru to the stars . Peter had a snapshot of him from that era , glamorous in round black sunglasses and an Afghani lamb's-wool coat , emerging from a white BMW on his first day back after three months in an ashram in Poona , India . He had sat in on some of Limmel 's workshops , and complimented him as the ultimate con man . Sea Ananda , as he now called himself , had even shared some of his kurta-clad Mayas and Shantis with Baba-Pete , for old times ' sake , at his temple hot tub in the Marin redwoods . <p> They lost touch during the ' 80s , when Peter was studying at the Cordon Bleu in Paris and living in a postage-stamp-sized attic apartment in the thirteenth arrondissement with a Spanish girlfriend who sang sevillanas as she hung wash on their narrow terrace . Years later in San Francisco , when they finally arranged to meet again at a tapas bar in the Mission that Peter was reviewing , Limmel just ordered a bottle of mineral water . <p> Peter , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recognized his old friend . Limmel was gaunt , shaved bald , dressed all in black , with a severely serene expression . His only conversation was about what he was n't eating , smoking , or screwing-nothing and no one . He nixed the idea of smoking a number on the patio before dinner , would n't touch the wine or beer , and when the gambas al ajillo arrived , looked like he was in mortal pain . <p> " Feel sorry for the shrimp ? " Peter asked , spearing one with a toothpick , Andalusian style . <p> " I feel the pain of all sentient beings , and I do n't care to have dead animals rotting in my stomach . I do n't eat any cooked food at all . I am centering my diamond body . Preparing it for eternity . " <p> So while Peter ate , sopping up the garlic sauce with hunks of crusty bread , and threw back half a bottle of Rioja , he listened to Limmel explain the Immortalist Center . From what he could gather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lotus pool in the backyard , or cultivating the few fruit and nut trees they ate from . The trees were fertilized with Tibetan yak ca-ca blessed by someone in Berkeley who guaranteed eternal life to anyone who bought his shit . The Immortalists made a living as computer programmers , and Limmel went on and on about the Immortalist website . <p> " Any foxy Immortalist babes in the commune ? " Peter asked , trying to change the subject . <p> Limmel stared intently at a shrimp tail in the middle of the table , then shot Peter an empty look . <p> " I mean why do you want to live forever , for Christ 's sake , if you ca n't enjoy anything ? " <p> " Enjoy ? " Limmel pronounced the word as if he 'd bitten into a rotten pear . <p> Peter poured himself another glass of wine and pushed back from the table . " You 're in one hell of a midlife crisis , buddy . But look , if you can still say all this at a hundred and twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to congratulate you . " <p> Limmel had lost the argument at forty-eight , but Peter felt no vindication as he boarded a 30-Stockton packed with elderly Chinese balancing pink plastic sacks of food . A damp paper bag on the lap of the old woman seated next to him was rustling with life . With two wizened fingers she skillfully removed a blue crab , which she turned over to inspect , its claws waving frantically in Peter 's face . Peter waved back . Then she dropped the fat female back in her bag with a satisfied smile as the bus entered the Stockton Tunnel . <p> The Pacific Ocean really begins at 19th Avenue , Peter decided as he whizzed along on the empty N-Judah car through the chill underwater mirage of the Outer Sunset . Tufts of fog came swirling up the planetary street , blurring the shapes of squat storefronts and row houses that seemed stranded in the dunes of a mournful sea . Staring out the window , Peter felt as though he were peering into an aquarium where all the fish had died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the West Sunset Playground . Shivering in his seersucker sportcoat , Peter trudged along with shoulders hunched against the gusty wind , smoking a cigarette . He doubted you could light up in the Immortalist Center . For a moment he lingered in front of the International UFO Museum and Alien T-Shirt Shop , scanning an urgent xerox taped to the window about the takeover of the government from outer space . The shop was closed on Wednesdays . <p> He found the address , a 1950s two-storey stucco painted lavender with black trim . A stone-faced woman seemed to be frisking people as they entered . <p> " I smell tobacco , " she announced as Peter approached . " Well , Fee Fie Fo Fum to you too , lady . I just put it out , OK ? Look , Limmel Rock was my best friend for a long time , and I 've come all the way from New Orleans to scatter his ashes . " <p> " This center is also a fragrance-free zone . Some of us suffer from severe allergies , environmental illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor you for deodorants or colognes before you enter our safe area . " <p> Then this wiry woman with the fuzzy gray scalp-cut began to sniff Peter like a Rottweiler , opening his jacket and almost sticking her snout into his pits . It turned him on . <p> She wrinkled her pointy nose . " I ca n't smell anything but garlic . " And then she brightened . " Garlic is a natural antibiotic . " <p> " Yeah , I like my tetracycline stir-fried with smoked ham . Did you know Limmel ? " <p> " Yes , of course . He 'd been with us for several years . " Her puckered mouth was twitching at the corners , trying to smile . " You may go in . " <p> Peter stepped inside as though walking into a tax audit . The floors and walls were bare and spotless , and there was a diamond-shaped fixture spinning like a disco ball from the ceiling , casting amethyst facets of light against the white walls . Woozy New Age music was gurgling from a lone speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , on a low silver altar , were a square urn and a photo of Limmel . Peter inched over to study it . Limmel had never looked worse . His face was emaciated , lost in its own shadows . In front of the picture were a brass bowl of almonds and a few wilted white chrysanthemums . <p> Several neuter Immortalists with skeletal ribcages were practicing their breathing on meditation cushions scattered across the floor . A group of overweight ladies , who once might have been named Maya or Shanti , were milling around in their multicultural muumuus admiring one another 's interesting earrings . California is no place to grow old , Peter thought . No wonder Limmel moved in here to off himself . The Immortalist Center is a fucking suicide club for aging hippies . <p> Suddenly someone grabbed his ass with both hands . Peter spun around into the arms of Leah , as long and bony as when he and Limmel both had bounced her on that big Basque bed . <p> " Let me look at you , sweetheart ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted as the Immortalists looked up sourly . " What are you now , queen of grunge ? " <p> She was dressed in frayed denim and flannel , and informed him her new name was something he could n't remember that began with a Z. She let him know in her customary machine-gun delivery that she was n't a confused Jewish princess anymore ; she was a lesbian animalrights activist who lived in Berkeley with a girlfriend suffering from environmental illness . And she had a joint in her pocket . <p> " Leah , I 'm sorry to hear about all this , " Peter responded , dragging her by the hand past the Rottweiler at the door , " except for about the chicks and the joint . That I can relate to . " <p> For an hour they sat hunched over on the hood of her old Volvo , catching up , rehashing old times , doing what middle-aged people do at funerals . Peter was sorry there was only a Korean grocery across the street and not a Mandina 's , where they could reminisce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And so I was near the Basque Hotel just yesterday , picketing the Chinese stores on Stockton for animal cruelty . You should see how they clobber those frogs and turtles , then tear their guts out . " <p> " Honey , leave the Chinese alone . They know what they 're doing . They been at it for five thousand years . Back where I come from , it 's considered a good night if just the frogs get hit over the head . Come on , you do n't like frog legs with lemon and butter ? " he drawled in disbelief . <p> " Give me a break , " she groaned , sticking her finger down her throat in a vulgarity left over from the ' 80s . " So yesterday this store owner walks out to disrupt our rally , and I 'm like , ' I hope you come back as a frog in your next lifetime . ' And he goes , And I hope you come back as a fly . Then I eat you . ' " <p> They both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn from the eternal struggle between flies , frogs , and Chinese butchers in the last few years . Leah approved of his diet , though she thought he 'd needed a supplementary starch . Peter said he thought he 'd needed an oyster po'boy , a roll in the hay , and a one-way ticket out of San Francisco . <p> They were both buzzed by the time they approached the Immortalist Center . They were met at the door by the Rottweiler woman , who told them they had missed the ceremony that channeled Limmel 's reconstituted body to the eternal diamond sphere . Then , as if putting out the garbage , she held out the urn of ashes to be scattered off Lands End . It was seven o'clock and almost their bedtime . They were going to meditate in the lotus pool . <p> " Immortalists must get pretty depressed at their own funerals , " Peter commented , walking down the steps . <p> " Limmel probably fucking died of pneumonia , " Leah snorted as they scooted into her car , Peter balancing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at that so-called lotus pool ? It 's a slimy tank where those skinny assholes sit like frogs eight hours a day up to their necks in algae . Out here in the fog ? The neighbors are suing them because the drain split and is leaking into their yard . And the Immortalists are suing the swimming pool company that put it in . I never want to set foot in there again . Besides , it 's racist , sexist , and homophobic . " <p> " I ca n't imagine Rupaul wanting to join up , if that 's what you mean , " Peter mumbled , twisting a radio dial that did n't work . <p> Ponderous with the prospect of scattering Limmel Rock to the wind , they drove along the beach as all the light in the world was about to be swallowed by the Pacific . This is it , Peter thought , as if he were a pallbearer for the last citizen of Byzantium : the end of an era that had brought unimaginable freedom and joy before it turned , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt like rolling down the window and shouting at the horizon , GOOD-BYE , CALIFORNIA ! <p> But California kept shifting fast as the horizon , and he was tired of chasing it , reinventing himself every five years , remodeling his dreams , running after an imaginary meridian that , like youth , was gone . Like Limmel , simply gone . He looked over at Leah in her latest incarnation , dear beat-up , buzz-cut old Leah . There were tears running down her cheeks , too . <p> Peter tapped the metal box in his lap . Here is the missing piece of the puzzle : so the end of the line is a stucco house in the Outer Sunset , last stop before America vanishes , where a bunch of ex-revolutionaries sits scared shitless in a frogpond in the fog , worrying themselves sick about death . Now the big secret is out . And the repressive stuff they 'd rebelled against has clanked back into place with a vengeance because-and this is why it was there in the first place-you gon na die , motherfucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty-four , back by the barbecue pit last week with that dumb apron on , drinking his bourbon highball and reading the paper . Call it bravery or stupidity , but after the Battle of the Bulge , his father knew how much this rotting piece of meat is worth . By the pound . By the ounce . <p> They swerved past the Cliff House restaurant , where he 'd brought his parents when they visited and his mother had raved about the scallops while his father made a drunken pass at the waitress . Then they pulled into a dirt parking lot . <p> Leah took off her distressed-leather jacket and draped it around Peter 's shoulders . The wind howling in their ears , they wobbled up a path smelling of fennel and salt air , along a barrier of dwarfed conifers hunched over by the force of the ocean , like the fingers of drowning men hanging onto the last ledge of land . <p> Soon they were standing on a sheer promontory in front of a concrete bench under a canopy of dead limbs , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to take Limmel out of his can . <p> " Here , can you get this open ? " Peter asked , handing the urn to Leah and fumbling to button the jacket collar around his neck . They were both windblown and freezing by the time they finally dipped their hands inside , shocked by the gravelly texture of the remains . <p> " Say something , Peter . Say words . Limmel needs words , " Leah shouted to be heard over the wind . <p> " Libera me , Domine , de morte aeterna , in die illa tremenda : Quando caeli movendi sunt et terra , " Peter sang in a choirboy tenor as they both threw handfuls of ash into the air . " Requiem aeternam dona eis , Domine : et lux perpetua luceat eis . " <p> As Peter opened wide to sing the " Kyrie , eleison , Christe , eleison , " the wind whipped ashes back into his face , filling his mouth with charcoal pebbles . He gagged . <p> Sputtering , he spun around wild-eyed to Leah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed like someone who did n't expect to be heard . His spindly legs took off , and he raced back down the fennel path as if pursued . <p> In the parking lot at the end of the open road , Peter fell to his knees and vomited . Onion cakes . Rice , Smoked ham . Between dry heaves , one decade after another came up in a spasm , the ' 60s and ' 70s , then the ' 80s and ' 90s . He crouched under the lone streetlight , his neck stretched forward as though awaiting a blow from on high . Ashes drooled down his chin and through his beard , the ashes of everyone he had ever loved mixed with everything he had ever eaten , the Pacific pounding inside his head against the Western Gate . <p> Looking up , he saw Leah moving toward him through the mist , her silhouette as serene as a figure in a T'ang dynasty painting . Running his tongue along the inside of his teeth , he knew he would never get that taste out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how beautiful or how young . <p>
