You 'd be hard pressed to find a recession-era newspaper or magazine that 's free of a quote or column or economic forecast from Peter Morici , a professor at the University of Maryland 's business school and former chief economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission . Morici routinely discusses bailouts and trade deficits , but he rarely gets asked for career advice . Until now . Here , in a recent chat with U.S. News , the economist offers his take on the opportunity cost of going back to school and the best strategies for navigating the job market as an older worker . Excerpts : Is this a good time for people to spend the money and go back to school ? It depends on your age . For young people who were planning to go back to school anyway , the time has arrived . The opportunity cost is much less now , as long as they 're doing something that 's really going to get them a degree with obvious payback . Which ones have obvious payback ? Now , you could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school with brand loyalty among employers in the region where you want to find a job . Remember , there are plenty of bad M.B.A . degrees . You could study and get a degree in social work -- those kinds of things lead to jobs . You want to avoid -- and forgive me for getting personal -- a master 's in journalism . What 's the best strategy for older workers who have lost their jobs ? For older people who do n't want to go back to school or can not go back to school because the starting costs are high , you want to think about what your generic skills are . If you were working as a journalist , you can write -- and there are a lot of writing jobs in government and industry . So being flexible is the key ? They 're often fallback jobs , not as exciting as what you were doing before , but they pay the rent . If you 're going to stay in the job market , be more flexible about geography and more flexible about using your generic skills . It 's also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriages . Their marriages ? Why ? People start sniping at each other . It 's important to evaluate your job prospects and come up with a strategy for meeting minimal financial goals . People do a lot of dumb things during recessions -- sell their house , become renters -- and they regret the money they lost . It 's important to look at everything in your marriage that way . One partner might accept being the lower earner . Be pragmatic about these things . The recession is not going to last forever . The idea is not to burn up capital . Is going back to school an option only for the unemployed ? What about people lucky enough to still be working , even if they 're in dead-end jobs ? If you are a teacher , this is a good time to get an administrative degree . If you are faced with stagnating wages and lack of opportunity where you work , it 's a good time to go back to school as long as the degree has obvious payback . This is the time to take that hit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve specific employment or personal goals . OK . Here 's an economic question for an economist : When do you think workers can expect to see some good news about the job market ? In the fourth quarter of 2009 or early 2010.
