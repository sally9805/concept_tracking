Heitman , the queerbait , the insane , is my tentmate . Again . Porter , the fat kid who cries a lot , cried again this morning , saying he did n't want to tent with Heitman ever again . Last night Heitman put ticks on Porter 's eyelashes while he slept . This morning our Scoutmaster , Casper , had to pluck them off with tweezers , since the hot match trick was too dangerous that close to his eyeball . The ticks came away with tiny chunks of Porter 's eyelid clasped in their jaws , like grains of sand . Casper said this was good ; if the head stayed in , Porter could lose the eye . He told Heitman one more time and he was out . As soon as he left the tent , Heitman dropped his pants and pretended to masturbate violently in Casper 's direction . <p> Two nights ago Heitman leapt off his cot in the middle of the night and onto my back , bucking frantically . " Bergie , " he cried . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I tried to twist out from underneath him , but he knew where to put his knees . <p> " You bastard , " I cried , " get off me , " but Heitman was laughing and slapping the back of my head . <p> " We 're buddies , are n't we ? " Heitman said . " Say we 're hunch buddies , Bergman . Hunch buddies forever He stopped suddenly , before I could say anything , and got off me . I turned over and saw that the moon was out and shining through the fabric of the roof . Heitman was half-dressed . He stood bent over , peering out the front flap of the tent . His shoelaces were untied , and his shirt was off . He had his Scout neckerchief tucked in the back pocket of his jeans . He turned around , his black hair in his eyes , and said , loud over the crickets , " Let 's go out , Bergman . Let 's go explore . " <p> " Heitman , " I tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's impossible . " He ignores me and wades out farther into the stream in his underwear , the moonlight reflecting around where his knees disappear into the current . He rises up and sinks down , stepping on hidden shelves and rock formations , not seeming to worry about his balance . He stops on a high spot and squats down , his hands in front of him . <p> " They 're sleeping , " he says . " You sneak up on them while they 're sleeping . " I can see his rounded back and the row of tiny knobs that runs up to his neck . The rippling water of the stream makes his back look strange . It looks striped like a trout , or maybe like he 's been whipped . <p> I settle back and look up at the sky , listening to the screaming of the frogs and crickets . My eyes are just starting to close when something cold and spiny hits me on the throat , falls to the ground , and lies there flipping in the dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He squats next to the fish . It has stopped moving , its upturned eye brilliantly white against the dark ground . It arches its tail and lets it fall . Its gills open and close , and its mouth flexes , the moon reflecting off the edges of its scales . Heitman picks it up and walks over to the water . <p> " Do n't hold it tight , " I tell him . " Just let it go easy . If you hold it tight then its scales will rot away It 's something my grandfather told me . He never touched the fish he threw back ; he cut his best hooks apart with wire trimmers rather than tear up their mouths . He tried to save the small ones , but still when he let them go , some just arced over slow and slid away . <p> Heitman turns and bends sideways at the waist and launches the fish straight up into the sky . It disappears , and for a second there is no sound , just the crickets and the rustling water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a dropped stone . Its body does n't move , but its mouth opens and closes , slower than before . Its eye is now dark and may be gone , I ca n't tell . I pick it up and walk over to the edge of the stream . The fish is bone-rigid in my hand , frozen in an arc . I bend down and wash the dirt off . But the eye is still black , and I toss it up gently over the water . Seconds later it hits with a small splash , shattering the reflection of the moon , and disappears . <p> Heitman is furious . " That 's fine , " he says , shaking water from his arms . " That 's just great . Now what do I have to show ? " He grabs his pants and starts up the path . He does n't say a word to me all the way back to camp . <p> The next day around the steam tables , everyone talks about Friday night , the Order of the Arrow ceremony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on , and Old Willy is watching television under the bus tarp . Old Willy is Casper 's father , and he invented the steam tables and the water heater and fixed up the old school bus that takes us around . We know that no other Scout troop has an electrical generator , no other troop gets to wear jeans and not wear shirts and smoke cigarettes just about whenever they please . We are lucky . Casper has always preferred a more natural , Indian-style philosophy . According to Casper , the old army scouts were just half-ass Indians at best , and he considers most of the standard Boy Scout stuff silly . Summer camp is the only organized camp he lets his troop attend , because of the Order of the Arrow ceremony , where each troop selects a few of its boys to be transformed into men , the way the Indians used to . <p> " Merit badges are for pussies , " Casper says . " Uniforms are for mailmen . I should make you all get tattoos instead Casper has tattoos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal toes . He is a Korean veteran , the seniors say . He has a medal for valor against the enemy , and a scar on his shoulder from a Chinese bayonet . He 's tough , but fair , he likes to say . Every kid gets a fair shake . <p> Casper 's right-hand men are the senior troop leaders . They 're in high school , and they do n't eat with the rest of us , the small ones . The only one of us they can tolerate is Heitman , who they get a charge out of . They 've learned that Heitman will do almost anything anyone dares him to do ; he eats small animals raw , sets his hair on fire , that kind of thing . He eats at their fire , but they wo n't let him sleep with them in their canopy tent . Heitman has been known to howl at night ; an unearthly cry , like rutting hyenas at a fire drill , Casper says . The only time Heitman can be sure not to howl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tells everyone I 'm his official Hunch Buddy , and whatever they think , everybody pretty much leaves me alone . When I walk by , they whisper to each other . I know what I am called . I am Heitman 's girlfriend . <p> The seniors spend most of their time sitting around their own fire , smoking cigarettes and telling stories about women they 've molested . Chadwell is the biggest . He has removable front teeth and long , black hair parted in the middle . In camp he wears feathers in it , two of them that dangle just next to his ear . Sometimes he soots the area under his eyes . Garcia is only slightly smaller , but with bigger shoulders . He sits next to Chadwell and breaks the wood that goes into the fire with his bare hands , sometimes using the arch of his shoulders for leverage . He once hit me in the back of the head for leaving grease in one of the big pots I was cleaning . The next day he came up to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really et , and I 've been friends with him ever since . I give him the cigarettes I steal from my mother but do n't smoke . <p> Heitman has gotten ahold of some Mace from somewhere . His father is a mailman , he says , but I know he 's lying . Heitman lives on the street behind mine , and everybody on the block knows that his father stays home all day , looking after his chinchillas . Mr. Heitman has a patent on a chinchilla-killing machine that hooks up to a car battery . He calls it the Chilla-Killa . You clamp one electrode to the chinchilla 's ear and the other to its tail , then throw the switch before they tear themselves loose . They stiffen right up , Mr. Heitman told me , right up like a big furry dick . It 's not the volts , he said , it 's the amps . He shook a dead chinchilla in my face and laughed when I screamed . <p> We sit on a stone wall by the front gate to the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line of Scouts who are marching in to use the lake . They 're from the rich kids ' troop . We 're out of uniform , so their Scoutmaster does n't even acknowledge us . He knows what troop we 're from , and he hates Casper . Earlier in the week , he tried to get us kicked out of the camp , on account of our conduct at Taps , but nobody did anything . They were too afraid of us . Every night , the other troop stands at attention while the flag is lowered , while we put our hands in our pockets and whistle over the pathetic hooting of their fat-faced bugler . The Scoutmaster closes his eyes in fury , and when the sound dies , he marches his kids quickly down the hill to his own camp . <p> The troop passes the stone wall , and Heitman Maces the last kid in line as he marches by , eyes forward . It 's quick , and the kid does n't seem to know what it is , he just wipes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the corner of the pool , the kid shaking his head , and Heitman stashes the Mace under a loose stone that had fallen from the wall . " Crap does n't work , " he says . " Would n't you know ? " We walk the long way back to camp , and Heitman traps a black rat snake next to the path . Back in the tent , we put it in a box and collect tree toads . The snake swallows four toads before Heitman throws it into the hot water tank . It boils and turns gray and hard as a spring , its eyes completely white . <p> The seniors are grimly practicing being Indians for the ceremony when the Scoutmaster from the other troop marches in , red-faced . He walks up to Casper , his forefinger shaking , and wants to see all of the troop . One of his boys got sent to the hospital after being shot in the face with something . It might have been acid , he says . He 'll know the boys who did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I come out of the tent in full uniform , more or less , trying to disguise myself . Heitman is nowhere to be found . Casper lines us up , and the Scoutmaster starts at one end , looking each of us up and down for a long time , then moving on to the next . His face is still red , and his mouth set , but after a few kids , it 's clear he 's not cut out for this sort of thing . He 's starting to lose his nerve ; he 's too soft for this kind of thing . Even fat Porter senses it and seems to sneer at him . Casper follows next to him and tries to keep him moving along the line . He 's on our side . <p> There is a noise behind me , and Heitman moves in next to me , naked except for his gray underpants . He stands rigid , almost not breathing , perfectly at attention . His bony chest is thrust out , and the hollows above his collarbone are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , takes one look , and taps Casper on the shoulder . " That 's one of them , " he says , pointing at me . I look at Casper , and his face is stone . <p> " Which was he ? " he says . " The one with the can or the other one ? " <p> " The other one , " says the Scoutmaster , already moving on . He stops and squints at Heitman . He looks at Heitman 's face but not at the rest of him . Heitman 's face is cold , reptilian . His eyes do n't blink and do n't focus . The Scoutmaster draws away for a second , then leans forward , close to Heitman 's face . " Have you got a problem , young man , standing here in your underpants ? " Heitman smiles softly , then looks the Scoutmaster in the eye . Up close , the Scoutmaster 's face is soft and freckled , and his eyelashes are just wisps of white above his eyes . He has a sparse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harelip . The mustache quivers , like a rabbit , and it is a second before I realize that it is something the Scoutmaster ca n't control . He stands there , staring at Heitman , and everyone knows after a couple of seconds he does n't have the courage to call him out . <p> Sure enough , he moves on and finishes the line . Under the bus tarp , the seniors have quit being Indians and sit around a table , playing cards loud and smoking cigarettes . When they notice the Scoutmaster looking at them , they lower their cards and stare at him . The Scoutmaster looks for a moment as if he might go over , but thinks the better of it and turns around . He sees Casper walk up to me and slap me hard across the face . <p> " Who was it ? " Casper says . " Talk to me , and I wo n't kick the living shit out of you . " <p> " Hey , " says the Scoutmaster , " there 's no need for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Scoutmaster shoves in front of Casper and bends down at the waist , his hand on my shoulder . " No one 's going to hurt you he says . He 's breathing hard , and his hand shakes on my shoulder . " I have a boy in the hospital , " he says . " You understand ? " I shake my head , and my throat snags when I breathe in . <p> The Scoutmaster turns to Casper . " I mean , he 's going to be all right and everything . It 's just the idea . " Casper looks at him without saying anything . The Scoutmaster shakes his head , his face is terrible to look at . " I mean , " he says , " I mean , the boy is hurt . " He looks at all of us , but nobody says a word , and after a moment he just walks off the way he came . Casper watches him go , and when the Scoutmaster is out of sight , he sighs . He puts his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't like touching me . <p> " Show me the can , you stupid shit , " he says , his voice almost gentle . I look up at him with gratitude , but he 's not looking at me . He stands with his hand on my neck but looks at Heitman , who is still at attention , his underwear sagging in front . <p> " Heitman , " he says , " one more time and that 's it . " <p> Casper walks me back along the path to the stone wall , and I point out the can , under its rock . He picks it up , hefts it , and puts it in his pocket . After a moment he sits down on the wall and I sit next to him . He picks up his legs and crosses them under him , his elbows on his thighs , his metal-toed boot tips tucked behind his knees . <p> " Heitman 's crazy , you know , " he says . He stares down the road where the other troop came from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that kid 's crazy . " <p> He looks at me like I should explain , and I know I have to say something . I think of Heitman at the river in the moonlight and say the first thing I think of . <p> " He 's got scars , " I whisper . <p> Casper is quiet for a second . " Where ? " <p> I tell him , and he sighs softly . His shoulders sag , and he closes his eyes , just for a moment . <p> " You know , " he says , " I was thinking of tapping him out tomorrow night . I thought it might be just the thing for him . " <p> " Maybe , " I say . <p> His voice drops low , and his face gets dreamy . " The Indians used to make their boys go out into the wilderness for months , just living off the land . When they came back , they were men . That 's what the Order of the Arrow ceremony is based on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at me sharply . " They look for their spirit guide , " he says . " An animal , like an eagle or a mountain lion , to lead them . Then they become one . " <p> I want to correct him . He does n't know Heitman the way I do . I know what Heitman would do to any animal that tried to lead him anywhere , or become one with him . Instead I say nothing , and Casper shakes his head and looks away from me . A second later he gets up and walks back up the path to camp . I follow him , not too far behind . <p> When we get back to the camp , Heitman is sitting with the seniors , smoking , looking pleased with himself . Casper walks up and takes his cigarette away and throws it into the cooking fire . <p> He walks behind him and looks at his back . I know what he 's looking for , and I ca n't remember for the life of me why I told him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tent and pulls the flaps shut . Chadwell hands Heitman another cigarette , and Heitman lights it directly from the fire , his face nearly in the flames , impressing the hell out of the seniors . When I go to get some wood , I pass close to them , and hear them invite Heitman to spend the night in their tent . He smokes his cigarette and smiles at them all , one at a time . <p> Some time that night , he parts the flaps to my tent . His underwear is gone . I have been awake , expecting him , lying on my back and gripping the sides of my cot . I 've been expecting him because I did not hear him howl . <p> " Come on out , Bergman , " he says . " Let 's go explore . " <p> I say nothing . I lie stiff , not moving , watching him under my eyelids . He crouches in the doorway , one knee up and the other down . <p> " Berrr-gie , " he whispers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chest tight , trying not to breathe . After a moment the tent flaps fall closed , and Heitman is gone . His footsteps blend into the crickets and the bullfrogs and the sound of Old Willy 's television . I lie awake and listen for him , but he does n't come back . <p> When I wake up Friday morning , Heitman is still gone . Disappeared . He is still missing at breakfast . By lunch Casper is cussing , and Old Willy is passing out trail maps to the seniors . Chadwell tosses his in the breakfast fire and laughs , but stops when Casper sticks another one in his chest . " Find him , " he says , " or do n't come back . " He snatches the feathers from Chadwell 's hair . " And get that shit out of here . " <p> The seniors take me with them , almost running down the trail . A quarter mile from camp , they stop as if on a signal and sit on some rocks , begin smoking cigarettes . Garcia offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After about ten minutes , they set off again , slower , and tromp as much around the path as on it . Nobody makes any effort to call out Heitman 's name , or look away from the path . Chadwell walks along breaking off branches , and Garcia strips leaves from everything he touches . What did you dare him to do this time ? I wonder . Did you send him off into the wilderness alone , looking for himself as a man ? Their backs do n't answer me , and we walk on and on . <p> Two hours later we 're back , running the last few hundred yards into the camp . It is abandoned except for Old Willy , who is asleep under the TV tarp . When Casper returns with a ranger , he is bone-rigid with anger ; throughout dinner he is dead silent . Some whisper that the seniors took Heitman out into the woods during the night and abandoned him ; others think he just ran away . By nightfall it becomes possible to believe the boy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Indian ceremony ; I leave the flap open for Heitman , but he does n't come . <p> The woods are black beyond the light thrown by the line of torches . There is no moon , and the wind makes the trees brush up against each other in waves . Our line marches down the side of a ravine . The path is pebbly , and some of the boys slip , reaching out to the man in front , sometimes bringing them both down . On the ground they are kicked by the Indians until they get up . If they try to brush their clothes , they are struck on the shoulders with wooden lances . Porter starts to cry , and two Indians whisk him out of line . Nobody turns to see what happens to him . <p> At the end of the path , at the bottom of the ravine , is a bonfire , and in front of it stands a lone Indian , his arms folded . It is obviously Casper , in leather pants and striped makeup . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up one arm and down the other . His eyes are closed . We line up in front of him and the bonfire . The other troop is lined up on the far side of the fire , standing quietly . Unlike us they are in full uniform  --  their Scoutmaster is also in uniform , and stands to the right of them . They blink and their eyes shift ; one of them raises a hand to wipe his nose . I expect an Indian to rush up and knock the boy to the ground , but nothing happens . Suddenly my head is grabbed from behind and jerked side to side . " Eyes front , " someone hisses in my ear . I smell cigarettes ; I know it 's Garcia , and I stand as still as I can . <p> Casper opens his eyes . He picks up a feathered pole and walks the line of the other troop . He stops and shakes the pole in front of a boy , and one of the other Indians steps up and taps the boy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boy steps forward , and the Indian leads him up to the fire , hands him an arrow . The boy 's face is cold , and he stands with his arms folded , facing his old friends across the clearing , the arrow held diagonally across his chest . <p> Casper has two more boys tapped from the other troop , then starts with us , at the far side from me . My heart begins throbbing , and my body starts to itch , but I can hear the crunch of footsteps behind me , and I can smell Garcia as he passes . I feel my pulse in my fingertips and in my shrunken stomach , and I want to race back to camp where Old Willy is running the generator and watching television . I listen to the progress of Garcia from one end and Casper from the other , one in back and the other in front . <p> Casper shakes his pole , and one of our own is tapped out , one of the older boys . The Indian hits him hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he is ready , one foot slightly back , and the sound of flesh on flesh is so loud it echoes off the trees around us . The troop across the clearing sways in line at the sound , their eyes widening . Our boy walks forward and stands in front of us , his back to the fire . He stares over our heads . <p> Casper taps out one more , then two . He moves down the line and then stops dead in front of me . My heart clenches in my chest , and my breath starts to catch in my throat . I am sure he sees me crying . He looks me in the eye , and his face is too dark to see clearly , but I can see his eyes . They look crazy ; the moisture in them reflects the beating of the bonfire . He stands there , staring at me , his chest rising and falling . He seems to stand there forever . Please , I say to myself , please . I want you to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Heitman smiles at fat Porter . I close my hot eyes when his feet crunch away from me . <p> He reaches the end of the line without again shaking the pole . The Indian behind him takes his place next to the three boys , and Casper walks to the bonfire and turns to face the rest of us  --  the small ones , the ones left over . He raises his arms high up from his sides , eyes squeezed nearly shut , and his chest starts to swell , getting ready to shout at the treetops . Because he is like this , he does n't see Heitman walk slowly into the light of the clearing . When he opens his eyes and sees him , whatever he was thinking of shouting comes out instead as a kind of twisted yelp . His arms fall to his sides like shot birds . <p> Heitman is naked , smeared with mud in streaks across his sides . There is blood on his legs and what looks like shit in his hair . He carries something in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers sticking out this way and that . He is naked , but he walks with his skinny shoulders back , up on the balls of his feet . The way he moves makes the Indians look like school kids lost in the woods in their pajamas . They stare at him  --  next to them , one of the chosen boys drops his arrow in the dirt . Casper , like a deflating balloon , sits down right where he was standing . <p> Heitman has caught a wild turkey , and killed it ; Heitman has caught a wild turkey with his bare hands . He does n't say anything , he just stands and faces us , the turkey in his arms . He looks exhausted ; he looks done in . We glance at each other , and we start to move and shuffle in our places , and just then fat Porter goes and does it . He starts in , and after a second everybody joins him . We stand there , the small ones , all in a line in front of Heitman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We howl , and we howl , and Heitman smiles down the line at us all , one at a time . When he gets to me , his eyes rest only for a second , then drift on past to the next boy . My heart clenches again , but it is too late ; now we are all Heitman 's girlfriend . <p>
