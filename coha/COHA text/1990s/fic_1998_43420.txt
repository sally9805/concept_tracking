Only they call it " teaching me a lesson . " But I wonder what kind of lesson I can learn being in my room . <p> You want to know why I 'm being punished ? <p> I pulled her hair ? <p> Whose hair ? <p> My brand new baby sister 's . Do n't worry , it was only a little pull . I wanted to see what would happen . <p> She started crying of course . " wah ! Wah ! Wah ! <p> And Mom and started came rushing over . Of course . They were pretty upset , too . " What did you do that for ? " Mom was talking to me , but looking at her . <p> " I do n't know . " <p> Mom gave me a long look , and I turned away . <p> Want to know what her name is ? The baby 's , not Mom 's . Rowena . <p> Awful , huh ? I 'd never name a baby Rowena . It 's from Mom 's favorite book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie , Gone With The Wind . See , Mom never forgets anything , even those old books and movies from the dinosaur days . <p> But sometimes I think she forgets me . I mean , that I 'm here . Ever since the baby-OK , Rowena-came , she does n't even drive me to Little League anymore . Yolanda 's mother-she 's our neighbor-drives me . <p> Sure . Mom 's supposed to take it easy because she just had a baby . But I bet if Rowena played Little League , Mom would manage to drive her . <p> The first day they brought her home Dad said , " Be nice to the baby . She 's your little sister . " <p> But I wonder if Rowena is going to be nice to me . I mean , she 's perfect is n't she ? Everyone says so . They touch her little face and say , " She 's perfect . " <p> Aunt Molla said it the first day they came home . she was taking care of me-Aunt Molla was  --  while dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did was give me lunch . An omlet . Yuck . <p> Anyway , I saw Aunt Molla touch the baby 's face . No one saw me standing by the door . And then Aunt Molla said , " This baby 's perfect , just perfect . Let 's hope she never gets diabetes like Melanie . " <p> So now you know . My sister 's perfect . And I have diabetes . That means my body does n't use food the way it 's supposed to . <p> I got it 's a couple of years ago , the diabetes . But it was n't my fault . I mean I did n't want to get it . it just happened . I did n't even know what it was . I just got really sick anddoctor said I have to take insulin injections and check my blood sugar . <p> And I have to change some of the way I eat , too , like I eat mainly sugar-free yogurt instead of ice cream . Actually , they have chocolate sugar-free yogurt , so that 's OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first Mom and Dad were always bending down , hugging me , asking how I felt . But they do n't do that much anymore . They just teach me how to do the shots and fingersticks . Like I say . No fun . <p> They did come to school one day to talk to Ms. Weissberg and Ms. W. told them she would do everything she could to help keep me healthy . Then she hugged me . <p> Then I got Ms. Burns the next year and , well , she 's not as nice as Ms. Weissberg . No hugs . <p> Mom and Dad , they 're not the same either . All of sudden , just because I have a little sister , I 'm supposed to be a big girl . Yuck . I hate those words . " Big girl . " <p> Dad keeps saying them all the time . " You 're a big girl now . " As if I grew up overnight just ' cause we have a new baby . <p> Oh , and you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right . They gave her my clothes . <p> See , Mom keeps-well , kept-this big box of all that pink and white stuff that I grew out of . She used to say they reminded her of when I was a baby . <p> But yesterday she told me they might be good for Rowena . <p> It 's great to be perfect , is n't it ? <p> Oh , hear that ? That 's Mom calling . " Melanie ! You can come out of your room now ! " <p> Maybe I do n't want to come out . Maybe I do n't want to see Aunt Molla . You hear her ? She 's yacking away downstairs again . Boy , she never stays home . <p> She 's probably saying all that stuff about how perfect the baby is , and how she hopes she never gets diabeteslike me . , only now she 's right outside my door . That 's nice . She came all the way upstairs for me . Sometimes my mom does really nice things . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see I was crying , and ask me why . And I 'm not sure . <p> " Why do n't you go out and play ? " Mom still at the door . " I see Yolanda next door . She 's throwing a ball . " Mom 's trying to get me to come out of my room . Maybe she feels bad . It 's such a nice day and I 'm sitting on my bed , like I 'm still being punished . <p> Nothing about the hair pulling , though , so I guess that 's over . <p> OK , so here I am outside and the sun does feel warm . And Yolanda calls me over and starts pitching the ball and slapping her fist into her glove . <p> It 's a baseball so it 's kind of hard , but Yolanda has this leather glove she lends me , so that 's OK . I like catching , but mainly I like pitching . Yolanda says I have a good arm . <p> She knows a lot , Yolanda . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby sister . And she was right . <p> Still , pitching the ball like this is fun . " Yup . You have a real good arm . " That 's Yolanda again . I smile . Then I think of something . Will Rowena have a good arm , too ? <p> Hey , look ! Mom 's putting the stroller in the driveway . Guess they want her to get some sun . <p> " Melanie , keep an eye on Rowena , will you ? " Mom again . And now mom 's going back inside . <p> " It 's a beautiful day , is n't it dear ? " <p> What do you know ? That 's Aunt Molla and she 's talking to me from the porch . Guess they did n't tell her about the hair pulling or she would n't be calling me " dear . " <p> I nod and keep throwing the ball . Guess I should talk to her , but she already knows I 'm not perfect . <p> Heck , now Yolanda 's going in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Me and the baby . <p> Maybe I 'll just go over and look at her . <p> Hey , she 's smiling at me ! Maybe she knows me ... a little bit . <p> " Hi , Melanie . Looking at your sister ? " There 's Dad coming off the porch two steps at a time . <p> I wish he 'd sing to me . Right now . Sometimes he says , " Let 's have a melody for Melanie , " and then he sings something dumb like " Pop Goes the Weasel . " He 's really funny sometimes . <p> He walks up now and hugs me . " You OK ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> " How come you pulled your baby sister 's hair ? " <p> Here it comes . I knew it was n't over . <p> " Do n't know . " <p> " What 's bothering you ? <p> " Oh , Daddy . " I hug him , and his shirt is so soft I press my face against it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about not being perfect , but he 's leaning over the stroller . <p> " Look , " he says . He 's taking her out . <p> Wait . No . I do n't want to hold her . <p> " Here . " He 's handing her to me . <p> No . I do n't want to take her . I put my hands behind my back , but he holds her out to me . " OK , " I whisper . " I 'll try . " <p> I bring my hands around and he sets her in my arms . <p> He 's letting go . Hey , I 'm the only one holding her ! wait a minute ! What if I drop her ? <p> " See , she knows you are her big sister . " dad is all happy now . <p> Her skin is soft , and she 's smiling up at me . Kind of makes me want to cry again . <p> Wait , she 's grabbing my finger . She 's squeezing . <p> Maybe she needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what to do . I give her back to dad and run into the yard . <p> Oh boy , this is n't a good idea , hiding behind the garbage can . It smells . <p> Now I feel sorry that I did n't hold the baby longer . I mean , it 's not her fault she 's perfect . <p> Hey , I 'm tired of sitting here . Are n't they ever going to look for me ? <p> " Melanie ? Please come out . " <p> Mom sounds worried . Sure , I 'll come out . I do n't want to be by this smelly garbage anyway . <p> I step out and walk over to her . Now she 's hugging me . I like it . " What 's wrong , Melanie ? What 's wrong ? " <p> Hey , she 's plopping right down on the grass and taking me on her lap , just like I was a baby too . She 's kissing the top of my head . It feels good . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " What ? " <p> I ca n't stop myself now . It 's all pouring out . " I heard Aunt Molla say the baby is perfect because she does n't have diabetes . " <p> " Oh no . " A tight hug . Hey , I ca n't breathe ! OK , I 'm all cuddly in her lap again . <p> " Aunt Molla did n't mean it the way it sounds . You know she loves you . <p> " And you are perfect . You 're a perfect Melanie . You have brown hair . and brown eyes , and right now you have a sore on your elbow where you fell off your bike . And you have diabetes . <p> " And that 's part of you , too . Maybe some day they 'll find a cure for it , but right now that diabetes is part of you . And all of that makes you perfect . Perfectly you . " <p> " But Rowena is more perfect . She does n't have diabetes . " <p> " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hope she never gets it . No one wants someone to have diabetes , " Mom says , all soft and gentle . <p> " But it is part of you . Just like being a big sister is also part of you now . Just like having two daughters is part of me and Dad . " <p> Wait a minute . I sit up in her lap . I never thought of that . Two daughters . Maybe it 's not so easy to have two daughters , like it 's not so easy to have one sister . <p> Oh , no ! That baby is crying again . Just when things are going great . Mom runs to the baby stroller and I 'm on the grass by myself again . <p> Hey , it 's lonely here . Guess I 'll go over to the stroller , too . I get up and walk over and start to rock it while Mom fixes the blanket . Well , rocking the stroller is n't so bad , I guess . At least she stopped crying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to toss a few ? " <p> Hey , Yolanda 's back . Great . More baseball . I run over to her while Mom pushes the stroller to a sunnier spot on the drive . <p> Then she 's calling . " I 'm going inside . I have something on the stove . I 'll be right back . " <p> Sure . Sure . I play ball with Yolanda . <p> Pitch . Catch . Pitch . Catch . I feel all sweaty . It 's getting windy out . <p> " Too windy to play . " Yolanda is going back into the house again . <p> She holds out her hand for the ball and I raise my arm to throw it , but suddenly she 's screaming , screaming , and pointing . I turn to look . It 's the baby stroller ... the wind is pushing it . It 's rolling down the drive into the street ! <p> Yolanda is still screaming . There 's a car coming , and the stroller is rolling right into it ! If it hits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any baby sister anymore . <p> But even while I 'm thinking , I 'm running , running to the stroller . <p> But I ca n't catch it . I ca n't catch it ! <p> " Stop ! Stop ! " I scream . " Stop ! My baby sister ! " <p> Suddenly I wind up and pitch the ball as hard as I can right against the side of the car . I aim for the door but I hit the window ! The driver shoots his head around to see what happened . He sees me waving my hands over my head and he slams on the brakes . The car screeches to a stop . <p> But the wind is still blowing the stroller into the middle of the street , and Rowena , my baby sister , is wailing . <p> Dad is jumping off the porch and Mom is running out of the house , her hands stretched out as if to grab the baby . <p> I run to the stroller and lift Rowena onto my shoulder the way Mom does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pat her back and she stops crying . <p> I hug her tight , the soft little baby , Rowena , my little sister . <p> I press my cheek against her little face and it 's warm and soft and wet with her little tears . And I whisper , " It 's OK , Rowena . It 's OK . I 'm here . Your big sister . Your perfect big sister . I 'm here , and I 'll take care of you . " <p>
