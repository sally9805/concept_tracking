Section : RETIREMENT " We 're resourceful . We will cope , " say the optimistic Haddens . <p> Okay . You know you should have been saving 10% of your income for retirement every year since you reached age 30 . You should have taken full advantage of tax-deferred retirement accounts and savings plans to build up a portfolio of , say , $500,000 , rather than assuming that Social Security and a pension would provide all of the income you will need once you stop working . But you did n't  --  and retirement is just a few years away . <p> There 's one small consolation : you have plenty of company . Most middle-aged Americans  --  even those with household incomes above $75,000 a year  --  have a hard time putting away much money in the face of hefty mid-life expenses like mortgages , college for the kids , and medical care . " Over 60% of our clients who want to retire comfortably within 10 years wo n't be able to do it  --  unless they make big changes fast , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Personal Financial Services in Waltham , Mass . <p> If you are such a latecomer , someone close to retirement who has n't been putting away enough to finance an acceptable life style , get real-now . " It 's crucial that you spend less and save more , accelerating what you should have been doing all along , " says Robert Preston , a retirement consultant in Danbury , Conn . The belt-tightening may be uncomfortable , but it need not be unbearable . <p> Consider the extreme case of Richard and Barbara Hadden of Cincinnati , age 58 and 62 , respectively . They earn about $80,000 a year and want to retire in three or four years . Using the rule of thumb that retirement income should equal at least 80% of pre-retirement income , the Haddens will need about $64,000 , or roughly $50,000 after taxes , to maintain their standard of living . But they have saved less than a quarter of what they will need to produce that income . <p> People like the Haddens can count on Social Security and pensions to provide only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual pension when she leaves her $40,000-a-year job supervising Cincinnati 's nutrition program for poor mothers and children . And the couple estimate that Social Security will provide $14,000 a year . Any luxuries that are part of their dream retirement will have to come from savings . <p> To date , however , the Haddens have set aside only $105,000 , nearly half of it from a windfall  --  an attorney 's fee that Richard earned by helping to settle a medical malpractice suit in 1987 . Normally he clears no more than $40,000 annually from his law practice . Fortunately , he expects a big fee for another malpractice case this year , about $90,000 , which will leave him $60,000 or so after taxes . He should sock it away , exactly what all latecomers should do with unexpected gains  --  for example , from an inheritance or a generous job-severance package . Even so , the Haddens ' portfolio , most of which is sheltered in tax-deferred IRA and Keogh accounts , would grow to only around $218,000 in four years . <p> The couple have fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifelong reluctance to plan ahead . After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1957 and failing the Ohio bar exam , Richard embarked on a three-decade quest for career fulfillment . He worked for 10 years as a book publishing executive , for five years as an Episcopal priest and finally as a lawyer , hanging out his shingle in 1976 . Along the way , his 23-year first marriage failed , after producing two daughters and a son . Barbara has a similar story . She fell in love with acting while she was a student at Denison University . Upon graduating in 1950 , however , she worked as a salesperson for a record company . She stayed home for four years with her two young sons , took her present job in 1974 , and divorced her first husband two years later . <p> When the Haddens got married in 1983 they had only one major asset , Barbara 's $65,000 house ( which carried two mortgages totaling $47,000 ) . They sold it the next year to buy their present home , a two-bedroom condominium now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading down to a smaller place  --  a bountiful source of cash for many people their age  --  would n't be much help . <p> What 's worse , even as they play catch-up in their retirement planning , the Haddens ca n't seem to stop splurging . They eat out frequently ( cost : at least $3,000 a year ) and have just embarked on their fourth three-week tour of France in eight years ( cost : $3,500 to $4,000 a trip ) . Indeed , after retirement , the couple hope to live for a year or two in France so that Richard can attend cooking school . <p> By the time they retire , the couple intend to have liquidated their investments to pay off all debts , including their $80,000 mortgage . That will cut their fixed expenses to less than $1,500 a month , they say , easily paid from Barbara 's $1,700-a-month income from her pension and Social Security . Her health plan will cover both of them for life  --  an amenity many other retirees lack  --  and extras will come out of Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malpractice cases . " We 're healthy and resourceful , " says Barbara . " We 'll cope . " <p> If you have a similar attitude , listen to what experts think of their plan . " The Haddens are drowning in optimism , " says Helen Stecklein , a retirement adviser in Minneapolis/St . Paul . Another specialist , Cincinnati certified public accountant and financial planner David Foster , estimates that on top of their pension and Social Security , the Haddens must have $726,000 in savings to retire in 1995 and maintain a $50,000-a-year life style . To amass that amount , they would have to work for 10 more years and save $2,500 a month . <p> Alternatively , the Haddens could resign themselves to a retirement life that costs only $34,000 a year in today 's dollars . This 32% reduction in their expenses would reduce the size of the portfolio they 'd need to $240,000 by Foster 's estimate  --  a goal they can reach in four years by saving $400 a month . But , says Stecklein , " they wo n't have much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let alone a cushion for catastrophic illness . " The Haddens are n't concerned about debility sapping their savings though . " There are anti-aging drugs , like human growth hormone , that can keep us healthy , " Richard insists . <p> The best solution may be something in between : if the Haddens work and save $20,500 annually for seven years , they will have an income of $40,000 a year in today 's dollars . <p> In addition , both advisers agree that the Haddens should stop investing aggressively . Although 54% of the couple 's portfolio is in cash , much of the rest is in speculative investments-including a $4,000 flier in 1978 on a jojoba bean grower in Costa Rica . " I 'm pretty sure the shares are worthless now , " says Richard . <p> " They should sell their stocks and small-company funds , " Foster says , " and put 40% to 45% of their capital in less risky funds that invest in large , dividend-paying companies . " Among his favorite funds are Twentieth Century Select ( up 16.3% in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neuberger &; Berman Partners ( up 10.2% ; 800-877-9700 ) . He also recommends that the couple move 35% of their money into a long-term bond fund such as Vanguard Bond Market ( up 12.7% ; 800-662-7447 ) and put the rest in a top-quality money-market fund . Such a portfolio could return 10% or so a year . <p> Damage-control strategies are the only way people like the Haddens can make up for 20 years of missed savings . Confronting the tough choices , Richard confesses : " I 've been thinking of working as a minister again for a few years  --  but now it looks like I might have to do it until I 'm 75 .
