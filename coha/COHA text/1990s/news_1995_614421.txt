<p> Kathy and Phil Coletti first saw their new family on a sonogram seven months ago . <p> Holding out only modest hope for one baby - fertility techniques had n't worked for them in the past - they were stunned when the sonographer circled four pulsing lights , indicating four tiny heartbeats . <p> " We had n't been able to hit the broad side of a barn , " Kathy said . " We never dreamt of four . " <p> On Monday , the Colettis met their babies , born just after 3 p.m. at Northside Hospital . Kathy was awake during the Caesarean section , with half her body numbed by an epidural . <p> Nurses held the two girls close to Kathy 's face as she lay on the operating table . She stroked one tiny , red cheek and then the other , and smiled serenely at their tightly shut eyes . <p> " Phil , " she said . " Have you met these babies ? " <p> " I 've held them , " he said softly , standing nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colettis , married in 1988 , yearned and ached for children . They tried infertility treatments and adoption , but endured heartbreak after heartbreak . In fact , the day before that life-changing sonogram , the mother of a baby they had wanted to adopt told them she 'd chosen another couple . <p> Suggestion of ' reduction ' rejected <p> That 's why they were shocked when , moments after they 'd seen the four heartbeats , the doctors at Reproductive Biology Associates Inc. told them that medically , it would be wise to have " a reduction . " Asked what that meant , they were told they should abort two of the fetuses , or risk losing them all . <p> " Everything up to then had been about creating life , " Phil said . " And all of a sudden , they asked us to go in the opposite direction . It was a hairpin turn . <p> " Our answer was emotional , and it was a quick no .

" You ca n't lie to patients . You have to give them the facts . " <p> On average , quadruplets are born at 29 weeks , weighing only 2 pounds each , said Dr. Jack Huddleston , chief of the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at Emory University School of Medicine . <p> " Their chance of survival at that point is 80 percent , " he said . " And the road to survival is pretty bumpy . " <p> If you " reduce " to two , Huddleston said , the chances of miscarriage or premature delivery of the surviving twins drops to those of a natural twin birth . <p> Some doctors even recommend aborting one fetus when the woman is pregnant with triplets , Huddleston said . But this is more controversial , because the risks are lower . <p> The risks of aborting <p> But there are also risks and difficulties involved in aborting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 percent risk of losing the whole pregnancy . And once the decision is made to reduce , couples usually have to go to another facility , often out of state . Most fertility clinics do not perform abortions . The Colettis were advised to see a doctor in New York . <p> Dr. Ann Patterson-Barnett , a perinatologist at Northside , does n't think reductions are necessary if all the fetuses appear healthy on early sonograms . She has delivered more than a dozen sets of triplets and two sets of healthy quadruplets , including the Coletti babies . <p> " Medically , you can be successful if the patient is motivated , " she said . " It 's not always easy to be hospitalized and away from your husband and undertaking the care of quadruplets . " <p> Quadruplets are extremely rare , but are occurring more frequently because more couples are seeking infertility treatment . Typically , four embryos are implanted and usually only one survives . Less than one percent of families who use assisted-fertilty methods such as in vitro fertilization and drugs will have quadruplets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor must be very careful when advising a couple on their choices , said Dr. Linda Hasty of Emory 's fertility clinic at Crawford Long Hospital . <p> " For the parents , it 's a huge decision - ethically , religiously , morally , " she said . " It 's a huge weight to bear . " <p> A round of applause <p> The Colettis ' two boys and two girls were born at 34 1/2 weeks , just a few weeks shy of a full term . As the last one was carried out of Kathy 's uterus , kicking and crying and full of life , more than 20 hospital staffers crowding the delivery room applauded and wished the children a happy birthday . <p> The Colettis are glad they gambled , but that was a personal choice . Kathy was the product of an unwanted pregnancy , so abortion was unthinkable . <p> " I was adopted , " she said . " My birth mom had the courage to go through the pregnancy , and that has shaped my feelings about abortion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing : There 's nothing their folks would n't do for them . <p> To protect her growing babies , Kathy , 33 , went on disability from her job at Bell South and spent the last five months in bed - three of those months in a hospital bed at Northside . She consumed eight meals a day , adding up to about 6,000 calories - two to three times the calories in an average daily diet . She gained 85 pounds , her belly becoming so gigantic that the 5 1/2-foot woman seemed more wide than tall . <p> Father 's feeling of helplessness <p> Meanwhile , Phil , 44 , an insurance executive , lived alone at the couple 's home in Vinings , nightly visiting his ever-expanding wife and managing the house in her absence . He suffered from a nagging feeling of helplessness : He could hold her hand and be there for her , but he could n't do much more . <p> But through it all , the couple have smiled and cracked jokes and never once complained . Kathy tossed off all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge smile . <p> " We 've always said , no matter how bad it got , it sure beats infertility , " she said . <p> To entertain themselves during the pregnancy , the couple dreamed about the future . <p> " That to me is the fun part , " Kathy said . " To visualize us going to Disney World and going to Washington . " <p> They picture their kids getting their driver 's licenses on the same day , all going through puberty at the same time , and all leaving home at the same time . " We think four siblings are going to have an awful lot of fun together , " Phil said . <p> The dozen or so family members who stood anxiously waiting for news outside the labor and delivery area are anticipating a lot of fun too . <p> " I 'm getting a bigger lap - on purpose !
