MISSED OPPORTUNITY Mme. Chiang Kai-shek , 101 , and her family once held sway over China ; now her old china 's on the block . At an auction of some of her bric-a-brac last week , buyers kept their Jackie fever mostly in check . A bronze automated cathedral clock that was estimated at $8,000 to $12,000 fetched $64,000 , and Mme. Chiang 's bed went for 16 times its presale estimate . But for $50 , someone got her vinyl recliner . And her lazy Susan , priced at $40 to $60 , went for just $5 . Maybe it was n't made in Taiwan .
