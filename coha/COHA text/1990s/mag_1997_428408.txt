Even Hunters Of Timber Rattlers Now Admit That These Snakes Are Shy , Placid  --  And Very Fragile <p> I was in a place I can not identify , with a man I will not name . All I can tell you is that it was somewhere in upstate New York on a chilly day in early May , when the trees were just breaking bud and the forest bore only a thin , gauzy wash of green . Dry oak leaves crunched underfoot as we walked along the top of a ridge , past small , white clumps of blooming anemone and splashes of purplish phlox . It was jacket weather , although the occasional shafts of sunlight through the clouds were enough to warm the rocks of an old , ramshackle stone wall that meandered through the forest . As we approached the wall , my companion pointed with his walking stick . " He ought to be right there . Ease up and see if you can spot him . " <p> The Bellied Viper <p> I crept up slowly and peeked over a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shielded from the wind but exposed to the weak sun , a beautiful timber rattlesnake was coiled . Its **26;597;TOOLONG body was the color of sulfur , a lovely , almost satiny shade of yellow , banded with dark saddles of chocolate . The rear third of the snake deepened to velvet black , ending with a string of 15 horn-colored rattles . Its head was flat and wide , the cat's-pupil eyes overhung by brow scales that gave it ( quite accidentally ) an angry , menacing appearance . In fact , the rattlesnake ignored me completely , although I was only a few feet away . It was undoubtedly aware of my presence , but the meager warmth of the sun was more important , and if I came any closer , it had simply to flow down one of the many gaps in the wall to safety . <p> I can not tell you where I was , or with whom , because the man who took me to see this and other rattle-snakes wants them protected , and fears that disclosing his name or the location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to danger from illegal collectors . Nor is he alone ; I have been sworn to secrecy by many snake hunters and researchers , threatened with blindfolds ( and worse ) before they would take me to their favorite dens and basking rocks , and admonished with stories about sites that were cleaned out by poachers because someone had a loose tongue . <p> Welcome to the secretive  --  one might say slightly paranoid  --  world of those who study timber rattlesnakes . Yet the paranoia is sometimes justified ; this once-common reptile is vanishing at an alarming rate across much of its formerly wide range , the victim of habitat loss and fragmentation , zooming cars , unscrupulous collectors , and those who react to the sight of any snake by reaching for a gun or stick . Today , the timber rattlesnake is gone entirely from three states and is on the threatened or endangered lists of at least ten others , especially in the Northeast . Only in the central Appalachians and Ozarks is the species reasonably secure  --  and even there , biologists foresee a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pit vipers , a highly evolved group that also includes the copperheads and the cottonmouths , as well as such tropical species as the bushmaster and the fer-de-lance . There are 30 species of rattlers , half of which are found in the United States , mostly in the Southwest ; Arizona alone has 12 different kinds . But the timber rattlesnake , Crotalus horridus , is the only rattler in much of its range , which extends from Oklahoma and Nebraska up the cool and misty Appalachians to southern New England , and along the rocky bluffs of the Mississippi to Wisconsin and Minnesota . ( A more plentiful subspecies , the canebrake rattler , is found along the Eastern coastal plain from Texas to the extreme southeast section of Virginia . ) <p> Although some scientists lump the timber rattler and the lowland canebrake together as one species , they are physically and ecologically different . Timber rattlers come in a variety of colors , called phases or morphs , ranging from a clear golden yellow through various browns to nearly coal black , although even yellow-phase snakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phases were a sign of gender , but that is not true . They are , however , tied to habitat  --  the black snakes tend to use shadier , more heavily forested habitat , where dark pigment may help these cold-blooded animals blend in and absorb scant sunlight for warmth . <p> Timber rattlers are creatures of the mountains and forests , and while they spend most of their time hidden deep in the woods , they are most often encountered by humans on rocky outcroppings or ledges  --  the famous " snake dens " of the Appalachians , where pregnant female rattlers gather to bask in the sun , a kind of mobile incubator . I saw my first rattlesnake in just such a place , when I was about 13 years old . I was fishing with two school chums in the mountains of northern Pennsylvania , taking a break on a boulder-strewn slope to eat lunch , when my friend Lloyd reached for what he thought was a heavy stick . Instead he yelped and scrambled back as the " stick " coiled and began an angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , and I am ashamed to say I know exactly how long it was because we bludgeoned it to death and took it back to show our parents . Even then I knew it was wrong  --  I was an aspiring amateur herpetologist , after all  --  but I was caught up in the sort of lynch mob mentality that often oozes to the surface when a venomous snake is seen . <p> A mother and recently born timber rattlers coil up together . The family will soon disperse , and the infants  --  armed with full venom glands  --  will start hunting for small rodents . <p> Twenty-five years later , I found myself just a few miles from the scene of my childhood shame , trying to keep up with Curt Brennan and Mike Machmer . It was a sultry day in early August , humid and close , and we were panting up a steep mountainside  --  or at least , I was panting ; my companions , who do this sort of thing all the time , were not . At last we reached level ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fern , laurel and blueberries . Brennan , a solidly built man with a clipped gray mustache and steel-rimmed glasses , led the way , while Machmer  --  shorter , wirier , with a full black beard  --  brought up the rear . Both carried wooden sticks tipped with stout metal hooks , the emblem of serious snake hunters . <p> We stopped eventually near a large outcropping of gray sandstone , a ledge that was , to my eye , identical to half a dozen others we 'd passed without a second glance . Brennan moved more carefully now , stepping lightly as he threaded a path through the underbrush . I followed him , walking as nearly in his footsteps as I could , until we were within a few yards of the boulders . <p> Using his stick , Brennan parted the laurel in front of us . Instantly , a harsh , insect-like buzzing filled the air , like the dry sound of summer cicadas , and what looked like a pile of leaves began to move . More than two dozen rattlesnakes were basking in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a card table , and as they sensed danger they began to separate and back away , toward the safety of deep , protective holes beneath the rock . <p> Twenty years ago , Curt Brennan would have been wading into the melee , snatching snakes with his hook and stuffing them into collecting bags , flushed with the danger and excitement of rattler hunting . He was good at it , too ; in 1977 , Brennan and a friend captured the " most snakes " prize at the venerable Morris , Pennsylvania , rattlesnake hunt by hauling 70 timber rattlers down from the mountains . But not long thereafter , Brennan underwent a change of heart . Far from being the vicious , menacing creatures that most people believe them to be , timber rattlers , Brennan began to realize , are shy , retiring and exceptionally fragile , easily injured by the rough handling they receive in capture . What 's more , he found that rattlers were disappearing from many of the haunts where they 'd once been common . Believing them dangerous , most people killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as to force them out of their underground re-treats with gasoline fumes or the acrid smoke from road flares  --  even using crowbars and hydraulic truck jacks to pry apart the ledges where generations of snakes had sought safety . <p> Today , Brennan , 45 , still hunts for rattlesnakes but only to observe them . A forest maintenance supervisor with the state Bureau of Forestry , he has become an eloquent spokesman for the snakes , even writing a book , Rattler Tales from Northcentral Pennsylvania , about his conversion from hunter to advocate . He also symbolizes the public 's slowly changing attitudes to-ward these slender , graceful hunters . <p> " This is basically a placid and peaceful animal , " Brennan said . " I ca n't stand being a fake , and I was helping to perpetuate a lie by portraying myself as a rough , tough saver of mankind by rounding up rattlesnakes . And I knew that the snake population was in trouble if I , and others like me , continued to do what we were doing . Just by getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very short time , you learn that they 're not what people have led you to believe they are . If you give yourself two minutes to calm down , you 'll learn that the animal is n't out to get you  --  it 's out to get away from you . " <p> Rattlesnakes have long held a mingled dread and fascination for us . In the Eastern part of the country many Indian tribes venerated them , referring to rattlesnakes as " Grandfather " and treating them with respect . The Colonists did not follow suit . The " belled viper " was one of the more sensational finds in the New World , and almost everyone agreed that the serpents were unspeakably evil , and should be killed on sight . " Our Trained Bands in some of our Countrey towns . . . carry on a War with the Snakes , and make the killing of them , part of their Discipline , " wrote Massachusetts Puritan Cotton Mather in 1712 . Benjamin Franklin called rattlesnakes " Felons. . . from the Beginning of the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the famous Gadsen flag with its " Do n't Tread on Me " warning to Great Britain . <p> Battle emblem or no , the snakes were killed whenever they were en-countered . John Bartram , the otherwise mild-mannered Quaker botanist , was crossing the mountains north of his home in Philadelphia in 1751 when he encountered a timber rattler . " We were warned by a well known alarm to keep our distance from an enraged rattle snake that had put himself in a coiled posture of defense , within a dozen yards of our path , but we punished his rage by striking him dead on the spot . " Others took the battle to the enemy . In the early 19th century George Catlin , who went on to fame as a painter of Western Indians , wiped out a den in northeastern Pennsylvania by tying a powder horn to the tail of a rattler , lighting a fuse and letting the snake escape into the rocks , towing the bomb behind it . <p> Myths grew up around the reptiles , each more bizarre and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are simply hollow , overlapping sections of keratin , the same stuff as fingernails , do not mark the snake 's age . ( They get a new segment each time they shed their skins , several times a season , and lengths of the rattle break off easily . ) Rattlers do not always warn before they strike , nor do they hypnotize their prey . They do not live in pairs , and if you kill one , the mate will not seek you out for vengeance . ( In fact , females may not even need a mate to reproduce . ) Colonists claimed the venom was so virulent that a man who killed a snake with a wooden switch later scratched his head with the stick and died . <p> Stretchable skin and a lower jaw that extends both down and out allow a timber rattler to swallow a supersize meal . <p> The 20th century has been no kinder to the timber rattlesnake . The killing became more methodical  --  and more permanently effective , as rattler populations were fragmented into smaller and increasingly vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists the timber rattler as endangered , once paid contractors to dynamite rattlesnake dens to smithereens . Until recently , many states , counties and local municipalities paid bounties , shelling out cash for each rattle-tipped tail that was turned in . A few folks became professional snake hunters , like the man in Minnesota who killed thousands over the years for the bounty . And as paved roads threaded the mountains , speeding cars killed more of the slow-growing reptiles than could easily be replaced by annual reproduction . <p> Stephen Harwig started observing rattlesnakes in the 1930s as a teenager in western Pennsylvania . Although he is not a biologist , Harwig has earned an unmatched reputation for his knowledge of rattlesnake habits and today , at age 76 , still studies his favorite animal with undiminished energy . When he started , rattlers were common , enjoying a boom that followed the massive logging of the northern mountains at the turn of the century ; the snakes thrived in the brushy second-growth stands of aspen , birch and huckleberries . But since then , as the forest matured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen den after den ruined by killers and collectors . <p> " The rattlesnakes had their heyday back in the 1930s and ' 40s , " Harwig told me as he , Curt Brennan and I combed a rocky slope in northern Pennsylvania for rattlers . " Then they got hit hard in the 1950s and ' 60s , so that now they 're down to 5 or 6 percent of what they were , and they just seem to be barely holding on . " <p> Brennan and I found a half-dozen snakes , ranging from babies less than a foot long to adolescents . But it was Harwig who made the prize find  --  a handsome 45-inch black-phase rattler , the biggest snake of the day , tucked back in a cleft of the rocks . After admiring it from a distance , we left it undisturbed . <p> In parts of the Northeast , the situation has grown so grave for the timber rattler that there have been efforts to protect it under the federal Endangered Species Act , which has far more clout than state laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the top rattlesnake experts in the country , both in and out of government , are working on a Conservation Action Plan , or CAP  --  a blueprint for identifying the threats to the rattler 's future , and a guide to counteracting those hazards for state and federal agencies . <p> " It 's a formidable task , because the rattler is so far gone in so many places already , " said Earl Possardt , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist who is coordinating the CAP effort . Among the 30 states that once had timber rattlers , Maine , Michigan and Rhode Island no longer do , and 20 states have seen population de-clines of 50 percent to well over 90 percent , he said . " New Hampshire has just one surviving population . Vermont has three ; Massachusetts , six or seven . Nebraska has three populations left , I believe . Of the 7 states that remain , only maybe 4 or 5 "  --  Virginia , West Virginia , Kentucky , Missouri and Arkansas  --  " still look good . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decline , not restore the rattle-snake to areas where it 's been extirpated . Realistically  --  both biologically and politically  --  that would n't be possible , " Possardt admitted . <p> In Pennsylvania , the timber rattler has been at the center of controversy for years , with conservationists pitted against organizers of the eight or ten annual snake hunts , held in small towns like Morris and Cross Fork in the rugged , heavily forested northern mountains . The state considers the timber rattler a candidate for its endangered species list , said Andrew Shiels , nongame biologist with the state Fish and Boat Commission . In recent years , Shiels said , the agency has clamped down on the hunts  --  limiting each hunter to just two rattlers , mandating that the snakes be released after the hunt at the place of capture and banning their use in " sacking contests " in which teams of hunters in an enclosure race to grab and bag as many as possible . ( Sponsors now import out-of-state reptiles for the sacking competition . ) <p> Scientists who have studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would like to see the carnivals phased out . Rattlesnakes are surprisingly fragile , and herpetologists contend that a large percentage of the snakes eventually die from the trauma of being caught . The survivors , they say , are often dumped far from their home territories , resulting in disorientation and death . And because the hunters frequently nab pregnant females exposed on basking ledges , rattlesnake populations in Pennsylvania are heavily skewed toward males . By one estimate , fewer than a quarter of all dens have the eight to ten breeding-age females needed for long-term survival . <p> Ironically , just as the belled viper is disappearing from many of its ancestral haunts , scientists have begun to appreciate the complex lives timber rattlesnakes lead . Almost everything about rattlesnake ecology , it turns out , makes the creatures vulnerable to humans  --  such as their positively glacial reproduction rate . Biologist William Brown of Skidmore College , in Saratoga Springs , New York , has been studying the species since 1978 and has found that a typical female timber rattler in the Northeast does not breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every three or four years thereafter . Litters are small , usually just eight or nine babies that are born alive around Labor Day . Even though rattlesnakes can be long-lived  --  up to 25 years  --  most females only have the chance to breed once or twice in their lives , Brown discovered . <p> Pregnant females seek basking sites where they can move from shade to sun and back again , maintaining an even body temperature for the benefit of their embryos . Through this long summer pregnancy , the females do not hunt , reserving most of the space in their tubular bodies for their growing offspring . Because basking sites are used year after year , " snake dens " may become locally well known , and someone with a gun , a club and a grudge can kill a large percentage of the mature , breeding females in a population with just a couple of visits . <p> As with the choice of basking sites , tradition rules other aspects of a rattlesnake 's life . Perhaps the most critical is where to spend the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl several feet underground to get below the frost line , and it must choose a winter den , or hibernaculum , with damp air if it is to avoid fatal dehydration . Many dens in the central Appalachians , researchers have found , are in mature forests with a thick , insulating cover of leaves on the ground ; logging may render the den site useless . Dens are also often close to small springs , where the ground is saturated with water , ensuring that the snakes wo n't dry out . <p> There is evidence that young rattlers , born just weeks earlier , follow the scent trails of adults to winter dens , thus learning the way . Grown rattlers moved far from their home territory may simply wander in circles for months until they freeze , even though local dens are available . Apparently just any old den wo n't do ; it must be their den , the one they 've used since infancy , and recent genetic work suggests that the snakes in each den form something of an ex-tended family , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that all these traits make reintroducing rattlesnakes to areas where they 've been eliminated , or even restocking places with declining populations , extremely difficult . ) <p> Timber rattlesnakes are , in fact , full of surprises . Earlier this year , scientists announced that a captive female timber rattler had given birth  --  even though she had been separated from males since her own birth 14 years ago . Such fatherless reproduction , called parthenogenesis , occurs in some lizards , fishes and insects , but it had never been clearly documented before in rattlesnakes , said animal behaviorist David Chiszar of the University of Colorado , who owns the rattlesnake . What 's more , parthenogenesis usually results in female babies , while these were all male . While Chiszar and his colleagues have theories about how the snake pulled off the feat , no one is sure exactly how the process works , or what triggers it . <p> Much of what is known about timber rattler ecology dates from just the past 20 years , thanks to advances in electronic monitoring . In the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern Pennsylvania when I ran into a bearded , somewhat scruffy man slowly waving what looked like a small television antenna over his head . This is the sort of encounter that makes a hiker wish he 'd taken a different trail , but this fellow was n't a lunatic , he was a scientist  --  Howard Reinert , one of the first biologists to implant tiny radio transmitters in rattlesnakes and follow them through their daily lives . <p> Now a professor at the College of New Jersey near Trenton , Reinert continues to study timber rattlers , but he has shifted his attention from the mountain dwellers to the small , endangered population that inhabits the Pine Barrens . These lowland snakes live very different lives from their mountain cousins , basking beside sand roads instead of on rock ledges and wintering in old stump holes deep in white cedar swamps . One day last June , I joined Reinert and student Gylla MacGregor as they made the rounds through a jungle of scrub oak , pitch pine and bogs to check on six rattlesnakes they were monitoring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire in a quarter-century had swept through part of their study site , charring 20,000 acres . Because the snakes were still in their hibernacula when the fire struck , none of them were killed , Reinert told me as we followed a meandering deer trail  --  and it provided a great opportunity to see how those in the burned section would fare , compared with rattlers in the unburned portion . " That 's what was so fortuitous . I could n't have planned a better study , " he said . <p> The first year , Reinert and a colleague found , the rattlesnakes in the burned zone had to cling to what little cover was left , such as regenerating clumps of mountain laurel . But they did n't strike out for lusher surroundings . " Rattlesnakes are long-lived animals that become well established , and they develop a fairly strong affinity for a site , " he said . " They seem to get locked into an activity range  --  they know it , they use it , and they seem extremely reluctant to change it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The snakes ' patience seems to have paid off . Now there was little visible sign that a fire had roared through this area . The laurel and scrub oak had regrown into almost impenetrable thickets , and even the blackened trunks of the pitch pines were sprouting tufts of green needles . More import-ant , the place was again full of white-footed mice , red-backed voles , chipmunks and other small mammals  --  the favorite prey of timber rattlers . <p> A rattlesnake is one of the most sophisticated hunters in the animal world . Although it is , like all snakes , deaf to airborne sound , its vision is acute , and it can sense even delicate vibrations through the ground . Its constantly flicking tongue picks up odor molecules from the air and deposits them in a sensory organ on the roof of the mouth . What 's more , the facial pits that give the pit vipers their name are exquisitely sensitive heat receptors , able to distinguish differences of a fraction of a degree  --  like the difference between a warm mouse and the cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , timber rattlers set a careful ambush , using their tongues to " taste " fallen logs until they find one that mice have been using as a runway . The snake coils beside the log , its head at a right angle to it and its lower jaw resting lightly upon the wood . Then the rattler waits , for days if necessary ; snakes have a slow metabolism , and may only eat once every week or two . The snake may even sleep behind its lidless , staring eyes , but eventually the faint vibrations of a scampering deer mouse jolt it awake . Information from the facial pits and eyes merge to paint a picture of the advancing mouse . A blindingly fast strike delivers a massive dose of venom through the hollow , syringe-like fangs , and the mouse leaps away . A few minutes later the snake , relying on its flicking tongue to bring in the scent of the now-dead rodent , tracks it down and begins to eat . <p> The venom , an exotic brew of complex enzymes , is a hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , of course , why rattlesnakes are so widely feared . Rattlers can and do kill people , but not as frequently as you might think . Of the nearly 8,000 venomous snakebites each year in the United States , only a dozen or so result in death  --  in part because a large percentage of bites are " dry "  --  that is , the snake chooses to inject little or no venom . ( This is also why so many far-out snakebite remedies seem to work . ) <p> Relatively few of those bites are , in the parlance of health statisticians , legitimate , the result of an accidental encounter with a wild snake . Most come from people handling , catching , playing with , showing off around , trying to kill or otherwise goofing off with a venomous snake . More than 70 people have died in this century , largely in the southern Appalachians , as a result of handling snakes during religious services . What 's more , most of the snakebite fatalities in the United States involve the larger or more potently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eastern and western diamondback rattlers . <p> " Look , " said Shiels about his home state of Pennsylvania , " we have a population of 12 million people , and out of that we have one or two venomous snakebites a year . And I do n't know when we 've had a fatality  --  certainly not since we 've been keeping records in the past 10 or 20 years . " <p> Timber rattlesnakes , Reinert and other researchers say , usually take a live-and-let-live attitude toward humans , as I found out myself . We were following MacGregor , who was swinging a radio antenna from side to side , sweeping the ground around her , trying to locate No. 940207 , a two-foot-long male . " I know he 's here somewhere , " she said , stopping and backtracking a few feet . " He was right under this laurel bush yesterday . " <p> " Look there , Gylla , " Reinert said with a slight smile , pointing to a spot near her left foot . The yellow-phase snake , cryptic against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her boot . It never moved , never rattled , never made the slightest sign of anger or alarm . Later in the day , we all unwittingly walked within two feet of a thick 45-incher that did n't stir a muscle in protest , even when Reinert knelt beside it to slide a thermometer next to its coils . <p> " I 've encountered literally thousands of snakes over the past 20 years , and I can count on one hand the number of times I 've been rattled at , " Reinert said . Legend and misconceptions aside , he said , the timber rattler is a fairly docile animal , remarkably tolerant of humans  --  certainly far more tolerant than we have been of it . <p> Still , it 's a hard sell to convince the general public that rattlesnakes are valuable members of the environment . Even in states where the snakes have legal protection and hefty fines are levied for killing them , natural resource agencies recognize the need to make concessions to homeowners who might not want venomous snakes crossing their yards . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will promptly come and move the snake to another , nearby location . In New York , researchers have worked with homeowners to design low , snake-proof fences to keep the rattlers out of yards . <p> Yet Reinert , Brennan and others sense a softening of public attitudes toward rattlesnakes . " I think it 's similar to the wolf , " Shiels said . " Wolves represent wilderness , and maybe timber rattlesnakes represent wilderness to some people  --  they certainly do to me . You do n't find them in strip malls ; they 're an animal that does n't live very well with people and needs wild places to survive . " <p> While the debate over rattlesnake hunts attracts public attention , the greater threats to timber rattlers are more insidious  --  especially habitat destruction and fragmentation . In southern New England and the Middle Atlantic states , housing developments chew ever deeper into rattle-snake country , chopping ancestral territories into pieces . In the Pine Barrens , the snakes have been isolated in widely separated areas , and there is evidence that they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inbreeding . And while Reinert 's study site is a protected state wildlife area , it is crisscrossed by sand roads that are used as shortcuts by local drivers . The pregnant female rattlers often bask beside the roads , where a number are hit each year  --  and Reinert is especially concerned now that big , gravel-hauling tractor-trailers have begun using the routes . Several times , as we sat in the shade of the cedars beside a quiet creek for lunch , the earth rumbled as another of the behemoths thundered by . " Our biggest recommendation to the state was that they close off these sand roads . We 've tried to get the town to do it , but they wo n't go for it , " he said . <p> Meanwhile , there 's a great deal left to be discovered . For instance , how does a rattlesnake unerringly navigate , across miles of tangled terrain , from its winter den to hunting territory to basking sites ? Does it use scent , or the earth 's magnetic field ? Polarized light , visual landmarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has found that young rattlesnakes in the Pine Barrens sometimes shadow their older counterparts , following their movements as if to learn the best locations for food or denning . One possibility is that the young snakes are following their own fathers  --  quite a feat of kin-recognition , since male rattlers play no role in reproduction after mating and are long gone by the time the young are born a year later . <p> " That 's fascinating in an animal that we usually think of only as an eating machine . But there 's more going on in their heads than hunting , " Reinert said . " You know , "  --  he looks slightly embarrassed  --  " I talk to them when I 'm alone . I know they ca n't hear me , but it 's a matter of respect  --  I 've come to know them as individuals , with their own characteristics and idiosyncrasies . I 'm truly grateful to them for the in-formation and entertainment they 've provided me over the years .
