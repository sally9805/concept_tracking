It was still dark when Stuart carried his suitcase out to the car . The streetlights glowed in single file up and down the block , and it seemed to him that their slender necks were bending beneath the weight of each bulb . He breathed deeply , and the feeling reminded him of church and afterwards , when you walked outside into the bright Sunday morning and knew you were capable of only good things . A small shape floated across the windshield and onto the hood of the car . A leaf , he thought , but when he touched it his fingers sank into the soft startled wetness of a frog . He drew back and wiped his hand on his jeans . Now he could hear a few birds twittering in the bushes , and the sound was like whispers , like the snickering of girls at school . <p> In the house , his mother was leaning over the cluttered bathroom sink , pressing rouge to her cheeks with a special round pad . She had told him to dress simply : worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had explained , was what his father would be wearing . But she had risen two hours earlier to put on a dress and fix her hair . Tiny gold crosses glittered from her ears . <p> " You about ready ? " Stuart asked , trying not to sound impatient , because if he did , it would make her take even longer . <p> " My bags are in the kitchen , " she said without moving her mouth . " You can take them on out , I 'll be right there . " She puffed up her cheeks , dabbed more rouge onto the pad . He noticed how her shoulders poked forward beneath her thin cotton dress , and he wished she would put on a sweater ; he wished she would be more careful when she drove , and that she would take vitamins regularly . She was the only person he had ever loved , and he worried that God would take her from him . Stuart was fourteen , and he was afraid that he loved his mother too much . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a whiff of an almost-familiar scent , that meant night had changed into early morning . He arranged his mother 's suitcases beside his own and slammed the trunk , hoping she would hear the sound and understand how ready he was to go . He had only been out of Maine twice before , and that was just to New Hampshire , and he thought he could n't bear to stay in this state , in this town , in this cramped , gray yard , for one moment longer . Mosquitoes descended on him then , and though he could n't see them , he heard their insistent whining , felt their wings brush against his arms and neck . He got in the car and closed the door and pulled his seatbelt over his lap , and by the time he looked up , his mother was coming , moving sleek and steady as a cat . She did not wear shoes with less than a three-inch heel , yet her feet always hit the ground squarely when she walked . She sounded like a ticking clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd married his father , Stuart 's mother had n't taken any pride in her appearance . I did n't bother to keep myself up , she 'd told him on the eve of her thirtieth birthday , curling her fingers to examine the fresh plum coat on her nails . They were sitting on the front steps , the uncut cake between them-chocolate , with butter-creme swirls . Stuart 's mother struck a match off her thumbnail ; she repeated the act until Stuart could do it too , and then she clapped as his flame licked the tops of the candles , one by one . Across the street , the neighbor 's dogs stopped pacing the chain-link fence that enclosed them and stared , panting , at the quiet burst of light . Later that evening , she showed him the photographs she 'd kept , she said , so that I 'll never forget . In each one she looked more painfully thin , her hair lackluster and matted like fur , her breasts no more than a wrinkle , her mouth a wide , angry curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him . Drugs , men . It did n't matter . Stuart was ten , and he believed he understood exactly what she meant . <p> Now , when she opened the car door , a dozen metal bracelets quarreled on her wrists . She was capable-looking , and pretty , the head secretary and receptionist at their church . " If you 're nervous , " she told Stuart , lifting her long legs into the car , " do n't be . " <p> " I 'm not , " he said , but he knew she would n't believe him . Stuart could not even remember what his father looked like . Ten years ago , his father had abandoned Stuart and his mother along with The Church of Christ 's Love where he was junior pastor , and except for sporadic child support , they had n't heard from him in a long time . Now he had written to say that he wanted to put things right . He had gone back to school and was living with a woman from ohio . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself married in his heart , and he wanted Stuart to think of Miriam as his stepmother , and their little girl , Mars , as his sister . He hoped Stuart 's mother would understand that , though God was no longer a part of his life , he respected her beliefs and , if Stuart were to visit , would do nothing to contradict them . This was the reason Stuart 's mother was driving him all the way to Massachusetts , to the old farmhouse his father and Miriam were fixing up . Stuart was to win his father 's heart back to Christ . His mother would continue on to New York State , where she 'd stay with her old friend Emily , but she would return to pick him up at the end of the visit , which was supposed to last a week . <p> It was the little girl , Stuart 's mother said , whom she felt the most sorry for . Poor thing , raised by hippies , not even given the comfort of a Christian name . That 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of God 's love . Stuart imagined Mars as an ashen-faced , wispy child , her eyes deep with longing . When she saw him for the first time she would stand up very slowly and walk over to him step by jolting step , drawn by the gossamer fingers of the Holy Spirit . He would baptize her right on the spot with water from the vial he 'd hidden in his pocket , and she 'd lick the droplets from around her mouth greedily , a traveler just emerging from a wide and terrible desert . <p> But actually , Stuart was n't sure what to expect . It would be the first time he had witnessed alone , and as they pulled out of the driveway , he felt that he was about to be changed in some mysterious and unalterable way . It was a feeling he had frequently , though nothing ever seemed to happen as a result . His mother said it was God tapping lightly on his shoulder , a test to see if he was listening , to see what he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meant that Stuart had Grace , but Stuart suspected he had only emptiness , and this was his most shameful secret . He saw his life as a series of complex imitations , all of which were performed exactingly , but without understanding . And like any impostor , he was afraid of being exposed only slightly more than he was afraid he would never be discovered . <p> His mother flicked on the radio . " Who 's my best sweetheart ? " she asked . <p> " I am , " he said automatically . They were heading south on 95 , the humped shoulders of the pine forests beginning to glisten as the sun rose over the ocean . Gulls drifted high above them , singly , calling as if they were lost . Crossing the bridge from Maine into New Hampshire , the interstate lights winked out in waves , and for awhile Stuart and his mother kept pace , reaching each new section of lights just in time to watch them fade from gold to white . <p> When they had driven as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area to get something to eat . The sun had burned away the morning haze and now , in the heat , the interstate traffic sounded angry and huge , like a single soulless creature . It was difficult to imagine that each car was driven by an individual person , that each person was driving for a specific reason to a specific place where there would be more individual people , each with lives of their own . Stuart was afraid he would never have enough love in his heart to encompass them all , and for this he would be held accountable . He felt an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia , walking beside his mother into the restaurant , standing in line to order burgers and sodas and salty fries . <p> " It 's strange to be away on a Saturday , " his mother said , wrestling napkins from the dispenser on the counter . " It does n't feel right somehow . " <p> Every summer since Stuart could remember , they had spent Saturday afternoons with other members of The Church of Christ 's Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood , inviting people to come to Sunday services . They canvassed Portland and the surrounding , smaller towns : Saco , old orchard Beach , Biddeford , Gorham . Before going out on the route Pastor Hardy set for them , they 'd meet at somebody 's house for potluck and rich , creamy desserts . Afterwards , they 'd form a Circle of Prayer , joining hands and asking God to help them to be His Messengers , His voice on earth . Sometimes , individual members would ask for a specific intention . Stuart asked again and again that God help him not to feel embarrassed , especially when somebody his own age answered the door , especially when it was someone he recognized from school . He knew he should make his petition out loud , but he was afraid of hurting his mother , for this was something she believed he still enjoyed the way he did when he was five and six and seven , still clinging to her hand . <p> And it had been fun , riding in the back of the van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors and racing up the street ahead of the adults to tell them if it looked like anyone was home . At the door , the smallest child would be lifted up to ring the bell while the others held the slippery stacks of pamphlets , smiling brightly . Show your joy , Pastor Hardy said , for faith was a lit candle , something that should shine for all to see . Stuart and the other children tried their best to act joyful while the adults spoke in low , polite voices to the person who answered the door . If that person was a woman , the women in the group spoke first , putting her at ease , making it clear they were mothers themselves , the sort of people you could open your door to without fear . If the person who answered the door was a man , then the men in the group stepped forward , their arms bent into crisp right angles , because often a man would shake hands automatically , and after shaking hands with someone , it becomes more difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then he watched his mother as she nibbled the tips of her fries , stuffing them back , half-eaten , into the package if they were n't perfectly crisp . She made Stuart laugh by twisting the paper wrapper at one end of her soda straw and blowing through the other . The wrapper shot off the straw and hit him in the chest . " Bull's-eye , " she said , and he reached for his own straw , but he 'd already removed the wrapper and scrunched it into a ragged wad . Some little boys at the next booth were staring ; Stuart 's mother fluttered her fingers at them , and they ducked behind the high orange seat . Stuart was suddenly , wildly happy . He wished he and his mother could just keep on driving forever , stopping at restaurants whenever they were hungry , camping at night beneath the wide white eyes of the stars . on the road , day after day , week after week , his life would be shaken into place until everything fit together into the snug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Pastor Hardy promised , his eyes would be truly opened . He would see beyond the surface shapes of things and understand their meaning , and he would be able to love the world the way Christ 's teachings required . When kids at school teased him , when girls giggled behind their hands as he passed them in the halls , he would forgive them , for he would realize that what his mother had told him was true : they were envious , bound to the world as they were . They were jealous of his faith . He should smile kindly and move on , and from now on that 's exactly what he would do . <p> Thinking of this , he followed his mother back to the car eagerly and with great hope . But the traffic sounded the same , and the sun was uncomfortably warm , and soon they were gliding off the turnpike and into the countryside without anything having changed . Stuart closed his eyes , worrying about what he would say to his father and stepmother . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed , that the Spirit would move him to say the right things . He was afraid that all his life he would have to pretend the way the foreign exchange students at school pretended , nodding their heads in all the right places without understanding anything you said . <p> His mother began talking about how much she looked forward to seeing Emily , whom she 'd known since they were both sixteen , cutting classes at the same high school Stuart attended now . It was Emily who 'd introduced Stuart 's mother to his father , saying , You ought to talk to this guy , he 's crazy , he says he 's going to be a preacher someday . But now Emily was a Christian too , married to a Christian man . <p> " Your father had an amazing voice , " his mother said . " Like music , people listened to it , listened and wanted more . It did n't even matter what he said as much as how he said it . It was a gift , like speaking in tongues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a walk and I cried for hours . He said it was the poison washing out of me . " <p> Stuart did n't know what to say . " What 's Emily like ? " he finally asked . His mother laughed . " She 's a firecracker . You met her once before she moved away . " <p> " I remember . " <p> " You were just a baby . " <p> " I remember it , " Stuart insisted , and his mother laughed and made a face at him , but she did not contradict . <p> They arrived at the farmhouse early in the afternoon ; Stuart 's mother stopped the car at the foot of the long dirt drive . It ran at least a quarter of a mile up to the farm which had once belonged just to Miriam , but now belonged to his father too . His father had written to Stuart about the meadow flowers and the tiny wandering stream and the chicks he had ordered from a catalog . Miriam , he said , had plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help lay in a fence . He could hike into the Berkshires . He could stay as long as he wished . The letter was signed , Love , instead of In His Love , the way his father used to sign his letters when he was junior pastor . <p> " Are n't you going to come in ? " Stuart said , but his mother shook her head . High overhead , two hawks circled and circled as if the car below them were prey . <p> " I do n't want to see him , " she said . " You do n't know . what that would do to me . " <p> " I do n't want to go by myself . " <p> " I would say terrible things if I saw that man . Things I do n't want on my conscience . " She leaned over and pressed her forehead to Stuart 's cheek , and he smelled the medicinal odor of her hair spray . " Do n't be mad with me . " <p> " Mom , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Pastor Hardy , that he probably did n't have Grace after all , that Jesus had become an echo of a word that he remembered but could no longer say without blasphemy . He wanted to say that he loved only her , and if she wanted him to do this , he would do it , but not for God . <p> " Your father gave me the most precious things I have , " she said . " He gave me my faith , and he gave me you . " She straightened up and got out of the car and opened up the trunk . " Now I 'm about to repay that debt . " <p> This was even worse than what he felt as he got older , going door to door all those Saturday afternoons wearing stiff clean clothes , a smile pressed to his face , and all the while wondering what was going to happen next . Mostly people just shook their heads and closed their doors , but others would tell them to go to hell , drop dead , piss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallet . A couple stood in their doorway , naked and drunk and laughing . A woman ignored the adults completely and bent her heads close to the children . Are they treating you OK ? she had asked . Are they forcing you to do this ? <p> His mother kissed him on the lips for good-bye , and he tasted her stale breath . " Your father will see God 's light in you , " she said . " He 'll come to his senses , and the woman too . " She looked out over the fields , and when she spoke again Stuart recognized her church voice , the one that made you listen whether you wanted to or not , the one that made you ache to speak in tongues and prophesy until you fell into a sleep that left you still and clean and filled with grace enough to last a lifetime .. He wondered for the first time if she 'd learned it from his father . " God never intends for any soul to be lost , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were born , even before your dad and I got together . I believe it was always in His plan for you to come and set things right . That poor little girl , named after some planet . " Then she shook her head and spoke in her normal voice again . " At least they did n't call her Pluto . or Uranus . " <p> In the distance , the front door of the house opened . A figure appeared , then another . one of the figures raised an arm , but both had long hair so Stuart could n't tell which was his father . Stuart 's mother did not wave back . Instead , she got into the car and started to pull away . Then she paused and inched back to where Stuart was still standing . " If it 's really awful , " she whispered , as if they were standing close enough to overhear , " just call me at Em 's and I 'll come get you right away . " <p> " I 'll be OK , " Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive , stepping over potholes shining with water . Thistles were blooming in the ditches , and small birds ducked between them , a scissoring of wings . He decided he would come right out and say , Do you still accept Jesus as your Savior ? No , he would just say hello . or maybe he would n't say anything , he 'd just wait for one of them to speak first . When he looked up again , the figures in the doorway had turned into a woman and a man , the woman standing off to the left and Stuart 's father , whom he recognized after all , just behind her . He had a sudden memory of sitting on his father 's lap , his back pressed into his father 's stomach . It was dusk , late summer , and his father had just finished cutting the grass . A wall of fireflies moved toward them until , up close , it broke apart , the pieces dancing around them . <p> " You remember me , then , " his father said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a moment , Stuart wondered if his father would kiss him , perhaps on the lips , and his stomach squirmed with the awfulness of it even after his father took his hand away . He knew he should say something , say-something . But he could not . <p> " And this is Miriam , " his father said , putting one arm around her broad shoulders . Looking into her face , Stuart imagined he could see the flat , midwestern landscape of her childhood laid out as plainly as the pictures in his geography book at school , the crisp cut squares of wheat and corn , the wide tornado sky in August , and the dulling snow in winter that pressed everything smooth beneath it . At first , he thought she had made up her eyes in what his mother called earth tones : dun , moss , slate . Then he realized that this was the color of her skin . Her eyelashes were distinct and dark , the thick legs of a spider creeping close . When she leaned to kiss him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The back of his throat was dry with the terrible obligation to be kind . <p> " There 's no reason we should all be friends right away , " his father said . The legs of Miriam 's jeans rubbed against each other as she turned and led them into the house . She had a slow , scuffling way of moving , as if there was nowhere in particular she needed to be . Stuart thought of the word slothful , which Pastor Hardy said meant lazy . In Bible study he had seen photographs of a sloth , a sad , blind animal , directionless , sinful . <p> The house was big and breezy inside , three times the size of Stuart 's own house , and cluttered with toys , coffee cups , newspapers , and magazines on astrology , child care , horses . A star chart hung high on the living-room wall , and crystals spun colored lights from the windows . Lining the low stone hearth in front of the fireplace was a military row of stuffed animals , and their black eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll get you something to drink , first , " his father was saying , and though Stuart was n't really thirsty , he was relieved to have a clear indication of what he was supposed to do next . The house had many oddly shaped rooms , and he peeked into each of them as he passed by , but did n't see the little girl , Mars . <p> " So how 's your mother ? " his father asked when he and Stuart were seated at the kitchen table . Stuart suddenly wished he had remembered to shake his father 's hand . He wanted his father to see how old he 'd grown , how manly . He wanted him to regret , deeply , everything he 'd missed . <p> " Fine . " <p> Miriam was fixing tall glasses of instant iced tea , stirring each one with her long middle finger . All her fingernails were bitten to the quick . She was plain , and her skin was bright with oil ; she looked nothing like Stuart 's mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added a spoonful of sugar to each from the sugar bowl in the center of the table . Then she added three more spoonfuls to her own . " I like mine sweet , " she said , and she looked squarely at Stuart for the first time , as if she expected him to contradict . <p> " Do you still go to church ? " he blurted to no one in particular , and then he felt his blush creep up his neck . <p> " Here we go , " Miriam said . " He 's going to be after us all week long . " But his father shook his head at her , his eyes pleading . <p> " Nancy told him to say that , " he said , and then to Stuart , " Your mother told you to say that , right ? " <p> " I guess , " he said . Too late , he thought of the right answer : God told me to say it . But the moment had passed , and his father was pushing his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got it over with , " he said . " You did what you were supposed to do , so there 's nothing to feel guilty about . I remember how all that was . " <p> Stuart did n't know what to say . <p> " Do you want to get to work on that fence ? " He carried his and Stuart 's half-filled glasses to the sink . " There 's nothing like hard work to get to know somebody better . " <p> " Stuart , " Miriam said , like she was tasting the word , and it needed something . " Is that a religious name ? " " It 's Nancy 's maiden name , " his father said . <p> " It sounds so formal , " Miriam said as if Stuart was n't even there , and she added another spoonful of sugar to her iced tea . " By the time you get back , Mars should be up from her nap . " <p> " Is Mars your maiden name ? " Stuart said . Miriam blinked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh that made Stuart understand he 'd done the right thing , though he did not understand why . <p> " Mars was named for her birth sign , and it suits her to a T , " she said . " You 'll see what I mean when you meet her . All she 's talked about for days is her new big brother . " <p> The black flies were covering Stuart 's neck and face and the backs of his hands by the time he and his father reached the edge of the pasture , following the wide trail of flattened grass that ended at a pile of rough posts . " I hauled these out yesterday , " his father said , " we might as well start here , " and he dropped the bundle of tools he had been carrying , balanced across his shoulder as easily as a child . There were a pickax , a spade , a thick metal crowbar , and something that looked to Stuart like two shovels fastened together . He picked it up , squeezing the handles so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a clamshell , " his father said . " It brings the dirt up out of the hole . " <p> Stuart stabbed the clamshell fiercely at the sod , and it bounced back up , nicking his shin . He could feel his face darken ; his eyes watered and stung . Far back in his mind , he could hear the tips of the grasses scratching at the knees of his jeans . <p> " There 's a trick to it , " his father said kindly , " like everything else in life , huh ? " and he scratched away a patch of the grassy carpet with the spade , then handed Stuart the pickax . " Let gravity guide the point down , " he said . " If you use too much muscle , you 'll wind up catching your foot . " <p> The pickax was evil-looking , a tool the devil might carry , and lifting it made Stuart feel like someone he did not know . But it was good to hear the point rip through the sod , puncturing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and he moved in to clear away the loosened dirt with his spade . " Give it another whack . " Stuart attacked the ground again , gradually growing comfortable with the weight of the ax , the way it felt in his hands . <p> They took turns , and Stuart glanced up now and then at the sloping hills around the field , charting the progress of the long shadows that slid toward him like reaching fingers . The hills were the beginnings of the Berkshires ; you could n't tell what was behind them . He tried to imagine how it would be to grow up in a place like ohio , so flat that your shadow bled away from you in perfect proportion and you saw what was coming towards you miles before it got there . In such a place , you would never be disillusioned or surprised . If there was a God , He would be visible . There 'd be nowhere for Him to hide . <p> He was breathing hard and so was his father . Each hole had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to work the clamshell , heavy with rocks and dirt . His hands were blistering . He could smell his father 's sweat and an oniony odor that he realized was his own , and when they took breaks they drank from the same bottle of water , not bothering to wipe off the mouth . Stuart began to tell his father about school and his mother and the people they knew from church . His father told him things about his own life with Miriam and Mars , and Stuart did not realize how much they had been talking until his voice grew hoarse and began to crack . Then he realized that this had nothing to do with what he was supposed to be talking about . He thought about his mother , who by now must be with Emily , and how the two of them would pray for him off and on all day . He thought about how , at night , his mother would kneel alone beside her bed to pray again . He was silent , embarrassed , until his father asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Stuart said , " did you ever think what you did was a sin ? " <p> His father mashed a black fly that had landed on his wrist . It left a dark smear on his pale skin . " For a long time , that 's all I could think of , " he said . " But now , I guess I do n't think about sin so much anymore . There are things people do , and things people do n't . People make choices . And some of those choices are hurtful . " <p> Stuart thought about this as his father fitted the first of the posts into one of the holes they had made , and a great feeling of relief washed over him . He thought about his own life , and decided he wanted to try making a choice of his own , without consulting God or his mother or anybody , just to see what would happen . It was then he decided he did n't want to be called Stuart anymore ; he wanted to be called Start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell his mother when he got home . After all it was the same word , except for the missing u . But he knew in his heart it was a very different name , and his mother would sense that immediately . It was a name that meant things like go and begin ; it would carry him places beyond Maine and even Massachusetts , perhaps even as far as the Midwest and its open skies and flat , straight roads where there was nothing to trip you up . <p> " I do n't want to get you in trouble with your mother , " his father said . " So why do n't you just tell her I regret my sins deeply . There , 1 just said that to you . You do n't even have to lie . " <p> Stuart nodded , and his father came over and put his arm around his shoulder . Stuart felt the strength drain out of his legs and ripple away into the ground , and he clung to his father tightly , tightly , and his father hugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he sensed that his father expected nothing from him beyond this particular moment . Think of God as your Heavenly Father , Pastor Hardy counseled , but with God there was always a trace of fear , like the faint tang of salt left on your skin after the beach , the possibility that something you had done or were about to do was wrong , and this would be the last straw , the thing that caused God to spew out your soul in disgust . Now , for the first time in Stuart 's life , not even in the smallest , meanest part of himself did he feel that he might be found wanting . <p> " In fall , when the leaves turn , you 'll come back and we can go horseback riding , " his father said , and he let go of Stuart a bit awkwardly . " There are trails on the state park land up the road . Maybe your mother would want to come too . " Stuart imagined what his mother would have to say about horses , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought they wanted to live close to the land like they were animals . It would not be a good idea . He decided not to say anything about changing his name just yet . <p> The shadows from the Berkshires had covered them completely by the time they started back toward the house . As they came up out of the pasture , Stuart saw that Mars was waiting for them . She was plump like Miriam , and she stood with her feet planted far apart , as if she were daring someone to try and push her off balance . " I know karate , " she announced to Stuart . " I can beat you up . " <p> " Oh , sweetheart , " his father said wearily . " Ca n't you say hello like a good girl ? " <p> " No ! " Mars shrieked . She grabbed Stuart by his blistered hands and dragged him into the house where she began introducing him to all her stuffed animals . Miriam came in and her eyes met Stuart 's , one adult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? <p> " It 's OK , " Stuart said , and he swung Mars up onto his shoulders as she pummeled his neck with karate chops , giggling , hollering , " You 're going to die ! " When Miriam called to Stuart 's father , " Hey , Greg , looks like Mars has finally met her match ! " Stuart felt a swift flush of pride . He gripped Mars 's bony knees tightly , awed and amazed that there was another person in the world who was made up of some of the same pieces that were contained in Stuart 's own body . It made him seem larger than he really was . It made him seem capable of more . <p> For supper that night , Miriam served tuna casserole , whole milk , creamed corn from a can . In the center of the table was a long loaf of white bread , and a tub of butter stood beside it . Nobody said grace . Stuart watched as Miriam began to eat that bread , slice after slice , how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its glistening surface before easing it into her mouth . He was hungry , not for the bread , but for the obvious pleasure it gave her . She sighed as she ate , long dreamy sighs that even Mars 's shrill chatter did n't seem to disturb . At the end of the meal she took another slice , shaped it into a ball , and dipped it into the sugar bowl , and he wanted to catch her hand , to pry open her fingers like petals and swallow the gray lump of dough himself . He had never been to ohio or anywhere else outside the Northeast , but he sensed that this would change . He would call himself Start and grow his hair even longer than his father 's . He would fill a backpack with food and walk west until the land became smooth as skin . The earth tones around him would not be something women painted on their bodies , but a part of the moving , breathing land , and they would ring out like a choir . one day he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice something on the horizon , a house , perhaps , or a flock of drowsy sheep . With that his eyes would be opened , but it would be different than the way Pastor Hardy said . It would be like the feeling he was having now , when you sense you 've crossed over to some distant place and stayed just a moment too long , so that returning is no longer a possibility . <p> <p> By A.
