<p> Now well into his fourth decade of critical acclaim and public recognition , the artist is as polite , remote and mysterious as ever <p> In February , the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis opened an immense exhibition of Jasper Johns prints with the standard museum celebratory weekend . For the occasion , his dealer , the legendary Leo Castelli , traveled there from New York in the company of a small group of friends , associates and favorite collectors , a kind of floating support group that appears to stand in for Johns ' family . Some of them were in Italy for the Venice Biennale in 1988 when Johns carried off the Grand Prize , the Golden Lion . Later that year , the Venice show came to Philadelphia , and more of them made that trip . This month , they will surely be found in Washington for the National Gallery of Art 's homage  --  a lavish offering of Jasper Johns drawings . <p> Events of this sort do not greatly vary . There is usually a dinner graced by local celebrities  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came to the Walker evening for the launch of " Jasper Johns : Printed Symbols . " There may be readings ; in Minneapolis , composer John Cage , an old friend , recited a long , loving tribute . And there is always the artist , courtly , reserved , somewhat remote , intensely concerned with how his work is shown . At a brief ceremony in the Walker auditorium , the director , Martin Friedman , announced that when he had finished speaking , he would introduce Johns from the audience . Friedman had been warned , and so were the guests : " He will stand and say nothing . " <p> On less-public occasions , Johns does , of course , speak , with impenetrable courtesy , without a trace of his South Carolina origins , in elegant , ironic , guarded language deftly veiled against untoward intrusion . After a close , harmonious working relationship that has endured for 33 years , Leo Castelli can still be heard referring to his gallery 's most important artist as " so mysterious . " And a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly as long says that at any fresh encounter he is still startled by how oblique Johns can be . " You ask Jasper what time it is and the kind of answer you get might be something like , I did n't know you were interested in time . ' " <p> The art offers no easier access . From those first deadpan images of the late 1950s  --  the flags and targets and assemblages of letters and numbers  --  to the later surreal and possibly more personal meditations on living and dying , the work has been difficult and demanding . To the attentive student , it has also been rewarding , a kind of decades-long conversation with a vividly intelligent , quietly desolate man obsessed with , among other things , visual perception , the ways we see and the ways we fail to see . As a scholar of his work , Roberta Bernstein , once wrote , " For Johns , the eye is an extension of the mind .... " In short , the mechanism for seeing is also " the central vehicle for thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that this privileged union of senses is unique to Johns . Still , few other artists are likely to have achieved his rarefied status . Rummaging through the literature of adulation , you will learn that Jasper Johns is " the closest thing American art has to a living national treasure " ; " the most important artist of the second half of the century " ; " le peintre americain le plus important depuis Pollock " ( " the most important American painter since Pollock " ) ; and " the deepest of living American artists . " <p> Just one of those accolades would surely qualify him for the National Gallery show , " The Drawings of Jasper Johns , " which is only the second exhibition conferred on a living artist in the museum 's 49-year history . ( With unnerving contrasting symmetry , the first , in 1987 , put its spaces at the service of Andrew Wyeth 's nearly photographic renderings of " Helga , " clothed and bare . ) The show opens May 20 , five days after Johns ' 60th birthday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Nan Rosenthal , the gallery 's curator of 20th-century art , and Ruth E. Fine , curator of modern prints and drawings . <p> From Washington , the drawings will move to the Kunstmuseum Basel , Switzerland , August 19-October 28 ; and then to the Hayward Gallery , London , November 29-February 3 , 1991 . ( The traveling schedule for the Walker Art Center prints exhibition , after it closes on May 13 , will be the Museum of Fine Arts , Houston , June 17-August 19 ; the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco , September 15-November 18 ; the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts , December 14-March 10 , 1991 ; the St. Louis Art Museum , April 6-May 27 ; the Center for the Fine Arts , Miami , June 22-August 18 ; and the Brooklyn Museum , September 14-November 10 . ) The work is full of visual puns <p> The Washington event is the first major offering of Jasper Johns drawings in 15 years , and to anyone who has never seen more than a few , the 117 pieces assembled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amazement . The average museum-goer is apt to think of drawing as a kind of diary , the artist 's gift of swift , intimate scrawls that usually precede paintings , a little window into his creative soul . As it happens , Johns ' working sketchbook is profoundly personal , closed to all but a few friends , and there is not much that is spontaneous or intimate about his public works on paper . Like the prints , they are usually made after he has put his ideas on canvas . And they repeat familiar painted images endlessly , always with some obvious or subtle variation , to some hidden or obvious purpose . The work is full of visual puns , according to Rosenthal , and to move from drawing to drawing , observing changes , is to see the artist at play , " deeply serious play . " In a sense , she writes in her catalog essay , these drawings are " art about art . " <p> They are frequently huge , always elaborately worked and often a surprise . One of Johns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to scale , of two Ballantine ale cans . He returned to the theme several times . Eighteen years after the original sculpture , he returned to it yet again , this time drawing on plastic in ink and luminous color . Suddenly , a pair of Jasper Johns ale cans glow like mysterious holy objects . <p> Few artists juggle such a range of materials . Pen , pencil , charcoal , crayon , chalk , pastel , watercolor and collaged scraps of newspaper may be put to the service of his drawings . Johns has left handprints on paper in emulation of a hatchmark pattern that dominated his work in the 1970s , and he has used the imprints of a packaged sweet , Morning Coffee Cookies , to embellish a piece . The results can be commanding and rich . <p> " Rich " inevitably has multiple connotations in the context of his work . If they know nothing else , even the most indifferent observers may know that not long ago , S. I. Newhouse jr. , chairman of Conde Nast Publications and a major collector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record at the time , for False Start , a vibrantly colored piece painted 29 years earlier . Johns was at his house on St. Martin when the auction took place , and Castelli called to give him the news . As he remembers it , the artist 's response was an uninflected " Oh . " The impact of record-setting prices <p> The works of Jasper Johns have been setting records almost from the start . Flattering though this may be , it is hard not to wonder whether it could also be burdensome . That kind of question causes Johns to retreat to the third person , as if he were discussing a distant cousin : " One can say , It has nothing to do with me , it only has to do with this object . . . ' " he comments . " But of course one is attached in some way to one 's work and feels it has some sort of meaning . An ambiguous situation is set up where the meaning given to the work by the society , if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of his friends will shoulder the discomfort . In an interview , a young dealer who has done some business for him professed indignation at all the talk of " money , money , money " and announced that if this disagreeable subject were to find its way into print , he would not allow his name to be used . Happily , the art market is not a shrine to consistency . Hardly a moment later , he reported the encouraging news that at least Johns prints are still modestly priced . A recent piece , Winter , part of a series entitled The Seasons , can be had for $15,000 to $18,000 , he said , and " most people can afford that . " <p> At auction , the bargain hunter can also find prints for less or for more , much more . Last fall 's Sotheby 's Contemporary Print sale saw a rare graphic series go for $275,000 ; the 65 lots by Johns sold that day brought their owners a total of $3,855,500 . <p> Leo Castelli , small , elegant , welcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States to pay young artists a monthly stipend  --  is less reticent about price . Shortly after the National Gallery opening , he plans a Johns show : some drawings and prints and perhaps nine new paintings . Three years ago , at the exhibition of The Seasons , the prices for the big paintings averaged $575,000 . At the next show , they were up to $850,000 . Castelli is not sure , but he supposes that this time large paintings may be priced as high as $1 million . <p> By opening day , every one will probably have been sold . There are perhaps a dozen serious collectors of Jasper Johns paintings in this country , and most of them regularly woo Castelli for the favor of an early viewing of new work . If they have what he calls " certain privileges , " it is because he can be sure that any painting they buy is destined for a wall at home . The value of a new Johns canvas can double or triple in no time at all , and Castelli is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store a work briefly and then make a quick , easy profit on resale . <p> The material rewards of this kind of success are , at the very least , comforting . In addition to the place on St. Martin , a Southerner 's refuge from winter cold , Johns has a modest country retreat upstate in Rockland County , New York , and a recently acquired townhouse in Manhattan  --  an unusual double-width structure built around a central courtyard , it was once the home of another kind of artist , the fabled stripper Gypsy Rose Lee . A move to New York and a new life <p> There one day he sits at his kitchen table cradling a cup of coffee and patiently answering questions , sometimes punctuating a cleverly uninformative comment with a large , engaging guffaw . The chaste , controlled decorative style of this room and others through which he leads a visitor gives new meaning to the concept of minimalism . Large empty spaces dominate , and nowhere is there a hint of clutter . Most artiste ' studios are surrounds of warm disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat . The place , of course , is a feast of fine art , other people 's as well as his own . ( The largest private collection of Jasper Johns works , according to Castelli , is in the hands of their maker . ) The sitting room holds , among other things , a John Chamberlain crushed metal scupture ; two small Kurt Schwitters collages ; several Andy Warhol Heinz boxes serving as end tables ; Man Ray 's witty Cadeau , the flatiron bristling with tacks . On the coffee table , a few art books are lined up with conspicuous precision . There is also a telephone console bearing four numbers . This is a busy place . <p> It is the kind of house dating from World War I in which you expect to see a fireplace in every room . Johns confides that he had most of them removed : they reminded him of his boyhood when firewood was the only source of heat , and lugging logs from the yard was a daily and deeply resented chore . The small detail is startling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyless odyssey of his childhood , years in which he seems to have been moved about like a misaddressed package . His parents parted soon after his birth in Georgia , and he was sent to live with grandparents in Allendale , South Carolina . " My family were very narrow in a sense , provincial , sort of country people . The men were all farmers and the women schoolteachers . " No one ever talked about family history and only lately , with hardly anyone alive to ask , has he begun to wonder about it . <p> Johns had finished the third grade when his grandfather died and he was shipped off to Columbia to his remarried mother and her new family . A year later , he departed for what would be six years with an aunt who taught school in a tiny lake town . Then , back again in the maternal household , he finished his final high school terms , a lanky , reserved , well-mannered boy who drew all the time and whose favorite color would forever be gray . <p> His speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawl go ? He 's not sure . Possibly , he speculates , he lost it playing around in college theater . His grandfather left land to be sold to pay for his education , and Johns spent a few semesters at the University of South Carolina before heading to New York to begin his life as an artist . <p> Time has eroded and grayed a cap of fine platinum hair ; the pleasures of the table  --  he is a talented cook  --  have fleshed out the frame . In the kitchen , he rises now and then to refill his cup , always asking with elaborate courtesy , " May I give you more coffee ? " On the wall behind him is a Johns hatchmark painting , this one set down in uncharacteristically pale , gentle tones . On top of a high wall cabinet is his small collection of George Ohr pots , the work of the turn-of-the-century craftsman known fondly as " the mad potter of Biloxi " ( Highlights continued , March 1990 ) . Brilliantly glazed , the pieces had been punched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' eye , and some of them have found their way into recent paintings . <p> Johns ' rate of painting is increasingly unhurried ; in all these years he has turned out little more than 300 canvases . If there is a reason for this leisurely pace , he appears indifferent to the notion of investigating it . He will paint for a while , then perhaps gaze at the canvas for a while or , if he is in St. Martin , go off to swim or garden for a while . Rarely will he abandon a piece . " I do n't like to do that . I just keep putting more stuff on top so I do n't feel I 'm abandoning it . " This statement is followed by one of his big laughs . No , he says more seriously , he would n't exactly consider it a defeat to give up a canvas . " I think I associate abandonment with a period in my life when I did n't finish what I set out to do . It holds a kind of fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally frugal in the print shop and , given the more modest hours involved , more prolific . There are about 330 prints , and a full set of them is now in possession of the Walker Art Center through several gifts . Some came from Ken Tyler , a master printer who worked with Johns years ago at Gemini G.E.L. , a printing company in Los Angeles ; the rest , 240 pieces owned by Johns , were bought for a relatively modest price with a private donation of what has been said to have been several million dollars . <p> Tyler has watched some major contemporary figures work at graphics , and he says , " I can tell you there are few artists who have the gifts and the talent and the willpower and the discipline to keep doing this . Jasper makes every nuance work for him and he makes every printing element work for him . " Johns is also  --  and one sometimes forgets how essential this is to the labor of art  --  willing to undertake the most tedious detail . At Gemini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an edition of 60 slices of white " bread , " which he then patiently spent several weeks hand-coloring , goodnaturedly enduring the printers ' jibes that the place might be renamed " The Jasper Johns Bakery . " <p> One of the striking aspects of Johns ' history is that he is largely , brilliantly , self-taught . He came North at 19 , briefly tried art school and then was drafted into the Army . Out of uniform and back in New York , he clerked in a bookshop and began to work at art . It could be said that his serious education was launched in 1954 when he met and began a crucial relationship with Robert Rauschenberg , a Texan , an avant-garde artist who had already been noticed , a generous spirit who shared ideas , friends and even work . For some years , the two men lived and painted in the same downtown loft building , and when money was needed , they collaborated , under the pseudonym of Matson Jones , on some memorable , meticulously realistic window displays for Tiffany 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his gallery venture , came to visit in 1957 ; it was the discovery that Johns lived downstairs that stirred his dealer fever . Not long before , Castelli had been transfixed by a Johns piece , Green Target , that hung in a Jewish Museum show . Johns got his first one-man show , before Rauschenberg , at Castelli 's gallery in January 1958 . People in the business of looking at art still recall that event the way one remembers momentous visual experiences : the first sight of Chartres cathedral , for example , looming on the flat horizon of the countryside . <p> In the decade of the reign of Abstract Expressionism , this unknown young man was painting recognizable objects and symbols as commonplace and thus usually as unnoticed as the linoleum on a farmhouse kitchen floor . What was exhilarating and unnerving were the sumptuous surfaces  --  Johns painted flags and numbers as if they were erotic objects . This artist had learned how to control a volcanic array of emotion by keeping the imagery at bay . <p> The show was a sensation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would soon become obvious , a bridge to the approaching Pop Art . All but two pieces were sold , and the buyers included the Museum of Modern Art , which carried away at least two paintings for its collection . Of course , not everyone loved the work . The flag paintings fretted a few literal-minded people who worried needlessly over whether they were intended as mockery . Some dissenters dismissed the work as neo-Dada , although , in truth , Johns had not yet discovered the work of either Duchamp or Man Ray . One scholar , momentarily depressed by these alien pictures , told himself he was witness to " the death of painting . " The eminent art historian Robert Rosenblum , then a graduate student who earned spare cash writing notices for an art periodical , was one of the few applauding reviewers . Even today , he remembers that first encounter : " I walked into the gallery and saw targets and flags , and my jaw dropped . I did n't know what it was . It would not compute . It had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the same time so unstraightforward . Everything about it was wrong ' and did n't fit any category , and you could n't get it out of your head . " Almost overnight , Johns had achieved economic security , fame and loyal collectors . In New York , art patrons not only collect art , they expect to collect the company of the artist . Johns is open to social friendships of this sort , but Castelli recalls that the late Robert Scull , a taxi fleet owner who orchestrated his own fame around a contemporary collection , became so demanding and so fixed on the artist that Johns icily retreated . According to Castelli , the skull in the lower right corner of a 1963-64 work , Arrive/Depart , represents the painter 's sardonic dismissal of the taximan . <p> On the other hand , his loyalty can be munificent . Once , at dinner , the late Victor Ganz , a collector with an impeccable eye , mentioned to Johns that a ceiling leak in his office had ruined two prints . The colors had run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he was leaving he said , " Let me have a look at those prints ; I 'll take them home . " A few weeks later , Sally Ganz remembers , a messenger arrived to return the pieces . The Ganzes discovered that they now owned two damaged Johns prints disguised as watercolors . When Johns called up a few mornings later , he was surprised to get Victor Ganz on the phone . " How is it you 're still home this morning ? " he asked . " I stayed home to pour water on all my Johns prints , " Ganz replied amiably . A question of autobiography <p> One of the hallmarks of a master is that he never stops exploring . There are 35 years ' worth of paintings , drawings and prints of flags , dozens of them , each wrought to some different visual purpose . Every ten years or so , there is definable alteration in style . In the late ' 60s and on into the ' 70s Johns was drawn to strongly abstract imagery ; paintings appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and adopted because , as he liked to say , they had been taken . " They are not mine . " <p> In the past decade came another major change : paintings with recognizable imagery that seemed to be a sort of reportage about the artist , his literary interests , his possessions and his obsessions . Among other things , he was entranced by imagery that represented two things at once , an old design that could be a duck or a bunny , a face that carried the profiles of a young beauty and a crone . <p> The four big pieces of The Seasons not only abound with personal references to his life and work , but each is dominated by the figure of the artist , actually taken from an outline of his body as it appeared in shadow in the sun . Of course , the fact that Johns is represented by a shadow , and a transparent shadow at that , should occasion some wonder about how much revelation the pictures offer . <p> Still , the critical community triumphantly reported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had caught Johns with his guard down . Now , in his kitchen , a question on this subject produces a long silence while he searches for useful phrases to express denial . Finally he says , " Well , they 're not narrative , so they 're not autobiographical in that sense . Some of the images in the paintings are taken from things that are Johns ' , but I do n't see how that 's more autobiographical than those taken from other places . " <p> A little later , he stands in the middle of his light-flooded workroom gazing on a recent painting set out by his studio assistant . On a peach-toned background , facial fragments are scattered about  --  parts of eyes , a female mouth , the outline of nostrils . The picture also has a framed portrait of a small red-sailed boat . The printing on the top spells out " Montez " and another line in barely discernible letters says " Singing . " The piece carries the first name of his grandmother , who , he explains , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sails in the Sunset . " <p> It seems pointless to inquire about the uses of autobiography here . Besides , in this setting , it is hard to choose between admiring the painting or its maker . As he gazes silently on his work , Johns resembles nothing so much as one of those trompe l'oeil elements he dotes on . The expression on his face is at once coolly remote and warmly involved , skeptical and pleased , secret and open  --  altogether a living model of a Jasper Johns work of art . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : In a portrait made of Johns at age 58 , Hans Namuth captured the artist 's uncompromising character . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Also based on an earlier painting , Harlem Light is an intricate drawing of graphite wash and other media . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Watercolor , pastel and graphite Flag on Orange Field , 1957 , is from series of iconic paintings begun in 1954 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The stone-wall pattern refers to an actual wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Johns began to use hatchmarks in 1972 .
