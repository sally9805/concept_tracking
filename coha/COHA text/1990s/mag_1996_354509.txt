WHEN HE REPORTED TO THE scorer 's table at the Great Western Forum , the game clock was stopped with 9:39 remaining in the first quarter . Yet it was after his entrance , and after the clock began ticking away , that time stood still . Earvin Johnson may have been 4 1/2 years older and 30 lbs . heavier than when he last played in the N.B.A. , but the Magic we saw last Tuesday looked an awful lot like the Magic we remembered as he passed and deked and shot and led the Los Angeles Lakers to a 128-118 victory over the visiting Golden State Warriors . " It was great , " the 36-year-old Johnson said after the game . " It was so much fun . Man ! " <P> Man , indeed . In 27 minutes , the Lakers ' old point guard and new power forward scored 19 points , assisted on 10 other baskets and pulled down eight rebounds . As impressive as those numbers were , it was the transcendent smile he flashed throughout the game that made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there , or for the 3 million households that watched the game on TV , but also for the 19 million people around the world who are trying to cope with the fact that they , like Magic , are HIV-positive . Says Sean Strub , the founder and publisher of Poz , a bimonthly magazine with a readership of 315,000 : " This is going to tell tens of thousands of people with AIDS and HIV that they do n't have to give up . They do n't have to believe the death hype . They can go on with their lives . " <P> Johnson 's debut performance set the stage for a tantalizing matchup Friday night between the Lakers and Michael Jordan 's Chicago Bulls . Alas , Los Angeles found out the hard way why the Bulls are off to the best start in N.B.A. history ( 41-3 ) . Chicago won by a score of 99-84 , disappointing such celebrities as Jack Nicholson , Denzel Washington and John Cusack . Magic was n't nearly as dazzling as he had been against the Warriors , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and he showed he was n't afraid to tangle with the likes of Dennis Rodman , Chicago 's rebounding master . <P> If there was a bittersweet feeling to Johnson 's return last week , it came from the realization that his exile from the game had been largely unnecessary . When Magic announced to the world on Nov. 7 , 1991 , that he had contracted the AIDS virus , it seemed to many that he was pronouncing his own death sentence . Michael Cooper , a teammate at the time , left the press conference crying . Johnson had to quit basketball then , supposedly for the sake of his own health and definitely for the peace of mind of his peers . He made cameo appearances , first at the 1992 N.B.A. All-Star Game and then as a member of the USA 's Dream Team in the Barcelona Olympics , but when he tried to make a comeback in the fall of ' 92 , the fears of some outspoken N.B.A. players forced him to call it off .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
