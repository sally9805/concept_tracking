It is my birthday , my twentieth birthday , and I 'm in the bar of one of the Art Deco hotels on the beach when I meet her . They are always using this hotel on Miami Vice , although they are careful to take tight shots of the pink front and not show the bums and junkies down the street , not until later in the episode , so it seems like they are miles away , in another Miami . <p> The bar is beautiful  --  exquisite , that 's the word that comes to me  --  black and white and chrome . I feel odd here , like I 'm watching myself on TV . I am with a guy , Roberto , who I met at Florida State before my student loan money ran out . After I left FSU , I went back to working as a bellboy at the same hotel , the Royale Palms , where my mom and I used to live , where I worked in high school , a big fifties not thirties kind of place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice . Roberto went on with prelaw , while I got moved up from bellboy to parking attendant . That 's how I ran into him again . I parked his BMW and I asked him about Maddy , who used to be my girlfriend before she decided to be Roberto 's . He said she was fine , just fine , which is good because while I 'm not mad at Roberto , I worry about Maddy . When he heard it was my birthday , he insisted , really insisted , we go out for a drink . So that 's how I happen to be in this bar , which is very expensive , because Roberto brought me . <p> Roberto is Cuban , which I 'm not , although everyone always says I look it . When I want to , I claim to be Brazilian , because my father is or was . I never met him , but we share the same name , Paulo , Paulo Silvas . Roberto is not only Cuban , he 's Batista 's grandson or great-nephew or something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday . As soon as we sit down , some general disguised as a lawyer comes up and begins to talk the old politics . Even in a place like this , full of Yankee tourists , Roberto ca n't get away from Little Havana . When the white hair starts talking , Roberto shrugs , pats my shoulder . He buys a drink for me and I go sit at the bar , which is made of glass bricks and underlit so that all the people sitting at it look ghastly or exciting , depending on your mood . <p> She sits next to me . In the mirror , she looks thin , rich , a woman with dark hair and eyes as brown as mine , although hers are raccooned with mascara . She is wearing a black dress so simple it has to be expensive and silver earrings like needles . Pretty good , but pretty old , in her forties somewhere . Almost as old as my mother . <p> She looks me over in the mirror , too , steadily , as if the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the silk shirts Kirov , the old Jew who owns Royale Palms , gave me . He lives in one of the oceanside suites , and when you do something for him  --  nothing illegal , just something nice like bringing him breakfast and a bottle of vitamin C when you know he 's been drinking too long to remember about eating  --  he goes to his closet and gives you one of his shirts . He has them in all sizes , because his weight is always yo-yoing up and down , and they are really beautiful shirts , handmade . <p> On top of Kirov 's shirt , I am wearing a Giorgio Armani jacket that Freddie , the bell captain , took out of the room of some Colombian who got shot in Hialeah . I felt bad about the jacket for a while . In Brazil there are probably all kinds of taboos against wearing the clothes of the dead . <p> The woman sitting next to me leans close to say something  --  they have the music up loud to make this sort of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are playing " Brazil , " which has been pretty popular since the movie . Where the songs are passionate . And the smile has flash in it . She keeps her eyes on the mirror , but I feel her breath warm on my ear . She says , " I want you to treat me like a war <p> At first I do n't understand . Then I realize she has pronounced the w in whore . She has an odd accent , not Cuban , not any kind of Spanish . I look at her in the mirror again , and she looks back at me , perfectly expressionless . " I do n't have any money , " I say . She smiles for the first time , showing teeth . <p> " I said like , yes ? " She touches a fingernail to the collar of my jacket . " Not am Her nails are painted dark red but are different lengths , like maybe she bites them . " You do n't have to pay . " <p> " Well , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pay . " I do n't know why I say this . It 's a lie , and as soon as the words leave my mouth , I feel my heart jump . It just seems like the right sort of thing to say in this bar . The woman takes her eyes off the mirror and puts them on my flesh for the first time . She shakes her head no . <p> " But I do need a driver , " she says . " You can drive ? " Now the only place people have chauffeurs , I mean not just rented limos , is on Dynasty , so I decide she may be one of those people who are unable to keep life and TV on different sides of their brains . But it is my birthday , and I have tomorrow off . <p> " Sure , " I say , " who ca n't ? " even though I only learned to drive this year , practicing on cars the guests leave in my care at the hotel . When Kirov offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him I did n't know how to drive , but he just shrugged and said , " This is America . Learn Which I did , more or less . <p> " My car is outside , " the woman says and stands to leave . I nod and stand , too , and when I do , I notice we are the same height , five nine or so . A height which feels tall on Miami Beach , where the parking meters are taller than a lot of the old people . I go over to the table where Roberto is sitting and explain I have to leave . The white-haired man frowns . <p> " Go ahead Roberto says , very smooth , " take your aunt home . You would n't want her to get into trouble I feel the woman watching from the door . <p> When I join her , she takes my arm and we go out into the pink lobby . She is shaking her head . " Whore , no , " she says . " You are a "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a pusher , yes ? " Her accent is suddenly thick , breathless . She glances back at Roberto and the old lawyer , imagining God knows what but certainly not the usual bitter denunciation of Kennedy 's treachery at the Bay of Pigs . " Yes ? " she says again , her head bobbing . <p> I think about telling the woman the truth , that I am not a whore or a player , but a college dropout , a parking attendant at a turquoise-colored , not-so-good hotel . But she puts her hand on my lapel and says , " You can call me Claudia . What shall I call you ? " <p> " Paulo , " I say , telling the truth , which she does n't recognize . <p> " Paulo , " Claudia says , and again , " Paulo , " as if tasting it . I frown . " Do n't worry . It will do . So , " she says , " you are not American ? " <p> I give up . " Brazil , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I was born in Hungary , " she says . " Buda . " <p> " Budapest ? " She shakes her head . " Buda , " she says . " The other side of the river , that is Pest . " <p> " Like Miami and Miami Beach , " I say , but she does n't know about that . <p> We step out of the hotel , and the hot August night air hits us . Claudia puts her hand around mine , and I notice that both our palms are sweating . We go for the car , which turns out to be a black BMW with Palm Beach County plates . BMWs are ugly cars , really , very boxy-looking , for all their expense . Their owners are crazy about them , though . I backed one into a concrete piling in the parking garage , and the owner was really pissed . Luckily , the hotel garage has a big sign that says it does n't take responsibility . Claudia gives me her keys , and I open the passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the car , Claudia gets some coke out of the glove compartment  --  not a very safe place to keep it , any parking attendant could tell you  --  and hands it to me . In high school when I thought I 'd be a lawyer someday , have to pass the bar and all , I practiced a lot of self-restraint . I was known for it , really . But since I went to FSU and came back the same year , it 's been hard to see the point . Still , since I 'm known for saying no , hardly anyone offers , and I am nervous as Claudia hands me a rolled bill , watches me set up , afraid of not getting it right . Then I do a line , get that chlorine feeling , like pool water up my nose . Immediately I feel a lot better , more cheerful . I do another . I can definitely see the appeal . I offer Claudia the last one , but she shakes her head , so I do that one , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I ask . Since Claudia did n't touch the coke , I am guessing she usually does not do this sort of thing , either . Maybe she thinks she is being the perfect hostess . <p> " I want you to drive , " Claudia says . She unrolls the bill , holds it out , and I see it 's a hundred , the kind of tip no one at the Royale Palms ever gives . I should be having doubts , I know , but by now <p> am feeling so cheerful I ca n't imagine what they could be . I take the money . I 'll drive her around , catch a bus home . <p> " Yes , ma'am , " I say . If nothing else , working at a hotel teaches you to be polite . " Where ? " <p> She shrugs . " All night . " <p> I think about it a minute . Since we are on the beach , everything farther east is water . West of Miami is the Everglades , and south is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba likely this century . So I head north , following the route the Greyhound bus took to get me to FSU . Claudia turns the AC on high and puts a tape in the Blaupunkt , something African with a lot of drums . She turns it up until I can feel it like a fist in my chest . " To keep you awake , yes ? " she says . <p> Claudia curls up on the seat , her head against the armrest , her stocking feet in my lap . For a while she moves her feet back and forth against the erection I ca n't help getting , but then she falls asleep . The headlights catch a turnoff , a green road sign , Lantana  --  38 miles , the road I would take in the somewhat unlikely event that this were a trip to visit my mother . As soon as I pass it , I know I have driven farther than I ever have before . I think of my mother in her trailer surrounded by Spanish bayonets . Until my sixteenth birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my mother , one to Kirov for the suite . Even after the checks stopped coming , my mother waited three months , just in case , before she announced over breakfast that she was going to take <p> job assembling B-1 bomber sights in Lantana . An old friend from high school had put her name in for it . " And me ? " I asked . " Kirov will give you a job , " she said . " After all these years , he owes us that . " <p> I pop out the tape and put on the radio . The Blaupunkt has shortwave . I turn off the AC , roll down the window a crack , and listen to Radio Havana . It 's what drives the Cubans so crazy , makes them all stay in Miami . Humidity just like home and Havana close enough to hear , never touch . When Radio Havana fades out , I twist the dial around and hear all kinds of things , Chinese , Russian , maybe German . I try finding Radio Brazil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure I would recognize Portuguese if I heard it . <p> After midnight , when it is no longer my birthday , I start noticing these odd signs on the side of the road , wooden letters mounted on cypress branches that say things like The Worlds Oldest Tourist Trap and Lady , If He Wo n't Stop , Hit Him ! Ten minutes later , I spot a low concrete building off to the left , catch a larger sign : Cypress Knee Museum . I wonder who stops at such places . Is this what people with cars do , people on vacation , people , say , on their way to the Royale Palms ? Then the signs disappear from my side of the road , but a few minutes later I see one lit up by the headlights of a southbound car . From behind , the letters on the dead branch look like hieroglyphics : ! miH tiH , potS t'noW eH fI . <p> By dawn , we are outside Orlando . Claudia sits up . She gazes out the window , yawning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . I pull into a rest stop and get out , stretch . Claudia hands me a bottle with some foreign  --  French ?  --  writing on it . " Vitamins , " she says . The pills inside are blue and look too tiny to be seriously harmful . I take one . Claudia takes three . I ask to borrow some change for the phone , and she says to get some out of her purse which is on the back seat . Inside , there is a regular rat 's nest of bills . I find a whole roll of quarters , hold it up to show her what I 'm taking . She shakes her head like she 's disappointed . " Take more , " she says . " Buy some ... " She pauses so I know what 's coming  --  American slang . " Some snow "  --  she doses her eyes  --  " or is it blow . " I take a couple of fifties . <p> Claudia goes off in search of tourist information . I call the Royale Palms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , picking up the phone on the first ring even though it is six in the morning . Like me , he has been up all night . I tell him I may not be in tomorrow , that my grandmother is sick . He laughs at this . When Dagoberto , the night desk clerk , wants time off , he always calls in and says his grandmother died . But I say sick and not dead because I may , after all , have a living grandmother in Brazil , <p> superstitious sort of country , and I would n't want to wish anything too bad on her . " Okay : ' Freddie says , still laughing . " I 'll cover for you August is the off-season , and he can afford to be easy . I tell him that if he needs my bed  --  I am living in one of the spare rooms  --  to lock my stuff in the linen closet . <p> " Thanks , " I say . <p> " De nada . " Freddie says . " Enjoy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk is recommending some fancy mall to Claudia , a place where she says there is serious shopping . The girl and Claudia share a moment of bonding . " Rive Gauche ? " Claudia asks . <p> " No shit , " says the girl . <p> So we go shopping . There is a store full of Giorgio Armani . I feel the French amphetamine take hold and maybe Claudia does , too . She trails her hand down a rack of suits . " For you , yes ? " she says in loud voice . After that , the saleswoman , a short Italian woman dressed in shades of gray , sticks to Claudia like mildew on a shower curtain . Together , they pull things from the racks , from the stockroom , even off the male mannequin in the window who has only half a head and that as empty as a bowl . Claudia makes me try on everything , model it for her . The saleswoman hands the clothes over the dressing-room door , then stands behind Claudia and watches me , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very low , their accents melting into a general foreignness . Claudia makes no attempt to say that I am her son or anything , and I think the saleswoman is very excited by the idea that I may be Claudia 's lover . She is older than Claudia , fifty or so , but I can see she is thinking Why not ! Thinking maybe she 'll find herself a pretty boy , someone who wants one of her suits and can no way afford one . <p> I turn my back on Claudia and look in the mirror . Each time I see myself , in black silk , in white linen , I keep having the same pair of thoughts . I think , This guy looks great and Who is he ? But each time the thoughts surprise me , like I am very stoned or dreaming . Claudia picks out a white linen suit , a pair of black jeans , two shirts , underwear , socks , a pair of shoes , and a suitcase to put it all in . More clothes than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe , in my whole life . At least I 'm getting a wardrobe out of this-the word trousseau pops into my mind . I decide to wear the white Armani suit over a yellow eighty-dollar T-shirt out of the store . I wonder what Maddy would think if she saw me . <p> " Come , " Claudia says and pulls me down the mall and into a jewelry store . She points to a display of ear studs . " For you , yes ? " <p> " For me , no , " I say . Most of the guys who work at the Palms have gone through this . I mean , the whole question of which ear to get pierced . Does right mean you 're gay and left straight , or will you move to Australia , find out that there you 've got it backwards and get butt-fucked ? A salesgirl appears . She grins at me . <p> " We can do the piercing here : ' she says and shows Claudia what looks like one of those things that punches holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves toward me . I back up until I hit the glass counter . She moves in very close , rakes her fingers through my hair , pulling it back from my forehead . It is the first time she has really touched me , and I would jump if I were n't squeezed against the counter . Out of the corner of my eye , I see the girl behind the counter blush , look away . <p> " Paulo , Paulo , " Claudia whispers . She pinches my right earlobe between her fingertips . " A diamond ? " Her eyes glitter as she says this . <p> " Okay , " I say . " If it 's a diamond . " <p> Before I can move , the salesgirl lifts her punch to my right earlobe , and I dose my eyes . I hear her breathing in my ear , and I think she is going to say something to relax me , like This hurts me more than it does you , but she does n't . She just staples my ear . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that this is something more permanent than a change of clothes . I take a deep breath , then with a click it is over . I imagine that Claudia is watching , but when I open my eyes , she is inspecting her fingernails as if she is afraid she has broken one off in my hair . She pays cash for the hole and the diamond stud , and at the last minute she buys me a red Swatch watch , which is much too young for me . As we are leaving , the salesgirl says , " Remember to bathe that ear with alcohol . When it comes to your health "  --  she glances sideways at Claudia  --  " you ca n't be too careful . " <p> My ear throbs . As soon as we are out of there , Claudia puts her hand on the back of my neck . " Your head hurts , yes ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Poor Paulo , " Claudia says , rubbing my neck . She sends me to the men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think she is crazy . This is Orlando . Home of Disney World , of M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E . But there is a tall black guy in a mall maintenance jumpsuit cleaning the urinal , and as soon as he sees me , he 's selling . I give the guy what he asks for , not quibbling about the price , which even <p> know is tourist-high . " Have a good one , " he says , stuffing the bills down the front of his coveralls . <p> Out in the parking lot , the car is like an oven , but Claudia gets in , anyway , kicks off her shoes , twists her feet up under her on the seat . " America , " she says . I touch the hot steering wheel of the BMW , tap one of my new Italian shoes on the gas pedal . <p> " America ? " I say , kidding . " Where ? " <p> " You do n't know , Paulo ? " she says , serious . " Then we must find out She waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot . " Is this America ? " <p> " Malls are very American , " I say , thinking maybe she is angling to take back my clothes . <p> " Malls , yes ? " And what else ? " I rack my brain but ca n't think of anything . <p> She reaches under the seat and pulls out about fifty tourist brochures she must have gotten at the rest stop . She shows me one with a parrot peddling a bird-size unicycle on the cover . " America ? " she says for the third time in less than a minute . <p> " Looks like it , " I say , thinking maybe I should have woken her up for the Cypress Knee Museum . <p> " Paulo . " Claudia touches a finger to my pocket , to the cocaine . The car is so hot now I can smell myself , like I 'm in a sauna where what they throw on the rocks is sweat . I crouch down behind the wheel and do the coke while she reads names to me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as I finish , she pokes me hard , lays two pamphlets open on my lap . " We go to this one She points to Weeki Wachee , Spring of the Living Mermaids , which a map on the back shows as somewhere near Tampa . " And this one She points to a picture of a ceiling hung with department-store mannequins to which someone has carefully added angelic wings and large erect nipples . This is at House on the Rock , which is somewhere in Wisconsin . <p> " Why ? " I say . <p> " Why not ? " Claudia asks , and whether it is because of the coke or because I have slept so little , I can not think of an answer . Instead I ask , " How far is it ? " <p> " To Weeki Wachee ? " <p> " To Wisconsin . ' <p> She goes back under the seat and comes up with a road atlas . She checks the chart in the back . " Twenty-four hours driving She pauses , reaching for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . <p> " Max , yes ? " <p> " Max , yes , " I echo . I imagine this going on and on , leaving us frozen in the doorway like those cartoon chipmunks  --  Are you . No , after you-so I stop . I take the atlas from her , turn to the map of the whole United States . My heart is pounding so hard from the coke that the blue lines that are the interstates jump like veins . I know I should get on a bus and go back to Miami , but the longer I think about it , the less I can see myself back at the Royale Palms , breathing carbon monoxide for two-dollar tips . Not yet . <p> think : I am twenty years old and have never been out of Florida . <p> I rub my hands over my face . Twenty-four hours . One day . I start the car . " Okay , " I say , " first stop , Weeki Wachee , " and as I pull out of the parking lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it feels to be driving a BMW , like it is something I 've missed for a long time without even knowing it . <p> By five , my usual dinner-break time , we are sitting side by side in a mildewy auditorium while on the other side of a plate-glass window girls wearing fishtails drink RC Colas underwater . The mermaids take occasional breaths from air hoses that bubble away like aquarium filters , and the water is so cold , their lips look blue in spite of their waterproof lipstick . The theme of the show is Carnival in Rio , and Claudia squeezes my hand as if she is afraid the sound of the samba is going to make me cry . At the end of the show , the mermaids wave a fond farewell , flippers flapping , as the PA system blares " We 've Got the Whole World by the Tail . " I lift Claudia 's hand from mine and wave back . <p> Claudia pays to have a Polaroid taken of me with one of the mermaids , a blond , freckled girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a stool in the lobby for this purpose . Cindy smells so much like strawberry shampoo that my mouth waters . I am tempted to ask her if she goes to FSU , see if she knows Maddy . But I am aware of Claudia watching me . She holds out the Polaroid for me to see , and an old man with a camcorder takes my place beside Cindy . I watch as two white blobs darken into smiling faces , and when I see mine , I am glad that I did n't say anything to Cindy . She looks wholesome in her green tail and modest bathing-suit top , while the circles under my eyes are so deep and dark they look like anuses . My earring . gleams . Claudia takes my hair in both of her hands , pulls it back . " You should show off your cheekbones , " she says . She borrows a rubber band from the girl at the ticket counter , fastens my hair in the shortest of ponytails . " Yes ? " Claudia asks the girl at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl says , smiling at me . " Really . " <p> A couple of hours later we pass the Welcome to Georgia sign , but even though I am watching carefully , the only change I see is the color of the pavement . By ten we are in Macon . Claudia insists we stop at a drive-in , where , perhaps because it is so American , she actually eats a barbecue sandwich , the first non-pharmaceutical thing I have seen her put in her mouth . I am careful not to get any of the sticky red sauce on my Armani suit . After we eat , I go to the men 's room to wash my hands . A guy , skinny and white this time , is upset because I do n't want crack . He offers to trade me some for my watch . This is all beginning to strike me as funny , but when I laugh he gets nervous . So I buy some coke , do it in one of the stalls . <p> When I come out of the rest room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , " she says , without looking up . <p> " Max , " I manage to say . It is twenty-four hours since we left Miami , and I have n't slept in maybe thirty-six . Out in the parking lot , Claudia takes a close look at me and offers to drive , but the coke has kicked in and I feel fine , ready to drive straight into the night , which we do , stopping only for gas near Nashville . I tell Claudia when we cross the border into Kentucky , but she does n't seem interested . Her eyes are closed , and her lips are set in a line , a little gray . " Why do n't you lie down ? " I say finally , and she does , this time with her head in my lap . This gives me an erection so hard it hurts , but she goes right to sleep . <p> I stay on I-65 , and I do n't stop , not even to piss , because although my bladder is full , Claudia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is something about the way my hands have locked onto the steering wheel , the fact that I can not feel my toes or fingertips , that tells me to make time while I can before I come down , that the crash waiting for me will be worse than bad , unimaginable . <p> Claudia sleeps and sleeps . I make it to Indianapolis sometime after dawn , follow the interstate downtown . Downtown Indianapolis is dismal , hot , rain coming down , passing steam going up . The buildings look rusty , vacant . We pass a convention center , windows dark , marquee empty , and I pull into the curved drive of the hotel attached to it . " I 'm stopping , " I announce to Claudia , but then I ca n't seem to get my foot off the gas and onto the brake in time . I end up back on the street , have to circle the block and try again . When I turn off the car , I just sit there , afraid I wo n't be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Claudia sits up , yawns so wide , her jaws crack . I tell her we are in Indiana , and she gives me this surprised look , as if maybe this whole trip is a joke one of us has taken too far . Then she shrugs , puts on lipstick . She leans across the seat and kisses me , slips her tongue between my lips . Surprised , I kiss back , and then I realize there is something bitter and hard in my mouth  --  one of her pills . I swallow , feel it burn all the way down . Claudia laughs . <p> A bellboy knocks on the window . " Sir ? " he says , although not with any conviction . I give him the keys , watch as he gets the luggage out of the trunk , opens Claudia 's door . He is blond , has no chin . Inside , Claudia registers for two rooms , like I am just her driver , just someone along for the ride . I do n't know what to think , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her like a war ? Claudia yawns , stands closer to the bellboy than to me . So I let the bellboy carry the suitcases upstairs . Claudia slips him a twenty , but the bellboy shoots me a look behind her back . I think I know what is coming . He waits until he has opened her door and she has gone in , then he covers his mouth with his hand , whispers , " Want to buy some pot ? It 's good shit , man " I almost laugh , start to say no , but then I stop . My hands are shaking , and I can feel Claudia 's little blue pill . I need help coming down . <p> " Sure , " I say . " Take my watch for it ? " He throws in some papers . But after I 've got it , I ca n't imagine smoking it . I lie down on my bed and wait for time to pass . I hear the TV come on in Claudia 's room , the bathroom fan . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around I was two , and sometimes I think I can almost remember that . I have this memory of something white , like a terry-cloth bathrobe , moving back and forth in front of the bars of my crib , sort of like the way they used to show Jesus in the old movies , all hem and no face . <p> After a while , it stops raining on Indianapolis . The sun comes out . I can see that much from where I 'm lying on the bed . I think about getting up , but somehow I do n't . Then it is dark , and I 'm confused because I do n't think I 've been asleep . I call down to the desk and ask what time it is . " Eight-thirty , " the girl says . " Probably you thought it was nine-thirty . Lots of people make that mistake because Indiana does n't go on Daylight Savings . So in the summer , it 's like we 're on Central Time , and in the winter , like we 're on Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Eight-thirty p.m. ? " I ask , and there 's a pause at the end of the line as she realizes just how confused I am . <p> " Yes , " she says . I give up trying to sound normal . <p> " And it 's what day of the week ? " <p> " Friday . " <p> " Thanks , " I say . " You 've been a big help . Really . " <p> I get up , and after I wash my face I knock on Claudia 's door . <p> " Claudia ? " <p> " It 's open , Paulo , " she says . " I would n't lock you out . " She is lying on the bed with her shoes off , drinking a Diet Coke and watching TV . I show her the pot . She looks in her purse . She pulls out a fistful of bills , the Polaroid of me at Weeki Wachee . " Maybe a lighter , yes ? " she says and keeps digging . " Here "  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun  --  " hold this It 's a small automatic . I know that much , even though this is the first gun I 've touched in my life . I 'm surprised how heavy it is , as if Claudia has handed me a Bic Flic that weighs as much as a pipe wrench . I check to see that the safety is on . It 's amazing what I 've learned from watching TV all these years . I sight down the barrel at a lighted office I can see through the window . If I fired , would I hit someone ? I look up to see Claudia smiling at me , a silver lighter open , flaming , in her hand . I can tell she is thinking how good I look with her gun , how experienced . " A nice toy for your line of work , yes ? " she says , her excitement as strong as her accent . I remember who she thinks I am . " Was expensive . " <p> I give her back the gun , sorry I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pick through the pot , roll a couple of lumpy joints , light one . We smoke half the dope , taking increasingly lopsided turns , two hits for me to her one . Then Claudia is standing by the door , her purse in her hand . " Come : ' she says . " I 'm ravenous , yes ? " We find an all-night Zippy Mart , but before we go in , I make Claudia leave her gun in the glove compartment . Claudia wanders dazed down the aisle as if she has forgotten what is edible and what is not . I find this rack of health food munchies and in a fit of homesickness pick out a dozen little bags of dried papaya . We are obviously high , but the checker , a women who must weigh three hundred pounds , barely glances at us , and we make it back to the hotel , Claudia 's room , undetected . I rip open the bags , dump them out on the bed . But it is Claudia who hunts down and eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little fuzzy from the bedspread , slapping my hand when I go for one . <p> We smoke the rest of the dope . While Claudia fills her lungs , <p> flip through the stations on the TV . We seem to be staying in the only major hotel in a major city that does n't have cable . Indianapolis , my kinda town . I stumble across the opening credits of Miami Vice . Just seeing the blue shallows of Biscayne Bay makes me homesick . I groan . On TV , Miami looks better than real . Claudia pulls me back to the bed , puts the joint to my lips . " Shhh , " she says , " shhh , " kissing my shoulder , my neck . I think we are going to do something more , but the bright colors of Miami pull us into the TV , and we watch hardly blinking as the boat Sonny is on undercover blows up . " Oooh , " Claudia says as the black smoke and orange flames roll over the calm aqua water . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten he 's a cop . Everyone tells him he 's a dealer , so he goes out to do a deal and ends up shooting a guy who is out to rip him off . He shoots him in the back , then once he has fallen , again in the head . Just like that , like pointing a finger . Claudia lets the joint go out . I relight it , burn my hand . <p> The show seems different stoned . The fast cutting , the coked out pacing , is slowed way down so the whole thing just flows , as if when the boat blew up , Sonny went to the bottom of the bay and discovered some other liquid Miami . Sonny makes love to a woman , shoots a man at close range in a car . He 's ordered to shoot Tubbs , his black partner , the only person  --  it seems obvious to me in that moment  --  that Sonny really loves . And he does shoot him , walks right by him without recognizing him and fires off two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luckily Tubbs is wearing a bullet-proof-vest and so is not dead . <p> Sonny sleeps with someone else , shoots someone else  --  another cop  --  but it seems to me that he is getting tired , as if this being someone else is losing its thrill . I want to tell him , Hey , compadre , I know how you feel . But suddenly the show is over  --  To be continued . <p> Claudia unzips my fly . On the TV , a woman is dressing exotic birds in costumes fastened in the back by tiny Velcro tabs . I watch as she changes a green parrot into the Incredible Hulk , tiny padded muscles and all . Claudia has her mouth on my cock . I look down at her . I do n't feel anything . Maybe it is the coke or the pot or maybe it is Claudia . Maddy used to do all right . Claudia is just sort of mouthing my penis , biting at it with her lips . Claudia lifts my hand and puts it between her legs , closes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crotch , but now that it has come down to it , I do n't know how to treat her like a whore . I find myself thinking of my mother , so I close my eyes and try thinking of Maddy instead , of this certain smooth spot on her back , right at the base of her spine , where I always held on to her . I start to get hard . But then I remember that Maddy is with Roberto , who at this very moment may be touching her there . " Do n't , " I say before I think not to say it . <p> Claudia raises her head . She looks at my limp , wrinkled cock , then at me . Her eyes widen . She smiles , a strange knowing smile as if she is seeing me , really seeing me , for the first time . <p> " Claudia , " I start , reaching for her . Her upper lip curls . Whatever she is seeing fills her with disgust . I do n't know what is going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is like she has switched channels in her head . One minute I 'm a coke dealer and then ... <p> " You do like women , " she says slowly . " Yes ? " I shake my head Yes , yes . Then suddenly I remember the time Roberto and I got very drunk at his apartment and how he tried to choke me . I think by way of starting to have sex with me . But I did n't get hard then , either . Really . Not at all . I threw up . I feel Claudia 's eyes changing me into something I 'm not . I am on my feet , backing across the room . " Stop it , " I say . Her lips are pursed . Whatever she is about to say , I do n't want to hear it . I reach for the doorknob , wrench the door open . <p> " Faggot ! " she says , spitting . " Brazilian faggot . " <p> I am in the lobby , and then in the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , spin west . I enter a town , am out of it before I think to slow down . I think instead about stealing the BMW , driving south to see Maddy . What would Maddy say if I told her about Roberto ? Probably , she would n't believe me . Brazilian faggot . <p> My headlights flash on a road sign : Brazil 3 miles . For a second I feel like I have entered the Twilight Zone , then I realize it is just an Indiana town . Still , I start looking for a place to make a U-turn , but before I know it I am in Brazil . Storefronts close in on both sides . I hit the gas , trying to get through as quickly as possible , fast-forward through this particular town . The downtown opens up , and a car lot blurs by . Then , a second too late , I see the cruiser sitting in the corner of the lot , nose on the edge of the road . The cop turns on his light . I hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I pull over on the edge of town , behind the Welcome to brazil sign . The cruiser pulls up behind me . The officer comes to the window , motions me out of the car . " Up early or out late ? " he says . He takes my Florida driver 's license without comment , calls that and the BMW in . Standing between the two cars , I can see he 's not a highway patrolman but a Brazil cop , probably the Brazil cop . He comes back with my license . He is frowning , tapping a big silver flashlight against one leg . I feel totally straight now , as dearheaded as an Olympic diver about to go off the high board . <p> volunteer that the car belongs to my aunt . " We 'll know all that soon enough , son . In the meantime , why do n't you just stretch your legs He shines his long silver flashlight down the edge of the road , along the white line he wants me to walk . <p> I can and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has me touch my index fingers to my nose with my eyes shut . " Fine , son , " the officer says . His radio squeals , and he goes to answer it . When he comes back , he is frowning , tapping the flashlight against one leg . " Why do n't you show me the registration for this car , son . " I blink , start to shrug . " The glove compartment , " he suggests . He turns on his flashlight . I get in the car , reach across the seat , and just as my fingers touch the latch , I remember with a flash of fear that goes through every cell of my body like some cocaine antihigh that the glove box is where I made Claudia put her gun . This is it , I think , the moment when amnesia turns serious , Sonny shoots Tubbs , this cop shoots me , but it is too late to stop . I open the glove box . <p> No gun . For a second I think I am going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her purse before we went up to the room . I grab the papers that are in the glove box , give them to the officer . " Your aunt ... " <p> " Claudia , " I say . <p> " Claudia Vanderhagen ? " he asks . He shows me the registration . William Vanderhagen . <p> " Yes , " I say . " But she 's divorcing Uncle Bill . He drinks . " The cop nods . " I 'm not sure he knows that she 's ... " <p> " Listen he says . " You 're a DePauw kid , right ? " He sees me hesitate , holds up his hand . " You 're scared because one call to Dean Bunche and your butt is on the line DePauw . A college or a prep school ? " But I know how you boys are . Get your hands on a car  --  say your aunt brings you up to school , turns in early  --  and you just got ta blow off steam . No harm done , but listen " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 'd been drinking , I would have to call Dean Bunche , and she 'd have to suspend you . Then what would you do ? Where would you be if you were n't in college ? " He gives my shoulder a squeeze . " Think about it . " I nod , my mouth too dry to talk . He gives back my license , writes me a sixty-dollar speeding ticket . " You drive nice and slow back to the frat house , " he says , " and tell the other boys all about this . Tell ' em I said to watch out when they drive through Brazil He pronounces it Braise-L . <p> I watch as the cruiser makes a careful U-turn , heads back into town , leaving me standing somewhere in the middle of America . America . A place where parking attendants from Miami and frat boys in Indiana dress just like Columbian coke dealers who all dress like an actor on TV who used to date Barbra Streisand . I rest my head on the hood of Claudia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where I am if I am not in college  --  nowhere . When I hit the bypass I think again about heading south , stealing the BMW , and driving straight to Florida State , not to see Maddy but to register for the fall term , but <p> do n't . I can see in my mind 's eye how many police there are between Indianapolis and Florida , and I know in my heart they will not be like the cop in Brazil . I feel a profound awareness of having used up my luck . I will take a bus . <p> The sun is coming up behind the convention center when I pull into the hotel parking lot , and it occurs to me that since I have been with Claudia , I have seen the sun rise more days than not , maybe more times than I have seen it in my life . The lobby is empty , no one behind the desk , but when I step out of the elevator on my floor , I see the bellboy coming out of Claudia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untied . He sees me , and for <p> moment he starts the other way , but we can both see that there is nothing at the end of the corridor but a fire escape . He decides to brave it out , walks toward me smiling . He really has no chin . I hold the elevator door with one hand , then when he is inside , let it go . He opens his mouth to say something , but the closing door cuts him off . <p> I let myself into my room . The bed is still made , one pillow a little wrinkled where I slept through the afternoon . I hear the shower next door shut off , the toilet flush . The phone rings . " You have my keys , " Claudia says . She sounds cool . <p> " I 'll meet you in the lobby , Mrs. Vanderhagen , " I say . <p> " Paulo ? " she says . <p> " Yes ? " <p> " I let him fuck me in the ass . " <p> I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in the elevator with the keys in one hand . All the clothes Claudia bought me , I leave behind in the room . But when I get to the lobby no Claudia , just a group of senior citizens standing looking out through the double glass doors . I come up behind them . There is an ambulance in the parking lot . A white-haired woman in a purple pantsuit turns to me . " Heart attack , " she says , sounding excited . As we watch , a paramedic slams the rear doors , and the ambulance pulls away , red light flashing . <p> The bellboy comes up behind me . " Wan na know which hospital ? " he says . He grins . And then it hits me . It was Claudia , Claudia in the ambulance . <p> I listen as he tells me how to get to the hospital , but then I ask him where the Greyhound station is . The bellboy looks at me , then snorts , as if I have let him in on a joke . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in spite of my intentions , I drive past it . I ca n't leave without a word . I am not my father . <p> In the emergency room I have to tell them I am Claudia 's son before they will send me up to cardiac care . " Five minutes , " the doctor there says , holding up that many fingers . Claudia is in one of several glass cubicles watched by a nurse near the door . She is resting with her eyes closed , one tube up her nose , another running liquid into her arm , and she is wired to one of those machines that makes each heartbeat into a game of follow-the-bouncing-ball . <p> I sit carefully on the edge of the bed . The heart monitor beeps softly . She opens her eyes . She does n't look rich or exotic now , she looks old and tired , more than ever like my mother . She gives me her hand , and I am surprised to find I am crying . <p> " They called my husband , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you . " Then she is crying , too , stiff sobs that hurt , make her monitor jump , the nurse start from her desk toward our glass room . <p>
