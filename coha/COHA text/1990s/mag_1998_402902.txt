/Jan 1999 At a time when many art groups must struggle to stay solvent , INTUIT : The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art in Chicago is celebrating a milestone . The rapidly expanding nonprofit organization , founded in 1991 by a group of artists , gallery owners and collectors , has moved from its small storefront location to a 7 , ooo-square-foot gallery space at 756 North Milwaukee Avenue on the city 's Near North West Side . Intuit has ridden a wave of international interest in outsider art . The French artist Jean Dubuffet pioneered the collecting of what he called art brut , or " raw art , " to characterize the creations of children , the mentally ill and others outside of society , such as isolates or prison inmates . But the center 's executive director , Jeff Cory , who oversees a $250,000 annual budget , says the term " outsider " has expanded beyond Dubuffet 's definition , to include " work by artists who are self-taught but also are inspired by their own unique personal visions , rather than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of support for outsider art , which is one explanation for Intuit 's quick rise . Local interest originated with a group of Chicago artists who exhibited together as the " Monster Roster " during the 1940s and 1950s . This group-including Seymour Rosofsky , H. C. Westermann and Leon Golub-worked in a surrealist/expressionist mode and studied art by " primitives , " the self-taught and the mentally ill . This generation then influenced the Chicago Imagists  --  Roger Brown , Gladys Nilsson , Jim Nutt , Karl Wirsum , Ed Paschke , Ray Yoshida and Don Baum  --  who collected and supported outsider art . These artists discovered three of the giants of outsider art : Joseph Yoakum , Martin Ramirez and Henry Darger . Brown , Nilsson and Baum also went on to help found Intuit . Intuit has a reputation for lively events , especially tours of member 's art collections and folk environments , film festivals and lectures . It has collaborated with the city to produce exhibitions at the Chicago Cultural Center-one , " Outsider Art : An Exploration of Chicago Collections " ( December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also initiated art education programs with social service organizations and a number of public schools . To celebrate the grand opening of the new facility , on October 3 , Intuit staged an auction of carnival ball-toss , or knock-down , figures created by outsider and contemporary artists , including Baum , Howard Finster , Mr. Imagination , Nilsson and Mose Tolliver . The inaugural exhibition , " Home : Places and Spaces " ( to December 31 ) , is a collection of two- and three-dimensional objects by outsider artists focusing on the concept of home in honor of Intuit 's new quarters . Also on view is " Don Wainwright : Christian 's People " ( to January 23 ) , which shows the reclusive New Mexico sculptor 's life-size wood constructions of animal and human figures .
