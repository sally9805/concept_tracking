<p> It is well after dark on a recent evening , but the red brick garment factory on a bluff overlooking the Sea of Japan is ablaze with light . From inside the building comes a haunting song , unfamiliar in this overwhelmingly Russian city : the seamstresses are singing in Chinese . <p> Of the many incongruities born of the increasingly complex global economy , this may be among the strangest . For here at Russia 's eastern extremity , Chinese workers labor alongside Russians making clothes for a South Korean company , which put its factory here partly to do an end run around United States quotas on apparel imports . <p> And Russia , which had visions of reinventing itself as a world-class market economy , now finds itself in the company of nations like Indonesia and El Salvador , attractive to outside investors in part for its rock-bottom wages . Seamstresses here often work six days a week , and for as little as 11 cents an hour . <p> The factory is owned by S. H. International , one of a growing number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case T-shirts and sweatshirts , that often end up in American stores like the Gap . <p> Similar factories have popped up in 10 cities in the Russian Far East , from the hardscrabble town of Partizansk , where three of the four coal mines have closed in the last two years , to Vladivostok , a port city of 700,000 that until 1992 was off-limits to foreigners . <p> American apparel companies have long farmed out work to manufacturers in low-wage countries . But in an elaborate global system known as the Multi-Fiber Arrangement , which is supposed to be dismantled by 2005 , the United States , like Europe , established restrictions on imports from countries whose exports were thought to threaten the domestic apparel industry . South Korean textile companies , limited by American quotas for decades , have sent their cloth to be sewn in faraway factories in the Caribbean and Latin America , which face no such quotas . But now South Koreans are finding a new place to set up shop . <p> " Through other countries such as Russia you can enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Kernaghan , director of the National Labor Committee , an industry watchdog group based in New York . <p> For Russia , the apparel companies are a double-edged sword . They provide jobs in a region desperate for investment , and in some cases they reopen closed Soviet-era factories . But some critics fear that the presence of Chinese laborers living on factory grounds is an invitation for the sweatshop conditions common to many South Korean factories in Latin America . <p> " There 's not much good in the whole arrangement , but there 's a deficit of jobs here , " said Aleksandr Prosekov , deputy chairman of the Committee for Industry in the Primorye Regional Administration , which includes Vladivostok . " At least they pay salaries regularly . " <p> The United States is unlikely to object to the imports from Russia . A Commerce Department official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said the practice was legal as long as there was " substantial transformation " of the clothing in Russia . Furthermore , she said , the United States will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not harm American industry . While the United States does set limits on imports of women 's and girls ' coats , there are no such limits on the production of clothing of the sort made here , polo shirts , sweatshirts and sweaters , which is growing domestically as well . <p> Vladivostok is only 440 miles from Seoul , South Korea , but it offers a bargain-rate work force . The average hourly cost of an apparel industry employee in South Korea in 1998 was $2.69 , including wages , taxes and benefits , according to industry figures . Though that seems stingy compared with the $10.12 United States average , the average Russian hourly cost is just 56 cents . <p> The Russian figure is less than half that of Guatemala , where the majority of sewing factories are owned by South Koreans , and comparable to China 's , where employers say apparel workers cost an average of 43 cents an hour . But exports from Russia , unlike those from China , face few trade restrictions . <p> These figures , low as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the National Labor Committee , which has studied wage rates in China and Latin America . And Eastern workers earn far less than the industry averages for Russia . Russian seamstresses at S. H. International , for example , earned 21 cents an hour on average when the regional administration 's Committee for Industry last surveyed local wages in October . The average Chinese worker at S. H. earned 11 cents an hour . S. H. 's general director , Hak J. Lee , declined to discuss specific figures at the factory . <p> The issue of outsourcing  --  farming out work to outside manufacturers  --  is a sensitive one for American companies , which have been criticized over labor practices of their producers abroad . A Gap Inc. spokeswoman , Kristy Van Koughnet , declined to answer questions about the company 's suppliers in Russia and said that questions relating to employment practices should be addressed to the factories in Russia . " Anything about where we outsource is considered proprietary information , " she said . <p> After a reporter asked about conditions in Russian factories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plant in Partizansk , workers then began receiving free lunch in the canteen , and the company increased wages . After the raise , one worker said she received $49.56 for a month that included several six-day work weeks . <p> The apparel makers have set up shop in unlikely places . Partizansk , a town of 65,000 three hours by car from Vladivostok , might not seem an ideal multinational manufacturing and trade center . Pensioners wheezing from black lung disease pick through heaps of stones outside abandoned mine shafts , looking for coal to burn . <p> But the Seoul-based Seishin Apparel Company bought and remodeled a bankrupt Soviet-era clothing factory there in 1997 for $760,000 to expand sales in America , its general director , Joo In Ha , said . The Russian subsidiary , Koruss , sold $1.68 million worth of sweatshirts , dresses and polo shirts to Gap in 1998 . <p> Vera Karas , a manager at Koruss , said the regional administration initially resisted the company , fearing it might exploit workers . " But that 's not going to happen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory when it was Russian-owned , said that the Korean owners treated employees well and hired some Russian managers , like her . Since last May , she added , wages have more than doubled . ( When figured in dollars , though , they have actually fallen as the ruble collapsed . ) <p> Some 600 cutters , seamstresses and others work at tables in Koruss 's warehouse-sized rooms , cutting piles of fabric and sewing dresses , sweatshirts , sweaters and polo shirts . Most of them are Russian women ; some of the new hires are Chinese . They regularly work five 9- or 10-hour days , and often spend Saturdays at the sewing machines as well . Koruss employees are paid extra for overtime work , but at S. H. International in Vladivostok , workers said their overtime pay an hour was less than their regular hourly pay . <p> While filling a big order in November , Koruss employees worked several seven-day weeks , they said . ( Ms. Karas said this was untrue . ) <p> " You can only go to the toilet when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee who quit after a month . " If they catch you talking , you get in trouble . " She added : " Sometimes we did n't leave until 7 P.M. For those who have families , I do n't know how they do it . " <p> Some employees , however , say the work is very welcome . Lyubov Vonyagina , 54 , a veteran seamstress , is part of a team that must produce 1,900 T-shirts a day . When they fall short , they stay late . Still , Ms. Vonyagina says she is not overworked , and she scoffs at younger workers who complain . " They are n't used to hard work , " she said . <p> The decision to hire Chinese workers has stirred up anger in some factory towns . City officials in Artyom , 22 miles north of Vladivostok , have criticized a request by Newmax Apparel of South Korea to hire 75 Chinese workers , the daily Vladivostok newspaper reported on Tuesday . Officials also asked the company to double wages and stop requiring seamstresses to work overtime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northeastern China because , said Mr. Joo , the general director , there are simply not enough skilled workers in Partizansk to fill orders . But some townspeople are hostile to the idea . <p> " We do n't need the Chinese here , " said Lyudmila Samoilova , 43 , a single mother of five who runs a newspaper kiosk across the street from Koruss . " There are n't enough jobs for our own people . " <p> Nina Gudozhnikova , director of the Partizansk office of the federal employment service , worries that because Chinese workers at home put in 12-hour days and get only two days off a month , the South Korean factories in Russia will impose similar schedules on its workers . Still , she approved the factory 's labor agreement because the women of Partizansk need jobs . " I signed this agreement with serious doubts , " she said . <p> In Vladivostok , at S. H. International , which is owned by the Sunghan Company , 384 Russians work alongside 218 Chinese employees , according to Sergei Kurakin , chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China said they lived on the plant site and worked about 10 hours a day . Like many Chinese traders and workers in the Russian Far East , they say they will be here only for a short time . <p> Russian workers said the Chinese struck for two days in December because of low wages . But the Chinese , who said they could get in trouble for talking about their work , declined to discuss the matter . " Basically , I came to Russia out of curiosity , as well as to earn some money , " one seamstress said . <p> At a time when most unpaid Russian workers survive on what they can grow in their gardens or borrow from their pensioner parents , many seamstresses are grateful that South Korean companies are investing in the region . Others say they simply must take whatever work they can get . A 30-year-old mother of two complained of a dirty work environment , and a boss who blocked the doors at S. H. and refused to allow employees to leave at the end of their shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I did n't do that . " Like other South Korean companies , S. H. said it followed Russian labor laws . <p> In any case , the worker who complained plans to keep showing up on the job . " We have no choice , " she said . " We either have to sit at home and go hungry , or go to work in these conditions .
