<p> Kids , Guns , Tragedy , In cities all over America teenagers are killing and maiming each other . A bleak portrait of violence and fear among American school children was reported by a Harris survey of 2,508 students from 96 schools . Forty percent of these children knew someone who had been killed or injured by a gun . Although teen violence is often associated with inner cities , it now pervades almost every community , large and small , in the United States . <p> South Bend , Indiana is no exception . In one year 's time , a seven-year-old was killed on his own porch ; a high school basketball star was shot ; a first grader brought a gun to school . In a city of 100,000 , both the victims and perpetrators of handgun violence are getting younger and younger . <p> For the past 12 years , I have been a judge assigned to felony cases in the South Bend , Indiana St. Joseph Superior Court . I listen to sobbing mothers testify to the pain in their hearts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenager I am about to sentence as an adult to a prison term of over 50 years . I sometimes leave the bench and cry too . The criminal justice system alone can not stop the killing . Our communities need programs that reach our children before they reach their teens or a court of law . It takes a whole village to raise a child in safety . <p> THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD  --  NO SHOOTING ALLOWED was created in 1993 to help teach children alternative ways to solve problems and gain protection . In less than one year , the project has grown into a community-wide volunteer effort to give children a chance to change the attitudes of their peers about gun violence and build pride in their neighborhoods . It has reached 7,000 school age children in classrooms and tens of thousands of TV viewers in their homes this spring . What follows is a diary of the project taken from my calendar . July 1993 <p> In July of 1993 , over lunch hours , friends helped with ideas on how to reach kids . A Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teen violence . Noreen Howard , a recently retired administrator in the Prosecutor 's Office , saw first hand the devastation caused by crack houses , teens who carried weapons for protection , and the idea that guns are " cool . " She focused on neighborhood improvement . Mary Roemer , a counselor and former teacher , contributed the notion of kids teaching kids . We all agreed that movies , pictures , drawings , plays and stories are the ways to get kids to change their thinking about violence . We decided to start in the elementary schools and middle schools of the South Bend Community School Corporation . We needed help . We had no money or volunteers . August <p> In August THIS IS MY NEIGHBOR-HOOD  --  NO SHOOTING ALLOWED applied for a Criminal Justice Grant . By then , the project 's objectives and methodology had been clarified as discussed below . <p> To give children the chance to change the attitudes of their peers and neighbors by : increasing community awareness and emphasizing disapproval of the use of weapons as a solution to problems ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introducing children to the criminal justice system as an institution that protects children from violence and promotes equitable solutions to problems ; uniting children to work toward viewing guns as instruments of tragedy instead of symbols of glamour . <p> The project would involve the entire community , encompassing schools , local businesses and media , and volunteer service organizations . A series of coordinated activities  --  such as a teen think tank , high school theatrical productions , a mock jury , an art display , photography and classroom discussions  --  were planned . <p> It was decided that all of South Bend Community School Corporation 's elementary schools , middle schools and high schools would be involved in project activities culminating during Law Week in May 1994 . At this time , South Bend children would display what they had learned about guns , the criminal justice system , and their responsibilities to each other . <p> I talked to community leaders and enlisted the help of friends who talked to more people . Soon the Superintendent of the South Bend Community School Corporation agreed to introduce us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor , the Chief of Police , the President of the Bar Association , the Prosecutor , the United Religious Community , the South Bend Heritage Foundation , and the South Bend Regional Art Center all joined in support of the proposal . September <p> " Leadership " is a program sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce to involve citizens in their community 's organizations and activities . In September , Leadership 's Executive Director , Patricia Cressy , extended an invitation to present THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD  --  NO SHOOTING ALLOWED to the young business and professional volunteers of Leadership . She reported : " Our participants consider teen violence to be the greatest problem in the community . " <p> The government grant was rejected in favor of " more practical programs . " Fortunately , at the Leadership Retreat on September 26th , thirteen people volunteered to accept the challenge to raise money and organize THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD  --  NO SHOOTING ALLOWEGBD in the schools and community . October <p> October 1 , 1993 's editorial in the South Bend Tribune , " Rejecting Violence , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The editorial stated , <p> " Children are n't born with an innate urge to use guns and commit acts of violence . Turning to violence as a means of settling disputes or venting anger is something that people are taught . What is needed is more adults who are willing to teach children a different lesson  --  the reward of rejecting violence . " <p> Throughout the month of October , I looked for more adults willing to help . Jane Becker , Chief Deputy Prosecuting Attorney , and Larry Bennett , Chief of the Patrol Division of the South Bend Police Department , volunteered to provide lawyers and police officers to help develop a Mock Jury Program for middle school social studies classes . The principal of Riley High School introduced me to John Kauss , whose creative writing students agreed to write one-act plays on teens and gun violence . Bowsher-Booher Foundation awarded Leadership a grant of $3,000 to be used to fund the Art Center 's multi-dimensional art display to be created by sixth graders . <p> Jim Behling , President and General Manager of the WNDU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on teen violence ? " I answered , " How can we stay on the sidelines and watch ? We need to try . " WNDU agreed to produce a video on a teen shooting for use by the Mock Jury . All month long at breakfast or lunch , I met with Leadership volunteers who expressed their interest and agreed to assume responsibility for parts of the program . November <p> In November , Sherral Littel , from Leadership , and I met with teachers to seek their ideas on classroom activities for K to fourth grade . At the end of the month , Linda Brookshire , an English Curriculum Specialist at the South Bend Community School Corporation , unlocked the key to teacher access and lesson plan preparation . She reminded us that each teacher is autonomous , busy and confronted with requests for class time . Thus , success depended upon providing teachers with all necessary materials , presenting the lesson plans at a teacher staff meeting , and signing teachers up then and there . December <p> In December , Leadership 's Julie Schwartz raised $16,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank for five thousand dollars each , In addition , TCI of Michiana donated 400 disposable cameras . January 1994 <p> January was devoted to preparing the lesson plans for Kindergarten to fifth grade . Noreen decided to use a grocery bag labeled with the name of the school , teacher and grade . Inside the bag , we included a lesson plan and any special materials necessary to implement the plan . Kindergarten through second graders received the book " Goldilocks and the Three Bears , " along with a lock , the phone number 911 , a court summons , a toy gun and play money . Children in these grades listened to the story and , using the bag as a grab-bag , reached into it for solutions to the bear 's dilemma of how to treat Goldilocks . <p> The third grade bag contained photographs with poster board and drawing paper . The photographs showed city streets at war or at peace . The instructions asked kids to make a collage and then to draw their own street and write about the safe and scary places . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The fourth grade bag had a book , " Legend of Blue Bonnet , " with instructions for the child to read the story and discuss how to help people in the neighborhood and then to write the Mayor about the child 's neighborhood and tell him how the neighborhood could be improved . <p> The fifth grade bag contained a camera for each child with instructions to take photographs of people and places in the neighborhood . After Leadership developed the film from these cameras , the kids and teachers were asked to return negatives of their favorites for a photography show . Sixth graders were invited to build an display on Saturdays . February <p> In February , 45 sixth graders began to work on a multi-dimensional art display reflecting the theme , THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD  --  NO SHOOTING ALLOWED . They were assisted by Bill and Julie Tourtilotte and Jeff Silverthorne . Each of the sixth grade artists designed a four by four foot panel and came to the Art Center every Saturday until their part of the eight by eighty foot display was completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his or her panel . <p> In February , I wrote principals , enclosing copies of THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD NO SHOOTING ALLOWED lesson plans and asking permission to have Leadership volunteers give a ten minute presentation at a school staff meeting during February or March . Leadership volunteers spoke at over half of the school corporation 's elementary schools . The lesson plans and goals of the program were well received by teachers , who often expressed their concerns about the impact of violence on their students . March <p> The March winds were quiet on Saturday , the 19th , the day that 400 fifth graders took snapshots of their neighborhoods . Noreen Howard picked up the cameras , had the film developed through the generosity of Qualex and returned the nearly 9,600 pictures . Later in the month , a group of volunteer photography buffs from the Park Department pored over those shots the fifth grade classes had decided were the best from which to select the final 250 photographs for display . The photographs showed that 10-year-olds love flags , parks , churches , dogs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March also brought a dozen one act plays written by Riley High School students . The one-act play , " The Invisible Man " by Matt Andrysiak , was selected by Leadership for performance . Teenage inmates at the Indiana Community Based Correctional Facility , DuComb Center , agreed to produce and perform the four roles in the play . <p> On March 26th at St. Mary 's College , THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD  --  NO SHOOTING ALLOWED held its first event , the Teen Think Tank . Fifty-two high school students from 13 area high schools were referred by Urban Youth , Youth Leadership , the South Bend Tribune Teens , principals of six high schools and the coordinator for drug education in the school system . In the morning , the students listened to and talked with college professors from Notre Dame and Indiana University at South Bend . <p> In the afternoon , with Notre Dame law students acting as facilitators , the teens discussed and presented their suggestions to community leaders . They highlighted the following ideas for the police and courts : The problems are gangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some suggested solutions include holding police assemblies at schools ; making a hotline available for students who see guns or drugs in school ; and being able to anonymously talk to police and ask what to do . <p> The Mayor was told : " Get police to walk the beat and get more acquainted with the neighborhoods . If police get out of the car , they can establish a relationship with the community . Provide us volunteer work possibilities to get students more involved and take ownership for improvement of the community . " <p> According to participants , the most important concepts learned were : " Teens really do care " ; " Teens can help " ; " I need to act on how I feel " ; " No guns " ; " Students attending this session need to get out and talk to people about what we learned . " Two teens at the workshop , Ted Williams of St. Joseph High School and Melvin Milon of Clay High School , volunteered to be the victim and offender in the video to be filmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which one teen shoots another was created for middle school students ' Mock Trials . The video follows two teens through the shooting 's consequences and concludes with a trial , after which the middle school students act as mock jurors and render a verdict in the case . In April , WNDU 's Mike Jones produced the video THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD  --  NO SHOOTING ALLOWED . Leadership found volunteers for every role in the video . There were no actors : South Bend police , paramedics , doctors , nurses , judges , lawyers and teens played themselves . The sets were an actual basketball court , emergency room and courtroom in South Bend . The tragedy portrayed on film was one every adult in the video had experienced on the job . No one needed a script . <p> The Young Lawyers of the Bar Association , Jane Becker , Deputy Prosecutor , and Larry Bennett of SBPD were able to obtain the assistance of more than 70 volunteer lawyers and police , who conducted Mock Trials . Thirty-five hundred students from the city 's six middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Forever Learning Institute , a continuing education program for senior citizens , provided a location and the volunteers to assemble instructions and materials for kindergarten to fourth grade activities . <p> The United Religious Community sponsored an afternoon workshop at Broadway Christian Church on April 26th . The United Religious Community 's commitment to peer mediation training was explained and renewed . May <p> The Mock Trials took place during Law Week , May 1-6 , 1994 . For 16 minutes , the mock jurors sat mesmerized as the video was played . When the tape ended , the police-bailiff and lawyer-judge divided the class into 12 person juries and handed out jury instructions and verdict forms . <p> Deliberations over the guilt of the teen shooter were heated , provoking such comments as : " He was stupid . " " He was scared . " " He needed the gun for protection . " " The victim is paralyzed . " " You saw his face ; he did n't want to kill anybody . " " What did he think a bullet in the chest would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken . Classes differed ; most were split  --  torn between guilty of Attempted Murder or Battery . <p> Kids left class shaken at the severity of the penalty for the shooter . Fortunately , many teachers spent time before and after the mock jury class talking about the law , courts , and alternatives to violence . An anonymous Clay Middle School student commented : " I know what to do . Never talk up . Do n't draw attention to yourself . Never join a group you do n't know on the block . Hear shots . Lay down fast . " <p> At Head Start and elementary schools , such activities as stories , drawings , and letter writing were conducted during Law Week . Among the suggestions in the letters were : " Dear Mayor , build a park here . " " Dear Mayor , my neighborhood is pretty nice . You should fix up the crummy houses though . " Third graders ' drawings showed houses with smoke pollution or sunny parks with children playing . One had a house circled and a promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another drawing marked the house of " a man who tries to touch me . " We were shocked to learn that nearly 4% of the kids were drawing crimes in their neighborhood ! <p> On May 4th , THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD  --  NO SHOOTING ALLOWED celebrated in the Great Hall of Century Center in downtown South Bend . Amid balloons and banners , fifth and sixth graders proudly showed parents , grandparents and teachers the results of their Saturday creativity . At the photography exhibit , 250 photographs were on display . In the Little Theater , DuComb Center players packed the house . Teens who months before were convicted of felonies were now in a play . Their fellow DuComb Center " residents " took front row seats . Participants asked : " Can we do this again ? " " Think little kids in school would like us to do this for them ? " " Will we get a T-shirt to keep ? " Barbara Johnston , a paralegal with the prosecutor 's office , kept shaking her head : " Who knows . Maybe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both local television stations featured THIS IS MY NEIGHBOR-HOOD  --  NO SHOOTING ALLOWED . WNDU-TV used clips of the video and produced a teen talk show on guns in schools . During May , WSBT-TV aired public service announcements of children telling viewers , " This is my neighborhood . No shooting allowed . " On May 18th , Rhonda Brown of WSBT produced a town meeting during prime time called , " Growing Up Scared - Children and Violence . " <p> A gun exchange was held in a city park during this broadcast as a part of THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD  --  NO SHOOTING ALLOWED . The exchange was coordinated by volunteers from churches and police agencies who had joined together because they were concerned about gun violence and who connected with Leadership early in the spring and added this dimension to the program . WSBT-TV also featured a half hour talk show in which Leadership 's Cindy Eastman , SBPD Juvenile Officer Lynn Coleman , and I explained what teens , parents and neighbors can do to reduce violence . " Love your kids . Spend time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of May , Leadership volunteers and contributors were feted by the Common Council of South Bend . The suggestions of the Teen Think Tank and third graders ' drawings were presented to the Council . <p> THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD  --  NO SHOOTING ALLOWED operated on a budget of $13,000 and donations of time , talent and materials . Despite the major distraction of a teachers ' strike during February , the teachers of public elementary and middle schools opened their classrooms to give kids a chance to teach their peers and neighbors to reject violence as a way to solve problems . The program set the stage for expanding peer mediation programs in South Bend Community School Corporation elementary schools and the United Religious Community 's mediation training programs . Schools , banks and civic center activities have continued to show the art and photography exhibit so the children 's message THIS IS MY NEIGHBOR-HOOD  --  NO SHOOTING ALLOWED will continue through 1994 . <p> In late May , local stations covered news that a gun was discovered at a local middle school . A teen from that school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Judge , my class saw THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD 'S film . This was n't the first time there was a gun at our school . Before , we kept it a secret . Now we know we have to speak up before somebody gets hurt .
