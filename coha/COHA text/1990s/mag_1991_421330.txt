Route 66 , soon to be commemorated by the Park Service , symbolizes the nation 's love affair with the open road <p> SOMEWHERE ALONG the ribbon of decaying asphalt and concrete that extends from Chicago to Santa Monica  --  a road commonly known as U.S. Route 66  --  is Seligman , Arizona , a dusty town with nearly 1,000 residents and Delgadillo 's Barber Shop . It is here that every Tuesday through Saturday at 9 a.m. , armed with a straight-edge razor , sharp shears , and a bottle of lemon creme aftershave , Angel Delgadillo puts on a white apron and begins his work behind the stainless steel barber 's chair that once belonged to his father . For five dollars a cut , you may not find salon styling and glossy magazines to read while you wait , but you do get to spend a few relaxing minutes with Delgadillo . And for one dollar more , you can have an old-fashioned head massage . <p> " There 's so much congeniality in my barbershop , so much is discussed here  --  just family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try not to let religion and politics get too thick . I 've been in this shop for 40 years and I 'm still what a barber was years ago . " <p> Delgadillo is just one of the many " mom and pop " old-timers living and working along America 's Main Street-U.S . Route 66 , the two-lane road thousands of travelers once followed in search of America . To them , Route 66 symbolized 2,448 miles of hope and adventure . Now , more than 40 years since the establishment of the complex , multibillion-dollar interstate system that bypassed Route 66 in every direction , a congressional bill has authorized a two-year study to determine ways to preserve and commemorate this historic highway . <p> More than 80 percent of the original Route 66 is intact today . And although one-of-a-kind attractions like the Wigwam Motel in Rialto , California , and Cadillac Ranch where ten Cadillacs are planted Stonehenge-style , face down , in a field near Amarillo , Texas-have been replaced by a monoculture of fast-food joints and chain hotels , America 's passion for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Route 66 traverses  --  Illinois , Missouri , Kansas , Oklahoma , Texas , New Mexico , Arizona , and California  --  supports active Route 66 associations . The combined efforts of these grassroots organizations , the recent release of Route 66 : The Mother Road by Michael Wallis , and legislation to preserve 66 , introduced by Senator Pete Domenici ( R-New Mexico ) , all have contributed to the " 66 Fever " that is sweeping the nation . <p> Americans always have looked to the Western states as the land of gold and adventure . The great urge to " Go West , young man , " which began as early as 1800 , continued in great waves into the first half of this century . Route 66 traces those trails blazed by Native Americans , golddiggers , claimstakers , and pioneers as they headed toward the Pacific Coast . By 1926 , around the time the National Highway System Act created Route 66 , Fords and other automobiles were available at such a price that many Americans could finally afford to substitute four-legged travel for four wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair with the open road shifted into fifth gear . <p> In the next few decades , Route 66 , along with other transcontinental highways , would lead the country west . In the first mass exodus , the sons and daughters of the Dust Bowl fled the parched farmlands of the Midwest and Southwest during the Great Depression . The next important wave of travelers came after World War II as factories in Detroit stopped making trucks and tanks in favor of automobiles . For the first time in history , the unionized autoworkers received two weeks paid vacation and discounts on the cars they produced . Touring America via 66 became a national pastime . <p> " As the first major highway going across the United States , Route 66 still is in people 's minds , indelible in their spirits , " says Bruce Meyer , president of the Kansas Route 66 Association . " Route 66 means adventure . It represents a time when car travel was exciting . If you were going to go 200 miles , you did n't know if your car would break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether , beyond a certain point , there would be dragons . " <p> What also makes traveling Route 66 an adventure is the odd assortment of restaurants , motels , and tourist attractions that interrupts the scenery along the road . " When you walk into a Route 66 cafe , you do n't know if you are going to get ptomaine poisoning or find a feast , " says author Michael Wallis . " It 's not predictable , unlike the generic , cookie-cutter culture of interstate highways . " <p> To Wallis and thousands of others , Route 66 is our last link to the time of waitresses named Mac , homemade cherry pies , Burma Shave signs , porch swings , neon storefronts , and driving below the speed limit . " If you want to make time and go lickety-split , by all means take the interstate , " Wallis says . " But if you want to see genuine America , if you find time holy and want to rediscover yourself  --  rediscover this country-take Route 66 . " <p> Never before has the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so it is only natural that the Route 66 project is the most ambitious of its kind , says David Gaines , NPS southwest chief of long-distance trails . Many of the existing partnership parks ( parks that are neither federally owned nor directly administered by the National Park Service but which employ NPS assistance )  --  such as the Delaware and Hudson Heritage Corridor Project in New York may span a couple hundred miles . The entire entity of Route 66 , however , crosses nearly two-thirds of the U.S. , making it one of the most extensive trails in the nation . Decades of travel along Route 66 and the highway 's contribution to American pop culture also add to the road 's significance . In addition , the project will be important for its examination of traditional national parks and cultural resources in the study of commercial archeology , notes Gaines . <p> Many national park sites focus on a particular event or a person of historical importance , but interpreting a 2,400 mile highway is a true twentieth-century phenomenon . Tom Snyder , founder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on the relationship between the public and private sectors . " Route 66 was nothing without commercial business . This will be different from anything the Park Service has ever done . " <p> Route 66 is a window into our history , but it is important for other reasons , Snyder adds . " You can point to the Okie migration and perhaps link history to it , but it 's not a historic highway in the same sense as the Boston Post Road or the Oregon Trail . Route 66 exists in a totally different plane of consciousness : it was the first highway to become a destination in itself . We started traveling to travel , not to go somewhere . " <p> The National Parks and Conservation Association supported legislation to study appropriate methods to commemorate Route 66 . In testimony before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources , Bruce Craig , NPCA cultural resources program manager , stated that " it is most important to assess the surviving roadside architecture including motels , restaurants , and gas stations " and comparatively evaluate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commemorate the Mother Road have peaked not a minute too soon . " Though Route 66 is seemingly recent , the American commercial environment regenerates itself so rapidly that the architectural and physical evidence of this roadside is often lost before it has been recorded , " reported the Society for Commercial Archaeology in a statement last June . " If swift action is taken , Route 66 can tell its own story . If we wait another generation , the story of Route 66 will be limited to published accounts and markers along the highway . " <p> For many travelers , Route 66 is a home away from home . That old road is a historic ribbon linking the lives of people going somewhere , seeing America , seeking their fortune . As Steinbeck wrote in The Grapes of Wrath , " 66 is the mother road , the road of flight . " <p> The following is a collection of impressions about life and travel along Route 66 . The Grand Tour <p> Pictured is our maiden voyage vehicle , a vintage Ford Touring Sedan that performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' 36 . For the staggering sum of $25 we acquired ownership , added a touring top , and took off via Route 66 . All of the passengers but me are now deceased , including mother , sister , husband , and faithful canine companion , " Pick . " <p> Five more treks across the country via Route 66 introduced poor pale-faces to rich Indians , lecherous ranchers , transient evangelists , aging prospectors , desert heat , and no air-conditioning . Our only assets were youth and hope . Marjorie Adams Lompoc , California <p> Cozy Dog <p> I was stationed in Old Amarillo , Texas , along 66 as a buck private . When we dropped the bomb on Japan , I was in the finance office , bored stiff . So I got to thinking that I had been in the food business before and had made a lot of donuts . Why could n't we get a weenie and dip it in a batter and cook it up like a donut ? <p> I had a friend who owned a bakery , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' era Crusty Curs . They were very popular . We put them in the PX on base and sold them at the USO in town . <p> After a couple of months I got discharged , and we moved out to Springfield . When my wife heard the name Crusty Cur , she said it was a horrible name for a hot dog on a stick . So she came up with the name Cozy Dog . And it stuck . Edwin Waldmire Owner , Cozy Drive-In Springfield , Illinois <p> The Dust Bowl <p> In the days of the Dust Bowl , I 'd have people in my rooms for more than a month at a time until we could get some help for them to go on down the road . I ended up with a yard full of cars from people like the migrant workers . They 'd have to sell their cars to go on . Or I 'd give them gasoline because I did n't have enough rooms in the motel to accommodate them all . Eventually , people started thinking this place was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the main highway in 1966 . That 's the year my daughter started college , so I started selling beer to survive . Most of the businesses pulled out , but I could n't do that . Now I 've got all these tourists and I 'm loving it . Lucille Hamons Owner , Hamons ' Service Station and Motel Hydro , Oklahoma <p> Political Cartoons <p> In the late ' 60s , I got out of college and eventually hitchhiked on Route 66 from St. Louis back to my parents ' who lived on 66 in California . At the time society had gotten very polarized  --  it was the " them against us " kind of thing . People started getting a little freaked out if your hair was too long , for instance . <p> I was in the middle of that , but this trip ended up being a very positive thing . Middle-class people in station wagons  --  women traveling with their sons  --  would stop and pick you up . That would n't happen today . Now only real oddballs stop for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy picked me up in Arizona in a ' 50 Chevy . We came up behind a Navajo Freight Line truck . For years and years , Navajo was probably the biggest freight company that ran up and down Route 66 . Their logo was a silhouette of what they called the blue-eyed Navajo . <p> The back end of the truck was very dirty  --  the Indian 's face was looking at us from behind all the dirt . Well , someone had taken his finger and drawn a balloon from the Indian 's mouth , as in cartoons . It said , " Me no like ' era Reagan . " <p> And that was 1967 . Terrence Moore Photographer Tuscon , Arizona <p> American Roots <p> Living along Main Street , as old Route 66 was known in Bloomington , Illinois , I joined the ranks of the converted and came to appreciate the roots of Americans displayed along the road . Route 66 meanders past Funks Grove , a green thicket of maple trees where generations of the Funk family have made syrup . Thousands of truckers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truckers Home just long enough to post a polaroid of themselves and their rigs on the bulletin board  --  a montage of tattoos , corn-fed bellies , and wide grins beneath truckers ' caps . <p> Farther along the road , the Bloomington Courthouse provided a scene for Lincoln 's " lost speech , " so-called because spellbound reporters , enraptured by his lyricism , forgot to take notes . <p> Route 66 saw the birth of the very first Steak ' n ' Shake , famous for steakburgers and the slogan , " It 's a meal . " The Falcon Restaurant featured a $1.99 breakfast special with biscuits and gravy that stay with you all day-sometimes for two or three days . Marian Quinlan NPCA Washington , D.C. <p> Kiss and Do n't Tell Motel <p> The Route 66 scenery in Missouri is the prettiest of all the states . There are still interesting things to do and see along the way . <p> In St. Louis , there 's Ted Drewes Frozen Custard , the 66 Park-In-Theatre , and the Coral Court . <p> The Coral Court is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " kiss and do n't tell " motel and it 's also on the National Register of Historic Sites . <p> The Court is absolutely gorgeous-1941 streamlined modern . All of the units have self-contained garages , so it keeps the grounds looking really nice . This is also one of the reasons it makes a perfect hideaway ; nobody can identify your license plate . <p> It would be terrible for me , though . My license plates say " HWY-66 " on them , so anyone could spot me easily . Jim Powell President , Missouri Rt . 66 Association St. Louis , Missouri <p> Pig Hip <p> One day a man came and asked for a sandwich from a pig 's hip , so we gave it to him . We found out later that the left hip was more tender than the right . When hogs scratch , they tend to lift their right leg , and that makes it more tough ; we let our competitors have it . We have our own little slaughterhouse here , and we buy direct from the farmer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I kept my door open to them , but it was n't allowed legally . There was a lot of controversy . We 'd have white people come and get upset when they saw the coloreds . I had a sign up that said , " We reserve the right to serve our patrons . " People would come in and ask what it meant . I said it means everybody is welcome . <p> But America today is more crude . People slurp at their soup and coffee . I say bring back Emily Post . <p> I 'm going on 74 and I 'd like to retire , but I 'm having too much fun . Ernie Edwards Pig Hip Restaurant Broadwell , Illinois <p> The Good Old Days <p> My father was in the service , and we drove Route 66 on assignments many times . I lived for the day when we could stop in those curio shops . I was constantly harassing my family to stop . <p> They also had those snake farms , animals , Indians ... I still have a bear claw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 12 years old . I 've always had it sitting on top of my dresser or hanging on the wall . I never wore it ; in the ' 50s , men did n't wear necklaces . A man could get away with wearing it these days . <p> Those were the days of ducktails , convertibles , and turned-up collars . Kids would drag around main street on Highway 66 in Albuquerque  --  not much drinking or drugs . Those were probably the good old days . David Couch San Antonio , Texas <p> Get Your Kicks <p> You ca n't leave out Bobby Troup 's song , " Get Your Kicks on Route 66 , " when talking about 66 . When I came across the country as a boy , the song was on all the jukeboxes . I would beg my folks for a nickel to play the song . Of course , they would n't allow me to have the money .
