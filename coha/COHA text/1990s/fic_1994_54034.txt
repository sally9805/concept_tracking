Section : FICTION The history of the duplicities of my ex-husband Stefan Erikson , if I wrote them all down , would be as thick as one of those impossible books with a title that begins with the word decline : Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , say , or Decline of the West . Every memory I have of him is double . Every word he ever said to me echoed decline and downfall , no matter what else may have been going through that white-boy tongue of his . He was , as my friend Armelia finally said , a perfect bastard . But worlds like perfect have a way of coming unstuck . It 's true that in all his bastardy Stefan was perfectly consistent . So . I suppose I ought to be able to forgive myself for believing , even for a second or two , that he was the perfect man . <p> My father knew better from the moment he first laid eyes on Stefan . It 's one of the cliches of bad relationships that other people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make more clearly than you do , and that you resent their clarity , most likely because deep down you know they 're right . I had taken Stefan to the club where my father was playing one Thursday night , and when I went up to the bandstand to give him a kiss between tunes  --  before he and Stefan had so much as exchanged a word  --  he looked down at me over the curve of his bass with those very cool jazzman 's eyes of his , and he whispered , " Yellow snow . " <p> Of course , I knew exactly what he meant . " Yellow snow , " he said , and that 's all he had to say to tip me off . Otherwise , he was his usual cool and pleasant self ; on break he had a drink at our table and made small talk in his chat-scat jazzman 's way . I was furious at him . He knew it , and the whole time he sat there in his very crisp tuxedo , he was laughing at me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What the hell 's your problem ? " Stefan said after my father had strolled over to talk to the drummer about the next set 's tunes . I looked at Stefan  --  oh , he was gorgeous , with his blue-eyed con man 's face  --  and for just a moment I saw him from my father 's angle , from above and back a little , as if I 'd spent : years on handstands in dark clubs , making ' beautiful sounds and watching ' the things people do to each other when they dance , and when they did n't dance . Right then , I did n't feel like telling Stefan what my problem was . <p> " My problem , " I said finally , " if I choose to have one , is my daddy . " <p> " Yeah ? " Stefan said with a little ironic grin that let me know thought I was acting like what he called a girl . " And what 's the deal with your old man ? " <p> " My old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He always looks like he knows what he wo n't say he knows , and he pisses me off to the nth degree . Other than that , " I said , " he 's just fine . " <p> It 's not an altogether easy thing growing up with a father who is as cool as my father always was . When I say cool , I mean it in a precise technical sense , and I have a right to use the word that way to talk about my father , since he was one of the pioneers of cool , one of its definers . I mean literally . Thomas " Golden " Brightman played with Miles and Duke and Hawk and Mill Jackson ; he backed up . Getz and Paul Desmond and Wes Montgomery . He always knew the inside dope , he always landed on his feet , he was always two or three steps ahead of you , he was always quiet and smart and on the off beat , funny from a long ways away , and he always knew the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of the song . In jazz , there are two kinds of people  --  the ones who know the changes , and the ones who do n't . The ones who do are heroes who can play anything they want inside the tune , can say anything and make it fit ; the ones who do n't are irredeemably worthless assholes , no matter how much technique they have . My father always knew the changes , and not just in songs ; he knew the changes in everything . He knew the changes in the stock market and the weather ; he knew the changes inside the head of God . He sure as hell knew the changes in my life , and he could always lay down a strong walking bass line way out ahead of anywhere I was . <p> I know now that he could do that because he always listened , the way a bass player has to listen , to feel what the tune is doing , what it 's about to do . If you understand the changes , it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid I said to him , not kindly  --  we were having one of our quiet little altercations  --  " How come you always know what I 'm going to say before I say it ? " He laughed at me then and told me , " Child , it 's easy . So far , you 're just a simple blues . " <p> The first time I met Stefan Erikson , he already knew I was the child of my father . In fact , he had come looking for me in the middle of a boring party , to pay , and I use the phrase loosely but not lightly , his respects . <p> " So you , " he said , " are Golden Brightman 's daughter . " <p> I looked at his archetypal blondness . He was a phony from the downbeat , but he was nice to look at . " You 're playing in 5/4 time , " I said . " B-flat . You 're right in tune . " <p> He narrowed his eyes and smiled ; a phony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Only when some pretty blond man at a honkie party comes on to me as Golden Brightman 's daughter . " <p> His eyebrows went up in a cartoon gesture of amazement . " Was I coming on to you ? " <p> " Triple forte , " I said , " with a hell of a mean left-handed syncopation . " <p> In bed with him that night , it occurred to me that I might fall in love . <p> I do not want it to be thought that I never loved God . I was a God-loving soul , but never God-fearing . I was brought up to love , but not to fear . In the first place , I was the child of my father and my mother . Later , I matriculated as a student of theology and archaeology . I was bright , and I was for all intents and purposes a member of an ethnic minority , so I was granted an excellent scholarship to an excellent university . I became , as a special honor for high academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was involved in the translation of the Nag Hammadi manuscripts of the Gnostic gospels from Coptic into English : I saw and handled photographs of those beautiful , bizarre pieces of papyrus ; I was one of a handful of people who knew at least something of their contents before they were finally published . I mention this to establish my credentials : I was hip early on to the bildungsroman of the noos ; I learned more or less at first hand in late adolescence the legend of that King Kong of the spirit world named the Demiurge by those weird desert-father mystics ; I knew by heart the archetype of the throwing of the spark of the human soul blindly into the void of material existence  --  what my Gnostic criminal saints , my sad nobodaddies of the history of heresy , called the henoma . Understand : I was not myself of a mystical turn of mind ; I was a student of the history of everything , a budding cosmologist who thought that maybe these long-lost doctrines of the flaming up of enlightenment out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shortcut to understanding the basis of what we imagine ourselves to be . It did n't take me very long to change my mind . <p> At the same time , I was a practicing Episcopalian . This was the church in which my mother reared me , and I still remember vividly , with a kind of cold , horrified thrill of recognition , the mildness of it all  --  the gray stone of St. Paul 's Episcopal , built as an unquestioning American monument more to England than to the holy trinity ; the priest and the acolytes and the choir in their Catholophilic robes ; the quick , well-wrought , and eminently reasonable sermons ; the pipe organ droning out at decorous volume that simpleminded , straightforward music . Even when I was very young , even when I still loved the Church , that music seemed silly and vapid to me compared with what I heard when I spent time with my father , who always had music playing on his gigantic then-so-called state-of-the-art hi-fi , or  --  best of all  --  when he was practicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his practice room when I was six or seven or eight , reading while he rehearsed , feeling the punch of his bass in the flesh of my arms and legs , in the pit of my belly , and when things were just right , even in my throat  --  as if the vocal cords picked up sympathetic vibrations , as if a voice not my own wanted to have its say in me . Oh , I loved my big daddy God sure enough , but I had another father , too , and the little man who played the bass  --  I say this with all due respect to those well-meaning gentle church folks with whom my mother spent long dull afternoons  --  was the cool one of that brotherhood . <p> Stefan Erikson had , as a visible life-vocation , the ownership and primo chefhood of a chichi little Manhattan restaurant , Chez Police : dinner only , one five-course meal for all comers , a hundred bucks a plate plus vino and beaucoup tips , reservations two months in advance . Like everybody I knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The night after the night after the boring party  --  after Stefan and I had stayed awake many hours letting our bodies carry on a long and complicated conversation  --  I went down to Chez Police as a special guest of the owner . Dressed , as my mother 's Junior League friends would say , to the nines , I waited briefly in the foyer , where I whispered Stefan 's name to the skeptical gangster who passed for a maitre d ' ; while he disappeared into the demimonde to check me out , I looked for the first time at Stefan 's joke entryway decor : a collection of 8x10 photographs of law-enforcement officers , all of them signed  --  quasi-anonymous members of New York 's finest in full uniform mixed with the cast of Hill Street Blues , Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry , Peter Falk as Columbo , Jack Nicholson with the Hollywood scar on his nose from Chinatown , and  --  over the door that led into the dining room  --  the piece de resistance : Sting holding onto his upright bass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the restaurant together , much against his will , he looked up at the picture of Sting and shook Iris head . " That 's what this place is all about , " he said . " White boys who pretend to play bass . " He turned on his heel and walked out ; he never went back . Oh , he was an incredible asshole , sometimes , my sweet daddy  --  as only a disciplined purist can be . <p> That first night , the maitre d ' returned from the bowels of the establishment transformed ; he called me Ms. Brightman , he offered me his arm , he led me through the dining room  --  which contained not a whit of jokey atmosphere ; it was clean and spare , elegantly utilitarian  --  and into the kitchen , where I saw Stefan and Iris staff attacking a dozen sheep-halves with meat cleavers . It was like the aftermath of a ghoulish war , like an outtake from Frankenstein . Stefan could have been the crazy-like-a-fox doctor himself , trying to assemble a single fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic accident . The air was full of the smell of blood , like a slaughterhouse . It made me sick , it made me feel faint , it excited me . Stefan looked up when I came in and waggled his blade . " Welcome to the killing floor , " he said , and then he turned back to the job at hand . <p> Stefan kept beautiful blow in his apartment that overlooked the river . That 's how he got me to go home with him the first time  --  though , think what you will , it would n't have taken much to get me to go almost anywhere from that stuffed-shirt canape orgy I 'd dropped in on without knowing why . Those years I was in a funny frame of mind , bored and curious all at once : bored wherever I was , but somehow suspecting that out there somewhere , not too far away , there were big and important things waiting to be found out . I realize now that this too is part of a religious way of seeing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stashed was supremo supremo , Colombian crime de la crime . I had never been what you could call a coke-head  --  who could afford it , I thought , who was n't a stockbroker or some other species of thief ?  --  but I 'd had a noseful here and there . The stuff Stefan had was Rolls-Royce class to me , like nothing I 'd ever done . Stefan knew it , of course , and was proud of what he had , in that cliched yuppie way . <p> " Here you go , Ms. Brightman , " he said as he passed me the mirror and the dollar bill . " Top of the line , nothing but the best , and all like that . " <p> " Bull , " I said . " If it was that good , I would n't have to snort it through no one-dollar bill . " <p> But when I breathed it in , I knew he was right . Oh , baby , it was beautiful and pure , cold like an air conditioner switched on deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation , with my first breath of that stuff , why they call it snow : not so much because of the way it looks inside a zip-lock baggie as because of what it does to the dark inside your head . Close your eyes , inspire , and it 's like a night in Vermont , twenty below with fresh powder drifted on the ground ; the wind picks up a handful of crystals , and right in front of your face they reflect sudden sharp starlight , tiny but vivid with pain , pure frozen illumination , photons from places so far away nobody can imagine them as places . That 's what it gives the blackness inside the brain : snow in the lungs , snow in the mind , snow in the constellations . <p> " How you doing , sweetheart ? " Stefan asked after a while . <p> " I 'm here and I 'm gone , " I remember answering . " I 'm like the dude who got froze in the iceberg : I 'm clear and I 'm still , forever  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider many things mysterious , some obvious and some not : for example , certain immutable aberrations in the course of every personal history , such as whatever accident it was that brought my mother and father together long enough to get me into the world . It 's hard for me to imagine the two of them attracted to each other even for a moment  --  not because they hated each other later , but because they seemed always to agree to hold each other in an indifference so dense it amounted to obliviousness . Even when I 'd ask one of them about the other , I 'd get nothing , usually  --  not even a flicker of anger , not even the most unconscious manifestation of old pain or lust . When I was old enough to know I ought to know , it seemed very weird to me , like they existed in separate twilight-zone dimensions . <p> I used to talk to Armelia about this sometimes , which I thought was good for me to do since Armelia is the sort for whom there are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " you know what got your mama and daddy together , and you know what got them apart  --  same old thing it always is . Only reason it looks any different is because your people are just too stuck up to admit it . " <p> What I will admit is that the life I lived with my mother  --  all of what I can remember of the first seventeen years of it , with a certain amount of time off to visit my old man at his apartment in the city  --  seems to me now like somebody else 's life , like something out of a distant period in history , before the flood . It seems so far removed from me that I 'm not even sure whether I think of it as a Golden Age  --  or maybe it 's fairer to say that it makes no difference whether I think of it that way or not ; certainly I ca n't feel it that way . I ca n't feel much of anything about those years and who I was then . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel ? I know it ca n't be so . And yet I also know that there are lives , whole ways of life , every aspect and every article of which are designed precisely against feeling  --  lives in which there are so many lies that to admit a single truth , a single disturbance of the surface , would be nothing less than self-annihilation . <p> And I 'm not talking about anything as simple as personal lies . My mother , by her own lights , was no liar ; she lived a good life , according to the ways such things are judged in the here and now , and gave a good life to me . There are lies worse than personal lies  --  larger , deeper , more difficult to comprehend . Let 's begin by saying that I lived in that safe little college town in the Midwest beautifully disguised to myself as a white girl , and it was years , a whole lifetime , before I learned the difference . <p> It was not , you see , that I could actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white girl ; nobody with reasonable eyes in his head could ever mistake me for one . It was that nobody in that little mid-western town , that little upper-middle-class enclave just beyond the margin of a suburb of Chicago , would ever be ungenteel enough to mention the fact that I was not a white girl . And since I lived in that place from before the moment I came to have a memory , it took me a long time to become ungenteel enough to mention the obvious to myself . <p> This is where things really begin to knot up in my mind . I have to admit , there is genteel and there is genteel ; my old man is just as genteel as my old lady ever was on the most Junior-League day of her life . I had started to say that nobody in that midwestern town where I grew up was ever uncool enough to mention obvious facts about my physiognomy , but in their lexicon cool and genteel were not synonyms ; for my father , those two things were one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the real truth of it , it was mutual , and mutually exotic , forms of gentility that drew my folks together in the first place . <p> I can imagine my mother in a postwar cocktail dress at an after-hours Greenwich Village bar . She 's been to some uptown party , but her date has brought her late-night slumming on a dare  --  he 's a proto-Kerouac type of dude , a narrow survivor of the Battle of the Bulge with scars to show for it , upwardly mobile but with a certain je ne sais quoi , an allegiance to the death drive , maybe , or hidden lowlife affiliations . So she goes with him expecting the titillation of disgust , but instead here 's this very precise little orchestra playing music as shimmering and incisive as Scarlatti sonatas . Oh , she is charmed ! I know this side of her perfectly , the exquisite quality of the things my mother as a young woman finds charming . It is very like certain romantic movies of the 1940s . She sits at the tiny table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her elaborate coiffure a little the worse for wear , her orchid wilting , and she is rapturously charmed by the whole scene . <p> And by God good for her , I say  --  it does her credit . That is : if I could change the past , if I could change my mother 's essence , I would have her feel something different  --  because the scene was real , do you hear what I 'm saying , and because the goddamned music was brilliant , no mistake about it , and she should be changed utterly , apotheosized , blown away by those sounds  --  but at least she can dig that there is something happening , something she ought to like , something she ought at least to be charmed by . My old lady is no dope , no matter how I make her sound ; from the point of view of cool , she comes from a culturally disadvantaged place , but she knows quality when it slaps her upside the head . And so she sits there listening , watching , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrific time ; and sooner or later there is oblique eye contact between the blond white girl at the table and the handsome black man onstage with the genius bass : eye contact and instantaneous recognition , because they are opposite numbers , these two , they are moral equivalents communing across socioeconomic boundaries : baby , they are complementary colors . <p> There sooner or later came the I suppose inevitable day when Stefan said to me , " Sweetheart , you are fine and you are smart but you are an insufferable , ineffable fucking snob . " <p> " What you mean ineffable , " I said . We were lying naked on the waterbed in the apartment that overlooked the river . It was late morning . The sun came strong through big bay windows , and the cocaine was half gone . Stefan was gold and ivory in all that illumination  --  I never saw a man with such golden hair , everywhere , and I had just said so . <p> " You think I 'm joking , do n't you , " Stefan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right now . But one of these days I 'll say that to you and mean it , because it 's true . And when I get to that point , I 'll probably have to break your face . " <p> I laughed at him , but I felt a little chill , because I knew he was being straight . " This what I get for being nice to you , " I said , reaching down and squeezing his balls , just hard enough , " gold-crotch man ? " <p> " You and that jive you try to talk , " Stefan said . " You 're totally full of shit . " <p> " And you love it . " <p> " I love it now , " he said . <p> It was later that day we decided to get married . <p> The old Gnostics had their strange myth of origin , tim story of the aboriginal human soul , a fragmentary spark of being , suddenly thrown into the dark abyss of material existence , the henoma . The eye of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether , humanity is a multitude of sparks imprisoned in the dark Physis  --  matter , that is , the physical , the body  --  and we live to put ourselves back together into the primordial beam of illumination . I learned these things at the university , from my first golden lover , who was even more beautiful than Stefan , and who was not a man . <p> Clare was a graduate student , older than I was and much farther gone in the study of the Nag Hammadi manuscripts  --  she was advanced enough in Coptic actually to be able to help our professors in the translating of the texts . She was also a true believer , in her way , a convert of those old bits of papyrus and leather . She not only wanted gnosis , she believed that she had it  --  or that it had her . <p> " Look , " Clare would say to me , showing me her translation-in-progress , which she kept in a spiral-bound notebook everywhere she went , even in bed . " We 're working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about the horror of Nature , who turned her dark vagina and cast from her the power of fire , which was in her from the beginning , through the practice of darkness . " <p> I lay on the bed beside her , staring . I tell you , I could not help it . Clare was , I thought , the most beautiful human being I had ever be.held , or would ever . Looking back on it now  --  and I wonder how true what I seem to remember is , since I have no photographs of her to correct memory 's drift toward the symbolic falsehood  --  I believe she looked uncannily like my mother . <p> Clare was reading from her notebook . It was a late Manhattan night , deep winter ; we had walked a long way that evening in a miraculous snowfall . Oh , I was transported , sistren and brethren . What was I , nineteen ? And I had a splendid love , and I had a splendid city , and I had a splendid life : so what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white socialite for a mother and a genius jazzman for a blackface father ? <p> Thus , my love was reading , the earth arose from her confusion , water from . her terror ; air from the consolidation of her grief ; while fire was inherent in all these elements , as ignorance lay concealed in these three sufferings . <p> " It 's beautiful , is n't it , what those old men wrote ? " I said , not really thinking about what she was reading or what I was saying . I had my hand on her belly , I had my head in the hollow of her arm , I was breathing the air she had breathed out in her reading , I was thinking of her taste . I had never been fully in love with a woman before-I had never loved a woman the way a man might love a woman , and I never would again , though I would go to bed with a few later on before the final thing with Armelia , mostly for old times ' sake . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not conceal it  --  a marvelous , ferocious , irrational , even monomaniacal lust . It was a combination I had never known was possible . <p> " Not what they wrote , " Clare said . " What they wrote hardly matters at all . What is beautiful about them is what they were  --  and that they knew what they were . " <p> I was touching her shoulder with the tips of my fingers ; I was touching the side of her breast with my breath and with my lips , gently ; I was taking the undisguised smell of her body into myself , lungful by slow lungful . I was , all in all , not listening to what she was saying , but I wanted to hear her talk . I was stroking her nipple with the palm of my hand , then with my fingers ; I was saying , " What were they ? What did they know they were ? " <p> Clare caught my hand as it moved across her and held it to her lips . Then she whispered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , love . They were you and me . " <p> Stefan and I were married on a day in the fall of some year in the 1980s . If I think about it , I 'll remember exactly when , date-wise ; but I have the clearest memory of the day itself . It 's not the getting married I remember so much  --  we went unceremoniously , so to speak , to an office in a high building , a registry  --  as the walk we took getting there . <p> I read somewhere that there is a particular breed of marine fish whose mating is triggered by a certain incidence of light : let the sun hit the water from just the ordained angle , and those little mothers go to it . Nobody has to say nothing , they just all know , and they get it on . I think I thought it was that way with Stefan and me . We had n't really said much about getting married ; I , at least , had n't given the business any thought at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village Gate where a yellowing poster spoke my daddy 's name ( in small type , under the headliners , typical bassman 's billing ) , it all seemed programmed . It was a cool afternoon , the leaves were yellow and spinning through the air around us . I felt like the proverbial fly in amber : hung there , eternal in my own temporary , mortal way . <p> We had a little party that night , just a few friends and a dealer or two , a joke of a party , really : the spirit of the marriage , up to then , was the spirit of a joke . We did n't call my father . I thought about him , though , all through the wine and the hors d'oeuvres we ordered from the dell down the street ; I thought about him when the snow came out and everybody did a line , and a line , and a line . I thought about my father 's name on that poster : with Golden Brightman and Connie Kay . He loved to play when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my father loved smart . That 's why he loved me so much , he used to tell me , and I knew it was true . My father was not the kind of man to love you just because you happened to be his own flesh and blood . I mean , if you were , he 'd put up with you , and send his support check right along . But I 'm talking love , baby , I mean the realest of all real things . I was thinking this way along about the third line of blow , and all of a sudden I was gone , man , I was on the floor , crying hard like Hollywood black women do in sappy Mummy movies when their man has died or left them , like they cry when their child is in the ground . The doors of my body opened , and I was wailing . And Stefan was there on one side of me doing his slick best , and sweet Armelia was there on the other , and they said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that way ? But I could not tell them that I had pierced the veil , and I was on one side and my beautiful cool father was on the other , and I would never in this living world be with him , I mean really with him , ever again . <p> Later that night , with me on top of him , Stefan whispered , " Lady , you take this marriage shit more serious than I thought you would . " I do n't know if he meant the way I fucked him or the way I had cried . <p> " Well , do n't you be getting the big head except where it counts , " I whispered back , and I rocked , and when he came he screamed . <p> Yellow snow was a saying that came from my mother , though it did not of course originate with her or with that ersatz town in Illinois where she brought me up . It came to her through her family , from at least three generations back  --  something her great-grandfather from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her father 's side were deep country people , rednecks par excellence , crackers to the nth , natives of Lewis-burg , where when the Civil War rolled through , nobody was sure which side was which . She never would admit it to me , but her paternal great-granddaddy was a Copperhead , a lay preacher coal miner with black lung who seriously believed that niggers were cursed of God ; if that were n't enough , her maternal great-great was a slaver captain . I know this because my daddy knew it , and he told me the story one summer when we were driving from New York to Miami , where he was due to play a gig at a big hotel . The deal was , I could stay free in a posh suite with a free hotel nanny while he worked the main room downstairs in a quartet fronted by Zoot Sims . I was thirteen that summer , my daddy was forty , the divorce was four years old , and the hotel nanny was eighteen  --  a New Orleans octoroon named Collice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She fell in love with me and taught me how to French-kiss while she rubbed my back in the black sunken vastness of the hotel bathtub . That was all we ever did except talk , Collice being a good Catholic and me just a kid , but that summer she told me a thing or two . <p> It was my first trip South , which both Collice and my daddy understood , and they both talked to me a lot during that time . It was 1963 , and things were hot and humid south of the Mason-Dixon . I 'd sailed cross-country from Chicago to New York in a TWA jet about a week before we drove down . In my mother 's beautiful enclave , the Civil Rights Movement was all the rage  --  all the good folks in her circle were liberal right up to their wallets , and they sent tons of money to Martin Luther King  --  but I knew almost nothing of what was really at stake . In the abstract , I understood that Miami was an enemy capital . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a princess as long as we stayed behind closed doors , I did n't have a clue . <p> " Where 'd you get that pretty skin ? " Collice said to me as she rubbed my back in the tub . She 'd undressed me almost as soon as she saw me , and it had taken me less than a minute to get over thinking there was anything strange about it . <p> " I do n't know , " I said , not knowing what to say and knowing it made no difference what I said . I was leaning forward so she could rub soap on me with her strong subtle hands , and I was busy feeling what she meant for me to feel . <p> " Look here , " said Collice , and she pulled me back so I lay against the sloped back of the tub ; then she put her hand on my sternum . " You a fine light brown , " she said , " but I 'm lighter than you . " <p> I looked down and saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in our shades , but there was a striking difference in hue . I was brown , she was yellow . The result was that she looked whiter than I did . <p> " A high-yellah woman is what they call me in New Orleans , " Collice said , " but around here they do n't call me nothing much but you . " <p> She touched my right breast . " See how much browner you are than me ? " she said . I leaned my head back to look at her upside down behind me and discovered that she 'd taken off her blouse while my back was turned . Her breasts were small and very prominent and as light as my mother 's , but with a golden cast I 'd never seen before . The word areola came to me then  --  I 'd read it in some soft-porn romance novel  --  and for the first time it truly meant something . <p> On the road a couple of days before , on the new highway that bypassed Lewisburg , West Virginia , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apropos of yellow snow . . .

" Not a house in sight . " <p> " Not a house nor a home , " he answered . " Nevertheless . " And he told me what my mother had told him about the aristocratic hillbillies who were the bearers of my maternal family 's Scottish genes , how one of them , John Davidson Greene he was called , had been the captain of a slave ship working out of Baltimore . " He kept his wife and family up here in the mountains , " Daddy said , " and he 'd take off for a year at a time to round up wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , built a big house in Lewisburg . He worked his way up from stone zero , child . He was a smart old bugger , or lucky , to live up here , where the money he socked away did n't melt in the Civil War , way it would have if he 'd put his roots down in Virginia . He was partial to border states . Old JDG finally died on shipboard of something called African Fever , but his widow was a rich widow and stayed rich . She bought a few coal mines . " <p> We drove along for a minute without speaking . I was half thinking about what he said , and half worrying about whether Little Suzie was about to wake up or not : there was an urgency in what the Everly Brothers were singing that deeply divided my mind . <p> When the song ' ended , my father switched off the radio . " What do you think about that ? " he said . " Did your mother ever tell you anything about Lewisburg and John Davidson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Well , it 's no wonder , I guess , and no big deal . Likely she 'll bring it up sooner or later . But you get the point , do n't you ? All that money her daddy left her , and on which you all live so high , got started with old John Greene rounding up niggers in the African outback and selling them to high-rolling plantation crackers  --  just as sure as the Kennedy tribal fortune and national nest egg came from bootlegging . " <p> Some unconscious part of me knew I had just been made privy to a deep piece of personal and historical hideousness ; another knew I had just filed away an important piece of ammunition to use against my mother in future arguments . But I said nothing , and as far as I can remember I thought nothing . What was there for me to think ? There were black and white in me ; there were slaves and the masters of slaves . My psyche 's class war was well in the future , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy shots . <p> " Never eat the . yellow snow , " my father said . <p> " Right , " I said automatically , since the phrase was something my mother often said ; but then I asked " What ? " as soon as I realized that it made no sense for him to say that thing at that moment . <p> " Your mama says that , does n't she ? " <p> " Yes . She says it all the time . " <p> " And what does she mean when she says it ? " <p> I knew and I did n't know . What was the occult West Virginia meaning of pissed-on snow ? It was something beneath your dignity , something laughably impure . <p> Between lessons in basic French as I leaned back in the tub , Collice told me a few stories about old New Orleans , her beautiful quadroon mother , the white father she never knew-how she grew up in what sounded like an ancient and splendid hotel for women like her mother , how she was reared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It all sounded impossible to me , exotic like something from a book of genteel fairy tales . <p> " You 're lucky , " I said as she rubbed my legs and back dry with an enormous Turkish towel . <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " To grow up like that . " <p> She laughed and threw the towel over my head . " Girl , " she said , " you blind as a bat . You do n't know nothing . " <p> From where I am now , remembering all this , time seems to work in reverse , or maybe in no particular order at all . I can think of Clare , then of Collice , then of my father in the car , driving south . It works like a sudden ray of sunlight through a tear in the clouds ; it works like a gust of snowy wind in the face , like rainfall , like coke up your nose , like a pure shower of gold in your lap : nothing has to add up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd go down to Chez Police to eat just about every evening . It was one of the perqs of being married to the man , and an almost unthinkable luxury : hundred-dollar dinners every night that rolled around . And the food , friends , was genuine art . Make no mistake about it : Stefan Erikson was brilliant in the kitchen at Chez Police . After the first few times , I got used to being in the dense carnivorous atmosphere of that kitchen . I had a special table over by the pastry chef 's counter , and I 'd watch her work while I ate . She was a pale girl from Eastern Europe  --  Bulgaria , I think  --  who looked consumptive , a sort of culinary female Keats . She was known as the best in her field west of Paris . It was magic to watch her , magic to watch them all . Except for the more or less unavoidable sounds of cooking , the alchemical fulminations of pots and pans simmering and boiling and sauteing , it was mostly silent in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody worked with serious intensity , with ferocious passionate concentration . They were , you might say , consummate athletes of cuisine , ballerinas of the kitchen , ascetics of eating out  --  chaste as eunuchs in a harem . They did what they did with perfect economy of motion , gracefully , and at incredible speed . I would sit for hours in a kind of ecstatic coma , eating whatever they brought me and watching whatever they did . They worked from no written recipes , putting together without verbal consultation the most byzantine dishes you can imagine , the sort of things that , committed to the page , would rival the catalogs of Whitman , any of the bizarre miracles of the Torah : take the flesh of a dozen kine , dust with transmuted gold and the residue of a bushel of star anise , sublimate in a mercury bath for three-quarters of a lifetime , sprinkle with Velveeta , stir  --  serves nine . <p> Sometimes , if it seemed too decadently lonely to eat at Chez Police at that special table all by myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his work was too one-track  --  I 'd bring Armelia : Armelia , my soulmate , Armelia my succubus , Armelia my sweet familiar . How long had I known Armelia by then ? I ca n't remember for certain : years . Beautiful Armelia , who was not smart , but was savvy and quick  --  which is not the same thing  --  and truly a black girl , who never let me forget how white I was . And with Armelia those days and nights I was a white girl . When Armelia was with me , I was my mother , and Armelia knew it . Armelia could get her teeth into my mother in me , and when she did she was like a bulldog ; she shut her eyes and chewed the meat of my psyche and refused to let go until it thundered . She dug it that I took her to Chez Police , and her digging went down through multiple strata . First , she loved the place , loved the food . Armelia was what you call a first-dimensional sensualist  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her was what sex is to most of us , and to her sex was a fabulous , potent , imperious drug : she saw visions when she came . <p> Armelia worked for American Express . She started out as the one who called your house when your bill was overdue ; and she was good at weaseling the overdue out of whomever she called . She dropped out of high school in the tenth grade , but the folks at AmEx ai n't no dummies  --  they made her a supervisor after she 'd been with them six months . She made good money , and she spent it on things that felt good . So eating free at Chez Police was heaven on earth to her . Then , she dug watching me watch her eat at Chez Police . She knew she enjoyed the food a billion times more than I did ; she knew I watched her pleasure with pleasure of my own , a kind of voyeuristic awe ; my pleasure in her pleasure gave her pleasure . It was literal biofeedback , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Stefan cooked the food we ate and that she understood it better than I did : that put her one up on me , something between her and my hubby . And finally , she liked to see how white I turned when I walked in the door of Chez Police . <p> She was right . It was true . Every meal I ate in that place was a complex spiritual event , Byzantium going on and off in my soul . <p> I could n't help it . What I got into at Chez Police was appearances . I loved the wood and chrome of the counters , I loved the stainless steel of the knives and cleavers , I loved to see the pastries come together , and the vegetables  --  and after a while even the animals who died for our sins  --  come apart . I loved to watch the artistry of the chefs  --  Stefan no more than the others , because in the kitchen at Chez Police he was one of many , e pluribus unum  --  and yes I thought of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help it . Armelia figured that one out right away , and it made her laugh like hell  --  she could see I was thinking with my white mama 's mind . <p> The minute I entered the aura of Chez Police , I lost every vestige of cool and replaced it with pure white taste . I became mannerly , I became admiring , I took on the servility of white folks toward their servants . I despised them , I wanted them , I needed them , I groveled before them , all according to the rules of etiquette . I hated myself , but I could n't stay away . I was degraded like an addict ; I gained fifteen pounds in six months . It was incurable , and I did n't care . <p> Neither did Armelia . Her addiction was worse than mine because it was sheerly primary : she got off on the food . She even envied me the flesh I put on . " Looks good on you , " she said . " You always too skinny anyway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuisine . " If I could eat at that place free anytime I felt like it , " she said , " I 'd be big as a 1961 Cadillac now , and headed for Mack truck , girl . You better believe it . " So I took her down to Chez Police once every couple of weeks  --  for one thing , just to keep her in a generous frame of mind . <p> But I had other motives also , darker ones , unconscious ones . I was giving in to the Old Eve of the shadow side of the psyche . When I went down to Chez Police , I could n't trust myself to see what I was seeing . Something about the aura of that place turned me back into the white girl I thought I stopped being when I was twelve . That white girl was me , and I hated her the way you hate a cruel stepsister : with pure meanness , incalculable jealousy , and a brutal , violent distrust . That white girl distracted my mind when I went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ; something in me wanted other eyes and ears in that place . That 's why I wanted Armelia there . Something in me recognized something in Chez Police but could not say its name . It took Armelia to do that , and for her it was perfectly easy . <p> About Clare , I remember other things entirely . I remember the room she worked in , nothing more than an oversized closet in her over-priced New York apartment , cunningly converted into a study . I use that word cunningly with a certain aversion , but no other word will do , really : what Clare had wrought in that closet was a blending of knowledge , craft , and slyness . The space was a small walk-in  --  already a rarity in an apartment as tiny as hers . She had gutted it of shelving and clothes-rods . With her own hands she made herself a cypress workspace , tier on tier of small drawers , little file boxes , shelves  --  a small amphitheater , you might say , or an office made on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grades in it , and at the center her beautiful compact writing desk . It was fashioned , she said  --  that was her word , fashioned  --  on the model of the memory theater of Giulio Camillo , the sixteenth-century Italian alchemist and egghead . " Though , " she said , " who knows how accurate a replica it is , since there are no extant detailed descriptions of Camillo 's creation . " <p> I did n't really listen when she told me about Camillo . I was young  --  nineteen , twenty ?  --  and I was in love with this splendid woman . Every second I was with her , I watched her ; every second I wanted my hands on her . How could I listen , with all that going on ? The first time she took me into that study , it was full of candlelight , a special effect just for me : two dozen tapers burned gold in that small space . She sat in the chair at her desk , and they surrounded her like a constellation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Clare said . " He thought he could know everything if he could come to see everything  --  and he built his theater for that purpose . All the little drawers and shelves contained aids to the visual memory , the visual imagination  --  scraps of text , knickknacks , seashells , crows ' feathers , Turks ' teeth , miniature allegorical paintings , eye of newt , God knows what all  --  and to bring back anything to the mind 's eye , to create the visual image of anything whatever in the mind , one only had to look at , or encounter , a certain set of these things in a certain order . The science is to . know the objects and the order . To remember your mother 's face , see the contents of drawer four , drawer sixty-eight , drawer nine , and drawer nine hundred and eighty , in that sequence . To recall the face of God , refer to drawers forty-three , eight hundred and one , seventy-seven , three , and six-sixty-six . " <p> I remember she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember how her long hair shone in the candlelight . Maybe Camillo was right at that : love is a lot of cliches , memory a junkyard of icons . Maybe the dead hand of the history of the heart lies heavy on us all . I ca n't tell you , I ca n't even begin to remember , how much I loved that woman , how much I wanted to be her . Can you really remember love ? Is n't it like trying to remember pain ? But what I said was , " Sounds like nothing but a high-class five-and-dime store . " <p> And that was wonderful , that was just the right thing to say , because she laughed . What she loved me for , I think , was the bitterness I was full of ; she liked to see it slip out , even when it was aimed , however accidentally , right at her . <p> " That 's exactly what it was , " she said . " All built according to a system , you understand  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the hermetic philosophers . And that 's precisely nothing but history 's high-class five-and-dime , pathetic as an old woman 's jewelry box . What Camillo wanted was a computer , so he made one out of furniture , and that was the best he could do . " <p> " And what do you want ? " That , for me , was always the question with Clare . If I could have answered that question , I would have known all I ever needed to know . If I could have answered that , I think what happened later would n't have broken me down like it did . <p> " What I want , " Clare said , " is a place to sit and wait . And so I built this little room , just to pass the time . " <p> " You built this all yourself ? " <p> " Your father is a musician , " she answered . " Mine was a cabinetmaker . I have his tools , and his hands . " She held up her hands in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blunt-fingered , capable . " I 'm good with wood . It 's something out of the body 's recollection , the memory theater of the DNA . " <p> " And what do you keep in all these little drawers ? " I looked at them straight on for the first time . There must have been two hundred of them , arranged in a curved bank like instruments in a fighter-jet cockpit , stops in the control panel of a Rube Goldberg cathedral organ . They were of many different sizes ; the whole arrangement was idiosyncratic , but patterned somehow , pleasing . <p> " Open one up and see . " <p> " Which one ? " <p> She gave me a straight-faced look . " The choice is yours , " she said . " And the one you choose will make all the difference . " <p> Suddenly this seemed serious . I looked at all the little drawers . Each had an identical fluted ivory knob . There was more than met the eye at stake here , and I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , suspicious . " What the hell is this , Clare ? " <p> " Do n't you know your Shakespeare , love ? " she said . " Don't.ask questions . Choose . Reply , reply . " <p> I reached up ; I hesitated ; I opened a drawer . It was right in the middle of the console , just at the level of my eyes , the first one my hand came to . It opened smoothly , without sound ; the joinery was that perfect . I leaned forward . <p> " It 's empty , " I said . " Impossible . Reach inside . " <p> I felt stiff , slick paper . I pulled out a photograph . When I held it up in the candlelight , I saw it was a snapshot of me . <p> " Shit , " I said . " Where 'd you get this ? " <p> " It 's a miracle , " Clare said . <p> Suddenly I was angry . " This is bullshit , " I said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years old , one my father had taken of me when we were on the road . Clare had stolen it from my apartment . " You ripped this off . " <p> " You found the right drawer , " she said . " Fate . How else could you have known ? " <p> " Fate my ass , " I said . " I 'll show you fate . " I opened another drawer . Inside there was another copy of the same snapshot . <p> Clare clutched at her heart . " A double miracle ! " she cried in the voice of a melodrama heroine . " I faint ! I swoon away ! " <p> I opened another drawer , another , another . I opened them all . There must have been two hundred copies of that snapshot of me , a girl of seventeen , standing at the base of a California redwood , wearing short-shorts , grinning at my daddy like a fool in love . Not a single drawer contained anything else . <p> Clare touched my breast . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory is . You see what I want . " <p> There 's only one way to say the truth : a year or so later , when that woman killed herself , the universe broke down . <p> My mother never really knew about my father and me , how we were when we were together without her . I never told her about the hotel in Miami , or about Collice , or what my father said about her family . She never told me , straight out , the story of John Davidson Greene and his Baltimore slave ship , though she let me read family documents that unmasked that whole hunk of history . A lot of what we knew about each other was oblique . And it took Armelia to let me know a thing or two about Stefan . <p> One night in April , after Stefan and I had been married about six months , Armelia and I were sitting at our table in the kitchen of Chez Police . We had been eating for hours , and drinking red wine . We put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We ate like fools . I remember they brought us the first batch of a recipe Stefan had resurrected from the Romans  --  he was a droll scholarly dude , my fork-tongued man  --  made with a special sauce called garum . Stefan stood by the table and read the translation from a book by a man named Apius : <p> " Place in a vessel all the insides of fish , both large fish and small . Salt them well . Expose them to the air until they are completely putrid . In a short time a liquid is produced . Draw this off . This , " my sweetie said , " is garum . " <p> " Putrid fish juice ? " Armelia squealed . <p> " Exactamundo , my love , " Stefan said . " In precise proportion , of course . Then , says Apius , this : Put the following ingredients into a n'tor-tar : anise-seed , dried mint , and lazar root which is a kind of asafoetida ; cover them all with vinegar . Add dates and pour in garum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a proper thickness with red wine warmed , and then pour this same over your chicken . " <p> " Lord , " Armelia moaned . Our chicken garum was three-quarters gone . There was a roaring in my ears , a growling like the echo of the empty stomachs of all the bulimics of antiquity combined . I felt woozy ; I thought of John Davidson Greene dying of African fever ; I thought of a typhoon on the high seas . <p> " Standard dinner for a Roman academician , " Stefan said . " Making this stuff takes days  --  it 's like an alchemist 's procedure . " He was wearing his white chef 's uniform ; he looked like a Platonic surgeon . <p> " Standard dinner for a buzzard , " Armelia said . " Got any more ? " <p> Then , hours later  --  drunk on cabernet and rotten-fish juice , giggly as schoolgirls  --  we saw four big faceless dudes in white suits talking to Stefan over by the walk-in refrigerator door . <p> " Who 's that ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or a reggae barbershop quartet , " Armelia answered , and then she looked at me . " Do n't you know ? " <p> I squinted at the four men . It was as if they were there and not there , ghosts , holograms . " Whatever I 'm seeing , " I said , " I ai n't ever laid eyes on before . " <p> " Just you watch , " Armelia said , and about that time one of the waiter-apparitions handed Stefan two black alligator suitcases , and they all vanished into the refrigeration room . <p> " What the hell 's going on ? " I said . " Stefan do n't need new luggage . " <p> " Come on , girl . " Armelia reached over and stroked my cheek . " They selling Stefan his stuff . " <p> " What stuff ? You mean like what voodoo dust he needs to putrefy sardines and make that magic sauce ? " <p> " I mean what he sells to buy you every little thing your heart desires . Those brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture snapped into focus in the middle of my hazy brain . <p> I remember it was dark in the room . I remember the voices . <p>  --  What 's happening ? the woman 's voice said . <p>  --  It 's us , baby , the man 's voice said . We 're here with you . <p> It was my mother and father , together in the same room for the first time in years . <p>  --  Where 's Clare ? I said into the darkness . What are we doing here ? <p>  --  You 'll be all right , one of them said . The doctors say you 'll be fine . You just need a little help . <p>  --  What were you doing ? said the other voice . What were you trying to do ? <p>  --  Do n't worry her now . That was my father : I knew it . She does n't need your grief . <p>  --  Then what does she need , I want to know . <p>  --  Clare , I said , and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I swallowed two bottles of pills and lay down on the bed with the window open , hearing the traffic ten floors down grind itself into golden powder : That the earth arose from her confusion , water from her terror , air from the consolidation of her grief ; while life was inherent in all these elements as ignorance lay concealed in these three sufferings . Those are not my words  --  Valentinius the Gnostic wrote that . I copied it from Clare 's journal , the last thing she wrote there , a fragment of a translation from the texts she was working on . I wanted to know what this journal meant . It was not a personal journal , not a diary in any usual sense ; it consisted of nothing but fragments from the Gnostic Gospels . But I could not rid myself of the idea that the fragments made a sort of code . There was no reason for her to record the fragments there ; her translations were carried on and recorded in meticulous notebooks elsewhere . <p> Just before the Valentinius quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> In his madness God said , " I am God , and there is no other God beside me , " for he is ignorant of the place from which he had come . And when he saw the creation which surrounds him and the multitudes of angels around him which had come forth from him , he said to them , " I am a jealous God , and there is no other God beside me . " But by announcing this he indicated to the angels that another God does exist ; for if there were no other one , of whom would he be jealous ? <p> And what is this life , I wanted to know , what is this world , what are any of us but secret images of Clare , cruel illusions projected against the darkness ? She was struggling to understand not only herself but all of us . Maybe what she came to in the end was the impossibility of what she wanted ; or maybe she broke through , maybe she understood it all , and saw there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flesh for even one more day . Either way , what she wanted was what I wanted , even though I had no idea what it was . <p>  --  She 'll be all right , my mother 's voice said in the hospital room  --  high and hysterical and dramatic , like Charlie Parker on smack . <p>  --  You 're goddamned right she will , my father 's voice said , cool but deep , a perfect contrapuntal basso . She 'll be just fine . <p> It did not bother me to learn that Stefan was selling astral-quality cocaine under the counter at Chez Police . That did n't make any difference to me at all  --  which is the ironic thing . If he 'd told me about it , I would n't have cared in the least . What bothered me was that I did n't know  --  and that Armelia did . I never suspected a thing , but Armelia was hip all along . <p> And it was such a natural . What a place to sell from  --  where else could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what got to me was that I never knew Stefan was smart  --  not that kind of smart . For all his grace as a high-dollar fry cook , it never entered my mind that he could think such a pretty thought . <p> But Armelia knew . She knew the first time she ever set foot in Chez Police . She knew the first time she laid eyes on Stefan . <p> It was strictly a matter of gnosis . Probably she knew the first time she ever laid eyes on me . <p> I did n't know it right away , but that night was the beginning of a long , dark fall . <p> Repression is the mother of stupidity . Do n't go look that up : I 'm the only one who ever said it . <p> Case in point : my father played with Coltrane once , for a week and a half . Jimmy Garrison was sick , and Coltrane needed a bassman to fill in , so he got my daddy . <p> It 's a funny thing to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of it anyway . But back when Golden Brightman sat in with Trane at the Village Gate , folks were saying the music lacked beauty . Some people thought Coltrane was a ripoff artist , that he made ugly noise and called it genius . These are the same assholes who look at a Rothko and say Abstract art : give my five-year-old brother a bucket of paint and he 'll make you a millionaire . You listen to that music now , it 's like napalm , it 's pure genius , and it sounds  --  main-stream . That 's because it was so hot it burned down all the walls . <p> When we were driving to Miami that summer , Golden kept on humming Coltrane . This was in the days before cassette decks , and there was no jazz on the radio in West Virginia  --  not even in North Carolina , which iS where , by some perverse miracle , Coltrane was born . So Golden would sing tunes for me  --  " Body and Soul , " the Coleman Hawkins version , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or " Take Five "  --  he had a sweet voice when he wanted , and he liked to sing like Paul Desmond 's alto sax . But this one summer it was Coltrane , mostly " Naima , " and he sang it with a worried look on his face , like a man with a deep dull pain . <p> Now , I was only thirteen , but I was Golden Brightman 's daughter , and I knew that tune . I did n't really understand it , but I knew it . So I said , " Daddy , why do you keep singing ' Naima ' ? " And he said , " Sweetheart , that tune 's got its hooks in my mind . " Somehow I did n't want to know any more , so I kept my mouth shut for a couple of hours  --  by then we were outside of Baltimore  --  and he was still humming like a torturee , so I said " Why ' Naima ' ? " And he said , like no time had passed at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Then he told me how , the whole time he 'd been on stage with Coltrane and that band  --  McCoy Tyner on piano , madman Elvin Jones on drums  --  he 'd felt like he was losing his mind . " It was n't that I could n't play with those cats , " he said . " I could . I held my own . But the whole time I felt like I was completely out of control , like I did n't know what was going on . And there was all that  --  all that sound . Everywhere ! " <p> " They played loud ? " <p> " Naw , that ai n't what I mean . They played like there was no yesterday . " <p> " No tomorrow ? " <p> " No yesterday . And do n't you ask me what I mean , because I ca n't tell you . It 's just  --  well , you take that ' Naima . ' It 's absolutely simple . Da deeeee  --  da dee daaaaah . . . man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a love song , really . Trane wrote it about his first wife . But it almost killed me every time we played it . " <p> I did n't say anything . I think I had the glimmering of an intuition that I was about to hear something that would bother me for the rest of my life . <p> " Because , " he said , after fifteen or twenty miles , " I did n't know what it was about . Love , yeah , but no kind of love you or I want to go through , child . There 's something going on in that man 's music that 1 just do n't understand . And it 's not the music that I do n't get  --  it 's something else . But the way it feels is like I do n't know what 's happening  --  it 's like I 'm a beginner , like I just do n't know the ground rules , the idiot fundamentals . Like it 's a mother tongue I do n't speak . " <p> And that was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what he 'd told me  --  though it took me years to know it with the part of my mind that 's mostly where I live when I 'm awake  --  was that he was too small to play that music , too cool . That was it . He was cool , and that music burned him down where he stood . <p> That was not a thing I wanted to know . But he wanted to know it even less than I did . And he never played with Coltrane again . <p> What comes next is the part that 's hard to tell , not so much because of what happened  --  though that 's sure as hell hard enough  --  but because of how my mind was , the weird way I remember it . <p> Was it depression that came over me ? I do n't know . Whatever it was , it came on slow ; but by the time I noticed it , it was so cosmic that it transcended psychological categories . I guess the fact that you 're depressed does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't thinking psychology right then . I was into metaphysics . I was staring through a piece of #20 industrial-tinted glass at the sunset to end all sunsets , the kickoff of a cosmological dark night of the soul . <p> It started the night of what I would later call the Revelation of Chez Police , but I did n't understand right away what was going on . The first symptom was that  --  after Chez Police shut down and Stefan and Armelia and I sat in the kitchen watching the clean-up while we sipped Laphroaig and shot the breeze , then all said goodnight and went home and Stefan and I took off our clothes and got in bed  --  I could n't come enough . That had never happened to me before . It was n't that I could n't come , you see-it was that I could n't , would n't , stop . Stefan was tired , but willing enough , in the beginning ; and , maybe because he did n't have much of an edge , he stayed with me for quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of multiple orgasms that I think scared him a little ; and after he was finished , I was n't . I got him to keep on with his hands , and after he fell asleep  --  passed out , I think  --  I kept on myself . It could n't have gone on as long as it seemed , but it felt like hours . <p> Curiously , it was n't glorious  --  it was horrifying . It was like being taken over by something from another world . It was like being possessed . <p> It was then I started losing pieces of myself . Everything was dust , and it all kept crumbling . <p> Nobody saw any difference in me . Most of the time I did n't see any difference in myself . I did whatever it was I did every day  --  and just what was I doing ? I had no job then , I had no vocation ; really , I had no life  --  just as I had always done it . The sun moved in its blinding , reliable arc over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us down here , the stars moved in the same old way . I did what I did . But I started thinking more and more of Clare , of who she was , of the work she was into . I thought about the incomprehensible surfaces of those reproduced scrolls she kept staring at , studying them not as if she were looking for the answers to questions , but as if she were looking into a mirror . <p> Really , I remember thinking , what so many of the papyri contained was ridiculous bullshit : recipes for potions and love amulets , surefire knock-em-dead evil-eye curses , cures for dandruff and warts and the clap , crap like that . And maybe what all the codices contained was bull-shit-who knows , when the highest and deepest spiritual yearnings of the human soul give incommensurable and illogical expression to themselves , whether to call the result bullshit ? <p> That did n't matter to Clare . She took each text simply for what it was , or for what it was n't , which amounts to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest lover on the planet , who had discovered the simple fact that it does n't matter who you love , that all people are the same person , all love is love . Or as if she had discovered that there is no love ; there is only the dark inside the body . <p> I looked , around this time , for the notes I had taken in the time I knew Clare . I turned the apartment inside out , and found nothing . I had had a dozen notebooks . I had put them away in love and sorrow when she died , the way I put away so many things . Now they had vanished . The first day Stefan woke up , in the late afternoon like always , and found me at it  --  I had ripped everything out of the closets , pulled down all the books , opened all the drawers , thrown everything on the floor  --  he said , " Hey , Brightman , you trying out for a burglar ? " But I was n't talking . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word . After he left the house , I put everything away . Then I ripped it all out again . I could n't find a trace of Clare anywhere . <p> Later I dialed my mother 's number , for the first time in over a year . I never called the woman anymore . I do n't know why I called her then . I heard the telephone ringing in that pricey house in the suburb outside Chicago  --  I could imagine it so clearly , with its white rugs , its steel-and-glass tables , its cool Chagallesque paintings , maybe some soft white jazz on the expensive stereo : Lord , it was the image of middle-class heaven , a sort of Visa Gold Card paradise . Right then I wanted to be there . I wanted the Rapture to come and name me one of the chosen . After a while I hung up the phone . It was a simple , symbolic fact : there was nobody home . <p> Then , on the third day  --  I 'm still speaking symbolically , you understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the end , to the university library . I knew that , even if I could n't find my notes , in the library I could find some residue of Clare . I could have used her name to get into the special collections , I think  --  my guess is that even after all that time , some of the magic would still be there . But that would have been too much . I went to the stacks . I took down a heap of the standard reference works on Gnosticism that Clare had probably used . I took them to a table in the corner . I went through them page by page , until finally one fell open as though charmed  --  which it was , but only by use , by having been turned often to this particular place , a page where a passage had been underlined : <p> Again , sometimes ( it is as ) if people were murdering them , though there is no one even pursuing them , or they themselves are killing their neighbors , for they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a note in her hand . It said simply , The Nightmare Parable . Touching the paper , I could still feel the imprint of her pen . <p> It was enough . I left the book lying open on the table . I walked out into Manhattan  --  it was night , January , snowing a grainy , sleety snow , hardly snow at all . I came to the East Village . There were people on the street , all sorts of people just like always , but not like always , not like anything I had ever seen before . It was a trick of the emotions , I know , some enzyme built up in the medulla oblongata from an excess of grief  --  but it seemed I could see through their faces . It seemed they were wearing masks made of some peculiar transparency , like isinglass . They were walking memento mori . I know the danse macabre when I see it . I know what all that jive means . It was just the carnival of the dying . One woman  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tights and a knit blouse constellated with sequins  --  had a darkness under the skull above her left eye . I could have told her about the tumor . One , a man in a silk stockbroker suit , radiated a sickly green from the region of the liver . The more I looked , the more everyone seemed to have something wrong with them , their auras displaced , shadows over vital organs , shimmering mystical daggers plunged in their flesh and twisted . Look : I understood the pathology . I did n't believe a symbol or an ikon of it . If I thought about it hard , I could have described the precise biochemistry at work , even as it was all going down . I was sick in the brain , people , and I knew it . I was n't about to start with the laying on of hands , even if it might have done some good . I ignored it all . I looked away from the skeletons , the ulcerated astral bodies , the bilious spiritual residues , the tumorous souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed on track , I walked the line . It was snowing  --  I remember it so luminously  --  and the small , cold , repetitious touch of it on my forehead kept me clear . I weaved my way through that mazy outtake from The Night of the Living Dead , and I made it home . <p> It was dark in the apartment except for the single candle burning in the bedroom . It was silent and sane in there , the . material world . What did I expect  --  Romance ? Where does a single candle lead you ? I followed that light . It was gold , as the cliche tells you . It was almost steady . <p> On the bed , there was a brilliant divided body . I 'm telling you what I saw : it was like an egg with a hairline crack , an egg held up to a candle so its translucency is apparent . I knew it at once . It was Plato , The Symposium , the bit about urhumans being ovoid bisexual beasts : split them apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and love begins . <p> Stefan moved in his sleep , and the egg cracked open . Beside him , sweet naked Armelia opened her immaculate eyes . <p> What could I do ? I took off my clothes and lay down with them . Someone snuffed the candle . There were benzene rinsings in the air . <p> It was on my way to the warehouse of the snow . <p> How long did it all go on ? <p> I could n't begin to tell you . From the time my mother met my father to the time Stefan and Armelia took me , there might have been a heartbeat . <p> With what did they restrain you ? <p> They tied me with silk rope , I think it was , segments of mountain climbers ' line . It was soft , and so white I could n't look at it . <p> What did they do to you ? <p> Nothing I did n't know . Nothing I did n't understand . <p> Where did it begin ? <p> In Africa . In Lewisburg , West Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thighs . <p> What did you remember ? <p> Clare . How she stood in front of the bedroom window just before sunrise  --  there was light in the air outside , behind her  --  and stared down at me , thinking I was still asleep . She seemed an enormous dark god-sized anonymous human shape , pure colorless geometry . <p> My mother in an evening gown , going out with one of the men she almost married . The gown is satin , the color of champagne . She 's been to the salon ; her hair is long and intricately waved , in the fashion of the early ' 70s . She looks complicated and perfect , like a quartz geode . The man she 's going out with stands in the doorway with his back to me . He 's wearing an expensive black suit ; his hair is dark . The back of his head is a sort of mineral shape , not inhuman , but belonging to no one in particular , to no one at all . They are going dancing , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and move them in ways dreamed of by other minds . Nothing they do will be theirs . And when they make love at the end of the evening , there will be nothing left of them , not even their names . <p> Giulio Camillo , dressed in silk , sitting on a balcony , contemplating a Renaissance street . The light looks the way light always looks in Renaissance paintings : pellucid , two-dimensional . Camillo sits for a long time , never moving . He is engaged in a meditational exercise requiring grave mental discipline . He is determined to summon into his conscious memory everything his mind has ever registered , beginning with the visual . The task is monumental , and will take him several lifetimes . When night falls , he will retire to his . study and work on the plan for his perfect memory theater . In the end , nothing will come of it except for a few arcane , complicated drawings and certain beautiful but useless pieces of furniture . When Camillo dies , the apocrypha say , his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vampire . <p> My father onstage with Coltrane , bent to his bass , eyes closed . Naima . He is sweating like a field hand  --  I have never before seen him sweat . <p> Something from my childhood : a sound in the night , my mother moaning . I get up and go to the window . There is an angel of blue fire standing beside the Japanese magnolia . No : it is only starlight on the blossoms . It is early spring , and the stars have come very close to the earth . I can name them all . <p> Clare in the moonlight . Clare in the library . Clare in the subway . Clare in the bathtub . Clare Clare Clare Clare Clare . <p> Why do you remember these things and not others ? Why do you remember them now ? <p> I want to say Accident , but there are no accidents . I want to say The will of God , but there is no God . I want to say Chemicals in the brain , but there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocaine could conjure up this image , this narrative , and not another . I want to say Nothing at all , but the world refuses to vanish . <p> Someone told me once  --  a friend of Clare 's , a nurse who worked in emergency rooms  --  how terribly hard it is to kill a healthy human being , how much the body wants to live and go on living forever . I believe that . I believe you could do terrible damage to one part of a body , and the other systems would still go on living out of sheer material will  --  pumping blood , lymph , oxygen , nervous electricity . I have a fantasy that , given sufficient pressure of pain and sufficient time , any part of the body could take over the functions of any or all of the others : that the spleen could learn to be a heart , that the appendix could turn itself into an intestine , that the lobed liver could remember what it means to be a brain . Why not ? In the fetus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all essentially the same ? <p> But it is also true that there are parts of the body so fragile they can not survive the simplest acts . Think of those self-made mystics of the 1960s who 'd shatter consciousness with sweet hits of acid so they could stare into the burning drift of the sun from Capricorn toward Aquarius until their retinas vaporized . That was one idea of heaven . There are people who so hate the body they do n't give a good goddamn . They gaze into fiery furnaces . They give up their eyes to the Holy . Think of them staring straight at the feverish ether . It must take the courage of the stupid , the joy of the mystically insane . <p> Do n't look at the eclipse , my mother told me . Even a second burns terrible gaps in the visible . <p> But how could that spectacular intelligence I knew as Clare disappear ? I saw bow long it took Clare to die  --  weeks in the white bed , wasting . Her brain was gone , flatlined . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh itself , it must , I knew , all be there . I spoke to her belly , trying to turn some switch . What must I say before her gut would wake up and think ? How long would it take to teach her ovaries to imagine me ? This is a tale Poe could have written : how , after years in a coma , suddenly memory took shape in her chambered lungs , gathering asthmatic images in the alveoli . <p> But Clare did n't stick around that long . She was in too big a hurry to turn herself into the most poetic of all subjects . <p> The chemistry was wrong . It was all off just a little , in some screwy oblique way that God Herself could not have foreseen . I ca n't say now just what the problem was . It may have been me , something gone wrong in the elemental nexus of the ganglia  --  I am now , and I surely have been , crazy . Or it may have been in the batch of stuff Stefan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's swindle . An assassination attempt . C17H21NO4 , it should have been  --  untouched by human hands , coke so pure you could never buy it on the street . But who knows what was really going on , down there in the molecules ? <p> Or maybe it was the three-way imbalance of Stefan , Armelia , and me . We combined and recombined . We made compounds and solutions . We precipitated , friends . We exploded . But there were too many of us for benzene , though we tried to make those elegant geometric rings : it takes no more than two for that , carbon and hydrogen . And we were too few for the dirty organic compound , the expensive glittering that looks so pure to our gross trans-microscopic eyes we call it snow . <p> C177H21NO 4 . We boneled in every conceivable configuration : two above and one below , one above and two below , three in line with one inverted , two combined and one excluded . It was more than I can now remember . I can bring back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can still hear the resonance of what goes on inside a test tube . I know I was the catalytic element , the passive one , unchanged and unchanging . I was at the center and they surrounded me ; they wanted to combine with me , to penetrate my electron shells and hydrogen bonds . But I was impervious . They broke their essences against the purity of my molecular shoreline . <p> I remember I was tied to the bed face down , then face up . I remember opening my mouth . I remember a penis between my breasts . I remember semen . I remember Armelia 's tongue inside me . I remember duplicity and decline and the laying on of hands . I remember the snow : line after line after line . There were times I was not even sure I was inside my own flesh . I could see through Armelia , into her uterus ; I could see what had broken there after the second abortion . Stefan , I know , was less transparent , as if he had another body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shining , like onyx . <p> None of this ever happened . I do n't want it to sound like a bad acid trip or a corny religious experience . I think the three of us were doing something we had always wanted to do , ever since we were star gas , swamp gas  --  not Armelia , Stefan , and me , but every human being who ever got up on two idiot legs and walked out on the prairie . It transcended fucking , though that 's what any sane human being would call it . It transcended murder , too . It was not hallucination . It was ordinary experience translated just a little , seen in some new way maybe , or seen at last for what it really is . You could say it was what Clare ran from at the end . You could say Armelia and Stefan  --  and it does n't really matter who they were ; they could have been anyone ; all our bodies could have been any body at all  --  were turning me into the anti-Clare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness ; it was being nothing but body , all physis . It was a final quenching of the spark without anything breaking down , without anything dying . <p> I do n't know how long it lasted . A long time . Days . I have lived a long time since . When it ended , it was the end of Stefan , Armelia , and me . Imagine atoms , bonded together into a substance like granite for forty million years , suddenly released by the action of something as random as wind or water . Would those atoms ever want to meet each other again ? Imagine a black woman walking in a forest , then suddenly snared by ropes . John Davidson Greene ? What kind of man is that with such glowing skin ? What kind of creature is that one he commands , with blinding wings , traveling so silently over the water ? Can she ever get back to the place she came from again ? <p> When I called out for my daddy , I did n't even know I was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't remember that , but Golden Brightman swears it 's so . He says he could hear it blasting down the hallway as soon as the elevator slid open on the 27th floor . Never mind that Stefan did n't own a single Coltrane disk ; it could have been the radio . Golden says he heard that tune and he felt the same sickness he 'd felt on the bandstand with Coltrane all those years before . He says he 'd almost forgotten how it felt back then , with everything that had happened since , and Coltrane dead . He says that as soon as he heard it , he felt twenty years younger in the worst of all possible ways . He says that was why , when he came down the hall , he was running . <p> I do n't know where my mind was , but it returned to me when I heard him hit the door : clarity , after all that time . I knew it was Golden Brightman yelling and beating the door with the palms of his beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I was tied to the bed again with blinding ropes the color of sunlight on snow ; my hands were tied and my feet were tied and my mouth was stopped with a silk scarf that tasted like the Shroud . I do n't know what they were doing to me , but I was bloody , in some half-serious way ; I could see the scratches on my belly . I could see Stefan 's eyes , and they were somebody else 's eyes , somebody he 'd really been every second , the whole time I 'd known him . His hands were on Armelia , those hands of an artist-butcher . Whatever he was doing with her , though , it was for the taste , not for the pain . <p> But when Stefan heard that crazy reggae pounding on the door , everything shifted . I do n't know what enzyme precipitated in that golden head of his . He looked past me , through me , seeing nothing I could name . His mustache was whitened with a fine fall of powder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood ringed his left nostril . <p> Bastards , he said , and he dived for the drawer where the gun was . <p> I was a prophet then , but there was nothing mystical in it . I could see what was coming like a vision , like a rerun of Miami Vice . I screamed , but nothing came out except a little music . I tried to rise up , but I could not get out of my body . And when the shot came , there was nothing left to say . <p> The door was made of metal , but the pistol was a Magnum . Serious artillery for serious wars , Stefan always said . And Golden Brightman was the luckiest man on the planet , always had been  --  that was his take on it later , and what the policeman said . It could have been anything . It could have been his head . <p> But it was his left hand , friends . I 'd like to tell you there was a beautiful stigmata  --  which could be a sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was more intense , more solemn . It was more like apocalypse on a microcosmic scale : flaming Armageddon in a grain of sand , a white-hot palmful of the Big Bang . <p> What was it like for him there on the other side of that door ? I 've never had the guts to ask him . He could hear " Naima " playing , and suddenly his left hand vaporized . I saw the hole in the metal later : exactly the size of your fist . <p> Mortmain . <p> Then everything was cool ; then there was no more music . <p> The policeman covered me with a blanket ; the policeman cut my cord . He had hair the color of locust and honey . He had the violent hands of a saint . <p> I went then in the clarity of my new life to Golden Brightman 's bedside . The hospital , I remember , was utterly silent , as if I had lost my hearing . He lay trapped in white cotton and stainless steel . There was something shapeless left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its bandage , signing like a cynical deaf-mute to a cynical deaf-mute . I could read that gesture 's text . What is said was Changes . <p> He did not smile . <p> About " Naima , " a musician friend of Golden 's told me that when Coltrane finished writing it , he walked away from the woman he wrote it for and never looked back . Deus absconditus . But what had I created in my impure soul ? What could I turn my back on ? <p> Make death die , wrote Valentinius the Gnostic . Clare whispered that to me the first time she made love to me . I touched my father 's forehead . <p> The rest , as the man said , is pure ungodly silence . <p> <p> By T. R. HUMMER <p>
