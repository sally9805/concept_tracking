With lights flashing and sirens screaming , ambulances all across the U.S. rushed patients to hospitals run by Columbia/HCA Healthcare last week . But those were not the only emergencies taking place at the country 's largest hospital company . Even as Columbia was growing and doing record business , a fight for survival had broken out inside the executive suite after swarms of federal agents descended on various Columbia offices two weeks ago . The climax came at 8:30 a.m. last Friday , following an extraordinary board meeting held late into the previous night , when directors wrapped up the terms of the resignations of chairman and CEO Richard Scott , 45 , Columbia 's visionary founder , and president David Vandewater , 46 . The big winner was new chairman and CEO Thomas Frist Jr. , 58 , a physician whose family founded HCA before Columbia acquired it in 1994 . <P> In fact , Frist and the rest of the board had begun to fear for the survival of Columbia ( 1996 revenues : $19.9 billion ) , which has long been a lightning rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott 's stonewalling of federal probes of Columbia 's Medicare billings and home-health-care practices would only inflame the zeal of investigators and prosecutors and make a face-saving settlement impossible . And Columbia , which is based in Nashville , Tenn. , was reportedly exploring a merger with Tenet Healthcare of Santa Barbara , Calif. , the country 's second largest hospital company . That deal would have been threatened by Columbia 's prospective legal problems . <P> Frist , who had been serving as Columbia 's vice chairman and was growing increasingly disenchanted with Scott 's leadership , wasted no time in signaling his willingness to cooperate with federal investigators . Frist said he was " dead serious " about addressing Washington 's concerns and would launch at least three internal probes this week to ascertain whether company managers had broken any laws . <P> For Scott , a lawyer by training , the abrupt departure marks the end of a wunderkind career as the health-care industry 's most ambitious  --  and controversial  --  empire builder . A headstrong , self-centered manager  --  " He regards anyone who is not totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Scott has always been a man in a hurry . In 1987 he and Richard Rainwater , a Fort Worth , Texas , billionaire , each invested $125,000 in a pair of struggling hospitals in El Paso , Texas . That became the seed for Columbia 's present holdings of 1,062 hospitals , outpatient surgical centers and home-health-care centers in 36 states , England , Switzerland and Spain . <P> In the end , Scott 's hubris may have cost him his empire . Amid signs of growing trouble at Columbia , he continued to pursue business as usual . In fact , the business was going badly askew . The problems worsened in March when agents descended on Columbia hospitals in El Paso , scooping up medical files by the truckload . Among other things , the feds sought evidence that Columbia , which treats some 125,000 patients a day , had overcharged Medicare by millions of dollars . Two weeks ago , federal agents seized documents from 31 Columbia locations in six states ( Florida , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Tennessee , Texas and Utah ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Postal Service to the departments of Defense and Health and Human Services had obtained more than 35 warrants that target the company .
