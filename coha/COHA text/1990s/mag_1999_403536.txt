Sprawling airports , traffic jams , and big hospitals could disappear as new technologies become commonplace in the next 150 years , according to a noted science-fiction writer . // As new technologies replace the old , it 's inevitable that given enough time some aspects of our culture will completely disappear . The question is : What will we lose ? What started me thinking about this was a call from our local suburban newspaper , The Herald . The paper was coming up on its 150th birthday , and they decided to celebrate it by trying to look 150 years into the future . As part of the event they asked me to identify five familiar things that wo n't be around 150 years from now . In putting together my list , I pondered all sorts of " possible futures , " or futuribles , to use a term coined by the French futurologist Bertrand de Jouvenel . Based on future events that may or may not happen , but perhaps can happen , here 's my list of some of the things that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century : 1 . Airports . 2 . Traffic jams . 3 . Computers . 4 . TV sets . 5 . Hospitals . Actually , I do n't think it will take 150 years for most of those things to disappear . I think airports may be one of the first to go , because there are futuribles on the horizon that may very well make giant , sprawling airports like O'Hare obsolete a long time before then . For example , consider the fact that today 's airports take up such a huge amount of real estate . You ca n't fit an airport inside any major city anymore ; you ca n't even build them reasonably close to the city they 're meant to serve-witness Denver 's new airport , twice as far from downtown as the old one was . What takes up all the space is those sprawling , miles-long runways that today 's jets require . I do n't think that kind of space will be necessary for tomorrow 's aircraft . One futurible that has a good shot at obsoleting them are the vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military . These aircraft can take off and land nearly straight up , and the maximum runway length they need is less than a city block . The Return of Zeppelins But they 're not the futuribles that I think will put the mammoth runways out of business . Another interesting prospect is lighter-than-air transport , by which I do n't mean the blimps that take TV camera crews over the World Series and the Super Bowl games . I mean dirigibles : actual , rigid zeppelins , much like the kind the Germans employed to bomb London in World War I. You have to be a pretty senior citizen to ever have seen a zeppelin in the air . They simply have n't been around lately , but the German company of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin is trying to change all that . They have recently finished building and flying a brand-new zeppelin , more than 60 years after the Hindenburg crashed and burned . That disastrous event hit the headlines , shocked the world , and pretty much put an end to zeppelin travel for a couple of generations . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to the new model ; it is constructed of carbon composites instead of aluminum and steel , and its lifting gas is helium , not hydrogen , and helium wo n't burn . The new version is far safer than the Hindenburg and may well be safer than today 's jetliners . A dirigible is unlikely to crash as long as it stays out of major storms , which are what did in most of our American dirigible fleet . And it 's safer than a jet even if it does crash , because dirigibles have the happy trait of crashing slowly ; remember that half the passengers and crew on the Hindenburg walked away from the crash . Ecologically , though not necessarily economically , zeppelins are cheaper than jet travel . A jet has to use a lot of fuel simply to keep itself airborne ; a dirigible , which simply floats in the air , does n't have that problem . And zeppelin travel has advantages all its own . One advantage that particularly appeals to me is that zeppelins give you something to look at , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are also a lot quieter than jets , which is a big plus for people who live or work near airports and is another reason why zeppelins could actually take off and land within a city . Zeppelin travel does have one drawback . It 's a lot slower than a jet . You might need two or three days , instead of 10 hours , to get from Chicago to London . But even that is n't entirely bad , since it would solve the problem of jet lag . There 's also a very attractive new travel niche that zeppelins could fill , and nothing else can . That 's what I think of as overland cruise ships . Cruising is what just about all seagoing liners do now ; they 're built not to take their passengers from one place to another , but to sail them around to see interesting sights and at the end come right back to where they started . And they 're vastly popular . More and bigger cruise ships are being launched and filled with passengers every year . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can go is to seaports . And , unfortunately for the cruise planners , a lot of the world 's most interesting places are a long way from any ocean . Would you like to sign up for a dirigible cruise to , say , Gettysburg , Aspen , and Yellowstone , all on one comfortable trip ? Zeppelins would make that possible . And the noise would n't even sacre the grizzlies . Hig-Speed Surface Transport Another reason why I think airports are likely to become history before very many decades have passed is that air travel itself will decline drastically , replaced by high-speed surface transport . Photograph A brand-new zeppelin uses helium to lift off for a safe and quiet ride . Fleets of modern dirigibles could offer airborne luxury cruises as an alternative to jet travel , according to the author . // I 'm not talking about the Japanese bullet trains or the French train a grande vitesse . I enjoy riding in those when I get the chance , because they 're surely a lot better than Amtrak , but they are n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that kind of mass transport that comes from some scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island . When I mention this idea , people tend to think I 'm talking about some future kind of railroad trains , but that 's wrong . These machines do n't run on rails , and they are n't trains . You start with magnetic levitation-maglev for short-in which vehicles are magnetically suspended , friction free , a few inches above their roadway . People have been fooling with maglev for at least 30 years , without much hope of economic success , but the Brookhaven scientists have a new way of looking at it . They propose to forget about connecting strings of cars together to make trains . What they 're talking about is single cars , carrying no more than a dozen or so passengers each . The cars are extremely lightweight compared with the usual railroad behemoth : They would weigh not much more than the van in your garage-maybe even less , since they do n't have to carry their own fuel or much of a motor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individually computer controlled . And you do n't have to worry about missing one : Another one will be along in a minute . The Brookhaven people say they could run even more frequently , maybe one every 20 seconds . A good way to visualize how they would operate is to think of the elevators in a tall building . Like an elevator , these vehicles do n't stop unless someone wants to either get on or get off . When you ride one , you get in at Station B on your line , put your credit card in the slot , and press the buttons for your destination at Station M. Your car starts off . It automatically goes off on a siding to pick up someone at Station F who wants to go to Station X , then goes back on the main line . It stops again at Station J , where somebody who got on at Station A wants to get off . But it skips every station in between , stopping only where someone wants to get off or where some waiting passenger has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a pretty jazzy idea , but you can probably see that it has two big problems . One of them may already have been solved , at least in principle . That 's the problem , common to every scheme of this size , of where to put it . Rights of way are fearfully expensive , especially since so many of the ones we did have have been abandoned . The Brookhaven researchers have come up with a promising suggestion : Use the parkway strips in the middle of the interstates , just as Chicago did when it extended its Blue Line El trains out to O'Hare inside the Kennedy Expressway . The big remaining problem , of course , is money . The Brookhaven people calculate that a 16,000-mile system , crossing the United States and linking many major cities , would cost about $200 billion . That 's not chump change . On the other hand , it 's only about 1% of what we 're going to be spending on transportation over the next couple of decades anyway . Once you had the system running , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need to do is put up sidings and station platforms anywhere along the route , in any little town , village , or road intersections or shopping malls . No More Traffic Jams Something like the Brookhaven scheme , applied to commuter transport , could do a lot to reduce traffic jams , too . It is notoriously difficult to get Americans out of their cars , but if commuters are given a choice between quick and convenient Brookhaven-like transport and the present dreary one-car-one-passenger crawl along Chicago 's rush-hour Kennedy Expressway , with the sun in your eyes both ways , it could happen . And that would not only eliminate the traffic jams on the commuter roads , it would help keep a lot of cars out of the cities as well . That 's the real solution to traffic jams : cutting down on the number of cars . In that connection , there 's a British scheme-invented , designed , and tested , but never put into practice-for making driving a personal car inside London , or any other traffic-choked city , if not prohibited at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radio-controlled meter , something like the gadgets now in use for letting drivers breeze through toll gates , so that each minute spent on downtown streets would be charged for . I 'm afraid that 's a futurible that does n't have much chance of becoming real any time soon , but something like it would make a huge difference in urban traffic congestion . And once inside the city you would get around , much more rapidly , on buses and taxis-probably hybrid electric in both cases ; that is , electric vehicles with a small gasoline engine that runs constantly at its most efficient speed , saving gas and drastically cutting emissions , so that idling at a stoplight does n't waste energy . The vehicles , of course , might be all-electric . But in places like Chicago I think not ; the gas-electrics have a special advantage over allelectrics in Midwest winters : They have much better heaters . Television , Computers , And Virtual Reality That takes care of airports and traffic jams . Now let 's get to the next pair of things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing that I anticipate is n't exactly a futurible , because it 's very nearly here already : the merger of these two separate gadgets , probably into a single-fit screen , and very likely with one on the wall of every room of the house . When you want to compute , it 's your computer screen ; when you want to watch David Letterman or the ball game or a movie , it 's your TV/cassette player . And when you do n't want either it 's a kind of screen saver , a decoration like the pictures you hang on the wall now but animated , showing a seascape or a forest with the leaves stirring , or anything that turns you on . Actually , they may go a little farther than that . Argonne National Laboratory has what they call " The Cave , " a virtual-reality installation . You get inside it and put on a pair of trick glasses with lenses that alternate between opaque and showing a scene ; the flipover happens so fast that you ca n't see it . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , so that you are viewing it in 3-D , and the scene can be anything you like . Or at least , anything that is in the datastore , which currently ranges from the inside of a nuclear explosion to childbirth . That 's a little clumsy for home use , but it 's just the beginning ; virtualreality viewing is a pretty probable futurible for the not-very-distant future . Whatever specific kind of gadget you have , it will no doubt be voice operated , but when you do want to compute you wo n't have to go where the keypad is . You may have it right on your person all the time . This latest wrinkle I saw demonstrated recently when I was invited to take part in a symposium on wearable computers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . It was an exciting weekend , and there were a lot of models of wearable computers around . Some of the guys had taken metallic threads and embroidered actual keypads on their T-shirts , so they could input whatever they likedshopping lists , memos , e-mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , four of them had hooked up their embroidered keypads to music synthesizers and gave us a four-part rendition of old barber-shop favorites from the platform . One of the scientists wore his wearable computer in a different way . The keypad was strapped to his right thigh , mounted on a device that resembled a cellular phone , linked to a larger computer somewhere nearby . He wore a headband with a tiny screen , reflected onto a mirror positioned before his right eye-he reserved his left eye for seeing where he was going . With this setup he could access any of MIT 's data banks and display whatever he wanted to know whenever he chose , making it very handy for , say , settling barroom arguments about Ted Williams 's batting average or which was the shortest way to drive to somewhere on Route 128 . Or for more practical uses : He claimed he could do his tax return while he was jogging . There 's another futurible application of these glasses that I think would be of great value for some people . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charley , " who had a distinguished career in the military and as a writer and educator . Unfortunately he also had a major sideline career in drinking . After 30 or 40 years of dedication to the bottle he wound up with a wet brain . Every morning he had to walk from his son 's house , where he was living , to the sheltered workshop where he spent his days , and every evening he had to walk back . It was only about a dozen blocks , but there were three or four turnings , and every once in a while he got lost . There are in the United States hundreds of thousands of people who have Charley 's problem , not necessarily from alcoholism . For many of them , if they could be fitted with something like those one-eye glasses , showing them maps of where they were supposed to go , possibly even with pictures of what the intersections looked like , it could give them mobility without needing someone to escort them wherever they have to go . In fact , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three start-up companies around Cambridge who are working on developing these devices for general use . I do n't think they have anything on the commercial market yet , but I think it wo n't be long before you can have one of these things for yourself , if you do n't mind walking around looking like a Buck Rogers Martian . Of course , the reason most computers will disappear is simply that they will be tiny and tucked out of sight . Even now , we 're likely to have at least a dozen computers in our cars and almost as many in our washing machines or other household **26;975;TOOLONG computers , no bigger than a chip , each doing its own dedicated job . You wo n't have to get along without computing facilities in the future , but I 'm pretty sure that before long you 'll have junked the old desktop . Shrinking Hospitals The last thing I think will disappear is hospitals . I do n't mean to suggest that our grandchildren wo n't have all the medical care they need-on the contrary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot better and a lot cheaper than is available to us today . It 's the huge physical plants of today that I expect to go the way of the passenger pigeon and the dodo . Think about it . Who are the people who fill the beds in these hospitals ? A large fraction of them are patients who have just had , or are about to have , major surgery . But what makes most major surgery major is n't so much what needs to be done inside your body ; the reason surgeons have to slice your belly open from the guzzle to the glotch to get at your abdomen , or to split your sternum and jack your ribs apart to get to the chest cavity , is simply that their hands are so big . It 's in order to get their hands inside you , to where the problem is , that they have to make those great incisions . But there 's a futurible that can get around that problem . Robert A. Heinlein invented it in a science-fiction story more than 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hooked up by wire or by radio to another glove somewhere else . Your glove is full of sensors , which mark every movement of your fingers . The other glove then mimics them exactly . And the other glove does n't have to be the same size , or strength , as your hand . You can use big , strong ones if you want to lift and carry pigs of iron from a smelter . Or you can use gloves small enough to slide easily between the ribs if you want to get at the place where you want to do that triple bypass . When this idea was still only science fiction , Bob Heinlein called such things " waldoes " - after the name of the man who invented them in his story . Now they 're called something like " remote manipulators , " and , whatever you call them , they are n't science fiction anymore . For the surgical application , manipulators have already been built that can cut and suction and inject , and they 're getting better all the time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can feel what his manipulator is doing , as he is accustomed to do with his own fingers . The very newest is capable even of tying up the stitches to close an incision . I do n't believe those have yet been used in actual surgery on human patients , but I 'd be willing to bet that it will happen within the next couple of years , maybe sooner . We could look a little farther into the future , too . A surgeon friend of mine has a slogan posted on the wall of his office . It 's a quotation from William Harvey , who , a few centuries ago , discovered the circulation of the blood and a lot of other things : " Surgery is what we do before we know how to treat a condition . " The history of medicine shows how right Harvey was . We 've already seen that there are a lot of serious medical problems that are better treated with something other than surgery ; for gangrene of a limb , for instance , for centuries the only effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibiotic save the life and the limb as well . I do n't know what the next great therapeutic advance is going to be . I do know of some interesting futuribles : gene splicing , to prevent inherited diseases from ever manifesting themselves in reality ; pharmaceuticals capable of starving a cancer of its blood supply and thus letting it simply wane away and disappear , instead of having to be cut out of the body ; chemicals that bind to malignant cells and respond to X-rays , so that radiation can be focused on only the cells that are to be destroyed and do no harm to healthy tissues-and so on and on . The thing about these futuribles is that they are likely often to be procedures that can be done in the doctor 's office , for outpatients ; no giant hospitals needed , only what will look more like emergency rooms , a fraction the size of the present institutions . Transplants , Artificial Skin , and Cyborgs As long as we 're on the subject , let 's talk about one or two other medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment is the replacement of defective parts with transplants or prostheses . The big problem with transplants is that , unless they 're a nearly perfect genetic match , the patient 's immune system treats them as alien invaders and rejects them . There are things that can be done about that , but they all carry heavy penalties of one kind or another ; so there 's a lot of research going on in trying to find artificial organs . Some of them do n't seem to be working out very well-the artificial heart , for instance . One particularly probable futurible is artificial blood : no worries about supplies , because you just manufacture as much as you need ; no problems of rejection ; no risk of catching something from the donor . Artificial skin is a pretty close-by futurible . In fact , it already exists . You may remember newspaper accounts of how Betty Shabazz , Malcolm X 's widow , was severely burned over much of her body a year or two ago . Most of her skin was hopelessly destroyed . She needed new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin is used for such purposes , but for Shabazz they used the very latest in integuments : a synthetic skin made of collagen from cows and cartilage from sharks . In Betty Shabazz 's case it came to a bad end , because the burns were too serious and she died . But the synthetic skin worked . How much further can this go ? In science fiction , at least , quite a lot further . Some years ago I wrote a novel called Man Plus , which was about an astronaut who was made into a cyborg so that he could live on the surface of Mars without wearing a space suit : Skin was replaced with synthetic epidermis that was safe against the deadly ultraviolet radiation the surface of Mars gets from the Sun , and he had photovoltaic arrays , like great bat wings , to provide energy . Not much of this was my invention : It was based on some theoretical work done by a couple of NASA doctors , back in the 1950s , who proposed turning astronauts into cybernetic organisms-cyborgs-for that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in just that way , in the real world . That sort of first-contact planetary exploration is more likely to be done by robots , like the little Sojourner that was sniffing around Martian rocks . But some of us current human beings are already heading in that direction . I have n't gone quite that far personally , but I can already claim to be a little bit of a cyborg myself : I have a couple of pieces of Gore-Tex installed in my belly to keep my guts in place and to prevent my aorta from exploding , as well as some bits of plastic in my eyes that replaced my cataracts and , for the first time since I was 10 years old , gave me 20-20 vision without glasses . I 'm not yet the Six Million Dollar Man-say , roughly , the $90,000 one so far . Then there are the futuribles in prostheses , beyond the glasses , the hearing aids , the pacemakers , and all the other gadgets that currently do their best to make our bodies function normally . Do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so . I think that when the prosthetics and implant makers get really good at what they 're doing we may get into a new field I call " recreational prostheses . " I think its first applications may be in professional sports-the same people who dose themselves with steroids and methamphetamines probably would n't mind getting the kind of pacemaker that can speed the heart up or improve musculature so they can run faster , jump higher , and hit a ball farther than anybody ever could before . All that might be illegal , of course . But , hey , so are the spitball and the plugged bat . Photograph Researchers use virtual reality glasses to simulate the interior of an industrial boiler . The desktop computer could soon be replaced by a voice-activated computertelevision that features virtual reality viewing .
