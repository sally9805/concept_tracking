<p> Pull of Unity , Push of Splintering <p> United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali spoke to Monitor contributor Lucia Mouat in New York : <p> WE are confronted by two different things . One is fragmentation . When the UN was created we had 51 member states . Today , 50 years later , we have 185 members . The civil war in Yugoslavia is an example of this fragmentation of the family of nations . The UN has participated in this through its role in decolonization . <p> But at the same time , we are confronted by something new which I call globalization , problems in the field of communication , disease , drugs , environment - Chernobyl is an example - that have no borders . <p> Over the next 50 years we will be confronted by this dialectic relation where on the one side you will have more globalization , and on the other side we may have more fragmentation . <p> It is a big challenge , but I believe the UN has the capacity to manage the globalization and contain the fragmentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Borders Belong to the Efficient <p> Kenichi Ohmae , author of " The Borderless World " ( 1990 ) , " The End of the Nation-State " ( 1995 ) , and other books , spoke from Tokyo : <p> WHAT will happen to the world 's nations depends on how well we harness technologies . <p> The Internet community , for instance , ignores national borders . Companies can use technologies to transfer services across countries . You can have an efficient production plant in South Dakota or in India . <p> Worldwide autonomous regions of production are being created , from Bangalore to Singapore . More natural units of economy are emerging . The ideal is 3 million to 5 million people , very visible to world investors and consumers , but not so complex to govern . <p> By 2010 , the world will develop into a network of similar production communities , emerging states that do n't need military force , large land masses , or natural resources . <p> New Zealand and Ireland , for instance , are attracting companies because they have enlightened workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high educational level , and reasonably high unemployment . <p> Bangalore uses satellite dishes to connect with the world , avoiding the bad land lines that are common in India . It 's wired itself to the world community . It 's even building its own small power plants . <p> In Dalian in northeast China , half of the industrial investment is foreign , and the city is becoming less connected to Beijing . <p> The emerging states of the world are those with credible management teams . <p> Over the past 30 to 40 years , national leaders have fought for broader alliances - the EU , NAFTA , ASEAN - to deal with the problems of the traditional nation state . Once you form these alliances , however , the bureaucracy becomes overwhelming to administer the larger unit . This pushes people to find more basic units of commonality with historical , ethnic , linguistic , or technological bonds . <p> The EU attempt to end nation-state borders has forced its people to establish their identities along ethnic lines . Smaller units will emerge as national borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger today , and they may form a new state . <p> As NAFTA grows , what will Nova Scotia have in common with Vancouver ? Canada 's cities and provinces will look south , not to Ottawa : British Columbia will look to Washington State , Ontario will join the Great Lakes area . <p> The same is true with Mexico : The northern part can join the US and leave the south isolated from prosperity . <p> In China , the government can not control 1.2 billion people under one doctrine , with so many tribes and dialects . The only way is military force to keep unity . <p> Deng Xiaoping created economic zones with autonomy to deal with foreign investors , but Beijing does n't get the money . Now it is tightening the controls with national taxes , but to no avail . No one sees the value of central government . The southern provinces have gone too far to be called back by Beijing . <p> In Russia , that country may not be the optimal economic unit in the 21st century . If Siberia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Moscow will never do it . It 'll see a challenge to its authority in Siberia . <p> Hundreds of New Flags Will Unfurl <p> Richard C. Carlson is the chairman of Spectrum Economics in Palo Alto , Calif . He is the author of " Twenty Twenty Visions : a Long View of a Changing World " ( 1991 ) and , with Bruce Goldman , " Fast Forward : Where Technology , Demographics , and History Will Take America &; the World in the Next Thirty Years " ( 1994 ) . <p> THE concept of national borders has shifted throughout history and will continue to change . The most rigid concept of borders - a physical barrier that severely limits the passage of people , products , and information - reached its peak during the cold war when several Communist nations - e.g. Albania and North Korea - tried to completely cut themselves off from the world . <p> This attempt at isolation was both doomed to failure and doomed these nations to ultimate economic and political collapse . No period of human history , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The questions for 50 years from now are not just where will the borders be , but which borders will be left , if any , and what will these remaining borders mean ? Several things are nearly certain : <p> *Borders will be meaningless for information flows . Any attempt to stop audio , video , and data from moving anywhere at anytime will be hopeless . <p> *Money , which now is little more than bits of data , will move instantly and without restriction around the planet . Money in most of the world will be denominated in one to three world currencies . <p> *Products will move without restriction among developed and undeveloped nations , but there will still be limited residual restrictions on product movements between developed and undeveloped nations . <p> *Borders will become meaningless for the movement of people among developed nations , but severe border restrictions will remain between the developed and undeveloped world and among undeveloped ( and collapsing ) nations . Going from England to the United States will be like traveling from Kansas to Nebraska . <p> *Borders will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be automatic , and everyone of consequence under age 30 will probably speak English . <p> *National citizenship will have two meanings in the developed world : membership in nation-based social-welfare systems ( with most of the younger generation opting out of these collapsed or collapsing systems ) and national voting . <p> There will be only one border that really counts by 2050 , the border between the modern , developed world and the world of chaos . <p> The developed world will include most of the Americas ( Brazil being the big question mark ) , Europe , Japan , and much of Asia . Within this world borders will be largely meaningless . <p> The world of chaos will include most of Africa , Pakistan , Bangladesh , parts of India , and parts of China , where demographic , economic , and political troubles will have overwhelmed social order and cohesion . Border conflicts will continue in these tragic parts of the world . <p> In the interim decades , the world has many border conflicts to look forward to . Borders are far from settled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and most of the former Soviet Union . <p> China may well attempt to maintain its political cohesion by trying to expand its own borders through military force into Russia and Southeast Asia . Russia , Japan , and the US can not tolerate such behavior . Any such attempt would only hasten the political collapse and division of China . <p> Strangely , the world will have more borders as well as fewer . Many large nations will break down into smaller more " autonomous " regions where attempts will be made to protect language and cultural cohesion . <p> These attempts will ultimately fail under the information onslaught of world technology , but meanwhile the world will see dozens if not hundreds of new flags unfurled from Catalonia ( Spain ) to Quebec . <p> Mega-Networks Redraw Asia Map <p> John Naisbitt , author of " Megatrends " and the soon-to-be published " Megatrends Asia , " gave this assessment in an interview from Cambridge , Mass. : <p> THE cross-border economic activity of the 57 million Overseas Chinese outside China is a country all by itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family businesses in Southeast Asia are networks of companies . They are not a nation-state , but a network of networks . The world is moving from a collection of nation-states to a collection of networks . And Asia is where the action is going to be .
