TITLES : SOMMERSBY AND THE VANISHING <P> GENRE : MISSING-PERSON DRAMA , EXPORTED TO HOLLYWOOD <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : Cultural transplants improve two European art-house hits . <P> Americans  --  go figure . They ca n't make a better car or car stereo . They ca n't stanch their national debt . They ca n't impose a new world order . But they can fix up a foreign-movie drama like doctors slapping an anemic newborn into shape until it is a bionic baby . It looks so smart , so strong , so very . . . Hollywood . <P> Sommersby , about a young Tennessee husband who goes away to the Civil War and comes home a changed man , is based on the 1982 French film The Return of Martin Guerre . The Vanishing , the tale of a young Seattle woman who goes away for a beer and never comes home , is a remake of a 1988 Dutch thriller . The original movies had their admirers , but neither property could be sold as is to the U.S. mass audience . Some expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to approach the European originals not as finished portraits but as sketches in need of coherence , heart , pizazz . It 's what rewriters do : refashion a boutique item so it will jump off the shelves at the mall . <P> The Vanishing  --  directed in both versions by George Sluizer  --  misplaces its leading lady early . She disappears at a highway rest stop , leaving her lover Jeff ( Kiefer Sutherland ) angry , then for years obsessed . He wants to know what happened . We already do . At least , we know whodunit . Barney ( Jeff Bridges ) , a nerdy schoolteacher with the improbable accent of a Swedish Peter Lorre , has abducted her and taken her to his lakeside cottage . When Barney reveals himself , Jeff must decide whether his need to know the ending , even a tragic one , to his story  --  and they all died horribly ever after  --  is worth putting his fate in Barney 's treacherous hands . <P> Such was the moral of the Dutch Vanishing : curiosity killed the cat . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a third act . Enter screenwriter Todd Graff ( Used People ) . He takes the original 's perplexing flashback structure , flattens it out and fattens it up , mostly by creating a new character , a waitress ( Nancy Travis ) who falls in love with Jeff . Graff changes the theme : now knowledge is just a cue for righteous revenge . The Dutch movie had no gun ; in a Hollywood thriller there must be a gun , and it will go off . The original 's ending was misanthropic , claustrophobic  --  a fellow in a tight spot with no way out but death . Graff provides a rousingly standard climax , putting the heroine at mortal risk in an old dark house and then letting her triumph . It makes for sturdy melodrama , old-style . You 've seen it work a million times . Well , it works again . <P> Martin Guerre was an art-house hit , and is the source for a new musical with Broadway hopes . The story , based on 16th century fact , raised poignant issues : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he be someone else , someone better ? What matters in a lover : his identity or his behavior ? And , given the choice , would we trade him in for a model that was new , improved  --  and a fraud ?
