In the room in Mexico where they finally reunited , Bird knelt by the bed , Kin lay on it as he 'd done for weeks , and JJ settled into the canvas butterfly chair at its foot . Bird often knelt by Kin 's bed these days , as if praying  --  which she also often did these days , though not on her knees . She had written JJ at last because Kin had grown weak so quickly here . Propping another pillow behind Kin 's head now , Bird noticed he 'd muted the new plum-dark lesion on his chin with base and powder . JJ seemed to be studying that very spot . He unhooked from his ears the sunglasses he 'd worn for his car trip from Phoenix . His eyes were as Bird remembered-blue and green and gray . All three at once . <p> Awkward after eight years apart from them , JJ shifted in the chair . He fiddled with his sunglasses . Bird blushed , wishing she could set him at ease . But Kin , she knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After me , " Kin asked JJ , " were there any other men ? " <p> JJ 's bony face remained blank . His voice came out flatly matterof-fact . " No , " he said . " None after my summer with you , you and Bird ... " <p> " Well , I 've had a few . " Kin managed a grin . Half closing his eyes , he described the lovers Bird knew to be his favorites . The fellow Pan Am steward he worked with for a year ; the man he met on a beach in Greece ; the young man in Brazil ; the older man he seduced in his mom 's native Taiwan . Except for the steward , none had spoken much English . " But then , that 's what I craved . " Kin raised one delicate eyebrow . " Touching without talking . " JJ nodded . Bird watched his hands fondle the sunglasses . <p> " Of course , " Kin went on more slowly , " I 've always gotten plenty of talk with Bird . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been traveling . And sometimes now I worry that she did n't  --  " Kin slid his black eyes to her , a cough rumbling in his throat . His lusterless hair swayed . <p> " Get anything else , " she finished for him . She touched his shoulder , steadied him as his cough died down . " Then again , " she added in a rush , " I worry that I did n't want you to have much more than sex with those men . " Kin gave a slight nod , looking drained by his coughs . " And me , " Bird continued softly . " God . You know better than anyone , Sister Kin , that except for our summer with JJ , I have n't wanted anything but talking ... " <p> Nervously , she ran her hand over her scalp , her hair bleached white by the desert sun and chopped short  --  like a monk 's , Kin used to say . He 'd dropped that description these past weeks , once she 'd begun seeing Estella Hinojosa . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sister Kin voice . " Want to tell JJ how things 've heated up for you , down here ? " The voice was more hoarse than its original version . But Bird smiled , knowing it must remind JJ , too , of Kin 's old apartment , the fondue that had smelled of Sterno , the lingering talks in which Kin drew out his two shy guests , the long nights on Kin 's small futon . Sister Kin lowered his voice coaxingly . " Tell us , come on . What all did happen with you and Estella last night ? " <p> Bird looked down . She lifted Kin 's ice bag off a battered paperback on Buddhism . Books in English were hard to come by here . She handed him a chip of ice . As she drew a shuddery breath to speak , Kin cracked the ice between his teeth , then told JJ , " Estella is Bird 's new sweetie . Estella Hinojosa . " <p> Bird felt her flush deepen . Her leather jacket was ridiculously hot , but she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at JJ , freshly amazed by his presence . His eyes fixed wholly on her now , as if he 'd been waiting for a chance to stare . And Bird sensed that something more than talk might yet happen among the three of them . <p> Staying on her knees , Bird told JJ how one June evening she 'd walked with the kids down the hill to a small racetrack outside of town . She 'd wanted to see the imported greyhounds run . To try her luck at betting , raise some pesos . <p> " And I did . Won my first-ever bet . Which was great since we 'd been living on the last of Kin 's Pan Am money . So I was grinning , feeling good , wishing Kin could 've come . Then at the cash-in booth , a guy tried to pick me up . Bragged that he spoke English , that he worked at the track , that he had to ' take care of ' this white-speckled greyhound that 'd snapped its leg in the race I 'd won . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ? He said , The opposite of what it usually means . I was so high on winning that I followed him under the stands to these cages . This stink of raw meat and dogshit and dog . One greyhound was lying outside a cage . So thin , his organs showed through his skin . I swear : round shapes of his liver and intestines . Like meat through butcher paper . The guy told me , That dog wo n't even make it into your tacos . " <p> As if he had n't heard all this before , Kin winced . Bird pulled herself up , brushing off her jeans . Weighted by her jacket , she paced beside the bed . <p> " You were getting scared  --  ? " Kin prompted from his pillow . " Scared to be alone with this guy  --  he smelled like dog meat-when I spotted another guy stepping from behind the cages , holding another starved-looking dog . I backed away , real scared till the other guy stepped into light . And it was n't a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estella . " <p> Bird stopped at the doorway , her back to JJ as she remembered Estella holding out the limp , whimpering dog . Slowly , Bird slipped off her leather jacket and draped it over her arm . Her skin tingled with relief . She breathed in , feeling her breasts strain her tank top . Exhaling , she met JJ 's eyes . <p> " Right from the start , Estella was staring at me like  --  " Bird grinned at JJ , showing her teeth with all their gaps . " You , right now . <p> Kin choked , laughing . And JJ  --  looking startled , as if he had n't known he was staring  --  joined in with his low , dry laugh . Bird widened her grin . Their laughter mixed as naturally now as eight years before . All of them barely in their twenties then . <p> " Anyhow . " She paced more slowly , wondering where she was leading . " I wound up helping Estella Hinojosa load the dog into her old Bonneville convertible . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette . Like this . " Bird shook one from a pack lying on the radio . Lighting it , she sucked a mouthful of smoke . As gently as Estella had done in the hot , starry dark of the parking lot , Bird knelt on the bed and slipped the cigarette between Kin 's lips . They 'd been smoking together since high school . <p> " Muchas gracias , " he murmured . These days , though he barely inhaled , he savored his cigarettes . <p> " Then she asked if I was hungry . " Bird resettied the jacket on her arm , watching JJ watch Kin . " I rode with the dog 's head in my lap . Her house was off by itself  --  lotsa roses climbing the walls and a yard full of dogs . " Bird breathed Kin 's smoke , remembering the rich smells of Estella 's kitchen . " She fed the dog first , then me . Hauled out a pot to make sopa . She had  --  has  --  big hands and a long horsey face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coarser , like a real horse 's tail . Like  --  " Bird glanced at JJ . He was still watching Kin smoke . " Yours . " She stood , surprised and ashamed by a little flare of jealousy inside her . <p> " So anyhow , I ate . The kitchen was steamy , and we both smelled of dog . Estella asked , real polite , in Spanish , if I wanted a bath . " <p> Kin cleared his throat loudly . Bird looked down . " And I asked myself : Do I want a bath ? " She drew a breath of smoke , feeling JJ 's eyes shift to her . " I did . So she ran me a bath in her old-fashioned boat tub , and I  --  do n't know why ; I just knew it was what she wanted  --  I said , in Spanish , You wan na watch ? " Bird met JJ 's gaze . She wanted him to understand what had happened to her this summer , how it was the first time since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's how it started , our routine . Couple of nights a week . We 'd meet at the track and bet . Then we 'd pick up any dogs worth saving . I 'd help feed the dogs and we 'd eat and if I felt like it , I 'd take a bath . She 'd lean on the sink , smoking and watching . Then "  --  Bird turned from JJ  --  " she 'd pay me . For feeding the dogs , she said . But it was for the bath . I wanted to bathe for her , so it seemed ... " She silently asked Kin to find a word . The Spanish she 'd been learning escaped her now . <p> " Cool , " he muttered through his smoke . <p> Bird nodded . " Round July , " she hurried on , watching JJ half smile at Kin , " I managed to tell her I wanted to , needed to , learn to drive . " <p> " You still are n't driving ? " JJ blinked and turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said straight to him , " why I never learned ? " <p> JJ nodded slowly . Only he and Kin knew what Stepdad #2 had done to her when he was supposed to be teaching her to drive the family Vega . Two of his fingers thrust up inside her . Bird slung her jacket over her bare shoulder . As she paced again by the bed , she described how Estella let her bump the Bonneville up and down her dusty side street . How sometimes Estella 's thigh would brush her own , or how Estella 's hand would rest on her knee . Estella would slip her a few more pesos on those nights . Kin nodded , releasing slight streams of smoke . <p> And , Bird went on , Estella helped out when Kin got so sick . She paid for Kin 's hospital stay . She paid , last week , for the dentista who pulled Bird 's bad teeth . <p> " But last night "  --  Bird faced Kin  --  " I was n't trying to pay her back . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old New York edge . Had he been feeling little flares of jealousy over Estella ? <p> " Really . " Bird looked from Kin and his elegantly suspended , barely smoked cigarette to JJ . She wanted them both to understand that it had n't been for money . <p> " So , " Kin murmured , pointing to her with his cigarette as he used to do during their fondue suppers . Their conductor . " What all happened last night ? " <p> Bird fingered her onyx ring . Kin 's gift . " Estella , " she told JJ , " knew Kin was my husband . That 's all she knew . Last night , I told her that Kin and I would have to leave Mexico soon . Move to Texas , find a hospital . " <p> JJ looked at the floor and folded his arms . Impulsively , Bird stepped toward him , trailing her jacket . " So Estella and I , we went on this long last ride . She let me drive  --  a celebration , I was driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JJ 's lap . His knees supported it like tent poles . He stiflened but  --  still  --  kept his face deadpan , eyes downcast . " For protection , " Bird said . She smoothed the leather over his rigid knees . " Case anyone decides to sit on you . " His eyes flicked up to her , a forbidding gray-green . <p> Bird plucked JJ 's sunglasses from his pocket , unfolded them , and slipped them on him . " Case we do anything now you do n't want to see . " <p> JJ reached up as if to take them off but merely adjusted the curved stems around his ears . His pock-scarred face was flushed , as was hers . Half-scared and half-exhilarated by what she was doing , Bird backed away . <p> " So you drove , " Kin said , easing her into the story again . He ground out his cigarette in a seashell . <p> " I drove all the way to Nogales , " Bird went on . " With the roof down . " <p> Estella 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Ai ya , " as they rolled into Nogales , rolled along streets thronged by tourists , by burros painted with zebra stripes , by bouquets of paper flowers huge as bunches of balloons , by streetcarts of lemons and peeled cukes and sweets with beautiful names . The layered pastry they 'd shared was called a bunuelo . <p> Bird hugged herself , remembering the leather and silver-polish smell of the shop where she 'd tried on jacket after jacket . " As a going-away present , Estella bought me just what I wanted . " Bird stepped back to JJ . " Plus coconut oil to protect the leather . " <p> She bent and touched the jacket on JJ 's lap . Daring herself , she rested her hand on JJ 's shoulder as she straightened . Through the cotton , she felt his skin , its surface cool . " Anyhow , " she went on , her voice shaking slightly , " when we got back , I parked her Bonneville behind the dog fence . " JJ 's body was stiffening under her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tentatively , Bird pressed his shoulder . " We sat there awhile under these big bright stars , me in my jacket  --  even in the heat , I wanted it on . And I could 've just driven myself home , said goodbye in her car . But I said to myself : What do I want to do ? " <p> Keeping hold of JJ 's shoulder , she asked herself again that same question . Then bent closer to him . She felt Kin observing them through his lingering smoke . " So I slid out from under the steering wheel , and I climbed into her lap . " <p> Unsteadily , Bird started to ease herself onto JJ 's lap . He gripped her bare arm hard . " No , Bird . " Half-relieved , she pulled away . <p> " Want me to show you ? " she asked Kin . He gave a slow-motion nod and eased himself into a sitting position , propping his pillows upright behind him . His legs stretched in a V over the redstriped sheets . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held it up like a bullfighter 's cape . Kneeling on the bed , she spread it over Kin 's white-clad thighs and crotch . <p> " I sat in her lap , " Bird repeated softly , to Kin . " In my jacket . " She eased down in front of Kin as if they were on a bobsled . Careful not to rest her full weight on him , she settled between his outstretched legs . Leather squeaked beneath her . " She helped me unbutton . Her body was all ... round . Watermelon breasts and a big belly , and at first , Sister Kin , I felt kinda overwhelmed . " Bird settled more heavily against him . " But gradually I sank into all that flesh . All brown and firm , not soft . Before I knew what was happening , I was  --  my first time , y'know  --  sucking her breasts . " Bird leaned fully on Kin as she 'd done during a few long afternoons here , once letting him reach around and feel her breasts as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissing , hard , too . " Bird slowed her words , remembering Estella 's wide tongue filling her mouth , filling the gaps between her teeth . " I took hold of her hand . " Bird groped at her side for Kin 's hand . Light , compared to Estella 's . Drawing it around her body , she rested Kin 's warm bony hand in her lap . " I eased her hand under my skirt ... " <p> " Bueno , bueno , " Kin said , his smoky breath in her hair . Bird shut her eyes , unable to describe how delicately Estella 's strong fingers had separated her vaginal lips . Like flesh petals . How Estella 's fingertips held traces of the bunuelo they 'd shared , its oil and flour and powdered sugar . <p> " Just a touch , " Bird whispered only to Kin , her eyes shut . " But she knew  --  " Bird pressed her hand over Kin 's in her lap . " Just where . " <p> She blinked open her eyes . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his locked jaw . His lips were tightly sealed . But his face had reddened . <p> " My first time ever with a woman , " she said to JJ . " And the first time in years , first time since you , I 've enjoyed anything like that . " <p> Lit by the sun , JJ 's hair shimmered with reddish browns . Steadily behind his glasses , he studied Bird and half-hidden Kin . <p> " I 've let men kiss and touch me . All my Would-Be Lovers . But never  --  " Bird was the one to lower her eyes . " Never like you , Jimmy Joe . " <p> " Nunca . " Kin propped his chin on Bird 's bare shoulder . JJ leaned forward , his forearms resting on his knees again , his hands re-clasped . His expression seemed even more closed , sunglasses still in place . <p> " So . " Bird stretched her legs . She leveled her voice , stating a fact . " We ca n't help it . We keep ... thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Kin asked , his jaw moving against Bird 's shoulder . He was speaking to JJ now , confidentially . Man to man . " You think about us , much ? " <p> JJ swallowed . " Till I got Bird 's letter , I did n't . Much . Did n't let myself . I 'd gotten good at , I do n't know . Control . In some good ways , I think . " He swallowed again . " But once I started , I could n't stop . Thinking of you two . " <p> Bird nodded , feeling her hair brush Kin 's . " We never could get very far alone , Sister Kin and me . " She kept leaning back . In the dim silken Comm . Ave . apartment , she used to lean on Kin , spreading her thighs for JJ . <p> Slowly now , she let her knees loll open . Even with her jeans on , the gesture made her feel bold . She breathed the faint rotted-fish smell under Kin 's perfume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old longing . Not for Kin stroking her while JJ entered her . No , she was distracted now , worried about leaning on Kin too hard . Her heart knotted up as JJ stared , its ache stronger than the slight moist ache between her legs . <p> Ceremonially slow , JJ pulled off his sunglasses . He folded them . He gave Kin and Bird his heavy-lidded stare . " Bird , I ca n't . " He shook his head , his face more darkly reddened . " My wife back in Phoenix . You know . I ca n't do that now , to you . Ca n't do it . " <p> Bird cupped her knees . " Yeah , I know , " she said . Behind her , Kin exhaled as if he 'd known , all along . She eased forward to relieve his tense , frail body . <p> Kin cleared his throat to speak . He 'd always been the calm one , the one who relaxed Bird and JJ their first times together . " Jimmy Joe , Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to ... force anything . " A cough erupted inside him , but Bird felt him swallow it back , hard . " Not with every-thing  --  all of us  --  so changed . Especially me . I know we ca n't do like we used to ... " <p> " But still . " Bird drew her knees closed . Kin 's hand slipped out of her lap . She stood up by the bed as Kin let loose his rumbling cough . Then she stepped over to JJ , who sank low in the butterfly chair . Unmistakably , his bony face was heated like hers . His lips had taken on their old color . " Still , Jimmy Joe . " Bird struggled to keep her own voice calm . " I feel like there ... might be something we could do . Not you and me . That 's not it now , you know ? " She waited a beat , and he raised his eyes . He nodded as if sensing this might 've been the point of her story about Estella . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bird went on , remembering that letter herself . " You read it . You knew coming down here I wanted to try ... something  --  " <p> " For Kin , " JJ said and looked past her at Kin on the bed . Impassively , . Kin met JJ 's stare . His black eyes formed the only slashes of color in his face . He did n't blink . <p> " In her letter , " JJ told Kin , studying him , " she said ... lately you felt . In bursts . All your senses overcharged ? " <p> Kin gave a slow matter-of-fact nod . " Comes and goes in waves , " he said . " Like my fear . " He switched to a mock-teacherly tone , another persona that dated back to the old days . " It 's an ex-perience , boys and girls . And you know I 'm a glutton for experience . " He dropped the voice . " The best part is how sometimes some things  --  just smoking or playing guitar chords or smelling mint-feel all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He squinted at them as if they gave off light . His jaw made the chewing motion that Bird knew meant he could n't speak . He dipped a hand into his ice bag . Shutting his eyes abruptly , he ran a piece of ice over his face . It washed off the powder that hid his lesion , revealing a purple deeper than a mere bruise . <p> " What I fucking need is a cold shower . " Kin reverted now to his Southern Belle voice . " ' S all too much ex-citement for my delicate condition . " He wiped his face with one slow sweeping motion , then lowered his hand . <p> JJ bent more sharply forward . " You still have ... I mean you always have that  --  " He gestured to Kin 's limp , slender hand . " Grace . " <p> Kin still did n't blink . Bird drew a breath , half-hopeful and halfafraid she was going to see him cry . Even when he 'd first found out he 'd tested positive , he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She whispered , " If we could even just lie down together . Just now , once more . " Her whisper seemed to her disembodied , a voice from the room 's shadows . " You do n't have to do anything , Jimmy Joe . Except lie there , maybe , between us . " His eyes flicked up . " It 'd be safe , I swear . There 's nothing dangerous in , you know , sweat . " <p> JJ blinked , his face opening but his jaw still clenched . Bird raised one hand to him as if to shake his hand . The knot in her chest tightened . She found herself longing for the twenty-year-old Jimmy Joe . Shy like her , yet bold , too . <p> " See , " she said to him , suddenly inspired , " my jacket , that leather . It 'll protect us . " JJ studied her outstretched hand as if unsure what it was . Bird bent down to his ear . She whispered , " You 're the only one who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face . " I know . " He said this flatly . As if it were the one thing in his life he was certain about . <p> Slowly , maybe experimentally , he took her hand . She did n't tug . He pulled himself up . She let go of his hand , remembering Jimmy Joe gazing at Kin that first night , no longer asking why she 'd insisted Kin come along , young Jimmy Joe 's eyes burning with a kind of fascination . She 'd seen a flicker of it when he 'd watched Kin smoke minutes before . Now , his gaze seemed lit by something stronger . His eyes shone with a liquid that looked thicker than tears . <p> " Do n't , " Kin said to JJ from the bed . " Do n't do anything you do n't want to do , love . " <p> What Sister Kin always told them , Bird thought , turning . She felt sure JJ was remembering that , too . The single rule of their old game . <p> " I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking his vow . <p> As she had never done years before , Bird led JJ . Together , they stepped away from the butterfly chair and edged between the bed and stucco wall . JJ stopped behind Bird . She froze , wondering what next . JJ moved first . He sat on the mattress to pull off his black sneakers . Then he stood again . Kin on the bed eased his body sideways . <p> JJ lowered himself onto his knees , the mattress sinking under his weight , springs squeaking . Bird touched his shoulder . And he touched Kin 's shoulder . One light touch , one nod . Hello , they seemed to be saying at last . <p> Bird breathed JJ 's sweat , the welcome smell of healthy flesh . " If we can all just ... lie down here ... " Her voice faltered . " In ... a row. ? " <p> Deliberately , JJ rolled onto his side . Bird touched his rib cage , more padded with flesh than before . But his hipbones still jutted out , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched between JJ 's long curved back and Kin , who sat propped against his pillow as if weighted in place by the jacket on his lap . <p> Bird heard the buzzing flies and the sun outside , its hum as it beat down harder . Time was running short , the limited time they could spend together again . But did n't she already feel a charge in the air among their bodies ? Tentatively , Kin shifted his weight , trying to hold the jacket on his lap . <p> " Let me . " Bird edged around the bed , sensing what Kin might want . <p> She rested her hand on Kin 's shirt , his rib cage . Padded by the thinnest skin . Her fingers pressed between his ribs as she helped him roll on his side , the jacket sliding off his lap . Bird took its empty arms . " Wait now . " <p> She held up the unlined jacket . Then remembered Estella 's test last night : how droplets of water had sunk into the leather . Leather is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jacket , wondering what could wholly protect them . She had n't thought of buying condoms , was n't even sure Kin would be able to get erect . She blinked over at Kin 's ice bag , then stepped quickly around the bed . She lifted the bag , dumped its remaining ice into the trash basket . " Kin calls this the Buddhist brand . " She smoothed the airtight plastic to warm it , reading its label . " ' Clear Pure Ice . ' " <p> " Oh , right , " Kin said to JJ , his ragged voice sounding somehow reassured . " This Buddhist book I read for fun . Tells how to reach the State of Not-Self . A clear state , they say . Clear , pure . " <p> " Right . " Bird draped the plastic bag over Kin 's crotch . She lifted the jacket again and tied its creaking leather arms around Kin 's waist . The jacket over the plastic covered Kin 's crotch and thighs like an apron . A smithy apron , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to view her work . The unlined leather was thin enough to let Kin feel the body in front of him . Which was what Kin wanted , Bird felt sure . To feel JJ close to him now . To feel her close , too . <p> JJ propped himself on one elbow , twisting around to face them . " I had to work my leather in here somehow , " Bird said . Kin smiled , curled on his side , his legs bent under the jacket . JJ rested his head again on the bed 's second pillow , his back to Kin . His long body poised . <p> Bird kicked off her sandals . She had read Kin 's Buddhist book , too . It compared its series of meditations to the process of refining gold from ore . How the first stages were bound to be  --  in the book 's curious word  --  gross . Straightening , she touched the knot of Kin 's jacket apron , making sure it would hold . The early stages were gross , the end result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The State of Not-Self , " Kin repeated , musing over the words . " Such a bad translation . " He coughed , but softly . As Bird padded barefoot around the bed , Kin 's voice took on his familiar , gently mocking tone . " I only know one way to reach any such state , Jimmy Joe . Remember ? We used to call it going , not coming . All your desires , even your body itself . Just ... gone . " <p> Bird stopped in front of JJ . She was wedged between the bed and wall . <p> " I remember , " JJ whispered , almost too quietly to be heard . <p> " Course it only lasts a moment or so , " Kin went on , sounding almost sleepy . <p> " But what does n't ? " Bird asked , her voice softened , too . <p> " Nada , " Kin answered . " Like the book tells us . It all depends on what you mean by a ' moment .

" Like the summer we were together , " she whispered , curling herself at the edge , her back to JJ . The three of them lay in a row . " Only a few months , but it 's lasted and lasted . Inside Kin and me , anyhow . " <p> " And me , " JJ added , his breath hot in her hair . <p> " We always remembered , " she dared to go on . " How the three of us , together , always had this ... " <p> " Grace , " JJ said . <p> In answer , Bird moved back close enough so that JJ 's zippered crotch brushed her ass . Then she heard and felt Kin inch closer to JJ from his side , the mattress springs squealing and the jacket creaking . Under it all , the plastic crackled . Kin was pressing his crotch through the leather against JJ 's ass . <p> Bird began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many layers of protection needed now to do what used to be simple . Natural . She rocked harder , feeling Kin rock , too . The mattress springs sounded strange , new . Always before , they had lain together on a springless futon . Bird breathed leather and smoke and sweat , all stronger than the sickly perfumed smell of Kin 's body . Not fish , Bird thought now , inhaling . But oysters , rotted oysters . Behind her , JJ 's body stiffened . Could he detect that smell ? Or was he thinking of the wife Bird had never seen ? His Alice . <p> " C'm on , " Bird murmured , trying not to sound anxious . She rolled around onto her other side . Then she giggled into JJ 's solemn , intently expectant face , much older than Jimmy Joe 's . A computer programmer 's face now .

This has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand by her own serious stare . It has to work . <p> Chastely , she kissed JJ on his flat bristled cheek . " Swans , " she said , half shutting her eyes .

A sound deep in his throat like the purr in a cat . She pressed her throat harder against his and opened her eyes to meet , sideways over JJ 's broad shoulder , Kin 's upraised eyes . <p> " Swans , " she whispered down to Kin . Kin shut his eyes prayerfully hard . He bowed his head . Bird watched him ease forward a last few creaking inches and rest his forehead between JJ 's large , beautifully tensed shoulder blades . <p> JJ gave a low gasp , as if remembering something long forgotten .

" How Kin showed us both what to do ? " Slowly , so he could stop her if he wanted , she reached down to his waist . <p> " I promise , " she whispered as she unsnapped his pants . He tensed his bent legs , but held his body still for her . " We 'll stay safe , Jimmy Joe .

But Sister Kin guided me , my hands ? " <p> She rested Kin 's palm on JJ 's abdomen . His shirttails half hid his mass of brown pubic hair , his velvety purplish balls , his shadowed cock  --  a dusky reddish-pink , thick at its base .

" Why ? " <p> She shrugged one bare shoulder . " There was n't ever anyone else we both , Kin and I ... <p> " JJ nodded . <p> She began to hum . Kin 's leather and plastic apron creaked and crackled as he pressed closer to JJ . She eased his hand down , her own curved thumb brushing JJ 's cock , its warmth and grainy texture deeply familiar . Kin gave the throaty moan Bird had n't heard for eight years . Only with JJ had they been able to share this , too . Under her hand , Kin 's hand held JJ 's cock . With his own lowerpitched moan , JJ began rocking to Bird 's low hum . <p> And she embraced JJ , her breasts pressing against his chest . He shut his eyes again . Kin had begun to pump JJ 's cock . Still humming , her hum vibrating in her outstretched throat , Bird kissed JJ . His mouth warmed hers , but he kept his lips closed . <p> As she pulled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled her mouth , filled all its holes , she 'd felt she knew the answer . Why we were here . She took hold of JJ 's solid shoulders , feeling Kin 's knuckles brush her crotch , imagining Kin 's voice . To fill each other 's holes , love . <p> Kin moaned again . Bird 's fingers sank into JJ 's firm flesh . All skin , Bird thought . Full of pores , holes . Kin 's hand was pumping up and down between her and JJ , warming them both . Could Kin reach that moment he wanted ? Bird braced her own body . Moments of purified awareness ; that was how Kin 's book defined Buddhism . A stream of such moments leading to a Perfect Emptiness . She held her breath . Through vibrations in JJ 's body , she felt Kin 's hips moving . He was breathing hard , like a runner who knows just where he 's going . JJ , too , was breathing hard , his eyes shut tighter , the skin about them rayed with new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips . Bird had stopped humming , but she was still hearing her hum . She shut her eyes , the three of them sharing a smoke-tinged silence . A chapel full of candles , everybody praying . <p> Please , she was saying inside , gripping JJ 's arms . The muscle under the meat . She squeezed , holding JJ steady as Kin pressed him harder from behind . Bird 's heartbeat speeded with Kin 's rough breaths and the singing springs , the shuddery mattress . Please , please . The words beat with thumps of her pulse . Please let Kin come . <p> Leather creaked , suddenly louder than the springs . " Go , " Kin breathed hoarsely from the other side of JJ . <p> JJ sucked in a harsh-sounding breath . Bird gasped , too , tasting JJ 's sweat , losing hold of JJ 's arms as his big hips jolted forward . His hipbones swallowed hers . His chest flattened her breasts , her nipples prickling . Between her legs , Kin 's hand slipped away , replaced by the bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through her denim . <p> " Oh  --  " JJ gasped . Suddenly he 'd wrapped his arms around Bird , his hands cupping her ass . As JJ held and rocked her , as heat spread inside her own skin , Bird gripped Kin 's hands , his arm wedged now under JJ 's rocking side . His palm coated with JJ 's semen , warm and milky between them . <p> With strength she did n't think he had , strength he had n't had minutes before , Kin pulled Bird toward him through JJ . Their arms bent ; their bodies strained . Her onyx ring dug into their interlocked fingers . Bird felt Kin grind against JJ 's haunches , the leather and plastic crackling together . Blacksmith fire , she thought : hot enough to meld solid metal , to separate from gross ore purest gold . <p> JJ 's Adam 's apple bobbed ; Bird opened her mouth and closed her lips around his throat , his bristly sweaty skin . Sucking so hard her teeth ached , she tightened her hold on Kin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , gasping with a sharp inhale like silk torn . <p> Through JJ , Bird felt Kin 's body convulse , her lips fastened to JJ 's throat . Her body remembered what she 'd felt last night , what she 'd felt years before with JJ and Kin , what she felt Kin feel now : veins filled with air , flesh buoyant . Not coming but going , taking off . <p> <p> By ELIZABETH SEARLE <p>
