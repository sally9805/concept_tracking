Gene watches Krista approach Eleanor Grant and whisper in her ear . Krista taps her watch for emphasis . Eleanor Grant nods . &nbsp; GENE WATSONI 'm just trying to get close to her . &nbsp; MR . SMITHHow close do you have to get ? &nbsp; GENE WATSONPretty close . I 've never used a gun before . Eleanor Grant and her entourage leave the platform and go back into the hotel . Krista Brooks hangs back , speaking into a portable phone . Then she , too , disappears into the hotel . &nbsp; MR . SMITHYou blew it again , Mister . What do you mean you 've never used a gun ? &nbsp; GENE WATSONI do n't like ' em . &nbsp; MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  43  --  &nbsp; GENE WATSONYes . &nbsp; MR . SMITHWell , look where it 's got you . Gene looks at his watch . 12:48 . Gene walks over to the bar that 's been set up against one wall and gets a soda and sits in a deck chair . LEW WOLFE , that 's what the press ID says , plops down next to Gene and pulls out a mini-recorder . &nbsp; WOLFEOnce in Chinatown , Governor Eleanor Samara Grant was taken to task one more time for not having a particular minority group on her staff . And she dutifully promised to rectify that omission if re-elected . If this continues the Governor 's office is going to look like the United Nations  --  and why not , with the changing complexion of the state population . Change " complexion " to " configuration " . Somebody will , inevitably , take offense . Wolfe notices Gene in the next chair . &nbsp; WOLFEWho you with ? I do n't see any press credentials , not that it makes you less of a person in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WATSONI 'm not with the press . &nbsp; WOLFEOne of Eleanor Grant 's minions ? &nbsp; GENE WATSONI 'm just a regular citizen .  --  44  --  &nbsp; WOLFEA regular citizen ? Non-existent . We 're a nation of two hundred forty million special interest groups . &nbsp; GENE WATSONWell , I 'm just a regular guy . Gene looks across at Mr. Smith , who stands nearby . &nbsp; GENE WATSONOne of those ordinary people who obey the law , feel bad when they go through a red light . Hell , I even get a little hinky when a policeman pulls up behind me . Gene is talking for Mr. Smith 's benefit . &nbsp; GENE WATSONBut just because I play by the rules does n't mean I 'm somehow deficient in the " gonad " department . Just because I 've never fired a gun does n't mean I 'm a coward or weak . Or stupid . Wolfe looks at Gene , confused by the diatribe . Who the hell has he sat next to ? &nbsp; GENE WATSONI 've built a business from nothing but brains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have neglected some things . . . and I have some regrets . . . one of which I ca n't ever fix . . .

That 's always been my greatest strength . . . and my weakness , I suppose . Nothing can stop me . Do n't underestimate the regular guy .  --  45  --  And Gene , his speech done , gets up , looks at his watch again . 12:51 . Mr. Smith is pissed  --  and a little worried . Wolfe is perplexed , but perhaps interested . He clicks on his mini-recorder . &nbsp; WOLFEFor tomorrow 's column .

Huey notices Gene . &nbsp; HUEYLook at it . My city . &nbsp; GENE WATSONCity ? &nbsp; HUEYYep , a city . My city . I 'm the unofficial Mayor  --  self-appointed .

Nobody 's died from eating at the restaurants  --  yet . Huey laughs . Irene goes by with her cleaning cart . She calls out a greeting to Huey , who grins and raises his Coke cup to her . &nbsp; HUEYSweet Irene . &nbsp; GENE WATSONI used to shine shoes . &nbsp; HUEYYeah ? Not just your own ? &nbsp; GENE WATSONI worked in a barber shop when I was in Junior High . Fifty cents a pair . Used to always get polish on white socks .  --  47  --  &nbsp; HUEYI still do that . Hate white socks . One thing shining shoes teaches you  --  you spend so much time at peoples feet you tend to not look down at another man again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daddy .

Gene looks around for Mr. Smith . Mr. Smith is sipping his coffee , keeping an eye on Gene . Mr. Smith sees something in Gene 's expression and , frowning , heads toward Gene . &nbsp; GENE WATSONExcuse me .

Gene is still worried , but takes some comfort in Krista 's reassurance . The Service Elevator stops suddenly , startling Gene . The doors open . Gene gets out quickly , nervous . Krista exits the elevator , calmer , in control . INT . SERVICE CORRIDOR - 25TH FLOOR , DAY Krista leads Gene past the air conditioning maintenance area , down the service corridor . The corridor is full of vacuum cleaners , cleaning carts , shelves of toilet paper and soap . Krista opens the fire door to the 25th Floor public hallway . Gene slips quickly past her . INT . 25TH FLOOR , DAY Gene hurries down the hall ahead of Krista , checking the room numbers . He 's going the wrong way ! Krista waits for him at the other end . &nbsp; KRISTAThis way . Calm down . It 's all going to work out . Gene changes direction , runs back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2503 . She has a door key . Gene tries to control his breathing and his building panic .

The door opens and into the room walks  --  Mr. Smith ! His eyes sweep past Gene to Brendan Grant . &nbsp; MR . SMITHYou wanted me , boss ? Brendan Grant just shakes his head at Mr. Smith who , embarrassed , turns back to Gene . Mr. Smith glares at Gene . &nbsp; MR .
