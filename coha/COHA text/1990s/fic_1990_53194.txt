We 're mining a vein of blue clay under the red dusty Texas topsoil , squaring up a ditch the backhoe left too rough and ca n't get back to . We slice at the walls with the sides of our shovels and peel up from the bottom long curls of clay that twist away like orange rind . <p> " The sky 's coming up black , " Chick says , and I say , " I know , " and stand up in the narrow space and lean on my shovel . The storm front is coming , a big curve of pencil-colored cloud . It 's October , the time of year when anything can happen . " Be here soon , " Chick says , hoping it will be here sooner , I figure , so he can lay the shovel down and go into the job trailer and play cards . I nod , look up again , and then bend over my digging . <p> Chick wipes sweat he does n't have from his forehead , giving the storm time to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shovel . There 's two hundred feet of open ditch waiting for pipe , and Chick  --  more so than anybody else  --  since he is only as slow as his wages , and steady in hard heat and good to have around in tricky situations . He nods at me , and carves an S shape in the ditch . <p> The earth is n't always solid and pressed together  --  although that 's mostly true ; there are hollows and middens and tangles of unsuspected things underneath , like the small junkyard you 'll sometimes find in the . heart of brambles . I 've seen a backhoe slice through a nest of ground bees eight feet down and pull up the rotten , swarmy tree they 'd settled in , and I watched once as a paper-thin slab of mica ripped loose from clay much like this and , glittering , broke apart in a shower of gold-and-purple flakes in the sun . That metallic rain 's stayed with me . I 'm only a little surprised , then , when Chick digs into a gravel pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned up maybe forty . I 'm patient with says , " Gravel . " <p> It spills into the ditch like marbles . " Careful , " I say . A carload of it could be packed behind the clay wall and we 'd be the rest of our lives humping it out . <p> " Careful " is the wrong thing to say . Chick drops his shovel immediately and lights a cigarette , and then hunches down on his heels to smoke it . The afternoon sun catches the top of his head and makes his black hair glint blue . Hair , clay , and smoke all for a moment are the same color , and then a wind blows up like a hand and restores the natural order . <p> " Are you going to outwait it ? " <p> He nods . <p> " If there 's a man that can outwait gravel , " I say , " it 's you . " <p> He points his cigarette at the sky . " Outwaiting that , " he says . <p> Chick must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with storm water . Clay does n't drain . " This 'll be a swimming pool , " I say . <p> He considers that , and shrugs . He smokes the cigarette down to his fingers and tosses the butt into the ditch to burn out . The first of the rain falls in a cold gust as he picks up his shovel . He smiles at me , vaults out of the low ditch , and runs for the trailer . <p> I pick up his shovel and mine and follow him . Work has stopped everywhere . Carpenters are running for their trucks . Two twelve-year-old Mexican kids are wrestling sheets of plastic over the lumber stacks . The wind fills one sheet like a sail and lifts a boy a couple of inches , but he gets his footing back and pegs the plastic down with a rock . <p> The light drops so quickly I 'm blind for a second , and the temperature drops ten degrees . It 's a Blue Norther . These arctic fronts sometimes sweep down from the Pole , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Magnetic North and Texas to slow them down . High lightning flickers without thunder . It wo n't deliver much rain ; Blue Northers are dry until they hit Gulf air . <p> When I get to the trailer it 's crowded , and the first poker pot is being pulled in . The super 's desk has been cleared of the work clutter of plans and papers  --  even the phone  --  and a blanket has been laid down , and cards , and money . Chick peeks at the corners of his new hand and then squares the cards in front of him , waiting to bet . He has no guile . <p> " Want a hand ? " the super asks me . <p> " In a bit . " There 's a predictable attrition in job trailer poker games , and I like to wait it out . Fifteen or two dozen players begin it with a two- or five-dollar limit , playing  --  necessarily  --  three-card games like guts or monte or acey-deucey . Four or five players lose their beer money and fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the survivors begin dealing in-and-out with a draw , and then four or five more players go away without their money . That takes twenty or thirty minutes and while that 's going on I pour a cup of coffee and look out at the storm . <p> There 's thunder , now , still high up and very thin , but the wind of it down here rocks the trailer . The few cars I can see have their lights on . It 's three-thirty and nearly dark . The rain starts to come down steady , a surprise . <p> Somebody goes past me out the door  --  the first to be fleeced . The door bangs shut , and then open , and the wind grabs it and pins it to the trailer wall . <p> " Jesus , pull it closed . " <p> It ca n't be more than sixty degrees out . <p> " It 's dropped twenty degrees , " I say . <p> " More like thirty , " the super says . Tell him the world will end tomorrow and he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I station myself at the door , a volunteer handle-puller . " This is fast , even for you guys , " I say , and the super grins at me over his beer . " Fools and their money , " he says . <p> " Loan me twenty ? " Chick asks . <p> I consider it . He never does well in these games , and I wish he would n't play them . I take his money , too , when I get a chance , but the rest of them take a special pleasure in it . It 's not the money I want to keep him from losing . I shake my head . <p> " Twenty for twenty-five ? " he asks . <p> I shake my head again . <p> " Twenty for thirty ? Pay you tomorrow . " <p> " No . " <p> " I 'll loan you twenty for forty , " the super says , and C , hick looks from him over to me and I shake my head a third time , about to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I get the words out . <p> " You ought to be ashamed of yourself , " I say . <p> " Well , I would be , " the super says , " ' cept if I win , I win sixty , and if I lose , I win twenty , and that 's good management . " <p> I do the math and do n't get the same numbers , but I understand him . I lean over Chick . " Play the nuts , ' I tell him . " Sit tight until you 've got the nuts . " <p> He raises the first bet and I turn away , disgusted , but he surprises everybody and wins the hand . Two more get up , and the stayers spread out a bit and put their elbows on the table . I get a refill on the coffee and take beers in to those who want them . I stand behind Chick , and after thirty seconds or so he pulls his hand up so I can see it . Ace , king , nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Monte . " <p> " High , or low ? " <p> " High . One draw . " <p> Chick calls a ten-dollar bet . I want to wince. but do n't . <p> " One , " Chick tells the dealer , and throws the nine in . He looks at the new card like it was a snake under a flat rock , and I do n't see it , but he raises the next bet so I know he caught a king or an ace . " Kings , " he says , turning the hand over . He takes the pot , and another player falls away . <p> " Ready yet ? " the super asks . <p> I shake my head . Two of the ten players are teetering , and I 'm enjoying watching Chick make dumb moves and get away with them . I want him to have a handful of money before I sit down to take it away from him . I can do it without him feeling beaten . <p> " Same game , deuces wild . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street ? " I ask . <p> " No streets , " the super says . He looks at Chick and says , " I 'm going to beat you like a redheaded stepchild , " and the two of them grin at each other , the bully and the bullied . <p> Chick shows me a pair of twos , raises the pot , throws away the kicker  --  a seven  --  and does n't even look at the replacement . He 's got three of something , with those wild twos , and that will win . <p> When he pulls in the pot he pays the super back his forty dollars and leans back , smug . " You could have made money , " he says to me . <p> " I do n't like monte , " I say . " I 'll wait for the skill games . <p> " I did n't mean by playing monte . I meant by betting on me . " <p> " I know . Wait till the skill games . " <p> " This is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Before I 've finished the coffee , the table 's down to seven players . I look at my watch : twenty-five minutes . " Deal me in , " I say , and take the seat next to Chick . <p> Chick , to my surprise , and the super 's  --  and probably even to Chick 's  --  shows patience in the draw and stud games , and some caution , and not a small amount of good sense . He begins winning at a slow and steady rate . He folds if he ca n't beat openers before the draw . He lets an open ace scare him if he has n't seen any others . He stops assuming , for this one heady night , that everybody is bluffing . <p> It 's around midnight when I have another good hand against him . A flush . I watch his fingers square his money , tuck his cards under the green brick , bring a cigarette up from his shirt pocket , strike a match hot . He has white scars on his knuckles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle finger . I look up into his dark eyes and see no deception . No triumph , either . He grins at me in a friendly , we-share-the-ditch sort of way and I want to reach out and tousle his black hair as I would a little brother 's , but instead I reach into my own money and pull out enough to call . I should raise him , but I do n't . " Full house , " Chick says , and rakes in the pot before he sees my cards . <p> The game ends a little bit later with me owing Chick a hundred and fifty dollars . I write an IOU on the ace of spades and sign it , and he tucks it into his wallet along with his other winnings . <p> " That ditch is going to be an awful small place , now , " the super says , and I smile tiredly , knowing Chick better than the super does , but not knowing him well enough to know if he 's right . <p> Chick raises a hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . It could have been directed at either of us , but I 'm the one who waves back , ruefully , wondering how I 'll explain a loss that size to my wife . Chick goes out , and it 's cold . <p> " Jesus , " the super says . " It 's snowing . " <p> It snows in Texas , even here around Dallas , but not in October . I watch with the super at the door as Chick ducks through big dry flakes to his car . The ground is shiny , but not white . <p> " Cold day in hell , " the super says , and laughs . <p> " Win anything ? " I ask . <p> " Fifty-something . " <p> " Got anything socked away to warm us up in a blizzard ? " <p> " Sure . " He sits at his desk and pulls a bottle from the top drawer and puts his feet up . " So you owe your tailman some of your paycheck . " <p> I nod , as surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's that ? " <p> " You owe your spic tailman some of your paycheck . " He takes the bottle back from me and swirls the clear liquid in it , holding it up to the light as if he expects to see something floating . He shakes his head . " I 'd cut my own throat with this bottleneck before I 'd owe a Mex . " <p> " He held up the sides of a ditch , once , while I climbed out , " I say , liking the super less , and then , suddenly , not liking him at all . <p> " Big deal . " <p> The clay sometimes calves five-hundred-pound slabs that can snap a man 's legs like sticks , and that is a big deal , to me , but I do n't say anything . I wave the offered bottled away and stand up . " I 've got enough in me , " I say . <p> " You must have pulled him out , " the super says . <p> " Sure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . " <p> " Then you 're even . " <p> " The point is , I already owe him ; the hundred and a half is nothing . " <p> The super wipes the bottle off , caps it , and puts it back in his drawer . " How long are you going to be on that storm ditch ? " <p> " Day and a half . " <p> " Closed up ? " <p> " Digging it . We should have it laid by the end of the week , " I say . " Backfilling it is something else . " I picture the hoe operator  --  Wilkens  --  and think of all the ways he can screw it up . <p> " Want the hundred and fifty to pay Chick off ? " The super moves a hand to his hip , ready to pull his wallet out on the draw . <p> " What 'll it cost ? " <p> He smiles . " Just the hundred and fifty . White money . " <p> " You ever think he hates you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " Sure . What the hell do you think ? But he can hate me all he wants and it wo n't get him anywhere . " <p> That 's God 's own truth . I go to the door and down the steps . The snow has stopped , but the dirt crunches like gravel in a frost . <p> " Drive careful , " the super says , and I nod and wave and get into my truck . Before I start it , I wonder if the heater works . <p> It might have been the rain , but it was probably the cold that collapsed the ditch . Cold cracks things open . I know it 's going to take most of a hard day 's work for the two of us to clear it . <p> Chick comes up and stands quietly beside me . <p> " Good game last night , " I say . <p> He nods . <p> " I mean you . You played a good game . " <p> " Thanks . " <p> " I 'll have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at me . I think for a minute that I have upset a delicate spring in him somewhere , but he grins and says , " Okay . " <p> Now this , I think , and look back at the ditch . The clay has toppled in where we 'd been digging . In the cave it left is a run of gravel . <p> " Take all day , " Chick says . <p> " Most of it . " <p> " Get the hoe back here ? " <p> " That would be the smart thing . " <p> " Set it up on this side and side-dig it , " he says , explaining it to me . I do n't smile or stop him because this is the first time he 's shown any sort of interest in how to get a job done . " ' Course , if it 's Wilkens , tell him to set up on the other side , and maybe he 'll fall in . " <p> " Yeah , right . Come on in the trailer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I 'll wait out here . " <p> He 's got his hands dug into the pockets of a thin jacket . <p> " Cup of hot coffee ? " <p> " If you bring it out . " <p> " How many pounds of sugar ? " <p> He grins at me with perfect teeth . When he 's thirty , they 'll all fall out at once . <p> I call the boss and explain the damage , and he says he 'll try to get a hoe free but to go ahead and start on it with shovels . I know what that means . I pour two cups of coffee and take enough sugar out with me to put a diabetic ward in a coma . The super , I think happily , is out supering . <p> I tell Chick the bad news but he does n't blink . He takes the coffee with both hands , and says , " Okay . " That 's quite a change for Chick , and I think he must have discovered he has Aztec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's stupid to do this with shovels , " I say . <p> " Yeah . " He drops the sugar in and does n't stir it . " What else have we got to do ? " <p> " Nothing 's going to make this a bad day , is it ? " <p> He pretends to think about it . " Nope . " <p> We finish the coffee and still neither of us climbs down to get to work . " We have to get the pipe laid by the end of the week , " I say , and point , stupidly , to the lengths of 48 " aluminum storm pipe strung along the spoil pile . Wilkens had even put the dirt on the wrong side . <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because I said we would . " <p> " That 's not much of a reason , " Chick says . <p> It 's no reason at all . " Pavers are waiting to make this a street . " <p> " Well , when they get tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crowbar up McConlin 's ass and free up a backhoe . " He has a sudden thought , and smiles . " And maybe get Wilkens fired . " <p> We look at each other . " I do n't think so , " I say . <p> " Not a hope , " Chick says . <p> " Ready to get down to it ? " <p> " If you are . " He puts his hand on my arm as I begin to climb down . " Thanks , " he says . <p> " For what ? " <p> He looks at me for a second , and I try to read something in those black eyes , but ca n't . He shrugs and goes down . I watch him stick his shovel into the clay and carve out a piece , and I watch the shovel sweep back in a scything motion and hear the clay come sucking loose . It drops outside the ditch with exactly the same sound a small animal would make , dropped from such a height . <p> By eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging , quit McConlin , quit construction , quit Texas . These wasted man-hours are seven-fifty to McConlin  --  five bucks for Chick  --  but to the two of us , that twelve-fifty is backbreaking , stupid labor and the unfairness of it settles like a weight on my spine . <p> " Lunch , " I say , standing up . <p> " Okay , " Chick says . <p> " And after lunch , " I say , " revolution . " <p> Chick squints at me , studying my face . " If that comes from the heart , " he says , " it is pronounced revo-loosy-own . " <p> " Then after lunch we have a revo-loosy-own . " <p> " A big one , or a small one ? " <p> " There 's just the two of us , Chick . <p> " Mi compadre , " he says , climbing out of the ditch , " we are millions . " <p> We bring our brown bags and water bottles down into the ditch to eat . The clay is cool , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tiny flecks of rust , as if another shovel had been here before ours or little ironlike creatures had died in it . <p> Our water bottles are plastic , one-gallon milk jugs that we fill three-quarters full and put in the freezer overnight . This early in the day there is still a large frozen mass floating in the center and it scrapes eerily inside the plastic , a trapped iceberg . I tip the bottle carefully , so it wo n't rush up and knock me in the teeth . <p> I 'm facing the new cave loaded with gravel , so I look into it , not expecting to find anything but gravel , but the more I look the more I think I see a shape buried in it , as you can see in marble , or in wallpaper , or in dirty tiled floors . Shadow , I think , but I get up anyway and go closer . There is what looks like a braided rope buried in it . <p> " Chick , " I say , not touching it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in front of me and stares at it . " Hmm , " he says . " Armadillo . " <p> " What do you mean , armadillo ? " <p> " Armadillo . How else you going to say it ? " He reaches in and pulls and the whole thing comes out of the gravel bed in a dry clatter like falling dominoes . Chick , grunting , lifts it by its tail with two hands . " Dead , " he says needlessly . <p> It 's the size of a Brittany spaniel . I poke it , and it feels rubbery . " Lay it down . " <p> It 's been dead for a long time , and it 's more an armadillo mummy than an armadillo carcass . Its narrow orange face looks scorched . <p> " Now what ? " Chick asks . <p> " How long do you figure it has to be dead to be in that gravel run ? " <p> Chick worries through the sentence and gets its meaning and says , " A long time . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe . " <p> " It might be worth something . " <p> " Maybe . " <p> " You do n't think so ? " <p> " This revolution 's off to a bad start , " Chick says , and turns away . <p> We finish our lunch and light cigarettes . " Ever run over one of those ? " Chick asks . <p> I say no . <p> " Damn dumb beasts , " he says . " They crawl along the middle of the road until your headlights hit ' em , and then they jump straight up in the air . " He raises his hand . " Knocks the grillwork all to hell . " <p> " I 'll bet . " <p> He shakes his head . " I suppose that 's a good instinct  --  the jumping  --  or was , once , for someplace or other , but on the highway in the middle of the night , it does n't work out so good . " <p> " You kill a lot of them ? " <p> " Two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . ' Course , I did n't have a grill , from the time before . " <p> I think about that for a bit , how there 're still prehistoric things alive with us , and not doing too well . They say there 're Florida crocodiles swimming in the sewers of New York City ; and sharks keep getting pulled up onto fishing boats . They 're hung up by their tails on the dock to have their pictures taken , and then their jaws are pulled out with claw hammers . <p> " What do we do now ? " Chick asks . <p> " We wait . " <p> He lights another cigarette and for a long time does n't say anything . Then he says , " For a minute there , this morning , I thought you would really do something . This is the sort of revolution that governments everywhere want . " <p> " Revo-loosy-own , " I say , but Chick , disenchanted , says nothing . <p> So we wait . I sit for two and a half hours on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the poker game and the money I owe Chick , and trying to work it all out . I am on the edge of a friendship  --  or at least , I was  --  and suddenly that matters very much . Every time you think you know enough , you find out you do n't know anything . <p> Fifteen minutes before quitting time  --  a quarter to four  --  Wilkens pulls up with the dump truck and lowboy and backhoe . He unchains it and drives it down and maneuvers its scorpion shape around to begin digging . The stabilizers settle in and the rear wheels lift off the ground and  --  scoop , scoop , scoop  --  he 's done in five minutes . <p> " I think I 'll get him a shovel , " I tell Chick , " and he can help us with the rest of this ditch tomorrow . " <p> " Give him mine , " Chick says . He looks at me with those black eyes and I think I might be a tree or a rock to him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " <p> He points at Wilkens . <p> " Oh , Chick . Not you , too . " I feel girlish , feminine . Even though I should have suspected this , if not known it , this is a blow . Chick picks up his shovel and water bottle and starts for his car . " Do n't go yet , " I say , and climb out of the ditch and walk over to Wilkens . <p> Wilkens has the backhoe up on the lowboy and is running a chain through the front axle . <p> " How long will it take you to make the rest of this ditch right ? " I ask him . <p> " What are you talking about ? " He holds the chain in both hands , forgetting for a minute what he is doing , and then , remembering , pulls it on through . <p> " You dug that ditch short , " I say , " and we 're not cleaning up your mistakes anymore . This is the third time , and this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looks at his watch . " I 'm off , " he says . " Done for the day . " <p> I step down from the lowboy and take the keys from the dump truck and put them in my pocket . Chick comes up and stands behind me . He 's got his shovel , still , and I 'm glad for both of them . <p> " What is this ? " Wilkens asks . <p> " Revolucion , " Chick says so softly I know Wilkens ca n't hear . <p> " This is you doing your job , " I say . " Either with that "  --  I point at the backhoe  --  " or with a shovel . " <p> I could n't take Wilkens in a fight and both of us know it , but he sees something in Chick 's face that scares him . I can see it appear behind his eyes . He glares for a minute at both of us and then he takes the backhoe off the lowboy and sets up to side-dig the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " he says when he 's finished . <p> " McConlin can go screw himself , " Chick says . <p> " McConlin wo n't have trouble with the super or the pavers , " I say , " and McConlin will like that just fine . " <p> When Wilkens drives off I walk Chick to his car . The grill 's punched out , as he said . He opens the trunk and pulls out a file and begins to put a new edge on his shovel . <p> " We lay pipe in the morning ? " he asks . <p> " Yep . " <p> " Bury that dumb damn armadillo ? " <p> " Yep . " <p> He gets in and starts the engine . He hits the throttle twice , and the front of the car rocks . " Okay , " he says . " And you owe me a hundred and fifty bucks on payday .

I get into my truck and go home , anxious to make love to my wife . When I come through the door and I tell her what 's on my mind , she cocks her head and gives me a little sideways look and a smile and puts the dinner on hold and we go into the bedroom . I have prehistoric things on my mind , and that makes it different  --  maybe better , I do n't know  --  and a shiver runs through me as I think of all that cold air rushing down from the Pole . We lie side by side afterward and I have my hand resting on my own heart . I can feel its steady beating . It 's funny , almost furry  --  this heart that feels like such a solid thing , but is n't . <p> <p> By G. W. Hawkes <p>
