<p> In the fertile valleys of western North Carolina , it 's a scene as old as the Cherokee Indian . <p> Under a pale blue sky , the tobacco leaves have turned gold under the warm late summer sun , and the Barnett family harvests the crop as they have for decades . Sweat soaking their shirts , the men spear tobacco leaves with a stick . When full , each stick weighs about 30 pounds and is ready for hanging in the barn to cure . <p> This is burley tobacco country . The cooler Appalachian Mountains remain a refuge , a last stand of the small tobacco farms that once were common throughout much of the South . Burley tobacco is thin-leaved and milder than the strains that thrive in the hot flatlands of the Carolinas and Georgia . It 's still cured the slower , old-fashioned way , by the cool , dry autumn air that passes through weather-beaten barns . Flatland tobacco is flue-cured , by propane gas heaters , and has a harsher taste . Cigarettes rely on a blend of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see green tobacco patches as small as a quarter acre , just a few steps from the kitchen door . The crop is a throwback to a simpler era , with most of the work still done by hand , from the planting to the bailing of cured leaf . Thousands of families in the burley belt  --  principally the hills of Kentucky , Tennessee and North Carolina  --  have relied on tobacco when other crops have failed . <p> Yet even this vestige of the traditional family farm is endangered , threatened by cheap imports , proposals to do away with government price supports and the moral dilemma of producing a product that is linked to so much sickness and death . <p> Ironically , unlike their ancestors who long toiled these soils for the profitable leaf , not a member of the Barnett clan smokes , dips or chews tobacco . <p> The moral issue is especially apparent for Randy Barnett . <p> At 45 , Barnett is the family 's senior member . He has long grown tobacco and tomatoes to keep the farm going , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is now principal at an elementary school . <p> " Fifteen years ago , people were real proud of their tobacco , " he says . " People would take pride in showing off how pretty their tobacco was . <p> " And now , " he shakes his head . " People think you are like a drug dealer . The kids at school think its a bad thing . " <p> The Barnetts know firsthand of tobacco 's pain . His father , Bill Barnett , was a longtime smoker of Lucky Strikes . He died at 72 of lung cancer . His grandfather , however , chewed and smoked cigars until he died of old age at 94 . Both men grew burley . <p> " I do have mixed emotions about it , " Randy Barnett admits , pausing to wipe his brow and drink deeply from a chilled bottle of water . " But tobacco has always been a good crop for us . It 's really what has kept us farming . " <p> Later in the same water break , wife Clara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded with leaf , says , " I would never encourage someone to smoke . " <p> At the Barnetts ' , a spacious ranch-style home overlooking the red-painted barn , tobacco money has sent a child to college , helped buy new cars and bought loads of Christmas presents . <p> This year , for instance , the Barnetts hope to earn as much as $ 5,000 from their patch of 1 1/2 acres . <p> More than an income supplement , tobacco keeps the family morally grounded on the land and with each other , they say . <p> Since the burley crops are typically small , families usually provide most of their own labor . <p> " It gave us a lot of work ethic and morals as we were growing up , " says Amber Barnett Ledford , 24 , who began working in the patch when she was 4 . " Of course , I hated it when I was a kid . I appreciate it now . " <p> Tobacco sent Amber to Western Carolina University . She now teaches seventh-grade science . With her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she continues to work alongside her mother and father and 15-year-old brother , Aaron . <p> Ever since Congress created the tobacco stabilization program in the 1930s , farmers have been able to bank on tobacco profits . <p> The program established a system of quotas or allotments that limits the amount of tobacco individual farmers can grow . It also set up a loan program that provides money for farmer cooperatives to purchase tobacco when prices are low and then sell it later as prices rebound . <p> While flue-cured tobacco has steadily become concentrated on larger and larger farms  --  some total hundreds of acres  --  burley farms have remained mostly small , less than five acres . <p> Two things have kept the small farmer in the burley business , says Blake Brown , a tobacco policy expert at North Carolina State University . <p> First , burley must be cut and gathered by hand  --  unlike flue-cured , typically harvested by machine . But more importantly , he says , the allotment system has kept prices high enough for even the tiniest patch of burley to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) can not be sold or otherwise transferred across county lines , the system locks in place a network of small farms . <p> " If it was n't for the quotas , there probably would n't be a burley crop in the Appalachians , " says Brown , who grew up on a small tobacco farm in the highlands of North Carolina . <p> " Without the quotas , some farmers would plant fence row to fence row , so to speak , and flood the market with tobacco . Then prices would fall , and only large farmers who can take advantage of the economy of scale would survive . " <p> The fate of the quotas hinges on what Congress does about the proposed $ 368 billion tobacco settlement . The issue appears dead , at least for this session , though a number of key members have vowed to keep pursuing a deal . <p> Thrown into the mix is a proposal to end all federal involvement in tobacco production and compensate farmers with a government buyout of their quotas . For the Barnetts , that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four generations of farming . They quit raising tomatoes a few years back , a crop that was once more profitable than tobacco , when the local tomato packinghouse closed . It was pushed out of business by the megafarms of California , Florida and Mexico . <p> In the late afternoon heat , the sharp odor of curing tobacco hangs thick in the air . With cousin Phillip Rickett and friend Jeff Beaver lending a hand , the men load a trailer with tobacco . Later , Aaron arrives from football practice and joins in the work , as does his sister , Amber . <p> Each load is hung from a framing of two-by-fours that fills the inside of the barn like scaffolding . One man crawls high up the 25-foot barn , while the others pass loads up to him in a process that looks backbreaking . <p> It 's dangerous work that can literally make them sick . If the crop is harvested while wet from rain or dew , the water-soluble nicotine is readily absorbed through the skin , resulting in nicotine poisoning or green tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barnett says . " Nauseous , dizzy , throwing up . It usually lasts 12 to 24 hours . " <p> The family rarely harvests the crop when wet , except in rainy autumns , when it 's nearly impossible to avoid . <p> That 's another reason they feel blessed again this year . The dry weather has made for ideal harvest conditions . <p> " I know tobacco has its drawbacks , " says Ledford , as everyone chats outside the barn in the cool of twilight . " But so does alcohol . Why just pick on tobacco ? Why not pick on alcohol ? <p> " It 's like this : I 'm 29 years old and choose not to drink . But I 'm not trying to outlaw alcohol .
