the last Monday morning of March began with promise in the historic city of Richmond , Virginia , where prominent family names had not changed since the war that was not forgotten . Traffic was scant on downtown streets and the Internet . Drug dealers were asleep , prostitutes tired , drunk drivers sober , pedophiles returning to work , burglar alarms silent , domestic fights on hold . Not much was going on at the morgue . Richmond , built on seven or eight hills , depending on who counts , is a metropolitan center of unflagging pride that traces its roots back to 1607 , when a small band of fortune-hunting English explorers got lost and laid claim to the region by planting a cross in the name of King James . The inevitable settlement at the fall line of the James River , predictably called " The Fails , " suffered the expected tribulations of trading posts and forts , and anti-British sentiments , revolution , hardships , floggings , scalpings , treaties that did n't work and people dying young . Local Indians discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furs for hatchets , ammunition , cloth , kettles and more firewater . Slaves were shipped in from Africa . Thomas Jefferson designed Monticello , the Capitol and the state penitentiary . He founded the University of Virginia , drafted the Declaration of Independence and was accused of fathering mulatto children . Railroads were constructed . The tobacco industry flourished and nobody sued . All in all , life in the genteel city ambled along reasonably well until 1861 , when Virginia decided to secede from the Union and the Union would n't go along with it . Richmond did not fare well in the Civil War . Afterward , the former capital of the Confederacy went on as best it could with no slaves and bad money . It remained fiercely loyal to its defeated cause , still flaunting its battle flag , the Southern Cross , as Richmonders marched into the next century and survived other terrible wars that were not their problem because they were fought elsewhere . By the late twentieth century , things were going rather poorly in the capital city . Its homicide rate had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suffering . Children were carrying guns and knives to school and fighting on the bus . Residents and department stores had abandoned downtown and fled to nearby counties . The tax base was shrinking . City officials and city council members did n't get along . The governor 's antebellum mansion needed new plumbing and wiring . General Assembly delegates continued slamming desktops and insulting one another when they came to town , and the chairman of the House Transportation Committee carried a concealed handgun onto the floor . Dishonest gypsies began dropping by on their migrations north and south , and Richmond became a home away from home for drug dealers traveling along I-95 . The timing was right for a woman to come along and clean house . Or perhaps it was simply that nobody was looking when the city hired its first female police chief , who this moment was out walking her dog . Daffodils and crocuses were blooming , the morning 's first light spreading across the horizon , the temperature an unseasonable seventy degrees . Birds were chatty from the branches of budding trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothed . " Good girl , Popeye , " she encouraged her Boston terrier . It was n't an especially kind name for a dog whose huge eyes bulged and pointed at the walls . But when the SPCA had shown the puppy on TV and Hammer had rushed to the phone to adopt her , Popeye was already Popeye and answered only to that name . Hammer and Popeye kept a good pace through their restored neighborhood of Church Hill , the city 's original site , quite close to where the English planted their cross . Owner and dog moved briskly past antebellum homes with iron fences and porches , and slate and false mansard roofs , and turrets , stone lintels , chased wood , stained glass , scroll-sawn porches , gables , raised so-called English and picturesque basements , and thick chimneys . They followed East Grace Street to where it ended at an overlook that was the most popular observation point in the city . On one side of the precipice was the radio station WRVA , and on the other was Hammer 's nineteenth-century Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business about the time the Civil War ended . Hammer loved the old brick , the bracketed cornices and flat roof , and the granite porch . She craved places with a past and always chose to live in the heart of the jurisdiction she served . She unlocked the front door , turned off the alarm system , freed Popeye from the leash and put her through a quick circuit of sitting , sitting pretty and getting down , in exchange for treats . Hammer walked into the kitchen for coffee , her ritual every morning the same . After her walk and Popeye 's continuing behavioral modification , Hammer would sit in her living room , scan the paper and look out long windows at the vista of tall office buildings , the Capitol , the Medical College of Virginia and acres of Virginia Commonwealth University 's Biotechnology Research Park . It was said that Richmond was becoming the " City of Science , " a place of enlightenment and thriving health . But as its top law enforcer surveyed edifices and downtown streets , she was all too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viaducts , and abandoned factories and tobacco warehouses with windows painted over and boarded up . She knew that bordering downtown and not so far from where she lived were five federal housing projects , with two more on Southside . If one told the politically incorrect truth , all were breeding grounds for social chaos and violence and were clear evidence that the Civil War continued to be lost by the South . Hammer gazed out at a city that had invited her to solve its seemingly hopeless problems . The morning was lighting up and she worried there would be one cruel cold snap left over from winter . Would n't that be just like everything else these days , the final petty act , the eradication of what little beauty was left in her horrendously stressful life ? Doubts crowded her thoughts . When she had forged the destiny that had brought her to Richmond , she had refused to entertain the possibility that she had become a fugitive from her own life . Her two sons were grown and had distanced themselves from her long before their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring . Judy Hammer had bravely gone on , gathering her life 's mission around her like a crusader 's cape . She resigned from the Charlotte P.D. , where she had been resisted and celebrated for the miracles she wrought as its chief . She decided it was her calling to move on to other southern cities and occupy and raze and reconstruct . She made a proposal to the National Institute of Justice that would allow her to pick beleaguered police departments across the South , spend a year in each , and bring all of them into a union of one-for-all and all-for-one . Hammer 's philosophy was simple . She did not believe in cops ' rights . She knew for a fact that when officers , the brass , precincts and even chiefs seceded from the department to do their own thing , the result was catastrophic . Crime rates went up . Clearance rates went down . Nobody got along . The citizens that law enforcement was there to protect and serve locked their doors , loaded their guns , cared not for their neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hammer 's blueprint for enlightenment and change was the New York Crime Control Model of policing known as COMSTAT , or computer-driven statistics . The acronym was an easy way to define a concept far more complicated than the notion of using technology to map crime patterns and hot spots in the city . COMSTAT held every cop accountable for everything . No longer could the rank and file and their leaders pass the buck , look the other way , not care , not know the answer , say they could n't help it , were about to get around to it , had n't been told , forgot , meant to , did n't feel well or were on the phone or off duty at the time , because on Mondays and Fridays Chief Hammer assembled representatives from all precincts and divisions and gave them hell . Clearly , Hammer 's battle plan was a northern one , but as fate would have it , when she presented her proposal to Richmond 's city council , it was preoccupied with infighting , mutiny and usurpations . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to let someone else solve the city 's problems . So it was that Hammer was hired as interim chief for a year and allowed to bring along two talents she had worked with in Charlotte . Hammer began her occupation of Richmond . Soon enough stubbornness set in . Hatred followed . The city patriarchs wanted Hammer and her NIJ team to go home . There was not a thing the city needed to learn from New York , and Richmonders would be damned before they followed any example set by the turncoat , carpetbagging city of Charlotte , which had a habit of stealing Richmond 's banks and Fortune 500 companies . deputy Chief Virginia West complained bitterly through painful expressions and exasperated huffs as she jogged around the University of Richmond track . The slate roofs of handsome collegiate Gothic buildings were just beginning to materialize as the sun thought about getting up , and students had yet to venture out except for two young women who were running sprints . " I ca n't go much farther , " West blurted out to Officer Andy Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , " he said . " Then you can walk . " It was the only time she took orders from him . Virginia West had been a deputy chief in Charlotte when Brazil was still going through the police academy and writing articles for the Charlotte Observer . Then Hammer had brought them with her to Richmond so West could head investigations and Brazil could do research , handle public information and start a website . Although one might argue that , in actuality , West and Brazil were peers on Hammer 's NIJ team , in West 's mind she outranked Brazil and always would . She was more powerful . He would never have her experience . She was better on the firing range and in fights . She had killed a suspect once , although she was n't proud of it . Her love affair with Brazil back in their Charlotte days had been due to the very normal intensity of mentoring . So he 'd had a crush and she had gone along with it before he got over it . So what . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those two girls , who are either on the track team or have an eating disorder , " West continued to complain in gasps . " No ! And guess why ! Because this is stupid as shit ! I should be drinking coffee , reading the paper right now . " " If you 'd quit talking , you could get into a rhythm , " said Brazil , who ran without effort in navy Charlotte P.D . sweats and Saucony shoes that whispered when they touched the red rubberized track . " You really ought to quit wearing Charlotte shit , " she went on talking anyway . " It 's bad enough as is . Why make the cops here hate us more ? " " I do n't think they hate us . " Brazil tried to be positive about how unfriendly and unappreciative Richmond cops had been . " Yes they do . " " Nobody likes change , " Brazil reminded her . " You seem to , " she said . It was a veiled reference to the rumor West had heard barely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on with his landlady , a wealthy single woman who lived in Church Hill . West had asked for no further information . She had checked out nothing . She did not want to know . She had refused to drive past Brazil 's house , much less drop by for a visit . " I guess I like change when it 's good , " Brazil was saying . " Exactly . " " Do you wish you 'd stayed in Charlotte ? " " Absolutely . " Brazil picked up his pace just enough to give her his back . She would never forgive him for saying how much he wanted her to come with him to Richmond , for talking her into something yet one more time because he could , because he used words with clarity and conviction . He had carried her away on the rhythm of feelings he clearly no longer had . He had crafted his love into poetry and then fucking read it to someone else . " There 's nothing for me here , " said West , who put words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fences . " I mean let 's be honest about it . " She was n't about to paint over anything without stripping it first . " It sucks . " She sawed away . " Thank God it 's only for a year . " She pounded her point . He replied by picking up his pace . " Like we 're some kind of MASH unit for police departments , " she added . " Who were we kidding ? What a waste of time . I do n't remember when I 've wasted so much time . " Brazil glanced at his watch . He did n't seem to be listening to her , and she wished she could get past his broad shoulders and handsome profile . The early sun rubbed gold into his hair . The two college women sprinted past , sweaty and fat-free , their muscular legs pumping as they showed off to Brazil . West felt depressed . She felt old . She halted and bent over , hands on her knees . " That 's it ! " she exclaimed , heaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place like he was treading water , looking back at her . " Go on . " " You sure ? " " Fly like the wind . " She rudely waved him on . " Damn it , " she bitched as her flip phone vibrated on the waistband of her running shorts . She moved off the track , over to the bleachers , out of the way of hard-bodied people who made her insecure . " West , " she answered . " Virginia ? It 's ... " Hammer 's voice pushed through static . " Chief Hammer ? " West loudly said . " Hello ? " " Virginia ... You there ? " Hammer 's voice scattered more . West pressed a hand over her other ear , trying to hear . " ... That 's bullshit ... " a male voice suddenly broke in . West started walking , trying to get into a better cell . " Virginia ... ? " Hammer 's voice barely crackled through . " ... can do it anytime ... usual rules apply ... " The male voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously a redneck . West felt instant hostility . " ... time to ... kill ... Got to ... or score ... " The redneck spoke in distorted blurts. " ... an ugly dog not worth ... lead to shoot it ... " A second redneck suddenly answered the first redneck . " How much ... ? " " Depends on ... Maybe a couple hundred ... " " ... Just between us ... " " ... If ... body ... finds ... " " ... not invited ... " " What ? " Hammer 's voice surfaced and was gone . " ... Use a ... cold nose ... Not your piece ... shit ... ! Blue ... " " Chief Hammer ... " West started to say more , then caught herself , realizing the rednecks might be able to hear them , too . " ... coons ... " The first redneck came back . " ... not one born too smart for ... Dismal Swamp ... " " ... Got that right , Bubba ... We covered ... a blanket ... " " Okay , Smudge ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she listened to two men plan a homicide that clearly was racially motivated , a hate crime , a score to settle that involved robbery . It sounded as if the murder would go down early in the morning . She wondered if a cold nose was slang for a snub-nosed revolver and if blue referred to a gun that was blue steel versus stainless steel or nickel-plated . Clearly , the psychos planned to wrap the body in a blanket and dump it in the Dismal Swamp . Static . " ... Loraine ... " Bubba 's fractured voice was back . " ... At old pumps ... cut engine ... headlights off so do n't wake ... " Static , and the cell cleared . " Chief Hammer ? " West said . " Chief Hammer ? Are you still there ? " " Bubba ... " the second stranger crackled again . " Somebody 's on ... " Static , scratch , blare , blip . " Goddamn it , " West muttered when her phone went dead . bubba 's real name was Butner Fluck IV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guns , topless bars and the Southern Cross , he had not been born into the tribe of Bubbas , but rather had grown up the son of a theologian in the Northside neighborhood of Ginter Park , where old mansions were in disrepair and Civil War cannonballs on porches were popular . Butner came from a long line of Butners who always went by the nickname " But , " and it was lost on his erudite father , Dr. But Fluck III , that calling his son But in this day and age set the child up for problems . By the time little But had entered the first grade , the slurs , the slander and the derision were on every tongue . They were whispered in class , shouted on buses and playing fields , and drawn on sheets of notebook paper slipped from desk to desk or left inside little But 's locker . When he wrote his name it was But Fluck . In the teacher 's grade books he was Fluck , But . Any way he looked at it , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with any number of other renditions . Mother-But-Flucker , Butter-Flucker , But-Flucking-Boy , Buttock-Fluck , and so on . When he retreated into his studies and went to the head of the class , new pet names were added to the list . But-Head , Fluck-Head , Mother-Flucking-But-Head , Head-But-Head , et al . For But 's ninth birthday he requested camouflage and several toy guns . He became a compulsive eater . He spent a lot of time in the woods hunting imaginary prey . He immersed himself in a growing stash of magazines featuring mercenary soldiers , anarchists , trucks , assault weapons , Civil War battlefields and women in swimsuits . He collected manuals on simple car care and repair , automotive tools and wiring , wilderness survival , fishing , and hiking in bear country . He sneaked cigarettes and was rude . His tenth year he changed his name to Bubba and was feared by all . This early Monday morning Bubba was driving home from third shift at Philip Morris , his CB and two-way radios turned on , his portable phone plugged into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His stainless steel Colt Anaconda .44 with its eight-inch barrel and Bushnell Holo sight on a B-Square base was tucked under his seat within quick reach . Multiple antennas bobbed on his red 1990 Jeep Cherokee , which Bubba did not realize had been listed in the Used Car Buying Guide as a used car to avoid , or that it had been wrecked and had a hundred thousand more miles on it than the odometer showed . Bubba had no reason to doubt his good buddy , Joe " Smudge " Bruffy , who last year had sold the Jeep to Bubba for only three thousand dollars more than the Blue Book value . In fact , it was Smudge who Bubba had been talking to on the portable phone moments earlier when two other voices broke in . Bubba had n't been able to make out what the two women were saying , but the name " Chief Hammer " had been unmistakable . He knew it meant something . Bubba had been raised in a Presbyterian atmosphere of predestination , God 's will , inclusive language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college he had studied Far Eastern religions to spite his father , but none of Bubba 's acting out had eradicated the essence of his early indoctrination . Bubba believed there was purpose . Despite all setbacks and personal flaws , he had faith that if he accumulated enough good karma , or perhaps if yin and yang ever got along , he would discover the reason for his existence . So when he heard Chief Hammer 's name over the cell phone , he experienced a sudden release of gloominess and menacing persecution , a buoyant happiness and surge of power . He was transformed into the warrior on a mission he had always been destined to become as he followed Midlothian Turnpike to Muskrat 's Auto Rescue , this time for another windshield leak . Bubba snapped up the mike of his two-way Kenwood radio and switched over to the security channel . " Unit 1 to Unit 2 . " He tried to raise Honey , his wife , as he followed the four-lane artery of Southside out of Chesterfield County and into the city limits . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richmond police cruiser pulled in behind him . Bubba slowed down . " Unit 1 to Unit 2 , " Bubba tried again . No answer . Some shithead kid in a white Ford Explorer was trying to cut in front of Bubba . Bubba sped up . " Unit 1 to Unit 2 ! " Bubba hated it when his wife did n't respond to him immediately . The cop remained on Bubba 's tail , dark Oakleys staring straight into Bubba 's rearview mirror . Bubba slowed again . The punk in the Explorer tried to ease in front of Bubba , right turn signal flashing . Bubba sped up . He deliberated over what form of communication to use next , and picked up his portable phone . He changed his mind . He thought about trying his wife again on the two-way and decided not to bother . She should have gotten back to him the first and second times . The hell with her . He snapped up the mike to his CB , eyeing the cop in his mirrors and keeping a check on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his buddy over the CB . " You on track come back to yack . " " Unit 2 , " his wife 's out-of-breath voice came over the two-way . Bubba 's portable phone rang . " Sorry ... oh my ... " Honey sweetly said as she gasped . " I was ... oh dear ... let me catch my breath ... whew ... was chasing Half Shell ... she would n't come ... That dog . " Bubba ignored her . He answered the phone . " Bubba ? " said Gig Dan , Bubba 's supervisor at Philip Morris . " Trackin ' and yackin ' , buddy , " Smudge came back over the CB . " Unit 2 to Unit 1 ? " Honey anxiously persisted over the two-way . " Yo , Gig , " Bubba said into the portable phone . " What 's goin ' on ? " " Need ya to come in and work the second half of second shift , " Gig told him . " Tiller called in sick . " Shit , Bubba thought . Today of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little time . It depressed the hell out of him to think about showing up at eight o'clock tonight and working twelve straight hours . " Ten-4 , " Bubba replied to Gig . " When you wan na shine on yellow eyes ? " Smudge had n't given up . Bubba did n't really like coon hunting all that much . His coon dog Half Shell had her problems , and Bubba worried about snakes . Besides , Smudge always got a higher score . It seemed all Bubba did was lose money to him . " Before slithers wake up , I guess . " Bubba tried to sound sure of himself . " So go ahead and shake out a plan . " " Ten-fo , good buddy , " Smudge came back . " Gotcha covered like a blanket . "
