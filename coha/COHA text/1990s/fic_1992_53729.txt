ContentsYOSHIKO SAFELY DELIVERED A BABY BOY # THAT IT WAS YOSHIKO who was writhing face down on the bed , Motoda could tell at a glance . <p> There was a big silk tree outside the window of the dispensary . Through the branches one could look up at the patients ' rooms across the inner garden . Although it was so far that he could not even make out the design of Yoshiko 's light summer kimono , he could hear her retching sounds from here . Rather than vomit , she was bringing up a yellowish , sticky liquid somewhat like drool . It gave even Motoda a sick feeling in the chest . <p> " We 'll keep her under observation another three or four days . If the mother herself seems to be in danger , you may have to resign yourself to losing the child . In that case , we will consult with you , " the doctor told Motoda . <p> " Yes . " As if to avoid the doctor 's eyes , Motoda kept his gaze fixed on Yoshiko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor thought they were a properly married couple . Even at the time of their first visit to the hospital , in the doctor 's comment that they had come a trifle late there was a dubious echo , as if he suspected their relationship . The petite Yoshiko , who just this spring had graduated from girls ' school , looked as if she were better suited to a child 's undress obi . Her hair was still not long enough to do up . It seemed somehow unfair that she should be emaciated from morning sickness . Yoshiko had hated to go to the hospital . Motoda himself , ashamed , had kept putting it off . <p> When her name was called , Yoshiko , about to enter the examination room , had come back two or three steps , stopped , and looked at Motoda . It was as if she were trying to smile at him about something . Then , seeming to notice the strangeness of her action , she 'd abruptly blushed . Even the nurse had turned toward Motoda . <p> After Yoshiko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they were properly married . But an opportunity to formally state that had not arisen . <p> " Her suffering like this is probably due to her having married a little too early , do you think ? " he 'd tried saying . <p> " No , that 's not likely . It 's her constitution . " <p> The doctor , also , had looked up at Yoshiko 's room . <p> The flowers of the silk tree , a pale suffused pink , floated up against the unusual blue sky of an interval in the rainy season . Yoshiko 's window appeared among the green leaves below . She was , after all , like a young girl . <p> Holding both hands hard against her stomach , her chest pressed against her doubled-up knees , she was twisting her head as if in agony . Both head and shoulders stuck out over the edge of the bed . She seemed ready to tumble off the bed any moment in a somersault . <p> Motoda hastily left the dispensary . Entering the sickroom , he raised Yoshiko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek resting against Motoda 's chest , her breath harsh and gasping , Yoshiko moaned . <p> " Where did the nurse go to ? " <p> " I do n't want a nurse . I do n't want a nurse . " Shaking her head , Yoshiko clung to Motoda 's arm . Even her palms exuded a clammy sweat . Motoda wiped her forehead . Yoshiko , also , gripping the sleeve of her yukata , wiped away the droollike liquid around her mouth . When Motoda started to change her out of her yukata , Yoshiko , saying " wait a moment , " stretching out her legs , lay on her side . <p> " Are you in pain ? " Motoda asked . <p> " No . " Yoshiko smiled at him . " Ara ? The pain , where did it go ? What happened to it ? It 's funny . I 'm well again . Maybe it 's because you are here ... " <p> And when Motoda handed her the teacup , Yoshiko , closing her eyes , drank the green tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to whistle , she smiled brightly at him . <p> " Wo n't you have something to eat in a little while ? " <p> " No . No . Please do n't talk about food . It 'll make me sick again . " Filling a basin with water , Motoda began wiping Yoshiko 's body . Yoshiko sat upright on the bed , but unless he grasped her shoulder with one hand , she seemed ready to fall over in a faint . Yoshiko 's delicate shoulder bones made themselves felt against his fingers . On her back , from her nape , on which her schoolgirlish tan had suddenly paled , Yoshiko 's downy baby hairs met his eye . <p> Yoshiko asked Motoda to pull the curtains shut and close the door behind him . Standing in the doorway , Motoda looked back at her . Her narrow pelvis , which the doctor had said might mean a slightly difficult birth , filled him with pity . When she had been measured by the nurse , Yoshiko had n't even said it hurt . The marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had changed her into a fresh yukata , Yoshiko rubbed her feet between the toes . Pellets of black grime came off on her fingertips . Motoda grimaced . Raising her face , Yoshiko asked : <p> " You 've talked with the doctor , have n't you ? " <p> " Um . " <p> " What ... what did he say ? That it 's no good ? Did he tell you it was no good ? " As she questioned him , big tears dropped from Yoshiko 's eyes . " I 'm going to give birth , no matter what . Even if I die  --  so please let me have the baby . Promise me ... " Her lips were twitching convulsively . <p> " It 's all right . Everything will be all right . It would be good if you would just eat a little something . " <p> " So ? I 'll eat anything . " As she said this , Yoshiko again went pale , as if she had goose flesh or were about to vomit . Gently , Motoda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just take away that photograph ... " <p> It was the graduation day photograph from her girls ' school . Yoshiko had even brought it with her to the hospital . <p> " I 'm going to die . " <p> " Stop it . You fool . " <p> " But here , I 'm like the only person that died . Is n't that so ? I 'm sure to die . " <p> When the photograph had been taken , Yoshiko had been the only person absent . Above the lined-up graduating class , Yoshiko 's photograph had been inserted afterward , all by itself . <p> Yoshiko had not been able to attend the graduation ceremony because she had run away from home and come to Motoda 's place . <p> Yoshiko 's family were sake brewers in a country town . Graduation meant that already marriage proposals were being brought forward . Yoshiko confessed to her mother that she had promised to marry Motoda . Motoda , as the son of a tatami maker , who had studied in conditions of hardship at the university , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission being given . The father , a man in the mold of an old-fashioned family head , had soundly berated Yoshiko . Half out of mortification , Yoshiko had fled to Motoda 's place . <p> When Motoda had returned to his apartment , he had found Yoshiko , her eyelids inflamed with weeping , planted on the floor . Although it would have been well if she had sent a telegram from the train or telephoned his office , Yoshiko had n't exercised even that sort of forethought . Evidently she had been weeping timidly . When she saw Motoda , just as if she had been waiting for someone whom she had no hope would return , she greeted him with a sort of sad happiness . <p> She did n't seem like a lover who had run a romantic risk . She seemed somehow like the melancholy husk of a person . That , perversely , made Motoda want to take her in his arms . <p> Yoshiko 's family must have thought their daughter surely not bold enough to run off to Motoda . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives and friends . It was four or five days later that Yoshiko 's older sister came to Motoda 's apartment . At any rate , Yoshiko had been taken back by the sister . <p> It was about three months later that Yoshiko was found to be pregnant and a marriage was hastily arranged . The ceremony was performed in Tokyo , as if in secret . Nevertheless , Yoshiko 's mother , staying in the house of the newlyweds , purchased her daughter 's trousseau before going home . <p> It could be said that the married life of the two had begun with Yoshiko 's violent bouts of morning sickness . <p> In that small country town , Yoshiko 's affair was soon known at the girls ' school . Although she had passed all her examinations with high marks , she had been absent from the graduation ceremony and had run away to a man 's place . In the subsequent furor there was talk of taking away her diploma . <p> Whenever Yoshiko and Motoda looked at the graduation ceremony photograph these things were always remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , floating in a little void above , was a commemoration of their union , a song , as it were , of the victory of love . <p> Even the miserable figure of Yoshiko , as she waited for Motoda at the apartment , was now thought of as poetically beautiful . Yoshiko 's adventure , the two believed , was the flame of love . <p> Yoshiko would take out the photograph repeatedly and gaze at it , most likely because she still felt a fresh nostalgia for girls ' school . <p> But when Yoshiko told him that only she looked like a dead person in the photograph , Motoda could not laugh it off . Was the fact that Yoshi-ko 's photograph was by itself a dark indication of an unusual fate ? It seemed unlucky . It was the custom with commemorative photographs to insert the image of a deceased person in this manner . <p> Yoshiko 's morning sickness was evidently pernicious . It so debilitated her that she was given injections of nutrients . Although she had gotten over the morning sickness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessitate an abortive operation . The outcome was uncertain . If the situation continued unchanged another three or four days , the doctor said , Yoshiko 's life itself would be in danger . <p> The sense of Yoshiko 's words , that she wanted to give birth even if she died , suggested , not maternal love , but the delirium of a person somewhat deranged by illness . <p> And yet , Yoshiko 's desire to have this child came through clearly to Motoda . They were a couple who would not have been married if there had not been this child . For Yoshiko , especially , the painful road to marriage lay through this child . She must be suffering . If she were to sacrifice such a child , there was no sign that she would be able to endure the void afterward . There was the fear of sin as well , but what was strangest was an indescribable uneasiness . Yoshiko , already , wanted nothing more than to cling blindly to this child . <p> " In the lecture hall , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rows . I 'll probably be laughed at . Or , if I die , perhaps they 'll feel sorry for me . " <p> Tossing aside the photograph , Yoshiko closed her eyes . Beneath her hollowed eyelids the restlessly moving eyeballs were visible . And then there was no end to the tears . It was as if the tear glands had loosened . <p> " If I die now , I 'll take the baby with me , so it will be as if you were dying with me . It 's unforgivable , but I would be happy . " While saying this , Yoshiko took out a scrap of paper from underneath her pillow . When Motoda looked at it , it was a detailed list , divided into summer and winter , of which kimonos and undergarments of his were in which drawer in the bureau . There was even an inventory of kitchen utensils . <p> " I wrote it because it would be a disgrace if people came and you did n't know what to do . " <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Motoda 's heart grew dark . What a pathetic last will and testament . It was written in pencil , in the painstaking calligraphy of a prize-winning pupil at the girls ' school . <p> Motoda resolved to have measures taken by the doctor . Yoshiko 's tearful eyes were clear to their very depths . Motoda was afraid of the shadow of death he saw in them . <p> Once again wiping off her sweaty body , he touched the little breasts . They alone were cold . Motoda averted his eyes , blinking back the tears . <p> Nonetheless , Yoshiko 's morning sickness had vanished as if by magic . Most likely it was the efficacy of the treatment , but it also seemed that a demon that had possessed her had passed out of her . <p> In the days that followed Yoshiko began to gorge herself alarmingly . In no time , she became plump . With no care for her appearance , she worked busily all day long . She changed into a girl who might have been born into a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if she had forgotten the baby in her womb , she flew about the house , singing to herself like a schoolgirl . Motoda had never seen Yoshiko this lively . <p> When she sat , the weight around her hips mounded solidly . She had suddenly acquired a wifely physique . On her arms , too , the hard , muscled flesh bulged , resisting the touch . Even in her lovemaking the strength of a love-hungry woman began flickeringly to burn . The unease of giving birth was forgotten . The pair were swamped in a fresh sexual happiness . <p> One morning , however , Motoda awakened to Yoshiko 's stifled sounding voice . She was smoking a cigarette in bed . <p> " Hey . " <p> Motoda tried to snatch the cigarette out of her . mouth . <p> " Is n't it all right to smoke ? " Yoshiko opposed him . Motoda , against the very idea of a woman smoking in bed in the morning , upbraided her . <p> " There 's the baby , so I 'm sleepy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , Yoshiko turned her back to him and puffed out a cloud of smoke . " I 've been smoking for a while now . " <p> Flabbergasted at Yoshiko 's sulky defiance , Motoda stared at her for a moment . " You fool . " Abruptly , he pounded her shoulder with his fist . <p> Yoshiko jumped out of bed . When she had slapped and folded and put away her own bedding , she tore off Motoda 's coverlet and with a grunt of effort jerked up the underquilt . Motoda tumbled out onto the tarami . <p> Abashed by Yoshiko 's extraordinary strength , Motoda admonished her quietly , telling her she would have a miscarriage if she went on that way . <p> " It does n't matter . This child is going to be born under a tombstone anyway . " Giving a high , nasal laugh , Yoshiko , on this morning alone doing the maid 's work , deliberately exerting herself , heaved the quilt into the cupboard . " I had a bad dream . It made me very sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crying voice in the graveyard . It had been born out of the belly of a dead person . A pale belly , like a frog 's belly . The moon was shining . Ohh , it was scary . " Yoshiko shuddered . <p> Was this a sign that the morning sickness would recur , Motoda wondered . But Yoshiko 's manner of recounting the dream was curiously listless . Had she really had that kind of dream ? Motoda was unable to believe her . Perhaps she was talking about something she had read in a book as if it were her own dream . <p> Of late , the lovability of Yoshiko 's voice , as if she were earnestly depending on Motoda , had been lost . It had become a thick , sticky voice that sounded capable of calmly telling lies . <p> In the kitchen also , as if shoving the maid away , she did everything . Before Motoda she set out an egg , laver , vegetables boiled hard in soy sauce and the like . But there was no miso soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just the smell of miso makes me want to puke . Have the maid make some , and eat it when I 'm not around . " <p> Not even looking at him , she gobbled and slurped up three or four bowls of salted laver in green tea . She was positively cheeky . <p> Noticing Yoshiko 's eccentric diet , Motoda warned her that it was bad for the nurture of the fetus . <p> " If it 's badly nurtured , wo n't the birth be easy ? " Yoshiko countered . <p> Holes appeared in Motoda 's socks . The cuffs of his white shirts were soiled . <p> " Do n't take off your shoes at the office . I ca n't be bothered with every little thing . For a tatami maker 's son , you 're quite the dandy , are n't you ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " Is n't that so ? Are n't you the son of a tatami maker ? " <p> When Motoda had searched for the whereabouts of his socks and white shirts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's last will and testament . He thrust it at Yoshiko . " You should remember this . " <p> Where had the pitiful , adorable Yoshiko of that time gone to ? <p> As Motoda changed his socks by himself , Yoshiko tore up the last will and testament into little pieces and flung them out into the garden where the midsummer sun had been shining brilliantly since morning . Revealed by the pulled-back collar of her yukata , the beautiful flesh of Yoshiko 's neck and shoulders gleamed with rude health as if it had been rubbed with perfumed ointment . Suddenly the thought came to Motoda that this was not his Yoshiko but a common prostitute . He closed his eyes . <p> For the next two or three days Yoshiko hardly spoke to Motoda . She became extraordinarily fastidious , saying that it was because the unborn infant was holy . The young Motoda , who had just graduated from the university the year before , submitted to Yoshiko . <p> Forgetting makeup , Yoshiko grew dour-visaged . The bones of her cheeks stood out . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight at Motoda . As if driven by a violent strength that welled up from the depths of her body , she gave herself willingly to physical labor . <p> Motoda instructed the maid not to let Yoshiko work too hard . Four or five days later , the maid came crying to Motoda , saying that she 'd been let go . This maid was a girl whom Yoshiko had brought with her from the country and who was devoted to Yoshiko . When Motoda put in a word for the maid , Yoshiko flared up angrily . " The maid comes crying to you and tells you everything ? What is this ? It 's indecent . What are you two talking about ? Are you keeping secrets from me ? " <p> For the first time Motoda realized that Yoshiko was afflicted with morbid jealousy . Her show of antipathy to each and every little item of gossip that he brought back from the office , he now saw , was because of that . He would have to be careful , Motoda told himself . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although Yoshiko was a sweet-natured girl who was also loved by others , she evidently looked upon people as enemies these days . Her gentle , lovable feelings had vanished . And the pure-mannered refinement of a daughter of an old family was gone also . It was not likely that Yoshiko would have led this sort of lowlife existence in the country . <p> Even on her eccentric diet , when she would eat nothing but tuna sashimi for a week , Yoshiko grew fatter and fatter . She was in high spirits . And yet Motoda doubted whether her air of health was not false , an empty picture . It seemed as if it might collapse any minute . Was it , after all , unreasonable for one of Yoshiko 's physique to have a child ? It was as though she were possessed by a demon and living on the energy of that demon . To state it extremely , it was as though Yoshiko herself had wasted away , while a life separate from hers , using her as its instrument , was allowing her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish delusions , there was such a thing as prenatal influence . If Yoshiko 's vagaries even somewhat foreshadowed the nature of the child , what kind of baby would be born ? It was a frightening thought . <p> At any rate , the peace and happiness of the household had been completely destroyed . Yoshiko , as if squaring her shoulders , went against Motoda in everything . Day after day the ugly quarrels continued . Mo-toda 's heart , also , became desolate . <p> Thinking that the brutal heat of the city , which Yoshiko had never experienced , might be harmful for one in her condition , Motoda suggested that for the summer she return to the country . Yoshiko suspiciously accused him of wanting to get rid of her . A scene ensued , during which she chucked a teacup at him . <p> And yet , as she lay one night inside the mosquito-netting , saying , " The baby moved , " Yoshiko smiled with unexpected gentleness , like a flower breaking into bloom . She closed her eyes . <p> " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Motoda smiled also . <p> " Do n't touch it ! " With a shrill screech , Yoshiko threw off his hand . " You are cruel . You 're cruel to the child . I know all about it . When I was at the hospital , although I begged you with tears in my eyes to let me have the child even if I died for it , on your way home that day you told the doctor you did n't need a baby . How you shamed me . I thought I would die together with the child . But when it gets older I 'm going to tell it what you did . That 's right . The doctor told me everything , so I 'm not making it up . " <p> Probably the doctor , after Yoshiko 's morning sickness had gone away , had made a joke of it , saying that for a while there her condition had been so bad that Motoda had been that worried about it . For Yo-shiko to use that as a pretext for the venomous promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up indicated terrific ill will . Even Motoda could not accept it tamely . <p> " You did n't like it when I came to you as a bride in this condition . That alone is bad of you . I was a child , I did n't know anything . I believed in you blindly . I only came to talk it over with you , but you made it so that I could n't go back . That 's what my father was the most angry about . He said a real man would have said the girl 's not old enough , and we 'll talk about it after I 've sent her home for now , while she 's still a virgin . You did n't have to treat me that way . I would n't have gone against you . I did n't come to Tokyo because I wanted to get married like a juvenile runaway . I wanted a marriage that I could have beautiful memories about . But now ... I do n't even want to think about it . " <p> Motoda did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like these . ff she said them , it was the end . Motoda experienced a chilly disillusion . <p> Perhaps a woman , worshiping her own purity , hated to have it defiled . Perhaps this hatred , lying latent in Yoshiko , had spewed forth on this occasion . But it took Motoda somewhat by surprise that Yoshiko had always resented the very first relations between them . <p> It became disagreeable for Motoda to say anything . For the first time , as Yoshiko lay face down , weeping away , he felt a physical aversion toward her . Hers seemed the slovenly figure of a woman who had lost her sense of shame . Until now Motoda had thought Yoshiko lovable , darling when she had fled home for his apartment . Although there was a sadness about it , it was not an ugly memory . <p> Motoda came to ask himself if a genuine loathing were not implicit in Yoshiko 's resistance . <p> Even Yoshiko seemed to grow afraid of her abnormal psychological state . Talking it over with Motoda , she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcove , and now and then performed the tea ceremony . <p> Just as Motoda began thinking , ah , that 's nice , Yoshiko , rummaging through the wastepaper basket by Motoda 's writing table , examined every scrap of paper . That would n't have been so bad , but she also plucked letters out of the maid 's basket and nervously perused them . When there was a violent thunderstorm , even though the north-facing paper sliding doors of the maid 's room were getting soaked , Yoshiko noticed nothing . <p> Not long after , the maid quit of her own free will . Although she left in tears , grieving from her heart over this separation from Yoshiko , the latter afterward enumerated all the maid 's faults . Did Yoshiko have such unkindly eyes ? Motoda thought in dismay . <p> And so when he saw the letter that Yoshiko was evidently sending to her folks in the country , Motoda could only think that she was touched in the head . Yoshiko seemed to have written the letter at his desk . The sheaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she should be sending this kind of half-finished draft of a letter . <p> The drift of the letter was that although she was pregnant she was daily mistreated by Motoda , that she just could n't stand it any longer , and that she wanted a divorce . Although Motoda had struck her just once , that morning when Yoshiko had been smoking a cigarette , in the letter she claimed that he beat her constantly and kicked her about . Was she exaggerating for the effect it would have on her parents , or was she suffering from a persecution complex ? Motoda could not tell . At any rate , there seemed to be nothing for it but to have her family take her in for the time being . Yoshiko had written that she could not give birth to the child in this place . <p> This time , also , Yoshiko 's older sister came to get her . <p> Apparently the maid who had gone home before her had told the family something of the situation . The older sister did not take Motoda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When a woman is pregnant , depending on the person , she has to be treated with great tenderness . Was n't there something that started all of this ? You 're awfully young , Motoda-san , and Yoshiko herself is just a child .... " <p> Yoshiko , forgetting what she had written about wanting a divorce , wept and begged Motoda repeatedly to come when the baby was born . Asking whether her makeup and clothes were all right , she came to show them to him . She clung to his hand and would not let go . Motoda could only think that it was himself alone who was in the wrong . Yoshiko 's hair had grown much longer , but at her hairline it was a little thinner than before . <p> " It 's funny . She 's become quite plump , has n't she ? " Yoshiko 's older sister said upon their departure . <p> Without a word to Motoda , in the drawer of his writing table Yoshiko had left another " last will and testament . " The incomprehensible feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he read it . Everything was noted in detail , down to her own kimonos and detachable collars . Did Yoshiko think she would not return to this house ? <p> No matter how many letters Motoda sent , there was no answer from Yoshiko . Word came from the maid who had previously been with them that the mother was intercepting all his letters and not showing them to Yoshiko . <p> To be forced apart like this  --  it was like a bad dream , this brief married life of theirs . But start in the middle of the night , a painful love , as if Yoshiko were about to die any minute , over-flowed inside him . <p> YOSHIKO SAFELY DELIVERED A BABY BOY When Motoda received the telegram , it was already late autumn . When he entered her room , Yoshiko , with a sunny smile , looked up at him steadily . Then , when she 'd raked up a stray curl behind her ear , as if she had just then noticed that it was there , she gave her breast to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk . " <p> " Not much comes out .

It was beautiful , as if it had been washed clean . <p> " Such a darling little mother . It 's so funny ... " So saying , Yoshiko 's mother entered the room . <p> Indeed , Yoshiko seemed somehow to have grown smaller . Once again , she was the appealing , adorable young girl . <p> The evening moon was shining on the fruits of the persimmon tree on the far side of the chrysanthemum patch . <p> " They 're pretty . " <p> " Yes , this year it 's the persimmon 's turn to bear fruit . " Together with Motoda , the mother looked at the persimmon tree . <p> Was this all there was to it , Motoda wondered curiously . He could not believe it all at once . <p> The new living creature with an innocent , monkeylike face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into several different persons , sucked strongly at the breast of the mother whom it had at one time brought face to face with death and at another driven to the edge of insanity . <p> <p> By KAWABATA YASUNARI <p> Translated by Lane Dunlop <p>
