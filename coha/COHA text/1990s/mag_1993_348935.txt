) For decades Los Angeles was America 's dreamland , glistening with promise and expectation . It was the city of tomorrow , a constant experiment that seemed to produce a life-style without trade-offs . A garden in the desert . A melting pot that was seldom stirred up . An economy that moved in only one direction . Most things new and fresh in America seemed to start there : everything from car loans to health clubs to Chino-Latino cuisine . For a while there were no limits : on growth , on space , on creativity , on wealth , on tolerance of the new and the foreign . Never mind the earthquakes , the smog , the religious cults . Those were just the shadows around an otherwise Utopian vision . And the new arrivals to the City of Angels and its palmy suburbs just kept on coming . <P> Many people began to sense that America 's second largest city was growing but not maturing . The formal notification arrived a year ago this month , when the city exploded in the worst riots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features have been held up to a far different light . Much of what seemed modern and alluring about Los Angeles now seems terribly shortsighted and ugly . The ethnic patchwork appears to be a map of bunkered enclaves . Its center can not hold because the city does n't have one . The land without limits keeps running into dead ends : not enough money for schools , housing for newcomers , jobs for the working class , room to move . The laboratory of change produces the latest in urban ills : crack cocaine , gang culture , police brutality , civic indifference , a spectacular gap between rich and poor . Increasingly , the rest of America hopes the latest in L.A. trends will stay right where they started . <P> If the picture looks bleak from afar , it is even worse from the pavement in the scarred city . In the immediate aftermath of last year 's riots , which left 53 dead and $500 million in property damage , the city rallied together for a moment of giddy anticipation that the trauma would lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of the city 's values , political leadership and sense of shared responsibility . It did n't last long . L.A. 's wealthy classes quickly fobbed off the burden of reconstruction to small volunteer organizations and an overstretched investment drive ; the lame- duck mayor receded into city hall ; the Federal Government turned its back ; minority groups fumed about the patronizing attitude of their would-be helpers ; police remained mostly unrepentant about the Rodney King beating ; and gangs declared a truce but kept on selling drugs and robbing people . <P> What has aggravated the city 's racial divisiveness is the lack of a strong economy to rebuild on . Los Angeles remains mired in a three-year recession , with a countywide 10.4% unemployment rate , 3 1/2 points higher than the U.S. average . In poor black neighborhoods , the rate is as high as 50% . The peace dividend of the post-cold war era has landed like a bomb in the Los Angeles area , wiping out 110,000 defense-industry jobs so far and possibly another 50,000 more by the end of next year . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have evaporated because of corporate cutbacks . L.A. 's South Central district lost more than 70,000 jobs in the 1970s and ' 80s ; the poverty rate for area families now is higher than it was at the time of the Watts riots in 1965.
