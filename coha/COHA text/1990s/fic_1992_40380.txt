This weekend , between the World Series and Halloween , I 'm alone . Ellen 's in Buffalo for our daughter Annie 's thirty-sixth birthday . Friday , I drove her to Midway , then went downtown to my one-room office on Adams , checked the markets , bought a Kansas City municipal , faxed a letter to our insurance agent , sent copies of our living wills to our granddaughter  --  old enough now to be in on it ; who knows , she might be the one to unplug the tubes  --  and walked five blocks to the Pub Club for the best hour of the day , lunch at the Round Table on the eleventh floor looking over the silver river and the blue bulge of the State of Illinois Building . <p> I 've been a club member 5 years . It 's more important than ever now that I 've retired . I used to ridicule my Uncle Bert 's New York life , a shuttle between the City Athletic Club and his rooms at the Hotel Warwick across the street . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance . Now my Chicago life resembles his  --  I arrive early enough  --  11:45  --  to ensure a seat at the Round Table . ( It 's gauche to turn up earlier , but if you come as late as 11:50 , the table 's full and you take your chances with less congenial company . ) The table does n't have the best view , but I 've had enough scenic views in my life . I hunger for the day 's stories , for jokes , for the latest aches , grandkids , market tips , slants on the news . <p> We usually start with stories in the Wall Street Journal , the Trib , and the New York Times . Mike Royko 's column gets a big play from us . International , national , local news , the latest this or that . We 've got fellows who follow science , books , and arts  --  we 're all readers and TV watchers . Mondays we go over the Bears ' game . We cover restaurants , travel  --  we 're a worldly bunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles : I 'm the leftwinger ; three or four of us are political Neanderthals basically unhappy that Gorbachev changed the old game . Two regulars have been Assistant Secretaries ( one of State , one of Commerce ) and one of us was on Reagan 's Economic Council ; we feel we 're privy to inside dope . Anecdotes about politics in Washington and Chicago are one of our stocks-in-trade . <p> The talk I prefer is personal . Friday , we talked about fathers : time has cleared mine of wrong , translating his naivete into honesty , his timidity into modesty . I told how he read the morning Times , so lost in it he flicked cigarette ash into his coffee and drank it without blinking . No one laughed . I described his going down the elevator in his pajamas , forgetting his address in a taxi . I drew another blank : the Round Tablers know what 's around our own corners . We 've all had operations . Bill Trask 's back curls with osteoporosis , Harlan Schneirman 's lip from last year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feature of our talk . <p> Of his father , Harry Binswanger says , " I scarcely knew him . " Though he 's been in America more than 40 years , German phonemes pass in and out of his speech . Till he retired , he was my dentist , a good one , though Dr. Werner , my dentist since , says my mouth was in poor shape when I came to him . Harry  --  it used to be Heinz  --  is large , clumsy , thick-fingered . I felt secure with the heft of his fingers around my jaw , though they may have handicapped the delicacy of his bridge and canal work . I 've heard something of his history for 25 years , but there 's always more to know . Nor do I mind listening to what 's familiar . ( I 'd have to leave the Round Table if I did . ) Harry 's parents divorced when he was eight . He visited his father in Mainz every Christmas . " Muzzer sent him my presents . He unwrapped zem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Harry shook his head , a semaphore of passed anger . " He vass eggcentric , eggcitable , unshtable , could n't make a living . Muzzer 's fazzer said she deserfed vat she got , marrying ' a hergelaufenen Juden , ' ' a Jew from God knows vere . ' Fazzer had a farm near zuh Neckar Riffer . He bought turkeys ; zey drowned ; he bought marigolds  --  he luffed flowers ; zuh riffer flooded zem ; he bought pigs ; zey broke out of zuh penss . Grandpa said , ' Not even pigs vill stay wiz him . ' He became a portrait photographer , but vass no good wiz children . He vanted a picture uff me on zuh river , crying . I vould n't sit on zuh raft . He tied me zere , slapped my face : ' Now cry . ' <p> " He put his photographs in  --  vat-do-you-say ?  --  a cabinet wiz a glass front . Vitrine . Tough kids  --  Nazi toughs  --  broke it . He said , ' It 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil . He 'd been born in Bukovina , the Romanians lost his papers . At zuh emigration office zey said , ' Fir uns , bestehen Sie gpr nicht . ' ' For us , you do n't exist . ' He vass shtuck . Somehow he made it srough zuh war . I saw him after , vonce . He lived in a basement room , zuh rest of zuh block was wrecked . Outside his vindow were a few inches of dirt wiz zree zinnias . " Driving back home , along the Lake by the Museum of Natural History , it struck me that Harry 's in-and-out German accent was his mind 's way of preserving that hergelaufener father of his , even as his stories turned him into comic relief . <p> Ellen called at eight o'clock . " How 're you doing ? " <p> " Fine . I warmed up the chicken . Delicious . How 's Annie ? " <p> She was fine , so were Chuck and little Anne , the Buffalo weather was being its notorious self ; the plane was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I 'll see you Monday . " <p> " You 'd better . " <p> Though it was nice to be alone , a hue of freedom I had n't noticed that I had n't noticed , at the same time , the house felt loose around me , slightly spooky . <p> In my leather armchair , I read a new book about an escaped prisoner and stopped at a German phrase I did n't really understand . ( The second time today . ) " Die Unlesbarkeit dieser Welt . " " The illegibility of this world . " But the German pleased me , and I repeated the words till they felt at home on my tongue . Their author , a poet named Celan , was born  --  another coincidence  --  in Romania . His mother was killed in a death camp  --  the phrase suddenly made sense  --  and , decades later , he drowned himself in the Seine . <p> There 's a quiver in my pleasant self-sufficiency ; but I am comfortable , I am snug , taken care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who knows , maybe Harry 's father , in his basement , looking out at his zinnias , felt the same ; having survived what so few had might have been his comfort . Harry himself had been sent to Amsterdam , and , like Anne Frank , hidden . After the war , unlike Anne , he 'd gone to a Dutch school . Had I forgotten , or never known , how he 'd gotten to America , this man with whom I 'd spent five or six hours a week for 25 years , whose hands had been in my mouth , to whom I 'd paid thousands of dollars ? <p> Saturday morning , I drove up to see my son , Peter . He 'd moved again , the third time in five years . He gets bored with a neighborhood , seeks what he calls " action . " A large , rangy boy  --  I should n't say boy , he 's thirty-two  --  with lots of energy , he 's chosen to be a salesman because he ca n't sit still . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks a month . He does n't much like the job , or any other he 's had . The routines of money-making , the hierarchy of business authority , the cheerleading and critiques of salesmanship , the ups and downs of sales , go against his grain . And grain he has . As a boy , he was exceptionally gentle ; in adolescence , he assumed a roughness which I felt contradicted his nature . He 's still rough , argumentative , sarcastic , but now he mocks the roughness and regards it as a comic scurf he can remove at will . Deep down  --  whatever this means  --  is the gentle boy he was at five and six ; very lovable . <p> A year after he graduated from the University of Illinois in Champaign , he married a girl he met in a singles bar ; a year later they divorced . He asked his mother and me why we had n't stopped him from marrying . " Could n't you see it was a mistake ? " <p> His mother said she 'd suspected it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked Louise . " Ten years and many girls later , he 's still unsettled . I ask him , " How long can you go on being Casanova ? " <p> " Envious " <p> " A little . Mostly worried . Not just about disease . This is a critical decade of your life . Squander it courting , you 'll end up like the Queen in Alice in Wonderland , just where you are . " <p> " What 's wrong with that ? " <p> " I do n't mind , but I think you do . " <p> His new apartment is on the first floor of a red-brick six-flat on one of the thousand tree-lined , quiet streets which root Chicago in a domestic independence which gets it through bad times better than the other industrial cities around the Lakes , Cleveland , Detroit , Erie . <p> The front door is open ; he 's been watching for me . I follow him into a bright room with an old couch , an armchair , a stack of pictures leaning against the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stereo , no TV . " I do n't want to get addicted . " His addiction is bars , music , girls , cigarettes . There are four rooms , all in more or less the same tumbled shape , though the kitchen has a built-in orderliness . " Nice , " I say . " It 's light , the rooms are a good size , it 's a pretty street . How much 're you paying , may I ask ? " <p> " Five hundred . " <p> " I should move down here myself . " <p> " Too much action for you . " <p> " Not that I can see . Except for the hurricane that hit your place . " <p> " Come back in two weeks , it 'll be immaculate . Ready to play ? " <p> Now and then he consents to play tennis with me . I 've been playing over half a century , and still get around pretty well . I know where the ball 's coming and get it back . Peter has speed and power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me any points , but I can frustrate him with tenacity and junk shots . Then he starts slamming balls out , or laughs so hard he misses them altogether . Now and then he gets angry  --  " Hit the goddamn ball "  --  but rarely , and I enjoy playing with him . Since I had a hernia operation a couple of years ago , the old sweetness of his boyhood comes through , and he 's been easy on me . There 's also some  --  I suppose classic  --  resentment . As we drive a few blocks to the public courts on Montrose , he tells me what a lucky life I 've led . " You retired early ; you 've had a good marriage , you 've got a granddaughter , and except for that hernia , you have n't been sick ; you still play tennis , you liked your job , you 've got some dough , you have n't been hassled  --  " <p> " The demographics were in my favor . No baby boom . " <p> " Right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't much of a boomer . " <p> " Two 's more than enough . " <p> There 's some sibling resentment , though he and Annie are very good friends . <p> It 's a bit chilly . I keep my windbreaker on , but play well , serve hard , and hit good backhands . I run Peter around the court , which he needs . He sets up the game so he has to chase around . Life cramps him . He spends too much time in cars , writing reports , closed up in his apartment , in bars . On vacations he goes to national parks where he climbs or paddles through white water . A few times he 's gone to the Alps and the Pyrenees . But it 's not enough for him . <p> Sometimes I feel that I stand in his way , a wordless  --  usually wordless  --  rebuke to his life . Then too I was off a lot on sales trips  --  neckwear , accessories  --  when he grew up ; he missed me and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic to him than the chore it was . He thinks I 've seen much more than I have , know much more than I do . I feel that he hardly knows me at all , which I do n't mind . Should fathers and sons know each other Or love each other ? Well , I love him , though there are gaps of cold in all affection . Yet if the love is n't constant , it is recurrent . That should be enough for security , should n't it ? <p> I win the set , 6-3 . A rarity . We play another , and I do n't win a game . I 'm delighted . I always either try hard or appear to try hard , but it 's been years since I 've wanted to do better than Peter at anything . I want him to have what I 've had and more . Above all , I want him to have  --  to want to have , and have  --  a child . <p> Back at his place , I clean up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He comes into the living room , the towel working over his wet body . I have n't seen him naked for years , and I 'm a little shocked . He 's very hairy , has a bit of a belly . This man , who as a boy looked like an angel , is into middle age . I look away . I do n't want to see him this way . There 's a book open on the beaten couch , I move it and sit down . " What 's this ? " I ask . He 's got on his jockey shorts . His legs are enormous , they should be running up and down basketball courts or hills . <p> " Kafka , " he says . <p> " Never really read him . Good stuff ? " <p> " Not exactly . " He 's buttoning a blue shirt . <p> " You ought to read that one . " <p> " ' Ought to ' ? " <p> " You 'd understand me better . " <p> " Maybe that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Read it . Take it home . But return it . I need it for my sessions . " <p> " Your doctor 's paid to understand you . All I have to do is love you . " <p> He 's put on blue jeans . " What 's to love ? " <p> " I 'd better read it . " <p> He 's putting on white socks and sneakers . " How do you know it 's me you love if you do n't understand me ? " <p> " That 's too complicated . Do you have to understand me to love me ? " As soon as I say this , I feel the discomfort of presumption . Maybe he does n't love me . Love 's too big a word anyway . It 's used much too often . Morons in front of microphones hold out their arms to millions they have never met and cry , " I love you . " All they mean is , " How wonderful to be shining up here . " I never talked about love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , and I 'm grateful . Love was assumed . A million feelings were bunched up in it . <p> I 'm against all domestic analysis , I 'm against understanding . That word also means too much . You understand a request , a situation , but how do you understand a person ? You reduce him , that 's how . Do I understand myself ? Does Harry Binswanger understand his father ? In a way , yes , because he hardly knew him . That is , he turned his father into a little vaudeville act , a comic handle which lets him carry the hot pan around . Why did he remember " For us you do n't exist " ? Because of his own fright that his father did n't exist for him , except as some snapshots of intimidation and pathos . Not enough , he knows it 's not enough . Peter and I have had thousands and thousands of moments with each other , many of them , maybe most of them , charged with something you can call love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigeonhole that ca n't really hold the complexity of it all . <p> His blue-shirted arms lie on the seamed , brown arms of the chair ; he looks as big as Lincoln in the Memorial . He says , " I 'm paying through the nose to find out if I 'm capable of loving anyone . " <p> That night , back in my armchair , I sat down with the book . Of course I 'd heard about it often enough , but I 'd never actually read it . And I had to force myself through it , though it 's short , sixty or seventy pages , a story about a salesman , the support of his parents and sister , who wakes up one morning transformed into a huge bug . He ca n't go to work , they pound on his door , the chief clerk of the office comes to fetch him . ( It 's rather ridiculous . ) Naturally he astounds , terrifies , and disgusts his parents and the young sister who for a while takes care of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In time he annoys them so much , they want him to die ; when he does , they 're released and happy . <p> Now what in Cod 's name makes Peter think that this story has anything to do with him ? In the kitchen , I open a bottle of red wine , pour a third of it into a water glass , clip and light a cigar , and go back to my chair to think it out . <p> In the first place , Peter 's never supported us . Au contraire . In the last three years he 's made a point of not taking money from me at Christmas and his birthday , but he knows I 'm there , ready to help him . " I helped your sister when she and Chuck bought the house , and I want to help you when you 're ready to buy . " I would n't dream of his sharing , let alone , taking , a check in a restaurant . All right , then , what 's the similarity ? Does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him feel like a bug ? Does he disgust us ? Do we want him dead ? Absurd . I sit puffing , sipping . Beyond this lamplit circle , it 's dark . Here , it 's warm , comfortable , charged with the pleasure of the wine , the special , bittersweet fullness of the smoke ; yet my heart 's hammering away . Clearly , Peter feels that he 's inadequate , repulsive . What 's askew in this boy of mine ? <p> Or is he putting it on , dramatizing himself , using the author 's own self-dramatics as his crutch ? ( But Kafka invented these things , and , I think , thought they were funny . There is something funny about it . ) <p> I went to the desk and wrote a note : <p> Dear Peter , <p> Your 're no bug , and I hope I 'm not a bit like that pompous , cringing , bullying , self-righteous father . I do n't see this story as a key to you . Maybe you can explain it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago , or in one of your bars . You choose . <p> Love  --  if that 's still a permissible word  --  Dad <p> I 'm on my way upstairs to draw a bath when I wonder what the word actually means . Metamorphosis . I go down again , lift out the heavy  --  eight pounds , I once weighed it on the bathroom scale  --  first volume of the compact edition of the Oxford English Dictionary , for which we joined the Book-of-the-Month-Club about 20 years ago . I polish the big magnifying glass on my pants and read . Change of form , from the Greek . <p> Upstairs , as I unbutton my shirt , I feel restless . I need a walk . I button up , put on a sweater , exchange my moccasins for the springy walking shoes Annie gave me last Christmas , and , downstairs , put on the black leather jacket young people on the street or in stores look at in surprised approval . ( Sometimes they say something like " Nice . " ) I pat my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to be stuck outside with Ellen in Buffalo , and I hope she does n't call when I 'm out , getting the answering machine and worrying that I 'm looped around a lamppost on the Outer Drive . <p> The relief of the air , the dark . There 's moonlight after the early evening shower , the oak tree on the lawn had shed its last leaves , they 're thick on the lawn , a sea of shapes . The branches are transformed by bareness , a pre-death bareness . Lucky , in a great city , to live on a street that registers the seasons so clearly . <p> The cold air feels so wonderful . The small lights of the small houses , the interrogative iron curl of the lampposts , the pools of moonlight on the metal skin of the cars ; beautiful . I do n't want to leave this . After my operation , I vas so fatigued I did n't care about living or dying . Only the idea of leaving Ellen kept me going . Now I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , the eighty-nine-year-old mogul , William Paley , asking people why he had to die . I know life usually wears you down and you 're ready to go . Not with him . Not with me . <p> A Trib piece said Paley was a rat , sold out everyone who loved or helped him , took credit for everything ; in short , a perfect dead horse for newspaper whips . Is egomania what keeps you alive Maybe for tycoons . I do n't need an empire . Leaves are enough , the moon , the air . <p> I walk through the bank parking lot , then left on Dorchester . The maples are half-full of pumpkin-colored leaves . ( Are the ones still there the Paleys ? ) Pumpkins are lit on porches . The confidence in these houses . Chairs , lamps , bookshelves , the purple flare of TV 's . <p> I 'm the only one on the street . No , up ahead , someone 's coming . Should I turn ? No . Courage . A black man in a raincoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good evening , " the way they do in small towns , but we do n't . We just pass each other , relieved . I round the brick six-flat on the corner . Back on my block . A couple I know stands on their porch , white man , black woman . I do n't know their names . I wave , she waves . <p> My block . <p> In the bath , my body looks heavy , fattish knees big , dingus floating in soapy foam . God , man is ugly . No wonder people write about metamorphosis . My body . Peter 's . My body forming his , my mind  --  whatever that is  --  his . Chromosomes , genes , strings of sugar and protein generating versions of themselves which somehow become others . There 's some of Uncle Bert in me . Is it why I live as he did ? Transmission . This floating dingus rose to Ellen 's innards and generated Annie , and later Peter . Annie 's Anne has my stuff in her , and when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off her own spigot . Thought . Ghosts . Spooks . The world , so clear and snug , is n't . Metamorphosis . A rational man turns verminous . A rational country declares some citizens verminous and kills them . <p> I soap arms , armpits , the side where my scar begins , the left leg , the right , the crack , the ankles , the toes . Lovely . The mind lolls . What is a thought ? Form without bulk . " For us , you do n't exist . " How could he not exist ? He was there . But existence meant a paper , a name , a class . Citizen , father , uncle , niece , son , President . Tuesday 's Election Day . Men and women run to be , to be entitled . I 'll push a stylus through numbers on a card to make a governor , a senator . ( Later , they could make or unmake me . ) The father in Metamorphosis becomes a bank messenger , has a uniform with brass buttons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last Laugh , swells with pride . Fired , uniform taken away , the doorman shriveled away . <p> If I died here in the tub , Ellen would be a widow . She would n't know it till she came home . Knowing changes things . That 's why you have to remember , especially those who did nothing memorable , had no children , planted no trees , wrote no books , carved no stones , left nothing but lines in old telephone directories , on stones in suburban cemeteries . Where is Bert buried ? <p> What 's the sense of remembering the unmemorable ? Ca n't be helped , it 's involuntary . Why has n't evolution weeded it out ? What does it have to do with survival ? On our bedroom calendar , the November quotation ( in blue letters beside the ironic , ethereal face of Albert Einstein ) is : " What I value in life is quality rather than quantity , just as in Nature the overall principles represent a higher reality than does the single object . " But is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the singular jerk , or the genetic dictionary which formed him ? <p> " Do n't foul your own nest . " Uncle Bert . <p> That was what he told me 40-odd years ago back in New York . My parents and sister had taken off for a month , to Banff , Lake Louise , the Rockies , California . I was left in our apartment alone , very happy . I worked in the Paramount Films Sales Trainee Program on 43rd and Broadway . Weekends I went up with my cousin Andy  --  who had a car  --  to Quakerridge , my sister 's club . I played tennis , swam , ate hamburgers , and signed her name to the chits . One Saturday I saw Lynette Cloudaway lying by the pool . Two months before there 'd been a feature spread about her in Life , an Arkansas girl who 'd come to New York to be an actress . A photographer followed her around snapping pictures , at work , shopping , taking a bath , kissing her boyfriend goodnight . I 'd fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the flesh , by the pool . I could hardly speak . " May I sit here ? " <p> " Sure . " The smile I recognized , the throaty voice was new , devastating . <p> " I recognize you . " <p> " It 's me . " <p> " What are you doing here " <p> " I 'm with Will . " The guy she kissed goodnight . " Not exactly ' with , ' he 's playing golf . " <p> " Good . You can marry me . " <p> " What name will I have ? " <p> " Mrs. Larry Biel . " <p> " Set the date . " <p> We talked schools , jobs , where we lived , siblings , boy-and girlfriends , movies , books , songs , the works . How confident Will must be to leave this perfection by herself ; he did n't deserve her . <p> " Leave him . " <p> " I have n't had my swim yet . " <p> From the diving board , she jumped into the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beyond the flagstones , cigar-smokers played bridge . On umbrellaed lounges , bodies toasted . Lawns , blue sky , the rich , Lynette , a Jewish Fitzgerald scene ( the madness and cruelty evaporated ) . <p> Andy showed up . " Time to go . " <p> To Lynette : " I better not miss my ride . " <p> " You coming to the dance next week " <p> " I will now . If I have to walk . " <p> But I talked Andy into driving up again , white jacket and all . <p> Bare-shouldered , breasts under lace , Lynette was in another gear of beauty . On the dance floor , I kissed her ear , her cheek , her mouth . <p> " We should n't do that . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " I like it . And Will would see . " <p> " Let him , " I mouthed . Tough guy , who 'd melt at a leer . <p> " Let 's not dance for a half hour or so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But before she went back to Will I got her phone number . <p> Monday I called her office from mine . <p> " Lunch ? " <p> " Tomorrow . " <p> We met at Toffenetti 's , the glittery restaurant a block from the Paramount . I brought her the Viking Portable Fitzgerald , told her to read Tender Is the Night , and asked her to go out with me Saturday . <p> " I spend weekends with Will . " <p> Thursday night she called me at home where I was working off my passion for her by myself . " Will 's going fishing in the Adirondacks . I 've got to get my shoes fixed on 82nd and Amsterdam . I could come by your place after if you like . " <p> Would I like . I bought the first bottle of wine in my life , got whitefish and rye bread from Barney Greengrass , stacked records on the phonograph , and by noon was lathered out of my mind . When the doorbell rang , I nearly fainted . Again , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she I trembled too much to kiss her , could hardly talk . I managed to unscrew the bottle and trot out the sandwiches . We listened to Bing Crosby sing " Moonlight becomes you , it goes with your hair , you certainly know the right thing to wear . " I had to go to the bathroom . The phone rang . <p> " Shall I get it ? " <p> " Yes . " Proud to show whoever called what I had going here . <p> " It 's your Uncle Bert . He wants you to call him back . He sounded funny . " <p> " He 's a laugh a minute . What 's he want ? " <p> " He did n't say . Better call 'm . " <p> I did . <p> " Larry , " he said , " Do n't foul your own nest . " <p> Old sap . Foul . Even then I felt its comic pathos . Yet also sensed the stupid debris of something brought down in stone . " She 's my friend Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just going out . " <p> " All right , but do n't forget what I said . " <p> The condom I 'd gotten from the bathroom was ready , and I was getting there when the phone rang again . I did n't answer but thought , " The bastard 'll probably come up here . " It was nervousness talking . Despite my reading , despite six months ' fornicating with my first girl between rows of boxwood near the stadium at Chapel Hill , I knew nothing . ( Six years after Lynette , a week before Annie 's birth , I still believed children were born through the  --  enlarged  --  navel . ) <p> Do n't foul your own nest . You fouled it for me , you old jerk . Wednesday , Lynette called my office . " I have something to show you . " At lunch , she held out her left hand with the diamond ring . <p> I never saw her again . In person . Two years ago , Life published an anniversary issue , and there was Lynette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway street scene on her way to work . Ravishing , perfect , the girl of my life . Under the 40-year-old photograph was one of a crinkled granny : Lynette today . I tried to see the young Lynette in the old face ; could n't , not a molecule . A caption said that she and Will lived in Seattle near their grandchildren . I thought of writing her . But why ? I did n't want this grandmother . I wanted , still want , the girl who 'd come to the apartment . <p> Remembering acts on you , not you on it . <p> Why remember Bert That sterile neatness , that concupiscent propriety Immaculate in his blue suit , white silk handkerchief in the lapel pocket , gold tie and collar pins tucking him into himself , black silk socks taut in black garters , black shoes and hair gleaming with different fluids . So clean . His sister , my mother , another acolyte of cleanliness , was , in womanliness , beyond that . You would n't say she was immaculate . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Arms hooked , she and Bert strolled on Fifth Avenue , mirrored paragons , proud to be with each other , going into Saks and Sulka 's , Bert commandeering the service that was the chief source of his self-satisfaction . That and his Packard , his annuities , his neckties , his opinions , the blondes whose signed portraits  --  " To Bert with love , Jocelyn "  --  stood on his chifforobe . <p> I 'm unfair . I 'm repaying the resentment he felt for me as mother 's baby . There was decency and generosity in him . I needed $5,000 to put down on a house  --  it would be $50,000 today  --  and he gave it to me . Every winter , he sent Ellen and me a crate of grapefruit and oranges from Boca Raton . Is n't he in that generous gold fruit as much as in the Sulka ties and antique injunctions ( The last crate of it arrived a week after he keeled over in a Florida pool . ) <p> Driving downtown Tuesday , I recover from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years with a person , seeing her again after even a brief absence is like seeing her in closeup . Many unnoticed things are noticed , lines in the face , white in the hair , a rawness in the voice , dents and discolorations in the body . The least strange person in the world is , for an hour or two , a stranger . Perplexing , a little frightening . <p> Then the indispensability of the familiar returns , feelings of reliance , confidence , the identity and accepted disparity of views . There are habits of self-restraint as well as of self-expression . It 's one package . <p> I enjoy the grace and ease with which Ellen unpacks ; her reports on the trip . At supper it 's mostly about Annie , Chuck , and Anne . New problems , the resolution of old ones ; the death of the big oak across the street ; Chuck 's worry about the recession  --  though a pharmacist should be almost recession-proof ; the new Medicare regulations . <p> " Are things better with Bostorf ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie thinks is swindling him . <p> " He 's still trouble . At least , Annie 's worry about him is troublesome . " <p> We 've been worried about Chuck and Annie . They express their difficulties with each other obliquely ; Bostorf is one of the targets of this indirection . " And Anne " We worry a lot about the dangers to which so decent , open , and , we believe , innocent a girl can fall into in an American high school . For someone as much concerned as I am about the future of my seed , my fear about Anne 's fall into womanhood  --  the antique phrase that comes to me  --  is puzzling . <p> I tell her about Peter , omitting Metamorphosis . <p> Some afternoons are hard . After the Round Table , I play cards , or billiards , or read magazines , then walk back to the office and check the market close . I get going at 3:30 , before the rush hour , and am home by 4:15 . We eat at 6:00 in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal programs  --  people abusing , deceiving , molesting , kidnapping , killing : the human works . Then we read , watch programs , occasionally go out , or have friends in for bridge ; then bath and bed . Beside Ellen 's familiar warmth and fragrance , I go to sleep . Sometimes feelings bunch and we 're active ; afterward , we express gratitude to each other . <p> I do n't sleep as I used to , and often go to the guest room to read till my eyes tire . I 'm conscious of aches in the palms of my hands , my feet , my chest . Sometimes I read fear into these aches . After all , how much longer is there ? <p> I 've been a bystander , done nothing memorable . I 've had no real trouble , have lasted six-and-a-half decades , raised  --  whatever that means  --  what will live after me , and live in my paid-up house with someone I love . I 'm lucky . Still , now and then , it comes to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's speaking a language I ca n't follow . Fear gets so loud , I ca n't sleep . Once in a while , I go back to our room and hold on to Ellen . Sometimes this helps  --  like finding a dictionary  --  but sometimes it does n't . <p> Richard Stern is the author of a number of novels , including A Father 's Words , Natural Shocks , Other Men 's Daughters , and Golk , as well as short-story collections .
