When Tom Loeser started painting his furniture in the early 1980s , many in the field saw it as a radical act . In reaction to the arid intellectualism of minimalist and conceptual art , emotion , vulgarity , ornament and the figure had become increasingly evident in painting ; in architecture and design , the glitzy pastiche of postmodernism was at its fashionable apex . In studio furniture , however , the modernist credo of truth to materials was still predominant . Experimental form  --  mostly a heavy organicism  --  had cropped up throughout the 60s and 70s , but even in their most outlandish pieces furniture makers generally demonstrated a staunch allegiance to unadorned wood surfaces . As expressed in furniture by masters like Wharton Esherick , Sam Maloof and George Nakashima , a focus on wood 's inherent beauty symbolized the maker 's reverential partnership with walnut , maple and cherry-by extension , with nature-and became emblematic of a spiritual " way " which transcended object making . Beginning in the late 70s , postmodern designers thumbed their noses at this reverence for wood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glossy lacquers in riotous colors . The Memphis group 's unfettered approach to materials and dramatic use of color , in particular , were tremendously liberating for Loeser and many of his peers . " I do n't really like Memphis . I do n't like the pieces , but I like the attitude , " Loeser explains. * " I 'm really against the preciousness of materials . Another thing furniture has against it is that it takes a hell of a long time to make stuff , and the more hours you put into a piece , the tighter you get and the less willing you are to take risks . " Made to address these concerns , Cardboord Box #1 , 1 990 , also reveals the contradictions in Loeser 's work . It is a brilliantly ironic and poignant object , made of " lumber " glued-up of corrugated cardboard and colored papers and joined with precisely cut dovetails . In wood , the joints might last for centuries , but because of the " inherent vice " of its cheap materials , this piece will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a rather bald statement about preciousness by using these joints , his preoccupation with surface subverts it . The laminated paper boards , sawn across the " grain " to reveal intricate layers of fuzzy textures and soft colors , have a delicate , gentle beauty that subtly undoes the irony of the dovetails . Instead , this display of craftsmanship seems utterly appropriate , like the attention lavished on short-lived festival goods or fine cooking . Loeser romances wooden surfaces in the same way , and his freehand painting and carving speaks of labor and dedication , as against the studied vacuity of Memphis 's cheap , uniform patterning . A steady diet of relentless , self-conscious postmodernist kitsch  --  like reading a stack of tabloids , or watching a B-movie marathon  --  can induce a glutted nausea against which the only defense is a cynical bemusement . In contrast , Loeser 's furniture communicates a sort of refined goofiness that is genuine good fun and somehow completely in keeping with its high level of craftsmanship . Loeser 's appreciation for traditional workmanship was instilled through Boston University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1979 to 1982 . ( He also earned an M.F.A. from the University of Massachusetts , North Dartmouth , and is currently an assistant professor of art at the University of Wisconsin , Madison . ) " My training is in joinery , and it 's a little bit of a curse , because once you know the correct way to do things , you can never go back , " he notes . " At various times I 've tried to venture out and invent my own kind of systems , and there 's a pretty high failure rate with that . Those failures gjve you an increased respect for the traditional way of doing things . " While made the " correct way , " Loeser 's pieces do n't showcase technique . Generally , he tries to simplify construction wherever possible . The legs for his 1984 series called Earthquake Tables , for example , are made by skewering chunks of wood on rods . Part of that same year was devoted to a group of stick constructions  --  hall tables , a prickly etagere , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red/Blue Chair , 1918 . " I got to a point working with the sticks where 1 did n't have to plan everything and I could work intuitively , " Loeser says , a tactic that 's rare in furniture making . Most often , he carves with hand gouges and saws , enjoying the wobbly edges of the freehand stripes . But he is by no means a purist about hand tools . If a power grinder 's carving wheel will achieve the same unregulated surface , he 'll use it . Color is central to Loeser 's work , but it is n't primary . He treats each element separately , using color and pattern to elucidate his shapes  --  articulating edges , describing drawers and legs , picking out panels and knobs . In his early work , this strategy stressed the assemblage of parts over their unity , fueled ( for better and worse ) by Loeser 's desire to create lots of structural and pattern relationships . Many of the pieces made from 1982 to 1985 suffer from a fussy eccentricity and a reliance on squiggly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exceptions are the Mousehole Tables 1983 , in which expanses of beautifully figured tiger maple share equal footing with thin , informally striped and checkered supports , and the Monopoly Tables , which set islands of slick , pastel enamels afloat in a stick structure of stained oak or ash . In these , the texture and depth of wood grain relieve the flat surface shine of enamel and lacquer , clarifying their outline . This is really Loeser 's program : using paint , he isolates and describes individual parts to call attention to their relationships . His approach is investigatjve , and he often asks us to join him by offering pieces that either exaggerate their structure or require some work from the user . " People bring all sorts of expectations to furniture , and I like to shift that and make it a little more difficult , " he says . " I want them to have to work a little harder to figure out how to use the things . " The delightfully tricky folding chairs , 1982 , hang on the wall , and unfold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully articulated with color , openly challenge the viewer to " figure them out . " When hanging , it is n't obvious that they are chairs at all . The tripod , 1985 , and disjunctively stacked chest of drawers , 1989 , openly toy with our assumptions about case furniture , although their function is straightforward . His recent wall cabinets , begun in 1992 , remind me of the White Rabbit leading Alice into curiouser and curiouser situations . The doors of the Door sup 2 series open in opposite directions , revealing discrete segments of the interior , and the sliding wall cabinets are even more confounding . Their structures vary , limiting and complicating access to the interior : either the carcasses slide sideways over the drawers , or the drawers are set in long inner boxes that slide sideways within the carcass . With the carcass or inner box pulled left or right , some of the drawers will be misaligned or even hidden . It is impossible to open all of the drawers at the same time . There is a tradition of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Western case furniture , and Loeser 's wall cabinets ( especially Ten Little Boxes , 1992 , with its interchangeably faced drawers ) hint at this . But they are really more like puzzles , meant to disarm and engage the user . Loeser does n't want to fool you , he wants you to solve his riddles , which means getting involved and taking the cues issued by the cabinets ' inviting , oversized handles . It seems right , in this peculiar historical moment , for a studio furniture maker to pump up the interactions we have with chairs and cabinets . The wall cabinets reenergize the action of opening a drawer . This simple , self-referential gesture sums up the contemporary object maker 's concerns-what am I making ! why am I making it ? who am I making it for ? - quietly , almost in passing , without compromising the cabinets ' essential playfulness . Some of Loeser 's earlier designs are weighed down by cleverness . The folding chairs and wall cabinets actually thrive on it , but they are about problem solving ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to sitting , but they attend the challenge of collapsing furniture with great wit . The Earthquake Tables , in contrast , use the conceit of instability simply as an excuse to break up surfaces for patterning . Their shish-kebab legs and disrupted tops are structurally nonsensical , but the joke does n't stand up . The tripod chests of drawers are experiments in innovative form , but not much more than that , and ultimately they seem rather awkward and inconclusive . In these pieces , Loeser 's search for open , active form is waylaid by novelty . A group of lamps , 1987 , made in collaboration with the metalsmith Charles Crowley , teeter on the edge of caricature . The most successful are elegant , sharp twists on late 40s and early 50s design , but their exaggerated lines are slightly coy . They 'd be charming but overbearing party guests . Loeser 's best work resolves the relationship between surface and form by drawing on the economical outlines of 17th-century frame-and-panel chests and Shaker furniture . In the blanket chests , the Door sup 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tinkers with the articulation of feet and knobs , but keeps to the logic and proportion of traditional forms . His sliding wall cabinets are n't translated so directly , but their clean outline and long , low profile have a similar streamlining effect . Uncluttered shapes ground his electric color choices and the slight flickering quality of the freehand stripes he 's been carving recently . Loeser started carving " piecrust " edges on some of the earliest blanket chests , but lately he 's become obsessed with gouged stripes . " They 're such good organizers , and their relationships are so simple , " he says , and it 's true . One of his newest chests of drawers is painted with 32 colors , but the stripes make sense of it . These most recent pieces are similar to Shaker apothecary cabinets , with square drawers in repetitive stacks . Stripes define each drawer , outline the carcasses and gently flare to express the swollen feet . The stripes on Loeser 's black-and-white blanket chest , 1991 , send your eye zooming along the frame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but most of the striped pieces are less zippy , being punctuated by knobs or false tenons . The stripes are masterfully held in tension ; because they are so closely tied to the furniture 's structure , they never threaten to overwhelm its form . Loeser keeps his complex color relationships in check by using only one or two colors on each element , and working with related saturations . He now prefers milk paint , which wears much better than glossy enamels ; it also does n't mix as completely , creating soft flecks that are n't obvious from a distance . After painting the stripes , Loeser rubs them with steel wool to remove color from the ridges between each gouge . This reveals a thin strip of natural wood , usually mahogany or maple , interceding between the painted stripes . From across a room  --  or in reproduction  --  Loeser 's surfaces read as flat , graphic patterns , but up close you start to see crisp hints of wood and the fine granulation of the milk paint . This enticing diversity beckons you over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to investigate , to get inside the drawers and doors . Loeser has been refining his message . The recent work is relaxed , unself-conscious and exquisitely intelligent . It is dense with visual intrigue and beautifully made , and by this conveys deeply humane invitation .
