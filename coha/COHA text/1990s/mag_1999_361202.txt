Long famous for his lack of interest in male-female duets , Mark Morris has had a change of heart : The Argument , a witty , oddly melancholy study in relationships , puts three couples on stage , accompanied by Schumann 's Five Pieces in Folk Style , and shows them not getting along . Sometimes they grumble , sometimes they quarrel  --  and every once in a while they waltz , gently and sadly . Performed in New York City by a high-class cast , including Morris , cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Mikhail Baryshnikov , The Argument shows that the erstwhile bad boy of modern dance just keeps getting better . <P>  --  By Terry Teachout
