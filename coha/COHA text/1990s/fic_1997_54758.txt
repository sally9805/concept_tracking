Cool , smooth . Amy 's fingers rubbed the urn . Rubbed so hard a bit of her warmth rubbed off . Would her fingers ever feel warm again ? Or her heart ? <p> Not heavy . Did n't seem any heavier than when she bought it , as if David 's ashes were weightless . Probably floating around inside , immune to gravity , testing the lid , cracking effervescent jokes . Probably he was n't dead at all , and the joke was on her , who had let them burn him up , him lying so still and slack and pale . And cold . <p> No , he was dead all right . Cold just was n't David . No matter how jaw-cracking cold their bedroom was on the belowest zero nights of the year , no matter how icy were the feet . she stuck up against him  --  not on purpose , but reflexively  --  he was always warm . Like a furnace . Like a glowing , crackling fire . <p> Until something happened in his heart and the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . The fire went out and she lit it again . Burned him right up . The joke was so awful and so funny and so David that she let the laughter out , loud and long and unexpected , in the middle of the funeral . Laughter that did n't turn into tears . <p> It did turn heads , though . Every head in the place turned to face Amy and the urn , eyes concerned , shocked , maybe even appalled . Amy just kept laughing , almost dropping the urn that contained David , brushed stainless steel , vaguely spaceship-like in design . None of this brass , old-fashioned crap for him . Nothing that actually looked like a funeral urn . <p> David was the only person in the place capable of sharing the joke , and he could n't give her the old nudge and wink and that look that sent her over the edge into hilarity at the most inappropriate times  --  like now . " A private joke , " she said , out loud , hugging the urn , cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We apologize . " She adjusted her grip on the urn and addressed it . " Come along , dear , this party is dead . " More laughs , laughs , laughs . No one stopped her  --  them  --  from leaving , although several , especially her mother , considered it . She could tell from the expressions , the aborted movements , the eyes that went from " oh no " to " the poor thing , she does n't know what she 's doing " to " give her some time ... " <p> And before anyone could reconsider and decide that she was in no condition to be alone , Amy had whisked herself and her urn off to the car . <p> " Does n't a funeral procession usually consist of more than one car ? " she asked David . He of course said nothing , or , if he did , the answer did n't make it through the metal . She had buckled the urn firmly into the passenger 's seat . The tip of the screwed-on cap reached not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have to get you a booster seat , " she said . <p> It was almost another joke , and she almost laughed again , and then she was crying and swerving into oncoming traffic . A horn blared , and somebody 's brakes  --  hers ?  --  screeched . <p> She pulled over next to a Dunkin ' Donuts and wept until she was dried out , cried out . " Almost made it his and hers urns , " she said , " except I did n't have you to pick out a good one for me . Just my mother , and she probably would have had me bronzed like a bowling trophy  --  or maybe something in a nice lavender . " She could just picture her mother knitting matching urn cozies , with fuzzy pom-poms on top . The thought gave her a bleak smile , extra bleak because the only person she could have shared it with was toast . " Oh , David , " she said , and drove home . <p> At least she must have , because she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under one arm , fumbling in her black rip-stop nylon purse for her house key . Shit , she thought , blinking .. Maybe David drove home . I sure do n't remember doing it . <p> She did n't remember anything except that David was cold and dead and turned to ash . She pushed open the door  --  not having realized that she 'd found the key and turned it  --  and went in and set David on the server . <p> He looked marvelous there , quite the designer touch . " Maybe I 'll go into the decorating business , " she told the urn . " Coordinating the dearly departed with the early American living room set . " Or , in their case , with the futurized antiques . The server had belonged to her great-great aunt , who had probably started rolling in her grave ' when Amy and David got their hands on it . <p> Amy 's mom had tried to take it back when she found them staining it a sheer black that let the grain show through . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuschia and teal , picking out patterns in the grain and enhancing them with tiny brush strokes : an anorexic-looking figure with big feet , a girl with three eyes playing a warped violin with her hair , a cat with a tail that became the moon . " It 's obscene what you 're doing to Aunt Elma 's server , " she 'd said . " What would she think ? " <p> But that was their secret  --  they figured out what they thought , and went from there . How could dear , old , dead Aunt Elma 's thoughts have any influence on them , the living ? <p> How could the dead have any influence on the living ? For the first time , Amy knew the tenacious , sinewy grip of the dead . A two-way grip , for she was far from ready to let go herself . " What am I going to do with you ? " she asked the urn . <p> She could n't just leave it sitting on the server . It would unnerve her visitors , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't might think the urn was some sort of candy jar and sneak a handful of her sweetie . The living room would be just as bad , and the kitchen worse , and the bedroom ... David would appreciate the sentiment , but no one else would . Maybe if she disguised the urn with a pair of noseglasses .... <p> " Stop , " she yelled to herself . " It is n't funny . It is n't funny . It is n't funny . " <p> But she knew that already . <p> Hot tea , with milk . Did n't help . Did n't hurt , though . She drank it sitting in an antique rocker  --  one they 'd bought , because her mother flatly refused to give her any more of the family furniture . This time the sheer stain was deep violet and the gold accent painting picked out accidental letters in the grain . Mostly " s " and " c , " but on one of the arms there was a string that almost made sense . " Rixl . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger . Rixl . She and David had been working on the definition . An uninterrupted thought tree . Or maybe eat with your fingers at a fancy restaurant . He leaned toward verbing it , while she was almost sure it was a noun . Noun or verb , though , it did n't seem to tell her where to put David . <p> She drained the mug , rocking far back , so her hair brushed the ficus . Benjamin , they called him , a not-very-creative derivation of ficus Benjamina . Benjamin was their pet  --  even to shedding extravagantly on the charcoal gray carpet . David had taken to counting each day 's fallen total . The record was twenty-seven leaves . <p> There were many more than that surrounding the brown plastic pot now . Since David died , she had n't picked up so much as a leaf . Benjamin was probably going to die soon , too , since he was seriously underpotted . That had been on the agenda for last weekend . And instead , black joke number thirty-two , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fallen leaves , hands strangling Benjamin 's trunk , shaking the slender tree violently . Leaves showered down on her and the carpet and the rocking chair . <p> When she stopped , Benjamin wobbled loosely in his pot . A good half of his leaves and the top third of the potting soil littered the floor . Amy brushed potting soil from her black pants with shaking hands . " I 'm sorry , Benjamin , " she whispered . Brilliant maneuver ; husband dies , kill the pet . <p> She lugged Benjamin out onto the deck , leaving a trail of leaves and dirt . The new , larger pot and a couple bags of potting soil were in the laundry room , next to a pile of dirty clothes  --  David 's favorite shirt , which seemed to cycle through every load , straggled across the top . <p> Amy picked up the shirt and clenched the fabric , compressing it to the density of lead or the interior of a neutron star  --  or death . David 's scent . David 's residue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of a spaghetti sauce stain . She made her fingers loosen , with a terrible effort , and spread the shirt on the top of the dryer . She just looked at it for a moment that seemed like a year , and then she folded it carefully and set it on the shelf beside the light bulbs . <p> The bags of soil and the pot were not really heavy , but folding the shin had taken some essential energy from her . Her arms and legs and every other part of her felt drained , detached . But she had to do something , so she loaded up and went to the deck , mildly surprised when she arrived without dropping anything . <p> Benjamin looked awful . " I 'm so sorry , " she said . She scooped up a couple handfuls of large gravel from around the base of a nearby aspen and put it in the bottom of the new pot for drainage . Then she ripped open one of the bags and poured it in , scooping out a hollow in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably broken many of his roots , but there was nothing she could do about that now . Nothing but be extra gentle as she lifted him from the pot and set him in the hollow , listing to one side until she could fill in the sides with stabilizing soil . <p> The second bag turned out to be not quite enough . " Damn it , David , " she said , her breath coming hard against the back of her teeth . " Why did n't you get three stupid bags ? " <p> She looked through the sliding glass door . The edge of the server was just barely visible around the corner , but she could n't see the urn . And then she could n't see much of anything through the liquid that coated her eyes . Colors and shapes blurred together in swirls like the painted details on their antiques . <p> After a long time , Amy realized that she was crouched , her nose running , in front of the server , with David 's urn held tight to her chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , her voice raw from weeping . <p> The urn had warmed from her prolonged contact . The top and sides were streaked with tears . " Sorry , " she said , wiping the worst of the tears from the smooth silver surface with the tail of her black shirt . <p> Black was one of Amy 's regular wardrobe staples , so she had n't needed to buy new clothes for the funeral , just choose the nicest of her black pants and shirts  --  and argue with her mother over the suitability of wearing black Reebok aerobic shoes to a funeral . <p> " Do n't you think a nice black dress would be better ? " her mother had asked . " I could pick you up some shoes , too . Size six , is n't it ? " <p> " No . " <p> Her mother 's eyebrows rose . " Really ? I was sure you wore a six . " <p> " No , I do n't want any stupid black dress and uncomfortable shoes . Just leave me alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Well , you are n't . " <p> " It 's just that you are n't making very good decisions right now and  --  " <p> Amy had burst at that point . " Shut up . I lost my husband , not my brain . I will wear what I want to wear . " <p> " Fine , " said her mother , lips tight . " Go to the funeral looking like a cat burglar . " She 'd left then , angry and hurt , leaving Amy to murmur to the silence . " Size six is right . Sorry . " <p> Now she knelt in her cat burglar clothes , although probably most cat burglars were n't covered with tears and dirt , and polished the urn . <p> The circular polishing movements loosened the lid . After a hesitation , she unscrewed it all the way and looked inside . Powdered and chunky , grayish white . David 's remains felt gritty on her fingers . Darker spots appeared , and she realized she was crying again , watering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain . Good thing there was nothing planted here . <p> Planted . Planted . Planted . Amy 's hands grasped the urn carefully and carried it to the deck . Amy 's hands tilted it and poured David in a thin stream around Benjamin 's trunk . Amy 's hands gently mixed him into the loose soil . <p> When David was integrated with the dirt and vermiculite , Amy took the urn over to the spigot , filling it about halfway with water . She swirled it carefully to clean the last dust of him from the sides , and poured it into the new pot . " Damn , " she said then , realizing she should have moved the plant back in , first , before it was heavy with water . <p> Nothing to be done about that now , though . She lugged it into place behind the rocker , only just managing not to slop muddy water onto the carpet . <p> " There you go , Ben-David , " she whispered , letting her fingers trail down the trunk , touch a brown-edged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more thing to do , one more touch that would have tickled the dear departed . <p> When her mother came , Amy was half asleep in the rocking chair . The urn , minus its top , sat on the cherry coffee table they had painted with tiny , psychedelic cherries , filled with some of the flowers friends had sent when David died . <p> For some time , it appeared that Ben-David was doomed . Repotting , after all , was in itself a traumatic event for a plant . Add the shaking and attempted strangulation ... Leaves fell like dry rain . <p> Amy bought a hygrometer , not trusting herself . " I 'd probably water you to death , " she told Ben-David , bending over the pot clutching the hygrometer 's slender metal spike . " Do n't worry , this should n't hurt much . " <p> Still wearing all black clothes that hung on a newly slender figure . " The Dead Spouse Diet , " she said to a friend who had complimented her on losing weight . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the model agencies are wooing you . " Another comment unappreciated . Black clothes , black humor , bleak heart . <p> Days passed , weeks , and she began to feel less as if she had a metal spike stuck through her . And new leaves crept to the tips of Ben-David 's branches and flared green . <p> She talked to Ben-David all the time , telling it/him/them about her latest desktop publishing project  --  " This brochure for a cryonics firm - you know , the people that freeze you when you die so in the future they can cure your whatever and bring you back to life . People are really getting weird . We should have taken a bigger life insurance policy out on you . Then I would only take on sensible jobs , like designing resumes for cats who are going through a midlife career change . " About her mother 's new hobby , matchmaking  --  " She thinks I ought to spend time with someone who 's alive . " About whatever " I still think rixl is a noun . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite . Joyful disorientation , on steroids . " <p> She was sitting in the rocking chair with her feet up on the cherry table . The urn held a feathery arrangement of dried grass now , with one magenta silk orchid as a focal point . Ben-David 's leaves caressed her face when she leaned back . " Joyful disorientation , on steroids , " she said again . " I think that might be it . What do you think ? " <p> Ben-David , as usual , said nothing . <p> " I will take your silence as an assent , " she said . <p> Ben-David dropped two leaves on her forehead . <p> Amy 's eyes popped open . She twisted sideways in the chair , one leg over the arm , so she could look at the ficus . It was hardly shedding at all these days  --  it seemed awfully coincidental that two leaves had just happened to fall directly on her head just as she was talking to it , and taking advantage of its silence in the conversation . Communication ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that again , " she said . " A controlled experiment . If you agree with me that rixl is a noun meaning joyful disorientation , on steroids , drop one leaf . If you disagree , drop two leaves . If you are just a dumb plant , do n't do anything . " This was stupid , ridiculous , ludicrous  --  ludicrous on steroids  --  but her breath came fast and shallow . She held her open hand under one the graceful branches . <p> Two leaves dropped into her palm . <p> Her fingers closed over them . " Are you really there ? " she whispered . " One leaf for yes , two for no . " <p> A single leaf twirled to the floor . <p> Amy 's thoughts twirled in her head . It was n't possible she was cracking up ohmigod he was here . " Oh , David , " she said , stroking the smooth trunk with shaky fingers . " If you 're not there and this is some sort of random occurrence I will be so mad at you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you anyway , for dying like this , " and she meant it , " and leaving me alone with all these boring people who have plain brown furniture and do n't talk to their plants . " <p> It was n't easy to talk to a plant . Rather , that part was easy ; what was tricky was getting the plant to talk back . Yes and no questions depended too much on the psychic abilities of the talker . An alphabet code  --  with one leaf for " a " and two for " b , " etcetera , would have the poor tree denuded halfway through the first message , especially if it was a reminiscence about the time they went to the zoo and fed the wildebeests . <p> A yes-and-no alphabet combination worked , kind of , with Amy going through the alphabet and Ben-David dropping a leaf when she got to the right letter , but it took forever , especially if a leaf was stubborn and did n't fall until the appropriate letter was past . Then there was the problem of where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It made a person feel pretty stupid , Amy discovered , to have an argument with a plant . " ' I ' ? How could it possibly be ' I ' ? The last two letters were ' O ' and ' U. ' Tell me one word that starts with ' oui . ' " A sudden thought . " Are you spelling , " oui , " as in French ? " <p> Two leaves , their standard signal for no . Amy sighed . " A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H , I , J  --  " a leaf . " ' J ' ? ' OUIJ  --  " Her mouth dropped open . " I get it . I 'm an idiot . Maybe you are too , because I do n't see how you can use a Ouija board without fingers , but what the hell . I 'll go crazy if we keep this up . " She saluted Ben-David . " I 'm off to Tar-zhay , since my mother would never let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore I do n't have one conveniently stashed in the attic . I should get Letterman 's job . I seem to talk in monologues now , since you 're not holding up your end of the conversation . " <p> She had n't been out much lately , just the post office and a few clients and brunch with friends the previous Sunday . ( It was hard not to tell them , but then she 'd never been fond of straight jackets , so she refrained . ) Target seemed so gloriously mundane that it gave her a light-headed feeling to be there with the intent to purchase a Ouija board for communicating with her dead husband who was now embodied in their pet tree . <p> Ouija boards were cheap . Of course , she thought , perusing the other " games . " They did n't have interactive videos or electronic displays . They did n't need batteries . <p> Just fingers , which seemed like a problem to her , but hey , it was David 's life insurance money : if he wanted to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision . <p> At home , she set the board next to Ben-David 's pot and placed her fingers on the planchette . " Okay , " she said . " Ready when you are . " Nothing happened for a moment and then the planchette slid under her quivering fingers , crashed into the side of the board , and stopped . <p> Ben-David dropped a single leaf , which drifted down and fell on the carpet , half an inch from the board . <p> " I get it , " Amy shouted . She tossed the hokey little plastic pointer to the side and lifted the board until it was only a couple of inches below Ben-David 's leafiest branch . A leaf fell on " D , " then another on " A. " " V. " " **25;1246;TOOLONG . " <p> " Yes ! Docking is completed . We have lift-off . Beam me up , Scotty ! We are communicating ! " <p> It was not perfect . Amy 's arms grew tired , holding the board up close enough so the drift of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory for the order of the letters , since her hands were n't available for writing , and if Ben-David went fast or the message was long , sometimes she screwed up . She always won arguments , though , by taking the board away whenever she got irritated . <p> She tried setting the board on the low cherry table but that was not significantly better than having it on the floor . " We need height , " she told Ben-David . " I do n't think even the dining room table would do . Maybe one of those cafe tables that you need stools to sit at ... I bet the place on Campbell Street would have something . " The pain that had been retreating over these last weeks hit her full force . David was not going to pull up Benjamin 's roots and walk into Antiqua  --  or any place else  --  with her ever again . <p> She stared at the ficus tree with tear-blurred eyes , the delicate branch tips and curled-edge leaves fuzzing into amorphous green . Anger touched her again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Do n't  --  " Do n't what ? Have any wild parties without me ? Go anywhere ? <p> That was it , she realized . Even in the midst of the odd logistics of holding a two-way conversation with a plant , she was desperately afraid that David 's " mission " or whatever the hell you might call it , would be fulfilled and he would leave her . Again . For good . <p> " Do n't overdo it on the carbon dioxide , " she finished lightly . " I 'll be back soon . " She automatically blew a kiss in Ben-David 's direction , exactly as she would have sent one toward her husband before he died . Not for the first time , she began to worry that she was seriously deranged . <p> Working on the marble-topped cafe table , with its scarred mahogany legs , was painful and soothing at the same time . The even strokes painting on the caustic stripping solution , watching old varnish bubble . The fumes stung her eyes , gave her an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job anyway , too much for David 's hypersensitive nose . The gritty work of sandpaper and steel wool . Frustration built in quickly , only there was no patient David to hand it off to after the first few strokes . She was doing this for him , not with him . And when she consulted with him on the colors , once the thing was denuded , he simply wrote " all . " <p> " That 's helpful , " she muttered , wiping sweat from her forehead with a grimy hand . Her clothes were stippled with wood dust , more grayish-brown than black . Greasy hair straggled out from under her bandana . Two clients had been calling , polite but concerned  --  everyone , including her mother , had been polite but concerned with her lately , giving new fuel to the seriously deranged possibility  --  wondering how she was coming on their projects . " A little hardware problems , " she 'd told them . " Should be up and running soon . " She could n't tell them the hardware problem she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the plant had given her carte blanche with color . <p> " All colors . Great  --  " she stopped . " A rainbow . David , you 're a genius . " She clattered downstairs and brought up all the leftover stains and paints . But how to put it on ? David had been the detail man , accurate with a fine-haired brush . She was the splash and slosh type herself . If only you could do batik on furniture , or tie dye . Ah ! <p> She clattered down again and came up with a huge ball of every string  --  of whatever dimension and composition  --  that had ever entered the house , knotted together and rolled by David the packrat , who had insisted that someday they might need four thousand feet of string for who knew what . She began wrapping the legs in strange spirals , leaving parts of the wood bare , staining , rewrapping in a slightly different pattern , using another color . <p> It took days . <p> Some strings she did n't take off , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent part under the clear lacquer finish . She splashed stains across the marble top as well , drops and drips and dribbles , pools that she let soak in vividly and completely , and others that she wiped up in seconds , barely tinting the white surface with its natural black and gray pattern . It was stupid , she knew , to be so obsessive about color when the only really important thing about the table was its height , but then the whole thing was stupid . Insane . Bizarre . <p> As soon as the marble was dry , she set the Ouija board on top of it and moved it directly below Ben-David 's branches . The first word spelled out by falling leaves was " STINKS . " <p> Amy laughed . " It does , does n't it ? I did n't know plants had noses . " She opened the sliding glass door wider and slid up all the dining room windows for cross ventilation . What she had just said tickled her brain . Plants did n't have noses , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were taking in carbon dioxide , but how did Ben-David see ? It took some sort of visual sense to distinguish the letters to drop leaves on . And how did a plant hear her voice ? Her own private theory on the fact that plants thrived when people talked to them was that they liked the extra CO2 from all the hot air , that it did n't matter what you said or the tone you said it in . <p> There was something dangerous and important in this line of speculation , and she purposefully put it out of her mind . " That better ? " she asked . <p> A leaf fell on " YES . " <p> For several days , Amy spent most of her time on a stool pulled up next to the rainbow table , talking with her dead husband until her butt was sore and Ben-David had lost most of his leaves . Being dead was like being stuck in a snowdrift , David told her , only not knowing if you 'd ever get out . She shared all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch tips quiver with silent mirth . <p> On Monday , Donna from Piece-of-Cake called , asking again about the conference brochure . She could apparently tell from Amy 's awkwardness that not only was it not done , it had n't even been started . Her friendly voice hardened . " If you 're not going to get it done , " she said , " I do n't want bogus assurances . Just tell me and I 'll get someone else . " <p> Amy 's face heated up . " I 'll have it for you by Friday , camera ready . Is that soon enough ? " <p> " I guess it will have to be . See you on Friday then . " Click . <p> Amy set her phone down just as firmly . " Do n't they know I 'm trying , " she hissed , knowing even as she said it that it was a lie . And how could they know , even if she was , because the only " person " she had talked to lately was a disembodied dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from her thoughts , uncomfortably aware that they were leading her toward painful knowledge . <p> She looked toward Ben-David . " Well , it 's off to the salt mines , " she said . " Unless you want to get a job in a lobby somewhere . " She scooted the haunted ficus into her study . The computer keys were dusty , tangible proof that she 'd been neglecting her job . She powered up her system with a flick of a rainbow-stained finger and sat down . <p> It took a few minutes to get her mind into work mode , but then the brochure started coming together . She borrowed the rainbow idea from Ben-David 's table and drenched the borders with wild swirls of color ; not like anything that Piece-of-Cake had used before but not incongruous with their image . She played with different fonts until she had just the right one , blew up the conference title into 102 point type that took it from one margin to the other at a diagonal and selected rainbow swirl as the font fill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given it a heavy black outline . <p> When she finally looked up to check the clock , four hours had passed . " I 'm sorry , " she said to Ben-David . " I guess I just got lost in my work . And poor you sitting there without a kind word tossed your way . " <p> It was n't exactly easy for a plant to get someone 's attention unless it was close enough to rain leaves down on the someone . Amy tried it the next day while working on text lay-out , and it drove her crazy to have the ficus breathing down her neck and the rainbow table scooted up next to the printer . Occasionally , Benjamin  --  not David  --  dropped random leaves which meant nothing other than " I am a ficus . I am shedding . " It was impossible to tell the difference without . getting into Ouija talk , which interrupted the flow of ideas . And even when it was David , the conversations chopped up her work day . <p> On Wednesday , she moved Ben-David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get this done , " she said . <p> David did n't drop a leaf . <p> She delivered the completed brochure late Thursday afternoon , after printing i t out at LaserWorks Printing . Her business was n't big enough yet to afford a color laser printer . That was on the agenda for next year . Had been anyway , before David 's death . It still could be , if she got her act together and did n't lose all her clients . " Sorry , " she told Donna , who wore three jade earrings in one ear and a single diamond post in the other . " I have n't been the best since  --  " Since David died ? Or since he came back as a plant ? <p> Fortunately , she did n't have to finish the sentence . Donna gave her hand a quick squeeze . " Well , you 're back on track now with this gorgeous piece of work . You 're so creative . " That was a compliment coming from someone who regularly had at least three distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it were meant to go together . <p> " Getting there , anyway , " said Amy . " Call me the next time you need something done . " <p> On the way home , she pulled in at The Blue Moo to have a drink . Only one , since her designated driver  --  David hardly ever drank  --  was now potted . Bitterness welled up inside her , hardly the reaction she 'd expected after turning in a dynamite project . She wanted to have another drink , a whole slew of them , enough to float home , but her conscience would n't let her . Nothing would induce her to drive drunk and risk killing someone . Another small voice within her said , " Dope , that 's what cabs are for . " <p> She got very drunk . <p> Not falling down . Not **28;1273;TOOLONG . Not stupidly libidinous . Just drunk . Contemplative . Maudlin . The whole " why 'd you have to die and what 's going to happen to us now that you 're a goddamn plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a tree . Or not making love to anyone ever again . Or letting go of David . All of which made her very confused , which was not surprising , given the toxic condition of her synapses . <p> The bartender gently suggested he call her a cab when she was hunched over the counter , crying in her beer , like a character in a country song . " Okay , " she said , very carefully hauling herself to her feet . " That 's a very good idea . A very good idea . " She started to recite her address . <p> " Do n't tell me , " he said hastily . " Tell the cab driver . " <p> By the time the cab came , some time later , the cool outside air had sobered her up a tiny bit , but certainly not enough to drive . <p> " Honey , I 'm home , " she said , after paying the cab driver and fighting with the key for a while . Ben-David stood silently in the dark living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked herself , starting to cry again . She was too drunk to even attempt to read the leaf answer . Unsteadily , she went down the hall to their  --  her , dammit  --  bed . <p> Waking up in the morning was a bit of a trick . At times like this , Amy hated what they 'd done to the massive oak headboard . Waves of blue in shades from green to gray followed the grain of the wood , a wild and chaotic ocean that seemed to revolve about several points when one was hung over . She groaned and closed her eyes and tried again later . <p> After several such laters , she straggled out to the living room and lay down on the floor near Ben-David . Even the thought of the rocker made her queasy . She did n't look at the multi-colored table either , staring instead up at the sparse canopy of leaves . The few days she 'd spent intensively working had not been enough to replenish the ficus . " We 've been talking too much , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She did n't say anything for quite a while , sorting slowly through her thoughts . " Do n't answer , " she said . " I just want to say this first . You said death was like being stuck in a snowdrift . Maybe that 's because you are stuck . Only you 're not stuck , you just think you are . I just think you are . I mean , how could you hear and see me if you were really living through Benjamin ? It 's not like he 's got eyes and ears . That 's you . I think you just think you 're tied in with Benjamin . Your ashes are , but I bet you could go and  --  and do whatever dead people do . I could get a life and you could get a death . " <p> Two leaves fell right in her face . <p> " I said to let me finish . " Her voice caught in her throat . " All we 're going to do this way is kill Benjamin . I feel bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my mother going to think if I start showing up at family reunions with a ficus tree ? What 's she going to have for grandkids ? Saplings ? I think you should go be dead somewhere else . Get on with your death . I love you , but I do n't think it 's supposed to be this way . " She closed her eyes for a few seconds to force the tears back inside , then she rolled over onto her knees and got up to brush the Ouija board clear of fallen leaves . " Okay , you can talk now . " <p> Nothing . Not a leaf . Panic squeezed her lungs . She had n't meant go without saying goodbye or arguing about it or something . But he was just thinking or something , because after a minute , leaves began to fall , slowly . <p> " CLICHE . BUT YOURE RIGHT . RIXL . " <p> " What the hell does that mean ? " she asked . <p> " YOU DECIDE , " was the answer . " BYE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She just stood for a long time , holding the trunk of the ficus with the tips of her fingers . Rixl . Definitely a noun . I 'll always remember you but I wo n't let it destroy , me . On steroids . And what did he mean about checking back later ? Was he going on vacation ? They never had seen the Grand Canyon or Hawaii or  --  lots of places David would n't need airfare to see now . " Rixl , babe , " she said . <p> She made the front of her sleep shirt into a pouch and gathered the fallen leaves . Letters . Words . Messages from the dead . To be kept on the shelf in the laundry room with David 's unwashed favorite shirt . While he was gallivanting about and she was figuring out how to be alive all by herself . <p> Rixl . She guessed it could be a verb after all . <p> <p> <p> By Laurel Winter <p> Laurel Winter is evolving into one of our best writers of short fantastic fiction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most recent being " The Blood Harp " in our May 1996 issue <p> " David 's Ashes " is a change of pace for her  --  a sweet meditation on life , love , and the meaning of ever-after . <p>
