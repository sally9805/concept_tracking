<p> Although Americans are sophisticated and discerning shoppers , they tend to be careless and uninformed investors . Ironically , most people spend more time choosing their refrigerator and car than they do figuring out how to invest their life savings . As a broker , I saw more money invested in stocks based on tips , rumors , and casual advice than most of us will earn in a lifetime . <p> In a November 1994 article in Consumers ' Research , Peter Lynch , former manager of the stellar-performing Fidelity Magellan fund , stressed the importance of knowing what you invest in . He meant that in two senses : know whether the stock is a good value and know the basic business and industry the company is in . Most people can tell if Ben and Jerry 's makes the best ice cream around but do n't know if Grumman manufactures good fighter jets ( unless , of course , they are in the military or airline industry  --  then they have an edge ) . Therefore , Lynch recommends staying clear of Grumman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business . If you were going to become a part owner of Tony 's Pizza on Main Street , you 'd want to make sure you understood the operation . Is Domino 's moving in next door ? Has Tony run up a lot of debt ? <p> You do n't need a business degree to ask the right questions , but finding out what the experts look for can only help . Start by reading good books on how to invest . Since there are almost as many books on investing as there are publicly traded stocks , where should you start ? Below are some books that offer time-tested advice that rings true to me after a dozen years ' investing ( including three years as a broker overseeing $17 million ) and plenty of mistakes learned the expensive way . <p> Probably the best book to start with is Peter Lynch 's One Up On Wall Street : How to Use What You Already Know to Make Money in the Market ( $12.95 , Penguin ) . In a jargon-free and entertaining style , Lynch and co-author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigating excellent companies you come across in your business or shopping life . <p> Lynch ( who wrote the book when he was still a fund manager ) is convinced that the small investor can outperform " the smart money . " Performance pressures and restrictions against investing in small companies force most institutional investors and money managers to be herd-followers and lag the market averages . Most money managers wo n't buy Wal-Mart stock until it has already opened at least 150 stores . If you , however , happened to have a Wal-Mart in your area before Sam Walton became a household name , you could have easily bought into a high-growth business before the crowds . <p> Again and again , Mr. Lynch advises you to avoid the latest computer gadget and stick with what you know . If you 're in the shoe business , you know which shoes are hot , which sell the best consistently over time , and which offer the best value .

You also have to determine whether the company 's stock is a good value . You may have used America Online and feel confident business on the information super-highway will expand , but the run-up in America Online stock may already reflect good news for years to come . The stock may continue to soar if it exceeds analysts ' expectations , but if earnings growth does n't continue , be prepared for free-fall drops . <p> In a chapter ? titled " Some Famous Numbers , " Lynch gives clear explanations of such important financial benchmarks as price/earnings ( P/E ) ratio , company debt , inventories , and book value . He feels it takes only " a couple of hours " of research to determine if a stock is worth buying . <p> While One Up on Wall Street is a wise and complete guide to stock investing , it does n't include a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( even if you follow Lynch 's advice to ignore macroeconomics , you may want to know what The Wall Street Journal is referring to ) . A good book for filling in those details is Stock Market Primer ( $13.99 , Warner Books ) by Claude N. Rosenberg . <p> In addition to giving clear explanations of how the stock market works , how to make the most of the financial pages , and how to understand a company 's financial statement , Stock Market Primer provides much of the sound , level-headed advice Lynch does . If you follow Rosenberg 's 17 " stock market commandments "  --  such as " Do not make hasty , emotional decisions about buying and selling stocks " and " Do not concern yourself as much with the market in general as with the outlook for individual stocks "  --  the book will prove itself in be worth its weight in gold many times over . ( If only I 'd read it sooner . ) <p> A Random Walk Down Wall Street ( $14.95 , Norton ) by Princeton professor of finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its skeptical wit as its advice . The random-walk theory states that no one can beat the market averages because expectations about a company 's future prospects are already built into the price of the stock . Predicting changes to those expectations that are more accurate than those of other stock watchers is difficult at best because " forecasting the future is an inherently treacherous occupation . " <p> Despite his sympathies for the random-walk theory , Malkeil ultimately admits that the market is n't totally efficient . The emotional extremes of crowds create both over- and under-valued stock prices . ( He does n't address the kind of situation that Lynch recommends , which is buying companies that are not followed by many analysts . ) Like Lynch and Rosenberg , Malkeil strongly advises staying away from the much touted growth stocks that everyone seems to be talking about . He presents lower-risk/higher-return strategies , such as buying only companies that have had five years of consistent earnings growth and whose P/E ratio is lower than its earnings growth rate . He admiringly presents Windsor Fund manager John Neff 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividend yield are twice the stock 's P/E ratio . <p> After acknowledging the appeal of choosing your own stocks , Malkeil thinks most investors should put their money in index funds . Historically , the stock averages have provided a better rate of return than other investments , such as real estate or gold . Index funds are passively managed mutual funds that are set up to match the various market averages ( such as the S &P; 500 ) . Index fund managers do minimal trading , which usually means management fees and commissions costs are low ( in the case of Vanguard 's S &P; 500 fund the management fee is only .19% ) . These reduced costs mean index funds outperform the vast majority of actively traded mutual funds  --  with reduced tax liability for the investor to boot . ( For more on investing in index funds , see " An Easy Investment Choice : Index Funds , " CR , January 1993 . ) <p> Although reading all the investment books in the world can never replace the actual experience of evaluating , buying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Most Widely Held Investment Axioms Explained , Examined , and Exposed ( $18.95 , Probus Publishing ) by Michael D. Sheimo will help you avoid mistakes that most rookie investors are prone to make . Some valuable reminders include : " Look for Insider Trading " and " Let the Winners Run . " <p> Insider trading refers to executives and officers of a company buying their own stock . The logic is that if the people who know the company and business best have enough confidence to buy the stock for their own account , then you should too . Sheimo confirms that this widely held axiom is good advice and then further qualifies what is the best kind of insider buying to look for . He points out , for instance , that more than one top executive must be buying for it to be significant and you should only pay attention to large purchases ( more than 5% of current holdings ) made in the open market . An executive converting stock options , which will be reported in publications such as Value Line , should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let the Winners Run , " there is a strong temptation for new investors to be so delighted with a profit that they grab a small one without letting a sound investment decision fully develop . Again , keep in mind you 're investing in a business . Good companies can continue to grow for a long time . If the business is developing as you hoped and expected , hold on to your stake  --  even if it seems momentarily overpriced . ( If the stock is wildly overpriced , then you may need to reevaluate . ) <p> If you 've plowed through two or more of the above books and are ready to get serious about analyzing companies , you need a copy of Graham and Dodd 's Security Analysis ( $59.95 , McGraw Hill ) . Security Analysis has been the training manual for professional investors for half a century . Benjamin Graham 's disciples include the legendary investor Warren Buffett and mutual fund empire-builder Sir John Templeton . <p> The basic tenet of the book is that if a company 's market capitalization ( share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly less than its liquidation value ( i.e. , if the company were sold as a private business or broken into parts and sold ) then the stock is a good investment . Over time , the efficiency of the market will recognize the imbalance and push up the stock price . <p> While this theory has been proven to be a sound one for patient and thorough investors , and the concepts presented in it are good for all investors to know , there are some caveats . For one , the book is slow going . For another , following all of Graham 's and Dodd 's techniques is so time-consuming that it 's only practical for the professional investor who crunches numbers all day . And lastly , the value investing approach Graham pioneered now has so many followers that it is much more difficult to find unrecognized values than it used to be . <p> Naturally , following the advice of the above books wo n't guarantee you 'll invest in winners and avoid losers , but it should tilt the odds in your favor .
