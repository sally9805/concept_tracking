The grisly mix of fertilizer and hatred that detonated in Oklahoma City last week appears to provide stark evidence of something many Americans have denied : the existence of paranoid , violent thinking within our borders . Just what are the tenets of this thinking ? And did they figure in last year 's election returns ? <P> Like other political movements before it , the radical right in America today has its extremist component , which plainly was a force in the 1994 elections . For instance , George Nethercutt , the giant-slayer Congressman who knocked off former House Speaker Tom Foley in Washington State , drew strength from radio shows where callers talked about sightings of black helicopters and U.N . plans to set up a secret compound in the state . In neighboring Idaho , Helen Chenoweth upended an environmentalist Democratic incumbent in part by saying that the only endangered species was the " white Anglo-Saxon male . " <P> These politicians and others drew on widespread mistrust and even hatred of government power in Western and rural areas . Their coalition included well-known elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy theorists influenced by the John Birch Society 's fear of one-world government ; Second Amendment activists ( mostly men ) for whom guns are an important part of an independent way of life ; self-reliant types who resent a Federal Government that seems to favor grizzly bears and wolves over humans on government land . <P> But this is common stuff in many parts of the country . It is several giant steps from this movement to the extremist-fringe thinking that seems to have bred the Oklahoma City bombing . That frame of mind appeals to a hard-bitten and alienated segment of society that has found a voice lately in millennial movements like the Christian Patriots and the state " militias , " largely in the Middle West and West . The militias may be  --  as they strongly claim to be-composed largely of yeoman states '  --  righters energized over the threat to the Second Amendment . But they have also fostered viciously antigovernment thinking that if followed to its logical end leads in one direction : armed uprising . <P> Perhaps the most belligerent militia is the Militia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noxon . " This is probably where the war is going to begin , right here in Montana , " a member who refused to be identified told the bbc last year . " We 've got a lot more bullets than they do . " <P> John Trochmann , the militia 's cofounder , distributes literature that would terrify many people . It features photographs of Soviet jeeps said to be on American soil . Russian troops are going to arrive here as part of an international police force , contends Trochmann 's newsletter , Taking Aim . Our own government , the literature asserts , is guilty of " treason , " is secretly building concentration camps and is planning nine zones to replace the lower 48 states  --  a partition plan that the Militia of Montana asserts was spelled out in an illustration on the back of Kix cereal boxes last year . Martial law is inevitable . And Trochmann endorses the prediction that sometime in the next century , " America 's white population will perish . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
