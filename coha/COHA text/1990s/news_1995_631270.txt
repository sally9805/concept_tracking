<p> Catch a glimpse of her at the farmers market on the grounds of the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison , and you 'd think she was a holdover flower child , her hair braided and streaked with gray , a lumpy brocade satchel slung across her gamin-thin back . <p> Observe her more closely and you 'll notice she tows a red wagon . Within minutes , she fills it to overflowing . <p> Tag along and you hear her greet many farmers by name . She stocks the cart with baby bok choy , heirloom tomatoes , lemongrass , flowers , squashes , peppers and beans . There 's talk about putting up plum jam . <p> Is she feeding a commune or does she have 11 children back on the farm ? <p> Neither . She feeds the guests of her 60-seat restaurant . Sublimely . <p> Meet Odessa Piper , proprietor and chef of L'Etoile , a one-of-a-kind restaurant serving meals that are Midwestern because of the ingredients that go into them , but world-class in their level of sophistication . <p> L'Etoile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cachet to succeed , offers the best seats in the city ( on the Square , overlooking the white-domed Capitol ) as well as its best plates , each showcasing the produce , dairy and meats of local small , and usually organic , producers . <p> It is mid-September . And , besides the power-chef activity of buying ingredients for wild hazelnut tart with maple ice cream ; trout with wild mushroom spaetzle and seared baby bok choy , and seared foie gras with Fredonia grape gastrique ( all on the menu that night ) , Piper 's mind is working full tilt on bottling grape juice , making plum compote , freezing butternut squash and drying zucchini . <p> She will put them up . And she will put her staff up to the kinds of tasks you thought existed only in farm life 40 years ago . <p> L'Etoile has been featured in Food &; Wine , Gourmet and other magazines , and Piper has been a guest chef at the James Beard House in New York City and appeared on Pierre Franey 's public television series " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her use of local and often indigenous ingredients , which are superb ( in part because she has supported farmers ' efforts to improve food quality ) . <p> To succeed at that so far north , preserving food is a key element . Herb vinegars , fruit jams , apple cider syrup  --  these are part of her arsenal of raw materials . If she serves fresh goat cheese and green garlic baked in a squash blossom in the summer , in autumn she offers a strudel of local wild mushrooms and a plum compote . <p> " You know , we 've been doing this all year , beginning in the spring , " Piper says , about how she squirrels away foods . <p> Later , back at the restaurant , she shows off bottles of pickled white asparagus , sugar snap peas , bags of shelled hickory nuts , dried strawberry slices , violets and lavender blossoms . In her basement , she says , she has four freezers stuffed with cubes upon cubes of frozen squash and fruit purees . <p> Months from now , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed into gnocchi with rosemary cider cream , and dried fruits will fill a strudel for tenderloin of venison . <p> Today , as the skies gray and the farmers press radios to their ears to listen for updates on a possible frost , Piper pulls at some baseball-bat-size zucchinis and loads them into the wagon . She spins an idea for a dish as she shops . <p> " I want to grate the zucchini and dry it  --  it concentrates flavor and is easier to store , " she begins . " And , since they 're in the squash family , I 'll roast the seeds . . . they 'll taste like pumpkin seeds . . . and make a pesto with them . " <p> The Madison farmers market , a 200-stall market that wraps around the Capitol from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. every Saturday from early May to late October , attracts 10,000 to 25,000 shoppers and browsers each week . <p> The market and L'Etoile have a symbiotic relationship . Its farmers sustain L'Etoile at the same time that L'Etoile sends appreciative diners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and suppliers , and they have delivered , by early morning , crates of fruit , salad greens and other staples to L'Etoile 's back door . <p> With plums delivered earlier , Piper begins a compote . It will serve as a topping for ice cream nestled in a pistachio cookie cup . She piques the dark fruit 's exotic quotient with licorice hyssop , a summer herb , but because the hyssop is delicate , she enhances it with star anise . <p> Plum puree , cooking on another burner , combined with Fredonia grape puree will become a gastrique served under a duck breast , fresh market beans and a dark-spiced lebkuchen rusk ( dried cookie ) . Gastrique , explains Piper , is her term for a sauce in which tangy fruit and vegetable purees highlight and contrast , say , a rich ( " unctuous , " she calls it ) foie gras or game such as duck or venison . <p> With the grated zucchini , Piper creates a frittata ( an open-face omelet ) whose flavors are boosted with chopped fresh herbs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zucchini would do well , slightly reconstituted , in a zucchini bread , " she says , the creative wheels still turning . Ever the practical chef , she pulls out store-bought pumpkin seeds to make pesto for the frittata when the zucchini she opens do not yield mature-enough seeds to roast . <p> Dinner at L'Etoile that evening is framed by a chilly autumnal rain outside the picture-window glass . But inside the restaurant , perched on the second floor , the menu comes alive in a warm , vibrant composition of the raw materials at market that morning . <p> On the blackboard against the north , brick wall is a list of desserts , among them a terrine of three spiced fruit sorbets ( blueberry , apricot and raspberry ) , a chocolate cherry Vesuvius and a white peach melba , each highlighting fruits from the market . On the opposite wall , a blackboard locates the restaurant 's producers on a hand-drawn map on which is printed : " L'Etoile supports sustainable agriculture with purchases from these local farmers . " <p> Piper shows that sustainable agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 25 N. Pinckney in Madison , Wis . It serves dinner from 6 p.m . Monday through Thursday and from 5:30 p.m . Friday and Saturday .

Here are some tips : <p> First try making them without nuts ; the batter will be much easier to work with . If using nuts , be sure to chop them very fine . <p> Make smaller cups . Try baking a level tablespoonful of batter , then draping the baked cookie over a smaller cup . <p> Learn to watch for the exact moment when the warm cookie is neither runny nor stiff and is just malleable enough to shape . Cooling time before molding depends on the consistency of the batter , the oven temperature and the room temperature . <p> Nutrition Information ( per serving ) Calories : 366 From fat : 180 Percentages of daily value based on 2,000-calorie diet . <p> Total fat 20g 31% Saturated fat 9g 43% Cholesterol 33mg 11% Sodium 24mg 1% Carbohydrate 45g 15% Dietary fiber 2g 9% Sugars 11g <p> Protein 4g <p> Vitamin A 12% Vitamin C 2% Calcium 5% Iron 15%
