GEORGE BUSH HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN UPBEAT , WHISTLE-WHILE-you-work , stay-the-course kind of guy . Yet top aides to the President say he is depressed about his political position , running behind Ross Perot in nationwide opinion surveys , and despondent that his " loyal " advisers are bad-mouthing him to the press . " These guys tell him where to go , what to do , how to stand , what to say , " says one Bush confidante , " and when none of it works , they turn around and blame him . " Even old friends in Texas are sending rumblings to Washington that Bush might not have the " fire in the belly " to beat a man like Perot . Quick to attack any perception of weakness , Bush reminded G.O.P. backers in Atlanta , " Lest you think I 've lost the fire , I 'm ready . "
