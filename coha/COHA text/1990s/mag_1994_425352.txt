What to do when you have too much of a good thing <p> IT IS N'T FAIR . Over the years you devote much time and treasure to your lawn , only to discover that it has mysteriously taken a turn for the worse . The once-lustrous green carpet has become a patchwork quilt of green , yellow , and brown . Why did it suddenly decline ? To solve this mystery , you need to take a closer look . When you do , you will probably find that the disquieting array of colors comprises weeds and grass plants that have fallen prey to insects and diseases . <p> If you cut a pie-shaped wedge of sod from your lawn and examine it , you 'll see a layer of thatch  --  a dense , spongy collection of old , undecomposed grass parts  --  between the grass leaves and the soil surface . These roots , stolons ( above-ground stems ) , and rhizomes ( below-ground stems ) are shed by grass plants as new ones develop . Unlike grass clippings , which decay quickly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , collecting on the soil surface faster than they decompose . <p> Lawn grasses differ in their propensity to produce thatch . Those that exhibit quick rates of growth , such as Kentucky bluegrass and hybrid Bermuda grass cultivars , are heavy thatch builders , but so are certain slower-growing grasses , such as red rescue and zoysia . By contrast , tall fescue and perennial ryegrass have a low tendency to produce thatch . <p> Discovering thatch in your lawn is n't automatically cause for alarm . A shallow layer of thatch ( under half an inch ) actually benefits the lawn . Thatch acts as a natural cushion , enabling the lawn to endure wear and tear . It also works as a mulch by retaining moisture and insulating the soil from temperature extremes . Unfortunately , thatch can become a thick , destructive layer , affecting the health , vigor , and appearance of your lawn . <p> If the thatch layer in your lawn exceeds one-half an inch in thickness , the disadvantages outweigh the advantages . In heavy thatch , grass roots tend to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so a heavily thatched lawn needs to be irrigated frequently to keep it alive . Yet this repeated watering causes nutrients to leach out of the thatch and into the soil . There they are beyond the reach of the roots , which impedes grass growth . A thick thatch layer also provides a safe haven for diseases and damaging insects . <p> If you have a thatch problem , you first need to dethatch , that is , physically remove the thatch from the lawn . For a small area , you can use a dethatching rake . The sharp curved blades slide through the thatch and lift it as you pull the rake across the lawn . A larger area , however , is best tackled with power-driven dethatching equipment . This machinery must be used correctly , so many people hire a reputable lawn maintenance company to do the job . The most effective dethatching equipment available is a vertical mower with revolving straight fixed blades , although flail-type dethatchers are also widely used . Both the spacing between the knives and the depth should be adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasses can tolerate closer spacing while stoloniferous types need a wider one . For Kentucky bluegrass and red fescue , the blades should be spaced one to two inches apart . The same is true for Bermuda grass and zoysia . For centipede grass , the spacing should be two to three inches and for St. Augustine grass it should be three inches . The blades should cut into the thatch layer and at least one-half inch into the soil . Both types of dethatching machines will lift thatch to the surface and cultivate the soil without seriously injuring the grass plants themselves , although the flail-type blades may bounce up when encountering a thick , dense layer of thatch or dry , compacted soil . Also , when the spacing of the flail-type blades is reduced to less than one and a half inches , lawn grasses may be injured <p> The best time to dethatch a lawn is in late summer or early fall for cool-season grasses , and in spring or early summer for warm-season grasses . Since this process is a traumatic experience for a lawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of favorable growing conditions subsequent to the operation . Also avoid excessively hot or dry periods . <p> Lawns containing grasses with underground rhizomes , such as Kentucky bluegrass and zoysia , may be vertically mowed in several directions without killing the lawn . However , grasses with aboveground stolons , such as centipede and St. Augustine , may be killed with multiple passes , so a single pass is best to avoid removing too much material and slowing down recovery . <p> If you are dealing with a two- to three-inch thatch layer , widen the spacing of the blades to reduce injury to the grass plants and remove only a portion of the thatch at a time . Allow the lawn to fully recover , generally a month 's time , before you attempt to reduce the depth of the layer any further . Irrigation during dry spells will hasten recovery . <p> After dethatching , rake or sweep up the dead material and add it to the compost pile or use it as a mulch in the vegetable garden . Thoroughly water the lawn to prevent the exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apply one pound of actual nitrogen per 1,000 square feet of lawn and irrigate afterward to minimize burn . It is best to use a formulation in which the water-soluble portion of the nitrogen is less than 50 percent . <p> To prevent the return of your thatch problem , it is important to understand that the presence of thatch signals an imbalance between growth and decomposition . It therefore behooves you to create an environment in which grass residues do not accumulate excessively . Keep the soil pH between 6 and 7 to encourage decomposition . Soils that are more acidic hamper the activity of earthworms , insects , and microbes involved in breaking down thatch . Compaction is another contributor to slower decomposition . In heavy clay soils especially , compaction will restrict oxygen levels and in turn impair the activity of soil-borne organisms . Core aeration  --  removing cores of soil from the lawn with hollow tines  --  will alleviate compaction and will facilitate the movement of air and water into the soil .

For cool-season grasses , concentrate on applying a slow-release fertilizer in early fall and forgo spring applications . For warm-season grasses , late spring ( after green-up ) and summer are best , again with a slow-release fertilizer . <p> If you manage your lawn with a concern for the welfare of the grass , the soil , and its inhabitants , you 'll find that you wo n't have problems with thatch . As with most of horticulture , there 's no mystery to keeping your lawn healthy and attractive . <p> PHOTO : Excessive thatch can create a droughty , shallow-rooted , weed-infested turf . <p> PHOTO : An optimum layer of thatch cushions the grass , conserves moisture , and encourages growth of roots and underground life . <p> By Bob Polomski <p> Illustrated by Jean Emmons <p> <p> Bob Polomski is a horticulturist for the cooperation extension service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
