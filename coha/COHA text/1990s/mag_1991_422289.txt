Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS A behind-the-scenes look at how Thomas 's nomination blew apart  --  and led to the hearings that stunned the nation <p> Dateline : Washington ; Oklahoma <p> It pre-empted the game shows , it interrupted weekend plans of foliaging , it transfixed a nation . It was carnal , ugly and surreal . This was the Scandal With Everything  --  penises , power , intense emotional pain  --  and millions tuned in . They watched an X-rated spectacle that was repulsive and irresistible at the same time . <p> But the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearing last Friday and Saturday was one of those remarkable moments in the political life and social consciousness of a generation . Far more was at stake than a seat on the Supreme Court , more than deciphering what , if anything , happened between a man and a woman 10 years ago . The Senate itself , 98 percent male , was on trial : Had it almost let a brute slip his way onto the court ? Or was it an accomplice in a despicable case of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided the stage . Here , in the marbled sanctum of the Congress is where a despot met his demise in the Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954 , Watergate unraveled in 1973 and Iran-contra unfolded in 1987 . On every network and for 21 hours , the two witnesses , separately , offered their polar versions to the Judiciary Committee . First in the dock was Thomas , who unequivocally denied that he had sexually harassed Hill when they worked together from 1981 to 1983 at the Department of Education and then the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . He had dismissed his White House handlers , and it showed . In a tone of fury and rue , he skewered the senators . " This is Kafkaesque . Enough is enough , " he said . " I have not said or done the things that Anita Hill has alleged . God has gotten me through ... and he is my judge . " It was a peroration that made the president of the United States weep . <p> Then Hill offered her excruciating account . In lurid detail , she described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke graphically about pornography , bestiality , rape and his skills as a lover . " He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts involved in various sex acts , " she testified . The " oddest episode , " Hill said , occurred when he was drinking a Coke in his EEOC office . " He got up from the table at which we were working , went over to his desk to get the Coke , looked at the can and asked , ' Who has put pubic hair on my Coke ? " ' <p> When Thomas returned to the witness table shortly after 8 p.m. , he was even angrier than he had been in the morning . " This is a circus , it 's a national disgrace and from my standpoint as a black American ... it 's a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks , " he said . " It is a message that ... you will be lynched , destroyed , caricatured by a committee of the U.S. Senate rather than hung from a tree . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the seen-it-all-before culture of Washington . Just a Sunday ago , Thomas 's confirmation looked like a lock . How his nomination blew apart  --  at the warped speed only American politics can move  --  is a story about stupidity and luck , betrayal and indifference , cynicism and leaks . Rarely have so many politicians miscalculated so badly in such a short amount of time . <p> THE SLEAZE HUNTERS : In the beginning , as it inexorably seems to be under the new hardball rules of politics , there was the search for sleaze . <p> Last July , as Clarence Thomas stood beside President Bush on a Kennebunkport lawn to accept his nomination , Republicans could hardly contain their glee . Once more , Bush had outfoxed the Democrats . How could white senators vote against a black nominee who , though conservative , had risen from the depths of Southern poverty ? Liberal interest groups , with only the scalp of Robert Bork to show for all their judicial headhunting in recent years , nonetheless held out hope . At least it was worth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high court into the 2030s . Since his controversial legal views alone were unlikely to sway senators to vote him down , liberals went out to scour Thomas 's personal life . Journalist Juan Williams had done several profiles of Thomas over the years . In a Washington Post op-ed piece last week , Williams revealed that all summer long he was called by eager Senate staffers seeking " anything on your interview tapes we can use to stop Thomas . " Did he ever take money from the South African government ? Did he beat his first wife ? <p> Nothing surfaced-until they got lucky . In August , Nan Aron , head of the Alliance for Justice , which opposed Thomas , got a call from a person saying Thomas had harassed an employee named Anita Hill in the early ' 80s . The male caller , whom Aron says she knew , had been a classmate of Hill 's at Yale Law School . It is n't known whether he was calling at Hill 's behest or even with her knowledge . In any event , Aron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard Metzenbaum , the only member of the Judiciary Committee to vote against Thomas 's successful nomination to the federal appeals court in Washington in 1990 . Metzenbaum seemed to be the most likely senator to pursue the tip . It was a long shot . Juicy charges percolate up at the last minute in many Supreme Court fights and they usually do n't pan out . <p> Metzenbaum 's Labor-committee staff went forward . On Sept. 3 or 4 , a female aide phoned Hill . According to Metzenbaum 's chronology , the call was only part of a routine inquiry to three women who worked with Thomas at EEOC . Hill , a law professor at the University of Oklahoma , was asked about such legal issues as gender discrimination . The aide mentioned rumors of sexual harassment , but Hill offered nothing . On Sept. 5 a second Labor aide , Ricki Seidman , called Hill . Seidman works as an investigator for Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy , who , like Metzenbaum , sits on both Labor and Judiciary . This time Hill said she needed to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill agreed to talk . Seidman referred her to a Metzenbaum lawyer named James Brudney , who had attended Yale with Hill . The next day-when the first round of Thomas 's confirmation hearings began  --  Hill detailed her accusations to Brudney . Trouble was , Brudney was n't on the Judiciary staff . So , after consulting Metzenbaum , he forwarded the charges to Harriet Grant , chief of nominations for Judiciary . On Sept. 12 , in two calls , Hill repeated her story to Grant . <p> THE FUMBLE : The ball was rolling  --  with one roadblock . According to Biden , Hill demanded confidentiality , that Thomas not be informed of her charges and that the FBI undertake no investigation . Hill told Grant that she wanted to share her concerns with the committee to " remove responsibility " and " take it out of her hands . " Biden decided not to tell other committee members of the allegations . Only he , Metzenbaum and Kennedy knew at this point . <p> Over the next week , as the Thomas hearings continued , Hill spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call-from Susan Hoerchner , a Yale classmate of Hill 's , who told Grant that Hill confided in her in the spring of 1981 , at the time of the first alleged harassment by Thomas . Hoerchner corroborated Hill 's account , reporting that Hill said Thomas caused her to doubt her own professional abilities . On Sept. 19 Hill called Grant again . For the first time Hill said she wanted all committee members to know her story , even if her name had to be used . Hill insisted she did n't want to " abandon " her concerns about Thomas . The day before , she had given an interview to the University of Oklahoma student newspaper . Though she made no mention of harassment , she said " there were a lot of better " candidates than Thomas for the court vacancy . <p> Still , she was not willing to involve the FBI , a routine step Biden demanded before the issue could go further . Hill thought it over , concluding on Sept. 21 that she did n't want the FBI investigation because she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later , in what was at least the seventh conversation that week between Hill and the Judiciary staff , Hill said she would submit a statement of her charges to the committee and then agree to bring in the FBI . Throughout these September negotiations , some senators suspect Hill was in regular contact with aides to Kennedy and Metzenbaum , especially Brudney . Thomas 's supporters point to them as the source of alleged arm-twisting on Hill . Sen. Dennis DeConcini , a Democrat , says it 's apparent that " a Labor-committee aide was giving her advice . " Similarly , the White House wonders if Metzenbaum and Kennedy staff badgered Hill into relenting on confidentiality . <p> Hill faxed her four-page statement to the committee on Sept 23 . Biden passed it on to the White House and FBI . This was the first the Bush administration had heard of Hill 's claims . White House counsel C. Boyden Gray ordered the FBI to investigate . While the president was briefed , he and his advisers perceived no ticking time bomb ; they assumed the charges would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oklahoma . Over the next two days , the FBI also talked with Hoerchner and Thomas himself The nominee learned of the allegations when the FBI showed up at his suburban Virginia house to interview him ; he denied the allegations . The FBI completed its report on the 25th . Sources who 've seen it say it reads like a bad wire story , a collection of he-said , she-said quotes that reaches no conclusion . Nonetheless , the White House and Republican senators would eventually claim publicly that the report proved Hill wrong . <p> The White House sent Biden the report , along with a memo from Ken Duberstein , the former Reagan chief of staff hired to manage Thomas 's confirmation machine . Biden and his defenders say Hill 's desire for confidentiality precluded further investigation . " Talk about sexual harassment , " says a friend of Biden . " How could you pressure this woman ? " Of course , he could have called Hill to Washington so that he could meet with her privately to assess her credibility . He could have summoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that surely risked a leak . Or he or any other committee member with knowledge of the allegation could have asked for a delay in the vote , pending an attempt at further inquiry . <p> Biden made one obvious mistake . It was on the night of Sept. 25 , after he had received the FBI report . Admittedly under pressure from the White House to get Thomas confirmed before the Supreme Court started its term Oct. 7 , Biden scheduled the Judiciary vote on Thomas for Sept. 27 . Yet he knew he would n't be briefing most of his fellow committee Democrats on the Hill charges until the 26th . That gave colleagues little chance to ask for a postponement of the vote . Biden says he or an aide verbally briefed each of the seven Democrats on the 25th or 26th , and that each had access to both the FBI report and Hill 's statement before the vote on Friday the 27th . But some of the senators say Biden gave them short shrift ; at least one was never told of the report , NEWSWEEK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other committee Democrats just 20 minutes before the vote  --  while Biden was on the Senate floor announcing his opposition to Thomas even as he vouched for his character . <p> Biden was n't the only one who dropped the ball . NEWSWEEK has learned that Sen. Strom Thurmond , the ranking Republican on Judiciary , did n't tell all the five GOP members of the allegations . Arlen Specter , a wavering vote , first heard about Hill on Thursday ( from two Democratic colleagues ) ; he met with Thomas for 30 minutes the morning of the vote . Thurmond staffers told aides to Hank Brown of the charges , but said it contained " nothing of significance , " according to Brown . Charles Grassley learned of Hill in newspapers more than a week later . Paul Simon , a Democrat , apparently is the only senator who spoke to Anita Hill prior to the Friday vote . Simon received a call from one of Hill 's friends asking that he phone her . When they spoke on Thursday , Hill asked Simon to give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise confidential . Simon suggested that a leak would inevitably occur , so Hill decided against distribution . <p> Despite the 7-7 deadlock by the Judiciary Committee , Thomas 's prospects for confirmation were excellent . The week of Sept. 30 , moderate Democrats began declaring support . By Friday , Thomas by all counts had enough votes to win . Going into the weekend-with a full Senate vote scheduled for Tuesday-what could go wrong ? " We thought this was in the bag , " says a senior administration official . <p> THE BOMBSHELL : Sunday is a sleepy day in the capital . Other than churchgoers , the only folks in stockings and ties seem to be on Brinkley . It was this calm that Newsday and National Public Radio disturbed on Oct. 6 , when they ran stories on Hill 's accusations . Actually , the administration and Thomas knew the night before that the Hill story was about to break . Duberstein turned on the spin cycle . Sen. John Danforth , the Missouri Republican and Thomas 's chief patron , held an impromptu press conference at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be thermonuclear , with a chain reaction to match . Danforth should have listened to his wife . " I dismissed it and she did n't , " he acknowleged to The New York Times . <p> On Monday morning , the Democratic Senate leadership maintained the vote on Thomas would proceed as scheduled the next day . The White House maintained a low profile , though aides did accuse the Democrats of a smear campaign . The assumption that the Hill charges would go away , however , evaporated when Anita Hill went on television . In a one-hour press conference beamed from Norman , Okla. , Hill may have killed Clarence Thomas 's career plans for the next 40 years . She was credible , she was articulate , she was poised  --  even in the face of enough menacing phone calls at home that she notified the police . " I resent the idea that people would blame the messenger for the message , rather than looking at the content of the message itself , " she said . The political seismographs in Washington recorded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hook in the Senate . <p> Still , the White House continued to believe Thomas had the votes . Several key senators , NEWSWEEK has learned , told administration officials they needed some evidence , as one official put it , to " hide behind ... something that would allow them to say ' I considered his story and hers , and he 's telling the truth ' . " Gray 's office lined up women who worked with Thomas at EEOC who would sing his praises . At 4 p.m. , Bush 's team gathered to reassess the mess . No women were present . They concluded that , because Hill continued her relationship with Thomas long after she left EEOC , senators could be convinced that she could not possibly have viewed his alleged behavior as very serious . <p> Leak hunting became an obsession for Republican senators . Their suspicion centered on Metzenbaum , Kennedy and their staffs . Hatch accused Metzenbaum directly  --  who denied it  --  and he later apologized . Brown said he intends this week to ask for the appointment of a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffs . NEWSWEEK has learned that one meeting of all the chief lawyers for the Democratic members of Judiciary turned into a shouting contest . At issue was Biden 's vivisection in the press by these lawyers being quoted anonymously . " People do n't trust each other anymore , " said a participant . <p> Thomas was active on his own behalf . Late Monday , in one of their many phone conversations that day , Thomas told Danforth that Hill had called him throughout the ' 80s . Danforth tracked down Thomas 's former secretary , who told him there were phone logs of Thomas 's messages . That night Republican Sen. Alan Simpson read from them on " Nightline "  --  there were 11 calls over a six-year period-to bolster the case that Hill hardly seemed too upset with her former boss , The next day the logs were fed to the press . " We thought the logs would put an end to it , " says a senior administration official . " Little did we know . " <p> THE REVOLT : On Tuesday Specter stunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Democrats warned they would vote Thomas down if forced to vote . The key protest may actually have been choreographed over at the House of Representatives . Around midday seven women members of the House marched to the Capitol room where the Democratic senators were in caucus . If the boys did n't " get it " before , they did now . The symbolism was palpable . " The thing everyone miscalculated was the reaction of the women , the girls ' vote , " says a Bush adviser . " The Senate crumbled before our very eyes . " Two hours after the scheduled vote and a splenetic day of C-Spanning , senators formally agreed to delay the vote by a week . <p> That left only 2 1/2 days to prepare for the new round of Judiciary hearings , but that was plenty of time to fan the flames . Bush was enraged and vowed war on the Democrats after the curtain went down on the Thomas matter . Some of the Democrats continued to wage war among themselves . And on Thursday , the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela Wright , had come forward to claim Thomas had harassed her . Yet , even with that revelation , nobody could have anticipated the perverse spell on Friday and Saturday of Hill-Thomas showdown . <p> THE CONFRONTATION : Under the bright lights , ripped bare before the American public , Hill and Thomas were both effective witnesses . She offered compelling specificity ; he , at times in tears , spoke passionately of a process out of control , of a reputation and a family shattered . The Republicans went after her for being inconsistent and opportunistic , and suggested her reference to " Long Dong Silver " was inspired by a court case in Kansas . The Democrats , if gingerly , kept asking him how on earth his accuser could make up so much . Hill and Thomas both had legions of character references . She even volunteered to take a polygraph . <p> Like great drama , though , there will be no objective truth . In the end , the stories of Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill are irreconcilable , unless one of them capitulates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . Either way , it will commit a terrible wrong . In his closing remarks to Thomas Saturday night , Biden said " process " was n't the problem . That was his response to Hill and Thomas , who had managed to agree on one thing : they were treated miserably . Biden was right only in the sense that the process led to an admirable result-awareness about harassment . <p> But what of the way we conduct our national soul-searching ? Sunshine may be a disinfectant ; it can also be blinding . From the way Hill 's allegation emerged to the way it played out in prime time , from the insensitivity of the senators to the humiliation of two people , the Thomas spectacle hardly is an endorsement of freewheeling politics . The public was mesmerized by the show , yet shuddered at the indignity of it all . Politics has become pathology . <p> I felt that I had to tell the truth . ' <p> Thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess ... He spoke about acts he had seen in pornographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told anyone of his behavior that it would ruin his career . ' Professor Hill <p> <p> It is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks ... ' <p> These are charges that play into racist , bigoted stereotypes . ' <p> Enough is enough ... I have not said or done the things that Anita Hill has alleged . God has gotten me through ... and he is my judge . ' Judge Thomas <p> <p> From what you 've seen , heard or read do you think Clarence Thomas sexually harassed Anita Hill ?
