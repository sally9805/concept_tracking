Florence Nightingale overcame a disapproving mother , jealous colleagues and skeptical surgeons to become the founder of modern nursing , but she never had to duke it out with cost-cutting HMO executives . If she had , she might have sounded as angry and alarmed as the 47 nurses who wrote in response to our report " The New Hands-Off Nursing " SOCIETY , Sept. 30 . <P> James Kunen 's article on the trend toward replacing nurses with unlicensed patient-care technicians led Clare Kranstover , an R.N. and caseworker with Kemper National Services in Park City , Utah , to issue this blunt warning : " Patients , beware ! You will be at risk when hospitals put you in the hands of a technician . If the person caring for you does not have R.N. after his or her name , leave that hospital immediately ! " Kranstover , 41 , has been a nurse for 11 years , and was a cardiac nurse at a San Diego hospital the night a technician allowed a patient who had just suffered a heart attack to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden the patient 's heart monitor showed ventricular fibrillation , a life-threatening condition in which you can die within minutes , " says Kranstover . " I rushed in to resuscitate him . He almost did n't make it . " <P> Stephen Dohl , now a nursing supervisor at a Charlotte , North Carolina , skilled-nursing facility , wrote of the stressful night in a local hospital when he was the only nurse  --  working with two assistant nurses and one technician  --  in charge of 37 patients . Downsizing , explains Dohl , 43 , is the reason he no longer works in a hospital . " The more experienced nurses tend to be the ones let go , " he says . " Then they are replaced with people fresh out of school who are cheaper . I left hospital nursing because I could n't give patients the time I felt they needed . " Such ruthless budget slashing disillusioned Susan M. Heffernan , a 34-year-old New York City nurse . " It is an atrocity that an annual salary of $71,250 for an R.N. with 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote . " To hospital administrators who want to replace R.N.s with unlicensed workers , I say , ' Someday you will be in the hospital ! And then there wo n't be any time to rethink your decision . ' " <P> One of 20 non-nurses who wrote us about the report , Linda Emery Evans respects the skill of nurses even though she had a narrow escape while under an R.N. 's care . " Within hours of the birth of my daughter last spring , I was in unspeakable pain , " wrote Evans , 34 . " I was unable to convince the nurse that I was experiencing something more than postpartum pain . " After hours of pleading , Evans was operated on for internal bleeding . " I think the nurse was not really listening to what I was telling her , " she says . " She may have been overworked . But I can only imagine the outcome if a technician had been dealing with me instead of an experienced R.N. What if the nurse had heard about my symptoms secondhand from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would the damage have been then ? "
