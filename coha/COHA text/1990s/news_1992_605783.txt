<p> Guns and drugs often are cited as root causes for the violence that made 1991 the most murderous year in Prince George 's County history . <p> Less attention is paid to another important factor : a history of zoning practices that allowed the construction of hundreds of poorly built , low-rent apartments where much of the blood during the last year was shed . <p> At least 69 of the 158 homicides reported in Prince George 's during 1991 occurred in apartment communities , according to a review of police records by The Washington Post . And if open spaces or commercial strips next to apartment complexes are considered , the number of homicides in or near rental communities rises to 83 , the records show . <p> Although county police can not say exactly how many other violent crimes have occurred in apartment complexes , they said a disproportionate percentage of the county 's stabbings , sexual assaults and muggings take place in the low-rise garden apartments that are so prevalent in Prince George 's . And nearly all of the county 's largest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , police said . <p> " Crime in general and violent crime in particular is more likely to occur in a certain kind of environment , and unfortunately Prince George 's has a disproportionately large number of run-down and densely populated complexes that are conducive to crime and drugs , " said County Executive Parris N. Glendening ( D ) . <p> Many of the county 's garden apartments have become the private equivalent of public housing complexes , plagued by the violence , persistent poverty and structural decay that turned public housing in cities such as Chicago , Houston and Detroit into virtual urban combat zones , several housing specialists said . <p> " Criminals tend to gravitate toward settings that look permissible to crime , " said William Brill , an apartment security consultant in Annapolis who has researched crime trends in rental and public housing . <p> " If apartment complexes are well lit and well maintained , they transmit an image that crime is unacceptable . If they are poorly lit and run-down , it 's like an open invitation to trouble . " <p> Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Washington area , with most of it in 286 privately owned garden apartment communities with a total of 70,329 rental units , housing officials said . <p> Unlike Fairfax and Montgomery counties , which adopted zoning favoring single-family home construction in the 1950s and 1960s , Prince George 's officials during the same period approved zoning changes that allowed construction of hundreds of large complexes on what had been farmland . <p> About half the county residents who live inside the Capital Beltway now call a garden apartment home . In areas such as Landover , Glenarden and Oxon Hill , the big units are stacked close together , creating miles-long vistas of boxy , three-story brick-and-cement buildings . <p> Many of the garden apartment complexes  --  so named because they typically have clusters of three- and four-story walkups surrounding a common courtyard and parking lot  --  offer safe and affordable housing . But about a third , roughly 100 , have fallen into various states of decay through a combination of poor construction , lax property management and a design that crowds as many as 4,000 low-income residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , said Lynda Given , the county 's deputy chief administrative officer for housing and community development . <p> By their very design , garden apartments are vulnerable to crime , police and housing officials said . " At the time garden apartments were conceived , the typical design did not foresee the security issues that we are seeing in the 1990s , " Given said . <p> Garden apartments typically include dozens of buildings situated around huge and poorly lit parking lots that allow cars to enter and exit from different directions . The roads through the complexes often form a labyrinth that makes police surveillance difficult . Although individual apartments usually have security doors , the buildings often have open entrances on three or four sides , allowing easy access and quick getaways . <p> Many of the complexes are in relatively secluded areas that lack playgrounds or parks , prompting large numbers of people  --  particularly youths  --  to congregate in parking lots or courtyards . <p> " The open areas were one of our biggest problems , " said Larry Blake , 38 , a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex that once was the site of one of the county 's largest open-air drug markets . <p> " You have these big open spaces that are sheltered from the street , " Blake said . " Drug dealers saw they had a ready-made market and muscled their way in to take control . It got to the point where you could not drive through the parking lot without being approached three or four times . . . and you would n't dare let your kids play outside . " <p> Design flaws are not the only factor that has contributed to the crime and drug-trafficking . In many ways , the history of the county 's decaying stock of apartments is the story of a housing trend that went awry . <p> The apartment construction boom that produced almost 300 complexes helped lure almost 350,000 new residents  --  many of them low-income renters  --  to Prince George 's in the 1960s , according to housing officials and U.S. Census data . By 1970 , rentals accounted for half of the county 's overall housing stock , and the garden apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which elected officials approved zoning changes that helped make millions for developers with whom they had business ties . <p> Many of the large complexes were built with federal funding that restricted developers to inexpensive materials and prohibited such " amenities " as balconies , air conditioning or swimming pools . More than $ 35 million in federal money helped finance the 1960s rental construction boom in Prince George 's . The boom predated the county 's adoption of a comprehensive building code in the late 1970s , so developers did not have to include landscaping , parks and other amenities . <p> The most spectacular garden apartment debacle was the federally financed Baber Village complex , which opened in 1969 to serve low-income families and eight years later was closed by county officials who said the Seat Pleasant complex had declined beyond repair . <p> As several critics predicted then , Prince George 's is still paying for that period of rampant rental construction , long after developers made their profits and moved on . <p> " It was clear that too many garden apartments were built in the heyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up , " said Maryland Secretary of State Winfield M. Kelly Jr. , who was Prince George 's county executive from 1974 to 1978 . <p> " They . . . have contributed significantly to many of the problems that this county is struggling with today , " said Kelly , who introduced a " New Quality " credo during his term to block low-income apartment construction and instead focus on single-family houses . <p> Faced with a glut of deteriorating rental housing , county officials during the last decade have been using what they called the " carrot and stick " approach to make landlords increase security and make repairs . <p> The stick is strict building code enforcement such as fining and otherwise penalizing landlords who ignore faulty plumbing , broken windows and other structural decay . The carrot is special financing at below-market rates that the county offers to owners of low-rent properties who have little ability or incentive to make costly repairs . From 1980 to 1986 , the county provided developers with almost $ 367 million in special financing through the sale of tax-exempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 578-unit Glenarden Apartments , for example , the county helped finance the installation of tot lots , recreation facilities , new street lights and security gates . The county also required Glenarden 's owners to tear down 10 of their 60 buildings to provide parking space , and to reconfigure the remaining buildings into smaller villages . The owners also had to hire resident managers to screen tenant applicants and inspect apartments once a year . <p> In 1986 , however , the tax laws that helped renovate Glenarden changed , limiting the amount of below-market financing the county can provide to apartment owners to about $ 12 million annually  --  enough to cover the cost of renovating about one complex a year . <p> " That change was a big blow for us because it effectively removed the biggest incentive we could provide to encourage property owners to maintain or purchase apartment buildings , " Given said . <p> County officials now have only building code enforcement to motivate landlords . Even that tool has been dulled by budget cuts . The number of apartment building inspectors has been cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy director of the Environmental Resources Department , which oversees the county 's apartment inspections . Inspections on " distressed " properties , the worst of the worst , have been reduced from once every 60 days to once every 120 days . <p> Budget cuts also have hindered expansion of the Prince George 's police department 's community policing program , in which foot patrols and police substations are housed in 19 troubled apartment communities . <p> " We 've got a serious problem with so many older apartment buildings in the county when you ca n't hold much of a carrot out there anymore and the stick is n't what it used to be either , " Healey said . <p> " Apartments are a fact of life in Prince George 's County , " Healey said , " and we all have to realize that their upkeep is crucial because it helps maintain the quality of life and safety and pride in this county .
