<p> ONE OF SEVERAL EXTRAORDINARY snippets of archival film in the documentary " A Life Apart : Hasidism in America " shows the Lubavitcher Rebbe 's 1929 visit to New York , during which his American followers implored him to leave behind the perils of Stalin 's Soviet Union and bring his flock to the United States . America was not yet ready for Hasidism , the Rebbe replied ; America was a trefina medina , an impure and unholy place where even rabbis shaved their beards . <p> How unimaginable catastrophes soon befell the Hasidim and all of European Jewry , how the tattered remnant of Hasidim washed up on shores they had once spurned , how they reasserted their faith and rebuilt their communities there against seemingly insurmountable odds : this is the story told in " A Life Apart : Hasidism in America , " which begins a weeklong run at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center on Friday . The documentary was produced and directed by Menachem Daum and Oren Rudavsky , two New York filmmakers who have Hasidic roots but now occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people think of Hasidim only as those exotic , Yiddish-speaking men with beards and side curls , black hats and 19th-century suits that they see schmoozing in the Manhattan diamond district on West 47th Street , or strolling through the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg , Borough Park and Crown Heights . Or those frumpy women with wigs , often with baby carriages in tow . And if the Hasidim are sometimes eyed warily , as a reclusive , unlikable and unassimilable presence , the Hasidim appear to stare back with equal wariness , at a culture they consider corrupt and sacrilegious . <p> Perhaps more than anyone before them , Mr. Daum and Mr. Rudavsky have managed to cross the abyss separating the two worlds , and maybe even to show that it 's not as unbridgeable as some might think . Families and individuals from various Hasidic sects  --  the Bobovers , the Belzers , the Gerers , the Skvers , the Satmars , the Lubavitchers , each named for the town in prewar Eastern Europe where it originated  --  invited them into their homes , schools and synagogues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from circumcisions to first haircuts to weddings , a life cycle that among Hasidim does not take long . <p> The lives revealed are rich with ceremony and prayer , with the fervent , joyous chanting , singing and dancing that from Hasidism 's early days in 18th-century Eastern Europe , set Hasidim apart from mainstream Jews . These lives are filled too with kvelling , or bursts of pride over the love that binds Hasidim together , and over the faith , courage and tenacity that have led to their regeneration . <p> Early in the film , Leonard Nimoy , who shares the narration with Sarah Jessica Parker , states that the Hasidim " arouse controversy among other Jews , no less than among Gentiles . " The statement would be truer if one struck the " no less " and added " much more . " Many mainstream Jews find Hasidim ( Hebrew for " pious ones " ) self-righteous , almost embarrassing  --  unsettling reminders of what these more secular co-religionists once were . Mr. Rudavsky and Mr. Daum asked more than 200 Jewish organizations to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jewish Culture chipped in more than a token amount . <p> The filmmakers acknowledge the negative stereotypes : that Hasidim are mean or ugly or pushy or unhygienic . And , surely a bit too gently for some tastes , they address the intolerance , racism and sexism of which the Hasidim often stand accused . But almost to a man and a woman , the people in " A Life Apart "  --  the older ones speaking Yiddish flecked occasionally with English words , their American-born offspring speaking Yiddish-accented and slightly imperfect English  --  are sensitive and endearing . Some are even funny . <p> There 's the Polish-born Jack Gold , who strayed from his faith after the Germans slaughtered his family ( four-fifths of the Hasidim died in the Holocaust ) , then gravitated back to it in America when , as he puts it , " my wife start giving me , thank God , kids . " There 's Ben Zion Horowitz , a son of Holocaust survivors , who had never really spoken to a girl before letting his mother choose him a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having noted that the drab gray dresses Hasidic schoolgirls must wear are always four inches below the knee , boasts with a certain parochial pride that " Catholic schools are at least five inches above the knee . " <p> The two filmmakers met eight years ago , but this is their first substantial collaboration . Mr. Rudavsky , 40 , has produced work ranging from documentaries on Jewish themes to segments for " Prime Time Live " and MTV 's " Real World . " Though the son of a Reform rabbi , he is a largely nonobservant resident of the Upper West Side of Manhattan . Mr. Daum , 50 , born to Holocaust survivors in Poland , still wears a yarmulke and beard and lives in Borough Park , a largely Hasidic neighborhood . His past projects include documentaries on the elderly and the deaf . <p> Mr. Rudavsky 's approach to the subject was more distant and sentimental , fueled by memories of his beloved Hasidic grandfather ; Mr. Daum 's tie was more immediate  --  and indulgent . " I 'm tolerant of their intolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them slack . " <p> " Oren and I had a good synergy , " Mr. Daum continued recently over coffee and rugelach in Mr. Rudavsky 's office on Upper Broadway . " I can speak Yiddish with them , and if I put on a hat , I look like I belong even more than I do . I could assure them that this film would not mock or exploit them . Oren comes across as a sincere student of life , who has maybe strayed from the true path but is redeemable . " <p> The combination worked , gaining them entry not just to the Lubavitchers  --  historically the most accessible but arguably the least representative of all the Hasidic groups  --  to the other , more reclusive groups . <p> Still , for all the Hasidim who appear on camera , there are hundreds who refused to speak , or worse : one Bobover Hasid threw water on Mr. Rudavsky and tried to knock him off a ladder as he tried to film a Succoth celebration . Hasidic women , schooled in modesty , were especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often hid behind their hats or placed their hands over the camera . It was the older Hasidim , many of them survivors of the death camps , who were surprisingly cooperative , perhaps because they want their stories told at long last . <p> HASIDIM , THEIR families and faith largely shattered , began arriving in the United States in 1946 . It was the heyday of assimilation , when most Jews were intent upon inconspicuousness . Tentatively , hesitantly , the Hasidic survivors clustered anew around the few Rebbes who had survived , whose traditional importance in Europe was magnified amid the disoriented new Americans . <p> The communities grew  --  there are now approximately 200,000 Hasidim in North America , in addition to thousands in Israel  --  and grew both more confident and more self-sufficient and impermeable . More than the synagogues , it was their religious schools that mattered . Henya Gottesman , the principal of the Gerer girls ' school in Borough Park , describes matter-of-factly how none of her students have televisions in their homes , and how the books in the school 's library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from outside exposures , which we feel are detrimental to the kiddusha , the purity , of their neshamas , their souls , " she explains in the film . <p> Few go to college , effectively sentencing most of them , as Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg tells the filmmakers , to lives of penury . And women are reared to become Jewish mothers , again and again and again . To outsiders , this is degrading ; to Hasidim , it is exalting . " After 100 years who 's going to remember who ran Westinghouse , and who cares ? " explains Ms. Abromowitz , the haberdasher . " Your children will be a legacy forever . " <p> Of course , the Hasidim can not immure themselves completely ; the film is filled with scenes of them riding the subway , reading English-language newspapers , walking past X-rated-video stores . Professor Samuel Heilman of Queens College describes seeing a Satmar Hasid waiting on a scantily clad woman in a Manhattan electronics store , then wishing her a nice day . " That is already being swallowed up by America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other question to them , Mr. Daum and Mr. Rudavsky say , is how Hasidism has managed to survive . The filmmakers deliberately overlooked distinctions between Hasidic groups because , they insist , what unites the various Hasidic sects is far more important . <p> So , too , they admit , they played down the bitter and occasionally violent rivalries within or between groups . They ignore the much-publicized debate among Lubavitchers over whether the late Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson was  --  or is  --  the Messiah . So , too , they pass over the 1991 riot in Crown Heights , in which rampaging blacks killed a Lubavitcher Hasid , and touch only lightly on resentment among other minority groups that are convinced that New York City officialdom pampers the Hasidim . <p> There are also few references to black sheep among the black hats  --  white-collar crime and drug use go largely unexamined  --  because , the filmmakers maintain , those problems have been overstated . <p> " Frankly , I wish there were one sentence in the film that said , ' Just like any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , who cheat at business , who do drugs , who abuse their wives , who go to female or male prostitutes , ' " Mr. Rudavsky said with some exasperation . <p> He said one Jewish theater owner expressed reluctance to show the film precisely because it was so sympathetic to Hasidim ; the man feared that his largely Jewish audiences would n't like it . In Israel , where resentment against the ultra-Orthodox is even stronger , the documentary was recently rejected by the Jerusalem Film Festival . <p> This week , when the curtain goes up on " A Life Apart , " few Hasidim will be watching . But several who appear in the film attended screenings in January at the New York Jewish Film Festival and were touched by what they saw . When Mayer Horowitz , the survivor of a Bobover family wiped out during World War II , approached Mr. Daum and Mr. Rudavsky afterward , he had tears in his eyes . So , too , may some viewers after hearing Mr. Horowitz 's son , Ben Zion , describe family simchas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every grandchild that 's born , it 's like a stuch to the Germans , " he says , using the Yiddish word for jab . " We get together once a year , the whole family ; that was Hanukkah . I mean , you have to have earplugs because so many babies crying  --  it 's like so much noise . But for my father it 's the biggest pleasure , just to see 72 grandchildren and all of them have the names of his family  --  mother , father , grandfather . It 's like his family is alive again . "
