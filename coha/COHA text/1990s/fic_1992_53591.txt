SO MY BROTHER , Davis , went back to St. Louis , and for two weeks the house stayed crammed with funeral flowers . They tipped over in corners , shed petals and leaves onto the dining room sideboard . The ferns dried to brown powdery lace , and the yellow mums curled in on themselves ; the gladiolas lost their color and collapsed against their stalks until their ribbons were the brightest things about them . Mama and I stepped around them , squeezed past them and tracked brown fern dust all over the house . By the end of the second week , only the fragrance of gardenias lingered , though the fragile white flowers had been the first to die . By day , the smell of gardenias hid in the curtains and carpet threads , but at night it slipped loose and filled the house . One night when I woke , it seemed that even the moonlight that fell in broad white stripes across the floor of my bedroom smelled of that sweet flower , a blossom unfolding petal by petal , filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined that the house floated in it , and from the windows Mama 's face and mine looked out , mouthing " Help , " waiting for rescue . <p> The next morning , before Mama was awake , I gathered up the dead flowers and carried them out to the garbage cans in the backyard , behind the stand of bamboo that Papa had planted years earlier to screen the cans from sight . I made two trips , but on the third , as I was carrying out the last load , I noticed the weather and felt afraid . Overnight , it seemed , spring was coming , a warm current smuggled in on the underside of the cool March air . I could see my breath , and it was too cold to be out in a nightgown , but the tips of the hickory branches closest to the sky had swelled and turned pearly green , and the air had a silty smell . The winter in which my father had died was ending . I hurried back inside and followed the sound of the vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work  --  tennis shoes , a tired navy wraparound skirt , an Icelandic sweater broken through at the elbows  --  vacuuming up the last of the brown flower-dust from off of the ancient red Oriental carpet , and on the table there were stacks of heavy cream notecards , two fountain pens and bottles of black ink , a roll of stamps , and a list of names . " Time to do our thank-you notes , " she yelled over the roar of the upright . Then she shut it off and dragged it out of the room back to the hall closet . <p> The dining room was right in the middle of the house , and it was always cool and dim there . The sheer curtains that hung behind the tired wine-colored velvet drapes stayed drawn across the window , blurring and softening the light . The room smelled of candlewax and a peppery musk that seemed to be the essence of the smells of all the food that had ever been eaten there . The long , oval mahogany table took up most of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver bowl full of wax fruit and two glass candlesticks hung with crystals , in which there were always two white candles . On the matching sideboard under the gilt-framed mirror there was a silver service on a silver tray , and to each side of the mirror portraits of Great-great-grandmother and - grandfather Vess , and to each side of the portraits hung old-fashioned wall sconces that threw sour yellow fans of light up the cracked plaster walls . Through all the changes the house had undergone , this room stayed the same . <p> Thank-you notes . I sat down in my chair on one side of the table and looked at the list . Catherine ( Mrs. Buck ) Henderson  --  squash casserole . Pot of yellow mums . Miss Ruth Ashley  --  camellias , crab bisque . Miss Jenny Hanks  --  pineapple upside-down cake , dish garden . Thelma Reece , gladiola spray , ham . Four pages of names , single-spaced . I had n't written a thank-you note in years , not since Matthew and I had gotten married . Thank-you notes were part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . I had not even written any notes after Matthew died . In one of those talks you have about everything you will ever do together , everything you believe , Matthew and I had decided that when we died , we wanted no funerals , no flowers . We would leave this world , we promised one another , as simply as we 'd come into it . Right after he died , I held onto that promise we 'd made to one another , and I insisted . And so he 'd been cremated , and what flowers and food there had been  --  sent by relatives and old country neighbors of the Settles ' who could not imagine a death without flowers or grasp the logistics of sending flowers all the way to Pennsylvania  --  had gone to the Settles ' house in Cheraw , and Matthew 's mother had written what notes there were to write . <p> As she pulled her chair up to the head of the table and put on her half-moon reading glasses and filled her pen and picked up the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " I do n't know how to do this , Mother . " I said , " How do I start ? " <p> " Have you forgotten how to write a letter ? " she said , already writing . " You just thank people for what they did for us , " she said , " and you tell them how highly Daddy thought of them . " <p> So that was all there was to it . It was a relief to find something that simple . I picked up the first piece of paper and filled my pen . I looked at the first name on the list . Miss Ruth Ashley . Camellias . Mother 's head was bent ; she wrote swiftly , tipping her head back and forth as she wrote , admiring her work . Miss Ruth Ashley . I closed my eyes , reached way back . There was the smell of lavender cologne , a thin , severe-looking woman with brown hair , a fat chihuahua with bulging eyes , a small , neat greenhouse where my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped one stem into another , wound the stems tightly , wrapped them in plastic and burlap and set them on a shelf close to the glass . They treated one another with an elaborate and stylized formality , calling each other Miss Ashley , Mr. Vess . And once the wrapping came off and the graft had taken , it grew into a new camellia , clear white with bold red streaks running through the petals . Mr. John Vess , it was named . That is what Miss Ruth Ashley had sent . A bowl of them , floating in water . " Dear Miss Ashley , " I wrote , " you may not remember me as the child who tagged along with my father on those Saturday mornings when he came to your greenhouse to work , but I remember those mornings well and fondly . My father always said that you knew more about camellias than anyone in the state . " <p> Whenever I looked up , it seemed that the eyes of my great-great-grandparents watched from their portraits above the sideboard . What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seddell Palmer Vess watched , a seasick expression on his long , bony face , a palmetto cockade pinned to his tricornered hat , a sailing ship in the background . Elizabeth Hardee ( Har-DEE , as it is pronounced in the South Carolina lowcountry from which they came ) Vess watched , mildly aggrieved at what she saw . It was the same look of mild and haughty disapproval that had traveled down the generations and lodged in my grandmother Vess 's eyes , and in my father 's , and in my own sometimes , if I caught myself off guard . A look that said that whatever they were watching was less than it should have been , but what could you expect , people being who they were ? <p> Now I know that everyone claims that the eyes in their family portraits follow them around the room . Like having a murderer in your family or a crazy person , it gives you a mystery to point to , a way to raise your own character defects to tragic heights . But in this case it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vess seemed to look everywhere because their portraits had been painted by a clumsy painter who had no sense of perspective or proportion . Their eyes had been painted on either side of their heads like the eyes of insects or fish , and so they seemed to be looking at once in all directions . But the distortions did not end with their faces . Elizabeth Hardee Vess 's fingers looked eerily long , spindled on the head of a brown-and-white spaniel as though she were screwing the head onto the dog 's body . In the background of her portrait , if the space behind her can be called that  --  everything in these paintings exists on the same plane  --  three children so small as to be almost incomprehensible as human figures play in front of a dark forest wall . In the air above Seddell Vess 's right shoulder , as deserted and ghostlike as the Ancient Mariner 's ship , sails the ship that brought him and his family from England . The effect is dreamlike and modern , as though the painter had distorted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distance . <p> As it turned out , the painter had been no colonial prodigy , only a man with no experience at portrait painting , desperate to feed his family , whose knowledge of perspective ended at foreground . These had been his first portraits , and though he struggled half a year with the paintings , he was never paid a penny for his work . The portraits , however , had been passed down reverently , their oddness triumphed over , turned to proof , finally , of the Vesses ' standing in the colony , while the story of the painter cheated out of his money grew into a fable about the admirable rectitude of these early Vesses . <p> I had laughed about them all my life , their warped , spooky figures and the fantastic stories that had grown up to dignify these distortions , but as I looked at them and wrote the thank-you notes , it seemed that I saw something else about them . I saw that beneath that warped surface of which so much had been made in this family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were people once , they were mortals . They might have once sat grieving on a day just like this one for the two children they lost during their first year in the New World . I have seen their graves down near Beaufort , two girls , Elizabeth and Amelia , who died within a week of each other in the autumn of 1798 . They might have stood beside their children 's graves and felt their mortality as a truth for the first time in their lives , and how it connected them with everyone else in the world . Because mortality is not something you can know until it touches you , until you see that it 's not something that happens to you , it 's something you are . And knowing that is like being let in on a secret about everyone else in the world as well . <p> The best notes I read to Mother . " Dear Fanny and Charles , " I wrote one day , " We thank you for the beautiful pot of mums you sent to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you both and valued your friendship . He especially enjoyed coming out to your place every year for pecans . He always said that your trees grew the sweetest pecans in the county . " As I wrote that , I remembered : they were long , smooth-shelled pecans , light and creamy brown , that almost always slipped out of the shell whole . As she listened , Mother capped her pen and folded her hands on the table , her chin high , her eyes bright and moving , as though she were watching Fanny and Charles Gregorie on their farm on the Stamp Creek Road , the collapsing equipment sheds , the shaggy pony standing in grass up to his withers , the mean rooster we dodged as we crossed the yard toward the sheds , the long , vaulted aisles of the pecan grove . " Oh , honey , " she said , when I 'd finished , " that 's just beautiful . " <p> And then she read one to me . " Dear Sara , Thank you so much for the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think about what good friends we all were . Remember the times we went square dancing together on Saturday nights ? I was looking through some pictures the other day and I saw us in those funny skirts and cowgirl blouses . They were a sight , were n't they ? And did n't the men look handsome in their spangled shirts ? It 's hard to believe that John and DeLeon are both gone now and that we must go on without them . " <p> " You did go dancing , did n't you ? " I said . <p> " Almost every Saturday night . Do you remember that ? " <p> " I remember how pretty you looked in that red taffeta skirt with all the sequins on it . I thought you looked like a gypsy . And I remember sitting on the floor with Davis back in you all 's room eating popcorn and watching Jackie Gleason on TV while Penny sat in a straight-backed chair in the middle of the doorway . She looked so grim ; I always thought you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " You remember all that ? " <p> " Right now I do . " <p> With each note , I felt calmer , clearer . The world might be all flux and whirl , but I had found a place that was still , and in this place I knew who I was and who I had been . Because home is the place where things come back to you , I thought . I wrote my father 's name , connected it with other names , conjured his presence in the room , kept him close a little bit longer , the way he had always been . <p> We worked for a week and we wrote 150 thank-you notes ; I kept a tally on one of Mother 's bridge scorepads . And then , three weeks to the day after Papa 's funeral , I took the last batch down to the post office , and when the door to the metal mailbox clanked shut and I heard the envelopes hit and scatter in the bottom , I felt the way I 'd felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load of flowers from my father 's funeral . Just exactly like some timid animal , I thought , caught out in the open and panicking , looking for the closest cover . It made me so angry to feel that way that I drove the long way home , all the way around the bypass and back . I even made myself turn onto a road I did n't know and find my way from there , just for practice . Still , after I 'd gotten home and eased Mother 's car into the space in the garage  --  where it just fits between the stacks of cast-off chairs and towers of old clay flowerpots that have accumulated there over the years  --  and started for the house , I felt that same sense . What now ? What next ? And silence where an answer should have been . <p> Luckily , Mother had the answer , as she seemed to have the answers to so many questions I had n't even asked . When I got back from the post office , she was waiting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said as I started up the steps , as though I 'd shown up late for an appointment , but at least I was there . <p> The back porch used to be a sleeping porch , screened above , latticed below , where my father and his brother , Stovall , had slept in hot weather . It was , my father always said , a wonderful place to sleep : cool , open , out under the stars . They had slept there the night before Stovall left for Europe during World War II , where he was killed on his first parachute jump into France . My father had slept there the night before his wedding . Since we 'd lived in the house , it had been Papa 's porch , strictly his . There , he 'd collected everything that Mama banished from the house : dog things and hunting things , oily things and boyhood things . Sometimes he still slept there on hot summer nights , or on cool nights when only he and Mother knew the reason , on a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coming in from a date , I would sometimes find him stretched out there with all his clothes on , his hands behind his head , looking out into the night sky . " Hello , Champ , " he 'd say . " Papa , " I 'd answer , and hurry on into the kitchen , anxious to allow him ( and myself ) the dignity of pretending that his being there was the most natural thing in the world . It was the last place I 'd imagined him alive , on the morning Mama had called , and all his things were still there : the map and the dog-food sacks , the rusted lengths of chain and the bed , stripped of its sheets and blankets now , and with the mattress rolled up and tied with string , still showing the rust marks of the mesh that had supported it . <p> " Come help me get these old birds out of here , " she said as she unlatched the screen door and swung it open . She slipped off the Vess diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without looking , she felt for the key that hung from a nail by a piece of jute twine on one of the uprights and lifted the lid of the freezer chest that sat against the back wall . A cloud of cold steam rose from inside the box , smelling faintly of blood , and she stepped back , fanning it away from her face . <p> Down in the basement , a larger freezer held vegetables and meat and ice cream , but this one was Papa 's , and it was full of the birds he hunted every fall . Ten years ' worth of frozen dove and quail . Now she wanted to get rid of them . Why ? Fear , like a little pulse , beat in my chest . <p> " Why throw them out , Mother ? " I said , keeping my voice calm . " They 're frozen ; they 'll keep . " <p> She looked at me as though I were being willfully , stubbornly dense . " Because I never liked them anyway , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Like what ? " I bit my lip as soon as the words left my mouth . The question defeated her . I had forgotten that too , the way you go forward again after you lose someone you love , moving carefully , your hands out in front of you . Balance is all . Momentum . And if someone stops you , says Look down , ' you see where you are , and you fall . <p> " Well , I just might like to freeze some fruit this summer , " she said , her chin trembling , her eyes full of warning . <p> " I 'll get a garbage bag , " I said . <p> It is comforting to think that death makes you meek and gentle , that it breaks and changes and humbles you . It changes you , all right , only sometimes it makes you fierce , it makes you itch to avenge yourself on the person who has done this . But where is he ? Come back here , coward , you say . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantry for the box of garbage bags , this is revenge , I understand revenge . After Matthew died , I sat down one night with some of his jackets that I was going to give to the Salvation Army , but instead of folding them , I began to take them apart . I found a ripped seam on the sleeve of one jacket and I opened it with my finger , then I got my scissors and cut the threads that held the seams together , but scissors were too clumsy , the work went too fast . So I got out my seam ripper and began to rip out the seams and linings stitch by stitch . I ripped the pockets , the collars . It 's amazing how intricately clothing is put together . When I was done with the jackets , I started on his pants , then his shirts . I worked most of the night and when I was done Matthew 's clothes were laid out around the chair like hides . And I sat there feeling drained and satisfied , but not angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would have nothing to wear . That anger after ten years of marriage . What store had she accumulated in thirty ? <p> Mother emerged from the freezer with frost on the arms of her sweater and a freezer bag in each hand . She held them up and shook them . Inside , the frozen birds shifted in their nests of frost , feathers , claws , beaks , pale scaly-ridded eyes . Without a word , she held them out to me , her mouth grim . " Look at this , " she said . " He did n't know any more about freezing things than the man in the moon , " she said . She dropped two frozen birds into the garbage bag that I held open at my feet , then stood on tiptoe again and plunged back into the freezer chest . <p> " These birds are n't plucked , Mother , " I said . I did n't mean to sound reproachful , but I heard my own twelve-year-old voice speaking to her , protecting my father , accusing her of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Priss , " she said from inside the freezer chest . " I just put my foot down finally . I told him , ' I 'm not going to pick those things for you any longer , John , or clean fish either one . You want to bring dead animals into this house , you 're responsible for them . ' " She came up then , with frost on her hair ' holding an armful of freezer bags stacked on top of one another . " You know what John 's biggest problem was ? " she said , steadying the bags close to her chest . <p> " What , Mother ? " I said , though she was n't talking to me , not to me personally . She was talking to someone listening , to an ear down which she could pour her grievances until they filled up head and heart . And I felt a sudden loss of altitude inside , the way I 'd always felt , taken aside by each of them and loaded up with their disappointments with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the bewildering things that had happened since my father died , this was the worst , the way she hated him , the way her memories of him were hard , not soft , as if what she had to keep telling herself was how impossible he was . <p> " His mother babied him until the day she died , " she said , her eyes widening angrily , her mouth stubborn . She was working furiously now , throwing the frozen birds into the bag so hard they clattered like stones . The bag was cold against my legs , and already the birds had begun to thaw , the frost had melted inside some of the bags , leaving the birds looking puckered and dull . " Do you know what she told me just before she died ? She said , ' John 's a good boy . He always put his mother first , ' can you imagine ? Well , after she died , I broke the news to him , ' Time to grow up , John . ' " She nodded sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bag I was holding . The whole mess landed on my foot and I felt tears come up in my eyes . Seeing them , Mother 's tone softened . " You see , he thought he could do anything he wanted and everyone would love him for it , " she said , holding up a freezer bag by the corner . Then she looked at what was in her arms and her face was the face of someone on a ledge who finally looks down . " Oh , " she said in a thin voice , and I saw that in the bag she was holding , the one from the bottom of the freezer , the birds lay together , smooth and white , not a feather on them . She smoothed out the bag on top as tenderly if she were stroking a baby 's head . " Of course I did it for him for years . It did n't ever occur to me that I did n't have to until women 's lib came along . " <p> " Oh , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lib . When did you give a hoot about women 's lib ? " It was the wrong thing to say , of course ; her version of things means more to her than any fact . Her eyes went flat as nail heads . I can not look at my mother when she is angry ; it seems dangerous to do it , like staring too long at a wild animal , you might provoke it to spring . And now I realized , with a crawling sensation that began at the bottom of my spine and worked its way up until it exploded in my head like light , that there were no men to step between us . No Papa to gentle her down , say , " Easy , Queenie , easy , let it go . " No Matthew to touch my shoulder , say , " Let 's go for a walk . " Just me and Mother who watched me that way while I watched the frost in the bags of dove melt . " Well , whose side are you on anyway ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief to have it put so simply . I set down my garbage bag and , remembering the way she 'd been with me about Matthew , the swift mercy of fact , I took the bag of dove out of her hand . " Give me that , Mama , " I said , " the argument 's over . " <p> " Is that right ? " she said . And she sat down all of a sudden on the folding metal chair next to the freezer  --  a chair like the chairs set in rows under the Taylor Brothers tent at Papa 's funeral , only this one was all rust  --  and folded forward as though something had deflated inside her , and rested her elbows on her knees and covered her face with her hands . Her shoulders began to shake . " Go on , Mama , get it out , " I said , " I 'm here . " It is more frightening to remember love than bitterness or anger , I know  --  but remember it you do , you will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you everywhere you turn . And when it comes , you have to go with it . Because grief rises like a tide and like a tide it falls , but unlike the tide no one can chart its cycles , and to survive you must let each wave carry you and allow it to set you down . Else you exhaust yourself in struggling against its power , because the power of grief is the same as the power of love ; it comes from the same source , and you can drown there if you fight it . <p> I knelt down beside her and put my hand on her arm . I wanted to say something tender and steadying , but the wave caught me , too , and I wrapped my arms around her knees and laid my head in her lap and let go . She kept her hand on my hair and cried , and I cried too , the kind of crying you do when you feel this core of sadness down inside of you and you feel that if you could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . I cried until I thought I 'd touched the bottom of the sadness this time . That 's the relief of crying like that : you think you 've reached down deep enough , that you 've scooped out the last of it . It fills back up again , of course , the way a hole dug in the sand at the beach fills up with water , but for the moment you think you 've gotten it all . <p> " Such a waste , " Mother said , wiping her cheeks with the palms of both hands . " My mother used to say that wasting food was a black sin . " <p> I wiped my own eyes and got up from my knees . At that moment , things seemed very clear . She needed me , I needed her , we needed each other . We could help each other through this time and other times as well . We knew each other all the way back . " They 're probably all freezer-burned by now , Mother , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother would understand that , do n't you think ? " <p> " She might have . We 'll never know that now , will we ? " She braced her hands on her knees and pushed herself up and went back over to the freezer , one hand on the small of her back , as though it ached . She waved away the steam and stared down into the empty freezer . " All those little bones , " she said . " Those things were the dickens to eat anyway . " She shuddered . Her eyes were red-rimmed when she looked my way again . " Lord , " she said , " just let me hold onto my faculties long enough to take care of my own affairs before I die and not leave things for my children to clean up after me . " She slammed the lid on the freezer , locked it , hung the key back on the nail on the upright behind the chest . Then she reached around behind the freezer and pulled the plug . <p> And then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama put on her sewing glasses and went back to work on the Carolina Gamecock pillow she was cross-stitching , in shades of red and black , for my cousin Melody Givens ' fiance , Canady , who was a big Gamecock fan . It is time for me to go back to Pennsylvania , I thought , but something had happened to time . It slowed until it seemed that we moved through the days like swimmers in thick liquid while the clock measured off the lengths of time with a slow , steady clucking . It was the clock from Grandfather Vess 's office at the hardware store , and it was made of mahogany and glass and steepled like a church . <p> Sitting quietly while the strutting Gamecock formed out of the repetitions of Mama 's needle , I 'd close my eyes and listen to the March rain passing over us and the clock and the sound of Mama 's needle as it poked through the canvas , and I imagined a circle slowly woven around me again , filled with familiar people , places and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead would leave there finally and forever . No wonder people take vows and live in cloisters all their lives . In a cloister there is a wall around the world . You know what is in , what is out , and where you belong . Remember Gulliver on the shore , tied down with thousands of Lilliputian ropes ? The picture books all show him waking up terrified , fighting his tethers . But if I could draw , I would show him rejoicing , after the terrors of the ocean , to find himself pinned so tightly to the earth again . <p> When my supervisor called from Westinghouse Learning Systems , a month after Papa 's funeral , to find out when they could expect me to come back to work , I caught the phone on its first ring . When I heard who it was , I cupped my hand around the receiver , though Mother was across the kitchen in the den , and explained in a low voice that Mother still needed me . It was all terribly complicated , I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still to be unraveled . None of that was true . I stood on tiptoe and looked at Mother , sewing in the den . Glasses pulled halfway down her nose , the pillow in her lap , she frowned at the TV , disapproving . She needed no one . And my father had left nothing to chance or anyone 's whim . <p> What he had left was a wide , well-marked path for Owen Gandy , the lawyer , to follow . The trail began in the safety deposit box down at the First Commercial Bank of Timmons , where there were keys , each labeled with a numbered tag , and life insurance policies and savings passbooks , also numbered . In case we might be confused by the numbers , there was a note : " See top right hand drawer in home office . Red spiral-bound notebook . " There , each number matched a description of the article and instruction , also numbered 1 , 2 , 3 in Papa 's tall broad handwriting . There had been nothing for anyone to do but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us. $75,000 each to me and Davis ; the rest , of course , went to Mother . <p> My supervisor cleared his throat . " Well , I guess we 'll have to start looking for someone to take your place . Temporarily , of course , " he said . " We hope you 'll be coming back to us . " <p> " Maybe you 'd better go on and do that , " I said . " Just temporarily . " After I hung up , I sat down in the absurd little chair that was part of the absurd little ' 50s blond wood telephone table  --  the kind with an attached seat and curving lines , that somehow goes with the word housewife and aprons and casseroles and club meetings  --  that sat on the dark wood floor next to the peeling radiator , against the faded pink wallpaper in the hall in Mother 's house . What was it doing here ? I knew that , too . One of Mama 's fizzled crusades to modernize this house . But Papa liked it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The house , and Papa , always won . No matter how many of what she called her " touches " she put into it , the house went on being all dark varnish and heavy drapes and blackened silver frames on the photographs that lined the wall in this dark , narrow hall . <p> I sat there listening , and it seemed as if I heard my blood rushing through my veins . I thought of what I had wanted to say to my brother , Davis , before he left for St. Louis , when he did n't want to take anything of my father 's with him and insisted that I drop him off at the Delta baggage-claim area in front of the terminal without even coming inside to say goodbye . Do n't you know , Davis , I 'd wanted to say , that we must hold onto things ? Because death is so empty , so light and full of space and endless , the smallest object or memory is weight in the palm , and ballast , a dot on a map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become weightless , like ash , and blow away . And then I said to myself , out loud , the way you say to yourself the heart-stopping thing that you meant to say the moment before , only you did n't have the nerve : " Ed , " I said , " you need to find somebody else to work for you because I am going home . " And I felt as though I had just surprised myself sneaking back into my body , the way I used to sneak back into this house as a teenager , at dawn after wandering around the county half the night , drinking from a bottle of Old Mr. Boston gin and looking for a way to lose myself . <p> <p> By PAM DURBAN <p>
