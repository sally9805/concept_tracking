The rules change radically when whitetails become swamp creatures By Gary Clancy // Long before I ever hunted deer , I knew that deer in general , and big bucks in particular , spent a lot of time in places seemingly better suited to muskrats and mallards . My father was a duck hunting nut , and from the time I was four I accompanied him on forays into a maze of dark-water channels , narrow guts and potholes all carved out of a sea of cattails that dad simply called the " duck slough . " It was not unusual to see a deer or two standing in the cattails at any time , but when the firearm deer season opened , we could count on seeing the big boys . Dad was not a deer hunter , but since the opening of deer season usually coincided with the first real good push of ducks out of Canada , we were typically in the marsh on opening weekend of deer season . We often would see a buck or two swimming the channel in that gray time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Then , when the distinctive crackwhump of the first slugs being fired echoed in the timber surrounding the marsh , we could count on seeing another buck or two . Several even swam through our decoy patterns over the years . I never forgot those marsh monsters . Years later , when I first became a deer hunter , my friends thought I was crazy as I headed for the marsh instead of the timber . They did n't think I was quite so nuts when I returned with one of those marsh monsters in the bed of my ' 50 Ford pickup . That buck field-dressed 237 pounds , carried a thick , gnarly eightpoint rack and had lived in the marsh for so long that the hair on his legs and belly had been dyed Black Angus black . He was the first buck I ever mounted , and even today , when I look at him , I can smell the rankness of the marsh mud and hear the hiss of wind through frost-nipped cattails . THE FOUR FACTORS Hunting deer in a cattail swamp is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattails and wading in there expecting to find a big buck . Go at it that way and all you 'll do is spend a lot of time sloshing around to no effect in some pretty tough territory . Deer like big marshes , the bigger the better . One of my favorite places to hunt is a 17-mile stretch of narrow , twisting marsh fringed with thick cattails and tall phragmites . Hundreds , maybe thousands , of deer call that marsh home . It is where I killed that Black Angus buck . Most hunters are intimidated by getting deep into a large marsh and content themselves hunting the fringe . Deer learn that hunters haunt the edges , so they go deeper into the marsh , to places where they do n't figure to be disturbed . So size is the first factor to consider when selecting a marsh to hunt . The second factor that affects how inviting a marsh will be to a whitetail is the availability of dry ground . An old buck will stand and even bed in water and mud for a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hide , but a deer will not set up housekeeping in a marsh that does not afford dry places to bed . A third factor that comes into play is the availability of other good cover . Cattail sloughs become attractive to deer when other good bedding cover is scarce or dangerous for them . If a region has plenty of heavy timber and brush where deer can lay up without being disturbed , they see no reason to get their feet wet . The fourth factor that will determine whether or not deer use the cattails is hunting pressure . In many areas nowadays , this is the most important factor . A deer remembers places where it can go when the hunting pressure is on . And once a deer has been introduced to the cattails , it will use the sanctuary of the marsh when it senses hunter activity . HOW TO SCOUT A MARSH Nothing beats a bird's-eye view when it comes to scouting a marsh . If you 're serious about hunting through the cattails , renting a small plane is the way to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times . On the first pass just try to get an overall picture of the marsh established in your memory bank . On the second and third flyovers , start to look for trails , islands of dry ground , open grassy areas , deepwater channels and pockets of open water . Fly over again and mark these features on an aerial photograph , a topo or even a hand-drawn map . Use the final pass to take your own photos of the marsh . Photograph Big bucks seek the security-and dry islands-that a marsh provides when hunting pressure mounts . // If flying is not an option or if the cattail marsh you plan to hunt is small enough that you feel flying over it would be a waste of money , pull on your waders and scout on foot . Following deer trails is the easiest way to scout a marsh on foot . Pushing through cattails is tough even for deer , so they tend to stick to well-used and clearly defined trails . Pick up a trail exiting the cattails and backtrack it . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedding area on dry ground . You will find that the deer tend to take the easy way whenever possible , following old roadways or berms and avoiding the muck anytime they can tread on firm bottom . And although deer are excellent swimmers , they usually skirt open water , preferring to walk instead of swim across . Some dry-ground bedding areas are easy to identify because of the presence of trees-usually willows or cottonwoods-or shrubs such as red osier . But when relatively dry ground is indicated only by the presence of phragmites or low slough grass , locating bedding areas becomes more difficult . Do n't get discouraged if you lose the trail you are following . Try to cut another trail and continue the search . Keep looking until you have found several bedding areas . At least there wo n't be any mistaking a bedding area . Since dry ground is at a premium in most marshes , beds , droppings and converging trails will be numerous . Think big when searching for bedding areas . Marshes are full of tiny hummocks and islands , spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But hunting these spots is a long shot . You 're much better off focusing your energies on large bedding areas , which will attract a number of deer on a consistent basis . One of the things I like about hunting the cattails is that the deer use the same trails and share general bedding areas . There is none of this searching for skinny big-buck-only trails or solitary hideaways . You can count on the biggest buck in the swamp using the same trail system as all of the other deer . SEX IN THE SWAMP For many years I was convinced that when the rut kicked in , bucks that made their homes in marshes were forced to frolic in the surrounding woodlands . When it came time for doing what bucks do during the rut , namely making rubs and scrapes and chasing does , it was an away game for marsh deer . So I thought . Then Jim Hill , a Minnesota-based bowhunter who probably knows more about hunting big bucks in cattails than any man ever to strap on a pair of hipboots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not totally wrong . Marsh monsters do make rubs and scrapes and frolic with the does in the surrounding woodlands , but nearly all of that activity takes place at night . During the daylight hours , bucks content themselves by patrolling those relatively dry grassy openings within the boundaries of the marsh that you found while scouting . These are the places where masters of the marsh like Jim Hill will build their blinds . Rattling , calling and decoys are deadly medicine in these places during the rut . STAND-HUNTING A MARSH A rifleman perched atop a tripod stand is in a good position to take a marsh monster . You will need to place a three-foot-square piece of plywood under each leg of the tripod to keep the supports from sinking into the soft bottom . Position the tripod so you can cover several trails and an opening or two . Some hunters like to tromp down shooting lanes extending from the tripod like the spokes of a wheel . If you sit still , marsh deer will usually ignore a hunter in a tripod stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marsh and deer are not in the habit of looking up for danger . Or it may be that a tripod that is properly positioned well before the season becomes accepted by the deer as part of the exotic growth in the swamp . Whatever the reason , I know several bowhunters who use these with good results . Photograph Photograph // Although I have tried bowhunting from a tripod stand and have seen deer literally walk between the legs , I feel my chances of taking a mature buck with a bow are better from a ground blind . Photograph // Prior to the rut or following it , build a blind along a well-used trail or at the intersection of two or more good trails . But during the rut , a blind along one of those grassy openings will put you at the heart of the action . The blind does n't have to be elaborate . Early in the season you can usually just hunker down in the cattails and cut a few narrow shooting slots . But later in the season , when the cattails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong breezes , you will need to build a blind . Well away from the intended site , use a saw or machete to cut several armfuls of cattails . Stick the ends of the cattails into the mud to form an oval-shaped blind with the entrance facing in the direction where you least expect to see deer . Make narrow shooting slits in the cattails . I like to position the blind so that I can cover one or more trails entering the opening and part of the opening itself . If there are so many trails you ca n't decide which one to cover-and you will find this is a common problem in hunting marshesyou can block off trails and reroute the deer to the trail or trails you can cover ( see diagram ) . A common mistake is that hunters position themselves high enough to see over the tops of the cattails . Resist this temptation . Deer will pick you out in a heartbeat if your noggin is sticking up over the vegetation . Look through , not over , the cattails . Folding stools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattails are high , but for most late-season situations you will be too high on a bucket or stool . A mud stool is the answer . You can make your own by following the instructions on the previous page , or you can purchase a Tote Stool for about $30 ( PS Manufacturing Co. , 202 South Second Street , Guthrie Center , IA 50115 ; 800-695-8012 ) . Specify that you want the adjustable model . Photograph Sidebar Trying to drive deer in a large marsh is an exercise in futility , but smaller sloughs lend themselves well to two- and three-man drives . Drivers should slowly walk through the slough in a zigzag pattern , stopping often to unnerve deer , which have a tendency to hold very tight in the cattails . After all , the cattails are the best escape cover they know of , so they are reluctant to abandon them . Mature bucks might have to be almost literally kicked from their beds .

Sidebar Here 's a quick way to make your own mud stool-the perfect late-season marsh perch : 1 ) Drill a 1 1/8-inch hole through the center of the bottom board ( the hole should be at least 1/8-inch larger than the dowel because the dowel will swell as it absorbs water ) . 2 ) Drill a 3/4-inch hole through the center of the seat board . 3 ) Sand or grind the top inch of a four-footlong length of one-inch doweling until it fits loosely into the hole in the seat board . 4 ) A radiator clamp hose works well for adjusting the seat height . Sidebar Here is a common problem you will encounter when hunting a large cattail marsh . You have found a nice-sized grass island , but there are six trails entering it .
