Good Habits to Develop <p> Following certain practices in shopping and storing foods will help to keep them safe . Many of these practices simply involve common sense . All are easy to follow . Yet , from time to time , they need to be restated as reminders until they become habitual . <p> Before shopping for food , make a list . Arrange the items in sequence , first listing those that are shelf-stable , such as canned sardines or boxes of brown rice ; at the bottom of the list , perishable items that are refrigerated , frozen , or hot deli foods . The sequence of the list may not conform to the food store layout . But , if you shop there frequently and are familiar with the layout , you will be able to locate items readily . If you shop in an unfamiliar store , make a dry-run before placing items in the shopping cart . <p> If you plan to do numerous errands that require many stops , try to make food shopping the last stop before returning home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the car . The chest is especially helpful in hot weather in order to keep perishable foods cool and to maintain the quality in frozen items such as ice cream . <p> After arriving home , store the foods in the reverse order of your shopping list . Promptly store frozen items in the freezer and perishable ones in the refrigerator . If you have purchased hot deli foods and plan to use them later , divide the food into small portions in shallow containers and refrigerate or freeze them . Shelf-stable foods can be stored at leisure . <p> Safe Perishable Food Selections . If you request to have meat ground to order , ascertain that the meat grinder is cleaned daily and cleaned between grindings of raw pork and beef or lamb . Reject any packaged meat , fish , poultry , or dairy products that are warm to the touch or have torn or damaged packaging . Bring such potentially risky items to the attention of the section or store manager . <p> At the checkout counter , note if the bagger automatically places your purchased meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this practice is not store policy , request that the bagger double-wrap these items to prevent any leakage of juices from raw flesh foods onto other foods in your shopping bag or , later , in your refrigerator . Or , you can double-bag such items yourself by using plastic bags available to customers at the produce section . <p> For safety , select pasteurized dairy products . Choose only egg cartons that are refrigerated . ( Some stores feature egg sale " specials " and merely pile the cartons , unrefrigerated , in aisles . ) Open the egg carton carefully , and reject any with cracked , broken , or dirty eggs . <p> In choosing produce , examine bags of apples or oranges , and reject any that contain bruised , moldy , or otherwise unacceptable low-quality fruit . Select potatoes stored in brown paper bags that exclude light . If you choose loose potatoes from a bin , reject any that are green-skinned and/or have developed " eyes " and sprouts . <p> Do not be tempted to purchase produce offered at greatly reduced prices for quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Safe Shelf-Stable Food Selections . Examine canned goods carefully . Reject any cans that bulge , leak , or have dents on the seam or rim . Cans must be intact . However , minor dents may not impair safety . <p> Packaged foods should be well sealed and show no signs of leakage . <p> Bulk food bins should be covered and well closed . Each bin should have its own scoop . Make certain that binned staple foods are fresh . Unless there is a rapid turnover of such foods , flours , grains , nuts , and seeds can become rancid . <p> Safe Practices in Freezing and Thawing Foods . Many supermarket wrappings are permeable to air . If you plan to freeze foods , overwrap the original packaging with tight , heavy-duty foil , plastic wrap , freezer paper , or additional plastic bags . <p> Proper packaging helps to prevent freezer burn . Improper or inadequate packaging causes this condition , which denotes deteriorated quality . However , the meat is still safe . <p> In freezing foods at home for future use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plan to rotate by using the longest stored items first . Shrimp and shellfish can be frozen safely up to a year , and raw fish , up to six months ; whole chicken or turkey , up to a year , and in parts , up to nine months ; steaks and roasts , from four months to a year , and ground meats and organ meats , three to four months ; and home-cooked meats , two to three months . <p> Thaw frozen foods properly to keep them safe . Although freezing foods to 0 degreesF inactivates most microbes such as bacteria , yeasts , and molds , it does not destroy them . After food is thawed , any microbes already present can become active once more , and under favorable conditions can multiply to high levels and may result in foodborne illnesses . <p> According to experts , there are three ways to defrost foods safely : in the refrigerator , in cold water , and in the microwave oven . Food thawed in the refrigerator is safe to be refrozen without cooking . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it takes time for frozen food to thaw . <p> For safety , marinate meat in the refrigerator . The marinade can be added to cooked foods but should not be used uncooked . <p> Safe Practices in Refrigerating Foods . The cool temperature of the refrigerator helps to maintain the freshness of perishable foods and keeps them safe by inhibiting or retarding the growth of most bacteria . However , some food spoilage microorganisms continue to grow and multiply in refrigerated foods . One example is Listeria monocytogenes . ( See " Food for Thought , " CR , November 1991 . ) <p> Maintaining freshness in refrigerated produce varies with different foods . You can see food quality declining when broccoli florets turn yellow , celery and lettuce go limp , and apple skins shrivel . Plan to use produce at its prime . Use perishable foods before they show signs of decline . For example , plan to use watercress promptly , and reserve cabbage for later use . Discard any food that becomes moldy , slimy , or foul-smelling . <p> Keep a thermometer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temperature of 40 degreesF or lower in the appliance . Check the temperature periodically . Although 40 degreesF may be suitable for summertime , the cold control may need to be adjusted for wintertime , to prevent milk , lettuce , green peppers , and other stored items from freezing . <p> If a table or shelf is accessible close to the refrigerator , get into the habit of gathering all items you plan to put into or take out of the appliance at one time . This practice eliminates needless openings and closings of the refrigerator door , and helps maintain a constant interior temperature in the appliance . <p> Do not overload the refrigerator . Air must circulate freely to cool all foods evenly . On the other hand , the freezer works efficiently when it is well stocked with foods , with a minimum of air . <p> Transfer any unused portions of foods from open cans to inert containers with covers and refrigerate them . Metals and other substances in cans , once opened and in the presence of oxygen , can interact unfavorably with food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , store them in plastic wrap , leak-proof bags , or air-tight containers . Store meat , poultry , and fish in the coldest part of the refrigerator  --  usually at the back . Keep eggs in their original cartons , and place them on a refrigerator shelf , not in the built-in egg slots provided in some refrigerator doors . <p> Clean the refrigerator and freezer regularly . Remove any spoiled food to avoid having bacteria pass from one food to another . Remove any mold that develops inside or outside of the appliance . <p> Safe Practices in Storing Shelf-Stable Foods . Store shelf-stable foods in a clean , dry , cool place . If you store them in cabinets , make certain that they are away from the cookstove or refrigerator 's exhaust . Extreme heat ( over 100 degreesF ) or extreme cold ( below 32 degreesF ) may harm canned goods . Otherwise , they are safe to use even if stored for lengthy time periods . <p> Low-acid canned foods , such as meat and poultry , stews , soups ( except tomato ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beans , beets , peas , and pumpkins can be stored from two to five years . High-acid canned foods , such as tomato products , fruits , sauerkraut , and foods in vinegar-based sauces or dressings , can be stored for 12 to 18 months . Some canned hams are shelf-stable , but make certain that they are . Any canned hams labeled " keep refrigerated " must be treated as perishable . <p> Store packages of flour and dried fruits in insect- and rodent-proof containers . Once a container is opened , remove the food from the original packaging , transfer it to a tightly closed impermeable container , and label it . <p> Safe Practices in Preparing Foods . Bacteria multiply rapidly between 40 degreesF and 140 degreesF , termed the " danger zone . " Harmful bacteria that cause many cases of food poisoning can not be seen , smelled , or tasted . It is important to keep cold foods cold ( 40 degreesF or lower ) and hot foods hot ( above 140 degreesF ) . Never allow perishable foods to remain at room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , even less time . In practical terms , this may mean that you have to excuse yourself from the dinner table to refrigerate the remains of a roast and other foods . <p> Plan to use cooked refrigerated foods within a few days . Reheat them thoroughly . <p> Other rules for safe food-handling in preparation are practices that deserve frequent repetition . Practice good personal hygiene . Wash your hands thoroughly in hot , soapy water before preparing foods and after handling raw flesh foods such as meat , poultry , or fish . Use a nail brush . Keep the food preparation area safe . Keep clean all utensils , can opener , counters , cutting boards , sponges , dishrags , and sink . Dirty dishrags and sponges are notorious breeders of pathogens . They should be sterilized and/or replaced frequently . Keep the area free of insects and rodents . Do not allow pets to climb on work surfaces . All of those practices , although acknowledged , are not always followed . When they become habitual , they help to keep food safe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been determined by the manufacturers of products . There is some leeway . The product may still be satisfactory and safe for a short time after expiration of the " use by " date . <p> As long as a product is wholesome , it is legal for a retailer to sell fresh and processed meat and poultry products beyond the expiration dates on the packages . <p> Federal regulations require a " use by " date on baby foods as well as on infant feeding formula products . Make certain that the dates on these products have not expired . <p> Dating on other products is not required by federal regulations . However , at least 26 states require dating for some perishable foods . <p> " Sell by " dates guide the store manager to determine how long to offer a product for sale . If you find that a product is being offered with an expired date , bring it to the attention of the section or store manager . <p> " Best if used by " or " Best if used before " is not a safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor or quality in a product . <p> " Closed or Coded dates " are packing numbers that are useful for manufacturers to track products . This dating permits manufacturers to rotate their stocks and locate their products in the unfortunate event of a problem that makes it necessary to recall a product . Seven Key Foodborne Pathogens <p> Symptoms from Campylobacter jejuni infections range from a mild illness with diarrhea lasting a day , to severe abdominal pain , severe diarrhea ( sometimes bloody ) , sometimes accompanied by fever , occasionally lasting for several weeks . The incubation period for most cases is two to five days and the illness usually lasts from two to 10 days , depending on its severity . Although the illness is generally regarded as a relatively mild disease , death can occur in some cases , especially for the very young , very old , or immunocompromised . <p> Illness from Clostridium perfringens intoxications typically occurs six to 24 hours after ingestion of food bearing large counts of this bacterium . The illness in humans is frequently a mild gastrointestinal distress , lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Escherichia coli O157:H7 disease is usually a mild gastrointestinal illness that occurs three to five days after eating contaminated food . However , E. coli O157:H7 disease can result in illness requiring hospitalization : hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome ( HUS ) . Hemorrhagic colitis is distinguished by the sudden onset of severe abdominal cramps , little or no fever , and diarrhea that may become grossly bloody . Although less than 5% of E. coli O157:H7 disease cases develop HUS , it is a severe , life-threatening illness . HUS is a disease characterized by red blood cell destruction , kidney failure , and neurological complications , such as seizures and strokes . Most of these HUS cases are children under five years old , although the feeble elderly may also be at risk . <p> Illness caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes may be either mild or severe . Milder cases are characterized by a sudden onset of fever , severe headache , vomiting , and other influenza-type symptoms . Severe cases can result in chronic illness and death . Listeriosis may appear mild in healthy adults and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunocompromised . Outbreak data show that the incubation period ranges from three to 70 days . <p> Illness from the bacterium Salmonella usually appears six to 74 hours after eating contaminated food and lasts for a day or two . Common symptoms are nausea , diarrhea , stomach pain , and sometimes vomiting . In rare cases Salmonella , like many other bacterial and parasitic infections , can cause chronic disease syndromes such as arthritis and meningitis . Although the illness is generally regarded as a relatively mild disease , death can occur in some cases  --  especially for the very young , very old , or immunocompromised . <p> Staphylococcus aureus intoxications occur usually within one to six hours following consumption of the toxin produced by the bacteria . In fact , onset of symptoms may occur within 30 minutes of consumption . Illness caused by S. aureus enterotoxin is characterized by severe nausea , vomiting , cramps , and diarrhea . Although the illness generally does not last longer than one or two days , the severity of the illness may indicate the need for hospitalization and possibly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cause acute or chronic human illness when people eat undercooked pork , mutton , and some other meats . The acute illness has mild flu-like symptoms . People can also be exposed to T. gondii through contact with cats or cat excrement . Most people infected with the parasite do not have any symptoms , and some people are at higher risk of getting sick from this parasite . Women infected with T. gondii during pregnancy may transmit the infection to their fetus , possibly leading to still births or babies born with birth defects ranging from hearing or visual impairments to mental retardation . People with suppressed immune systems , such as AIDS and cancer patients , are also at higher risk than others from this parasite . One outbreak associated with undercooked meat indicates that the incubation period ranges from 10 to 23 days .  --  Food Review , U.S. Department of Agriculture <p> <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By Beatrice Trum Hunter <p> <p> Mrs. Hunter is CR 's food editor . <p>                 @ @ @ @
