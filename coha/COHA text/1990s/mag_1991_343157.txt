On Feb. 27 , six months and 25 days after Iraqi tanks crushed Kuwait beneath their treads , another column of armored vehicles rumbled into the capital city . This time the advancing forces were greeted with an outburst of exultation that rivaled the liberation of Paris during World War II . As columns of Kuwaiti and Saudi tanks and personnel carriers rolled up the battered , wreckage-strewn expressway into Kuwait City , civilian cars formed a convoy around them , horns honking , flags waving . Crowds along the way danced and chanted , " Allah akbar ! " " U.S.A. ! U.S.A. ! " and " Thank you , thank you ! " Thousands swarmed onto the streets , embracing and kissing the arriving soldiers . <P> That joyful scene was staged amid the ruins of what had been a gleaming metropolis . It was backlighted by towering orange flames on the horizon where hundreds of oil wells , torched by fleeing Iraqis , continued to burn and block the midday sun with huge curtains of dense black smoke . The eerie pall was a visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iraqi occupation and a final , horrifying week of murder , kidnapping and destruction . <P> Yet even the terrible memories could not still the celebration as the troops moved into the center of the city , where parking lots were carpeted with broken glass and scores of buildings that had been set on fire by Iraqi troops still smoldered . Members of the Kuwaiti resistance movement joined in the parade , shooting into the air with rifles from the back of pickup trucks . Saudi soldiers added to the din with bursts of machine-gun fire . <P> Everywhere the **25;10480;TOOLONG Kuwaiti flag , which had been outlawed during the occupation , fluttered from buildings , bridges and hats . A baby dressed in an outfit made from the flag was held up to be kissed by the liberators . A woman in black robes blew kisses at U.S. Marine Lieut . General Walt Boomer , who rode atop one of the troop carriers . " We 'll never see anything like this again in our lifetime , " Boomer declared . " Makes you appreciate freedom , does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions of revenge and hatred . Newly liberated Kuwaitis began a campaign to eradicate every reminder of the occupation . They shredded , burned and even machine-gunned portraits of Saddam Hussein and Iraqi flags . A band of youths used a sledgehammer to demolish a sign marking the REPUBLIC OF IRAQ MINISTRY OF EDUCATION IN THE DISTRICT OF KUWAIT . Others spat on Iraqi bank notes , the only legal tender under Saddam 's rule , and tossed them into a bonfire . <P> The angry mood was shared by many of the arriving soldiers and civilians . One of them , Mohammed Khayhe , a Saudi Information Ministry official , surveyed the cold , smoky darkness over the city . The electricity had gone off when the allied ground offensive began on Feb. 24 , and cars were using their headlights in the choking billows from the oil fires . " It 's like a nuclear winter , " said Khayhe . " Now that Kuwait is free , it 's not fit to live in. "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
