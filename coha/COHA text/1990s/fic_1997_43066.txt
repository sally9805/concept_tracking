HYPOCRISY <p> The hypocrite lacks the language of excusable hypocrisy , thus gets caught and named . He does n't know how to finesse his discrepancies , his great gap between statements and deeds . And sometimes he 's just hopeless , the problem so rooted in character he can not be redeemed . We 're worse than he , having learned the grease of manners , the smoke screens of style . When confronted with inconsistencies , we say we contain multitudes . Or admit to just enough sleaziness so we 'll be thought of as complicitous , attractively perverse . Eventually , over a lifetime , we 're found out , if not by others then harshly by ourselves . Yet hypocrisy is a social virtue . A day without it is likely to be a cruel day indeed . In public we say " How cute " about the ugly baby , yet ca n't help but note its ugliness when we get home . Privately we 've laughed a few times at racial jokes , yet deplore racial jokes . Can we imagine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? All that brutality trying to pass as honesty . Please say it behind my back . <p> PRECISION <p> On a gravestone : For Andrew 1912-1935 who died saving his drowning brother . Under that : The White Flower of a Blameless Life . And I remembered years ago hesitating on the shore as the tide took a screaming man out into the Northumberland Strait . A poor swimmer , I saved his life by summoning a fisherman who was docking a boat . Hero ? Coward ? Neither word seemed to fit . If he had drowned and I had drowned one certainly can imagine different words , words with modifiers , for me . Cowardice has more to do with what we can do , and do n't . Which makes most of us cowards , I suppose . It 's a cousin to ambivalence , and why thinkers-we hesitators-are suspect in all popular art . Andrew may have been a hero . But The White Flower of a Blameless Life ? Please . Let 's hope his loved ones simply were overwhelmed by grief . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing a difficult tune . The self with its dislocations , its absences , careening toward the extreme . Hungry for the approval of a few . Still , work is its own testimony . What we 've tried for , how close we 've come , all there on the page . Especially what we have n't tried for-that failure of ambition . The bad adjectives-blind , naked , unbridled-waiting for the desperate self looking to enlist others in its cause . But who among us does n't want a prize and a place at the table ? If only our best words became the words many were inclined to use . Sentimental to think so . We live in this world , and our job is to say what that feels like and is . <p> HUMILITY <p> Important to understand our true size in the universe . Thus if we spit in its indifferent , meaningless eye , we know to spit high and with all our might . Small fits only some of us well . The humble size-down to slip in , never break a seam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . Is n't humility best a sometimes thing ? Stunned by someone else 's grace or better mind , we pause ; we learn and praise . Stunned by nature 's ferocity , we go inside a while . But we come out ! We make a few more claims about what we 've seen and thought . Sure , arrogance is always nearby . Foolish to embrace it , or entirely to turn away . In fact we were sure we needed a little of its brashness , its disregard for popularity , if we were to have anything to say . <p> DESPAIR <p> How to stare meaninglessness in its large , milky eye , and continue on ? It 's our tragic condition ; if only he could accept it he might have a new kind of freedom . But all he can think of is a tautology : this meaninglessness is meaningless . He 's no longer excited that the world is full of ice cream cones to be licked , fast cars to drive with women of various speeds , and words , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The oppressiveness of vitality ! The man who despairs will have none of it . For him , hope is even more abstract than God , and the little cocoon he 's built around himself offers a curious satisfaction . A firing squad is not coming in the morning . He just feels as if it is . His doctor is all pill and euphemism . Knock , knock . The Jehovah 's Witnesses are at the door , three of them , cheerful beyond decency . They 'd like to explain a few things . <p> ILLNESS <p> A man learns he has an incurable illness , and for months will not or can not speak its language . When he 's not staring at the walls of his house , he 's silent among friends . Then he gets on a plane and hums through the sky , eats his way through Paris , and hoo-hahs into Luxembourg with a tormented Belgian heiress he 's met on a train . She instructs him , simply by being herself , about what it is he does n't want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a man who has an incurable illness , and returns to his wife , though she 's been doing some hoo-hahing of her own and kisses him wrongly and for too long . It 's a moment of perfect understanding , better than forgiveness , and each turns the other loose so that they might choose each other again . Meanwhile , in his absence , a wheelchair ramp has been built , he senses Debilitation planning a little party , the caterer at this very moment ( he imagines ) is wrapping prosciutto around fruit that feels nothing when the toothpick is inserted . He 's reconciled to nothing . He calls it dancing , this soft-shoe he does , this dragging . That worsening tremor-that 's the new way he 's come to lead the band . It looks like passion . <p> CYNICISM <p> Originally , for the Greek Cynics , an issue of virtue and self-control . Virtue was the only good ; self-control , the only means for attaining it . Easy to see that the word was off to a bad start . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an overriding suspicion of self-interest . The cynic , therefore , has the luxury of being mostly correct . Wilde had his number perfectly : " Someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing . " What do we value ? What do we love ? A skeptic is no one 's favorite lover , but I ca n't help think as a skeptic might . I love what 's left after love has been tested . I value the doubt that gets the scientist to the solution . When a skeptic meets a cynic on the street : " Nice day , so far , " the skeptic says . The cynic has to think about that . <p> EGO <p> The egoless : hard to trust they know what should be cherished and kept . The egotistical : they like too much-regardless of content-what is theirs . I admire Whitman 's ego , capacious but not big . Should n't ego be cultivated until it 's at least personality ? Maybe then , as some have counseled , we could give it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Whitman 's the model ; something of him and what he accumulated and made . For us . There 'll always be gibes from those who equate ego with a rampant , vainglorious I. There 'll always be the cynics who made less of more . Let them have less . I say all this knowing many of us have selves divided . Fragments everywhere . At best a little cutting , a little paste . <p> SUICIDES <p> It 's usually a flirtation with Plath or Sexton or Berryman , but of my many students who 've written about suicide , two have actually done it . After the second , years ago , I decided never to try to improve such a poem . We discuss it privately . I say , Do n't do it . I say , Make an appointment with a counselor . Meanwhile , for myself , I 've thought : How sensible . When my body becomes someone else 's chore , when the mind fogs and the days lengthen and I 'm unable to transform suffering into one of the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't there a curious elegance in how one moment passes into another ? And wo n't it be easy to assume I 'm dead already ? But say a brilliant nurse , sensing my mood , shows me the tattoo on her breast . And a wise friend reminds me that the right solution is rarely the only one . I can imagine the lovely tactics of those who care . Rehearsals , postponements . <p> ELEGIES <p> Public or private ? If the latter , say whatever you want in whatever way . Otherwise , remember that sadness does not preclude language 's vivacities and charms . This does n't mean you ca n't be simple and true . It 's just unlikely . He was your father , after all , and did what it took to die . And nothing about it was simple , and much of the truth died with him . <p> Still , after all these years , you 're of many feelings . The question is which of them you 'll choose to regulate the others . How you tell it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be able to count on History to help in any way . None of the instruments agrees that it was a dark , sad day , that day in 1969 . Except for you . And you must remember you 're speaking to strangers . No one , as of yet , cares . Or should . <p> STRANGERS <p> The door opened . " I 've come all the way from Telluride , " the man said , holding something behind his back . He was middle-aged , conventionally dressed . " I 've come all the way from Telluride because I heard you were doing poetry here . " Here was Utah , a summer workshop , several of us seated around a seminar table . I was at its head . The man had n't moved from the door . More quietly now , almost in a whisper , he again said where he 'd come from , and asked if we could look at his poems . " Sorry , " I said , " but we 're in the middle of a class . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still behind his back . " I 'm very sorry to have bothered you , " he said , " but I 've come a long way . " As he turned to leave , we could see several sheets of paper , presumably poems . When he was gone , a woman in class asked how I could have said that to him , she was sure he had a gun . The rest of the class , agitated , all talking at once , agreed . But I had never thought of a gun . I was sure he was concealing poems and , like many of the participants , had come from some distance for reasons literary and therefore personal to see how he might fare in this world . <p> ACQUAINTANCES <p> Not friends . A friend , after all , is someone with whom you need not discuss important subjects , though often you do . Nor do you have to clarify the status of your relationship , except when you must . Your good news does n't bother him too much . Bad news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of you knows what small misfortunes to keep to yourself . To be just an acquaintance is normal enough . But terrible to be an acquaintance when you want to be a friend . Terrible when one person is thinking friend , the other acquaintance , and , after a long separation , those rapid , uncomfortable pats on the back when they hug . Show me a back-patter , and I 'll show you an acquaintance lost among his intuitions , whose body 's Morse code is doubt , doubt , doubt . At a party <p> full of acquaintances , it 's almost as bad . What do we say after we 've said what we usually say ? Better to be a stranger with small hopes and a plan . <p> VULGAR <p> Not always bad taste , but the exercise of taste without knowing the level above it . Ostentation , sometimes as small as a wink . The gum chewer , of course , and the man with a wad of bills . But the patronizer , too , the person who puts his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dolls . Those who think sarcasm is wit . Gossipers who chirp rather than confide with the proper malice and delight . Gold chains . In fact , any jewelry that suggests a personality disorder . Sometimes , though , the vulgar is not vulgar . Fuck , pussy , cock , for example , when used lovingly . The beer with the ballgame . The rude , wounded shout in the corporate calm . <p> SUBLIME <p> Las Vegas . Shut in for a weekend with slots , roulette , blackjack , craps . A little of one , a lot of the other . Women with outfits cut for whatever you might be thinking , though you 're not much thinking of them . Keno during mealtime . Big tip for the keno girl when you win . Dealers with blank faces . Ladies with blue hair , and their polyester men . A couple of thousand to lose . Family politics says OK . Says once a year all right to flirt with just enough destruction to make the armpits sweat , the mind delude itself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on black on a whim . Another scotch . Bells going off , people being ruined . Two days . I love vulgarity for two days . On the morning of the third a craving for something namelessly clean . Silence . A snowy silence . No , not that clean . <p> ANONYMITY <p> Of poets , there 's Anonymous , more famous than many who sign their names . Even the most famous American poet could walk down Fifth Avenue in sunlight and not be known . Few poets , therefore , or bus drivers or clerks , for that matter , seek anonymity . Why seek what is already yours ? Anonymity suggests a chosen state , a series of remote , discrete , not necessarily unhappy days . It presumes you 've done something noteworthy , that the voyeuristic public wants to breathe your air . Or you 're a squealer , a rat , the government loves you , and your old bad friends are looking for a man you ca n't afford to be . Fame is death to you . To the unrecognized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and actually might be if they can keep from needing it . Better if it comes when you 're older , friends already in place , character lines etched around your mouth and eyes . And there you are , almost safe , committed to the habits that have limited you for years . <p> INDIFFERENCE <p> There 's evidence of life in hatefulness , which is why indifference , not hate , is the opposite of love . Between lovers , what 's worse than a shrug ? Or you look in the mirror , and not even an old friend stares back , or anybody you 'd be inclined to improve . Otherwise , indifferent may be how you properly feel about anyone unengaging . It can be as natural as a yawn , not necessarily a failing or a falling away . Justified or not , indifference is never anything to be proud of ; there 's not a situation it has ever made better . For those regulars of indifference , to whom so little matters , some synapse between brain and world has snapped , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt , these masters of distance , which also means beyond joy . <p> NATIVES <p> A friend-who makes it not his business but his passion to know the names of things-once walked me through my property , naming everything that grew . I was grateful . All my life I 'd been someone who called a maple a tree , a marigold a flower . I owned four acres in the woods ; the walk took part of an afternoon . Neruda said , " Love is so short , forgetting so long , " so my learning must not have been love . As I remember , I forgot most of those names before I got back to the house . But it was a loving thing that he did , as I 've come to understand love . Part giving , part showing off-an exuberance reserved only for a few . Rhododendron , goat's-rue , white pine . He must have pointed these out . I chant them now like someone who will always love song more than fact . <p> LOVERS <p> They come to the strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to learn . Because they 're in love , however , cars stop for them when they step into danger . Waiters bring them appetizers in seven different languages . They sample without utensils , then suck each other 's fingers clean . The waiters rush home to make love to their wives . It is April . The lovers buy identical dark-blue berets and stroll by the river , where at dusk even people who dislike each other walk arm in arm . Among them , they feel disguised , though it 's obvious that they come from a country that exists for only moments at a time . The chambermaid in their hotel has been dreaming them back , has left mints and extra towels . Their shower has no lip , and as they shower together the entire bathroom becomes a pool . Children from the barrios arrive to play in it . Everyone is suddenly naked , and only in the most heartless ministries of decorum are international relations strained . <p> DEFEATS <p> Those failures of nerve , not of skill , are the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the argument . Double defeats , really ; we end up on the sorry side of the score and our character 's in question . Better to be overwhelmed and have no excuses . Even when a series of defeats sends us to the bottom of ourselves , at least there 's a chance we 'll locate some bedrock of dignity , a place below which can be converted into victory . Or a reason to endure . There are good defeats . Yet some old , unexamined undercurrent , some tendency , often will return us to the scenes of defeat . We 'll dial that unhappy number we 've dialed before . We 'll bring up that subject that always results in shouts and tears . With luck , we 'll catch ourselves , find a game we can sometimes win with someone who wo n't easily lose . <p> ACCEPTANCE <p> Certainly not of things as they are . Certainly not of a cosmology that posits we 're insignificant , though of course we are . And are n't some of us less insignificant than others ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few triumphs . And then the expansion of what personal means : another person 's tragedy , a country 's collapse . The larger the personal becomes , the greater our helplessness . Better to be furious at one thing , become radiant with purpose . Better to love links and rhythms than all-embracing answers . I accept the croissants at breakfast and the side dish of plums . I accept that we are designed to die , and that hell is a more persuasive afterlife than heaven , though I accept neither . My friends flirt with the spiritual seductions of the East . But why would someone want to get in harmony with this universe ? So much bad company . What 's wrong with wanting to be elsewhere ? <p> LANDSCAPES <p> Never , for me , just mountains or clearings , or presently even these reedy marshes with egrets and herons amid the billboards . I need to put people in . Maybe I do n't trust my eye , or the fact that there 's an invisible person in every landscape , an inevitable imposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arboretum near the cove . I want the sound of a human voice to disturb the lily pond , perhaps someone explaining himself . No doubt also impositions of mind , though conscious , willful . Once , in Minnesota , a newcomer , I was startled by the darkness of the soil as I drove from Worthington to Marshall . Cornfields recently plowed . I did n't quite know what I was seeing . " What 's that ? " I asked my companion . " That 's dirt , " he said . If only I 'd been able to keep my mouth shut , trusting that I 'd come back later to see it for what it was , then make it more identifiably mine . Maybe add a farmer . Have him walking in his dirt , up to his ankles , without worry or particular pride . <p> INTERIORS <p> In New Orleans , a bed-and-breakfast in a seamy part of town . Dentist 's chair the seat of honor in the living room . Dark , the drapes closed , a lamp 's three-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we belong . All the guests believing in the unsaid . Muffled hilarity coming from the other rooms . Paintings everywhere , on the walls , the floor . Painted by the proprietress , who , on the side , reads the tarot . In her long black gown she does n't mind telling me things look rather dismal . Something about the Queen of Swords and the Hanged Man . I wake early the next morning for a flight . 5:00 A.Mr . She 's sitting in the dentist 's chair , reading a book about the end of the century . Says a man like me needs a proper breakfast . Wants to know everything I dreamed . <p> READING <p> From his hotel balcony in Italy he sees a lovely woman sunning herself on the balcony adjacent to his . Only a little wall and a few large plants separate them . She 's topless , but after a while that does n't matter . She 's reading a book he 's written , and he can see her lips moving to some of his words . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he almost gasps . Never has silence served him so well . The woman , he concludes , knows that he 's watching her . Too much of a coincidence otherwise . But the fact is-he 'll learn this later-she does n't know . She adjusts the lounge chair and turns to lie on her stomach . Her breasts press into the obliging cushion . The book is open , and she 's propped herself on her elbows , smiling at something he 's written . " What is pleasing you ? " he 's tempted to ask , but chooses instead to imagine it 's the scene in which the protagonist feels she 's a prisoner of her own taste . He retreats to his room , packs , unpacks , then writes a note , which he carries to the concierge . " For the woman in Room 408 , " it says , and he begins to worry about the disappointments of the actual . <p> ERASURE <p> I 've crossed things out with a thin , single stroke so the original can be read , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentionally erased two people from my life , only two , yet ca n't help following the traces of them . Like pentimento , some old marks , some ruins , ghosting my days and nights . Any fictionist knows that one event , even if poorly executed , can make another happen , the slightest authenticity creating a path to the hidden . One way to revise : erase something , erase something else , see what 's left standing , then decide if it deserves companions . Total erasure makes sense too , a grand cleaning up after the misconceived party , a starting over with a better nothing . The eros of beginnings ! Yet even then , who does n't desire to leave a trail , almost followable , or dream of being properly found by someone who might care that much to look so hard ? <p> MONEY <p> Like a religion but without a theology , or a place to rest . And as many or more bad things done in its name . Many ministers of spin in its higher realms . Many priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form of exchange , eliminating the three cows for their equivalent in grain . At its best : a conduit to food and shelter and the little extra that translates into choice . Never to be loved , though , unless we wish only things in return . No correlation between savings and saved . But money is power , and a kind of truth . We must therefore distrust the truth , we lovers of truth . Make our own . Once we thought our pockets should be empty , which made us poor and righteous , not distrustful enough of truths that wished to unite labor and need . We did n't know enough about biology , or comfort 's lure . Yet we were so naive our errors had a beauty to them and bought us a few priceless years . <p> INDULGENCE <p> Because , as Blake says , you have to know what 's more than enough in order to know what 's enough , we have a rationale if we need one . Or , if more is required , " The road of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a pleasing economy that persuades . Let 's run away to Bimini , wipe the bank account clean . But if there is a palace of wisdom , on its door it 's sure to have : There are many ways . Next to excess , there must be : Pare down , become lean . Who 's to say that the monk is n't indulging himself with glorious severities ? Oh , we know the penalties for serious indulgence : unrelieved pleasure for the hedonist , clarity 's pain for the ascetic . But for most of us indulgence falls short of a calling . We neither get wise from it nor become especially ruined . A night on the town , halfway up the road . <p> SUPERSTITION <p> The crack in the sidewalk , and a broken back . The ladder under which a black cat must not stroll . Knock on wood . There are things we must ward off or forestall . Superstition is the irrationality we bring to the irrational world . It 's a way of pressing back . Because science only takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because even if we know why it rains we do n't know if it will . The athlete crosses himself before a free throw . The shot goes in , and the Trinity made it happen . It misses : a mere failure of concentration . But sympathetic magic succeeds more often than it does n't . We sweep popcorn off of the veranda to keep the elephants away . The elephants do n't comel To keep the one you want you dig up her footprint and put it in a flowerpot . She stays with you for months ! This is how pagans pray . It 's heaven when it works . <p> CERTAINTY <p> Taxes have loopholes , but not even Heisenberg could make death uncertain . Certainty is what we feel when we know a little less than enough . <p> It 's only about uninteresting things that we can be wholly certain . This is a refrigerator , for example . Or that 's a plum . If some philosophers want to worry about these designations , I 'm quite certain a plum is a plum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd know it was the same tasty thing . About matters of the heart , only negative capability will do . About real time and imaginary time , let the dreamer meet the physicist for a friendly duel . The world of intellect : inseparable from the world of feeling . That 's a certainty . It 's how it feels . <p>
