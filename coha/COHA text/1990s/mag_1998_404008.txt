Kendrith Bentley remembers the day she discovered wildflowers . She and her seven-year-old daughter , Kaley , were trekking 11 km up a Rocky Mountain trail en route to Skokie Lodge in Banff National Park . Bentley had travelled that route , and others in the area , many times but the long haul was a first for her little girl . To help Kaley pass the time , Bentley bought a guide to wildflowers and , together , they made a game of identifying the blossoms along their path . Not only did the diversion get Kaley hooked on hiking , it taught Bentley the charms of pursuing her lifelong passion at a child 's pace . " I do n't think there were wildflowers before that day , " she says . " I 'd never seen them . I was just zooming up the mountain . " Slowing down is one of the first principles of getting physical with your family , but it 's a tough one to practise when life with kids reaches a hectic pace . Still , there 's ample reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and their parents  --  strength , suppleness and stamina , reduces the risk of heart disease , diabetes and obesity , and is essential to the development of muscles and bone mass . What 's more , it helps kids sleep better , increases their self-confidence , and decreases aggression , anxiety and depression . It may even help them with their studies , as their level of concentration and creativity increases following a workout . Yet according to the Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute , our kids are a sedentary bunch  --  40 percent less active than our generation was as youngsters . The average child spends 25 to 30 hours per week sitting at school and another 26 watching TV . No wonder only one-third of them meet the institute 's physical activity standards for peak health and more than a quarter fall short of the minimum suggested activity level ( the equivalent of a half-hour of biking every day , for example ) . That 's reason enough to jump up and get them moving . But moms and dads who make physical fitness a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves join in the fun . " The fitness aspect is important to feeling good about yourself , " explains Ancaster , Ontario mother Brenda Nelson . " But for me , being active with our kids is important because my husband and I both work full-time . It gives us something that pulls our family together . " But where and when to begin ? Even parents who are adept at a sport have experienced the frustration of nurturing a neophyte athlete . The rewards , however , do come , says Edmonton dad and avid cyclist Dave Whirten . Like many parents , he logged hours teaching his kids to balance on their bikes . Today , at ages ten and 15 , pedalling is no problem . In fact , last summer the family spent three weeks mountain biking some 1,500 km ( 990 miles ) along France 's back roads . Whirten admits his family 's adventure is exceptional . In the end , he says , the real trip is " enjoying the activity through your kids ' happy experience , watching them have fun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitness rewarding , here are ten tips for getting started . Keep it simple Introducing fitness into family life does n't require running marathons . Shoot some hoops , walk to school , toss a ball , rake the leaves or build a snowman . The key is to make the time to play with your kids and , says Don Hinchey of Langley , B.C. , to be patient . It takes his family 15 minutes to get ready for a half-hour of in-line hockey in front of the house . " Sometimes the kids are ready to stop right after you get the gear on , " he says . " You just have to say , " We 're going to do this , " and go to it . " Often the simplest activities foster a lifetime appreciation of a sport . Lee Dobson 's dad got her hooked on tennis on the community courts in the Vancouver neighbourhood where she grew up . Then she turned her four daughters on to the sport by spending afternoons with them whacking a shuttlecock over a backyard badminton net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Dobson . " Our were completely unstructured . The goal was to have fun . " Set the right pace Jack Goodman , a professor of physical education at the University of Toronto , took his two children out on cross-country skis for the first time last year . " My five-year-old daughter , who is pretty much useless on them , had a ball , " he says . " She loves playing in the snow , so it did n't matter if she only lasted five minutes . The exposure was good . I want to gently cultivate that . " Cathie Mills uses the same philosophy when she plans hikes for toddlers ( including her three-year-old son , Thomas ) whose parents belong to the Iroquois branch of the Bruce Trail Association . She rarely takes the kids out on the trail near her Hamilton , Ontario home for more than an hour at a time . " Start small , making sure the first hike is n't too difficult . Let them dawdle , then nudge the pace up slowly , " she suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who teaches children aged four to eight , suggests " shrinking " some elements of the game to help reduce frustration : Try using only half the court ; string up a rope " net " to about the height of your child 's waist ; and reduce tennis ball bounce by deflating the ball slightly ( or check sports shops for balls designed with kids in mind ) . Brenda Nelson wedged her three-year-old between her thighs until the youngster was big enough to handle a ski rope tow on her own , then used a hoolahoop to assist her when coming down the beginner slopes . It took some perseverance , but within a couple of seasons , the family was enjoying the excitement and challenge of intermediate runs together . Take it from a pro Thinking back on those early years on the slopes , Nelson says with a laugh , " I think it 's better for everyone if somebody else teaches kids the fundamentals . " She likes the idea of a half-day of structured time , leaving the afternoon open for family time . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat Seltsam teaches in-line skating in Calgary . He thinks even experienced ice skaters can benefit from one or two in-line lessons . " The basic technique of being able to skate forward on in-lines is the same as it is on ice skates , " he says . " But stopping techniques generally are different , and the terrain is vastly different . " Because Seltsam 's lessons emphasize safety , parents who join their children for an initial hour or two of expert help will be able to call on that advice as the kids test their own limits . Invest wisely Investing in the right equipment may mean the difference between a day of fun and a day of frustration . Seltsam recommends parents shop at sports , rather than toy , stores for in-line skates . " Kids wo n't enjoy the activity as much on cheap skates , " he says . " The wheels do n't roll or grip the road as well as those on more expensive models . " Brenda Nelson suggests parents rent skis until they 're sure the sport is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pick up from the rental pros to shop more astutely at second-hand outlets or ski swaps . If you want to buy new stuff , check out stores with trade-in options for growing kids . Equipment is expensive , she says , but you have to put the price in perspective . A $400 snowboard , for example , will provide several seasons of fun . Hiking leader Mills says a good-quality running shoe with arch support will serve most young hikers if they stick to flat terrain . But if you plan to do a lot of trekking , she recommends boots : " They give better ankle support and traction on rougher trails , as well as warmth and water resistance . Stay safe Helmets , wrist guards and knee and elbow pads " are an absolute must , " says in-line skater Don Hinchey . " My kids " stuff is just hacked up from their tumbles . " It 's important that parents set the right example and wear safety gear too . Mills says the only watchword for hikes with toddlers is to stick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kendrith Bentley recommends trekking with a couple of adults . You want to know that someone can get help , she explains , should anyone get hurt . Stop , look and drink The key to timely breaks , says Mills , is to make sure you stop before your kids indicate they 're tired . " Otherwise , " she warns , " they 're not going to want to get going again . " Plenty of water is a must no matter what the season , she adds , " because kids get dehydrated quicker than adults . " And take along lots of high-carbohydrate snacks ( raisins and other dried fruits , bagels or energy bars are good choices ) . They 'll be useful as both energy boosters and encouragement . Mix and mingle If you 're trying a new sport for the first time , it helps to join a group or association . Mills says parents can learn a lot about what children are capable of and pick up equipment tips as well by taking their first few hikes with a group . Or opt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a network of kids who come along , " says cyclist Whitten . " Kids seem to encourage each other , especially if there is an older one they admire and want to keep up with . " Follow the leader It 's likely that you 'll steer your kids into activities that you enjoy . But Janice Veenstra , of Barrie , Ontario , discovered the advantages of following her two boys , ages seven and ten , to the ski hill . " I 'd tried skiing when I was 16 , " she explains , " but I had a fall and never went out again . " But when her boys began spending all their free time on the slopes , she decided to take up the sport again . " I thought , I 'm going to lose them , or I can join them . " Play it up Inevitably you 're going to need a few tricks up your sleeve to revitalize a discouraged child . Veenstra makes sure to acknowledge her elder sons talent on the slopes . " He does n't concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he can spend a whole day going up and down those hills . It 's good for his self-esteem , and children need that . " And remember to have a laugh together when you fall down or miss the ball  --  that 's part of the fun . Resources Moving and Growing , Fitness Canada and the Canadian Institute of Child Health .
