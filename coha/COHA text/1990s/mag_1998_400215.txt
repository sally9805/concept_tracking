Stock these 25 essentials for grab-it-and-go meals . // Want to join us for a trip to the mountains ? We 're leaving tomorrow after work , " the voice at the other end of the phone says . No doubt they want me along for my sterling company . I look at the clock-7 2 . M. , just enough time to organize my gear before hitting the hay . " Oh , one other thing . Sally ca n't go , and she 'd volunteered to bring the food . Can you handle it ? " I swallow hard . The truth is they onlv want me for my grub . " Sure , I answer with confidence . " No problem . " And it 's not , because my cupboard is stocked with the 25 backcountry essentials . At a moment 's notice I can scramble together meals for a weekend on the trail , all lightweight good-tasting , and anything but monotonous . No need to burriedly inventory what 's on hand , franticaly dash to the supermarket to fill in the holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bagging ingredients . Why just 25 ingredients , especially when there 's a universe full o foods suitable for backpacking ? Because through years of practice . I 've noticed that many of the same ingredients keep showing up in most of my backcountry creations . By narrowing the list and designing recipes around these aS ingredients , I 've simplified my life without sacrificing taste or variety . You 'll find most of these backcountry essentials at your favorite supermarket and local health food store . although some specialty items can he hard to track down . I 've offered suggestions on where you can get these through mail-order ( see " Resources , " page 3 " ) . If you re the overly fastidious sort . you might consider keeping an inventory list that shows when you 're running low on any one item When you 're scraping the bottom of the barrel , you add the items to your household shopping list and scratch them off as you make your usual rounds . . Or you place an order with a specialty food company through the mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A note about storage . I keep backcountry-only ingredients in a large pretzel tin and stow it in a cool , dry area . If you have shelf space to spare , then reserve room for your camping food supplies . I also store powdered eggs , powdered dairy products , dried or freeze-dried meats or seafood , and anything with a high fat content in a bag in the refrigerator or freezer . Photograph // 1 . QUICK OATS . Make your own nocook oatmeal by running 1-minute ( a.k.a. quick " ) oats briefly through a food processor . You want them to be the consistency of the instant oats you find in store-bought packets of instant oatmeal . Team them up with powdered milk , fruit . and brown sugar or other sweetener . On the trail , pour the oatmeal mix ( 3/4 cup feeds one hungry hiker ) into a mug , add boiling water , stir , and let stand . 2 . POWDERED MILK . No breakfast cereal is complete without it . Powdered milk supplies calcium , protein , and flavor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't lump , and it stores for a long time . 3 . COFFEE , TEA , AND HOT CHOCOLATE . Would you be able to start or finish the day without them ? 4 . QUICK-COOKING HASH BROWNS . At the grocery store , look for hash browns that rehydrate with boiling water . If the store does n't stock them , you might buy a package of instant latkes and use the dried potatoes . Hash browns are the foundation of a sticksto-your ribs breakfast . 5 . DRIED FRUIT . Branch out from plain old raisins and prunes to exotic mango , papaya , pineapple , cranberries , and other dried fruit . They taste great in cereals , curries , and desserts . Dried cherries with chocolate pudding is a favorite of mine . 6 . POWDERED EGGS . For breakfast on the first day , go ahead and use EggBeaters or a similar egg white product . After that you 'll want powdered eggs , which can be doctored quite nicely . Some outdoors stores stock powdered eggs , as do mail order companies AlpineAire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on page 37 ) . 7 . BAGELS AND TORTILLAS . Keep a supply of these ready to go in the freezer , or pick up fresh ones on the way out of town . Bagels and tortillas are the backbone of any trail lunch and a good source of complex carbohydrates , which replenish your store of glycogen. 8 . QUICK-COOKING GRAINS . For fast dinners you 'll want a supply of instant rice , couscous , and small-grained bulgur to choose from . Freeze-dried wild rice is available through AlpineAire. 9 . CHINESE OR INSTANT RAMEN NOODLES . These are precooked and dried , so they 're ready in a flash , which saves stove fuel . They are good with vegetables and soup mixes . Many supermarkets stock these in the international foods aisle . 10 . PASTA . Small shells and elbows are easier to drain and eat than are long strands of spaghetti . No-cook pasta is available through AlpineAire. 11 . INSTANT MASKED POTATOES . Allows you to make shepherd 's pie , potato pancakes , and a quick , hot lunch on soggy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real boon for Mexican meals . Just add boiling water and-Presto ! - you have seasoned refries for burritos . Look in the international foods or instant soup section of your supermarket . Black bean powder can be substituted if they 're not available . 13 . LENTILS . Place in a screw-top bottle with water at the start of the day , and come dinner time the lentils will cook up in about 5 minutes ( S cup dried lentils + 1 cup water = 1 cup of ready-to-eat lentils ) . Use in stews , burritos , curries , and other dishes . 14 . DRIED VEGETABLES . Carrots , cabbage , bell peppers , mushrooms , onions , and tomatoes enhance dinners and create the impression you 're eating " real food " rather than trail food . Beware of veggie mixes that contain dehydrated peas , com , chunks of carrots , and squares of potatoes , all of which may take more than 30 minutes to rehydrate . Health food stores and supermarkets have some dried veggies . Order carrots , cabbage , bell peppers , mushrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flakes and dried tomatoes , check out The Baker 's Catalogue . Just Tomatoes , Etc. and Backpacker 's Pantry sell several mixtures of freeze-dried and dehydrated vegetables . Photograph Cupboard keepers : ( clockwise from left ) freeze-dried turkey , beef , and chicken , plus hash browns . // 15 . FREEZE.DRIED CORN AND PEAS . So good-tasting , these gems are worth making the effort to order through the mail ( AlpineAire ) . 16 . CANNED TURKEY , CHICKEN , SHRIMP , AND TUNA . Because of their weight , these meats should be used sparingly , but a little goes a long way toward adding heft and flavor to dinners . Freeze-dried meat and seafood is much lighter than canned , and makes a viable alternative on extended trips , but high cost can be a deterrent . Shop for freeze-dried meat and seafood at your local outdoor store or through AlpineAire or Backpacker 's Pantry . 17 . DRIED GROUND BEEF . The only way to stock up on this light , extremely versatile ingredient is to make it yourself . Buy extra-lean ground beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , being careful not to leave any rare meat . Dry the cooked meat in a dehydrator or oven at 130deg to 140degF . If you use an oven , leave the door open an inch or two to circulate the air . Dry two to four hours , or until ground beef is dry and hard to the touch . Store in a plastic bag in the refrigerator or freezer. 18 . NO-COOK SOUPS . Supermarket shelves brim with delectable offerings that require only adding boiling water , but watch out for astronomical sodium levels . These soups are great as an appetizer and help you rehydrate . Combine a quick-cooking grain and extra seasoning for a simple dinner . 19 . NUTS . Peanuts , cashews , almonds , and other nuts add flavor , texture , and lots of calories ( in the form of fat ) to trail meals . Toasting nuts in an oven set at 350F for 10 minutes enriches their flavor . Photograph Essential stock : ( clockwise from left ) black bean powder , powdered eggs , powdered blue cheese , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is loaded with calories , and it gives your taste buds a soothing sensation that carbo-rich foods ca n't come close to . Parmesan keeps well under trail conditions , as does mozzarella . Plastic-wrapped mozzarella " strings " in single-portion servings must have been designed with backpackers in mind . 21 . POWDERED DAIRY PRODUCTS . It 's incredible what you can find in convenient powdered form , like cheddar cheese , blue cheese , butter , and sour cream . Use these as flavor enhancers to make a mundane meal marvelous . Powdered cheddar ( order through AlpineAire or The Baker 's Catalogue ) goes with almost anything . Blue cheese powder ( The Baker 's Catalogue ) makes pasta or a rehydrated vegetable salad special . Butter powder ( The Baker 's Catalogue ) adds smoothness to grits , cereal , and dinners . I recommend pure butter powder over butter-flavored sprinkles like Butter Buds or Molly McButter , which are available in the baking goods section of most supermarkets . Powdered sour cream ( AlpineAire and The Baker 's Catalogue ) makes a mean beef stroganoff. 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian dinners , backwoods smoothies , and desserts for intense flavor and lots of additional calories . You 'll find coconut cream powder in Asian markets . Coconut powder can be ordered through The Baker 's Catalogue . Pure orange powder , also available through The Baker 's Catalogue , weaves a distinct flavor into cereals , smoothies , and desserts. 23 . SINGLE-SERVING CONDIMENTS . Praise the fast-food giants for neatly packaging trail-size portions of catsup , mustard , sweet and sour sauce , mayonnaise , lemon juice , relish , salsa , soy sauce , and honey . Get your supply from leftover fast-food meals or negotiate with the folks behind the counter . 24 . SEASONINGS . Spices , herbs , and herb blends are obvious choices , but I pack along hot sauce , wasabi ( powdered horseradish ) , bouillon , and good old salt and pepper , too . 25 . COMFORT FOOD . Treat yourself to whatever you really love-chocolate , miso , tapioca pudding , salmon jerky , graham crackers . Buy quality products and do n't skimp on portions .
