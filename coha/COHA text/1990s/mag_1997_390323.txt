California Design , the vast triennial exhibition begun in 1954 , captured a golden era. // No other recurrent exhibition documented a golden era in West Coast craft as boldly or ambitiously as did California Design . Begun as an annual showcase of good design for home furnishings at the Pasadena Art Museum in 1954 , the show shifted to high gear in the following decade , becoming a vast triennial survey of the latest and best " implements of living , " until its run ended in 1976 . In recent years the California Contemporary Craft Association has revived California Design as a smaller , though growing , annual event . Still , many Californians fondly remember the original , particularly its 1960s heyday under the direction of Eudorah Moore . A dazzling display of hundreds of handmade and mass-produced objects , from pots and weavings to surfboards and dune buggies , California Design " was very important , because it brought together components that were then not exhibited in a museum setting , " says Bernard Kester , who designed the mammoth installation in those years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moore , a founder and president of the Pasadena Art Alliance , had been a longtime volunteer at the museum when she and a fellow board member , the late Elizabeth Hanson , first took on the task of curating the exhibition in 1962 , with the aim of greatly expanding its size and concept . " We decided that if we were going to have a design show , it had to be a major show . And that if we were going to include crafts , it would have to be in a major and selective way . ' Along with a bold vision , Moore ( who became sole director of the exhibit after ' ' 62 ) had drive , determination , connections , a network of hardworking volunteers , and a strong conviction that California crafts deserved greater public attention . Both time and place were ripe for the kind of large-scale , high-profile event Moore had in mind . " California had an absolutely dazzling moment that has not occurred since . It was so much fun , " she says today of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectuals " enriched this California soil in ways you ca n't imagine . Suddenly , it was no longer parochial . " Simultaneously , " the craft movement was like a most magnificent flower at full bloom . There was an ebullience , " she recalls , stressing the importance of the G.I. Bill , which was responsible for the training of so many craftsmen . " They came to California because it was the dream place . " Moore was captivated . " My awareness of the new craft movement was like a bolt of lightning . I felt then , and still feel , that it was changing the language of art . " " It was an astonishing time , " concurs Susan Peterson , a professor of ceramics at USC from 1955 to 1972 and a longtime California Design participant . " Southern California was a really exciting place , pioneering in all the crafts , " with an abundance of craftspeople engaged in " rampant experimentation " and the sheer " newness of everything . " Most stimulating , says Peterson , was the easy camaraderie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The synergy was right there . It was fantastic , and it has never happened that way again . That 's what the 1950s and 60s were like in California . Everybody talked to each other , and that created excellence and ingenuity . " California Design became the cutting-edge showcase of the scene ; as Peterson herself wrote in Craft Horizons back then , No other museum has an exhibition for this purpose on this scale or with such verve and flair . " From 1962 on , California Design was selected by separate juries for manufactured and handmade objects , and also included some works created , with jury approval , especially for the show . Judging was done not from slides , as is common today , but from thousands of actual entries shipped to depots in Los Angeles and San Francisco . Despite the formidable logistics , assembling the show was always largely a volunteer effort-as Moore puts it , " a true craftsman experience-tremendous sharing , amazing generosity . " Although the county provided some funding , " all we ever got from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bootstrapping to get this thing done . " Kester 's installation would artfully integrate the various works to highlight their relationships , often in the context of a domestic environment . That the mix worked so well was a testament to the " dialogue " Moore believes went on between craft and industry in those days , exemplified by designers like Ray and Charles Eames , who understood and practiced the craftsman ethic . " At that particular moment in California craft , there was this movement back and forth between craftspeople and the industrial world , ' she says . " The intent was different but the process was very much the same-a certain amount of inspiration and technique , and hours of perfecting .

" We had the opportunity to submit our own works . I just ca n't tell you what that meant . My first sale came out of one of those exhibits . It gave such encouragement to students , and to professionals as well . " Seeing the exhibition as a fledgling craftsman , says Bassler , XI just marveled at all the potential . What was so amazing was the scope . These were enormous shows . They went on and on and on . " The scale of the work , too , was occasionally dramatic : " They encouraged us to work big , big , big . You knew that if it turned out well , it stood a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What always amazes me is that my education was so West Coast oriented . The communication between East Coast and West Coast back then was practically nonexistent . So we craftspeople were struggling along , doing our thing . We thought we were the center of the universe . " California Design , says Bassler , gave them self-awareness along with recognition . " It was Eudorah and her group , and her vision , really , that brought craftsmen together to establish some sort of community , and also to get an audience for us . " A key vehicle for building that audience was the lavish hardcover book that accompanied each triennial , beginning in 1962 . XI knew we had to have a catalogue , " Moore recalls . " Here was this ephemeral moment that needed a visible record . We felt if we were dealing with design in this place and time , it had to be a major statement . " Richard Gross , the photographer for four of the books ( Jay Ahrend and Tyler Thorton did the last one ) , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Moore , who would work closely with him over several months to document all the objects in the show . They would scout locations around the state-the desert ( Death Valley was " marvelous for photography because it 's so simple " ) , the beach at Morro Bay above Santa Barbara , the Sequoia mountains , the Great Central Valley farmlands . " Dick loved photographing in natural light , and outdoors . He 'd say , " Oh , those ugly hard shadows . " So we 'd wait all day for the evening light , until it was right for him . " The shots were styled with playful flair-a group of massive clay pots perched in and around an electric compact wagon that was also in the show , for example , or a chair planted in the middle of a freshly plowed field . The overall effect of the settings was oddly striking , often poetic , somehow very California . " It was just the reverse of the neutral-object photography the magazines want today , " says the furniture maker Arthur Espenet Carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I liked it . I thought it was great . " Moore would bring the images home , spread them out on the floor and walk around studying them until the organization of the book " revealed itself " - thus there were chapters on such themes as " Native Color Orange , " " Born of Native Earth , " " Native Needs and Way of Life . " To generate publicity she and Hanson , a former Vogue model who knew her way around the New York magazine world , flew East in 1962 with a suitcase full of photos to make the rounds , a process Moore would repeat for each show . " We would figure out an angle for each magazine . As a result , we were in House Beautiful , House and Garden , Interiors , Industrial Design and many others as well as Craft Horizons . It was the kind of aggressive coverage that shows of that time did n't have . " Photograph Beer can chair by Douglas Deeds Associates , in California Design 8. // California Design mirrored , and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and early 70s-the rise of jewelry , fiber and glass as expressive media , of street furniture and art in architecture , even of recycled materials , as evidenced in a 1962 chair made of beer cans by Douglas Deeds Associates . But as the fields changed , so did the dynamic of the show . After the Pasadena Museum dissolved and became the Norton Simon Museum in 1975 , California Design moved to the brand-new Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles . Though the show was a success , drawing 100,000 visitors in six weeks , Moore herself had begun to question its broad approach . " The dialogue between industrial design and craft had changed , " she reflects . " The languages did n't mesh as well . Increasingly I felt there was less and less amenability . After 1976 , 1 would have done it differently . " In fact , the Bicentennial year turned out to be the last for the exhibition as people knew it . Moore went on to develop other shows and publications on craft in the state , and in 1978 began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Arts . Lois Boardman , who had been education director at the Pasadena Museum , took over as director of California Design , by then a nonprofit organization . Though the group did smaller shows through the early 1980s , it was apparent that without a museum to host it , support for a massive survey was no longer there . Nor , perhaps , did the same need exist . As Boardman puts it , " the world had opened up " ; with the craft boom came greater exhibition opportunities , new shops and galleries , publications , organizations . Suddenly California Design was no longer the only game in town . " It had served a function at a time when it was most needed , " says Boardman , " but times had changed . " California Design endures today , however , in two ways-first , as a developing archive at the Oakland Museum of California , overseen by Marcia Chamberlain , a longtime volunteer for the exhibition , who has created an endowment there to support programs in craft . The archive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's files , will eventually be catalogued and available for study . And the show has a new incarnation , thanks to the California Contemporary Craft Association-a San Francisco Bay Area-based group of professional craftspeople formerly known as the Baulines Craft Guild-which in 1985 got permission to use the name for its annual members ' show . ( al felt if they could do it , more power to them , " says Moore , who is now semi-retired but would take on a project " if it were seductive enough . " ) This second-generation version of California Design has since grown to include nonmembers of CCCA , with the aim of becoming more of a survey in the spirit of its predecessor , if on a more modest scale for the time being . " We knew we would n't be able to produce anything that extensive , but we hope to move further in that direction , " says CCCA executive director Kathleen Hanna . Earlier this year the show celebrated its 10th anniversary , presenting works by some 85 craftspeople within a 9,000-square-foot space designed by Ted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion CCCA did a catalog , its first . With the next California Design scheduled for the year 2000 , the group is gearing up to mark the millennium in as big a way as it can . Says Hanna , " We had such a success this time that we 're even braver now . The interest , desire and energy are there . " To this day , thinks Hanna , California Design " reflects the ups and downs of the movement . The support from the community , on and off ; from funders , on and off . The thread is the continuing devotion of the craftspeople to their work . " She adds , " We 're still working under the same premise as Eudorah'sthat there 's something on this coast that 's favorable for craft . People came here for a reason , to pursue their dreams .
