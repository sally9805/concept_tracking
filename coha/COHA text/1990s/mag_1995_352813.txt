BILL CLINTON 'S PRESIDENCY HAS been an exercise in crisis . His legislative victories have often come only after bloody , near-death struggles , and his numerous political setbacks are nightmarish and ongoing . He has experienced  --  and somehow survived  --  more make-or-break moments in two years than most Presidents do in four . The repudiation in the polls last November was as thorough as any President has ever suffered at mid-term , leading to mordant jokes around Washington that Clinton has become the country 's first half-term President . Though the White House released a 16-page list of accomplishments last week , the public gives him little or no credit for any of it . That baffles Clinton , who often notes privately , If you 'd told me two years ago that I could have accomplished all these things and still be in trouble , I would n't have believed you . ' ' <P> White House officials believed they had a big chance this week to reverse that trend : In his State of the Union speech Tuesday night , Clinton would try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall  --  and increasingly do n't care . Barring a war or economic crisis , aides said , this would probably be Clinton 's last time to give a purely presidential speech to the nation before the campaign season begins . There 's no question that this State of the Union speech is the most important speech of this presidency , ' ' said Leon Panetta , Clinton 's chief of staff last Friday . <P> But as Clinton worked on finishing touches late last week , another crisis loomed . His proposal to provide $40 billion in loan guarantees to the Mexican government ran into an unexpectedly hostile reception on Capitol Hill . His Democratic allies in the House , still smarting from their failure to stop nafta in 1993 , pressed the President for concessions from Mexico City on more favorable labor practices and environmental regulations . House Republicans , though philosophically supportive of the Clinton plan , balked at providing the rest of the votes unless Clinton took a firmer public stand against the demands of the liberal Democrats . Clinton was forced to mount a hurried campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the rebellious Democrats in line . <P> That suited Newt Gingrich and the Republicans just fine : the Mexican crisis was now sure to hang over Clinton 's head Tuesday night . With less than a week to go before the likely vote on the loan guarantees , only 33 of 204 House Democrats agreed to back him . And Latin financial markets were getting the jitters .
