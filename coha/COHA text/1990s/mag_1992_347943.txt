IS LATE REALLY BETTER THAN NEVER ? IN BOSNIA nobody knows , but the thinking in Washington and Western Europe seems to be " Let 's find out . " It is getting very , very late for intervention there . Sarajevo 's 400,000 residents are reaching the end of their food supplies , since relief flights were suspended on Dec. 1 . But few are keen to accept the offer of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to guarantee safe passage to all civilians leaving the city  --  an all too facile and cynical turnabout after eight brutal months of Serb barrage . <P> Nonetheless , NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels worked out contingency plans that ranged from air enforcement of the U.N . ban on Serb military flights over Bosnia to sending troops to create safe havens for potential victims of ethnic cleansing . A senior State Department official believes enforcement of the no-fly zone to be a near certainty , perhaps to be followed by a lifting of the ban on weapons sales to Bosnians . <P> And if it really is too late ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . is considering dispatching 700 peacekeepers to Macedonia . Ethnic tension there , already high , could explode if Slobodan Milosevic is re-elected President of neighboring Serbia on Dec. 20.
