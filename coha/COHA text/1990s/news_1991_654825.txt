<p> ACROSS the spare , dry reaches of southeastern Oregon , a new species is proliferating among the rocks and sand and sagebrush . Specimens stand slim and still as cactuses , and upon closer inspection turn out to be lengths of white PVC pipe driven into the ground to mark mining claims - upward of 400,000 to establish the 65,000 claims that have been filed in recent years . <p> This is all part of the " new gold rush " that has swept the West , the result of three things : gold prices of $300 to $400 an ounce , a method of extraction that allows miners to separate microscopic bits of the precious metal from tons of hitherto worthless ore , and what critics say are lax government regulations . <p> The late 20th-century version of the grizzled codger with the dusty burro and pickax is a multimillion-dollar outfit with huge earth-moving vehicles and truckloads of cyanide pellets . The earth is dynamited , then bulldozed , and scooped into huge mounds . A weak solution of sodium cyanide is sprayed over the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyanide , which drains off into " pregnant ponds , " and it is then carried by pipe to a nearby plant for separation . <p> With production costs of $200 an ounce , this " cyanide heap-leach " mining can be very profitable . ( The price of gold is $367.40 an ounce at this writing . ) As such facilities sprouted up across the West over the past decade - about 160 gold mines now operate on public lands - United States production leapt from 1 million ounces a year to 9.5 million ounces . <p> But the process requires a large-scale operation that tears up the countryside . About 400 tons of earth are moved to obtain the 20 tons of ore necessary to produce a single ounce of gold . A proposal by the Atlas Corporation for Grassy Mountain near Vale , Ore. , would create a pit 2,000 feet in diameter and 800 to 1,000 feet deep . Some 150 million tons of earth would be moved to produce 32 tons of gold - about enough to fill a pickup truck . <p> " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Gary Brown , leader of a grass-roots group called Concerned Citizens for Responsible Mining . Upward of a dozen heap-leach mining proposals are anticipated in the state , described by Mr. Brown as " the last frontier for the industry to conquer . " <p> The environmental record for cyanide mining in other states is far from perfect . Last October , Echo Bay Minerals agreed to pay $500,000 in government fines and donations ( to the Nature Conservancy ) as part of a guilty plea on 25 counts of killing migratory birds at a tailings pond in central Nevada . This is said to be the largest fine ever for violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act . Also in October , about 10 million gallons of cyanide solution flooded a tributary of the Lynches River in South Carolina when an earth dam belonging to the Brewster Gold Mine failed . At least 10,000 fish were estimated to have been killed . <p> In the West , many of the cyanide mines are along the Pacific flyway . Especially in desert areas , thirsty , tired birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies erect nets and fire noise cannons , but these are not foolproof . The cyanide ponds are lined with plastic sheets , but these frequently leak into streams and ground water . <p> When pits are dug , toxic heavy metals are exposed as well . Although records are incomplete , tens of thousands of birds and mammals are known to have died as a result . <p> " These heaps are the toxic waste Superfund cleanup sites of the future , " warns Andy Kerr , conservation director for the Oregon Natural Resources Council . <p> The federal Surface Mining Act requires environmental protection and reclamation of open-pit coal mining , but does not apply to hard-rock minerals like gold . The US Bureau of Land Management is charged with overseeing mining on all federal lands ( where most Western gold mines are located ) and enforcing other environmental laws , but critics say the bureau is not doing its job . <p> " The agency 's position right now can be summed up in three words : ' Ca n't Say No , ' " says Phillip Hocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining reform research and lobbying group in Washington , D.C. <p> Some mine-company executives acknowledge that their industry must do more to protect the environment . " We do need to encourage recycling to the maximum . We do need to encourage conservation , " says R. K. Urnovitz , manager of government relations for the Northwest Mining Association in Spokane , Wash . <p> " We can not restore the land , but we can reclaim it , " says Mr. Urnovitz . " We ca n't put back every rock , but we can reclaim the land , and we can protect water quality . In fact we should be required to . " <p> A recent agreement between a Canadian company and environmental groups regarding a proposed gold mine in the East Mojave National Scenic Area of California may be a model for the future . <p> The Viceroy Gold Corporation will use enclosed storage tanks for the cyanide solution , place liners underneath the ore piles , install electronic monitors to warn of leaks , and put up fences to keep out wildlife . The company also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the mining is complete , and pay $2 million into a fund for environmental restoration . THE negotiated agreement does not fully satisfy critics who question the need for any degradation of nature to extract a mineral that is used mainly for jewelry . But the fact that Viceroy can do all of this and still make a profit is encouraging to those pushing for stricter state and federal regulations as well as tougher enforcement of existing land-use laws . <p> Although there has been no test case yet , the US Supreme Court has told states they may pass reclamation regulations . Another avenue may be reform of the 1872 US Mining Law ( see related story ) , which at present says nothing about reclaiming hard-rock mining areas . <p> " We want up-front financial security on total reclamation , " says Roy Elicker , an attorney for the National pre-mining uses , we want the topsoil replaced and native vegetation successfully reseeded . " <p> Here in Oregon , bills to protect the environment from the effects of mining are about to be considered . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmentalists say they 'll take the matter to the voters via an initiative . As the demography of the region changes from rural to urban , and with it comes greater concern for protecting the environment , the time may be ripe for change . <p> " My mother taught me if I made a mess I had to clean it up , " says Andy Kerr of the Oregon Natural Resources Council . " We do n't have any land to spare , even out West . "
