The truck skidding , myself running , getting nowhere , still hanging onto some foolish piece of laundry , a flowered pillowcase . The truck skidding silently into the tree . My body opening to a big empty scream , Molly . The scream turning to glass , nothing in it , no child . <p> I went back to work , a week or so later , after everybody had come and gone . I did n't plan it . I just found myself in front of the bathroom mirror , the first night I was alone again in the house , pulling my hair all to one side , showing in the combs . My fingers were ice cold . I put my fiddle in its case , got in the car and drove to Justice 's . <p> " Well , " Cap said into the mike . He ducked his head , strummed his guitar a little bit , checking it sideways with TJ 's bass . Then he turned back and leaned the mike toward his mouth a little . " We got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked over at me without smiling and let everyone clap and whistle . We have our regulars there now . I guess they knew the story . I tucked my fiddle under my chin . He nodded , and , my heart thudding , I arched my shoulders up and brought us into the rousing melody of " Under the Double Eagle . " <p> The fingers of my left hand flew through the patterns ; they did n't have to think . My bow waited , then plunged forward over the strings , ducking and dancing , bright sixteenths to take your mind off how the music rushes ahead , weaving and rollicking , through the ticks and socks of the time there is in this world . I waited , all wired up , for my turn to leap in there . I sent my bow singing up the strings , over the melody , reaching high and beautiful , or I was down underneath it , in the serious ranges . I worked little soft arpeggios in around the words Cap end Joyner and Louis sang . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling I was the bow . My whole body sliding sideways , just this side of a faint . <p> They were right behind me . They watched out for me , they were careful what they played , no " Six More Miles to the Graveyard . " Not that it mattered  --  I could n't hold words in my mind . " I want to play , but I 'm not singing , Cap , " I told him , that first night back . He nodded . " Fine . That 's fine . " <p> Cap , he 's as ancient as this place he comes from . His face is from early times , the flat , thrifty way it 's made , with nothing extra , the spare lips , the sharp nose that has the slight break to it just below the bridge , like the line of one of these ridges out here , the brow not high but from temple to temple broad , the bleached eyebrows , the long lines down the cheeks that come from a hard life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-developed , even in his lower arms and hands , from his strong playing on that old Dreadnaught . Veins run through his fingers and up his arms . I 'll tell you , there have been times when I have just wanted to lick the path they took . I did n't want anyone but him , he wanted everybody but me , a situation that gave me a lot of nervous energy for a while . <p> There have been times when love sat in my throat , right where you swallow . I could n't eat . But I could still sing . We sang hot songs , might as well put all that misery to good use . He lifted my voice , brought it out , loved around it on the refrains . It was as though he wanted to be invisible then , to everybody but me . Our two voices slid together trustfully , they were of one mind . His voice found the right place for itself against mine , locked onto mine like radar , through every last little edgy turn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go a long way just on harmony . <p> His body is an authority on many subjects . It knows exactly what to do with itself except when it comes to me , his old buddy Karin . <p> I stopped paying attention to it a long time ago . I stamped my desire down into friendliness . With my cute cowboy boots . I had other opportunities . I took advantage of one of them . That 's where Molly came from . I chose her father for his good humor and his genes  --  he was some kind of kin to old Fiddlin ' John Carson . Just passing through . <p> When I went back to work , after it happened , I forgot about Cap . I could n't keep my mind on him . He was the lead guitar , period . All I could keep my mind on was the music . <p> One main sound , somebody said , that first night . We were sitting at a long table between sets , drinking beer . If somebody said something funny , everybody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I laughed , Lord . I could n't talk , but my smile felt hooked to my ears . A woman I had n't seen before sat with her arm around Louis 's shoulders . She blew out smoke and said , " If you concentrate you can kind of hear it . " I strained to catch what she was saying . " And pretty soon , you hear it all the time , underneath everything . " We all got real quiet , trying to hear it under George Jones on the jukebox. " one main sound , so they say . " <p> That night I went home and sat against the wall . I tried to hear it . I heard a high tingling buzz . I wondered if that 's what she meant . <p> One main sound . It made sense , it figured . There 's one main light in the world ; everything we call color is a splitting apart of this one light . So I thought maybe there might be one great chord , too , like the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Creation would be the splitting apart of this chord . Music would come out of it , every note , every harmony . Music would also try to get back to it . <p> It was just an idea , but the idea excited me . I seemed to know what it meant ; it drew me , it comforted me . <p> I did n't hear it , not that night . The next night I did  --  just for a moment , but I was sure of what I heard . A wayoff steady chord , a full , low G major , I 'd say . Resonant and harmonic . <p> Then that was what I did . It was my work . Listening . I latched onto the idea of it . <p> I would come home from Justice 's , or wherever , at night . I would undress in the dark and put on my bathrobe and sit against the cool plaster , listening , till the light came . Then I 'd get myself something to eat , unplug the phone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off  --  it was never a really deep sleep , but I figured it was easier on me to come awake not screaming in the daylight than in the dark . I 'd get up in the afternoon and practice for a couple of hours , then somebody would show up  --  they had it divvied out by days of the week , I guess  --  to fix dinner and eat with me . Then I 'd get myself dressed and go play at Justice 's . We 'd play our three sets , then I 'd come home . <p> And sit against the wall again , trying to hear the one sound . That was the work I was doing then . <p> It went on for several weeks . The sound did finally seem to encompass everything . The names did finally fall away from things . I do n't know , I guess I was hallucinating by then . When I looked at the thing we call table , I could n't remember the name of it , did n't even want to . What was important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady particular sound in the one ongoing chord . <p> I 'm just trying to reach back and say what it was like . I ca n't make it happen now , though it happens every once in a while in spite of me . <p> Everything was within it , myself and my dead child and every breath every breather ever breathed . <p> I guess I needed to hear it . <p> Cars would go by in the street , a siren far off . The fraternity on the corner had parties with loud music ; wind blew through the maple tree , carrying the heavy back beat with it . A branch would brush the roof , or somebody on the street would call out . These separate incidental sounds of the world going on seemed like rocks that the river of the one main sound separated and flowed around . or like flashes of light thrown off of it . I began to think of it as a river . I was on its banks . <p> On its banks . The ground under my feet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what had happened ; it was final . I would never see her again . <p> I would hear it . Then I would go play my fiddle with Cap and Joyner and Louis and TJ. one night , right in the middle of " Sallie Gooden " I heard the sound . Playing was like bidding the notes to rise up out of it , one at a time , flash and shake themselves , then go back . <p> So I heard the music a new way . This hearing gave my playing a definiteness , a clean certainty , a brilliance it had n't had before . I had to concentrate ; I had to keep the one sound in my mind the whole time I was calling the separate notes out of it . <p> I was further from singing than I 'd ever been . <p> I kept my mouth shut and played to save my soul . They gave me room , they cleared out a place in the music for me and let me have my head . They did n't look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drift back and disappear . Joyner would step up quick to his mike through the applause and quiet it with that old claw-hammer banjo-picking of his that sounds like wild horses , to take everybody 's minds off what they 'd just heard . or old poker-faced Louis would crawl inside that dobro and break it loose . Then we 'd all be in it again , and Cap and Joyner and Louis would sing one last chorus . Then we 'd all step back and finally take quick sidelong glances at one another , fall to tuning or adjusting capos or taking care of busted strings , getting ready for the next number , Cap chatting the audience up while we did it , joking with Joyner like nothing unusual at all was happening . " Might ought to tune this thing , " he 'd say , and Joyner would come back , " Why mess with it now ? We was all just about to get adjusted . " <p> I smiled and joked around , I smiled and drank my beer , and all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vast , harmonic , taking in everything . I smiled , sliding sideways , the big glissando , like a leaf sliding on the wind , down and down and down , while Cap and Joyner put their heads together and sang , Some sweet day they 'll turn me loose , from this dirty old callaboose . <p> And then I 'd go home to listen again . <p> If I could have sat there a little longer . If Cap had n't come after me that night . <p> Sometimes I lost it , of course . I had to sit perfectly still for a long time sometimes . So when I got it , I would try to hold onto it . It held onto me . It folded around me , it gave me peace . It did n't matter so much then , this business of being alive or being dead . When I could keep hearing it for a long enough time , it would lift me up out of my grief-struck body . I would feel myself not just connected to but somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I would be light . <p> But Cap came and rescued me . <p> I do n't try to hear it anymore . I understand the danger , for me . But sometimes when I 'm tired , it will come over me , the way an uncatchable rush of a dream from the night before will come over me when I turn down the covers to get back into bed . <p> I sat against the wall . Then I slept or tried to . Then I practiced , first the precise , lonely singing of the scales , then the figures . I would break them apart , studying the bowing . Some of these old jig figures , slow them down and they 'll break your heart . I would fill the little house with sounds of my own making . <p> Then I would go meet the band . We were all playing beyond our abilities . It was a miracle , and we all knew it , though nobody mentioned it , except to say , once in a while , " Damn , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home and lean against the wall . That listening was the hardest work I 'd ever done . Tougher than learning the fiddle , even . Nothing dreamy or absentminded about it . <p> The darkness was full of high hums , buzzes , cracks , flutters , roars . Then these fell away , or blended . or were overcome . Toward the end , my own breathing was incidental , detached from me , far off . <p> A deep rushing , I wanted it . The image of lowering myself into it came to me . I began to think I had a choice in the matter . Thinking I had a choice helped me , made it possible for me to sleep . I 'd sleep then , a dreamless dark sleep , as far as I knew , no grief no death no loss . And when I woke , there would be at first some momentous relief , elation , as though Molly and I were together . No separation , she was with me . <p> The grief would come upon me later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew the bow over the strings . That low grieving sound of the violin . That high wild singing , and it would gather again . But I would discipline it to the scales , to the figure of the jig and hornpipe , to a grave , full tone . <p> So I gave my life over to music , and to the sound music came <p> A roar , a low powerful continuous rushing noise  --  a river , unstoppable steady swift . <p> There came a time about a month after I went back to play with the band when I did n't want to practice when I woke . I pressed my face into her clothes , still hanging in the closet . <p> I slid down the wall next to her closet , to try to hear the sound . It was a thirst , an addiction . Need entered in . I needed to enter that current . <p> When somebody showed up at my front door , with flowers , food , tapes , I would put water on for tea . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say some words myself . I was n't able to let the words into my understanding . " Talk to me , Karin , " my friend Martha would say . " I 'm all right , " I 'd say . " Like hell you are . " " No , really . Do n't baby me . " <p> I thought I was all right . I 'd get myself over to Justice 's on the nights we played there . Afterwards , I drove home fast , as soon as I could leave , with the radio turned off . I knew what I wanted . <p> Better to want the melodies . The clever progressions , temporal arrangements . Since we have to live in time . Ca n't live outside of it . I know that now . <p> The deep swift current . It was just a matter of getting up the courage . A grave ongoing sound by then , a roar . It would get quieter when it went through the rocks to where Molly was . It would be as quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get out into the middle of it , I understood , it would take me to my girl . It would carry me beyond the pale . Beyond the curb , into the street , where I had found her , and beyond that place , then , too . <p> The one most dark full sound . If I could be inside it , not just listening to it  --  <p> The sound of blood , coursing though the universe . All I needed to do was to leave the bank . on the surface it would be still , but swift underneath . The other river , underneath . <p> I got dressed in my jeans and red silk blouse , my brown boots . I put on my earrings . I tried to put on my stage makeup , looking at my faraway face in the mirror . I did n't stop exactly . I just could n't make myself hurry up , even though it was getting late . <p> I 'll just sit down for a minute , I 'll just sit down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back against the wall for a minute , and listen . It did n't matter if I was late , none of that mattered . I 'll just close my eyes for a minute . <p> I got out into the middle of it . It was easy . I just stepped out . I let it take me . I did n't breathe , the sound breathed around me , it was partly made of breath . <p> I do n't know what happened . Time passed , I guess . <p> Some rocks came that the sound had to separate and flow around . Six . They rocked my body . Then when I thought I was past that place , six more . And I thought , This is the rocky place I have to go through to get to her . <p> Loud sounds I thought I should see about . But they did n't matter . Loud , definite sounds from the place I could n't remember , like : no ! no ! no ! no ! <p> Then hard sounds coming through the rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one come down . Cap leaned toward me with a look on his face as though he 'd found me lying in a pool of blood . <p> My red silk blouse . <p> Pool of silence . <p> If I 'd known what was happening sooner , I could have gotten out the back door , run for my life . <p> He knelt on the floor beside me . He said my name . I remembered it was mine . Karin . <p> What would have happened if he had n't come ? Would I have died there ? of what ? Would I have literally opened a vein ? or just flipped out , temporarily or permanently ? Maybe I would have just sat there on the floor for a little longer , then gotten up and lived my life in a normal , regular , quiet way . <p> He knelt there , talking to me , sounding the way you do when you try to sweet-talk a cat out from under a bed . <p> He put his hand on my bare arm , flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers . I drew back , I jerked my arm back . " Leave me alone , " I said , but he held on . He wanted me to get up . He did n't know what he was doing . He was where he had no business to be . I heard his calm voice : " Come on , honey , you need to get up from there . " He did n't have a clue what I needed . I shut my eyes tight . I did n't want him in my sight . I felt in my fingers how I would choke him for interrupting me , for saying my name . I was way past the field of gravity of his take-charge voice and sexy eyes and black cowboy jacket . " I want you to leave me alone , Cap , " I said . " I want you to back off . " My voice felt chiseled . <p> His fear was in his hand tighter than he would have wanted . <p> " All right , Karin , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I 'm right here . " I did n't need him . He went somewhere a little way off , taking the bad-memory smell of bar smoke and beer with him . I suppose he went to sleep . I thought of saying his name , but that idea left me ; I forgot about him . I was far gone again into my studies . I heard him breathing , then that sound was gone , too . I was so close , so close  --  <p> But then it was first light and he was sitting on the edge of my bed putting his boots back on . I saw him , far back , a distant memory . I could hardly place him . " How long has it been since you ate ? " he asked . <p> I knew then that my only hope was to get up off the floor and act natural , so he would leave . I found my legs , I stood up shakily . I took a shower and got dressed . He was in the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His jeans still had a crease in them . I wanted to ask , " Does your grandma iron them for you or do you send them to the laundry ? " He put a plate of eggs in front of me ; I ate them to get rid of them . I said , " I 'm fine now . Thank you . You go on now , Cap . " <p> " I 'll drop by around two-thirty . See if you can sleep some now . " <p> " I will . You do n't need to be worrying about me . You got enough to do . " <p> He put his hands on my shoulders . His eyes moved over my face , like he was checking to see if I had a rash . " I 'll be by this afternoon . " <p> I went to the window and saw him swing up into his van and back it down the driveway . Two-thirty , then . I did n't think I 'd need that long . When he was out of sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I 'd been , dropped right back into it . No problem , no problem anymore . <p> A loud , serious working sound , like machinery now . I was getting somewhere fast . Then , to my joy and amazement , I began to think I could hear something else , behind the clanking roar  --  a perfect sweet silence . I ca n't tell you the quality of it . It was like a wide expanse of still , pure water . I think now you must hear this sound right before you die . or right afterwards . I tell you , I could see the rocks I had to go through to get to her . I could see through them , a little , to some beyond . A radiance . A sweet loving shine . I was on my way , I really think I was . <p> As close as I 'll ever get and live to tell the tale . <p> I do n't know what was in store for me . I do n't know what would have happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as I can the feeling of what I was moving toward . Freedom , peace . Still , silverwater , golden light . Gathering momentum-too late to stop myself ; I was into the rapids already . I surged forward , excited . I forgot everything , except that there was plenty of time , that I would know what to do , that there would be time to do it . That the way to do it would be clear to me . <p> Then there was Cap again , as if he came down out of thin air . I did n't know he was there until he knelt swiftly to lift me . Too soon ! was all I could think , bitterly . A trick . ( I do n't know whether it was a trick or not . I 'd lost track of time . It could have been 2:30. or 10:15 . To this day , I ca n't be sure whether he lied to me . I thought at the time he had , to trick me , and I hated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events of that day , till evening , are a blur to me . ) <p> He did n't talk this time , he just knelt fast to lift me . But I was fast , too . All instinct , fighting for my life . I grabbed his arms , we grappled together . I slapped him , scratched at him . I had come so far , it had been so hard , I 'd had so much to learn . I was almost there , dear God ! And here comes Cap , taking it upon himself to pull me back , out of the solemn , sacred current of that river . " Who the hell do you think you are ? " I screamed at him , my voice sounding ripped from my guts . <p> He held me off . He warded off my slaps and kicks and struggled this way and that , till holding me off turned into holding . <p> Until this dead-serious wrestling turned into what I 'd always wanted from him , but not then . And then I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current , even as I fought with him , even as he lifted me away from it . Tears running down his face . They stopped me . Tears . <p> I let go of it . of the chance to go through to my girl . I let go . Like a hand unclutching , like fingers forced open . <p> He held me then , cradled me , rocked me . My muscles were all so tight . They 'd been clenched ever since she died . His hands moved then , knowing how to help me . To help my poor old body . He put me on the bed to help me . Everything happened then , I wanted it to . The old thing with Cap , flashing out , leaping out of the darkness I had made . Grief and lust ringing against each other , like I 'd swallowed a set of church bells . <p> Going down , sliding down . our bodies sliding , giving in to it , at last . Easy , the pure release of it , like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I breathed . Necessary . No keeping from it . I let a different kind of darkness in then , like the darkness at the center of a plant that the stalk shoots through . That dark and that real and that living . The realest thing that ever happened to me , happening almost in sight of Molly , of her everlastingness . How will I ever straighten that out ; Grief and lust , sorrow and love . As if there 's one deep place that every real thing comes out of and when we 're in that place 's charge , there are n't any rules , it 's just being swept along without any will whatsoever . <p> I could n't help it , I sank down into the mattress . The same one Molly and I had slept on together when she crawled in at night to press against me . I could n't help it . I was pulling him down then , into that dark , sliding dark center of me that does n't know anything but wanting and not having and having . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the two of us . His eyes full of the same shining darkness , his grave face yielding , those lines around his mouth . His neat hard brown hands , bringing me , bringing me . <p> Back to life . <p> Come back , come back , each side called out . Each side said the other side was death . Love was on both sides . I had to choose . I chose to go back to the side I knew about . <p> Oh , little screamer , cheeks all flushed out . Bright eyes , coming back for more , shrieking and swinging that feather pillow around your head , blond tangled hair flying . <p> I feel I 've failed her twice . I did n't look , the one time when I should have been looking . I took my eyes off of her and down the driveway she went , her legs held out from the pedals , coasting , free . And afterwards , when I almost had her in my sight , when I felt her right there waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears running down his face . Crying for everything , I guess . I held onto him , for poor dear life . <p> Toward evening , he took me to stay with his grandma in the country . He drove with one hand , his eyes wide open in the wind , looking straight ahead . All I heard were the tires on the road , something singing in the fields , crickets , I guess . I closed my eyes and nearly slept . It was her smallness I remembered then ; death made her so little . And right on top of that , a kind of dream , merciful . I dreamt I was dressing her . Combing her hair , putting on her best pink dress . It felt ceremonious , as though I were getting her ready to be married , or to take communion or something . Something religious . She stood still while I clasped her locket . She buckled her own white sandals over her pink socks with lace at the cuffs . She was excited . So was I. I opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mackerel clouds , converging to a point in the east . White cows with the last long light of the clear day making them glow against the fields , as though lit from underneath . The beginning pink of the sunset , over on the other side . <p> <p> By Mary Ann Taylor-Hall <p>
