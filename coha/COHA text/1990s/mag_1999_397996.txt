From Democratic campaigns to the the Kosovo campaign , a long way . <p> After the Cold War , miracles abounded , large and small . One of those-smallish but interesting-was the rebirth of Madeleine K. Albright as what ? A hawk ? A freedom fighter ? John Foster Dulles in a skirt and floppy hat ? Albright 's transformation has indeed been amazing . This is not the woman we knew for all those years , when , as a leading Democratic voice on foreign policy , she was assailing Ronald Reagan and his band-even George Bush and his-as reckless , warmongering , and dangerous . America is , to be sure , the land of self-reinvention ; long may it be . Yet the secretary of state 's metamorphosis-the emergence of the New Albright , as striking as any New Nixon-has gone all but unnoticed . <p> The Kosovo war was widely considered Albright 's doing , as she had been the Clinton-administration official who pressed most insistently for it . It was also considered something of a personal project : Albright was born in Czechoslovakia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of her relatives-the family was Jewish-were killed in the camps ; others , luckier , were trapped in a Communist state . She herself was luckiest of all , brought to America , where her opportunities proved limitless . She naturally views Eastern Europe as her region and the Kosovo horror as her special responsibility . In May , Time magazine featured her on its cover , with the legend " Albright at War . " The photo showed her at her most bellicose : in a military jacket , complete with insignia , at an air base in Germany , barking into a cellular phone . Her face was the very picture of toughness and resolve . By comparison , Margaret Thatcher during the Falklands War was a whimpering doe . <p> Albright now portrays herself-and is uniformly portrayed in the press-as a child of Munich ; that is , a woman stamped forever by the deal struck in that city in 1938 , which sacrificed Czechoslovakia to the Nazi beast and , in fact , did not prevent broader war . She takes pains to explain that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foe of any aggressor . Yet this is largely how Reagan 's men , and Bush 's , saw themselves , and she mocked them constantly and opposed their every significant effort . " My mindset is Munich , " she now assures us ; " most of my generation 's is Vietnam . " Her boss , President Clinton , recently praised her for " not only learning the lessons of Munich , but also of Czechoslovakia under Communism . " According to Time , she was stalwart at a 1998 meeting of foreign ministers , held in London . The Italians and French proposed that the group use softer language toward the Serbs . Albright 's aide , Jamie Rubin , whispered to her that she should probably accept . She apparently shot back , " Where do you think we are , Munich ? " <p> With each passing day , she sounds more and more like her old bogeyman , Reagan , sometimes even mimicking his precise language . She reminds the public that America is the world 's " indispensable nation . " What is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the principle that aggression does n't pay . " In an eerie echo of what the Reaganauts used to insist about Nicaragua , she sniffs , " Just because you ca n't act everywhere does n't mean you do n't act anywhere . " We almost expect her to look at her detractors , shake her head with a sad smile , and quip , " There you go again . " <p> Just as it was considered , in some quarters , impolite in the 1940s and ' 50s to discuss who had done what in the world war , and just as it was considered , again in some quarters , impolite in the 1970s and ' 80s to discuss who had done what in the Vietnam War , it is now considered impolite to reflect on who did what-and stood for what-during the Cold War . Recriminations are bad form . Yet a little wonderment is well nigh irresistible . Ronald Reagan , in his speech to the 1992 Republican convention , one of his last addresses , said that he had heard " those speakers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , ' We won the Cold War . ' And I could n't helping thinking , ' What do you mean " we " ? ' " Caspar Weinberger , Reagan 's defense secretary , can now only chuckle bemusedly at Albright 's new persona : " The kindest way of putting it is that she has seen the light and realizes the error of her ways . Who knows ? Maybe she 's been reading Margaret Thatcher 's memoirs . " <p> Albright 's story , in every way , is a peculiarly American one : A refugee , the daughter of a diplomat , she married into a newspaper fortune , made all the right connections , became a Washington hostess , and maneuvered her way to the very top of the profession she extravagantly loves . For almost her entire career , she spoke for dovish , unassertive , accommodationist positions , not at all dissimilar to the ones she is presently deriding as weak , **25;1044;TOOLONG un-American . She was , for example , a fierce opponent of the Gulf War . In March 1991 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war they had sought to block had gone so well and proven so popular with the public . Albright was there to comfort them and buck them up . She observed irritably , " All problems ca n't be solved by bombing the bejesus out of some small country . " <p> Three years earlier , a U.S. warship had shot down an Iranian airliner . This was a horrible , tragic mistake-not unlike , say , the bombing of a Chinese embassy , or a Swedish ambassadorial residence , or a hospital ( all of which occurred in the Kosovo war ) . But Albright castigated the Reaganauts for " murdering innocent people . " About her ( now ) " indispensable nation , " she crabbed , " We have been brought up to believe that we are special , but we have not been behaving as if we are special . " <p> In both words and deeds , Madeleine Albright has-no doubt-come a long way . THE PATH TO GLORY <p> Albright got her start , so to speak , in the early 1970s , when her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She busied herself with school affairs , including fundraising , for which she showed a particular aptitude . Her talents came to the attention of a fellow parent who was working on the presidential campaign of Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine . Would Albright like to organize a big-money dinner for the candidate at a local hotel ? She would be delighted , and she did it well . Muskie lost the 1972 Democratic nomination to George McGovern , but Albright later landed a position on the Muskie staff , first as a fundraiser and then as a legislative assistant . <p> In 1976 , Albright received a Ph.D . in political science from Columbia , begun in the 1960s when the family lived in New York . Among her professors had been Zbigniew Brzezinski , the canny , tough-minded Pole whom President Carter would select as his national security advisor . When he went to the White House , Brzezinski plucked his old student from Muskie 's office , making her his congressional liaison . Remembers one who worked with her then , " She was always dovish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Brzezinski , as it concerned the Soviet Union . She was n't crazy-liberal , but she was nowhere near Zbig . " In 1988 , Brzezinski would refuse to endorse Albright 's candidate , Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis , whom he did not trust to safeguard the national interest . <p> After Carter 's defeat at the hands of Reagan in 1980 , Albright settled into life as a Georgetown hostess and networker . She was known for the dinners she staged at her home on 32nd Street , where out-of-power Democrats would go to chew over their dilemma and carp about the trigger-happy simpletons who had captured the executive branch . " These are working dinners , " she once said defensively , " where people can surface their ideas to see what their validity is . People do n't come for the food . " She also arranged for a teaching position at Georgetown University , where she headed the Women in Foreign Service program . Her principal and abiding concern , however , was Democratic politics and the long wait for the Republicans to leave town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to help elect a Democrat president . " <p> In 1984 , her horse , naturally , was Walter F. Mondale , whom she advised-even though , as it happens , he would smirk at those in thrall to , as he put it , " what I call ' the Munich analogy ' " ( as though he had invented the phrase ) . Albright was also chief foreign-policy counselor to the vice-presidential nominee , Geraldine Ferraro , who became a close friend . Recalled Ferraro later , " We hit it off right away . We tape-recorded our conversations , and I used to take the tapes with me and listen to them in the bathtub . " <p> In this campaign , as before and after , Albright railed tirelessly against the Reagan administration for what she viewed as its undue belligerence toward the Soviet Union , its appalling adventurism around the globe , and its frightening and destabilizing defense buildup . She rarely put her positions on paper-indeed , she has written next to nothing , barely having even an op-ed piece to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she dispensed with professionalism and zest . " We have a president , " she complained , " who seems to have a mindset against arms control . " In 1980 , Reagan had asked his famous question , " Are you better off than you were four years ago ? " This time around , Albright argued , " the question should be , Do you feel safer ? " The answer , she believed , should have been an obvious no . <p> If Albright was not an unambiguous nuclear-freezenik , she was certainly a fellow traveler of that movement . " Arms-control debates up to now have been carried on by the cognoscenti , " she said , " and if you did n't understand the details of throw-weight , you could n't participate intelligently . But one thing the freeze movement has done is strip away some of that mystique . " A critical issue of the day was that of the " Euromissiles " - nuclear weapons that Reagan deployed in Western Europe in the face of tremendous pressure and even at the cost of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later returned , enabling Reagan to fashion his most advantageous pacts ) . Mondale was , to some degree , in favor of the deployment , provided it was coupled with " sustained negotiations . " Ferraro flat-out opposed . As for Albright , she seems not to have declared herself unequivocally , but she did denounce " Reagan 's definition of strength , " which included " a destabilizing weapon like the MX , an unnecessary bomber like the B-1 , and an unrealistic defense system like Star Wars . " <p> So too was she contemptuous of the 1983 invasion of Grenada . " Of course Grenada worked , " she scoffed on television . " It was the Redskins of the National Football League versus the Little Sisters of the Poor , and the score was 101 to nothing . " Mondale allowed that he could have supported the operation if it had been truly necessary , as the Reagan administration claimed , " to save American lives " - but not for any strategic reason . Ferraro forthrightly opposed the invasion because she did not accept that Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Dukakis would state that " the only legitimate basis for our invading Grenada was to protect American lives and property , " adding , " I 'm not sure we 'll ever know whether or not American lives and property were in jeopardy . " AGAINST REAGAN AND BUSH , UNFAILINGLY <p> Mondale and Ferraro , of course , went on to lose 49 states . Albright went back to her dinners , her politicking , and her television appearances . She never missed a chance to tweak Reagan and his team for their unreasonable muscularity . As one of her Republican adversaries at the time observes , " She was out of office , so whatever the Republicans were doing-it really did n't matter what-she had to support the opposite . And that demanded that she be dovish . " In 1986 , for instance , in one of her scores of interviews on the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour , Albright chastised the administration for its expulsion of 55 Soviets from the United States-persons who , in the classic euphemism , had " engaged in activities incompatible with their diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she noted , " I would consider this kind of counterproductive if you are trying to improve the U.S.-Soviet dialogue . " The expulsion had been " a little quick , " and " I do n't think the numbers had to be quite so large , " because , for Moscow , it was " such a slap in the face . " After all , she said , in one of her trademark simplifications , " Do we want an arms-control agreement or do we want to kind of have a more hostile relationship with the Soviet Union ? " <p> By the time the 1988 campaign rolled around , Albright was itching to be principal advisor to the Democratic Number One-and she became so . She remarked to an interviewer , " I 've worked very hard to get my credentials together , and I have the feeling I am able at this stage to make a contribution . " In Dukakis , however , she had a shaky product . He had been a true freezenik , and there were few important Democrats to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him like mad , claiming , hilariously , that he was " an active internationalist in the tradition of Harry Truman and John Kennedy . " Dukakis , she said , " has a very good sense that our security problems consist of more than guns : It also consists of the threat to our economic viability , the deficit , " and so on-a standard Democratic line of the period . Besides which , said Albright , Dukakis " will not be going around taking unilateral action like some lonesome cowboy . " She would hit this " lonesome cowboy " theme hard , saying at another point , " The role of the U.S. is not to impose our views on our allies like some lonesome cowboy " <p> Over and over , Albright bristled at the contention that Reagan 's military refortification and his robust , anti-Communist foreign policy had enhanced the nation 's position around the globe and brought about a sounder relationship with the Soviet Union , not to mention undreamed-of arms control . " Peace Through Strength " was , to her , a lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that the military buildup " had anything to do with a safer world . In 1989 , she would say , in a typical formulation , " The irony of all this is that Ronald Reagan tells us that he won the Cold War , and , whether it 's over or not , he bankrupted our budget so we do not have the funds to take advantage of the massive changes . We 're absolutely hogtied to the idea we have to have a Stealth bomber and two mobile missiles . " We simply " do not have enough money , " she griped , " and part of that has to do with , I think , a misconstruing of how we did win the Cold War . " <p> Throughout the campaign , she blasted the Republican nominee , George Bush , for his " Cold War rhetoric " : " I do n't think we need to go around rattling sabers . " She objected to his " referring back to the terminology of the Cold War " in a speech at Fulton , Mo. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transgression was having " basically talked about the Iron Curtain and used a lot of terminology that made us look backward . " Nowhere to be found was the blunt , truth-valuing Albright of the Kosovo war . <p> Most extraordinary was an interview she gave in October 1988 on a television show called American Interests , hosted by Morton Kondracke . Antimissile defenses were a hot topic of the hour , and almost the whole of the Democratic party opposed them , although a few were willing to countenance their use as a " bargaining chip " with the Soviets . Albright lambasted Reagan 's prized project as " a fantasy , " and " therefore , in terms of discussing bargaining chips , what do we gain out of it , of spending trillions of dollars on a fantasy program ? " But was it not true , pressed Kondracke , that , whatever its feasibility , the program had spooked and depressed the Soviets , driving them to greater concessions ? " I think there 's a real question about what drove them , " answered Albright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic trouble . In my estimation , the Soviets are not impressed when you have billions of dollars in deficit , when you are building weapons that do n't work , or when you , in effect , are putting money into some crazy astrodome plan of the sky . " <p> Then there was the matter of Nicaragua and the Reagan Doctrine-the policy , christened by journalist Charles Krauthammer , of backing insurgency movements against Communist dictatorships . If Dukakis were elected , asked Kondracke , would that be the end of the Reagan Doctrine ? " You bet , " Albright replied . " Especially as far as Central America is concerned . " She favored the " Arias Plan " for Nicaragua , named for the Costa Rican president who would win the Nobel peace prize , a plan , she said , that the Reagan administration had given " the back of its hand . " The Reaganauts were at fault because " they 've always held out the option that the aid to the contras would be resumed . " And " the result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ortegas an excuse to militarize their society . " The United States , as imperialist meddler , had gone " swaggering around " and now Reagan was " afraid that peace might break out . " <p> Albright did allow , on another occasion , that aid to the mujahadeen in Afghanistan was legitimate , because " the Soviets invaded Afghanistan , and nobody invaded Nicaragua . " Moreover , " aid to the contras has provided the Sandinistas with an excuse for further repression . " In her opinions and language , Albright in this period differed little from the leading scourges of the administration on Central America-Jim Wright , David Bonior , Christopher Dodd . TOWARD A NEW LIFE <p> After Dukakis 's battering at the polls , Albright became president of a liberal Democratic think tank , the Center for National Policy , among whose founders were Vernon Jordan , Cyrus Vance , and even Warren Beatty . When President Bush launched the Gulf War , Albright was aghast , arguing for a continuation of sanctions and negotiations . None of her arguments in the Balkans today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts at diplomatic stalling , Albright explained , " The Soviets want Saddam Hussein to save face , and the U.S. wants his head . " Bush had unwisely " personalized " the conflict : the American president versus the Butcher of Baghdad . Some months after the war 's conclusion , Albright , noting problems in Yugoslavia , was conspicuously crotchety and bitter at what Bush had accomplished in the Gulf : " We are so busy celebrating how we managed to institute world order in the Persian Gulf that it is interesting to see how powerless we seem to be in this situation . " A year after that , when the administration was considering whether to attack Iraq again , Albright said , " If Bush has to go in and bomb Iraq now , he may only point up that he screwed up the first time . " Whether Albright , at this remove-following her own experiences in Iraq , Yugoslavia , and elsewhere-has any greater sympathy for her predecessors remains unclear . <p> With the end of the Cold War , Albright , like the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even felt free , in a 1992 USA Today column , to speak of " totalitarian evil . " And when she joined the Clinton administration as U.N . ambassador in 1993-her shot at the big leagues at last-she was known as rather hardline , particularly in contrast to her colleagues , such as Warren Christopher , Sandy Berger , and Strobe Talbott . Her rhetoric became practically Churchillian . She had a well-publicized tussle over Bosnia with Colin Powell , then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , during which she asked , " What 's the point of having this superb military you 're always talking about if we ca n't use it ? " When interrogated by reporters about the necessity of the 1994 invasion of Haiti , she snapped , " If Haiti were threatened by Communism , none of you would be raising these questions " - yet Albright , when she had her chance in the Cold War , usually shrank from what others , fortunately , were prepared to do . <p> Albright has led a genuinely impressive life , and there is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent biographies of her-one by Washington Post reporter Michael Dobbs and the other by Time 's Ann Blackman . She has always been privileged by material wealth , but she is acquainted with struggle , not least because of a brutal divorce in 1983-without which , she has said repeatedly , she would not have been spurred to her present success . But neither of her biographers really touches on her positions in the final stage of the Cold War or seeks to hold her to account for them . Nor does anyone else . We are surely not in the business of handing out white feathers , but we may well ask , Where were you when we needed you , and , Have you gained any appreciation of the hard , often thankless work performed by those who concluded the " long twilight struggle " ? It is they , we might cluck , who made it relatively safe for Albright , Clinton , Talbott , and Berger to hold high office . Caspar Weinberger concedes that it is tempting to resent the near-total absence of self-examination and humility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way . " <p> So Madeleine Albright has flexed her muscles in Kosovo . She is heralded as the conscience of the West , the benefactor of millions , the scourge of another genocidal-though this time not mustachioed-dictator . In May , turning to her , Clinton said , " Secretary Albright , thank you for being able to redeem the lessons of your life story by standing up for the freedom of the people in the Balkans . " Albright is indeed a heroine to Kosovars and others staving off murder and degradation . To them , she is a positively Reagan-like figure-just another miracle of this new , decidedly better age . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By JAY NORDLINGER <p>
