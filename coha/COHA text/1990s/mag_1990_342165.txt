Long before they elected him mayor in 1987 , Nashville voters knew that William H. Boner was no Goody Two-Shoes . As a Democratic Congressman he had been cited by the House ethics committee for milking campaign funds for personal gain . Before that , in 1985 , federal prosecutors scrutinized some of the services he performed for a defense contractor who paid Boner 's lawyer- wife Betty fees totaling $44,000 in 22 months . Still , when newly elected Mayor Boner exulted three years ago that he felt " like a child in a candy store , " Nashvillians did not know just what he meant . <P> As it turned out , Boner 's exultation was a prelude to a pair of spectacular sexual escapades . First , while still married to third wife Betty , Boner had a fling with a female bodyguard . Then he lurched into a love affair with a willowy aspiring country-music singer named Traci Peel , 35 , who joked to the press that the mayor made love to her for seven consecutive hours . <P> One tabloid dubbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in embarrassment . After Boner 's divorce from Betty and marriage to Peel , the city 's mortification peaked when the Boners appeared on Phil Donahue 's TV show to discuss , among other matters , the mayor 's alleged sexual prowess . Boner also played harmonica while a rambunctious Peel sang Rocky Top . Donahue rightly charged that Boner 's conduct came " very close to giving the finger " to Nashville . And Nashville seemed ready by last week to reciprocate . Unfortunately , Boner 's constituents have found that the city charter fails to provide for recall . Unless he decides to resign  --  or collapses in his bedroom  --  it looks as if Nashville is stuck with him for another 11 months .
