PICTURES FROM THE YEAR EMOTIONS RULED <P> " It is distressing that violence , beauty and celebrity rank higher than Mother Teresa , who dedicated her entire life to a noble cause . " AARTI SWAMINARAYAN Mount Prospect , Ill . <P> It would be naive to think that the emotions of 1997 were not influenced by the press and photographers IMAGES ' 97 , Dec. 22 . I fear the amount of influence the media have in shaping the perception of events , a misgiving that was reinforced by your theme , " Pictures from a Year the News Turned Emotional . " That fear is , unfortunately , justified when good judgment is not exercised . The close-up photograph of Evander Holyfield 's ear not only turned my stomach ( again ) but also made me ashamed of our culture . Perhaps you should try harder to ensure that the method you use to invoke emotion in your readers is not sensationalistic . SARA PILAR BRYANT Melrose , Mass . <P> I was disturbed by the cynicism reflected in Roger Rosenblatt 's piece " The Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming public reaction to Princess Diana 's death . It was not just " one loss and absence too many " or the mourning of a " lovely presence . " Diana tried to make a real difference in the world through her numerous causes . She had the ability to affect people 's lives in a positive way . DIANE CARDLIN DONOGHUE Rockville Centre , N.Y . <P> Once again Diana on your cover . Enough ! You have earned yourselves a place in your own " Di-Ploitation Watch . " LEEOR KRONIK Tel Aviv <P> The striking two-page photo of Princess Diana deserves Shakespeare 's complete quotation , not just a portion of it : " Age can not wither her , nor custom stale/Her infinite variety ... " YOLANDA LOPEZ-HEAD Glendale , Calif . <P> Rosenblatt 's article was good , but I hardly believe that in 1997 people were driven by " apocalyptic , fin-de-siecle anxieties about the approaching millennium . " It is true that people get touchy when encountering the finale of a century , and even more so at the end of a millennium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murders and a highly emotional society are not produced by the end of a period of time ; they lie in human nature . JANET M. BOLLERO Rosario , Argentina <P> I fail to understand the importance you give to Diana . She certainly was a beautiful woman , with an excellent sense of style , but for the press to print stories about her constantly and inflate her image is silly . A.M. RIYAAZ USMAN Kerala , India <P> LYING ON YOUR RESUME <P> If not for a peripheral imbroglio , the fact that the late Ambassador M. Larry Lawrence fabricated information about his past would never have been revealed PUBLIC EYE , Dec. 22 . People can get away with telling stories because the recipients of these tales deceive themselves as much as the liars do . As head of an executive search firm , I find it necessary to warn candidates pointedly in my first meeting with them that I will verify all the claims they make about their credentials . Without this warning , some people would brazenly continue the interview process with little concern for accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
