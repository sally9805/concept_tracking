<p> THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT BILL GATES would lend America a brief glimpse of his Leonardo da Vinci notebook , the Codex Leicester , was less surprising than the venue he chose : the American Museum of Natural History . Notwithstanding the possibility that the notebook might temporarily push the Haida canoe out of its mooring in the 77th Street lobby , Leonardo himself would have felt right at home . For him , the investigation and representation of reality went hand in hand . Scientist and artist were indivisible . <p> Yet , for all its scientific interest , the notebook compels attention as the record of a supremely artistic intelligence ; indeed , it seems as if it belongs across Central Park at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , among the masters rather than the mastodons . Is this , after all , natural history or art history , art or artifact ? <p> Visitors who venture beyond the exhibit , which opens in October , are sure to ask this question because so many of the objects in the Natural History Museum would sit comfortably across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally because of accidents of history and the fact that objects from places like Oceania , Mexico and South America had little artistic status until well into this century . <p> It 's hard to see why the blockbuster King Tut exhibit should n't have come to the Natural History Museum or why the " Royal Tombs of Sipan " installation , which presented Moche artifacts from northern Peru , should n't have wowed visitors at the Met . Although the kind of objects in art and natural history museums may be the same , there are profound differences in the way we experience them in the two settings . <p> The biggest difference is that there is n't any art in a natural history museum , even though the objects themselves tell us that making art has been a defining activity of every civilization . The American Museum of Natural History displays thousands of man-made objects , from masks to bow staves , totems to tomb sculpture , many among the finest of their kind , but they are n't there for esthetic pleasure . As Enid Schildkrout , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , puts it , " The objects offer a window on particular cultures , and if I have to choose between a beautiful object and one that more effectively makes a point , I will , often regretfully , choose the latter . " <p> An art museum provides a timeless realm of " permanence and enduring quality , " according to Philippe de Montebello , director of the Metropolitan , and even the most disparate and foreign objects become contemporary and accessible . At a natural history museum , on the other hand , all is culture-bound , and the subjective words " quality " and " beauty " never grace a label . The displays are left the dull task of providing context , sometimes bombarding visitors with information , background music , photographs and even video loops . Yet there is in this artless plethora of forms a wonderful freedom to unite our senses with what we can glean from labels for some revelations about art and life . <p> It requires fortitude . In the Hall of Mexico on the Natural History Museum 's second floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronologies and geographical schemes devised to explain it all , are overwhelming . <p> The eye immediately seeks a life raft on the ocean of objects . Hard to miss are a copy of a monumental Olmec head and the famous Kunz ax , a jaguar-faced carved jade club , also Olmec . If you resist the urge to panic in the high water , however , you will find on the north wall , under the label " Olmec style , " a small fragment of a face , just the lips , teeth and part of a nose , a sculptural sound bite as riveting as any image by Magritte . The fragment , divorced from the rest of what would have been a broad , flat face , comes from one of the early cultures of central Mexico , Tlatilco , though it looks Roman . It demonstrates how an artistic style is really a complicated blend of effects and why evaluating " naturalism " in art is a slippery endeavor . <p> We do n't know much about the original Olmec people , who were established as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington ) , or how their approaches spread so widely throughout Mexico . This small fragment probably would n't be displayed in a museum of masterpieces , yet it plays off the entire vast assemblage , forcing us to look twice at everything that came after . <p> We feel the need for words like beauty and quality even more in the Hall of Man in Africa . The cast metalwork of Benin and the intricately carved ivory of Zaire , to take just two examples , tell us that art is a central preoccupation here . The hall , however , displays objects as examples of the varied human response to Africa 's natural environments . This can be misleading . Nowhere do we learn , for example , that the Mangbetu people adopted the representation of human beings only after extensive contacts with the West had developed a market for the style . Art did not follow nature in any sense . <p> Art disrupts the classroom in delightful ways . In the case containing African musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of northern Zaire resembles a giant piggy bank . The label tells us how important the huge drum was for " inter-village communication " in the Congo . Its most striking features , however , are its buffalo head and tail . They served as handles , but they also offer an apt metaphor for sonic carrying power : some gongs could be heard 15 miles away . The extra dimension of artistic playfulness stands out all the more clearly for the object 's being presented as something supremely useful . <p> The more useful objects we look at , the more we begin to suspect that necessity is merely a pretext for making art . Much of the museum 's anthropological collections could be classed as decorative arts , a label suggesting shoe design and wallpaper . In the Andean textiles section of the Hall of South American Peoples , however , the term " decorative " quickly loses its meaning . <p> The exhibit , with its detailed descriptions of weaving techniques , is a monument to the obsession of the archeologist Junius Bird , who undertook the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the earliest known fragments . Weaving is one of the oldest arts , and the Andean peoples devised an incredible variety of ways to turn thread into fabric . They even used bat hair . The Natural History Museum exhibit reveals how much energy , skill and resources were poured into so-called decoration . <p> Cultures have dominant technologies , and these shape their art . It is almost as if the development of the backstrap loom enabled the full range of human expression in the Andes . A fragment adorned with figures wearing bird headdresses is the first known example in the Americas of slit-weave tapestry . Its companion , a complete mantle in the early Nazca style , depicts row upon row of masked figures , perhaps bearing trophy heads . Cloth marked time , told stories , announced rank and placated enemies . In many areas , weaving took up more time than any activity but food production . <p> We are used to thinking of art as a rather specialized function , done by artists for the narrow purposes of expression and entertainment . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main business of life . By never mentioning art and displaying nothing but art , however , the natural history museum shows us that art is what human beings seem to do all the time , in every circumstance , everywhere , with full awareness that the energy they devote to it exceeds the need . We are a transforming species , after all , bringing things into being from disparate materials . Art is the ultimate sign of our power to transform . <p> Art for art 's sake ? Not exactly . and yet in the museum 's North Pacific Hall , we come face to face with a vision of art at the center of life . The cultures of the Pacific coast of Canada and Alaska found their principal mode of expression in carvings and masks . The hall is dominated by huge totems , forests of which stood in front of Haida and Kwakiutl villages . Cases are filled with masks representing spiders , fish , birds and other creatures . Some are hinged and can open to transform the visage of the wearer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIFFERENT AS THE anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss and the Abstract Expressionist painter Barnett Newman have seen in the hall conclusive proof that no civilization can claim artistic pre-eminence . Where most of the museum 's halls attempt context , this hall achieves something more . Will Taylor 's 1910-26 murals , depicting aspects of Northwest Coast life and customs , would n't qualify today as textbook illustrations , but they build a bridge between worlds . <p> They present the response of an artist in one civilization to the art of another . They create a place  --  neither esthetic heaven nor didactic classroom  --  where we can begin to experience another way of being human . Which is why we go to the museum in the first place . In a spider mask or a notebook by Leonardo , we rediscover , as the philosopher Miguel de Unamuno said , that " all we are given is possibilities . "
