BY DAVID KIRKPATRICK 0 The word is in : The company that for years has led the boom in stocks and technology-in the entire economy-is not only a monopolist but a threat to consumers . Now the question becomes , Are we crazy here , or what ? Is this some form of national neurosis , subverting ourselves at our most successful ? Are we going out of our way to burst the very bubble we 've ridden so happily and profitably for so long ? How can Microsoft have hurt consumers by tying its Windows operating system to a Web browser , the PC software we use most ? And how can we say that Microsoft has stifled innovation , as Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson claims ? Could we handle any more than we 've got now ? Managers at Microsoft do n't seem to be reveling in any sense of monopolistic impregnability . If anything , they see the Web-ward shift as just one of a series of immense challenges afoot in the technology landscape . During a recent round of interviews at the company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all about government intervention . ( The conversations took place before Judge Jackson 's ruling . ) Instead , they were obsessed with the ongoing upheaval in the software industry . The biggest challenge , said President Steve Ballmer , is that " the industry will undergo a transformation over the next several years , in which software increasingly becomes a service rather than a packaged product . The distinction between application and service wo n't be meaningful . " Delivering software in the form of a service means big change for Microsoft-and meant as much even before Judge Jackson 's " findings of fact . " The Web allows applications to be accessed by a browser and delivered in a Web page , with processing and storage taking place mostly on a high-powered , Net-connected server that can be located anywhere . But this way of doing things makes PC operating systems like Microsoft 's increasingly irrelevant . Any device with any operating system that runs a Web browser can be your platform for highly productive computing . Says Jim Moore of GeoPartners Research , an Internet investment company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes the PC less central . " Microsoft is plunging into the services fray nonetheless . Executives insist that they have no choice-evidence , they say , that their monopoly does n't exist . " Software as service " is the mantra heard across the company 's campus right now . Microsoft already has one successful software service in its Hotmail free e-mail , now used by 50 million . And only days after the judge issued his finding , the company introduced Microsoft Office Online , a radical break from the way the company has made money up until now . In the past customers had to purchase a single Office license for each user ( Office accounted for 33% of company revenue last year , calculates Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter ) , but now people can rent the software 's capabilities on a monthly basis from service providers , including British Telecom and Qwest . Says Paul Maritz , who oversees Microsoft 's relations with software developers : " You can view software-as-a-service as a huge threat to our existing business , because that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can view it as upside . Frankly , I do n't know . " That kind of uncertainty would have been hard to find at Microsoft even a few years ago . CEO Bill Gates calls the service trend one of his " key strategic concerns " but , ever the upbeat technomarketer , he sees it ultimately as good news for the company . In an e-mail to FORTUNE , he writes , " Microsoft is in an incredibly strong position to build the best software service business-managing , updating , maintaining , and backing up your platform , network , apps , file sharing , etc ; building connected apps that will make knowledge workers more efficient , and offering consumer services such as content and calendaring . " Microsoft is also furiously trying to accommodate the related movement away from PCs toward a proliferating array of specialpurpose , " smart " devices . Craig Mundie , the company 's consumer strategist , says soon we will be dealing with six different " computing platform families . " He says these families will include the PC ; television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automation , security , and health ; and the car . Some of the company 's enemies would like to split it up into separate companies for Windows and applications . But many of these new devices will have but a single function . The operating system and application will be indivisible . Why should Microsoft be prevented from participating in what will probably be the next big phase of computing , a phase some smaller companies are already better prepared for than Microsoft itself ? It would be silly and reckless to take a PC-centric approach to regulating Microsoft just as the PC is becoming less and less important . Microsoft 's ability to stay on top is by no means assured . It may be that , at one level , Judge Jackson 's findings will prove to be a direct boon to consumers . Many in Redmond think that until recently the company did n't show enough sensitivity to what customers really wanted ; that Microsoft is thinking this way now is probably a direct consequence of the trial , though nobody there would admit it . Earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure , organizing its four divisions not around the products they make but the markets they serve-knowledge workers , IT professionals , software developers , and consumers . There is endless verbiage at the company these days about listening carefully to customers . Says Ballmer : " The only way you get to have a good business is by serving the customer well . Our people understand that . There 's no magic .... Consumers will pick the products and services that do a good job for them . " Writes Gates : " Steve is on a customer-satisfaction jihad . " So , on balance , has there been consumer harm ? Experts disagree . Gene DeRose , who runs Internet research firm Jupiter Communications , thinks Microsoft pressure has deterred PC companies from offering cutting-edge Internet appliances for consumers . He also thinks consumers were hurt when non-Internet companies hesitated to enter Internet businesses out of fear that Microsoft might try to take a toll on every transaction . But that problem diminished , he says , in the past three years as Microsoft was " rendered less bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photograph Ballmer 's making Microsoft nice . Says Gates : " He 's on a customer-satisfaction jihad. " // GeoPartners " Moore , on the other hand , is adamant that there has been no overall consumer harm . " The challenge for consumers is having software that 's easy to use , easy to integrate , and inexpensive , " he says . " Microsoft has done tremendous things integrating the software . It 's gotten vastly less expensive over time on a per feature basis . The one place Microsoft has n't evolved quickly is in ease of use . " Jim Allchin , the man who oversees Windows , pleads guilty to this last complaint . He insists that Windows ' complexity stems from making it compatible with many different kinds of hardware and applications , but adds , " And along with that compatibility has come , frankly , a core flaw , dealing with robustness and reliability . " He frequently gets lessons on how difficult Windows is from his 77-year-old mother : " I 'm humbled when she asks , " Why do I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And how can I respond to that ? It 's idiotic . " But Allchin says that such idiocies ( and there are many in Windows ) will soon change . " We make sure people here experience the pain , " he says , " so they want this product to get improved . " He 's almost fanatically upbeat about the fruit of his most recent labors , Windows 2000 , the much delayed revision of Windows NT , now due in February . Microsoft 's tactics have often been heavy-handed , maybe even on occasion illegal . Chances are , most of the facts are more or less as Judge Jackson suggests . But there may be larger facts he did n't consider . For example , without Microsoft 's evangelism , vision , and tenacity , the PC revolution would not have been nearly so rapid . And how could we have had a Web revolution-and all the social and economic benefits thereof-without all those PCs in place ? Does it really help consumers to knock down a company like this one ? // BUSINESS AT WORK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
