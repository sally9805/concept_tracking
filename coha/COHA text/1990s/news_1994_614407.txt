<p> We asked readers and columnists to share their dearest wish for Christmas . We got a sleighful of replies , from sixth-graders who long for peace and baseball to a daughter longing for a cure to disease . You 'll find excerpts from the wishes below and on pages H/02 and H/04 . <p> Magic that will last forever <p> For Christmas I want a 24-hour period when selfishness ceases to exist in the entire world . On that magical day , love and concern for others would fill the emotional void created by the removal of selfishness . <p> On that day , there would be no wars , murders , robberies , child abuse or religious persecution . The homeless would be fed ; the elderly and the ill would bask in love and kindness . There would be no unwanted children or dilapidated houses where drug-addicted teenagers shiver in the cold . <p> Emergency room personnel would enjoy a day of light work as no battered spouses or victims of drunk driving would require their services . Couples contemplating divorce would sit down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to heal conflict . <p> The sounds of heavy equipment would cease in the rain forests , and the manatees would swim without fear . <p> And best of all , all the politicians would vote themselves a pay decrease and eliminate taxes , because in a world where people care about each other , no one would have to fear hunger , old age , sickness , addiction or unemployment . <p> And , when the 24 hours are ended , maybe , just maybe , the world will have seen there 's a better credo than " me first . " And maybe some of the magic will last forever . <p> Keep kids safe <p> MILTON BOLTON , age 12 , East Point <p> I really wish that all guns in Georgia could be destroyed . Mostly because as long as I have been on Earth , there has been one murder or killing after another . One was my cousin Jimmy ; he was playing with a gun . That 's what Mom told me . Every time I see a gun or knife , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't had that gun , he would be with me now . He got shot in the chest . He thought the gun was n't loaded , but he was wrong . <p> To everyone who has a gun : Please , please do n't let this happen to any of your kids . <p> CHRISTMAS WISH LIST <p> Readers and columnists ask for everything from a better world to baseball . Here and on Page 4 , we share some of their wishes <p> For the young ones <p> MARIE B. LATTA , Tucker <p> My top wish for Christmas is safe , friendly neighborhoods for children . It is important to me personally because we have a granddaughter who has an inquisitive and caring spirit . I pray that she and all other children can grow and contribute without being dogged by the constant fear of violence , unexpected harm and the new breed of prejudice that threatens our society . We were not promised a world without conflict , but we have been given the capacity to make life- changing choices and give of ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tomorrow . <p> Like Aretha said . . . <p> HEATHER KENT , Snellville <p> My wish for Christmas is very plain , very simple . I believe it could be helpful in our society : <p> Respect ! <p> Toward tolerance <p> PHILLIP GUIN <p> All I want for Christmas is tolerance , so that acts of violence , thievery , murder and even war might never happen . I have been an educator for most of my professional life and I have seen the pain inflicted on my students by the lack of tolerance . On the other side of the coin I have seen , with the increase of tolerance in our educational system , the growth in our young . <p> Perhaps through tolerance we would go a long way toward the removal of the seven deadly sins : pride , avarice , lust , envy , gluttony , anger and sloth . We would learn the lesson of everyman that the only thing that matters is good deeds . <p> Guin teaches gifted students at Riverwood High School in Sandy Springs . <p> Babe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every heart could be filled with the divinely paradoxical spirit of the babe of Bethlehem this Christmas . <p> That spirit , which could be described as bleeding-heart liberal , reached out to the poor and destitute with hope , to the sick with healing , to the emotionally wounded with compassion , to those who were deemed to be of no account with equality , to the discouraged with encouragement , to the hungry with food , to the failures with success , to the socially undesirable with friendship , to the dying with life . <p> That spirit , which could be described as hard-core religious fanaticism , refused to yield to pressure from the established powers of the day , refused to dilute the truth , refused to compromise His message despite the consequences that eventually included His own death and that of many of his followers , refused to yield its integrity to anybody or anything , refused to be political , refused to avoid confrontation with those whose hearts were hardened and self-righteous , and plainly stated the consequences of not following Him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , express truth with love , and justice with forgiveness . <p> Celebrate humanity <p> KATHLEEN KENNEDY , Atlanta <p> Soon after human beings first appeared on this Earth , they began to mark the passing of the seasons with some sort of ritual or celebration . <p> My wish is that this age-old tradition be honored with more inclusive festivities rather than the divisive and relatively new ceremonies of Judeo-Christian construct . <p> How about having a celebration of peace and love for all of humankind and the world we live in ? <p> Restored hope <p> JAMES R. MESSENGER , Marietta <p> There is one great issue of our time - the loss of hope . People everywhere - poor , middle-class , sometimes even the rich - are increasingly feeling helpless about finding an opportunity to build a good , happy and prosperous life . <p> As the world proceeds through a great rebirth into a true new Information Age , enormous corporate downsizings and increased crime and violence are causing widespread loss of hope . These are clear signs that it is once again necessary for humankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to shape our civilization for the benefit of all . <p> It is my wish that humankind will see this watershed change as a great opportunity to create a new world . <p> Carter as umpire <p> RANDY HOYE , Atlanta <p> My Christmas wish concerns misusing a tremendous national resource - President Jimmy Carter . Rather than sending him off to Bosnia , why do n't you persuade the owners and players of Major League Baseball to allow him to negotiate a peaceful long-term settlement ? If he can help bring peace to the Middle East , surely he can negotiate a new agreement between baseball 's owners and players . <p> Inner peace <p> ELIZABETH WILLIAMS , Morrow <p> What I want most for Christmas for all , in every home in every town in every country : <p> For the gift of Christmas to be received . For Jesus , the Prince of Peace , to be accepted and honored . <p> We need nothing new for Christmas , only to let what has always been - God 's love - manifest itself throughout the lands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> No-whining zone <p> SUSAN BENTLEY , Atlanta <p> My Christmas wish is a moratorium on whining and lawsuits . What a great city we would have if everyone used their time to make themselves a better person and help others instead of fretting about whether or not their neighbor is sexist , racist , gay , pro-choice , pro-flag , praying or whatever . <p> I also would love to see the newspaper print one page of good news each day ! <p> Take responsibility <p> B.J. IVORS , Marietta <p> My Christmas wish is for a cure to the most overwhelming problem with society . Few people look inside themselves for the answers to their problems , and many of us want to blame others or the past for our problems . I want everyone to take responsibility for their actions and to realize the only person responsible for their destiny is themselves . <p> If kids were told more often the options they have and the consequences of them , they would start to think about their actions and the reactions they cause . <p> They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences in order to make decisions they can stand by . <p> Our successes can not be limited by our past , our family , our friends , our race or our income . <p> Our destiny is limited merely by the amount of restrictions we allow others to put on us or those we choose to put on ourselves . <p> No division <p> SARA BURCH , Rockmart <p> My first and only wish for this Christmas Day is that all mankind would for this one day lay aside all labels of manmade creeds and doctrine , myths , rituals , race , color , flags and nationalism that has ever divided and separated us . <p> The influence of such warring factions renders us unable to realize our oneness with all creation , our true brotherhood with all men . <p> Nothing in creation stands alone . <p> Furthermore , for just one day , I wish our global community could pledge allegiance to stand for and respect individual rights and the great human race , of which , by divine rights , we are all members - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARGARET PAINTER , Lithonia <p> I wish people the world over would realize that animals have feelings , too . Then maybe domestic animals would have caring and loving owners ; there would be no more " puppy mills " ; no more clubbing of baby seals or killing of dolphins and harpooning of whales ; elephants and rhino would n't be killed for their tusks and there would be no more illegal smuggling of rare breeds and parrots . <p> Until man learns to live in harmony with creatures of this planet , how can we hope for a better world for our grandchildren ? <p> So other families wo n't suffer , a cure for cancer <p> DENISE ROBINSON , Kennesaw <p> My mother battled breast cancer courageously for 16 months . <p> She suffered a great deal , and eventually it took her life this October . <p> We miss her smile , her laugh and her this Christmas . <p> My wish for Christmas would be for a cure for breast cancer to be found so that others wo n't have to suffer like she did and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wives , daughters , sisters , aunts and nieces . <p> Batter up <p> FRED SCHNEIDER , Lawrenceville <p> I want to hear a 19-year-old phenom 's fastball again . I want Willie and Mickey and the Duke . Hell , I want Tinker to Evers to Chance . I want a subway Series and for Cal Ripken Jr . to stop at 2130 - out of respect . For my father I want the Dodgers back in Brooklyn , in a bandshell stadium of creaky steps and hero strides . I want the DH rule shot like a dump rat . I want the seventh game of the 1973 World Series back and to relive 1986 forever . I want that farm in Iowa . <p> But what I want most is to have been able to hit the curveball . <p> No more war <p> VANESSA ZAPATA , age 13 , Marietta <p> My special wish for Christmas would be to help the people of Bosnia or to end the war going on there . <p> Pass it on <p> RUTH MUSHOCK , Lawrenceville <p> My Christmas wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from at least one person - one person who would make that child feel special and give him or her the confidence to be successful in life . <p> That child would then be capable of passing on that love to other people . <p> Then there would be respect for life . <p> One at a time <p> B. MacMURTRY , Roswell <p> This holiday , my wish is for every child born to be wanted , loved and nurtured . <p> I wish prospective parents would give as much thought to conceiving a baby as they do to purchasing electronics or acquiring a puppy , and I wish they would consider the money , physical strength and emotional maturity required to help a child grow and develop into a happy , stable , contributing adult . <p> When all children are truly wanted and properly cared for , we will have to worry very little about orphanages , high welfare costs , shelters for the abused , or detention centers . <p> Before cycle starts <p> LaTASHA PRAYOR , East Point <p> While dropping off my 4-year-old son at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 years of age walking down a busy street of Southwest Atlanta . <p> What struck me most about this kid was the toy gun he so proudly waved in the air , as if it were a trophy or a prize . <p> He would stop occasionally , point the gun at passing cars , cock it and pull the trigger . There was a certain darkness about this kid that truly scared me . In sadness , I realized that that child is our future . <p> My greatest fear is that my son 's childhood and the childhood of others will be forever scarred by our violent society . <p> I went home that day and tossed out all the toy guns purchased years earlier . I then sat down with my son and explained that guns are dangerous . " They 're not real , " he sighed . But we must start now teaching our preschoolers that their actions now - whether playing with toy guns or acting out violently - do carry over into adolescence and adulthood if ignored . <p> My Christmas wish is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , moral and emotional development of our children . It is not the responsibility of the school system or the government to teach values to our kids . <p> For Christmas , give us all the right to work , to play , to live without the fear of being shot to death by a violent 14-year-old or by an adult who was once a violent 14-year-old . End the cycle before it starts . <p> A classroom full of wishes <p> These wishes come from students in the sixth grade at Trinity School . <p> Happy home <p> DEVON McLURE , Atlanta <p> My wish for Christmas is for everyone in the world to have a home and presents and a happy Christmas . Sometimes we forget what is really important and that everyone does n't have what we do . <p> Young again <p> ALIX DAVIS , Smyrna <p> My Christmas wish is to have everyone have blissful youth back for one day , for everybody to be able to believe in Santa Claus and his magic for just one more day . Everyone is growing up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , at the ripe old age of 11 , miss my childhood when I could always crawl into my mother 's lap for protection . <p> No more guns <p> JACI THOMSON , Atlanta <p> What I wish for for Christmas is a permanent ban on guns . I know that seems impossible , but it fills my heart with sorrow every time an innocent child or adult is killed in a gun accident . I know deep down that God has intended them to go , but I pray that someday children can live without fear of death . No child deserves that much pain . <p> In the neighborhood <p> REBECCA MARGARET SKINNER , Atlanta <p> What I want is for everyone to be more cooperative . I 'm one of the oldest in my neighborhood and when I play with the little kids they fight about what to play . Everything would be so much easier if they could just take turns . <p> Play ball <p> MATHEW BEVILAQUA , Atlanta <p> I wish the baseball strike would end . I miss baseball . <p> Peace on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas there could be peace throughout the whole world . Fighting is such a horrible thing , and it 's hard to stop . The United States is very lucky ; we have no fighting . But other people in the world are n't so lucky . I wish so much that peace could be throughout the lands , especially on Christmas ! <p> Bowwows of jolly <p> PEYTEN DOBBS , Atlanta <p> I want all the dogs and cats that are on the street and starving to have a good home for the holidays or just a bowl of food . They need a happy holiday , too . <p> Family care <p> McQUEEN CALVERT , Atlanta <p> I would wish for everybody to be happy and have a family that cared for them , especially during Christmastime . <p> I have that , and if anybody does n't , I hope they find one soon . <p> Clean team <p> ALLISON COBB , Atlanta <p> My Christmas wish is for all of Atlanta to be cleaned up . Right now , Atlanta looks very messy in some parts because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough about our city , we could make it happen .
