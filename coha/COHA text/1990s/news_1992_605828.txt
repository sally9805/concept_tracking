<p> Judy Putnam knows what you 've been eating . She knows that you love pizza more than ever . That you 've switched to low-fat or skim milk , but you 're still guzzling those soft drinks . That you 're eating more fresh fruit , less beef but you ca n't pass up sweets . <p> She even knows that you 're eating more prunes than usual , but she 's too polite to inquire why . <p> How does she know all this ? <p> For 25 years , Putnam has been a U.S. Department of Agriculture researcher , first tracking Americans ' attitudes about their diet and now keeping an eye on what the country is actually consuming . <p> From her downtown cubicle at the USDA Economic Research Service , Putnam and her trusty computer have just released figures that show how food consumption in the United States has changed dramatically in the last 20 years . Her report contains some news that will make nutrition experts happy and some that will make them pull their hair in frustration . Either way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , I 've been looking at how people are changing their diets for health reasons . In areas where we can eat more , we do well . Where we have to cut back , we have problems , " she says . <p> She means that nutritionists have urged us to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables  --  and that we 've done it . As for sugars and fats , which we 're constantly being warned to reduce , no one 's paying a whole lot of attention , judging by her latest data . <p> But before we get to the specific figures , Putnam makes a few cautionary comments . <p> " These figures are only estimates , " she stresses , smoothing the cover of her newest report before she hands it over . The way the USDA comes up with the numbers is to take a commodity  --  corn , for example  --  and figure out how much of it is produced . Subtracted from this number is the amount that goes into industrial uses , farm animal feed and exports . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . <p> This is not always exactly accurate , Putnam notes . The amount of poultry that Americans supposedly eat , for instance , also includes the amount of chicken and turkey parts that are going into their pets ' food . And the figures for fats and oils includes the ever-increasing amount of oil being used by restaurants for frying up our favorite burgers , nuggets and french fries . We 're not actually consuming all that oil , although it is being used to feed our demand for fried fast food . <p> Still , these are the most accurate figures available for tracking the trends in what Americans are eating . <p> What Putnam has found in looking at data spanning 1970 to 1990 is that Americans are consuming more food per capita than ever . " If we keep this up , we 're going to be blimps by the year 2000 , " she says with a laugh . <p> She 's also found that our diets have shifted away from having meat or animal products as the main dish and instead we 're mixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , we 're eating more breakfast cereal instead of breakfast meats , and passing up a steak or plain chicken for stir-fried meat and vegetables over rice , pasta entrees , pizza , tacos , enchiladas and fajitas . <p> In fact , our consumption of plant-based foods has far outpaced animal products , especially in the last five years . In the 1970s , meat , chicken , pork and eggs made up the bulk of our diets . By the end of the decade , crop-based foods like cereals , flour , fruits , vegetables , nuts and vegetable oil had begun to rise and since 1984 , they have dominated what we eat . USDA figures show that per-capita consumption of crop products soared 16 percent in the past 20 years , while consumption of animal products rose less than 1 percent . <p> This is good news , says Judy Dodd , president of the American Dietetic Association . " I 'm glad to hear we 're eating more crop-based foods . Good nutrition is based on a mixture . For years I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Going along with this general trend is the fact that Americans cut back on high-fat food sources such as red meat , eggs , whole milk , butter and lard in 1990 , and ate more low-fat foods like poultry , fish and shellfish , fresh fruits and vegetables , grains and low-fat milk products . <p> " A lot of big changes have occurred in the last five to 10 years , " explains Putnam , " especially in grains and fruits and vegetables . " The year 1985 , in particular , saw a big jump in produce consumption because of major research reports by cancer institutions about the importance of the vitamins in fruits and vegetables in helping to prevent cancer . <p> However , before we pat ourselves on the back too much , Putnam also has some bad news . <p> First of all , Americans do n't just have a sweet tooth , it 's more like a whole set of molars . Despite the growing popularity of low-calorie sweeteners , Americans refuse to give up their sugar . Consumption of all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970 and 1990 . Our use of corn sweeteners nearly quadrupled during the same period  --  most of it due to the skyrocketing use of soft drinks . <p> Although corn syrup has replaced sugar in soft drinks , refined sugar still has increased by four pounds per person since 1986 because of our love of bakery treats and sweet cereals . In fact , the bakery and cereal industry has become the largest industrial user of sugar . It alone accounts for 20 percent of total sugar use for food and beverages , up from 14 percent in 1980 . <p> And then there 's the subject of how much fat we 're eating . <p> " Americans did n't quite get the message , " observes Judith Solberg , public health nutrition director with the Iowa department of public health . " They knew they were supposed to decrease their saturated fat , so they just started using more vegetable oil . They do n't understand that they need to decrease the entire amount of fat in their diet . " <p> Indeed , Americans have cut back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk and red meat , because of what Dr. C. Wayne Callaway at George Washington University calls " the cholesterol witch hunt " that tried to pin all the blame for heart disease on this one factor . <p> Unfortunately , Americans have replaced the animal fat with vegetable fat , consuming much more vegetable fat and oil in the form of fried foods and salad dressings . They 're also increasing their use of cream , sour cream and cheese , which are generally higher in fat . <p> Even with our cutbacks in animal fats , Putnam says the amount of calories we get from fat in our daily diets has been steadily increasing . At the turn of the century , " we got 32 percent of our calories from fat , " just about what the American Heart Association recommends . " Today it 's at 43 percent , " Putnam notes , despite the constant barrage of messages about cutting back on fat . <p> " We know we should n't eat fat , but we 're not sure what to eat instead , " Putnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fat in our diet comes from meat and dairy , but another third comes from nonessential food like snacks , " says the endocrinologist , who is involved in dietary research and education programs . <p> He favors teaching people how to balance their diet over time , rather than concentrating on " good " and " bad " foods or telling people to eliminate an entire food category , like meat . <p> Bonnie Liebman , director of nutrition for the consumer group Center for Science in the Public Interest , is harsher in her evaluation of American habits . <p> Although she says most of the current trends are going in the right direction , she cautions that " it 's too early to sit back and relax just because the average person is eating a few more fruits and vegetables . " <p> She would like to see Americans replace even more animal foods , like chicken and beef , with plant foods . " We should be eating main dishes that consist of vegetables , grains and legumes . " <p> As the ' 90s begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption habits may change . She is hopeful , however , that the new food labeling regulations will help people to realize the hidden fats and sugars in many products . " It 's incredible how much lack of information there is out there , " she says . <p> Nibble on This <p> Here are some interesting tidbits from the most recent USDA figures on American consumption : <p> Say cheese  --  Cheese consumption is on the rise , undoubtedly due to our love for pizza . In 1990 , each American consumed nearly 25 pounds of cheese . The biggest increase was from Italian cheeses , particularly mozzarella . <p> Playing chicken  --  Per-capita consumption of poultry products has increased steadily since the 1970s , reaching 64 pounds by 1990 . By weight , chicken consumption has increased the most in the last 20 years , equaling 21 pounds consumed per person in 1990 . But on a percentage basis , turkey has risen faster , more than doubling during the past 20 years to 14 pounds per person . <p> There 's no egg on our faces  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1970 to 187 in 1990 . <p> No tears over spilt milk  --  On a per capita basis , Americans went from consuming 214 pounds of whole milk in 1970 to only 88 pounds in 1990 . Skim milk increased from 12 to 23 pounds , and low-fat shot up from 30 to 98 pounds in 20 years . <p> No forbidden fruits  --  Per capita consumption of fresh fruits rose 18 pounds from 1970 to a total of 90 pounds in 1990 . This stemmed entirely from the increasing popularity of fresh noncitrus fruits , particularly bananas , apples , grapes , pears and strawberries . <p> Caffeine high  --  We 're drinking less coffee ( down from 35 gallons per capita to 27 ) , but we 're still getting our caffeine from an increased consumption of chocolate and soft drinks . <p> Have a drink  --  Soft drinks seem to be the national beverage . Each American consumed nearly 43 gallons in 1990 , nearly double the amount recorded in 1970 . Compare this to apple juice ( 2 gallons ) , citrus juices ( 4 gallons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 gallons ) . The only other beverage that came close was beer at nearly 35 gallons , up slightly from 31 gallons in 1970.
