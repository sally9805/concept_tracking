Requiem for a Pr THE WAVES TURNED VICIOUS and worsened with every rush of wind . The calm weather of the morning transformed from Dr. Jekyll into a vehement Mr. Hyde by late evening . Whitecaps on the crests of towering waves were lashed into sheets of spray . The violent water and black clouds merged under the onslaught of a driving snowstorm . It was impossible to tell where water ended and sky began . As the passenger liner Princess Dou Wan fought through waves that rose like mountains before spilling over the ship , the men on board were unaware of the imminent disaster that was only minutes away . The crazed waters were driven by northeast and northwest gales that simultaneously caused ferocious currents to smash against the ship from two sides . Winds soon reached a hundred miles an hour with waves that crested at thirty feet or more . Caught in the maelstrom , the Princess Dou Wan had no place to hide . Her bow pitched and drove under waves that swept over her open decks and flowed aft and then forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of the water . Struck from all directions , she rolled thirty degrees , her starboard rail along the promenade deck disappearing in a torrent of water . Slowly , too slowly , she sluggishly righted herself and plunged on , steaming through the worst storm in recent history . Freezing and unable to see through the blinding snowstorm , Second Mate Li Po , who stood watch , ducked back inside the wheelhouse and slammed the door . In all his days of sailing the China Sea , he had never seen swirling snow in the middle of a violent storm . Po did not think the gods were fair to hurl such devastating winds at the Princess after a voyage halfway around the world with less than two hundred miles to go before reaching port . In the past sixteen hours , she had only made forty miles . Except for Captain Leigh Hunt and his chief engineer down below in the engine room , the entire crew were Nationalist Chinese . An old salt with twelve years in the Royal Navy and eighteen as an officer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those years as captain . As a boy he went fishing with his father out of Bridlington , a small city on the east coast of England , before shipping out as an ordinary seaman on a freighter to South Africa . A thin man with graying hair and sad , vacant eyes , he was deeply pessimistic about his ship 's ability to weather the storm . Two days earlier , one of the crewmen had called his attention to a crack in the starboard outer hull aft of the single smokestack . He would have given a month 's pay to inspect the crack now that his ship was enduring incredible stress . He reluctantly brushed the thought aside . It would have been suicide to attempt an inspection under hundred-mile-an-hour winds and the raging water that spilled across the decks . He felt in his bones the Princess was in mortal danger , and accepted the fact that her fate was out of his hands . Hunt stared into the blanket of snow that pelted the wheelhouse windows and spoke to his second mate without turning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Building rapidly , Captain . " " Do you believe we 're in danger of capsizing ? " Li Po shook his head slowly . " Not yet , sir , but by morning the load on the superstructure and decks could prove critical if we take on a heavy list . " Hunt thought for a moment , then spoke to the helmsman . " Stay on course , Mr. Tsung . Keep our bow into the wind and waves . " " Aye , sir , " the Chinese helmsman replied , feet braced wide apart , hands tightly gripping the brass wheel . Hunt 's thoughts returned to the crack in the hull . He could n't remember when the Princess Dou Wan had a proper marine inspection in dry dock . Strangely , the crew 's uneasiness about leaks , badly rusted hull plates , and weakened and missing rivets was totally lacking . They appeared to ignore the corrosion and the constantly running bilge pumps that strained to carry off the heavy leakage during the voyage . If the Princess had an Achilles ' heel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship that sails the oceans is considered old after twenty years . She had traveled hundreds of thousands of miles scathed by rough seas and typhoons during her thirty-five years since leaving the shipyards . It was little short of a miracle that she was still afloat . Launched in 1913 as the Lanai by shipbuilders Harland and Wolff for Singapore Pacific Steamship Lines , her tonnage grossed out at 10,758 . Her overall length was 497 feet from straight-up-and-down stem to champagne glass-shaped stern with a sixty-foot beam . Her triple-expansion steam engines put out five thousand horsepower and turned twin screws . In her prime she could cut the waves at a respectable seventeen knots . She went into service between Singapore and Honolulu until 1931 , when she was sold to the Canton Lines and renamed Princess Dou Wan . After a refit , she was employed running passengers and cargo throughout Southeast Asian ports . During World War II , she was taken over and fitted out by the Australian government as a troop transport . Heavily damaged after surviving attacks by Japanese aircraft during convoy duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and served briefly on short runs from Shanghai to Hong Kong , until the spring of 1948 , when she was to be sold to the scrappers in Singapore . Her accommodations were designed to carry fifty-five first-class passengers , eighty-five secondclass , and 370 third-class . Normally she carried a crew of 190 , but on what was to be her final voyage , she was manned by only thirty-eight . Hunt thought of his ancient command as a tiny island on a turbulent sea engulfed in a drama without an audience . His attitude was fatalistic . He was ready for the beach and the Princess was ready for the scrap yard . Hunt felt compassion for his battle-scarred ship as she wrestled with the full brunt of the storm . She twisted and groaned when inundated by the titanic waves , but she always broke free and punched her bow into the next one . Hunt 's only consolation was that her worn-out engines never missed a beat . Down in the engine room the creaking and groaning of the hull were uncommonly clamorous . Rust danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the walkway gratings . Rivets holding the steel plates were sheering off . They popped out of the plates and shot through the air like missiles . Usually , the crew was apathetic . It was a common occurrence on ships built before the days of welding . But there was one man who was touched by the tentacles of fear . Chief Engineer Ian " Hong Kong " Gallagher was an ox-shouldered , red-faced , hard-drinking , heavily mustached Irishman who knew a ship in the throes of breaking up when he saw and heard one . Yet fear was pushed from his mind as he calmly turned his thoughts to survival . An orphan at the age of eleven , Ian Gallagher ran away from the slums of Belfast and went to sea as a cabin boy . Nurturing a natural talent for maintaining steam engines , he became a wiper and then a third assistant engineer . By the time he was twenty-seven , he had his papers as chief engineer and served on tramp freighters plying the waters between the islands of the South Pacific . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought an epic battle in one of the port city 's saloons against eight Chinese dockworkers who tried to roll him . When he turned thirty , he signed on board the Princess Dou Wan in the summer of 1945 . Grim-faced , Gallagher turned to his second engineer , Chu Wen . " Get topside , put on a life vest and be ready to abandon ship when the captain gives the order . " The Chinese engineer pulled the stub of a cigar from his mouth and stared at Gallagher appraisingly . " You think we 're going down ? " " I know we 're going down , " Gallagher replied firmly . " This old rust bucket wo n't last another hour . " " Did you tell the captain ? " " He 'd have to be deaf , dumb and blind not to figure it out himself . " " You coming ? " asked Chu Wen . " I 'll be right behind you , " answered Gallagher . Chu Wen wiped his oily hands on a rag , nodded at the chief engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to the upper decks . Gallagher took one final look at his beloved engines , certain they would soon be lying in the deep . He stiffened as an unusually loud screech echoed throughout the hull . The aged Princess Dou Wan was tormented by metal fatigue , a scourge suffered by aircraft as well as ships . Extremely difficult to distinguish in calm waters , it only becomes evident in a vessel pounded by vicious seas . Even when new , the Princess would have been hard-pressed to bear up under the onslaught of the waves that pounded her hull with a force of twenty thousand pounds per square inch . Gallagher 's heart froze when he saw a crack appear in a bulkhead that spread downward and then sideways across the hull plates . Starting on the port side , it widened as it progressed to starboard . He snatched up the ship 's phone and rang the bridge . Li Po answered . " Bridge . " " Put the captain on ! " Gallagher snapped . A second 's pause , and then , " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a hell of a crack in the engine room , and it 's getting worse by the minute . " Hunt was stunned . He had hoped against hope that they could make port before the damage turned critical . " Are we taking on water ? " " The pumps are fighting a losing battle . " " Thank you , Mr. Gallagher . Can you keep the engines turning until we reach land ? " " What time frame do you have in mind ? " " Another hour should put us in calmer waters . " " Doubtful , " said Gallagher . " I give her ten minutes , no more . " " Thank you , Chief , " Hunt said heavily . " You 'd better leave the engine room while you still can . " Hunt wearily replaced the receiver , turned and looked out the aft wheelhouse windows . The ship had taken on a noticeable list and was rolling heavily . Two of her boats had already been smashed and swept overboard . Making for the nearest shore and running the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To reach the smoother waters , he would have to make a turn to starboard . The Princess would never survive if she was caught broadside in the maddened waves . She could easily be plunged into a trough without any hope of getting out . Whatever the circumstance , breaking up or the ice building on her superstructure and capsizing her , the ship was doomed . His mind briefly traveled back sixty days in time and ten thousand miles in distance to the dock on the Yangtze River at Shanghai , where the furnishings from the Princess Dou Wan 's staterooms were being stripped in preparation for her final voyage to the scrap yard in Singapore . The departure had been interrupted when General Kung Hui of the Nationalist Chinese Army arrived on the dock in a Packard limousine and ordered Captain Hunt to converse with him inside the car . " Please excuse my intrusion , Captain , but I am acting under the personal directive of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek . " General Kung Hui , skin and hands as smooth and white as a sheet of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed no sign of a crease . He took up the entire rear seat in the passengers ' compartment as he spoke , while Captain Hunt was forced to sit uncomfortably twisted sideways on a jump seat . " You are hearby ordered to place your ship and crew in a state of readiness for a long voyage . " " I believe there has been a mistake , " said Hunt . " The Princess is not in a state of readiness for an extended cruise . She is about to depart with barely enough men , fuel and supplies to make the scrap yard in Singapore . " " You can forget about Singapore , " said Hui with an airy wave of one hand . " Ample fuel and food will be provided along with twenty men from our Nationalist Navy . Once your cargo is on board . . . " Hui paused to insert a cigarette in a long holder and light it . " . . . I should say in about ten days , you will be given your sailing orders . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued Hunt . " The directors of Canton Lines have been notified the Princess Dou Wan will be temporarily appropriated by the government . " " They agreed to it ? " Hui nodded . " Considering they were generously offered payment in gold by the generalissimo , they were most happy to cooperate . " " After we reach our , or should I say , your destination , what then ? " " Once the cargo is safely delivered ashore , you may continue on to Singapore . " " May I ask where we 're bound for ? " " You may not . " " And the cargo ? " " Secrecy will dominate the entire mission . From this minute on , you and your crew will remain on board your ship . No one steps ashore . You will have no contact with friends or family . My men will guard the ship day and night to guarantee strict security . " " I see , " said Hunt , but obviously he did n't . He could not recall seeing such shifty eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your communications equipment is being either removed or destroyed . " Hunt was stunned . " Surely you ca n't expect me to attempt a voyage at sea without a radio . What if we encounter difficulties and have to send out a call for assistance ? " Hui idly held up his cigarette holder and studied it . " I foresee no difficulties . " " You are an optimist , General , " said Hunt slowly . " The Princess is a tired ship far beyond her prime . She is ill-prepared to cope with heavy seas and violent storms . " " I can not impress upon you the importance and great rewards if this mission is carried out successfully . Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek will generously compensate you and your crew in gold after you successfully reach port . " Hunt stared out the window of the limousine at the rusting hull of his ship . " A fortune in gold wo n't do me much good when I 'm lying on the bottom of the sea . " " Then we will rest together for eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be coming along as your passenger .
