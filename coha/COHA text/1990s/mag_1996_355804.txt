When Lorenzo Carcaterra published Sleepers last year , he said his book  --  about brutal child abuse in a New York reform school in the 1960s and the long-delayed but satisfying revenge four of the victims gain on their tormentors  --  was a true and , indeed , autobiographical tale . His story , however , did not check out to the satisfaction of investigating journalists , who could find no hard evidence to support his claim . The author 's defense was that he had changed names and details to protect his pals . <P> Undeterred by the minor literary scandal that ensued and obviously a sucker for a rattling good ( if wildly improbable ) yarn , writer-director Barry Levinson proceeded with his screen adaptation of the story . In doing what a filmmaker must do  --  strip a book to its narrative essence  --  he has perhaps resolved whatever controversy may still cling to Carcaterra 's work . We now see clearly that the author 's primary source was n't life but movies . <P> Lots of movies , it turns out . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Hell 's Kitchen . They talk tough , engage in petty crime and swim in the river like the Dead End Kids of yore . They play basketball under the tutelage of a kindly priest , just like the gang in Angels with Dirty Faces , only with Robert De Niro playing the Pat O'Brien part . <P> When one of their pranks misfires , the four are sent to the Wilkinson Home for Boys , and we hear the doors of a new genre , the prison picture , clang shut . A group of guards led by Sean Nokes ( Kevin Bacon at his slimiest ) subject them to beatings and gang rapes . These ordeals are discreetly handled by Levinson , who makes us fully aware of their horrors without becoming graphically realistic . <P> A decade later , the two boys most damaged by the torture  --  they 've become cold professional killers , played by Billy Crudup and Ron Eldard  --  encounter Nokes in a bar , blow him away and blow us into yet another fictive mode , the improbable legal thriller . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone straight : Michael ( Brad Pitt ) is an assistant D.A . assigned to prosecute the case , while Carcaterra , nicknamed Shakes ( Jason Patric ) , is an aspiring newspaperman . Michael intends not only to lose the case against his old pals but also to use it to wreak vengeance on Nokes ' former accomplices , all of whom have gone on to respectable lives . Shakes ' job is to persuade their priestly mentor to supply an alibi for the murderers by lying on the witness stand . This offers amusingly gainful employment for Dustin Hoffman as a bumbling defense lawyer . It is all legally preposterous . But Levinson is a slick craftsman , his actors are insinuatingly real , and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus casts a disarmingly believable light on these proceedings . At some low , what's-next level , Sleepers works like , well , gangbusters . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
