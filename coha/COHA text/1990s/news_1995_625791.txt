<p> Quit labeling , dividing <p> I am offended by a statement that Donald Kaul made in his Dec. 7 column , " " Liberal-bashing has gone beyond reason . " <p> Kaul referred to people who bash liberals as " " people who care for nothing but feeding the rich . " <p> As I checked the archives of notes hanging on my refrigerator I came up with a list of priorities that I wrote down over three years ago . <p> I have bashed a few liberals in my time , but I could n't find any reference to feeding the rich . <p> Take a look at the personal priorities of one conservative : Reduce the national debt . <p> Balance the federal budget - no new spending . <p> Have no socialized medicine . Motivate industry to discover more cures and preventions . <p> Get tough on crime - capital punishment , less parole , more prisons without luxuries . <p> Maintain a strong defense but cut excessive spending ( fat ) . <p> Make abortions very difficult to get . <p> Have equal pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Education should be under local control and track and challenge the best students . <p> Save our air , forests and water but not our habitats . <p> Privatize the post office and Social Security and give us more free market choices . <p> Review pensions of public officials . <p> Secure our borders from illegal immigration . <p> If I made a new list today it would be somewhat different but it would not include " " feeding the rich . " <p> Let 's quit labeling , lumping and dividing . It may make for interesting columns , but it does n't help a country made up of millions of individuals who think independently , like I do . <p> Sally C.Roberts , Kingwood <p> Restoring balance to system <p> Regarding Tony Rider 's Dec. 5 letter , " " Where are they now ? " : <p> No need to ask where we are . We tort-reform advocates are still around , ready to refresh the memories of those who would try to rewrite what was said and done during the recent lawsuit reform efforts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restore balance , fairness and equity to the civil justice system . <p> We believe both defendants and plaintiffs are entitled to a level playing field , not a field that is tilted in favor of the plaintiff . <p> Secondarily , we explained how tort reform would eventually bring down the prices of almost every consumer product and service , including medical costs and even insurance rates . <p> Even before many of the laws have taken effect , prices are beginning to reflect the improved civil justice environment . <p> New investments are being made and jobs created because companies are no longer as afraid to do business in our state . <p> The state insurance commissioner recently announced a $ 263 million rollback in regulated insurance rates . <p> Most importantly , though , defendants in lawsuits now have a better chance to see that their case is decided on true guilt or innocence , rather than on who is best able to exploit the rules of a rigged civil justice system . <p> Larry N.Forehand , Houston <p> Face the fact , Texas In his Dec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Richard N. Neal claimed that the federal government , which furnishes most of the money for highway construction in Texas , has no business dictating speed limits in this state . <p> By that logic , the Texas Department of Human Services - which furnishes food stamps - has no business dictating that they not be expended on alcohol or tobacco . <p> Texans should face an uncomfortable , but well-documented fact : It is precisely those states whose citizens most value rugged individualism which receive the lion 's share of federal largess . <p> Curtis Bean , Houston <p> Still not trustworthy <p> Yes , U.S.Rep . Steve Stockman , R-Friendswood , says he was late with a payment on his government-backed student loan because , in the heat of a campaign , he forgot to ask his wife , " " Honey , did we pay that bill ? " Possibly true . <p> But what about his lie during the 1990 Republican primary , when he first ran for Congress ? He claimed then that he had already received his degree from the University of Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lena Guerrero , he had not yet finished his work to receive the degree . <p> Did he forget , in the heat of the campaign , to ask his wife , " " Honey , have I graduated yet ? " <p> I think he just lied - and I see no change in him that makes him trustworthy now . <p> David Jameson , Galveston <p> Let 's rebuild our nation <p> We now stand on the threshold of becoming just another nation facing " " Balkanization " with all this multicultural , bilingual tripe being pushed upon us by some of the sorriest , jelly-backboned politicians whose main interest is to get re-elected . <p> I can think of no better reason than this to bring in term limits , a third major political party , cutting back on political salaries , perks and pensions . Since the ' 70s , the working American ( taxpayer ) has been having to take cuts in salaries , health and welfare benefits , retirement benefits , job security , speed-ups in job performances , etc <p> So the time has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share of the lumps . <p> Let 's all stop whining , tighten up our belts , start rebuilding our nation and tell other nations that they will have to wait until we have our house in order . <p> Luther LeBlanc , Houston <p> GT , phone home <p> I do n't understand what all of the bother and worry is about raising the speed limit . <p> The only cars that I see on Houston 's freeways that are driving the speed limit or below it are those that have drivers using cellular phones . <p> John H. Hall Jr. , Shenandoah <p> This was one weird year <p> We must be traveling through some black hole or a time warp . <p> Otherwise , how do we explain the wacky world we live in ? <p> Look at what has happened this year : Republicans in control of Congress and Texas , the Oilers leaving Houston for Nashville , NFL teams abandoning their fans , the Southwest Conference broken up , the concealed handgun law , the speed limit change , no respect for the Rockets in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the track . <p> Here is hoping that 1996 will be better . 1995 was weird . <p> Ysidro Astorga Jr. , Houston <p> A just and noble cause <p> I 'm proud of President Clinton for exerting his power in a most positive and humanitarian way in Bosnia . I 'm also proud of our troops who will be contributing to the cause of peace and for bringing hope to a war-torn people . <p> That a majority of Americans ca n't see this peaceful act as a just and noble cause , makes me feel ashamed . <p> E. Burke , Houston <p> A message for parents <p> Thank you for printing Glenn Spraker 's Dec. 4 letter , " " Stop making excuses . " <p> He and other good teachers are going to have to fight this wave of irresponsible liberal rhetoric that blames schools for everything . <p> Parents should send their children to school with clean minds , bodies and souls , and leave the teachers alone to do their good jobs . Then stand back with
