Just now Miriam , your wife  --  no , your widow  --  walked through you . She was vacuuming the hall carpet , and she went back and forth through the spot where you died . <p> You do n't feel the cold , though January frost is on the ground outside . Come the summer , you wo n't feel the warmth either . By then Miriam will be gone , though you 'll still be here . <p> Eat sensibly , they said . Take plenty of exercise . But everybody has 20/ 20 hindsight . When you felt the chest pains , you knew your time had come . A little part of you welcomed the inevitable . You were forty-five years old . <p> Is your soul forty-five ? Or is it timeless ? Maybe the latter , though there 's no way of telling . You speak to no one , and you have to answer your own questions . <p> Tick tick tick . The bleep of digital watches . Time is a treadmill . And now you 're off it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , the leaves brown and fall , the ground is covered in white that melts to gray , but it 's just a spectacle to you . You do n't feel time 's throb in your blood . You 've shed the past and you have no future . A continuous present tense . <p> Miriam is on the phone to John , the elder of your two children . <p> " I do n't know , " she 's saying . " I did tell him to look after himself . But he would n't listen . . . . Yes , I suppose you could call him pigheaded . I 'd rather put it that he knew his own mind Well , it 's too late to do anything about it now . " <p> The now is elongated , louder than the rest of the sentence . You watch as her face creases and she covers it with her hand . Her shoulders shake with dry sobs . Her eyes are red from crying . <p> This is your world . <p> You wander from the hallway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back . In another direction is the front room . <p> You ca n't leave the house . You 're at your strongest in the hallway , where you died . If you roam the house , day or night ( you do n't sleep ) you sense some loss of energy the further you move away from that spot . But you ca n't go out the back door . It 's as if your house , your home , the network of associations it has amassed from your twenty years living inside it , holds you together . As if you 're imprinted on it . You ca n't leave it : you 've tried . Outside you 'd simply disperse , scatter like ashes on the wind . <p> From the hallway you go upstairs onto the landing . Straight ahead is the bathroom . To your right is John 's old room , then Georgina 's , your daughter who 's only recently left home . You were going to redecorate her room . Then there 's the room you shared with Miriam for twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undressing for bed . You watch her put her clothes away , folding them with the instinctive neatness you used to envy . The woman you loved for twenty years or more is naked in front of you , and you feel nothing . You watch her pull a nightdress on over her head , smooth it down over her hips . She climbs into bed , puts on her glasses to read . But she ca n't concentrate , it seems , so she puts the book away and turns out the light . <p> Miriam answers the doorbell . On the step is Georgina in a pale orange padded coat , a scarf wrapped around her neck . When she speaks , her breath is visible ; her cheeks are red . " Hi , Mum ! " she says , and they embrace . On Georgina 's right is a taller woman with long dark hair ; she flashes a nervous smile . <p> " Mum , this is Sue , " says Georgina . <p> " Oh yes , " says Miriam . " Your ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgina laughs . <p> Miriam invites them inside and takes their coats . Georgina has had her mouse-brown hair permed since you last saw her . You often wondered at her lack of boyfriends in the past , but did n't presume to ask her : she 's always been attractive if a bit on the short side ) and looks especially good in leggings , which she 's wearing at this moment . Now you know . <p> Later in the evening , Georgina says : " You remember when I told you I was a lesbian ? Five years ago it was , now . Time flies . " She and Sue are holding hands . <p> " How can I forget ? It came as a total surprise . " <p> " Did you ever tell Dad ? " <p> " No , I did n't . I always said it was for you to do that . " <p> " I never did . I was always meaning to . It 's too late now . I  --  I ... I know this sounds silly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Were you scared of him ? " <p> A long pause . " I suppose you could say that . " <p> " You should n't have been . He always thought very highly of you . In fact , he often asked me why he never saw you with a boyfriend . " <p> " Well , he never bloody asked me ! " Georgina 's face is flushed ; she gesticulates wildly with her cigarette in her right hand . " I 'd have told him why if he 'd asked ! I 've known since I was bloody ten ! " <p> Sue looks on , not wanting to take part in this family altercation . <p> " You should have told him , Georgina , " says Miriam . <p> Georgina is crying now . " It 's not my bloody fault ! It 's his , for being so bloody distant ! " She coughs , dabs at her eyes with her handkerchief . " I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I should n't have said that . " <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sue , sleeping in your bed . Miriam has given it to them : they need the space , not her . <p> Miriam is in Georgina 's old single bed . <p> Georgina lies on her side and so does Sue , facing the same direction , molding her body round Georgina 's . <p> You do feel something . <p> You feel pain . <p> I 'm sorry , Georgina , you want to ) say . <p> But there 's no one to hear those words , asleep or awake . <p> The next morning John and his wife Donna arrive . Today is your funeral . Another family occasion . The last one was John and Donna 's wedding . Donna 's dress is rounded out at the abdomen . You were told you were to be a grandfather . You felt the pride you 'd felt when he helped you from an early age in the garden or with the car ; that pride when he grew up tall and strong , when he started to bring girlfriends home . You remember the evening when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ) to find John and a girlfriend kissing and embracing on the front room settee , clothes loosened , oblivious . You smiled and closed the door , leaving them be . All that is in the past . <p> But now you 'll never see your grandchild . <p> Miriam , John , Donna , and Georgina kiss and embrace . John is pale and drawn ; Donna , on the other hand , is blithe , the only one capable of smiling . Although she was always friendly to you ( you always found her attractive , from the time when John first introduced her to you ) , she is perhaps most distant from today 's event and with her pregnancy is . otherwise preoccupied . Or simply putting on a brave face . <p> John and Donna shake Sue 's hand . Perhaps it was n't wise for Georgina to bring her ; she 's out of place . But maybe their entwined roots go deeper , and her function here is to give Georgina support . And the time she does that is when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then goes to change into her funeral dress , black with a veil . She climbs into the front passenger scat of John 's car , Donna , Georgina and Sue crowding into the back . John starts the car . <p> The house is empty . <p> You are alone . <p> You do not know what will happen . <p> Have you been fated to last as long as the funeral ? Will the action of putting your body in the ground , food for worms , put your soul at rest ? You look at the lounge clock . They must be burying you about now . But you feel no dissolution of energy . Or will you just simply vanish , to go  --  where ? And where are the other dead ? <p> You do n't know . <p> After the funeral , Miriam hosts your wake . In this room are people you have n't seen for years , distant relatives , old friends , some of them dating from your school days . How they 've changed : put on weight , acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases , grandparents . You listen to the conversation . How sudden , how unexpected , what a sad day . But further away , out of the earshot of your immediate family , darker notes are sounded : how you brought it upon yourself , did n't look after yourself , asking for a heart attack . They talk about Georgina too : how could she bring her lesbian lover try an occasion like this ? Another comes to her defense : her father was very strict , took the news of her lesbianism very hard . <p> It 's not true ! you want to shout . I did n't know about it ! <p> You want to cry , but no tears come . It 's like you 're watching a film ; you ca n't change what you see . I did n't know . I tried my best . You ca n't ask more than that . No one can . <p> In the center of the room , Miriam stands next to John , talking to her sister Andrea . <p> " So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm going to stay with John and Donna for a while . They might need my help , what with the baby and everything . " John puts his arm about her shoulder . " This place I 'm going to sell , find something smaller . This is too big for me , and there are too many ... memories . " <p> A for sale sign has appeared in the garden . John is helping Miriam pack her belongings into his car . Many items will be sold , as she wo n't have room for them in her new home ; she 's left a forwarding address by the telephone . <p> Finally Miriam is ready to go . The last suitcase is packed ; the last box has been filled . <p> " Have you got everything , Mum ? " says John . <p> " Yes , I think so . " There 's a slight quaver in her voice . <p> " Just one final look round ? " Miriam blinks . " Yes . " <p> You follow her as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done a thorough job : the house is bare . Nothing has been left behind . <p> Except for you . <p> As she stands on the doorstep , ready to leave , you reach out and touch her on the shoulder . <p> She looks up . Did she feel your touch ? She mouths two words . And then she is gone . You hear the car turning on the gravel . <p> Like a radioactive isotope , you have a half-life . Eventually you will decay and die a second time . <p> Good-bye , she said . And then she said your name . <p> For Valerie Thame , with thanks <p> <p> By Gary Couzens <p> Gary Couzens read English a t Southampton University and now works for British Telecom . He has sold stories and fiction to various British magazines , but his only U.S. appearances have been in F &SF; <p> He returns with " Half-Life . " About the story , he writes . " the inspiration was a challenge to write a story about someone who was dead before the story began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was one of those stories where could n't put my finger on what was unsatisfactory . Then I had the idea o/ changing it to second person , and it clicked . It 's the logical person to use , really , as it 's a story told from the viewpoint of someone who does n't exist in the accepted sense of the word . " <p>
