IN 1926 ALFRED STIEGLITZ ADVISED DUNCAN PHILLIPS , the founder of what is now the Phillips Collection in Washington , D.C. : " I feel that you will not only have to have a large group of Marins but undoubtedly groups of Dove and O'Keeffe , maybe Hartley even , not to speak of my own photographs if you really want your gallery to reflect a growth of something which is typically American and not a reflection of France or Europe . " ( 1 ) In January of that year Stieglitz and Phillips had begun a relationship that was at times harmonious and at other times tumultuous . Their mutual interest in furthering the cause of American art initially brought them together . Stieglitz had just opened his second art gallery in New York City , and Phillips had five years earlier opened an art museum in a section of his family 's house in Washington , D.C. The two men were born a generation apart , Stieglitz in 1864 and Phillips in 1886 . In 1905 , when Phillips was only a sophomore at Yale University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) with the photographer Edward Steichen ( 1879-1973 ) . Stieglitz was an early proponent of European modernism , and from 1902 until 1917 he published Camera Work , an avant-garde journal devoted to modernism and photography . At 291 he exhibited works by European and American modernists , including Auguste Rodin , Henri Matisse , Paul Cezanne , Pablo Picasso , John Marin , Marsden Hartley , and Arthur Dove . During the same period Phillips wrote about art for conventional magazines such as The American Magazine of Art and Scribner 's Magazine and collected paintings by artists such as Arthur B. Davies , Winslow Homer , George Inness , and Albert Pinkham Ryder. ( 3 ) Stieglitz regarded the 1913 International Exhibition of Modem Art in New York City ( better known as the Armory Show ) as a culmination of what he had been doing in his gallery for years . To an acquaintance he wrote : One thing is sure , the people at large and for that matter also the artists , etc. have been made to realize the importance of the work that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work . This much the Exhibition accomplished for us. ( 4 ) Given his conservative tastes , it is not surprising that Phillips 's review of the exhibition was unfavorable . He called the show " stupifying in its vulgarity " and expressed displeasure with the very European radicals whom Stieglitz exhibited in his gallery and wrote about in Camera Work. ( 5 ) In 1916 Phillips began collecting the work of Davies , one of the organizers of the Armory Show . He wrote essays about the artist and in 1916 published a monograph about him . Davies 's scholarly manner appealed to Phillips , and after much debate about abstraction Phillips became more tolerant , although still skeptical , about the significance of the new style . Phillips did not subscribe to the abstractionists ' theory that form should exist for its own sake . He believed that if contemporary art became too far removed from its representational past , it would be left without any meaning for the future . Speaking to the American Federation of the Arts in 1917 , Phillips said : Aesthetics may be rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , art is personal , art is passionate and its fundamental purpose is to communicate the gift of pleasure. ( 6 ) In 1917 Stieglitz closed 291 and ceased publication of Camera Work . The following year he left his wife to move in with Georgia O'Keeffe. ( 7 ) That same year Phillips began planning for the Phillips Memorial Art Gallery , founded as a tribute to both his father and only brother , Jim , who had died within thirteen months of each other . Phillips envisioned a collection that would continue to evolve over time and would juxtapose the work of contemporary artists with that of recognized masters . He referred to the museum as an " American Prado " ( 8 ) to which artists could come to study the masters , just as Edouard Manet had visited the Museo del Pado in Madrid to study the work of Goya , Velazquez , and El Greco . As Phillips began to form his collection , he looked to those American artists whose goal of artistic freedom was just the approach to art that he considered to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' work to be of such high quality that it could hold its own when hung next to the works by El Greco , Cezanne , and Renoir in his own collection . In December 1925 Stieglitz opened a new gallery , which consisted of a single room in the Anderson Galleries building on Park Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street in New York City . It was officially called the Intimate Gallery , but he also referred to it as The Room or Room 303 . Unlike 291 , this gallery focused exclusively on American modernist painters , for he disdained the conventional turn that European art had taken by the mid-1920s . He showed the work of Dove , Hartley , Marin , and O'Keeffe , who were all converts to the modern idea that color and form could be independent of naturalistic representation . They were influenced by Wassily Kandinsky 's theory ( an excerpt of which was first translated into English in Camera Work in 1912 ) that ideas and feelings could be communicated through abstraction . Stieglitz 's constant experimentation in photography also encouraged these artists to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see abstraction as a means rather than an end in itself . It was a way to see the pure essence of an object , which could be used as a springboard toward a truly personal expression . Phillips 's first visit to the Intimate Gallery was in January 1926 , when he went to see an exhibition of Dove 's work . He returned twice that month and bought three paintings , Golden Storm by Dove and two by O'Keeffe  --  My Shanty , Lake George ( Pl . IV ) and Leaf Motif No. 9 . ( Plates omitted ) He also put a reserve on Dove 's Waterfall ( Pl . IX ) , which he later bought . Thus began a relationship between dealer and patron that lasted for the next twenty years . It entailed an active correspondence , with Stieglitz sending Phillips twenty-three letters in 1926 alone , appealing to his interest in American artists . In one letter Stieglitz explained , I have a passion for America and I feel , and have always felt , that if I could not believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what is European , but in the originator , in the American himself digging from within , pictures for me would have no significance. ( 9 ) Phillips agreed entirely , for as early as 1914 he had written an essay entitled " Nationality in Pictures , " which had pushed for a truly American art without foreign influences. ( 10 ) By 1926 Phillips was actively collecting watercolors by Marin , the most prominent of Stieglitz 's artists and the most likely to fetch record prices . Phillips had bought Marin 's Grey Sea ( Pl . III ) and Maine Islands ( Pl . II ) and solicited Stieglitz 's co-operation in holding an exhibition in Washington that would highlight these works . When Phillips and his wife , Marjorie , a painter , visited the show of Marin 's recent work in the Intimate Gallery on December 3 , 1926 , Phillips was particularly taken with the best painting in the show , Back of Bear Mountain ( Pl . V ) . The price was six thousand dollars , more than any American artist , living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since Phillips had recently spent $125,000 for Renoir 's Luncheon of the Boating Party of 1881  --  a record for an impressionist painting at that time  --  Stieglitz reasoned that Phillips would pay a record price for an American work of art . Phillips bought the painting , but he and Stieglitz differed in their perception of the sequence of events that led to the purchase . By Stieglitz 's account , Phillips was not willing to pay the price . He quoted Marjorie Phillips as saying to her husband at one point , " If I felt as you do about the picture I 'd buy it . " ( 11 ) When Stieglitz assured him that no one except Marin and a few insiders would know the price , Phillips told him he would buy the picture . To commemorate the event , Stieglitz gave Marjorie Phillips another Marin watercolor . Then Phillips , always the bargainer , asked Stieglitz what kind of deal he could have on another Marin he very much liked . So Stieglitz gave him a special price on the picture. ( 12 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less expensive Marin watercolors . Stieglitz then said he would give two Marins to the Phillips Memorial Art Gallery if Phillips would buy Back of Bear Mountain . Phillips agreed , reasoning that the three pictures could be considered to have cost two thousand dollars each. ( 13 ) Most important to Phillips was Stieglitz 's agreement to keep the price secret , for Phillips felt that if other dealers found out what he had paid , he would have a hard time buying anything for a reasonable price . After returning to Washington , Phillips sent Stieglitz a telegram that appeared to confuse matters : " SAY AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE AS YOU PLEASE ABOUT OUR AGREEMENT . ALL THAT MATTERS IS OUR HAVING THE MARINS , ESPECIALLY THE BIG ONE . " ( 14 ) Stieglitz interpreted this as permission to tell the story , which the New Yorker and the New York newspapers the Sun and the Dial picked up . Phillips wrote Stieglitz to complain about his treatment by the press : Pemberton in the New Yorker and McBride in the Sun and Dial should really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retracting what they have written , but I dislike a continuation of the publicity and must merely ask you to please put an end to it and to tell these men and all others the straight truth , in the interest of Marin as well as of myself. ( 15 ) Each held fast to his version of the story . In April 1927 Phillips gave his side in an open letter to the editor of Art News. ( 16 ) The disagreement escalated when Stieglitz printed a pamphlet(17) that quoted documents and letters about the sale , including Phillips 's telegram . After this , Phillips broke off direct communication with Stieglitz , thus losing access to the American artists he loved so much . Instead he became more active in purchasing works by Europeans , among them Pierre Bonnard , Georges Braque , and Andre Derain . In just over a year Phillips 's collection of contemporary French paintings grew from two to fifteen , which he assembled in an exhibition entitled Leaders of French Art Today in the autumn of 1927 . In a pointed , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition affirmed that the lead in art had not yet passed from French to American painting. ( 18 ) The eventual reconciliation of dealer and patron was orchestrated by Dove , who knew that Phillips was his most enthusiastic collector . He personally invited Phillips to see his latest works at Stieglitz 's gallery in the autumn of 1927 . However , Phillips had not forgotten his disagreement with Stieglitz and wrote Dove : Perhaps in time Stieglitz will feel like telling me how sorry he is and if that time comes I shall be able to resume my active and whole-hearted interest in the work of the artists who exhibit under his patronage. ( 19 ) Only someone like Dove , who had been a close and trusted friend for twenty years , could have convinced Stieglitz to send an apology . With Phillips 's letter in front of him , Stieglitz wrote five drafts of a reply . He sent the briefest apology and invited Phillips to visit the gallery . On January 7 , 1928 , Phillips returned to the Intimate Gallery for the first time in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bought Huntington Harbor I ( Pl . X ) . Nevertheless , there were continuing conflicts . Stieglitz complained that Phillips 's exchanges and complex payment schedules required " a special staff . " ( 20 ) It also annoyed him that Phillips compared Marin to Matisse and Bonnard . On his side , Phillips complained that Stieglitz appeared to hold back important works and failed to accommodate Phillips 's sudden urges to visit him in New York . When Phillips was past due on a payment in 1938 Stieglitz sent a reminder that prompted Phillips to reply : You still think of me as a rich collector indulging a luxurious hobby instead of as a baffled but loyal and determined patron of favorite painters , like yourself ; one who buys only for a gallery which he founded and controls but which is not his property and which he has to go deep into his private principal to keep afloat during these years when no income is incoming. ( 21 ) Despite frictions , the Phillips Memorial Art Gallery was the first museum to acquire a work by O'Keeffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold retrospective exhibitions of the works of Hartley and Dove . In addition , Phillips gave both Marin and Dove stipends starting during the Great Depression in exchange for first pick of their work . In settling his estate after Stieglitz 's death in 1946 , O'Keeffe fulfilled his wishes by donating nineteen of his cloud photographs to the Phillips Memorial Art Gallery . In the letter accompanying the gift O'Keeffe wrote , " Stieglitz spoke so often of intending to send these himself , I think they will feel much at home with you . " ( 22 ) A traveling exhibition focusing on the relationship between Stieglitz and Phillips , entitled In the American Grain : Arthur Dove , Marsden Hartley , John Marin , Georgia O'Keeffe , and Alfred Stieglitz , is on view at the Phillips Collection in Washington , D.C. , until December 31 .
