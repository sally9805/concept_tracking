WRONG PARALLELS <p> The prevailing expectation in the United States , and certainly among American political leaders , seems to be that the end is near for Cuban President Fidel Castro and his revolution . Indeed , that has been the expectation for some years . In December 1992 , shortly after passage of his Cuban Democracy Act , which tightened the embargo against the island , Congressman Robert G. Torricelli ( D-N.J. ) assured Americans that Castro would fall within weeks . Senator jesse Helms ( R-N.C. ) , in putting forward legislation last year with Congressman Dan Burton ( R-Ind. ) to further tighten the embargo , said Castro was on the ropes and needed only a final shove . The Helms-Burton bill would prohibit the normalization of relations with any future government that included Castro . <p> The only real debate has been over how the end might come . Would it be as in Romania , with the demise of a communist leader at the hands of his enraged people ? Or as in Poland and the former Czechoslovakia , where dissident leaders took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove apt . Communist governments were imposed on Eastern Europe at the points of Soviet bayonets . Once the bayonets were withdrawn , the collapse of those regimes was inevitable , however the endgame might play out . In Cuba , foreign bayonets were never needed ; communism arrived on the crest of a popular nationalist movement . True , communism was not what Castro had promised . But if it was the path along which he , the most popular leader in Cuban history , wished to lead the country , the great majority of Cubans were prepared to follow at the time . Castro continues to enjoy considerable popular support ( whether or not a majority ) , and the army and security forces are behind him . So it is a mistake to think he will resign . To resign would be to admit defeat , and Castro is far from defeated . <p> Castro is not in the type of predicament faced by Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev . His situation more closely resembles that of Francisco Franco in Spain after World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heritage . Both bet on the wrong side of history . In Franco 's case , the bet was on World War II . One may argue about the degree of his cooperation with the Axis powers , but his sympathies were clear . He saw conservative authoritarianism as the wave of the future , to be assured by Axis victory . <p> Franco was wrong . The victory of the Allied powers left Spain politically and economically isolated . Spain was not even allowed to join the United Nations or participate in the Marshall Plan . To gain acceptance , to stay afloat in the new NATO-controlled , democratic sea that Western Europe had become , Spain had to adjust . Pragmatically , Franco began to do so , not because he wished to but because he had little choice . The pace was deliberate , with Franco maintaining tight control throughout . Spain did not attain full democracy until Franco passed from the scene in 1975 , but he had laid the groundwork for both democracy and a modern economy . LESSONS FROM FRANCO <p> Castro also made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . He now has no alternative but to reintegrate Cuba into an international community he never anticipated . Like Franco , he is beginning pragmatically . One of Castro 's first steps in re-fashioning the Cuban economy was similar to Franco 's : a vast expansion of the tourism industry to take advantage of Cuba 's beautiful beaches and low prices . Cuba attracted some 800,000 tourists last year , up from a only a few thousand in 1985 . Tourism replaced sugar as the islands principal hard currency earner and could easily double over the next five years . <p> In 1993 , Castro did what he had said he would never do : permit Cubans to own and spend dollars and hold dollar-denominated bank accounts . He also authorized self-employment in some 100 occupations , mostly in the service sector . This meant that individual Cubans could open private television repair shops , laundries , restaurants , and many other small enterprises . Officially they were forbidden by the Cuban government to employ others , but many did and still do . <p> The next step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets . After meeting their contracts with state enterprises , farmers now may sell their surplus production for whatever the market will bear . The makeup of the agricultural sector has also begun to change . Before the reforms , some 100,000 small private farms operated on the island . Semiprivate farms have now been added to that stock . State farms have given way to cooperatives in which farmers often have the right to use land ( but not own it outright ) , and they can produce and sell as they see fit . <p> Since December 1994 citizens have been allowed to sell handicrafts and a variety of light manufactures in artisan markets . Thus , rather than the empty public spaces one used to encounter on weekends , Cathedral Square in Havana and squares and parks all over Cuba are now crowded with people not only selling handicrafts to tourists , but selling shoes , clothing , beer , and sandwiches to one another , providing musical entertainment , singing , dancing , and having a good time . One senses in these scenes the depth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Cuban joie de vivre have replaced the despair of 1993 . <p> As in Franco 's Spain , foreign investment has been key to Cuba 's economic turnaround . This influx of capital has been given a new impetus by a foreign investment law enacted in mid-1995 that makes it possible for foreign investors to own Cuban enterprises not just in tourism but in virtually every area of the economy . Some 60 companies have opened offices in Cuba so far , and many more have invested in Cuban enterprises . Figures are difficult to come by , but a carefully calculated estimate by the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council places foreign investment to date at over $5 billion and growing . This is a respectable amount , but not nearly enough to provide the economic transformation Cuba requires . <p> Sherritt International of Canada alone has already committed half a billion dollars to oil exploration and the development of cobalt and nickel mining . It is also investing in transportation , agriculture ( including sugar ) , real estate , tourism , communications , and finance . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-country businesses that invest in Cuba . Like Sherritt 's executives , many other foreign businessmen in Cuba are unimpressed by the threat . They are more angered than intimidated by Helms-Burton and predict that if it becomes law few foreign investors will pull out . They acknowledge that some investments are now on hold because of it , but note that so long as profits can be had , other companies will replace those who hesitate or withdraw . For example , the Guitart group pulled out but was immediately replaced by Tryp , another Spanish hotel chain . The effect of making Helms-Burton law , then , is likely to be minor . In addition to its other problems , legal experts say it will not stand up in U.S. courts . <p> Finally , through a strategy that combines increased use of bagasse as fuel , more domestic production of petroleum ( which over the past three years has almost doubled to 1.5 million tons ) , and more imports from Russia , Cuba 's energy crisis appears to be on the way to a solution . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import of 13 million tons from the Soviet Union plunged to less than 7 million tons . BACK FROM THE ABYSS <p> And the result of these reforms ? After a decline in economic output of some 40 percent between 1989 and 1994 , the free fall has ended . The growth rate for 1995 was over 2.5 percent and is estimated to double in 1996 . The price of the dollar has dropped from 125 pesos in mid-1994 to 25-35 pesos . For a short period in August , it went down to 12 . Basic foodstuffs that were in critically short supply in mid-1994 have become far more plentiful . The price of beans has dropped from over 60 pesos a pound to 13 pesos and that of rice from 50 pesos to 5 . <p> Intentional energy blackouts , which in mid-1994 sometimes lasted 18 hours a day , 7 days a week , in most areas are now a few hours a week and in some areas have ended entirely . As a Cuban office worker said , " That is the greatest relief of all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no fans or air conditioning at work and it is so hot at night that one ca n't sleep , one 's temper begins to fray . " <p> The new investment law opens the way for Cuban exiles to return , invest , and open businesses . This is a welcome step , but it has sparked resentment among some Cuban residents , who question why exiles are permitted to open businesses while they are not . They may soon get their wish . Cuban officials have acknowledged that to rationalize the state sector they may over time have to lay off as many as a million state employees . Unprofitable factories must be closed and many government agencies drastically cut back . How are these masses of newly unemployed to be absorbed ? There is only one way : expand the private sector . Hence , a new small business law is under discussion . When it is enacted , probably this year , the law will allow groups of citizens , rather than only individuals , to pool their resources and open small private enterprises that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employees they may hire . <p> One step has led to another in this transition . Legalization of the dollar in the Cuban economy raised the need for a realistic official exchange rate , which Cuban economists are still trying to determine . The self-employment and foreign investment laws increased the calls for a small business law , and that , in turn , will lead to foreign investment in new Cuban private enterprises . The government , pressured by the military and others to continue reform , will doubtless resist at first . But eventually it will have to accommodate them , perhaps by setting up state clearing-houses for foreign investments . Small businesses must have capital to prosper , and it is in the government 's interest to ensure they get it . How else they be able to absorb the growing numbers of unemployed ? <p> As one economic reform leads to another , pressure for political change will increase . Soon , for example , as many as one million former state employees will be earning a living in private endeavors of one kind or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented . They will turn to the National Assembly , pushing it to become a truly representative body . Economic reforms , in short , set up an equation : the more Cuban citizens enter the private sector , the greater the imperative for a more representative government . POLITICAL CREEP <p> Political changes will come more slowly than economic reforms and mostly in their wake . Cubans have watched with horror the socioeconomic breakdown in the Soviet Union and a number of Eastern European states , resulting , they believe , from going too far too fast and losing control of the reform process . They are determined not to let that happen in Cuba . Also , Cuban officials argue that the midst of an economic crisis is not the time for political experimentation . Only after the crisis , they insist , can one contemplate more significant political reforms . Some go even further and see Cuba following a Chinese model of reform , which allows significant economic liberalization but minimal political change . <p> Such a model may be appropriate for Cuba 's situation today , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . China is a huge country with oil , coal , and other natural resources and a domestic market so large it is almost irresistible to international business . China can be self-sufficient to a degree that Cuba can not and is therefore less vulnerable to external pressures . To reinsert itself into the international economic community , Cuba must make more concessions and adjustments than China . <p> China has had little pressure for political liberalization from its Asian neighbors , the United States , or Europe . This is not the case with Cuba . Leaving U.S. demands aside , Cuba faces growing insistence from Canada , European trading partners , and Latin American states that it move further toward representative democracy . Unlike the United States , these countries believe engagement and trade will do more to encourage Cuban reform than efforts to isolate it politically and strangle it economically . The pressures nonetheless are real , and Cuba must deal with them , especially if it hopes to fully participate in the Organization of American States and hemispheric bodies such as the Inter-American Development Bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better parallel than China 's transition under Deng Xiaoping . Franco 's first steps toward a more open political system and improving Spain 's image came immediately after World War II , when he extended conditional liberty to thousands of political prisoners , halted censorship of foreign news-men ( but not of the Spanish press ) , abolished the Falange militia , and announced that Spain over time would become a traditional Christian monarchy . The question of restoring the monarchy , he said , would be settled " when the nation 's interest demands it . " <p> After that , his style of governance changed gradually . His critical moves toward democracy  --  the liberalization process that began in 1965 and his designation in 1969 of Prince Juan Carlos ( in effect , the king-in-waiting ) as his successor  --  came much later . By then , the transformation of Spain 's poor , agrarian , centralized economy into one more closely resembling the rest of Europe was well advanced . <p> If anything , Cuba is changing more rapidly than Franco 's Spain , if only because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion of religious liberty began more than a decade ago , for example , and Cuban citizens , by and large , are free to practice their faiths without fear of persecution . Believers can even become members of the Communist Party ( if they can reconcile their faith with the party 's history of atheism ) . Earlier tensions between church and state have largely been overcome , and negotiations for a papal visit are ongoing . <p> Since the mid-1970s , Cubans have been able to vote in fair and democratic municipal elections . Voting is by secret ballot , and the process of nominating candidates is remarkably open . One does not have to be a member of the Communist Party to run for office . In fact , the party plays no role in city elections . As one member of the Cuban National Assembly put it , " Rather than a multiparty system , we have a no-party electoral system . " <p> But the municipal councils do not deal with national , let alone international , issues . Those are debated or , some would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its members were appointed , not elected by popular ballot . In February of that year , the electoral law was reformed so that citizens of each municipality could elect their National Assembly representatives . Unfortunately , the nominating process was tightly controlled and , worse , only one candidate could vie for each seat . The subsequent vote may have been meaningful as a general referendum on the Castro regime because the high voter turnout indicated a willingness to legitimize the government 's attempts at reform . But as an election , it was a farce . <p> Still , it was a step forward . Cuban officials say that there is no reason the electoral law can not be changed further . Perhaps by the next elections , in 1998 , the nominating process will be more open and there will be more than one candidate for each slot . Meanwhile , the Assembly has gained in importance , and the elections of 1993 brought in new , younger faces more open to reform . <p> A multiparty system is probably a decade or more away , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern . Some Cuban officials have suggested that the Communist Party be abolished in favor of a Cuban Revolutionary Party , the single party called for by the father of Cuban independence , Jose Marti . Eventually other groups would be allowed to register as opposition or at least independent parties . These officials insist , however , that for the next few decades Cuba should stick to a system in which no party plays a role in elections . " We simply do not want to get into the kind of debilitating party politics we see in surrounding countries , " a Cuban political observer said . " There must be a better way of giving the people a voice in government . " <p> Whatever system emerges and however reluctant Castro may be to admit it , most thoughtful Cubans understand that they are moving toward something new an economy that mixes private enterprise with a continued role for the state and a far more open political system . It will probably look like social democracy to Americans , although Cubans will almost certainly continue to describe it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve the gains of the revolution , such as free education and health care and a high degree of equality . STICK WITH CASTRO <p> The dominant view among American political leaders seems to be that Castro must go before meaningful change can take place . The Clinton administration does not demand his ouster as a precondition for normalization , but it has described him as a " lost cause " or " irrelevant " and expressed disbelief that sufficient change could occur under his tutelage . Clearly it would prefer a peaceful transition without him . Helms-Burton goes further , ruling out engagement with any government that includes him . But Castro 's departure or ouster is unlikely to occur soon , and it is probably undesirable . <p> Immediately after World War II , the consensus in Spain and the rest of the world was that Franco 's days in office were numbered . Was he not without allies , his soul mates having gone down in defeat ? Within a decade , however , it was acknowledged not only that Franco , with or without allies , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best guarantee that Spain 's transition from dictatorship to democracy would be peaceful and relatively smooth . He is well remembered in Spain today for just that . <p> Most Cubans on the island , including many who disagree with Castro , see him playing a similar role . He is the only political figure with the authority to order reforms and make them stick , and he is the only one who can prevent the various political factions from plunging the country into a bloodbath . They know that his instincts are not democratic and the evolutionary pace he favors will mean an elongated process . Some are impatient with that , but most seem to prefer that scenario to a more dramatic and possibly dangerous denouement . A crucial point is that they see no alternative . It is all well and good to speak of Castro 's immediate ouster , but who would replace him ? Elections are well and good , but who would run against him ? The Cuban people see no one in the wings , and thus their understandable reaction is to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States that most Americans find it difficult to believe the Cuban people do not want him immediately overthrown or dead . How can they support a man who is said to be a bloody tyrant and murderer with the worst human rights record in the world ? The revolution unarguably has a dark side . Castro is not a democrat and not inclined to tolerate dissent . People are indeed locked up for expressing opposition and are sometimes handled roughly . Human rights activists calculate that as many as 900 men and women remain behind bars for crimes of a political nature ( down from tens of thousands in the 1960s ) . These ills can not be condoned and must be overcome if Cuba is to gain full acceptance in the international community . <p> But most Cubans see another side of the revolution , the side that has provided free education , excellent free health care , a high degree of equality , and , most important , a sense of national pride . Until the economic crisis resulting from the collapse of the Soviet Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution . Because of these economic difficulties , many would now like to abandon the revolution , as evidenced by the refugee crisis of 1994 . One should not lose sight of the fact , however , that far more Cubans are prepared to stay and see it through , even as they grumble over their plight . The majority of Cubans are black , and they have benefited most from the revolution . That majority wants to see change , but not a return to the pre-1959 situation , which the rhetoric of the white anti-Castro exiles often seems to threaten . Instruments such as the Helms-Burton legislation , which is so clearly driven by those same exiles , simply strengthens the resolve of the black majority and most other Cubans to stick with Castro . <p> Franco , of course , had one luxury that Castro does not : a king-in-waiting to whom power could be given , who symbolized the nation and could hold it together after Franco departed . While Cuba does not have a Juan Carlos , Castro is preparing a new generation of leaders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Council of State , who directs the economy , Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez , National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon , and Army Chief of Staff Ulises Rosales are already directing the country 's day-to-day business . By the time Castro passes from the scene 10 or 12 years from now , whether through death or resignation , these and other new leaders will be ready to step in and carry on . Given such an extended period , a successor who could peacefully assume power will likely have been chosen . THE EXILE COMMUNITY <p> Only in the United States has a Cuban exile community had a strong impact on policy toward Cuba , and even here that impact results more from miscalculations by American politicians than from the strength of the anti-Castro exiles . <p> The Cuban-American community is by no means monolithic ; it is now about evenly divided between those who favor some degree of dialogue with the Castro government and those who are bitterly opposed . This is true even though the vast majority of Cuban-Americans regard themselves as strongly anti-Castro and most remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Cuban-American vote does not and probably never will determine the electoral outcome in Florida or even in Dade County , where most of the state 's Cuban-Americans live . Clinton , for example , won the county even though only 18 percent of Cuban-Americans voted for him . He lost in the northern counties , where few Cuban-Americans live , over issues that had nothing to do with Cuba . Thus his effort in 1992 to win Florida by supporting the Cuban Democracy Act and taking a hard line on Cuba came to exactly zero . He got 39 percent of the vote in Florida , precisely what Dukakis had received four years earlier . <p> If either a Democratic or Republican administration wished to change U.S. policy toward Cuba , it could easily do so . The protests of ultraconservative Cuban exiles would cause little political damage . The reaction is likely to be even less consequential in years to come as a new , less revanchist generation of Cuban-Americans comes to the fore and more moderate leaders gain strength . After World War II , strong Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped persuade the international community not to accept Spain or allow it U.N . membership . But as the years passed and it became increasingly clear that the exiles had no prescription for bringing about change at home and certainly not for replacing the Franco government , their voices were heeded less and less . Such is likely to be the case with the virulently anti-Castro exiles . AN EMBARGO ON AMERICA 'S EMBARGO <p> U.S. policy toward Cuba still seems to be in a Cold War time warp . Although Cuba has removed its troops from Africa , stopped promoting revolution in Central America , and lost the Soviet military ties of old , the United States persists in tightening the screws . The United States still seeks a more open Cuban political system , greater respect for human rights , and compensation for properties expropriated under Castro 's revolution . In fashioning a policy to further those aims , however , the Clinton administration might note that Spain 's major advances toward democracy came after the United States had normalized relations with it , signed an economic-military agreement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations in 1955 . Engagement , in other words , produced better results than ostracism . <p> The rest of the world favors engagement ( as does the United States with most other authoritarian countries ) and rejects U.S. policy toward Cuba . The vote in the U.N . General Assembly against the U.S. embargo last November was 117 to 3 ; in 1994 it was 101 to 2 . The only countries voting with the United States were Israel and Uzbekistan , and both trade with Cuba . In other words , not a single government cooperates with the U.S. embargo . Nevertheless , the Helms-Burton legislation would have the president insist to the Security Council that other U.N . members join the embargo . The legislation 's extraterritorial punitive measures risk major quarrels with Canada , Mexico , Russia , and the European Union . <p> Nor is commerce the only arena in which present policy is counterproductive . America 's overriding interest in Cuba and most other Caribbean states is that their populations remain in place . The United States does not want tens of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became abundantly clear during the refugee crisis of 1994 , when legions of Cubans set out on rafts for Florida . The Clinton administration temporarily resolved the crisis by entering into an agreement with Castro on September 9 , 1994 , to stem the flow . It concluded another agreement on May 2 , 1995 , which requires the Coast Guard to return those picked up on the high seas directly to Cuba . Otherwise , the administration left the old policy intact . So although the overwhelming majority attempting to flee were economic refugees , the embargo , which adds to the island 's economic difficulties , was left in place . The Cuban embargo is the only embargo of the United States that effectively prohibits the sale of food and medicine , in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 . A MORE SENSIBLE APPROACH <p> Current policy does not serve U.S. interests or further its objectives in Cuba . It neither advances the cause of human rights and a more open system nor reduces the possibility of another refugee outflow . It complicates relations with America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cuban market . The latter is not large , but a recent trade study estimated that the United States and Cuba could quickly be doing some $7 billion a year in business. 2 <p> Against these losses , U.S. policy achieves nothing . It does not even serve the domestic political interests of the Clinton administration . Still , a total lifting of the embargo might be politically risky . The president would doubtless be accused of giving away something for nothing . However , there is a sensible way to begin to change policy . The United States should halt all efforts to interfere with the trade and investment of other countries in Cuba , lift the embargo on the sale of food and medicine because it is inconsistent with international practice , and lift all travel restrictions , which are of dubious constitutionality and infringe on the rights of American citizens . Having thus shown good faith , the United States should say that it is ready to have a new relationship with Cuba , quickly remove other parts of the embargo , and enter into negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which Cuban officials have indicated they are willing to discuss . The United States should emphasize , however , that the pace of normalization would depend in part on how meaningfully Cuba moves ahead with internal reforms . America would lose nothing substantial through such an approach , vastly increase the possibility of playing a constructive role in Cuba 's transition , and avoid damaging its relations with other countries . <p> Unfortunately , all indications are that the United States will stick to the same old Cold War approach of the past 35 years . The much-ballyhooed opening to Cuba announced in President Clinton 's foreign policy speech of October 6 , 1995 , has turned out to be mostly smoke . Although he spoke of vastly increased academic exchanges , the restrictions on them remain largely unchanged . Cuban-Americans can now ostensibly make one trip to Cuba per year without a license but only in cases of extreme humanitarian need . As the " need " is not monitored , however , increasing numbers have travelled to the island , albeit with a dubious justification . Clinton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open in Cuba was not new . A similar offer was made in 1977 and reiterated over the years . The Cubans have always rejected the offer , saying it would not be an even trade because Cuba has only one news agency . In most cases , they will probably say no again . <p> Despite growing pressure from U.S. businesses , which resent their own government handing the Cuban market to foreign competitors , signals from both the White House and Congress suggest that Cuba policy will not change significantly for at least another two years . If the Helms-Burton legislation becomes law , change could be delayed for much longer . <p> It may be just as well . Cuba will survive without the United States , and the United States will certainly survive without Cuba . Cuba will move ahead with its reforms , continue to expand its commercial ties with other countries , and eventually end up , like Spain , with a very different society . But it will be a society based on Cuban realities , not those of Washington or Miami . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill becomes the basis of U.S. policy , it might be better that the two countries remain at arm 's length for some years to come . These appraisals are based on hundreds of interviews and conversations the author has had with Cubans over the past few years .
