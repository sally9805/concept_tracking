Ever since the Dow Jones industrial average topped 7000 for the first time two weeks ago , investors like Marie Kordus have become increasingly scared to look down . You could call it verti-Dow . " I try not to watch the market every day because it will make me crazy and I 'm afraid I 'll make the wrong decisions , " says Kordus , 41 , who runs a hip-hop radio station in Los Angeles and has built a portfolio of stocks that have jumped about 25% in value in the past two years . <P> Kordus has plenty of partners in anxiety as every lurch in the market  --  the Dow index did a three-day wiggle and dropped 57.34 points to close at 6931.62 last week  --  makes skittish investors wonder whether it 's finally time to pull the rip cord and cash out . " The average person is very jittery but is still bringing in money in hopes of staying with the bull market , " says Robert Coleman , an investment adviser with the firm Christopher Weil &; Co. in San Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think ? ' " Coleman adds . " I say , ' Relax , stay in the market and enjoy it . ' " <P> For now , at least , Coleman and a chorus of like-minded gurus may well have it right . Since the Dow stood at 3300 four years ago , the tireless trend of the market has reflected an astonishingly resilient and inflation-free U.S. expansion that , like the Energizer Bunny , just keeps going . The economy grew at a robust 4.7% rate in the fourth quarter of 1996 , for example , and last week the government reported that consumer prices rose a barely perceptible 0.1% in January . <P> " I do n't see any end in sight for this bull market " are the ready-for-framing words of John Hsu , who runs his own New York City investment group with $500 million in assets . " The U.S. economy is the best I 've seen in my professional career , which is 35 years . As long as the fundamentals stay this way , the music will keep on playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader of a worldwide boom in stocks . With inflation falling globally , stock markets have recently hit new highs from Argentina to Taiwan . In Europe , where declining interest rates have helped raise stock prices , France , Germany , Switzerland and other countries have been on their own bull runs . <P> By all the conventional measures of Wall Street , the market seems ripe for a setback . Not only are stocks heavily overpriced in relation to corporate earnings  --  the P/E ratio is now about 19  --  but the average dividend yield , which measures dividends as a percentage of prices , has fallen to an all-time low of less than 2% . Both gauges suggest the type of heedless buying that often precedes a bust . The public 's hunger for shares has led Austin Grill , a chain of Tex-Mex eateries in the Washington area , to offer diners a helping of its new public offering along with their enchiladas . When stocks make it to menus , can the Alka-Seltzer be far behind ? <P> Yet a short-term correction could be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . " We 're going to see ups and downs , and that would be healthy , " says financial consultant Bert Ely . " The market needs some time for earnings to catch up with prices . But in the longer term , interest rates could well decline , and that would definitely be bullish , putting a firmer floor under the market 's high levels . "
