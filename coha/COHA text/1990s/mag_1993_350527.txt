In Bordeaux , Burgundy and Tuscany , 1993 was an iffy year for winemaking , thanks to preharvest rains . That 's the bad news for oenophiles . The good news is that 1993 has been a vintage year for books about their favorite beverage , with several volumes that qualify as collectibles . <P> Although it costs as much as a bottle of Perrier-Jouet brut , many wine lovers will consider the new ( third ) edition of Parker 's Wine Buyer 's Guide ( Simon &; Schuster ; $40 ) an indispensable purchase . The nation 's pre-eminent guru of grape , Robert M. Parker Jr. , is writer-publisher of a plain-as-plonk ( no ads , no pictures ) bimonthly newsletter , The Wine Advocate . His trenchant opinions , as well as his still debated ratings of wine on a 100- point scale , are recycled into columns for the Prodigy computer network and Wine Enthusiast and Food &; Wine magazines . They also feed his awesomely detailed Guide , which includes ahs and boos for 7,500 wines . Parker devotes more lineage to bottom-drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice here on $6 Cabernet Sauvignons from Chile and good-value Chardonnays from South Australia . But few readers will ever get to share his delight in $500 Montrachets that have long since vanished from the marketplace . <P> Out of earshot , some California vintners complain that Parker is unfair to their state 's wines . That 's a canard when you consider his consistent raves for Kistler Chards , say , or Ravenswood Zinfandels . Still , wine buyers in need of a different perspective may cotton to The New Connoisseurs ' Handbook of California Wines ( Knopf ; $24 ) by Norman S. Roby and Charles E. Olken . Their judgments are more muted than Parker 's , but they appraise some competent producers  --  Stags ' Leap Winery in Napa County , for instance  --  that he ignores . <P> So you know what your favorite California wine tastes like . But where is it made ? And what does the countryside look like ? For answers , consider one of two new coffee-table atlases of West Coast wineland . The Wine Atlas of California ( Viking ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viticultural Areas ( AVAS ) , the U.S. government 's muddled system of classifying the nation 's wine-growing regions . Halliday , who is Australia 's leading wine critic , writes with considerable zip and has a fine eye for the offbeat . Profiling the imaginative " Gunny-Bunny " team from Sonoma County 's Gundlach Bundschu winery , for example , he notes that they once donned masks , waved toy guns and hijacked the famed Napa Valley Wine Train , forcing its startled passengers to sample Gundlach Bundschu wines . <P> The Wine Atlas of California and the Pacific Northwest ( Simon &; Schuster ; $45 ) is also organized by AVAS . Its military-precise maps are much better than those in Halliday 's atlas , which are mostly in murky shades of camouflage green . But author Bob Thompson 's prose is pedestrian , and his assessments of wineries have as much tang as blush Zin.
