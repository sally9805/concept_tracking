For eight straight years , New York City had been pounded with one act of racial violence after another . 1982 : Willie Turks , a black transit worker , is beaten to death by a mob of whites shouting racial slurs . 1984 : Bernhard Goetz wounds four young blacks he said were menacing him on the subway. 1986 : a white mob in the Howard Beach section of Queens attacks several blacks , one of whom fled in panic onto a highway and was killed by a passing car . 1989 : a 28- year-old white executive is beaten and raped in Central Park by a pack of black teenagers out on a hell-raising spree that added the word wilding to the lexicon of urban fear . <P> And then in the midst of a bitter mayoral campaign pitting three-term incumbent Edward I. Koch against a black challenger , Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins , came the murder of Yusuf Hawkins . He was a 16-year- old black who with a group of friends ventured into the tightly knit , mostly Italian Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a gang of whites armed with baseball bats and a gun . When the melee was over , Hawkins lay dead with two bullet wounds in his chest . <P> The murder stunned a city already beset by spiraling racial tensions . To many New Yorkers it symbolized a breakdown in racial civility that had no quick explanation or readily available cure . Some of the youths accused of killing Hawkins were jobless school dropouts with histories of drug abuse  --  mirror images in whiteface of underclass young black males . The whites had armed themselves on the night of Aug. 23 because the former girlfriend of their alleged leader , Keith Mondello , had invited black and Hispanic guests to her birthday party . They mistook Yusuf and his comrades for those guests . <P> Whatever the motive for the killing , tension mounted after a series of protest marches through Bensonhurt led by one of the city 's most flamboyant rabble-rousers , the Rev. Al Sharpton . Inflammatory press coverage added to the heat . When the first two Bensonhurst youths charged with the killing went on trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripped the city . Not-guilty verdicts , blustered Sharpton , would be " telling us to burn the town down . " <P> So it was that , with the exception of some outraged whites in Bensonhurst , New Yorkers heaved an almost palpable sigh of relief last week when a jury consisting of six whites , three blacks , two Hispanics and an Asian convicted the accused gunman of second-degree murder . But only one day later , the relief was replaced by dismay . A second jury acquitted Mondello , 19 , of murder and manslaughter but found him guilty of several lesser charges . <P> At the verdict , Mondello 's father Michael yelled , " Thank God ! Jesus has risen ! " The Hawkins family , seated across the aisle , shrieked in dismay and , pointing at the jurors , shouted , " He did it ! He did it ! " As night fell on Friday , crowds of angry blacks milled about in Brooklyn , disrupting traffic and throwing rocks and bottles . Fires , possibly ignited by arsonists , erupted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few whites , including several newsmen , were attacked but suffered only minor injuries .
