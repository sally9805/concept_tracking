Chapter One Climbs Quickly scurried up the nearest trunk , then paused at the first cross-branch to clean his sticky true-hands and hand-feet with fastidious care . He hated crossing between trees now that the cold days were passing into those of mud . Not that he was particularly fond of snow , either , he admitted with a bleek of laughter , but at least it melted out of his fur-eventually-instead of forming gluey clots that dried hard as rock . Still , there were compensations to warming weather , and he sniffed appreciatively at the breeze that rustled the furled buds just beginning to fringe the all-but-bare branches . Under most circumstances , he would have climbed all the way to the top to luxuriate in the wind fingers ruffling his coat , but he had other things on his mind today . He finished grooming himself , then rose on his rear legs in the angle of the cross-branch and trunk to scan his surroundings with grass-green eyes . None of the two-legs were in sight , but that meant little ; two-legs were full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen little of them until lately , but other clans had observed them for twelve full turnings of the seasons , and it was obvious they had tricks the People had never mastered . Among those was some way to keep watch from far away-so far , indeed , that the People could neither hear nor taste them , much less see them . Yet Climbs Quickly detected no sign that he was being watched , and he flowed smoothly to the adjacent trunk , following the line of cross-branches deeper into the clearing . His clan had not been too apprehensive when the first flying thing arrived and the two-legs emerged to create the clearing , for the clans whose territory had already been invaded had warned them of what to expect . The two-legs could be dangerous , and they kept changing things , but they were n't like death fangs or snow hunters , who all too often killed randomly or for pleasure , and scouts and hunters like Climbs Quickly had watched that first handful of two-legs from the cover of the frost-bright leaves , perched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying strange things-some that glittered or blinked flashing lights and others that stood on tall , skinny legs-which they moved from place to place and peered through , and then they 'd driven stakes of some equally strange not-wood into the ground at intervals . The Bright Water memory singers had sung back through the songs from other clans and decided that the things they peered through were tools of some sort . Climbs Quickly could n't argue their conclusion , yet the two-leg tools were as different from the hand axes and knives the People made as the substance from which they were made was unlike the flint , wood , and bone the People used . All of which explained why the two-legs must be watched most carefully ... and secretly . Small as the People were , they were quick and clever , and their axes and knives and use of fire let them accomplish things larger but less clever creatures could not . Yet the shortest two-leg stood more than two People-lengths in height . Even if their tools had been no better than the People 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better ) their greater size would have made them far more effective . And if there was no sign that the two-legs intended to threaten the People , there was also no sign they did not , so no doubt it was fortunate they were so easy to spy upon . Climbs Quickly slowed as he reached the final cross-branch . He sat for long , still moments , cream and gray coat blending into invisibility against trunks and branches veiled in a fine spray of tight green buds , motionless but for a single true-hand which groomed his whiskers reflexively . He listened carefully , with ears and thoughts alike , and those ears pricked as he tasted the faint mind glow that indicated the presence of two-legs . It was n't the clear , bright communication it would have been from one of the People , for the two-legs appeared to be mind-blind , yet there was something ... nice about it . Which was odd , for whatever else they were , the two-legs were very unlike the People . The memory singers of every clan had sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared twelve season-turnings back . They 'd sought any song of any other clan which might tell them something-anything-about these strange creatures and whence they had come ... or at least why . No one had been able to answer those questions , yet the memory singers of the Blue Mountain Dancing Clan and the Fire Runs Fast Clan had remembered a very old song-one which went back almost two hundred turnings . The song offered no clue to the two-legs ' origins or purpose , but it did tell of the very first time the People had ever seen two-legs and how the long ago scout who 'd brought it back to his singers had seen their egg-shaped silver thing come down out of the very sky in light and fire and a sound more terrible than any thunder . That had been enough to send the People of that time scurrying into hiding , and they 'd watched from the shadows and leaves-much as Climbs Quickly did now . The first scout to see the masters of that silver egg emerge from it had been joined by others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no one had approached the intruders . Perhaps they might have , had not a death fang attempted to eat one of the two-legs . People did n't like death fangs . The huge creatures looked much like outsized People , but unlike People , they were far from clever . Not that something their size really needed to be clever . Death fangs were the biggest , strongest , most deadly hunters in all the world . Unlike People , they often killed for the sheer pleasure of it , and they feared nothing that lived ... except the People . They never passed up the opportunity to eat a single scout or hunter if they happened across one stupid enough to be caught on the ground , but even death fangs avoided the heart of any clan 's range . Individual size meant little when an entire clan swarmed down from the trees to attack . Yet the death fang who attacked one of the two-legs had discovered something new to fear . None of the watching People had ever heard anything like the ear shattering " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the charging death fang had suddenly somersaulted end-for-end , crashed to the ground , and lain still , with a bloody hole blown clear through it . Once they got over their immediate shock , the watching scouts had taken a fierce delight in the death fang 's fate , but anything that could kill a death fang with a single bark could certainly do the same to one of the People , and so the decision had been made to avoid the two-legs until the watchers learned more about them . Unfortunately , the scouts were still watching from hiding when , after perhaps a quarter turning , they dismantled the strange , square living places in which they had dwelt , went back into their egg , and disappeared once more into the sky . All of that had been long , long ago , and Climbs Quickly regretted that no more had been learned of them before they left . He understood the need for caution , yet he wished the Blue Mountain Dancing scouts had been just a little less careful . Perhaps then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted-or what the People should do about them-between their first arrival and their reappearance . Personally , Climbs Quickly thought those first two-legs had been scouts , as he himself was . Certainly it would have made sense for the two-legs to send scouts ahead ; any clan did the same when expanding or changing its range . Yet if that was the case , why had the rest of their clan delayed so long before following them ? And why did the two-legs spread themselves so thinly ? The living place in the clearing he 'd come to watch had required great labor by over a dozen two-legs to create , even with their clever tools , and it was large enough for a full clan . Yet its builders had simply gone away when they finished . It had stood completely empty for over ten days , and even now it housed only three of the two-legs , one of them-unless Climbs Quickly was mistaken-but a youngling . He sometimes wondered what had happened to the youngling 's litter mates , but the important point was that the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprive them of any communication with their fellows . That was one reason many of the watchers believed two-legs were unlike People in all ways , not just their size and shape and tools . It was the ability to communicate with their fellows which made People people , after all . Only unthinking creatures-like the death fangs , or the snow hunters , or those upon whom the People themselves preyed-lived sealed within themselves , so if the two-legs were not only mind-blind but chose to avoid even their own kind , they could not be people . But Climbs Quickly disagreed . He could n't fully explain why , even to himself , yet he was convinced the two-legs were , in fact , people-of a sort , at least . They fascinated him , and he 'd listened again and again to the song of the first two-legs and their egg , both in an effort to understand what it was they 'd wanted and because even now that song carried overtones of something he thought he had tasted from the two-legs he spied upon . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Sings Truly first sang it for Bright Water Clan . That often happened to older songs or those which had been relayed for great distances , and this song was both ancient and from far away . Though its images remained clear and sharp , they had been subtly shaped and shadowed by all the singers who had come before Sings Truly . Climbs Quickly knew what the two-legs of the song had done , but he knew nothing about why they 'd done it , and the interplay of so many singers ' minds had blurred any mind glow the long ago watchers might have tasted . Climbs Quickly had shared what he thought he 'd picked up from " his " two-legs only with Sings Truly . It was his duty to report to the memory singers , of course , and so he had . But he 'd implored Sings Truly to keep his suspicions only in her own song for now , for some of the other scouts would have laughed uproariously at them . Sings Truly had n't laughed , but neither had she rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel in person to the Blue Mountain Dancing or Fire Runs Fast Clan 's range to receive the original song from their senior singers . But that was out of the question . Singers were the core of any clan , the storehouse of memory and dispensers of wisdom . They were always female , and their loss could not be risked , whatever Sings Truly might want . Unless a clan was fortunate enough to have a surplus of singers , it must protect its potential supply of replacements by denying them more dangerous tasks . Climbs Quickly understood that , but he found its implications a bit harder to live with than the clan 's other scouts and hunters did . There could be disadvantages to being a memory singer 's brother when she chose to sulk over the freedoms her role denied her ... and allowed him . Climbs Quickly gave another soft chitter of laughter ( it was safe enough ; Sings Truly was too far away to taste his thoughts ) , then crept stealthily out to the last trunk . He climbed easily to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leaves and branches . The cold days ' ravages required a few repairs , but there was no hurry . It remained serviceable , and it would be many days yet before the slowly budding leaves could provide the needed materials , anyway . In a way , he would be unhappy when the leaves did open . In their absence , bright sunlight spilled through the thin upper branches , pouring down with gentle warmth , and he stretched out on his belly with a sigh of pleasure . He folded his true-hands under his chin and settled himself for a long wait . Scouts learned early to be patient . If they needed help with that lesson , there were teachers enough-from falls to hungry death fangs-to drive it home . Climbs Quickly had never needed such instruction , which , even more than his relationship to Sings Truly , was why he was second only to Short Tail , Bright Water Clan 's chief scout ... and why he 'd been chosen to keep watch on these two-legs since their arrival . So now he waited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone living place the two-legs had built in the center of the clearing . Chapter Two " I mean it , Stephanie ! " Richard Harrington said . " I do n't want you wandering off into those woods again without me or your mom along . Is that clear ? " " Oh , Daaaddy- " Stephanie began , only to close her mouth sharply when her father folded his arms . Then the toe of his right foot started tapping the carpet lightly , and her heart sank . This was n't going well at all , and she resented that reflection on her ... negotiating skill almost as much as she resented the restriction she was trying to avoid . She was eleven T-years old , smart , an only child , a daughter , and cute as a button . That gave her certain advantages , and she 'd become an expert at wrapping her father around her finger almost as soon as she could talk . She rather suspected that much of her success came from the fact that he was perfectly willing to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it worked . Unfortunately , her mother had always been a tougher customer ... and even her father was unscrupulously willing to abandon his proper pliancy when he decided the situation justified it . Like now . " We 're not going to discuss this further , " he said with ominous calm . " Just because you have n't seen any hexapumas or peak bears does n't mean they are n't out there . " " But I 've been stuck inside with nothing to do all winter , " she said as reasonably as she could , easily suppressing a twinge of conscience as she neglected to mention snowball fights , cross-country skiing , sleds , and certain other diversions . " I want to go outside and see things ! " " I know you do , honey , " her father said more gently , reaching out to tousle her curly brown hair . " But it 's dangerous out there . This is n't Meyerdahl , you know . " Stephanie rolled her eyes and looked martyred , and his expression showed a flash of regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you really want something to do , why do n't you run into Twin Forks with Mom this afternoon ? " " Because Twin Forks is a complete null , Daddy . " Exasperation colored Stephanie 's reply , even though she knew it was a tactical error . Continues ...
