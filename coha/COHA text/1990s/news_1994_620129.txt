<p> THE WISDOM OF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS <p> Editor  --  Where , oh where , are the loudly self-proclaimed liberal open mind and tolerance ? Certainly not on display here , where we see the derision of other ideas , the disdain for people who said that the country needed change , the arrogance of those who believe that only they can be right , the selective invocation of constitutional issues and the founding fathers not to provide broad perspective , but only to pursue their cause . <p> An impassioned editorial on the constitutional issues underlying school prayer ? Silence on the constitutional issues underlying the retroactive tax increase . <p> Recognizing the extraordinary wisdom of James Madison and other founding fathers in that same impassioned editorial ? Silence on the extraordinary wisdom of James Madison and other founding fathers on other matters about the founding of this country . <p> Such as James Madison 's warning that congressmen make no law which does not operate fully on themselves , and their friends , as well as on the great mass of society , saying that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people together , saying that without it every government degenerates into tyranny . <p> Congress has confirmed the wisdom of the founding fathers and the disconnection between themselves and the people . They show no responsibility , and no accountability for their actions . They put themselves above the public , isolating themselves from the public , isolating themselves from the effects of their own actions , unwilling to stand beside us , unwilling to be part of us , unwilling to personally experience effects of the laws they passed , laws they enacted with such noble words , such bluster ! <p> Decrying the potential for further government intrusion into our lives once the first step is taken ? Is it possible that you do not consider that government has already intruded far too much ? <p> Have you forgotten that James Madison said " We have staked the whole future of the American civilization , not upon the power of government , far from it . We have staked the future . . . upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten Commandments of God . " <p> Well , I had forgotten too . I really do believe James Madison and other founding fathers demonstrated extraordinary wisdom . Do you ? Do you believe that we all need to become reacquainted with the founding fathers , what they had to say about the country they founded and the government they set up for that country , or do you believe that you should invoke them selectively to suit your needs pursuing a cause ? <p> DON STUBBS <p> Mill Valley <p> TROGLODYTES <p> EDitor  --  I sincerely hope the people in the rest of the United States do not believe that all Southerners are ignorant bigots because of recent comments by Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Jesse Helms of North Carolina . <p> These troglodyte-types are the primary reason illiteracy and low intellect are associated with Southerners . We have struggled long and hard to overcome this stereotyping and I fear these sub normal feebleminded morons have set our progress back at least 50 years . <p> I apologize for their imbecilic addlebrained remarks and assure you that not all Southerners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us who still consider being open minded , courteous , having good manners and being patriotic , positive assets . <p> S.C . CASTELLANO <p> Brandon , Fla . <p> ' TREASONOUS TROLL ' <p> Editor  --  Now does everybody finally see the danger inherent in allowing a right-wing nutcake like Jesse Helms to chair the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ? <p> Helms ' Republican apologists , those who say his explicit verbal threat on President Clinton 's safety was " just an off-hand comment , " should be ashamed of this treasonous little troll . Even the most partisan Republican must admit that Helms is at the very least irresponsible and ungracious . After all , Helms ' idea of an apology is to say that he is sorry he made the comment , but is evidently not at all sorry that he meant it . <p> As long as the illustrious senator remains poised on the cutting edge of 13th-century political thought , he should at least keep his baser impulses to himself , particularly on the anniversary of the JFK assassination . " Better to remain silent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt . " <p> MICHAEL A. MARTIN <p> San Francisco <p> MISNOMER OF BOSNIANS <p> Editor  --  The proposed labeling of the inhabitants of Bosnia as " Bosnian Christians " and " Bosnian Pluralists " ( " Labels in the Balkans , " Chronicle , November 14 ) is ridiculous . In the first place , " Bosnian Serb " or " Bosnian Muslim " are misnomers . Both Serbs and Muslims , and Croats live in the same land called Bosnia . Therefore , the only correct " label " for each entity would be Serb Bosnian , Muslim Bosnian and Croat Bosnian . Do we " label " immigrants in the U.S. as " American Vietnamese , " " American Pole , " " American Serb , " etc. , or the other way around ? <p> In the second place , the term " Bosnian Pluralists " could not stand a test of plurality . The Mus lim Bosnian leader , Alija Izetbegovic , blew the notion of plurality the very first day he came to power . He used " plurality " as a catch word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position as the president of the Muslim Bosnia , he turned on the Christian population , Serbs and Croats alike . It is now a law in Muslim Bosnia forbidding marriages with Christian infidels , Serbian songs are banned from public places , Serbian civilians are being persecuted , deprived of food , incarcerated and killed . The survivors are being held hostages in areas under Muslim control . Is that how " Bosnian Pluralists " carry out their " pluralistic " agenda ? <p> DORA SAVANA <p> San Jose <p> FASHION VS . DIPLOMACY <p> Editor  --  I find it unconscionable and tacky that you attacked President Clinton 's recent appearance in a beautiful batik shirt as ill-fitting ( November 18 ) . <p> Instead of emphasizing what you fashion mavens consider a fashion no-no , why not point out the diplomatic gains made instead ? The Suharto government did not want to hear at all about the ongoing oppression and massacre of the people of East Timor . President Clinton did refer to this and for that he has my and other concerned world citizens ' gratitude and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> ELECTION MATH <p> Editor  --  I 'd like to respond to Donald Padgett 's letter ( November 21 ) about the American public " mandating " the Contract on America ( sic intentional ) . Does Mr. Padgett know that only 13 percent of the American public voted for Republican candidates in this last election ? This is because of the exceptionally low voter turnout . <p> Does Mr. Padgett think 13 percent constitutes a mandate ? If so , then he is using the same mathematical formula that Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich have used to justify cutting taxes and increasing spending . <p> GRIER McCURDY <p> San Francisco <p> WACKOS AND GUNS <p> Editor  --  Once again , the Chronicle editorial ( November 17 ) wrongly attacks the NRA and inanimate objects for a wacko 's crime spree . Allow me to let you in on a dirty little secret that may pierce your balloon  --  Ol ' Victor was a constant user of illegal drugs . What silly notion makes you think he would disobey drug laws , but obey gun laws ? The facts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will get it . Pass all the laws you can against the good guys and wackos will still be wacko ! <p> The country has a whole new platform . Why do n't you get with it and surprise us with an editorial on how too easily received disability payments and no work pride helped form a goof-ball ! <p> TED STEPHENS <p> Yorkville ( Mendocino County ) <p> CORNER PHILOSOPHY <p> Editor  --  Whoever dies with the most toys  --  dies ! <p> JENNY HOUSTON <p> Fairfax
