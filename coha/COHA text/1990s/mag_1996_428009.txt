Section : Profile Not every company has to undertake a furious set of high-tech changes to survive <p> Tom Smith Industries Inc . ( TSI ) , a 15-year-old molder of thermoplastic material in Englewood , Ohio , servicing the automotive and other industries , used to be a company trapped by tradition . It enjoyed the benefits but was buffeted by the liabilities of standard operating procedure . <p> On the benefits side , the company could plunk along without much effort , trying to lowball competitors when bidding for molding jobs that came already fully designed and engineered . All the winning bidder had to do was " shoot the parts , " that is , manufacture them in injection-molding machines and ship them . <p> But that passive and reactive approach was sinking the ship . A $2-million company in 1981 , then employing about 40 people in Dayton 's rustbelt , TSI was just scratching by on the lowest of low-margin products  --  like those little plastic cigarette-filter inserts R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. used in its Doral brand . The margins were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be giving its money away . <p> " We ran millions of those things a week , " recalls 61-year-old owner Tom Smith , who bought the company in 1981 , " but they had very little margin . It was as though we were shipping away dollars with the trucks when they went out . " Still , he continued to make those filters for eight more years because " it gave us a little bit of cash flow until we were able to get some other work in . " In those postacquisition years , Smith was carrying 22% interest on his buyout loans ; he needed all the work he could get . <p> At the same time , Smith knew that upgrading the company 's technology  --  to improve how the business was managed and how it developed and produced products  --  would come closer to guaranteeing TSI a future . <p> Smith has a degree in electrical engineering . He knows polymers from his schooling and his years of work in the plastics industry . ( Smith cofounded and then managed Tomco Plastic , in Bryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) He figured that TSI 's salvation would come from the value it could add to products , largely through its engineering expertise . By taking some of the design and engineering burden off its customers , TSI could help them improve their products by converting to plastic where appropriate . Making plastic parts to replace metal ones demands far greater care and precision in the design and manufacturing phases , and is more difficult than producing commodity plastic parts . But it would give TSI a specialty , something to distinguish it from the 15,000 other molding operations across the country at the time . <p> Ultimately Smith realized he had no choice . In 1989 during a state trade mission to Japan and Korea , he had a kind of revelation . In Japan he saw large manufacturers integrating a few chosen suppliers into cohesive , cooperative enterprises . He believed that the model would soon become standard for the large U.S. manufacturers he served . When it did , he wanted TSI to be among the elect . " I decided that if we wanted to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though we really could n't afford it at the time . " <p> As a first step , Smith decided to use technology to upgrade the company 's internal-management systems . TSI was like many molders : facility-wide tasks  --  job scheduling , for one  --  were handled manually , by moving cards around on a master board . <p> The company 's first foray into computerization , however , ended in disaster . In 1989 TSI tried out an internal-management program called Plastic Advisor , which ran on PCs . But the program did n't mesh with the company 's established business practices : it could not perform certain necessary functions . For instance , the billing department was n't able to factor in price breaks for larger orders ; those still had to be figured manually . And the system was unreliable : " Every time we turned around , we were doing something to fix it , " says Tom Smith Jr. , executive vice-president of sales . <p> The second try worked better . In 1992 Smith brought in an IBM AS/400 computer to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and integrate the company 's major administrative chores . By doing so , TSI positioned itself ahead of its competitors , according to Mike Mucciarone , president of Intrac Systems Inc. , in Erie , Pa. , which supplied the basic MRP package ( Molder 's Office Plus , starting at $6,400 ; 800-944-9625 ) . Mucciarone says that TSI has what fewer than 20% of molders have in business automation . " Most of the plastics companies say they 're using computers , " he says , " but they 're using them only as islands of information . " The program saves a lot of duplicated effort by allowing staff members in different departments  --  billing , production scheduling , shipping  --  to refer to the same order information in the same database . Access to data can be limited when the software is being customized . <p> Now TSI receives customers ' orders on a PC that 's plugged into the outside world and dedicated to electronic data interchange ( EDI ) , an on-line exchange of information with the company 's customers about orders , shipping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AS/400 , the software generates work orders for the manufacturing department , working backward from the ship date . The program sets several processes in motion : raw-materials purchasing , press scheduling , and billing ( once the work is shipped ) . By eliminating human intervention  --  including tasks like redundant data entry and paper passing  --  the system reduces the possibility of error . It even sends out an alert if production falls behind schedule anywhere along the line . <p> Life runs smoother not only between departments but also between the company and its customers . If someone suddenly needs a delivery date moved up , the software not only reworks the schedule but can run simulations to determine how far other orders will be set back by the change . <p> There are still hurdles to clear . For example , TSI 's computer-systems administrator Roger Weller is in the initial stages of linking the PC that takes orders via EDI with the central AS/400 . The connection will allow orders to enter the MRP system automatically . <p> Yet overall , slow and steady is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's possible in this hyperconnected , PC-enabled era , TSI , with its 125 employees , may seem woefully behind the times . The company still operates only eight PCs , and the AS/400 it uses , though popular , is a midrange machine that centralizes computing tasks  --  an approach much maligned by proponents of client-server computing . TSI is far from the sexiest , showiest , most state-of-the-art engineering and manufacturing installation going . <p> But Smith is n't ashamed of that . On the contrary , he 's purposely embarked on the go-slow approach . <p> In fact , TSI has found that waiting until customers have upgraded their computing technology before upgrading its own is not only economical ; it can be good business . For example , TSI 's PCs still run on Windows 3.1 , even in the face of the newer , more capable , and heavily promoted replacements Windows 95 and Windows NT . It turns out that Windows 3.1 , and the software that 's written for it , match what 's being used by the clients with whom TSI exchanges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of older programs that simply would n't work with Windows 95 , " says Weller . " Our customers use them , and it would throw everyone off if we were to change . " <p> And Tom Smith hesitates to demand that his tool designers and machinists  --  who create the high-precision molds used in the company 's injection machines  --  change the way they do things just to accommodate more automation . So the company has been introducing design software and computer-driven metal-cutting tools gradually , letting the company 's craftspeople figure out on their own how they want to use the technology . Right now , TSI 's designers and machinists are using technology to create the rough cuts in the mold-making process ; they continue to do the precision detail work by hand . And Smith stands completely behind them . <p> For instance , about a year ago TSI installed its first **27;3862;TOOLONG ( CNC ) machine tool , a tool that cuts each mold component according to a computer program  --  one program per component . Each program is created by one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CAM ) software . TSI uses a package called SurfCAM , from Surfware Inc. , in Westlake Village , Calif . ( The price ranges from $2,500 to $17,500 ; 800-787-3927 . ) <p> Toolmaker Rick Bruner admits , " When we first got it , I just took a side interest in it . " Now his interest , and that of his colleagues , has grown to the point where TSI is ready to sidle to the next step : building a full-blown machining center that will use a highly versatile CNC machine tool requiring almost no human intervention . With features like the ability to change cutting heads automatically , a machining center can be programmed to run around the clock . <p> BUT PERHAPS the greatest contribution technology has made to TSI is helping the company go after its chosen niche : that is , converting metal parts to plastic alternatives . <p> TSI actually started courting that business in its precomputer days . In 1986 it converted a new metal diaphragm-pump design to a plastic model for a company called ARO ( now a division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it could get out of its processes and recognizing ARO 's urgent need to come up with a lower-cost pump , Smith reworked a die-cast metal model into an all-plastic version that dominates its market segment today , according to Nick Kozumplik , senior development engineer at ARO . According to Smith Jr. , the pump , which has medical , chemical , and industrial applications , saved ARO about $1 million in tooling funds . <p> But by 1989 it was clear to Smith that creating product designs with pen and ink on a drafting table was too slow . Worse yet , that old-fashioned process did n't allow TSI to participate in the design process with its customers , who were increasingly well versed in computerized design and engineering . So Smith went shopping for a computer-aided design ( CAD ) package and in a no-turning-back , lock-the-door-behind-me gesture , dropped the cigarette-filter business . " I went to R. J. Reynolds and said , ' You 've got to find another molder ; this is really not our type of business . ' " <p> Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job-share , TSI still uses its first choice for CAD : AutoCAD , designware from Autodesk Inc. , in San Rafael , Calif . ( CD-ROM : $3,750 ; disk : $3,995 ; 800-964-6432 ) . Because it runs on PCs rather than on higher-powered workstations , both the AutoCAD software and the hardware to operate it generally require a lower investment in time and money than other CAD programs . Ease of use was Smith 's number-one criterion in originally selecting the software : " You do n't have to be a Ph.D . to run the thing . " <p> The conversion to technology , delayed as it might have been , has paid off . Smith has locked up a supplier partnership with Goodyear Tire &; Rubber Co. ' s Air Spring Division , in Green , Ohio , which makes the balloonlike cushions that soften the ride for big trucks . ( Air springs are actually the next step in shock absorbers  --  air and plastic replacing metal altogether . ) TSI 's contribution : the cake-size plastic drum parts that are key components in air-spring assemblies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in designing the parts , which formerly were made from machined aluminum . <p> Today TSI is running at 85% capacity . Sales are up tenfold from 1981 , to $20 million , largely because the company 's technological growth has led to more exclusive work for both Ingersoll-Rand and the automobile industry . ( TSI 's customer list now includes Toyota , Nissan , Chrysler , Ford , and GM . ) <p> The 70,000-square-foot facility TSI built only two years ago already has three shifts of 20 injection-molding machines working five days a week . And the tool shop where metalworkers sculpt the molds for those 20 machines are on 12-hour days . So Smith is shopping for an acquisition . " The companies we 're looking at would double our capacity almost immediately , and we 'd use it , " he says . " My biggest dilemma now is do I manage the growth , or do I slow it down ?
