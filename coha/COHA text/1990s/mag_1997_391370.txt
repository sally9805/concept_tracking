Recent incidents of young mothers concealing their pregnancies and killing their newborns raise the criminaljustice questionare these cases of temporary insanity or pure evil ? Here , forensic psychologist Barbara Kirwin , Ph.D. , fights to avenge one innocent baby 's hideous death . Photograph Remorseless murder : Stephanie never expressed regret or grief . // * 1ecember er 17 , 1990 , was the last Monday of the fall semester at Long Island , New York 's C. W. Post College . At 6 : ( Hl A.M. , Jeannette Lopez was studying for exams in the donn study hall when 20year-old junior Stephanie Wernick asked to borrow a tampon . Jeannette brought the tampon to the donn bathroom and handed it to Steph , " ie under the stall door . Stephanie complained that she had never had such a heavy pei ( xl lief()re . Jeannette offered to walk Stephanie back to her room , but Stephanie declinedshe wanted to stay in the bathroom for a while . An Infant 's Cry Twenty minutes later , leaving the study hall , Jeannette met a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the women 's bathroom-and then a short wail that sounded like a hal ) y 's cry . Both girls ran to the bathroom to find Stephanie still locked in the stall , her feet and the floor around her covered with blood .. Panicked , the two girls ran down to Stephanie'sroomm and woke up her roommate , Jody Klein . Jody went to check on Stephanie 's , who insisted she was all right and told Jody to go hack to the room . Ten minutes later , Jody returned to the bathroom with a towel , soap , and sanitary napkins . Stephanie asked her to leave them on the sink ; she was going to take a shower . As Jody turned to go , Stephanie asked , almost as an afterthought , " Oh , can you throw out my clothes ? They 're all bloody . They 're in that pl:istic bag outside . " When Stephanie finally retuned to her room , she sec seemed woozy butdid n't want to go to the hospital-she said she was just tired . At about eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbage room , a custodian found the plastic bag that Jody had left there with a bloody towel on top of it . He called a second custodian , who opened the bag . Inside was an infant boy . The custodians called campus security and the police , who transported the infant to North Shore University Hospital . There , emnegency-roon doctors used forceps to remove several clumps of toilet tissue that had been wedged into the child 's throat . Within an hour of his birth , Baby Boy Wernick was prpnounced dead . Cause of death : asphyxia by obstruction of airwvay with foreign matter ( paper ) . Manner of death : homicide . . Photograph // Cold Confession At 9:00 Stephanie was awakened by a university safety officer , who asked her about the morning 's events . Pale and agitated , Stephanie denied that she has been pregnant . When Plezia arrived and insisted on transporting her to the hospital , Stephanie became combative . Police Detective Robert Ryder arrived to find Stephanie on the telephone talking to her father , planning to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that she ambulance on the way to the hospital , Stephan that morning . " I pulled confessed to Plezia that she had delivered the baby in the bathroom that morning . " I pulled on the cord until it came apart , " she said , " then wrapped it in a towel . I cleaned myself up , then took a shower , When I finished , the baby was gone . " " I went back to bed to go to sleep , " she added , then concluded simply , as if by way of explanation : " I bled every month . I did n't know I was pregnant . " Stephanie was released on bail and sent by her family to a private facility in New Jersey for psychiatric evaluation . Seventeen days after suffocating her baby , she was discharged with one of the mildest possible diagnoses : " adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct . " The courts were not so dismissive . On June 3 , 1991 , Stephanie was charged with first-degree manslaughter Interview With a Killer The only legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tepid psychiatric diagnosis she had been given , her attorney faced a major challenge in building his argument . After her indictment , at her attorneys insistence , Stephanie was seen weekly by first one and then a second psychiatrist . Awaiting trial for more than two years , Stephanie settled into a normal routine . She enrolled in Montclair State College , worked parttime as a waitress , and began a long-distance romance with a man in Auburn , New York , who knew nothing about what she called her " legal troubles . " One afternoon in April 1993 , I received a call from Nassau County prosecutor George Peck , who described to me the details of the Wernick case . As a forensic psychologist , I am often called upon by prosecutors to explore the tortured minds behind crime . Through trained observation , interviews , and psychological tests , I cull the killers who have no inkling of the wrongfulness of their crime from those who know exactly what they have done . In other words , I try to separate the mad from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the insanity defense . Photograph DEADLY DEFENDANT : WHY DID STEPHANIE SUFFOCATE HER NEWBORN ? // But Peck believed that Stephanie lew what she wis doing when she killed her baby , that she wiLs not suffering from any mental illness . If my assessment of Stephanie supported his case , my testimony could help convince the jury that Stephanie had not " just snapped Four years-s earlier , I had testified unsuccessfiuly for the prosecution in the case of Ann Green , who had suffocated two of her infant children and had been caught trying to suffocate a third . My examination of Green showed that she was childish mid selfish but not mentally ill . Her attorney concocted a postpartum depression defense . Green was was acquitted by reason of insanity , sent to a secure mental facility , and released within weeks . I was still haunted by the specter of Green hovering over her infinfants'bodies and beating the rap . Stephanie came to my office for her initial examination on April 16 , 1993 , A petite young woman with dark , wavy hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and would not tolerate inconvenience or discomfort , Throughout the meeting , she complained about the heat in the office , the sound coming through the walls , the glare from the desk lamp , and the place where prosecutor George Peck , who was present for the session , was sitting . When she realized that it was in her best interest to get the exam over with , she completed the first 366 questions of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ( the most widely administered standardized psychological test ) in less than 45 minites , less than half the average time . Stephanie 's test scores showed no mental illness , no depression , no thought disorder , no nothing- an absolutely unremarkable profile . Surely that very normality and the incomprehensibility of her crime would be the essence of her defen.se strategy : Someone so nom-lal must have suffered a bout of temporary insanity to commit such a heinous act . I would try to counter that strategy by exploring how Stephanie 's character and background may have led her to murder . All-American Girl or Psychopath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in New Jersey in 1970 , joining two older brothers . Mr. Wernick was an accountant with a successful private practice : Mrs. Wernick was a homemaker . The twins hav never grown very close . Stephanie did n't remember many detauks about her childhood . Nor did Mrs. Wernick , although she recalled that Stephanie had never appeared as " sensitive or scholarly " as Tracy . Mr. Wernick would yellat Stephanie about her poor grades and ground her , but his punishments were never enforced . When Stephanie entered college in 1988 , whe quickly made friends and adapted to dorm life . She got drunk one or twice , experimented with marijuaan , and dated casually . She had sex for the first time when she was a sophomore , with a young man named Dave . She tole me she had " just drifted into having intercourse with hime . " When the spring term ended , so did the relationship - Steph - anie went home to New Jersey for the summer/ rpobably two months pregnant by then , and never saw Dave again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , a profile of Stephanie 's personality began to emerge . She was , I came to believe , a manipulative , narcisistic young woman with impressive ego strength , resilience , and an unusual capacity to face ordeals . Stephanie claimed to have a scrupulous conscience . But she had , in fact , moved forward very little from the normal selfcentered orientation of early childhood . Although she would be histrionically tearful at times ( especially in front of cameras in the courtroom ) , she never once expressed regret for her actions or grief for her baby . Stephanie 's consistent theme was the effect of the murder rap on her . The morning she delivered her baby , Stephanie displayed the quintessential one-track mind . She cut the cord , silenced the child 's cries forever by systematically ramming wadded toilet paper down his throat , relegated his disposal to her friend Jody , showered , and went back to bed . She was intent on taking her exams and completing the semester . I doubt that Stephanie herself understood her own motivations  --  or ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traits that characterize the true psychopath . Mercifully , what Stephanie did was not nonnal-iit she was not in the grip of mental illness either What was al ) nonnal was the way she chose to behave . Although most of its are self-interested , we eventually- get around to considering another son 's point of view . Psychiatrist and minister M. Scott Peck has written that people who act evilly reflect aT " narcissism so total that they seem to lack , in whole or in part , this capacity , for empathy " Psychopathy is not a mental illness but a glo ) al attitude of selfishness that ultimately lea ( ls to exploitation and the inflicting of pain on others in order to get one 's own lily In essence , exil Most psycopaths could pass its normal people , with jobs , relationships , and manageable lives . But in character psychopaths do differ from the nni they ale more selfish thian most people , highly absorbed with securing the primitive comforts of life . They do not live according to accepted moral or bewhavioral standards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of entitlement . why do psychopaths committ crimes ? Very simply , because they can . Dismantling the Defense My testimony in the trial of Stephanie Wermick began in Mineola , New York , on a warm day in October 1993 . The prosecution had presented its case , then the jury heard testimony from defense psychiatric experts and character Witnesses . Now it was time to mount the psychological rebuttal , and I was center stage . Photograph Her consistent theme was the effect of the murder rap on her . // Rather than postpartum depression ( a common defense in neonaticide cases ) , the defense hinged on the claim that Stephanie suffered from a brief reactive psychosis . The DSM-III-R , the standard psychiatric diagnosticmanual at the time , described this condition as a " sudden onset of psychotic symptoms of at least a few house but no more than a month 's duration , usually occurring after someone has Ien subjected to a major stress ) r or traina . " In my entire career as a psychologist , Ihavenever seen anyone diagnosed with brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un instanity defense . ( The diagnosis was officially dropped from the new edition of the DSM in 1994 . ) I knew that the jury , eager for an explanation of Stephanie 's sad crime , would find the brief reactive psychosis diagnosis persuasive . But is I tried to explain in court , when she murdered her hal ) y , Stephanie s behavior did not match the requirements for the diagnosis , which include rapid emotional shifts , overwhelming confusion and inarticulate speech . On the morning she killed her baby , Stephanie wv as call and deliberate . As George Peck questioned me , I reiterated my findings : There was no dedence of mental illness that I could detect , now or at the time of the incident . Fatal Narcissism I described to the court the childish , selfcentered traits of the narcissistic personality . I noted that nowhere in the voluminous records reviewed for this trial or in her hours of examinations with me did Stephanie ever express grief for the infant or remorse over hov heractionshadaf fected others . Within hours of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reorded as " I 'm so frightened , what it 's going to become of me ? " During a recess , I got in the elevator with Peck , who had a large cart with elidence , including the bloody towel in which the infant had been wrapped . I could n't look at it Stephanie 's father and grandfather were also in the elevator I overheard one Mr Wernick ask the other , " Shall we get corned beef or pastrami ? " Stephanie Wermick was convicted of criminally negligent homicide on October 15 , 1993 , but remained free on appeal for three years Fintly in 1996 , six years after she rammed toilet paper down her newbon 's thorat , the court of appeals upheld her conviction . Stephanie began serving her prison sentence of one and one-tid to four years last December . Although her landmark conviction was a step toward ending the courts customary leniency in neonaticide cases , my hope is that families and shcools can now work to prevent these crimes , not just punish them . // TEENAGE WASTELAND WHY ARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?
