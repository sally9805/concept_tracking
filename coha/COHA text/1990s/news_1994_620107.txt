<p> SEX IN AMERICA IS ALL SMOKE AND MIRRORS <p> Editor  --  I ca n't believe everyone 's zeal to frantically compare their sexual frequency , prowess and fantasies with the new sex study from the University of Chicago ( " Sex in America  --  How It All Adds Up , " Chronicle , October 11 ) . Besides the fact that the subtlety of our sexual natures will never be accurately captured in standard deviation techniques , there are more obvious problems here . <p> So Americans are much more faithful to their spouses than Kinsey , Hite and countless other researchers have repeatedly found ? Could it have anything to do with the study 's face-to-face interviews with the subject 's name and address filled in on the questionnaire ? Are we to believe that the man who 's kept his affair secret from his wife for years is going to finally spill the beans to some grad student with a clipboard ? <p> And the homosexuality figures are a joke . Take this one : percentage of people in rural areas that said they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 0 percent . How do these researchers explain that there is n't a single lesbian in Iowa ? Is there an angel committee that makes geographic assignments before birth ? ( " Oh , this little guy 's gon na be fond of fashion , better send him to San Francisco , " or , " OK Suzie , you can rope steer and wear spurs until you 're 18 , but then you have to promise to move from Podunk to Provincetown . " ) <p> Perhaps it excites you to find that converting from mainstream Protestant to atheist doubles your chances of having lots of sex , or maybe you 're OK because thousands of people have n't had any sex at all in the last year . But it 's all smoke and mirrors , folks . The mysteries of the heart and the heat will never be revealed in the numbers . <p> LORI SALTZMAN <p> Mill Valley <p> . <p> BURYING THE NEWS <p> Editor  --  I noted with interest that the general secretary of the international police organization , INTERPOL , recently came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 13 ) . I noted with dismay that you relegated the story to a tiny space at the bottom of page A13 . In fact , this important news item received one-eighth of the space you allocated in that issue to O.J. Simpson 's jury selection . <p> It is ironic that while your weekly competitor , the Bay Guardian , last week devoted its cover story to the social and monetary costs of drug prohibition in San Francisco , The Chronicle chose to give the INTERPOL story such cursory treatment . I think a priority shift amongst your news editors is in order . <p> STEVE BAUGHMAN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> A NEW OLD APPROACH <p> Editor  --  I think that Huffington represents a new political awareness on the part of the rich . They have discovered that they can apply to politics the old capitalist money-saving maneuver called " cutting out the middleman . " Instead of paying lobbyists to petition legislators , they can just buy the Senate seat once and for all , and be done with it . <p> In Rome , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest bidder . Ah , history . . . <p> KAUSALYA <p> San Anselmo <p> . <p> FAIR GAME <p> EDITor  --  Let 's get one thing straight . The spouse of a political candidate is fair game for criticism the moment he or she joins the can didate on the campaign trail . The comparison to the role of a policeman 's wife is spurious unless she campaigns to obtain her husband a job  --  and when that happens , she definitely is the subject of gossip . This rule applies to everyone from Barbara Bush to Tipper Gore , Hillary Clinton , and yes , Huffington 's " better half . " What one should pay attention to is not the criticism , but the content of that criticism . But then , Huffington 's campaign has no real content . Perhaps that 's why wifey is subjected to such scrutiny . <p> CAROL TARLEN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ONE MAN 'S VOTE <p> Editor  --  In the argument against Proposition 186 in my voter 's pamphlet it 's stated that a married couple , filing jointly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in California income tax if Prop . 186 passes . Since I 'm an average guy who comes close to that description ( wife , mortgage , no kids ) , I thought I 'd do the math . <p> I paid $ 412 in California state income tax in 1993 . Multiply that by 2.29 , carry the one . . . it comes to $ 943.48 . I paid $ 270 per month for our health insurance . Let 's see , times 12 , carry the one . . . it comes to $ 3,240 per year . <p> $ 3,240 minus $ 943 . Looks like I 'll save $ 2,297 if I vote yes on 186 . Kind of a no-brainer if you ask me . <p> DOUG BARNETT <p> Napa <p> . <p> GREEK DISPLEASURE <p> Editor  --  I have written at least four times regarding the Chron 's anti-Greek biases which seem to appear too often . This letter will probably not be printed as the previous four , but at least I will vent my displeasure . <p> I heartily concur with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note above , this is not the first time The Chronicle ( Voice of the West ? ! ) has made fun of , criticized , or ridiculed Greeks ( Americans ! ) . Phil Frank 's " Farley " cartoon has done the same by criticizing a Greek ( American ! ) last year who was running for the office of mayor of San Francisco . And , by the way , one of the best San Francisco mayors was a Greek ( American ! ) by the name of George Christopher . There have been other criticisms regarding funding of political candidates who are Greek ( Americans ! ) . Is The Chronicle implying that candidates of other so-called ethnic persuasions do not get funding when running for political office ? ! <p> For a so-called " liberal " newspaper , your biases and criticisms are intolerable . As far as I am concerned , the " Voice of the West " speaks with " forked tongue "  --  to which I will no longer listen . <p> OLGA KALLOS <p> a Greek ( American ! ) <p> Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a new trend in San Francisco 's neighborhoods : an apartment dweller decides to throw a bash for 50 to 100 people and he hires four or five valets in white coveralls to park guest cars . Unfortunately , the only available parking is in the driveways of neighbors or to double park . <p> Last Saturday night there was a bash in my neighborhood and I discovered two cars in my drive . The valets had not asked my permission and were n't interested in moving them . I called City Parking Department to ticket and tow . When an officer arrived 45 minutes later , a lissome female valet ( valette ? ) sprinted across the street , spoke hurriedly to the officer and drove off , double parking at the corner , which did not concern the officer . <p> I could n't believe the officer let her off without a ticket ! But I was soon told the department 's policy was never to tow or to write a ticket if the owner suddenly arrives . It mattered not a whit that the officer knew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 45 minutes . On the phone the supervisor flippantly told me , " Sure you can write to the mayor , " and I wonder if this supervisor was mere overbloat at a time when we are supposedly scratching for budgetary dollars . <p> HARLAN G. KOCH <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> HOW CAN THEY ? <p> Editor  --  How can San Francisco city officials even consider spending money to upgrade Candlestick Park when our streets and neighborhoods are still blighted with litter , graffiti and handbills ? <p> RICK E. THURBER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ' NEW-NEW MATH ' <p> Editor  --  I read in your editorial that Berkeley High has an " impressive demographic mix : 38 percent white , 35 percent black , 22 percent Asian and 9 percent Latino . " That adds up to a truly impressive 104 percent . <p> Maybe it 's that extra 4 percent that 's to blame for all the disharmony there . Better commission a study to take a look . <p> MARK TEUFEL <p> Oakland <p> . <p> HOW TO SPEND THE MONEY <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 11 ) , here 's my list of top 10 things that could be done with the money spent in the Feinstein-Huffington Senate race : <p> 1 . Build a big , curvy bridge to Hawaii . <p> 2 . Put thick Spam wedges into every earthquake fault . <p> 3 . Pay Hunter S. Thompson 's Seal Rock room service bill . <p> 4 . Build Disney 's Alcatraz ! <p> 5 . Buy a Portuguese charm bracelet for every Californian . <p> 6 . Roll big Buicks down the Mason Street hill . <p> 7 . Cristo does Frisco . <p> 8 . Train Bigfoot to lope a little darn slower , in focus . <p> 9 . See-thru , slo-mo surfboards to ride the fog in . <p> 10 .
