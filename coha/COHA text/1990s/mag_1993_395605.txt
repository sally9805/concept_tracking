When I examined my life a while ago , I realized that I was losing the joy of living . I did n't want to become like so many women of my mother 's generation  --  frustrated , angry and disappointed because their expectations of life and love have been unfulfilled . I did n't want to feel that the only space that we as Black women can inhabit is that space called survival . So I began to look for clues that would help me live and love with more fulfillment , and I rediscovered one of the secrets of loving and living well  --  the capacity to experience the erotic . Erotic pleasure requires an indulgence in the sensual  --  a willingness to take the time to truly enjoy the world around us . But many of us are simply unable to create spaces of pleasure in our lives . If we are too busy or in too much pain , we lose sight of how essential pleasure is to our well-being . True eroticism is not only sexual but rather a fundamental energy that underlies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal world , the seeds of our eroticism would be planted when we were children and would become a moving force propelling us through life . But for many of us , the capacity to be in touch with our sensuality is lost in childhood . If we were raised by strict parents primarily concerned with producing obedient daughters , we learned as little girls that we would be punished for pleasure  --  for not keeping our clothes neat or for any small act of spontaneity that did not coincide with the role our parents had in mind for us . Touching , as a way to experience reality , was often denied many of us as children . Recently I was in a gift shop where a Black child wanted to touch objects  --  to pick them up and look at them the way other customers were doing . But her mother kept insisting that she not touch anything because the people in the store might think she was stealing . There are so many ways in which we suppress our children 's sensual curiosity , and they soon learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember relatives who accused my sister of " touching her children too much , " of making them soft . The belief that our children must learn to be " tough " becomes the reason for denying them forms of physical bonding that tell them that their flesh is lovable and deserves tenderness and care . THE POWER OF TOUCH Many young Black women learn at an early age that their fundamental needs for physical touch and nurturance will only be met sexually . Perhaps there is a connection between early sexual experience , which often leads to teenage pregnancy , and the desire simply to be touched . When Black females have been deprived of emotional nurturance , including touch at an early age , they may not know how to distinguish those longings from sexual desire . They may engage in sexual encounters in an effort to meet needs that are not sexual . How many young Black girls are able to freely discuss with their partner their need to be caressed , touched and held ? Does sex become the only way they can experience touch because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? As adults , how many of us fully acknowledge the healing power of touch ? Are we touched enough ? Many of us were raised to be embarrassed by physical displays of affection . Black women writers often describe growing up in families where there were no physical expressions of care . " If we were sick we were sternly , impersonally and carefully nursed and doctored back to health , " writes Lorraine Hansberry in her autobiography , To Be Young , Gifted and Black . " Fevers , toothaches were attended to with urgency and importance ; one always felt important in my family . Mother came with a tray to your room with the soup and Vicks salve or gave the enemas in a steaming bathroom . But we were not fondled , any of us  --  head held to that breast , fingers about the head  --  until we were grown , all of us , and my father dead . " Too often , it is only when we leave home and return as adults that expressions of love seem possible . What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does the caress embarrass us because it serves as an active reminder that we are flesh and in need of tender loving care ? It should n't surprise us that a people whose bodies have been exploited and objectified should seek to turn their flesh into armor . When we consider the ways in which Black women 's bodies have been used in this society  --  as breeding machines , receptacles for pornographic desires , as " hot pussies " to be bought and sold  --  our estrangement from a life-giving eroticism makes sense . It also explains why so many of us  --  aspiring to be acceptably middle-class  --  become obsessed with perfection in our manner , our clothes and our style . We fear that if we have any visible flaws , we will be seen as failures . Even our makeup is not used to enhance our sensuality but rather to create a screen between us and the world . Where can we celebrate our erotic glory ? Erotic expression is rarely viewed in a positive light in our culture . Many of us were shaped by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can hang out and be wild . For many of us , there is no healthy place where we can let loose . Black women 's fiction often describes brutal destructive expressions of sexuality that mask as desire between men and women ; Black women 's autobiographies rarely mention the realm of the sexual . In hip-hop and R &B,; we hear endless messages that make erotic desire a site for the exchange of goods or the enactment of aggression . Listening to the brutal expression of sexual desire found in much male-centered rap music makes you wonder what kind of sex young people are having and why they connect sex with hostility , violence and even hatred . LOVING OUR FLESH Many of us are still struggling to accept and love our bodies . For some of us , it means learning to love our skin color . Others of us love our Blackness , but mentally mutilate ourselves , cutting our body into desirable and undesirable parts . In Toni Morrison 's novel Beloved , Baby Suggs preaches a prophetic sermon in the midst of nature , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh : " Here , she said , in this here place , we flesh ; flesh that weeps ; laughs ; flesh that dances on bare feet in grass . Love it . Love it hard . Yonder they do not love you , flesh . They despise it . They do n't love your eyes ; they 'd just as soon pick " em out . No more do they love the skin on your back . Yonder they flay it . And , O my people , they do not love your hands . Those they only use , tie , bind , chop off and leave empty . Love your hands ! Love them . Raise them up and kiss them . Touch others with them , pat them together , stroke them on your face " cause they do n't love that either . You got to love it , you ! " Loving and celebrating our flesh includes the eroticism of language , the way we talk to one another . Too often we use harsh tones and raise our voices . We have forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , caresses and delights . Yet much more than standard English , our dialect or patois can be used to bring an aura of pleasure and down-home delight to our intimate encounters . Dialogue is a powerful gesture of love . Caring talk is a sweet communion that deepens our bonds . A sacred sexuality is further expressed when we touch our bodies in daily grooming . One of the truly special moments of tender care giving occurs in Paule Marshall 's Praisesong for the Widow when Rosalie Parvey washes Avey 's soiled body after she has made the difficult crossing to Carriacou . This bathing is ritualistic and healing . It is a celebration of tender care that one woman gives another even though they are strangers . In this sensual space , Avey experiences a reawakening of her senses and feels herself alive again to touch , smell , sound : " She gave herself over then to the music voice and to such simple matters as the mild fragrance of the soap in the air and the lovely sound , like a sudden light " spatter " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time over the water in the galvanized tub . " Shame and homophobia often prevent us from affirming one another and giving physical care . Eradicating homophobia from our communities would allow us to fearlessly embrace one another without regard to sexual preference . Shame and fear also keep us from nurturing ourselves through sensual and sexual touch . To get in touch with our own capacity to feel pleasure with our bodies through masturbation allows us to leap over all of those lies and boundaries that would have us believe that our sexuality exists for someone else 's pleasure . Learning how to please ourselves through masturbation helps us understand that , first and foremost , this body is mine . We must also heal the eroticism we share with one another . The AIDS crisis has heightened our awareness that we can honor our sexual partners most by being open and willingly sharing in words and without fear who we are , what we have experienced and what we want . In her new book of poems , The Love Space Demands ( A Continuing Saga ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what we mean or why we are doing what we do , we ... bring chaos and pain to ourselves and others . " A healing eroticism enables us to assume responsibility for communicating all our concerns whenever we are sexually interested or involved . The poet Audre Lorde once commented on how frightening eroticism is because it is so life-affirming and demands that we resist any dehumanizing encounter . It is dehumanizing for women who really desire protection to submit to sex without condoms . It is also dehumanizing for us to feel compelled to have sex with a partner when it is against our will , when we know that it is dangerous and that we must pretend authentic feeling . That suppression alone is enough to estrange us from our bodies , to alienate us from our needs and to make us lose touch with ourselves . But if we can empower ourselves with a healing eroticism , we can engage in sexual encounters that do not diminish our well-being . RECOVERING EROTIC PASSION As Black women , we are often more passionate in our rage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we bring to situations that arouse our hostility or cause pain can be redirected . Each day we can remind ourselves to direct our most intense feelings to areas of our lives that bring pleasure and delights . One way to do this is to write ourselves recipes for tuning into that erotic part of ourselves . We can put these recipes in a box and when we find our energies moving toward anger or suffering we can pull back , take a recipe from the box and follow it . Singing , dancing , walking or quiet meditation are recipes for bringing us back in touch . This mindful living enables us to heal wounded parts of ourselves . A healing eroticism and a rediscovery of that space called pleasure will give us a more passionate life . Encounters with one another can be places where we can release our fears and come back to ourselves . Creating a union with the natural world awakens our senses and gives us pleasure . We find a healing in involvement with the struggles of our community as we actively engage every aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , beauty , honor , respect and vigilant caretaking . It enables us to expand our possibilities . If you are a Black woman who has chosen to live by herself , it does n't mean that you must be cut off from passion . When we recover a healthy passion , we discover that we can pause in the midst of everyday activities and feel once more a sense of wonder and pleasure that we are flesh , that we are one with the universe and that there is a life force within us charged with an erotic power that can transform and heal our lives . bell hooks , a feminist culture critic , is the author of six books on the politics of race and gender . <p>
