<p> In the 10 months since the accident that took the life of Britain 's Diana , Princess of Wales , much has been made of her reputation as a fashion icon . <p> There was a rush to enshrine her in an international hall of the fashionably famous . Although no such honor exists in reality , in the public consciousness it is as real as the Nobel Peace Prize . <p> In the latter half of this century , such a fashion honor has been awarded to a handful of other notables - Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis , Audrey Hepburn , Marilyn Monroe , Katharine Hepburn , Eva Peron , Princess Grace of Monaco . The mention of each name conjures an instant image . <p> What sets these women apart from the others named annually to New York publicist Eleanor Lambert 's International Best Dressed List ? <p> Basically , these women would have been famous regardless of what they wore . Yet each learned to use clothing to add luster to her aura , becoming a symbol of fashion confidence and independence . Each became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validation . <p> But icons are made , not born . None of these famous women sprang fashionably attired into the international spotlight without first making some major mistakes - unfortunately , not always in the privacy of their own homes , palaces or Hollywood movie lots . <p> On July 1 , Princess Diana 's birthday , the publication of a new book may help us understand how a fashion icon is created , or creates herself , as the case may be . Entitled Dressing Diana ( Welcome Rain , $ 40 ) the book examines her transformation from the almost unknown " Shy Di " and Sloane Ranger to a svelte and stylish beauty , albeit one not known for cutting-edge fashion . <p> With more than 200 pages of photographs by Tim Graham and text by Tamsin Blanchard , the book chronicles Diana 's wardrobe from her first tentative experiments with color , cut and pattern to the bold fashion statements she made almost weekly in the months before her death . <p> The book also takes a look at the details of her wardrobe - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her decolletage ( to show or not to show was endlessly debated in the media ) and her penchant for remaking dresses and hats in order to wear them again . <p> It was Graham who made the photographs of Diana 's dresses sold at Christie 's charity auction shortly before her death , and Graham who photographed her many couturiers , their sketches and finished garments . <p> With unfailing British understatement , author Blanchard resists pointing a sharp finger at mistakes and excesses , such as the early poufed skirts and socks with high heels . But the real story is in the pictures . Graham 's photographs are invaluable eyewitness accounts of the process of one woman 's achievement of fashion maturity . <p> Which begs the question , what is fashion maturity ? <p> Joan Wilson , regional fashion manager for Neiman Marcus stores , said it is a good name for the evolution a woman goes through to realize her own style . <p> " The term ' fashion maturity ' sounds stodgy , " said image consultant Cathy Fitzpatrick . " Diana was never stodgy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion ignorance to fashion icon , but in the beginning her hair was all wrong , and so was her posture . She needed to be refined - elegant and sophisticated . " <p> And , said Fitzpatrick , she knew that she was required to fulfill a royal image . <p> " In the beginning , the clothes wore her , " said style consultant Gayla Silva Bentley , " but as she gained confidence and poise , she wore the clothes . She became the center of attention . " <p> While it sounds simple , identifying one 's personal style can be a difficult and depressing task . The tendency is to fight reality . <p> " It is something that only comes when a person learns what to expect from herself , when she knows her own body , " said Judy Pryor Otto , owner of Pryorities boutique . <p> " In your head , you may think you 're 6 feet tall , but in reality , you 're only 5 foot 3 , " said Otto . " I know . " <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashionably mature woman accepts what she can not change and makes the best of it . But personality also enters in . <p> " You might put on something totally outrageous and look gorgeous in it , " said Otto , " but unless you are comfortable , it 's a mistake . " <p> Even women constantly exposed to the latest fashion trends can suffer from fashion insecurity . <p> " I finally learned that my style was pants , a crew-neck sweater , a jacket and low heels , " said Wilson . " I feel comfortable , I look good , and these are clothes I can work in . " <p> Growing pains <p> As a royal , Princess Diana did not have the luxury of a classics wardrobe . " But whether she was in Africa seeing babies or in New York at an exhibition , she was always elegant , " said Wilson . <p> That elegance was the result of years of trial and error : overly detailed clothes , absurd hats , styles all wrong for her age , too many patterns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diets and exercise regimens to achieve what finally looked easy . And all painfully within the public eye . <p> If there is a lesson in Diana 's fashion transformation , it is this : It takes hard work . <p> Women may have to fight not only the stereotypes that others apply to them , but their own hopes for a look that can never be achieved . <p> Leonard Rutan , owner of Leonard Rutan boutique , said he sees two types of customers . <p> " One type wants to look covered and sophisticated , always with sleeves that come down to at least her elbows , although she might wear something strapless in the evening . The other is so confident of herself she wants to show off her body , to maximize its impact , even at lunch . <p> " One woman , " said Rutan , " wants to take her place in a room without turning heads . The other wants to have all eyes on her . " <p> Diana , said Rutan , crossed the line : " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion icons , he said . " Maybe ( Giorgio ) Armani . Men like his looks , the simple T-shirts under jackets . Maybe Cary Grant . " <p> Rutan said he is amazed at the number of women who are interested in improving the way they look , whether through wardrobe , diet , exercise or even surgery . <p> Not being afraid of making fashion mistakes , said Otto , is one route to deciphering your own style , and for that reason she is much in favor of teens experimenting with fashion . <p> " It 's a really good thing . They are reaching out for something , to make their own niche . It 's never bad not to be a cookie-cutter image of everyone else . " <p> Do women need fashion icons ? <p> " Yes , " said Fitzpatrick , " it 's how they learn . Diana , as an example , had a little bit of something for everyone - clothes , personality , walk , posture . " <p> British subject Christine Lee-Smith , who now lives in Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Most British women seem to dress for the weather instead of for fashion . They never seem to wear enough color . " <p> Diana learned well the lesson of using clothes . <p> For political reasons , she seldom chose the top designers for her wardrobe , even though two of the names at the top of fashion charts these days - John Galliano and Alexander McQueen - were Londoners . Instead , she turned most often to Catherine Walker , Jacques Azagury , Victor Edelstein , Murray Arbeid , milliner Philip Somerville and shoe designer Jimmy Choo for her handmade , size-6 1/2 pumps . <p> Yes , she put the seal of approval on the new quilted Miss Dior tote bag with its dangling gold-toned letters , given to her by Madame Chirac . But most often she carried small , nondescript envelope bags made to match her evening dresses . <p> In the early years , there were the princesslike dresses of Elizabeth and David Emanuel , who designed her wedding gown , and David Sassoon of the house of Bellville Sassoon . She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would later take the young Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones , daughter of Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon , for her first evening dress . <p> After her divorce from Prince Charles , Diana added the slink of an occasional Gianni Versace design ( although not the sexier pinned-together versions worn by Elizabeth Hurley ) . She added the snap of Chanel suits and other designs from Valentino , Emanuel Ungaro , Christian Lacroix , Louis Feraud , Cerrutti and Moschino . <p> How does a woman know when she has achieved fashion maturity ? <p> Wilson said it may be when all the ultratrendy things she would have purchased before become less interesting . <p> As a woman settles into her own style , she is able to accommodate fashion without going overboard , Bentley said . As women around the world were paring down their looks in the ' 90s and gaining confidence , so was Diana . <p> The night of Charles ' interview on BBC television , when he admitted his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles , Diana donned an off-the-shoulder , ruched black chiffon with a neckline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began above her knees and hiked well up one thigh . <p> Was this fashion maturity ,
