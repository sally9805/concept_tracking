freezing January morning at Logan Airport caused the alighting passengers on Air Force Two to wince ? as well they might do anyway , in anticipation of a visit to Democratic Boston in the company of J. Danforth Quayle , Deputy Leader of the Free World . The Vice President was spending one of his increasingly adventurous " days out , " and with little to keep me in Washington ? Congress recessed , the President and his OMB director huddling to scheme how not to cut the defense budget ? I 'd requested permission ( granted late and with reluctance ) to accompany the man who wants to he ? and , more important , could be ? the next president of the United States . As Quayle was borne away from the tarmac on a tide of handlers and Secret Service men , I noticed how his pointless good looks and uncheckable grin already seemed familiar to me ? and . this after only a short flight in his company . A Coast Guard launch swept him across the snowy estuary ( 1 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on St. Alphonsus Street ? where Carol Stuart and her son-to-be , Christopher , were found with the gut-shot Charles , whose lies and suicide had lust reminded Boston about itself , again . I never quire know what conservatives think when they come to neighborhoods like this one , in the heart of deprived Roxbury . Do they see potenChn stopher Hitchens is the Washington editor of Harper 's Magazine . tial enterprise zones ? Do they think they 'll meet blue-collar Democrats to lure ? Do they ever ask what we need an underclass for Anyway , in this case the location of St. Alphonsus Street was coincidental , set up by an advance team well before the Stuart case became a complex , rather than a simple , race problem . Quayle was here to visit Mission Grammar School : Catholic , devoted to traditional values , and celebrating its centennial . Quayle entered a classroom of first-graders and sat , without affectation or embarrassment , on a tiny chair . He talked easily to the children and to their teacher . He secured a press photograph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Benetton . He moved on to a specially called assembly , to which he spoke , without special passion , about " just saying no " and the possibility that the young may live to see the Stars and Stripes hoisted on Mars . The school pastor had made mention , in his opening prayer , of the unborn , but the Vice President made no such mention . The pledge to the flag was made stirringly by all ( 2 ) . The children said that they would enter the Vice President 's name on their " prayer list , " and he seemed to like that ( 3 ) . Then it was off to a GOP fundraiser at the Copley Plaza Hotel . No united colors of Benetton here . Quayle got two standing ovations from the $100-a-plate capacitycrowd , many of whom had paid $500 extra to be photographed with him . Quayle blasted Time magazine for making Gorbachev its man of the decade ; Reagan and Bush , he declared , should have shared that honor . And he invoked the Stuart case ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that they miscued on civil rights in the Sixties and must not do so again ( 4 ) . After this exhortation , greeted with no better than tepid applause , he dashed off to the Union Oyster House to chat with the Boston Police Patrolman 's Association . They presented him with a golfing jacket and pounded him on the back ? more tenderly , I could n't help but think , than their brethren had pounded for weeks on the doors ( and skulls ) of Mission Hill in their " stop and search " hunt for Carol Stuart 's killer . This was the second " payback " visit to the patrolmen from Messrs . Bush and Quayle , who have not forgotten the blow that the cops ' highly visible Republican endorsement dealt to Michael Dukakis on his home turf . The air was clotted with " making nice " and boisterous male bonhomie . Finally to Faneuil Hall , cradle of American liberties , for the swearing-in of GOP moneybags Peter Senopoulos as a new member of the American Battle Monuments Commission . Flags and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once described by James M. Curley , Democratic boss here for half a century , as " invincible in peace , invisible in war . " Quayle spoke throatily of those who made the supreme sacrifice and of his own recent visit to an American war memorial in the Philippines ( 5 ) . It could hardly have subtracted from his joy or his pride that the outgoing ? that is to say , shoved out ? commissioner was one Joseph Canzeri , the very same Joseph Canzeri who told Jack Germond and Jules Witcover , for their book on the ' 88 campaign , that Quayle was " like a kid . Ask him to turn off a light , and by the time he gets to the switch , he 's forgotten what he went for . " ( 6 ) Yet to recall that campaign , and to carefully review my notes 1-6 , is to see that Quayle successfully touched the following bases on his day trip to Boston . He was ( 1 ) ferried in style across Boston Harbor . He took part ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allegiance . He heard himself put on a ' ' prayer list " ( 3 ) without any embarrassing reminiscence about his debate with Lloyd Bentsen , a debate in which he said that were he to become president suddenly ( the heartbeat-away scenario ) , the first thing he would do would be to pray . He dealt cleverly ( 4 ) with the shade of Willie Horton and race and class justice . He managed a sentimental address to veterans ( 5 ) without any awkward bringing-up of his notorious reluctance to shoulder a rifle and pack for Indochina . ( Who now remembers the campaign gag about crossing a hawk and a chicken to get a Quayle ? ) He saw off a minor but irritating political critic ( 6 ) and saw him replaced by a right-wing Massachusetts Greek . I should add that Quayle made no gaffes that day and very few slips in delivery ; that he managed to insert a compassionate reference to Kitty Dukakis 's recent difficulties ; and that he returned to Andrews Air Force Base looking pretty pleased with himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bells and run away . The next day 's Boston Globe carried a long , positive , respectful report on the visit , complete with a large front-pagepicture of the Benetton moment . This experiment in the political exorcism of past crimes and blunders was not the last I witnessed . Later that week , the United States Conference of Mayors convened in the capital ( in the regrettable absence of Marion Barry , whose character and associations were set out in my Letter of last October ) . I happened to be on the telephone with David Beckwith , Quayle 's genial , obstructive press officer , when he dropped the receiver . As he struggled back onto the line , he was gurgling and panting . " Guess who I 've got for you ? " he said . " Art Agnos just dropped by to make up . " I did n't quite believe it , until he actually put the mayor of San Francisco on the line . After all , Quayle 's post-earthquake visit to S. E had generally been accounted one of the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quayle 's photo-op tactics on Nightline and accusing him of getting in the way , and the press snickering as Quayle discovered that the suffering in the Bay Area was " heart-rendering " and that " the loss of life is irreplaceable . " Yet here was Agnos , making a courtesy call and saying that he 'd dropped by , among other things , to make amends for a duel with Beckwith on Larry Ailes and the boys were onto something when they pressed the idea of J. Danforth Quayle on George Herbert Walker Bush ? The liberal press , which has learned less than nothing from its consistent underestimation of first Reagan and then his vice president , continues to miss the point . Reporters and editorialists alike prefer to concentrate only on the Quayle style , the gaffes and embarrassments . As if there were n't enough real flubs , the papers have taken to manufacturing some ? e.g. , the one about Quayle saying he wished he 'd learned Latin in order to get on better with Latin Americans . The difficulty with this shallow journalism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it puts Quayle in a position where he has nowhere to go but upward . As both Reagan and Bush have good cause to know , the latter is not such a bad position to be starting from . And Quayle 's admittedly impressive tomfooleries and fatuities are a bagatelle compared to the lying and boasting of Ronald Reagan or the train-wreck sentences and syntactical miasma of the present incumbent . Which brings us to a third point ? namely , that all may be forgiven of those who make it in the end . A tendency to gaffe and an inability to get on good terms with the language can become part of your likable , human persona if you are in power . The authors of the current Dan Quayle Quiz Book may not yet appreciate the catchpenny favor they are doing their target . A day may come when Middle America makes Quayle 's vulnerabilCAPITAL LETTER 69 ity an occasion for sympathy and affection . It 's been done before . This is not to say that Quayle is any less of an empty vessel than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up close , I saw nothing to suggest that if his brains were made of TNT they would generate enough explosive power to disarrange his hair . And he has the most nervous and protective media staff I have ever encountered . At our first discussion , press boss Beckwith , a Time magazine hack of nearly two decades ' standing , leveled with rue . " I 've got to tell you , Mr. Hitchens , " he said hurriedly , " we 're all a bit gun-shy around here . " The relief that members of the staff displayed when the trip to Boston was over and we were heading for home was touching in its intensity . Quayle 's staff is , in many ways , the most interesting thing about him . To visit the vice presidential floor of the old Executive Office Building is to visit the last ark of the Reagan Revolution , with choice youngish specimens of all the species of 1980s conservative somewhere on board . As chief of staff we discover William Kristol , son of neo-con Irving and a veteran of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Department of Education . Kristol 's secretary , Kathleen Connolly , is the sister of raver Pat Buchanan . Robert Novak 's daughter Zelda is on the research staff Joseph Shattan , formerly an aide to Jeane Kirkpatrick , is a speechwriter . In charge of foreign policy is Carnes Lord , a shell-back conservative and probable disciple of Chicago savant Leo Strauss . If the now dispirited and ambivalent movement calling itself American conservatism has any focus for its teleology in the age of Gorbachev , that hope is located somewhere among the Quayle bestiary as now accoutred and assembled . Note , however , that this right-wing gal ? re represents a qualitative step up for young Danforth . Around the house he has been nurtured not by conservative thought but by barking , irrational , thoughtless quackery . Mom and Dad are faithful Birchers ; Dad has endorsed The National Educator , a magazine in which one can read that while the Democratic party is " firmly committed to the Moscow wing of the Communist Party , " the Republicans are " firmly committed to the Trotskyite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And at home , in the domestic bliss of D.C. , we find the tempestuous Marilyn Quayle , wife , mother , and devotee of the Reverend Colonel Robert Thieme Jr. , a drool-flecked pulpit banger and paranoid separator of fools from money . It 's a wonder Quayle is as calm and reflective as he is . On arriving at the Senate in the great Reagan levee of 1980 , the young Quayle got off to a rough start by granting a lavish interview to Spotlight , published by the Liberty Lobby , which likes to keep an eye on Semitic activity around town ( and internationally ) . He shepherded the nomination of Indiana fruitcake Daniel Manion to a widely ridiculed federal judgeship . Then he hired Robert Owen as a staffer and allowed this lachrymose acolyte to employ his office for crazoid meetings between Oliver North 's private army and various drifters from Central America . It was in the Quayle sanctum that Owen introduced North to John Hull , now under multiple indictment in Costa Rica . This is no longer Quayle 's scene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerical kooks and out of the frazzled Soldier of Fortune milieu . Stuart K. Spencer , the marketing and packaging genius whose consulting firm ran the Quayle vice presidential campaign ( and , more recently , was paid $350,000 to help General Noriega with his intractable image problems ) , was very blunt in a 1988 interview . " Dan Quayle does n't know about cities , " he said . " He does n't know who lives there , ghettos , traffic , race , crime , housing , all of that stuff , but we 'll teach him . " Spencer also said , " First , we had to shut that John Birch father of his up . " It seems to me that in Boston I was shown some evidence of the Spencer effect , and all of us will be seeing more of it . Dan Quayle was no doubt willing after his election to the Senate , complaining that " they are going to be dealing with all those issues like abortion , busing , voting rights , prayers . I 'm not interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from them as I can . " Though he made the obligatory attacks on Senator Edward Kennedy while addressing Boston Republicans , Quayle 's first imprint on the nation 's greatest deliberative body was as cosponsor , with the senior senator from Massachusetts , of the job Training Partnership Act . He may be no Ted Kennedy , but the subliminal association probably did him no damage in the eyes of the professional pols . He is a conservative Republican who always wanted to be part of the governing majority . " Thus the highly polished William Kristol , in a brief and exquisitely careful interview with me . " He was often more liberal than Reagan-he voted to override the veto on South African sanctions and he favored the Martin Luther King holiday . But most conservatives regard him as one of them . " That 's not especially bad strategy if you think about it : Quayle is distancing himself from the Right in consensus terms while retaining his option as their only plausible champion for the next round . Kristol went on to surmise-cleverly , I thought-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where old distinctions within the conservative movement do n't matter anymore , or as much as they did . " Quayle does n't have the baggage that Ronald Reagan was carrying , " Kristol said , on matters like states ' rights and the Vietnam War . The younger conservatives for whom Quayle is being groomed are not going to ask-are not going to care about-where Quayle stood " back then . " This is postmodernism , and this makes the repackaging a good deal easier . I wonder , though , if any handler can train the Vice President to accept the passing of the Cold War . Within the administration and within the Republican party , Quayle hangs as tough as he dares on any question affecting " national security . " And , difference of " tone " or not , he has made it plain that he is nostalgic for the Russia bashing and all that goes with it . Kristol seemed defensive on this point . " The Vice President has been reading William Manchester 's second volume on Winston Churchill , " I was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . He was very struck by Steve 's phrase ' Weimar Russia . ' " Of course I 'm familiar with the idea that all Republicans in a tight corner will reach for their Churchill , and of course CSIS has been indispensable for the Cold War head-bangers of both parties , but I do n't think that Quayle had heard of either Manchester or Sestanovich when he recommended that Tom Clancy be made an adviser to the National Space Council , and I have a journalistic instinct about whose prose has been the more influential . Let us not forget that Quayle 's major stand in the Senate , aside from his " bipartisan " moment with Kennedy , was with the arms lobby in favor of the grandiose AWACS sale , wherein he acted as point man . Or that his first real tooth-cutting as Vice President involved a fight for Senator John Tower , the defense lobby 's faithful executant , in his now forgotten nomination for secretary of defense . These days Quayle 's relationship with the defense establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated by his uplifting cliches about Martian exploration to the trusting children of Mission Hill , he can cloak this relationship in concern for " space . " As head of the National Space Council , he is free to pursue a fantasy ? the fantasy of the Star Wars shield ? that is too embarrassing to be avowed publicly by an administration as timid and surreptitious as this one . His two senior appointments to the council have been Lieutenant Colonel Pete Warden , an underling of Lieutenant General James Abrahamson when the latter ran the Strategic Defense Initiative for Reagan , and Mark Albrecht , a former chief defense aide to SDI fanatic Senator Pete Wilson . With Wilson , then-Senator Quayle helped preserve the idea of interceptors in the outer atmosphere and the evenwilder idea of testing antisatellite weapons . On one occasion , he spoke movingly of the latter on the Senate floor , paying another debt to Tom Clancy ( rather than to Winston Churchill ) by saying that the United States prevailed in Red Storm Rising only because of its antisatellite capacity . On another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the earth was flat , saying , " Eventually we will probably see agreements to establish self-defense zones in space that will actually divide up space between the Soviet Union , the United States , and other nations . If others come within our zones , then in fact they would be in-416 fringing on our territory . A ome within our zones ... " Yet it is not these ludicrous and sinister gaffes that get Quayle his reputation as a clown . Every tired caption- or headline-writer drags out a stale allusion to the Veep 's fondness for golf , but how many stories have you read about Quayle 's role in the " Brilliant Pebbles " proposal ? This little scheme , which involves the seeding of space with thousands of tiny orbiting interceptors , has also been termed " Smart Rocks , " Research and development of " Smart Rocks " is now official administration policy , which makes it less funny ; and the SDI cabal credits Quayle as much as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney with the decision to proceed . The Cold War , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pseudo-scientists even if there is no longer a believable adversary . ( In Bush 's " trimmed " defense budget for 1991 , one finds a proposed 22 percent increase for Star Wars , with almost all the new money ? about $800 million ? pegged for " Smart Rocks . " ) All of which is to say that if the more fierce and senseless bits of the Reagan ? Bush legacy are to be carried through the 1990s , it is likely that Dan Quayle , rather than , for example , Jack Kemp , will be doing the bearing . ( Quayle is not at a loss in space ; Kemp is as earthbound as possible , mired in the sludge of post-Reagan HUD . ) You object , perhaps , that Quayle has no weight , no authorContinued on page 78 Continued from page 75 ity , no power to dispense reassurance or inspiration . No , he does not . But these things can be simulated , as they were for Reagan and for Bush , each rightly considered a joke candidate in his day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parry 's nomination for the presidency . Quayle himself is qualm-free about the prospect , telling the New York Times , " When you get into public life and particularly when you run for the Senate , there are only two offices left : president and vice president . " One has to credit the presumption and sheer gall of someone who can say this when the only smart thing ever associated with his name is a rock ( and that a pebble ) . But by 1996 , if the schedule goes smoothly , Quayle may have been remade and may come before the country as someone no longer an enfant , if still unquestionably terrible .
