<p> In the old days of pharmaceutical research  --  way back in 1985  --  the hunt for new drugs almost always began with classic " cook-and-look " chemistry . That is , each scientist meticulously created a pure batch of a single promising compound , tested it for the desired biological effect and then modified it repeatedly , bit by bit , to see how its activity could be improved . <p> It was a laborious and flask-intensive business that proceeded one compound at a time . " We used to think that an individual chemist could probably make 100 molecules in the course of a year , " said Paul S. Anderson , president of the American Chemical Society . Even with teams of 10 or 20 top staff members focused on the same problem , it routinely took years and many thousands of trial compounds before a lab could isolate the one formulation that , with luck , might reach the stage of being tested on animals . <p> But now , thanks to a conceptual and technological revolution called combinatorial chemistry , each researcher can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstart method , experts suspect , may cut as much as two years from the five to 10 years it typically takes to develop a new drug . <p> No substance identified via combinatorial chemistry has yet been approved for human use . But " every major pharmaceutical company at this point has some effort in this area , " said Jonathan A. Ellman of the University of California at Berkeley , an early pioneer in the field , and " there are multiple compounds which have entered into clinical trials that were at least in part developed by this strategy . " <p> One of them  --  a novel anti-migraine drug  --  came out of Eli Lilly &; Co. , where " we currently are using the technology in over 75 percent of programs we have , across all the therapeutic areas of interest , including cardiovascular , cancer , central nervous system , endocrine and infectious disease research , " said Stephen W. Kaldor , head of combinatorial chemistry . <p> At DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co , where Anderson serves as senior vice president , the technique is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous-system conditions , HIV , Alzheimer 's disease and antibiotic-resistant bacteria , among others . <p> This sudden spasm of interest may seem odd , because combinatorial chemistry is based on an embarrassingly simple low-tech idea : The more compounds a chemist can explore at a time , the greater the probability of finding a useful drug . But it was n't until the mid-1980s that pharmaceutical researchers began to exploit the process originated a few years earlier by protein and gene scientists . Once adopted , it became ubiquitous . Now , instead of concocting candidate formulations one at a time , chemists create tiny quantities of many dozen slightly different variations on a single chemical theme , and test them all simultaneously . <p> Suppose , for example , you want to design a drug to inhibit the action of a certain enzyme . ( Enzymes are strands of protein that act as catalysts for biochemical reactions , some of which are unhealthy . ) You would like your compound to be able to glom onto the enzyme , putting it out of action . <p> You already know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow area near the middle . On one side of the hole is a wad of atoms that looks like it might bind nicely to a hydrophobic ( water-resisting ) configuration . The other side has a cleft that would couple to something acidic . <p> A viable drug that will bind tightly to the enzyme , you assume , will need to have some combination of those two qualities . So you get a plastic tray a bit larger than a deck of cards that has 96 pits or " wells " stamped in it , arranged in an 8-row-by-12-column grid array . Each well holds a microscopic bead of polystyrene  --  the same stuff used for milk containers  --  that will serve as a tiny platform on which chemicals can combine . <p> Across each row , you fill every well with one of eight similar substances that differ only in the shape of their hydrophobic branches . Then down each column you place one of 12 similar compounds that differ only in the length of their acid sections . <p> After a reaction period ranging from minutes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unique compounds , each containing both a hydrophobic branch and an acid section . You then test all of them against the target enzyme , and find out which ( if any ) binds to it . Perhaps one does . If so , you 've now drastically narrowed the range of promising configurations . So you create another plate with 96 variations on your best compound , and so on . Eventually one may bind perfectly . <p> And you 'll use only a few ounces of chemicals . The process entails " about a 200-fold reduction in volume " compared with conventional methods , said Andrew Combs , group leader for combinatorial chemistry at DuPont Merck . ( The compounds of interest have molecular weights below 600  --  the mass equivalent of 20 copper atoms and the approximate upper size limit for substances that can escape mangling by the human digestive system ) . <p> Combinatorial grids can be made by hand . But increasingly the job is done by robotic arms that load plates holding hundreds or thousands of cells each . Other computerized gizmos screen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of the ever-growing compound " libraries " for future reference . <p> Even equipment that can screen 100,000 compounds a week is now nearing obsolescence , said Kevin R. Oldenburg , DuPont Merck 's director of biomolecular screening . The newest , totally automated gear can handle between 300 and 1,000 plates per hour around the clock . And further elaborate technologies are in development . Oldenburg has adapted a bench-top microscope version of a silicon CCD light-detector array built for cutting-edge astronomical telescopes to scan plates containing 9,600 wells , each of which holds only two-tenths of a millionth of a liter . <p> " To be in this field , you really have to be a techno-geek , " he said . " My parents say , ' Tell us what you 're doing . ' And when I do , their eyes glaze over . " <p> It 's too soon to tell what effect combinatorial chemistry will have on the overall pharmaceutical enterprise . " There are people who think you can make universal libraries of a 100,000 compounds or so and they 'll bind every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that 's kind of pie in the sky . " <p> Nor can the strategy shorten the time required for a complete chemical analysis of drug structures or the process of testing them on animals . In addition , Ellman said , it appears to be more challenging for certain kinds of targets , such as protaglandins  --  the hormone-like fatty acids that affect a range of body functions such as temperature , inflammation and blood pressure . <p> " Chemistry , " Ellman said , " is still not easy . " <p> PARALLEL SYNTHESIS <p> This " combinatorial chemistry " method uses a plastic plate resembling a miniature muffin pan . Each of its several dozen pits contains chemically inert plastic beads that act as supports . <p> ACROSS EACH ROW , chemists add samples from a family of molecules ( call it X ) that differ only in small details . <p> DOWN EACH COLUMN , they add variations on a second class of molecules , Y. Thus each pit has a slightly different version of X and Y molecules . <p> AFTER WASHING with a solvent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unique compounds  --  each of which can be tested for the desired biological activity . <p> SPLIT-AND-MIX SYNTHESIS <p> This method makes more compounds than the parallel strategy , left , but individual compounds are harder to identify . At the beginning of the process , each container of beads is partly filled with a slightly different version of the X molecule group . <p> THESE X VARIANTS ARE POOLED in a single container , mixed , and split into equal portions . Then variations on the Y molecule are added to each container , and the process is repeated . Further groups , such as samples of a Z molecule and so forth , can be added if the potential candidate compound requires members of three or more component families . <p> FINALLY , the mixed contents are separated into several different containers for the last time . The contents of each container are exposed to the target substance ( for example , a receptor on the outer surface of a cell ) and tested for average activity . The best batches are isolated , and then chemists begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site . <p> NO MATTER whether the parallel or the split method is used , even the failures are valuable . The results form reactant " libraries " that can be consulted later to see which combinations of molecules appear most ( or least ) promising for various uses . <p> SOURCE : Scientific American
