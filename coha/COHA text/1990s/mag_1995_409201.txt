J.C . Evans ' blue boat was the third of four bass rigs parked on the residential street that cut through the piney woods of north Houston . Each boat was poised on a trailer , and gleamed with metal-flake sparkle in the early-afternoon light . I folded the scribbled directions to Evans ' house , stepped from my vehicle , and headed down his driveway . " Jeez , " I said when I reached him . " I 'm glad you told me what color boat to look for . " A tricked-out bass boat hooked to a new pickup truck is standard-issue in many of the upscale subdivisions of southeast Texas . You do n't have to peer into many two-car garages to and the pointed bow of a cherished rig commandeering the space of a displaced family sedan . This region has a legacy of great public bass water . A trio of reservoirs  --  Toledo Bend , Sam Rayburn , and Lake Livingston  --  has built a level-wind dynasty . So I was mildly shocked when Evans piled my rods and tackle into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Let 's roll . It 's 3 o'clock , perfect timing . Lake Conroe 's waiting ! " Lake Conroe may lack the notoriety of the " big three " of southeast Texas , but the reservoir 's proximity to Houston makes it a popular destination . Houston is the nation 's fourth largest city , give or take a few thousand pickup trucks , and the 21,000-acre reservoir offers legitimate half-day fishing trips for this sizable audience . Conroe is within 50 miles of downtown Houston  --  an easy hour 's drive north on Interstate 45 , perfect for urban anglers able to cast around rush-hour traffic . The other reservoirs are so far removed from Houston 's city limits that they do n't lend themselves easily to day trips . You grow old  --  not to mention dangerously tired  --  trying to jam Rayburn into a single day 's commute . Lake Conroe was impounded in 1973 by damming the West Fork of the San Jacinto River . The reservoir is regulated by the San Jacinto River Authority and , in part , supplies water for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( six with launch ramps ) and three public ramps provide easy access to the lake , and several lodges , resorts , and RV campgrounds are available for those interested in extended visits . Several dozen full-time fishing guides book trips through the various marinas . But easy access is only part of Conroe 's appeal . Florida-strain largemouth bass , channel and blue catfish , black and white crappies , bluegills , hybrid stripers , and white bass are all available here . In addition , last year the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department ( TPWD ) stocked 210,000 striped bass in Conroe , so within a few years the maturing stripers should provide a deep-water option without interfering with the cover-oriented largemouth fishery . The largemouth bass are Conroe 's top draw , and the bass fishing is on a roll . During 1994 , the lake record ( maintained by TPWD ) was broken twice : A 13.45-pound fish , caught December 18 by Randy Dowden , dethroned a 13.5-pounder taken on October 9 by Jerry Bryant . Both anglers live in the greater Houston area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tightened fishing regulations . Conroe 's bass fishing declined during the mid- ' ' 80s , so much so that special efforts were made to bolster the lake 's sagging population . Following a lapse in state stocking activity , TPWD redoubled the program in 1988 . Mike Ray , TPWD 's head of inland fisheries hatcheries , said that Lake Conroe has received seven major largemouth fingerling stockings during the past seven years . The last three stockings ( which occurred in 1991 , 1993 , and 1994 ) each consisted of more than 100,000 fish . In 1993 , to further improve the fishery , TPWD increased Lake Conroe 's minimum size limit on largemouth bass from 14 to 16 inches . The daily limit is still five bass ( the normal statewide limit ) , but catch-and-release fishing is increasingly practiced . As if that were n't enough , during the past seven years the Lake Conroe Marina Association ( LCMA ) has been aggressively backing a privately funded stocking program to supplement the state-issue fish . Wayne Whitehead , of LCMA , said that approximately 150,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high survival rates , the fish were reared for several months in holding ponds and released only after they reached lengths of 6 to 9 inches . Funding for the ongoing LCMA restocking program has been primarily obtained through the KILT/Miller Lite $125,000 Big Bass Tournament , which is held on Lake Conroe each April . The two-day event , which drew 3,280 contestants at $50 per day in 1994 , pays overall and hourly cash prizes for big bass . The contest is a monitored catch-and-release event , and the money raised literally goes back into the lake . The event also publicizes the high-quality bass fishing available within Houston 's shadow . The biggest bass caught during the 1994 event weighed 12.25 pounds , and fish in the 9- and 10-pound class topped several of the hourly weigh-ins . Most Lake Conroe anglers will need more than an hour to catch a trophy bass , but spending a long afternoon on the lake can provide an equally memorable experience . Conroe 's quick draw is its ability to give an urban angler the chance to fit a serious fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sometimes be easier than leaving it . My recent trip with Evans was an example . We launched his boat at 4 P.M. , and by 6 P.M. we had located a Productive cove . Our " up to " fish was pushing 5 pounds ( as in , " We 've caught seven up to 5 ; how about you guys ? " ) . The shadows were growing longer and Evans glanced at his watch . " If we leave in a few minutes , I 'll have time to clean out the boat garage like I promised my wife , and you 'll have time to finish that article you 've been worrying about , " he said . I paused over a dripping crankbait . " Blow it off . Let 's fish . " <p>
