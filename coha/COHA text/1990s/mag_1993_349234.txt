TITLE : NOBODY 'S FOOL <P> AUTHOR : RICHARD RUSSO <P> PUBLISHER : RANDOM HOUSE ; 549 PAGES ; $23 <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : The author takes a genial , if predictable , view of a decaying Main Street and its farcical inhabitants . <P> Half the truth about small towns , much sentimentalized now that three-level regional malls with indoor waterfalls have replaced the towns as economic centers , is that they were wonderful , warm places where even the local drunk was part of the patchwork and where attention was paid . That 's the genial view taken by novelist Richard Russo in The Risk Pool , Mohawk and his new book Nobody 's Fool , three funny , loose-jointed yarns about backwater burgs in upstate New York . Doubtless it is contrary to recall the rest of the truth , which is that small towns were rigidly small-minded . That was the engine that drove American literature for several generations , as exasperated young writers , fed up with Main Street hypocrisy , lit out for Chicago or New York City . <P> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embitter these days . Russo 's characters in the fictional town of North Bath , not far from the Vermont border , are rueful losers who , late in middle age , have known one another since grade school . They were n't all that bright then , and they do n't expect much of one another now . Improvisation least of all ; after several decades on adjacent bar stools , they can say one another 's lines . <P> Nothing changes in North Bath . This is true not just of the town 's continuing decay but also of the author 's approach to character , which is that of commedia dell'arte . He assigns an easily recognizable peculiarity to each actor in his masque , who then exhibits his oddity whenever he is in view . <P> This means that the book 's action is comfortingly predictable . Sleazy Clive Jr. , the conniving savings and loan president , will try to get his 80-year-old mother Miss Beryl to sign over her house to him , but since Miss Beryl 's role is to be the Smartest Person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sully , a 60-year-old handyman with a bad knee , will enact Good Guy Without a Grain of Sense . Sully 's sidekick Rub plays Loyal Shortie with the Brain of a Beagle . The lawyer Wirf , representing Sully in a workmen 's comp case , will remain Drunk &; Useless but a Pal . <P> This is not realistic fiction ; it 's Glocca Morra with a boarded-up main street . Or maybe Yoknapatawpha lite . At its thinnest it seems more jokey than funny . Occasionally , it threatens to become patronizing . Most of the time it works , however , not so much because the author keeps things stirred up but because he persuades the reader to share his great , openhearted fondness for his ridiculous characters . A compact is signed , Russo saying something like , " O.K. , yeah , Sully 's being a bit of a jerk , but watch what he 's going to do now . . . " Or , " Did you meet Vera the Awful Ex-Wife ? No ? Well , here she comes . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the same sense of being in a region that has fallen out of time , Russo 's comedies will be compared to William Kennedy 's Albany series , Ironweed , Billy Phelan 's Greatest Game and the rest . For now , Kennedy 's writing is darker and grimmer , and the resemblance is distant . Kennedy shows the skull beneath the skin ; Russo gives us societal desiccation as farce .
