The upper lip has two ridges side by side , forming between them a little gutter from the septum to the mouth . A quoi sert-il ? It must serve to lead the drippings of a runny nose to the mouth , I concluded as a child . <p> What thoughts one has . Is the voice that speaks in your head your own voice ? As you hear it when you speak , or as you try to make it sound to others ? <p> A woman once told me the voice in her head was not her voice . It said her thoughts but it was not her voice , she was quite sure . <p> Once I had three voices . The usual voice ; a second which disagreed in disgust ; and a rare third one , a voice of sickened exasperation which spoke only two words , shut up . <p> Frequently my father 's words are disapproving . When I am on the border of sleep I seem to hear him speak with preternatural clarity . His voice is not as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One sentence only , of preternatural clarity . I ca n't quite make it out , or I am startled more awake and ca n't quite remember it despite its clarity . The experience is like starting at a noise you do n't hear and ca n't identify until afterward . The reaction first and the realization afterward . When you burn yourself , you do n't feel the heat until you 've already jerked back your hand . What is it he says ? Perhaps I only have an impression . something has been said . <p> What would run in your mind if you knew no speech ? What runs in animals ' ? Something  --  they dream , after all . <p> Whose voice did that woman hear if not her own ? She was n't sure . Why could n't it have been hers then ? No , it was not . Of that she was sure . She could n't say what the difference was , how she knew it was n't hers . It was a voice she 'd never heard before . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she feel about it ? It did n't frighten her but she thought it odd . It did n't disturb her or impede her thoughts but it was odd , was n't it ? It had not always been so . <p> At times she 'd pretend the thoughts it spoke were not hers at all , in order to amuse herself , or rather to let it amuse her . In doctors ' waiting rooms . On the ward . <p> Like me she was n't always aware of a voice at all , when busy and so on . And I know that sometimes there are no words at all , though I can not reflect on it . <p> Boredom makes us most aware of our voices . <p> Boredom and solitude . In grammar school when I had a runny nose I 'd try to wipe it unobtrusively with my hand . I did n't carry a handkerchief unless I had a cold , you see , and a runny nose could come unexpectedly . I 'd have to wait until my hand dried before <p> could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand but there were n't so many . One had to raise one 's hand to go to the bathroom for toilet paper . In itself this was humiliating enough , but with a runny nose , much worse , it seemed to me . I think I once coughed up a small handful of phlegm . I may have asked someone discreetly for a handkerchief but he had none , or I may have been too embarrassed to ask . Hard to believe , but I think I remember disposing of it by reswallowing . <p> Left alone I could amuse myself with my own fancies . One never was left alone . I developed a facade of attention which left my mind free to wander , and a mental record/playback which repeated the last sentence of what I was n't listening to if I was abruptly called to the present , but often there was n't enough freedom and I was horribly bored . My crotch would crawl , as it does when the bladder is full and must wait to be emptied . <p> She had dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think . Pleasantly unkempt . Tense and direct . <p> Perhaps I am confusing her with someone else . No . I remember her intensely . <p> I love her for our affinity . No , a dialogue of unlikenesses viewed similarly . Viewed with mutual understanding . Her views stimulated my own which were inspired fondly to proceed in parallel or tangent . <p> Fevers strangely alter the inner voice , amplify it . The inner voice fondly preserves past selves . When it comes to the fore , past selves may be evoked . <p> The woman with the dark hair 's husband died . One morning sometime afterward she awoke happy , she told me . She had forgotten . Within seconds his death came back to her as a sinking of the stomach , which then became an empty space somewhere within her . Finally her thoughts dulled : everything seemed as though without purpose . <p> The reaction first . <p> Her inner voice cast around listlessly for topics but none held any interest . Nevertheless it had to carry on . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for long after , she told me : I wish it were over , I wish it were over . Nothing more . She did n't know what she had meant , what it had meant , but it comforted her , she said , as if she were holding herself in her arms and rocking herself . <p> There were times later when she became angry with him for leaving . Resentful . Her eyes would prick , her throat lump . The corners of her mouth might tremble . <p> The resentment too comforted her , she said . At first ; later it made her feel ill . Nauseated . She felt a kind of disgust , a disgust for the face , the face of resentment that occupied her mind : its wordless stare , the face of a small boy who has been unjustly punished . <p> I have lost no one but I have thought of it often . It is much the same pleasure as imagining your own death . St. Augustine said of drama that men expected it to make them feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As a small boy I feared any excess that people might disapprove , yet with courage I committed many . All children fear extremes , even their food must be bland . I wanted anonymous features  --  nothing too long , too short , or too wide . My most painful feelings came from children 's torment of the striking . <p> Later we are only too happy to be striking . To catch the eyes of others . And merely to be different , unlike all those others , all those others who die . <p> All men are mortal , alle Menschen muessen sterben , my first text in German said . It startled me , where in English it might not have . Startled . Not the right word . The statement impressed itself upon me as the truth . <p> She was distractable . At times it was hard to talk to her . Her mind was on other things . It was unworldliness , except the other things that occupied her were trivial . The difference between distraction and absentmindedness is that the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to Come , the small acts yet to perform . Brushing her hair back with one hand . It bushed forward , again in the way . Her eyes would dart from object to object as her thoughts moved among future acts . Perhaps she bit her lower lip , took the left corner of it between her teeth , or perhaps I only have the impression she did . An actress playing her would bite her lip . What ? she would say to your remark or question , what ? a bit too loudly and too quickly . What ? <p> Were it not for that note of desperation I 'd envy her , envy all those for whom life is too many things to do in too little time . It seems the opposite to me , you see . At the worst times there seems to be nothing to be done and even at the best too little . <p> I said I have never lost anyone so dramatically as she did , by death . My losses are to time . Mine disperse in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog rolls behind me . <p> Yet fogs have always comforted me . Fog and certain secret phrases , incantations I use in desperate circumstances . The words lull . Fogs and myopia soothe . <p> Myopia , Myopia : a Racinean heroine . The sister of Somnos , who knits the raveled sleeve . There are those whose voices tell them puns . ( Myopiate . ) Perhaps on a full stomach . Late at night comes the neoclassic verse . Late at night and in certain states of drunkenness . <p> She told me she had ideas , thoughts , movements in the back of her mind which she could n't put into words . I know things that can not be put into words , she said : I try , but even to me they do n't sound right . <p> I found this hard to understand . I used to understand . I remember thinking myself in some woods , in the pine woods of my childhood , thinking I had thoughts for which I had no words . I almost had words for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did : I knew things for which there are no words . I only think now that I thought the words would come because I know now that they have come . Or I am no longer capable of wordless thoughts . <p> Thoughts are only words to me now . Not merely , there is nothing mere about it . Perhaps I know only words now . What is an idea before it is words ? Nothing . <p> The mot juste . What does that mean ? I ca n't understand what that means anymore , though I think I used to know . One word means one thing and another means another . <p> Often I do n't know what I think about what happens . But it does n't seem to me I do n't know the words for what I feel , but that I do n't know what I feel . When I know , I know the words . <p> It 's true they may not come easily . It 's hard to dredge up the words that become what I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to bind upon them thongs which the things they are about elude . I feel this as if it were irresponsible , an indulgence to content myself with illusory form where there is real chaos . I find it perilous to exchange the real and confused for the clear but false : within me an Augustinian devil , drama , rapes chaste Night to beget Space and Time . <p> Can I feel without knowing the words ? <p> ( I may know the words . ) <p> Yes , it is possible but grows harder . I used to . She said she did  --  I see no reason to doubt . It 's possible but harder all the time . <p> Perhaps thinking was easier for me than her . An easy gestation , a natural birth . But pregnant she felt her foetus a foreign growth , malignant . <p> How hard she lived I can not know . Is it easier to have another 's voice speak one 's thoughts ? <p> You may wonder at this dwelling without progress . This subject obsesses me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an underground cartoonist , saw people as cartoon characters , expressing themselves in thought balloons . Either during his breakdown or always . Himself too , I think . Thought balloons . I understand . During the years Henry Miller wanted more than anything to be a writer  --  he thought in written sentences , fully punctuated , he has written . I have felt those periods . On acid I 've seen my life a cartoon , perhaps by her suggestion . Myself an animal . Each passerby becomes his totem . Miz Beaver 's tail waddles ' hind her apron . But I 've never seen a thought balloon . <p> Her husband died before I knew her , before I could 've met him . Because he wanted something so much then , that is why Miller thinks he used to be happy , though the man he describes could hardly have been happy . It is wonderful to want something . At the time it seems but a hole , but later one remembers it as an end . Realized or unrealized . <p> Objects distressed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to need rearranging , cleaning , repair . She worried about them . <p> I am different . Things have been my consolation . They seem real . However unhappy my mind may imagine me ( or I may be , you see the problem ? ) , soap is still slippery , together with hot water it pleases the hands . <p> I 'd like to hold her now . A body is a thing . It is the only graspable of an unknowable . The most real part , do n't you see , to me it is the person . The soul is only its principles of organization , as Aristotle said . <p> I feel hysterical about these things . Passionate , without there seeming to be an object , without clear expression , principle of organization . The emotion then falls away in an emptiness , without purchase , dies away , a phantasm of the heart . Reaction without realization . After it passes there is nothing and it is hard to say what it was . <p> I feel alone now , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vadiverunt ? Without them it 's hard to know what I think . <p> Where is she now ? I 'd like to talk to her again . I can see her clearly sometimes , not her but movements , movements which are her , brushing back a wing of hair with the back of a hand , perhaps the palm is greasy , over a stove perhaps , cleaning something , eye movements . <p> I remember no pictures , only outlines performing motions , videotape loops . <p> I see her with strange clarity here , often at night . Perhaps her face will come to me in a dream as faces do . It is something to hope for . <p> Motions become words , pictures can not . Words do not exist without a voice but a voice may without words  --  perhaps I ca n't quite hear it or do n't remember them . Words are all the same but voices various . Voices . <p> They multiply . I no longer know which to trust . There is no end to these things , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incantation in the night , a timeless agony of never-ending voices speaking to me over and over words that I do not care about or important words that <p> can not hear . Is there no end to these things ? There is no end to these things . <p>
