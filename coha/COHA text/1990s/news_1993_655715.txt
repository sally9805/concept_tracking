<p> WALLACE STEGNER , the marvelous novelist and historian of the West , once said , " California is America , only more so . " Mr. Stegner was not thinking of economic cycles , but his idea applies to economics . California led the nation through much of the 1970s and 1980s with years of unparalleled economic growth . Now the Golden State leads the nation in the depth and complexity of our country 's economic downturn . In the case of the economy , what happens in California is of more than trivial concern and is more tangible than the prediction of the next change in lifestyle . <p> California accounts for 14 percent of the total output of the US economy . Its economic engine is roughly the size of Great Britain . As the White House has noted , the dramatic lag in the recovery in California has been a key obstacle to consistent national recovery . California is in the midst of its worst recession since the Great Depression . The state 's slump has been deep , prolonged , and concentrated geographically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jobs . The key issue facing the US economy is a jobless " recovery " - that is , an actual recovery in output , but no recovery in jobs . California has lost more than 800,000 jobs since June 1990 . More than 80 percent of these have been in Southern California . California alone has accounted for 40 percent of the job loss in the country during this period , and Los Angeles County has been responsible for 18 percent of total job losses in the US during this period . <p> Why is the California economy struggling ? As with all big questions , there are few simple answers . California 's current difficulties are a mixture of cyclical and structural problems . Defense downsizing began in 1986 and has been accelerating . Contrary to popular perception , the importance of the defense sector to the California economy is no greater than in many other states . In terms of per capita defense dollars received and percentage of workforce in defense related jobs , California ranks only ninth and fifth , respectively , among states , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense dollars received . Defense downsizing is not the leading cause of job loss in the state . Between June 1990 and October 1992 , the state lost 190,000 jobs in nondefense related manufacturing , 196,000 in wholesale and retail trades , 196,000 in construction , and nearly 95,000 in defense-related industries . <p> The data suggests California 's downturn is not just a function of defense cutbacks , but of corporate downsizing , business retention and attraction problems , the hollowing out of urban economies , and the effects of the business cycle . <p> Corporate downsizing , though necessary for the survival of Fortune 500 companies , is nearly as big a problem as defense cutbacks . It is caused by global competition , a rise in employment costs relative to capital costs , technology , and deregulation of many industries . <p> Cost-of-doing-business issues such as workers compensation , litigation , and taxes are of concern to many California businesses . In the past several years , the state has lost a large number of manufacturing businesses and jobs to other states and countries . Business climate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key factors underlying the flight of business out of the state . But all of California 's problems can not be explained via business retention problems alone . No more than 10 percent of the job losses in this state in the past two years have been due to businesses pulling out . <p> If the causes of this prolonged downturn are complex , then clearly the strategies for economic recovery must be diverse and comprehensive . The state needs to build on its strengths . First , as recognized by the Clinton administration and as advocated by those in the industry , it is absolutely essential that the cluster of computer electronics and information industries meet the competitive challenge of a demanding global economy . Some projections show that by the year 2010 nearly one-third of the economic output of the state will be dependent on this sector . The policies proposed by the administration aimed at nurturing this sector are absolutely essential , as are vigorous public/private partnerships such as " Joint Venture/Silicon Valley , " which aims at revitalizing the heart of the nation 's computer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure are the best way to stimulate short-term and mid-term job growth within the state . The construction or refurbishment of basic infrastructure - roads , bridges , airports , transit systems - produces jobs , makes the economy more efficient and will make the state more attractive for the travel industry , a sector that still has tremendous potential . Investments in advanced communications infrastructure , particularly information networks as proposed for the " Smart Bay Area " or " Smart Valley " and pushed by the administration , provide high quality jobs and promise to position the area to compete efficiently in the new century . <p> Investment in education , training , and worker readiness are crucial to California 's social and economic viability . Support and assistance of appropriate job training and worker readiness programs are of critical importance to the state 's future . Expanding the economy via human investment is likely to be a lot more sustainable than concentrating just on expanding the economy via creation of physical capital alone . <p> The research universities and national laboratories are California 's critical assets . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their role in the state 's economic future needs to be fully realized . We must encourage the development of a " manufacturing extension service " based along the lines of the highly successful agricultural extension services associated with land-grant universities . We need to enhance the role of community colleges in economic development activities , including job training for emerging industries and small business development . California could lead the nation in the development of an " education industry cluster " combining education , high technology , and communications . <p> Since most of the job creation in the state will be in small businesses , we need to encourage the growth of business " incubators " including those that develop suppliers for emerging industries . Tax incentives for small businesses that create jobs should be enacted . <p> One promising area of job creation in the state is in the environmental cleanup industry . Enhancement of this industry will have the additional advantage of preserving the state 's natural assets such as parks and recreation areas . This will maintain the attractiveness of the state to workers in high-tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high quality of life . Furthermore , the state 's vital tourism industry also requires maintenance and enhancement of the natural assets of the state . <p> While California is currently beset with many problems and difficulties , let us not forget that the state is still the chief spawning ground for new businesses . According to Fortune magazine , California had 33 percent of America 's fastest-growing companies in the US in 1992 , and a recent Inc. magazine study reported that 23 percent of America 's fastest-growing small companies were also in California last year . California 's many assets , including its world-class universities , entrepreneurship , high- tech leadership , a well diversified economy and its location on the western edge of the dynamic Pacific Rim economies , give it the potential for continued success in the 21st century . It will need very aggressive public and private strategies if that potential for success is to be realized .
