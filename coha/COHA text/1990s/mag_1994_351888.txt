All Tennessee is divided into three parts . To the ordinary historian , they are eastern , middle and western . But that misses all the savor . As Nathan Longfort identifies them , the subdivisions are the Lost State of Franklin , the area in the eastern part of the state that was once part of North Carolina ; Miro , once governed by Spaniards , in the center ; and the Purchase , farther west . Similar distinctions apply to families . On his mother 's side , Longfort is a Virginia- Tennessean , on his father 's , a Carolina-Tennessean . You can tell the difference by whether a person refers to a cabinet as a " cupboard " or a " press . " <P> In the Tennessee Country ( Knopf ; 226 pages ; $21 ) by Peter Taylor , the writer of shrewd , laconic short stories whose previous novel won the Pulitzer Prize , revels in such delineations . He writes of a society grounded in family and memory of the Civil War . Nathan 's father was named for Confederate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own youngest boy the same name . Trudie , Nathan 's mother , was the youngest of the three buoyant , beautiful Tucker sisters , all widowed early , who dominate the hero 's childhood and the first half of this funny , rueful novel of morals and manners . The other figure who keeps recurring and who comes to obsess Nathan is the women 's brooding " outside "  --  or illegitimate  --  cousin , Aubrey Bradshaw . <P> Eventually , Nathan finds out that as a teenager his mother was in love with Aubrey ; in fact he paid court to all three girls . Nathan first becomes aware of him , though , during a train trip carrying the body of Nathan 's grandfather , a U.S. Senator , from Washington to Knoxville . Aubrey was not welcome aboard , and the Tucker sisters , now young matrons , are particularly appalled by his efforts to join the funeral party . The journey is one of Taylor 's best comic set pieces , a deadpan account of how the drunken antics of the male mourners caused a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply disappears , though Nathan believes he sometimes sees him , usually at funerals . The rest of In the Tennessee Country follows Nathan 's adult life . Though Trudie wanted him to become an artist , he settles for being an art historian , and Taylor makes an elegant sketch of the bramble of academic politics . On his retirement , Nathan becomes preoccupied with Aubrey to the degree that his son Brax , who really is a painter , becomes bored and annoyed . It is Brax who finds Aubrey , now a dying ancient , and Brax who chooses finally to follow his path and live far away , independent of his family . <P> One can admire Taylor for the sublime tact of his writing ; no one 's behavior , however bizarre , causes a ripple in Nathan 's gentle but exacting account . The problem lies with Aubrey . He repudiates the Tuckers and the hypocrisy that kept him a true outsider . " Compromise , " he intones . " That 's their rule of life . " And he blames Nathan for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Taylor seems to agree , but the evidence elsewhere is that Nathan lacked the talent to be an artist and that he has dealt honestly with his own work and his family . And it is disappointing not to learn what Aubrey did all those years during his disappearance except gnaw at old wounds . It seems a vague , washy ending for a work that glories in the charm of specificity.
