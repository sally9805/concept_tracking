IT WAS JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT when Graham saw the woman at the bar . Or rather that was when he noticed her ; she had , he realized , been standing there for some time , and his eyes must have picked up her presence repeatedly , but only as another figure in the human swirl around him . She was young and pretty , but that was true of most of the women in the room , and , as far as Graham had noticed , of those attending the convention in general . The con scene had definitely undergone major evolution in that regard in the last decade or two . Either that , Graham reflected sourly , or the advancing middle years had affected his perceptions . That sounded eminently plausible . <p> Be that as it might , the hotel bar had been lined all evening with bright-faced , trim-haunched young women - you were n't supposed to call them " girls " anymore , though if some of the ones drinking here tonight were twenty-one he was H.P. Lovecraft  --  flashing perfect teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of smooth , uniformly tanned skin . Graham had admired them in a vague distant way , as he might have admired the lines of a fast sports car without feeling any real desire to drive it . They seemed almost an alien species ; their reality barely touched his . <p> This one , however , was looking straight at him . <p> There was no doubt about it . She had turned clear around , to stand with her back to the bar , and her gaze was full on Graham . It was hard to read her expression from across the dim and smoky room , but he thought she was smiling . <p> And here she came now , pushing off from the bar with her elbows , moving gracefully through the crowd , holding her drink carefully in front of her with both hands . As she passed , men turned their heads to look one large young fellow in a Klingon costume spilled beer on his lap , watching the motion of her hips , and got a blistering look from the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved in more than one respect , so did quite a few women . <p> But Graham 's primary reaction was to groan silently , and then to raise his drink and down a large and hasty swallow of bourbon . Not now , he thought and wanted to scream , Christ , not now of all times , I knew I should n't have come to this stupid thing  --  <p> " I do n't even want to go to the stupid thing , " he had said , Wednesday morning . " I hate conventions . " <p> " You used to love them , " Margaret reminded him . " You know you did , Keith . We had some good times at the cons . " <p> " That was a different scene . Nowadays- " He shook his head , a little angrily , a lot tiredly . He had n't had much sleep the night before . Or any other night , for longer than he could recall . <p> " It 's not the way it used to be , " he told Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , it 's wall-to-wall Trekkies and role-players and costume freaks . And New Agers , and grown men and women whose lives peaked the first time they saw The Rocky Horror Picture Show- " <p> " Oh , come on . The cons always did attract oddballs and misfits . That was half the fun , was n't it ? And , " she added , " I 'll not mention how a certain elongated young Nebula nominee was dressed the first time a certain promising young illustrator laid eyes on him . " <p> " Sure . " Graham had to grin briefly at the memory . " But no matter how silly we got , there was always the basic premise that this was about certain types of written fiction , and the people who wrote it and read it . Nowadays , half the guests at the average con do n't read at all and do n't see why they should . " <p> He stopped , wondering why he was ranting like this . He sat down in the uncomfortable chair beside Margaret 's bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones through the frighteningly thin covering of flesh . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " But really , I do n't want to go . " <p> " But it 's something you need to do , " she insisted . " You already promised the committee- " <p> " They 'll understand . They know about you . I already explained that I might not be able to make it . " <p> " Bullshit , " she said distinctly . " There 's no reason whatever that you ca n't go . Either I 'll be all right or I wo n't , and if I 'm not there wo n't be anything you or anyone else can do about it . " <p> She raised her head an inch or so from the pillow . " God damn it , Keith , I 'm not going to let you waste any more of your life haunting my bedside . You know what they said - it could happen any time , or I could still be lying here this time next year . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of time to throw away . " <p> Her head fell back ; she breathed deeply for a moment , looking up at the ceiling with pain-widened eyes . Those eyes , Graham thought with a bottomless sorrow , those wonderful violet eyes . Nothing else remained of the Margaret of years past ; her face was now no more than a pallid mask of lined and taut-drawn skin , and beneath the kerchief on her head was only bare scalp where that dense red-brown mane would never grow again . The wasted shape beneath the stiff white hospital sheet was a cruel caricature of the magnificent body Graham remembered . <p> " I 've got this damned hideous thing inside me , and it 's killing me . " Her voice was very weak but her words came out crisply clear . " I 'm not going to let it kill you too . Or let you use it as an excuse for refusing to live . " <p> She turned her head on the pillow , looking at Graham . " Besides , you need this professionally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only half a dozen stories and nothing at all since last winter  --  you 've all but quit , have n't you ? And I suppose that 's natural , it ca n't have been easy for you to write or even think while you had to deal with what 's been happening to me .. . but you 've got to get back to work , and soon . The longer you wait , the harder it 'll be . " <p> She glanced about the hospital room . " And you do need to take care of business . The insurance is n't going to cover all of this . " Her lips pulled back in a crooked smile . " Not to mention what those ghoulish bastards are going to charge for hauling my ashes . " <p> He squeezed his eyes shut . " I wish you would n't say things like that . " <p> " Why not ? " she said . " You may write fantasy , but it 's reality time now . You better learn to deal with it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forearm . " Go to the convention , Keith . It 'll do you good . Consider it a refresher course in having a life , " she said . " God knows you need it . " <p> GRAHAM BLINKED ; his hand jerked slightly , almost spilling his drink . He looked up at the girl - the woman - from the bar , who was now standing on the far side of his table , one hand resting on the back of the other chair . <p> " Hello , " she said . <p> Not , " Hi , " Graham noticed , but a genuine hello ; give her a point there , anyway . He saw now that she was even prettier than she had looked from across the room : long legs , slender waist , fine-boned features that came very close to qualifying as authentically beautiful - even despite her efforts to spoil them with over-the-top makeup ; her lipstick could have stopped traffic in a Seattle fog . Thick taffy-blond hair hung to her bare tanned shoulders . Quite a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt barely reached below her crotch , while the skimpy matching top exposed many square inches of flat smooth belly and served to advertise , rather than seriously conceal , a really impressive chest . <p> She said , " You 're Keith Graham , are n't you ? I recognized you from the dust-jacket photos . Mind if I sit down ? " <p> A reader ? Have to be reasonably nice , then ; as Margaret always liked to point out , the readers were the ones who paid the rent and kept you from having to get a real job . This one might look like a reject from a Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders tryout , but what the hell . At least she was n't decked out in fake medieval costume , and she did n't appear to be packing any quartz crystals . <p> Hastily , a bit clumsily , he got to his feet , pushing back his own chair and rising to his full rangy six feet three - Big Stoop , Margaret had named him on their first night together , after a character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reaching for the other chair , before he remembered you were n't supposed to do that anymore either . But the blonde did n't object ; in fact she seemed to take the old-fashioned courtesy for granted , and she stepped back and stood waiting while he pulled the chair out for her . " Thanks , " she said , sitting down and setting her drink on the table . " I hope I 'm not bothering you . It 's just that you look as if you could use some company . And I 've really enjoyed your work . " <p> Graham sighed . " Actually , " he said , resuming his seat , " I 'm afraid I 'm not going to be much company to anyone . You see - " <p> " Oh , I know , " she said quickly . " About your wife . I 'm sorry . " <p> Graham frowned . There had been nothing in any of the publications about Margaret 's condition ; she had insisted on that . He said , " How did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from - somebody I know on the committee . Never mind , " she said . " I do n't imagine you want to talk about it . I just wanted you to know that I understand . " <p> Graham was filled with a sudden terrible anger . No you do n't , he shouted inside his head , you understand nothing . How can you understand what it means to love and live with someone for a quarter of a century , until you become almost components of a single whole , and you find yourselves answering each other 's questions before they are asked ? And then to see her body , that you know so well you could find her blind in a crowd of thousands by her private scent alone , turn into a death trap for her splendid brave spirit ; and to stand helplessly while one door of hope after another slams shut in her face ... how , you flawless nitwit , could you possibly understand ? <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said then . " I should n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what it 's like for you . " She picked up her drink and turned it in her hands without tasting it . " I do n't suppose anyone ever really knows what anything is like for anyone else . " <p> Astonished , Graham could only stare at her . She extended a hand across the table . " I 'm Jennifer . " Graham took the hand , which was pleasantly soft and cool . " Jennifer , " he repeated stupidly . Thinking , oh my God . <p> " They 're all Jennifers . Even the ones who are n't named Jennifer . " <p> Thus Margaret , three years ago - was it ? - at the last convention they had attended together . A colleague of long acquaintance , and approximately their age , had just disappeared into an elevator with an edible-looking young fan in buttock-high cutoffs and a Star Wars T-shirt ; and Margaret had remarked that old Roy seemed to have found himself a Jennifer . <p> " You did n't know ? " she said to Graham . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You get a bunch of middle-aged women sitting around dishing , somebody asks what 's happening with so-and-so , somebody else says , Oh , you had n't heard ? Her husband 's got a Jennifer . " ' <p> " A kind of code ? " Graham asked , interested . " Like in a certain type of joke the gay guys are always named Bruce ? " <p> " Something like that . Only it 's not a joke , at least not to the woman whose husband has gone Jennifer-crazy . Never mind booze , gambling , even drugs  --  there 's nothing in the known cosmos that can make a middle-aged man throw all judgment to the winds , trash his own life and those of everyone around him , like a willing barely legal girl . " <p> She looked about the crowded convention floor , which , now Graham noticed , seemed fairly alive with Jennifer material . " I can understand it , " she said . " They are lovely . And I imagine they can do a lot for an older man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . Just when we need to hang on to the men we 've got , when our chances of replacing them are in freefall , we miss no chance to bust your asses . Then we wonder why you run off with the Jennifers . " <p> " I do n't , " Graham pointed out . <p> " No , " Margaret said , laughing , " you do n't , do you ? I may have the only truly monogamous man left on the North American landmass . But that 's just because I keep you too tired to get up to any extramural antics . Come on , Big Stoop . " She pulled him toward the elevators . " You 're starting to look a little too fresh and rested . We 'd better do something about that before a Jennifer gets you . " <p> Graham downed the rest of his bourbon in a single shaky swallow . About to signal to the waitress , he looked at Jennifer . " Anything you want ? " <p> She raised her drink , a horrible-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ooh , " she said , making a face . " Yes , something besides this thing . In fact I think I 'd like to have what you 're having . " <p> " Are you sure ? " Graham asked dubiously . " It 's straight bourbon on the rocks . " <p> " Sounds perfect . Please . " <p> Graham caught the waitress 's eye , pointed to his empty glass , and held up two fingers . The waitress nodded and hurried off through the crowd . Jennifer was looking at her drink . " Looks like some kind of toilet bowl cleaner , does n't it ? " she said . " Tastes like it , too . " <p> " What is it ? " <p> " A blue kamikaze , they call it . I do n't know what 's in it . Somebody bought it for me . " She pushed the drink away . " I wonder who thinks up these weird drinks . " <p> Bored bartenders , according to Margaret . " Bored bartenders , " Graham said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennifer said , " I remember that story of yours about the invisible bartender - " <p> The waitress reappeared with two bourbons . Graham signed for them and stood up . Much as he hated to interrupt - no one had mentioned that story in a long time , and it was one of his favorites  --  certain pressures had become critical . He said , " Excuse me , " and headed for the rear hallway . <p> The men 's room was deserted when he got there , surprising considering the crowd in the bar . But then , as he was finishing up , a familiar nasal bray said , " Well , well . How 's it , Keith my man ? Getting any ? " <p> Graham zipped and turned . Lenny Devlin grinned at him from the doorway , flashing slightly yellow teeth beneath a graying mustache . " Saw you there , " Devlin said , coming in and heading for the urinals , while Graham washed his hands . " Got yourself something young , huh ? " <p> He hunched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow against the wall , and looked over his shoulder at Graham . " So Straight Arrow Graham finally joins the dirty old men 's club . About time , too . Have n't I told you all these years , the cons are where the young pussy is ? Never did understand you guys who brought your wives along . " <p> Graham suppressed a desire to upend the little bastard -a degenerate Munchkin , Margaret had called him - and shove his head into the toilet . He said , " Let it go , Lenny . I 'm not in the mood . " <p> " No ? Then let me have a crack at her . " Devlin 's guffaw filled the confined space . " I tell you , Keith , the biggest breakthrough of my life next to getting the Hugo-was finding out that the young ones are n't just hotter-looking , they 're actually easier to nail . They 're still open , you should pardon the expression , to a little adventure . Like a one-nighter with a noted author . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hit legal drinking age , they start looking for commitments and relationships . Fuck which . " <p> There was no use trying to respond ; the little man 's ego was impenetrable even to direct insult . Graham dried his hands and left , hearing behind him Devlin 's moist laugh and a shout of , " Once more into the breach , Sir Keith ! Give her one for me ! " <p> Re-entering the bar , he looked toward his table , half expecting it to be empty . But Jennifer was still sitting there , hands folded on the table , waiting , evidently , for him . To his faint disgust he found he was very glad to see her ; and he hurried back across the room , trying to ignore the stirrings of an old excitement . <p> Some time later , Jennifer set her empty glass on the table and said , " Enough . It 's getting late . " <p> Graham was amazed to see that it was going on one o'clock . Time , the old wheezer had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to admit that he was having something very close to a good time . <p> Jennifer had turned out to be remarkably good company , and not merely for the obvious reasons . For all her bimbo-Barbie appearance , she clearly had a first-class mind ; she actually spoke English , too , and so far she had not once said " totally " or spiked her sentences with meaningless interjections of " like . " <p> She also possessed a near-encyclopedic knowledge of Graham 's published work . Being in this respect no different from any other author , he took this as a sign of outstanding intellect and taste . <p> With real regret , then , he said , " Calling it a night ? " " Oh , no . " She pushed her chair back and stood up , smoothing the little denim skirt over her golden thighs . " I want to dance . Come on . " <p> There was no dance floor as such , but there was a small , more or less clear area near the back wall where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham said , " I do n't think- " <p> " I do n't want you to think . " Jennifer grasped his hand firmly and tugged . " I just want you to dance with me . " <p> Reluctantly , he got up and followed her . The music was loud and fast and he wondered what he was supposed to do ; but then as they reached the dance area the record ended and a slow tune came on , Billy Joel 's " An Innocent Man . " Jennifer turned to face him and he took her hand and put his right arm lightly about her waist . The top of her head was barely level with his chin . <p> " I have n't done this in a long time , " he confessed , moving his feet tentatively , trying to find the step . <p> " It 's like riding a bicycle , " she said . " Some things you never lose . " <p> " I 've heard that expression all my life , " Graham told her . " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nearly killed myself . " <p> She moved closer and rested her face against his shoulder . His hand at her waist registered the rhythmic sway of her hips . " You 're doing just fine , " she assured him . <p> Her perfume was a little on the heavy side but he inhaled it greedily . " You smell good , " he said after a couple of minutes . <p> " You feel good , " she replied , and emphasized her words with a quick light thrust of her pelvis against him . Then , as his body involuntarily responded , " Oh , my .... " She looked up at him , eyes widening slightly . " My , my . I think I 'm impressed . " <p> Graham felt the blood darken his face . He stopped - the song was almost over anyway - and stepped back , still holding her hand . " I 'm too old to play games , " he said more harshly than he had intended . " What 's happening ? " <p> She tilted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she repeated . " Not much of anything , that I can see . Not at the moment . " <p> Her hand tightened suddenly on his . " What I think is about to happen , though , " she said in a lower voice , " I think we 're about to go up to your room and more or less screw our brains out . Is that all right with you ? " <p> Graham opened his mouth , closed it , and opened it again . The second time he heard himself say , " Why not ? " But up in the room , sitting still fully dressed on the edge of the bed , he said , " I 'm sorry , Jennifer . I really do n't think this is a good idea . " <p> She paused in the middle of the room , barefoot , one hand on the single button of her denim top . " Feeling guilty ? " she asked quietly . " Because of your wife ? " <p> He nodded . She came over and stood before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got to stop thinking that way . How long has it been , now ? " <p> " You mean since- " He had to think . " A couple of years , I guess . Closer to three , really . " <p> " Then do n't you think your wife would understand ? Do n't you think she knows you have needs ? " <p> " That 's what she said , " Graham admitted . " The last time I saw her before leaving for this convention , she said something like that . Said I should go ahead and find someone to take care of my needs . " <p> Actually Margaret 's words had been , " Get out there , Big Stoop , and find yourself a Jennifer . " But there was no way Graham was going to repeat that , let alone explain it , to this one or anyone else . <p> " Then , " Jennifer said , " for God 's sake show her some respect and quit second-guessing her . You do n't have the right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do it with me , do it with somebody else , do it with your right hand or not at all , but do n't lay your own failure of nerve at her feet . She does n't need it right now . " <p> Graham thought it over . " Yes , " he said finally , and nodded . " You 're right . Thanks . " <p> He toed off his shoes without untying them and began unbuttoning his shirt . Jennifer took a couple of backward steps , still facing him , and undid the top and let it slide off her shoulders . She did something at her waist and the skirt dropped to the floor , leaving her standing in tiny , almost transparent powder-blue panties and a lacy little matching bra . <p> Graham 's hands seemed suddenly to belong to someone else . <p> Her eyes on Graham 's face , Jennifer popped the catch between her breasts and slipped out of the bra . There had been no engineering trickery at work ; everything stayed high and firm and full . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hooked her thumbs into the waistband of her panties and eased them down over her flanks . The blond hair proved to be original ; a fine flaxen spray decorated her pubic mound . Her skin fairly glowed in the light from the bedside lamp . <p> " Well ? " she said , and put her hands on her hips . " If you 're too old to play games , you must be old enough to undress yourself . " <p> Hurriedly he got to his feet , shucking out of the shirt and reaching for his belt buckle . Jennifer moved past him and stretched herself luxuriously on the bed . " All right , " she said approvingly , watching , as he got out of his pants . <p> Naked , he stopped beside the bed . " Ah - just remember , it has been a long time . " <p> She laughed , making everything bounce and ripple . " The way it looks from here , " she said pointedly , " it 's definitely been long enough . " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , now . Time to get back on that bike and start pedaling . " <p> Heart hammering , he mounted her . At the first warm sliding contact she clutched at him and shuddered . " See , " she whispered , " you have n't lost it . Have n't lost a thing- " <p> THE REST of the night was a scented blur of couplings and uncouplings , of humpings and pumpings and ridings and bestridings , all over the big bed and then at various locations around the room and even once in the shower . Jennifer was an agile and imaginative partner with , it developed , no inhibitions whatever as to techniques , positions , or orifices . She was also able , somehow , to cause Graham to tap into unsuspected reserves of stamina , so that he found himself doing things he had not dreamed of for decades . <p> Gray light was beginning to filter through the window curtains when Graham finally fell asleep , feeling Jennifer 's breath on his neck and the soft flattening of her breasts against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she was still awake , and he wanted to speak to her , but the thought got away from him and he slipped away into the darkness . <p> When he awoke the room was brightly lit and Jennifer was no longer beside him . He sat up , after a confused moment , and looked around , just as she came padding naked out of the bathroom . <p> " Oh , wow , " she said . " I did n't want to , like , wake you up . " <p> He blinked as she crossed the room and began picking up her clothing . " Man , " she said , " I must have been , like , totally shitfaced , you know ? " She glanced at him and grinned . " Because , like , I do n't remember anything . " <p> She bent , stepped into the powder-blue panties , and hiked them up over her hips . Her movements were entirely unself-conscious ; she might have been tying a shoe or brushing her hair . <p> " I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added quickly . " I 'm sure you 're a cool dude and we had a good time and all . " She grinned again , and this time she did look a little embarrassed . " It sure feels like we had an awesome time , know what I 'm saying ? But it 's just , like , totally gone . Those fucking blue kamikazes , I guess . " <p> She hooked the bra over her shoulders and fitted her breasts into the cups . " Do n't be , like , offended or anything , " she said , " but I do n't even remember who you are . " <p> His mouth felt very dry . " For God 's sake , Jennifer- " <p> She giggled . " Jennifer ? Hey , dude , sounds like you got pretty wasted yourself . My name 's not Jennifer , " she said , hooking the bra 's catch . " I 'm Stephanie . Guess you ca n't remember either . " <p> She pulled the skirt on . ' Hey , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything ? " She zipped , buttoned , and made a small tugging adjustment . " That 's right , " she said , " they 're having some kind of , like , Star Trek convention or something , are n't they ? At , like , the hotel ? I think I heard about that . " She shrugged into the top . " Are you , like , into that ? I do n't know anything about it . I just went there for a drink because they 're not too careful about checking ID . " <p> Wonderful , Graham thought . An underage psycho with multiple personalities . If only I can get her out of here before she turns into Greta the Axe Murderer . <p> She bent again and picked up her shoes , looked at them , and made a dismissive face . " Well , " she said to Graham " like I say , it must have been pretty decent . Sorry I ca n't remember . But hey , have a good one , okay ? " <p> Picking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , anyway ? " <p> The door closed behind her . Graham lay back and , after a moment , laughed softly to himself . It was n't a very humorous laugh . <p> That was when the bedside phone rang . He cursed , rolled over , and grabbed up the receiver . " Yes ? " he said . <p> A small timid voice said , " Mr. Graham ? This is the front desk . I 'm afraid there 's been some kind of mistake . " Graham heard apologetic throat-clearing sounds . " Apparently there was a phone call for you last night , but for some reason you were never paged . We 're very sorry- " <p> " Never mind , " Graham said quickly . " Where was the call from ? Is there a message ? " <p> " Yes , in fact , you 're to call St. Andrew 's Hospital at- " <p> " I know where it is , " Graham interrupted . " You 've got the number there , do n't you ? Go ahead and ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was listening to another faceless voice , this one a woman 's , cool and efficient-sounding but softened by an obvious sympathy . " Mr. Graham , " it said , " I 'm afraid Margaret passed away last night , just before midnight . " <p> He bent forward until his face almost touched his knees . His mouth opened without making any sound . For an instant it felt as if all his skin had been stripped away . <p> " For what it may be worth , " the voice added after a moment , " it was very peaceful . It happened in her sleep and she never woke up . The nurses say she actually appeared to be smiling . " <p> Graham sat up as the voice talked on . He hardly heard , let alone paid attention to the words . The telephone receiver hung all but forgotten in his hand as he stared across the room , at the bright-red lipstick message printed on the mirror : <p> SO LONG BIG STOOP DAMN WE WERE GOOD <p> Author Affiliation     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
