Polygamy , she believed was the true Mormon way . So Carmen Thompson married a man who already had five wives . And endured 13 years of agonizing abuse . Then she found her unlikely salvation ... The mainstream Mormon Church , the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , stopped advocating the practice of polygamy in 1890 . Nonetheless , there are an estimated 30,000 polygamists living in the state of Utah , and an equal number- scattered around the rest of the United States . Because plural marriage is against the law , the fundamentalist Mormon sects that still embrace it have for decades kept their practices well hidden . However , in late spring 1998 , John Daniel Kingston , leader of the Kingston group , one of the largest of ( Utah s polygamous families , was arrested for allegedly heating his 16-year-old daughter unconscious because she resisted becoming the fifteenth wife of his 43-year-old brother who was also her uncle . Kingston , arrest and subsequent trial ( scheduled to begin next month ) are forcing polygamy and its abuses out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the spokesperson for Tapestiy of Polygamy , a unique support group for wives and children fleeing polygamous families . For 13 years of my life , starting in 1981 , I was married to a polygamist . Unlike the majority of women who enter into plural marriages , I was n't raised in polygamy . Most polyga Photograph // mous wives have never known anything else . They 're married off as teenagers , usually by the age of 14 , some as young as 9 . They 're taught to be suspicious of outsiders-that is , anyone not in the polyamous community . If they 're allowed to attend public school , they 're usually pulled out after the sixth grade , and if they object to the marriages arranged for them , they 're punished for disobeying God 's wishes . My situation was completely different . I was raised as a mainstream Mormon and chose my marriage of my own free will ; I did n't even meet David* until I was 22 . I was born in Illinois , the youngest of three kids in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my father worked as a food salesman to hotels and restaurants . When I was 12 , our family moved to Salt Lake City because my parents wanted to make sure I would do everything a good Mormon girl was supposed to d ( - marry a returned missionary in the Mormon church . All went as planned until I was about 16 and started questioning church doctrine . When I graduated from high school , I left the church altogether and rebelled against its strict rules . I experimented with drinking ( alcohol is forbidden to Mormons ) , had a love affair , and became pregnant . But after the birth of my son , I began to return to my religious roots . I sought out Mormon fundamentalists , hoping they would have the answers I 'd been looking for . In the course of my search , I met a polygamous woman who really impressed me . She was n't at all what I imagined . She was very opinionated and even joked about polygamy . It was n't long before she became like a big sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including what it was like to share a husband . " You 're a different person than anybody else he 's going to have a relationship with , " she told me . " No one else can have the same relationship with him that vou have . In sharing a hushand , you 're not losing anything . You 're gaining salvation and sister-wives. " looking back , I think part of my attraction to this lifestyle was that I 'd always wanted to he part of a large family . My closest brother is ten years older than I am , so I grew up like an only child . Having sister-wives really intrigued me . To me , romantic love was a fantasy you saw only in the movies . My parents were miserable together . My oldest brother had been divorced several times . So when my friend explained the concept of polygamy , it sounded appealing . The clincher was when she told me to read early Mormon scripture , the part where God came to Joseph Smith ( the founder of the Mormon Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the Celestial Kingdominto heaven-you have to be married plurally . Reading these scriptures convinced me that the true doctrine was polygamy . Around the time I came to this conclusion , my friend introduced me to her brother , David . Less than a week after we met , he said he 'd had a revelation . " God has told me that you 're to be my next wife . " At first I was n't absolutely sure . He was nine years older than I was and already had five wives . But he seemed like a very religious , spiritual man who loved God . So I prayed about it . And I believed that God talked to me and told me that this was what I was supposed to do . David and I were married in a small , private ceremony performed by a patriarch of the polygamist community . I wore casual clothes-no white dressand had no bridesmaids . But we did go to California on a two-week honeymoon . For the first few days I was completely happy . The newest wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attention . Then halfway into our honeymoon , one of my sister-wives-a woman I 'd never met-came to visit us . It seemed she wanted to have another child , and her ideal " breeding time " happened to fall right in the middle of our honeymoon . I was told to take care of her children in the living room of our hotel suite , while she and David spent the night next door in the bedroom . Although I tried not to let it bother me , I felt all kinds of anger and jealousy . But David told me that these feelings were my problem , my sin . So I just prayed to God to somehow give me peace . Following the honeymoon , life settled into a routine . My sister-wives and I lived in several little houses scattered throughout the Salt Lake area . The way we arranged our schedule was fairly simple : David would move from house to house , and everybody had one night a week with him . Mine was Tuesday . When special events came up , we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much nonexistent . But if you had a parent-teacher conference , we 'd try to work it so David could go . We also tried to be very secretive , because polygamy is illegal . The school administrators must have known , because there were all these kids who listed the same father . But the teachers never said anything . Many polygamous groups believe a woman should have a baby every year . The idea is that there are spirits in heaven waiting to get a body to come to earth , and if they 're not born into Mormon families , they 'll be born into " gentile " families-a gentile being anyone who is n't a Mormon . So it 's your job to have as many babies as possible . Naturally , I wanted to fulfill my spiritual duty . So in five years , I popped out four children . Ironically , a polygamous father has few responsibilities toward his kids after they 're born . However , most of them do try to be there for the births . One March , David had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital the same week . The nurses definitely started catching on by the third baby . There are so many things about polygamy that are different from a conventional marriage . For example , there 's no overt affection . And the sexuality behind closed doors is n't intimate either . It 's nearly impossible to give yourself 1() percent to a man when you know that for the next six nights he 's going to be with someone else . At the time though , I chastised myself for being jealous and wanting tenderness . Part of the problem was that I 'd fallen in love with David . But when I expressed feelings of longing-or if , for example , I tried to get him to stay a little later at my house on Wednesday moming-I was told that I was sinning and that I should ask God for forgiveness . After awhile , I did what most polygamous wives do : I began to train myself not to have any emotions at all . David fostered sexual competitiveness among his wives.He would come to me and say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused , he 'd say , " Well , your sister-wife so-and-so does it for me . " I had no idea if she did or not because sisterwives never talk about sex . Besides , doctrine dictates that a woman be totally submissive to her husband . So I felt I had no choice but to do whatever my husband wanted , because I did n't want him to go to one of my sister-wives for it . In most cases , polygamy means poverty , because there are so many children in the family and the husband often does n't hold a job . During the entire 13 years of my marriage , David never worked . He had no reason to . Because he stayed with a different wife each night of the week , he did n't pay rent , utility , or food bills . He lived off of us . And each one of us worked or was on public assistance or both . Photograph // A lot of times our living situations were absolutely awful . During one period , a sister-wife and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her six . We made it work by changing the dining room into a second bedroom . When David came to visit , the wife whose night it was would have the dining room/bedroom . The other wife stayed in the 10 ' by 1() ' bedroom with 11 children . Another time we lived in a house that had no working plumbing and no heat Sometimes we had to live in our cars or camp out . Feeding our 32 collective kids was quite a challenge . Often we managed to put food on the table by searching through Dumpsters for discards . The sister-wives and I would go as teams . We 'd say , " Okay , I 'll drive , if you 'll dive . " One time I was in the Dumpster behind a grocery store , fishing through all the disc ; ards , when all of a sudden the Dumpster started to move . It was being loaded onto a pickup truck to be taken to the dump . As I scrambled out , I thought , It 's bad enough that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to become trash . Some say polygamy is a victimless crime , but that simply is n't so . When you have a grossly unequal distribution of power in the marriage , with religion behind all of it it 's on ! a matter of time before the situation turns abusive . If a man believes he is God in his house , pretty scx ) n he 's treating the wives like children who have to be disciplined . In my case , David became abusive when I started questioning his absolute authority . He began slapping me , punching me , and it gradually escalated . One time I was so scared I tried to get away and call the police . But he caught me , wrapped the phone cord around my neck , and started choking me with it . The only thing that stopped him is the fact that my 5-year-old son came out of the bedroom and saw what was happening . After every violent incident , we would go through the typical abusive cycle . David would be really sorry and tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over to the house in an angry mood , and if I so much as spilled the salt , it would all go wrong again . At first , like most abused wives , I just kept hoping everything would get better . Even if I 'd wanted to leave , I did n't have the money . I had no training for any kind of job ; all I 'd done in my adult life was produce children . So , as the vi ( F lence got worse , I just withdrew further and further into myself . One way of dealing with my growing depression was to eat . Whenever I felt really had , I would just shove something in my face . It was n't long before my weight had ballooned to 35() pounds . Eventually my depression deepened to the point where I was afraid to go out of the house . I had nowhere to turn for help outside my plural family . My mother and I had never been very close , and I hid the fact of my polygamy from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but denied it to herself . My father was aware of what was going on and tried to slip me money whenever he could . With both of them , I tried to put on a cheerful front so they would n't guess how unhappy I was . Then when my father died in 1989 , I lost my only real emotional support . My main source of enjoyment in life was getting together with a bunch of my sister-wives and female family members on Tuesday nights to watch Rl ) sear&gt;ie . We 'd laugh like crazy and be ourselves . Roseanne was my hero ; although she was n't a Mormon , she was raised in Utah and was overweight like me . And she was a strong , talented , and successful woman . Watching her made me believe that maybe I was n't quite so hopeless . Secretly I 'd always felt I was funny myself . Humor had been the way I had coped most of my life . If I could make my parents laugh , they would stop fighting . And I was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my sister-wives who found an article in a Salt Lake paper about a stand-up comedy class . She urged me to try it . I called the man giving the class and told him I was interested in attending but had no money . He was great . " Okay , " he said . " Just come . We 'll work something out . " David did n't really care . He saw me only one night a week , and the class was n't on his night . At the first session I told jokes about being fat and about having five kids as a single mother , which was essentially what my sister-wives and I were . I talked honestly about all aspects of my life-except the fact that I was from a polygamous family . It was n't long before my teacher persuaded me to go to an open-mike night at his comedy club , a concept I found terrifying beyond belief . I remember that first night I was shaking so hard I could n't hold a glass of water without spilling it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lo and behold , the people liked me . I could see that they were laughing , but I was so scared I could n't actually hear the sound of their laughter . Still , I now knew that I had a gift for something . This I can do , I thought , This I 'm good at . Pretty soon I got bumped up to opening act , and then to emcee , which was a paying position . When I had developed a half hour of solid material , I was ready to be a featured act . This meant going on the road and making real money . David actually liked the idea-as long as I sent all my paychecks directly to him . I Ie still felt I was in his total control , and I was . I do n't think it ever dawned on him that comedy might make me strong enough to leave . Photograph Carmen has found happiness and confidence doing stand-ue comedy routines in clubs . // If it had n't been for my sister-wives , I could never have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and now they watched mine . Their whole attitude was " You go , girl ! " It was like I was doing it for all of us . Comedy became my magic wand . While I was onstage , I could say anything I wanted to say , be anyone I wanted to be , and nobody tried to stop me . Performing became my therapy . Every time I came home from the road I felt just a little bit stronger . Before I knew it , I was able to stash a little money on the side . My goal was to have enough to support just my kids and me for 90 days . It took me five years to save that amount . But even then , I was afraid to leave . Part of the problem was my fear of the outside world . The other part was David . One time he said to me , " You know , God gave me a revelation that if any of you women think you can leave and make it in the outside world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't really think David would kill me . But I knew he was capable of inflicting great harm . Finally , something happened that persuaded me I had to get away no matter what : I 'd just returned home from several days on the road . As I drove up to the house , I saw a police car parked in front and my oldest son standing on the sidewalk . When I asked what was going on , the police officer told me that David had chased my son out of the house with an antique sword , threatening to kill him . At first I did n't believe it . Although he 'd been violent with me , David had never hurt the kids . I asked what had happened . David turned to me and said , " I 'm going to kill you , b  --  . " And he said this right in front of the police officer . That was it . David had crossed the line . I knew I could no longer trust that he would n't harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can do anything you want to me , but mess with my kids , and it 's over . As the police took David away , I asked how long he would be locked up . " Well , he 'll probably be arraigned tomorrow afternoon , " they said . I thought to myself Okay . I have hours to take my kids and disappear off the face of this earth . The first two weeks after we ran away we lived in our car because we could n't find anywhere else to stay . Even though I had cash in hand , nobody would rent an apartment to me because I was single with five children . And the homeless shelters would n't accept us unless my 10-year-old son stayed apart from us in a men 's shelter . When I finally did find a place , I was extremely cautious . I never even put my name on my phone . Still I was always on edge . If the kids were ten minutes late getting home from school , I was terrified that David had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted the kids . But he knew that if he had them , I would go back . Finally , I decided I was n't going to let him scare me anymore . Shortly after I came out of hiding , we wound up in a legal battle over the children . I was awarded custody , and David was granted supervised visitations . After three or four visits , though , he stopped seeing them altogether . One day , I happened to read an article in the newspaper about a woman who had also recently left polygamy . I called the editor and said , " Please give this woman my number . " The woman , Vicky Prunty , called me back , and we had a wonderful conversation . Then we lost contact . But a year and a half later , I read that Vicky was organizing a support group for women who were trying to get out of plural marriages . It was called Tapestry of Polygamy . I called her and right away we began brainstorming . That was last May . Since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We get two dozen calls a week from women who tell us the most astounding stories . A woman called the other day and said her husband had beaten her , but that it was " all right " because she " deserved " it . " I stepped out of line , " she said . She told me she was not calling about herself , but because she was worried about her 12-year-old daughter . Her husband was a stepfather to the daughter and was considering taking her as his next wife . The mother was grief-stricken because she knew she would n't be able stop it . With all these cases , we have to be really careful . If someone turns in a man for abusing a girl , the family will move her across a state line , and the authorities are often reluctant to pursue the case . Sometimes a wife will call us , and when we try to contact her , she 's disappeared . We do n't know if she 's hiding or if she 's dead . When I first began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going to give this a year . My real work is in comedy . " But in the last few months , I 've come to the conclusion that my life 's work is with Tapestry . There 's only a handful of us who are willing to be in the forefront of the movement Most of the women who leave polygamy are afraid to go public . They 're afraid of retribution . We 've received our fair share of threats as well . We 've been told to stop our work or it will " be stopped . " Sometimes it gets spooky . When we attend meetings or speaking engagements , we always go in pairs . In November , I spoke at a university in Provo , UT , and the school 's officials agreed to arrange for security . There 's a long history of violence with many of these polygamous sects . Almost all polygamous groups are armed and fairly paranoid about the outside world . My life is very happy now . In May 1997 , I married Michael , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given me new faith in men . He 's a trucker , so he 's on the road a lot When he 's home , he comes into the Tapestry office and rolls up his sleeves and helps us . I 'll never forget the first time I was interviewed on TV ; he called me afterward at the office and said , " I just want you to know , I am so proud of you . " When I got off the phone , I began to cry . I never had a man say anything like that to me in my entire adult life . My kids have had a rough time adjusting , but they 're doing okay now too . My oldest , Tony , is married and going to college here in Salt Lake . My youngest , Sarah , is 10 , and it makes me feel great to see how strong and self-assured she is . I never want her to go through what I 've been through . I 'm raising my kids to ask questions , and not to stop until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bachelor 's degree in communications at the University of Utah . And in the last year and a half , I 've lost 147 pounds . People who meet me now ca n't believe how heavy I was . I 'm still recovering though . I 'll think I 'm doing just fine , then a woman will call and tell me her story , and it all comes back . The best thing about Tapestry is that we 're our own support group . And whenever we have bad days , the work itself keeps us going . We get encouragement from the most unexpected places , a lot of it from the mainstream Mormon community . Sometimes we even get calls from men who want out of polygamy . Yesterday , someone came up behind me at Starbucks and said , " I recognize you from the news . And I just wanted to tell you , I think you 're incredibly brave . " I do n't feel brave . Often in my first marriage I 'd ask God why I had to endure all this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be able to reach out to all the women out there just like me .
