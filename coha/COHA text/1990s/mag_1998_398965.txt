DID YOU SUFFER A BRAIN LAPSE AND FORGET TO TRAIN FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS ? NO WORRIES . FOLLOW OUR PROGRAM AND YOU 'LL HAVE YOUR BAD SELF BACK IN SHAPE IN 30 DAYS . WE PROMISE . AIright , you blew it . You were in great shape at the end of last summer . Maybe you did a couple of epic off-road rides , a century , some club hammerfests , a cross-state tourperhaps even a race or two . But then the weather fell under the evil influence of El Nino and your boss chained you to a cubicle straight out of Dilbert . Oh , yeah , and those holiday parties . " Honey , these are n't my cycling shorts ! " Oh yes , they are . How are you ever going to get back in shape ? Do n't worry . We 've enlisted two training experts to show you the way : Chris Carmichael , the U.S. cycling coach for the ' 92 and ' 96 Olympics who guides Lance Armstrong 's training ( see page 52 ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible and famed Colorado cycling coach . Their advice works equally well whether you are a roadie or mountain biker-or both . If you have even minimal fitness ( you 've at least done something , right ? ) , you can follow this program . And you should . As a bonus , we include a preview of some ' 98 products that will help you reach peak fitness . Go ahead-get off the couch and into your shorts . It 's time to get back in shape . Here 's how . Snooze and lose What happens when you stop exercising ? It 's called " detraining " and studies on the topic are few and far between , mainly because it 's hard to get subjects . Once an exercise habit gets started , no one wants to stop , even in the interest of science . But we do know some basic facts . Well-trained endurance athletes ' V02 max ( a measure of how much oxygen is supplied to the working muscles ) drops rapidly during the initial three weeks of inactivity , but then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay fitter than untrained people for as long as three months . Surprisingly , max heart rate often rises with inactivity . You wo n't go faster , though-fit cyclists ' hearts pump slower but with a greater " stroke volume , " sending more blood to the muscles with each beat . All the cardiovascular news is n't bad , however . In previously well-trained individuals , the number of blood-carrying capillaries show little change even after several months of inactivity . ( Such capillaries surround individual muscle fibers , transporting nutrients and oxygen to the muscles and clearing away metabolic waste products . ) The bad news is that performance shows the most striking decline . In many sports-including cycling-there is a 10-25% decrease in time-toexhaustion after two to four weeks of inactivity . The bottom line According to BICYCLING Fitness Advisory Board member Ed Burke , Ph.D. , the more fitness you had when the layoff began , the less you 'll lose . " The variable is whether you were a highly trained individual . If you have year-in , year-out fitness you 'll come back faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts-if only twice a week-can help you retain most of your fitness during long periods of reduced training . For instance , sweating through two , 45-minute weekly sessions on the indoor trainer ( e.g. , three to six intervals at 90% of max heart rate ) will forestall most of your fitness deterioration . Quick , ugly and painful-but effective . GYM BUILD POWER AND It all starts in the weight room . A dose of iron improves your strength , resistance to injury and ultimately , your cycling performance . But while most cyclists ( and coaches ) have gotten this message , two myths about resistance training remain : Myth : Weight training adds bulk . Fact : Unless you 're genetically predisposed to muscle gain , moderate resistance training wo n't make you look like a defensive lineman , especially if you continue endurance training . In a University of Illinois at Chicago study , eight subjects performed 10 weeks of low-rep , high-resistance training and subjects increased strength about 30% with no gain in bulk . Better yet , time-to-exhaustion in a strenuous ergometer test improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fact : Increasingly , even the European pros who have been most resistant to weight training pump iron . In fact , Massimo Testa , M.D. , physician for the now-disbanded Motorola team , had his riders doing hard training in the weight room with up to 75 repetitions in some exercises . Eddy Merckx , probably the greatest cyclist ever , says " Cycling has changed . Races are much faster and everyone uses big gears , requiring a lot of power training with leg presses and big gears on hills . " And America 's Lance Armstrong is lifting extensively as he prepares for his comeback from testicular cancer . // HEART RATE MONITORS <p>
