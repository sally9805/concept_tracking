Constance did n't know why she was watching Ray . He came home right after work ; he ate with good appetite . He set out a garden as a thank-you gift to her for staying through the first angry months he was on the wagon . Weekends he helped her dig . <p> The garden was the first she 'd had since she 'd run off to marry him , and even in their strangled backyard soil , packed too hard and seamed with pebbles and old mortar , she was able to grow plants she 'd never before had any success with . Pea plants launched themselves against the back fence , and the strawberry runners formed a solid carpet over the ground , dense as matting . Now she had ambitions for corn , too , if she could get Ray to till the space on the west side of the house . <p> After dinner , when she watered , Ray leaned on a hoe and talked to her . These days he loved to talk . He told her about work , hauling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipments ; jokes he 'd heard on his CB . He met her eye and sang her the corny country songs he listened to all day . " Send me the pillow that you dream on , so darlin ' , I can dream on it too , " he yodeled while she tugged at a broadleaf root as thick as his finger . <p> Still , she could n't help herself . She watched him while he dressed in the mornings , the way he tiptoed to keep from waking her . She watched him nap on Sunday afternoons and stooped to inhale his breath , sour from 7UP and coffee . She began to prowl through the house , checking behind the towels and in the garage . Three years before , when he 'd been arrested for DUI in Nashville , she 'd found bottles stashed in the garment bag with his wedding suit . Now his eyes were clear and she found no bottles at all , but she only looked harder . <p> She was ashamed of what she was doing , and prayed to overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt Ray would be if he knew that only last week she had quietly driven to the truck yard and tailed him all the way home  --  where he drove directly , observing posted speed limits and signaling well in advance of his turns . When Constance pulled into the driveway , he turned , delighted . " Were you right behind me , angel ? I did n't even see you ! " <p> Angel . It was something Ray had picked up from his country songs . She 'd already told him she did n't like it , but in the mornings , before he went to work , he would come up behind her and cradle her shoulders in his ropy arms . " My angel of light . My guardian angel . " <p> " Your angel needs to know what you want for dinner , " she said one morning in June . He 'd been sober almost six months . <p> " Strawberries , " he said , sliding his hands down her sides . " Our harvest . " <p> " You wanted our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream . You expect more than that poor garden can put out . " <p> " If you do n't have expectations , nothing can live up to them , " he said , bending to gnaw at the top of her ear . Constance ducked away and planned a pot roast . She had read somewhere that nutrition was important to sobriety , and ever since she 'd been packing Ray 's lunch with extra sandwiches and bananas . <p> She dawdled , lingering until Ray kissed her good-bye and strode whistling out the door . Then she hurried into the bedroom and stood in front of the closet , pressing her face against every one of his shirts in turn , checking for the stale cigarette smell that would mean he had been to a bar . She did n't stop until she got to his best white shirt , which she knew good and well he had n't worn since their neighbor Judy 's wedding . <p> Leaning into the closet , her face pressed against the stiff cloth , Constance began to cry . She and Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had been grubby and desperate , begging landlords for extensions and facing dinners of macaroni and potatoes . For the six months they had lived in Rushdale , Ray had n't missed a day of work , and Constance felt as if she 'd been slammed onto dry land after a long storm . But she could n't forget the feeling of treacherous swells beneath her feet . <p> At ten that morning , after Constance had washed the breakfast dishes and made up the bed , Ray called . He had never called her from work before , and his voice sounded so hushed and thin that she did n't immediately recognize it . <p> " Hi , angel . You already cleaned those strawberries ? " " What 's wrong ? " " Not a thing in the world . Nothin ' but blue skies . You started dinner already ? " " I have n't even washed my face yet . " " What do you say I take you out tonight ? Wine you and dine you . " <p> " What are you saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and craning over the phone as if she could grab hold of him that way . <p> He giggled . " Just a figure of speech . Come on , girl . Take today off and have a milk bath . We can have a date . Let me take you out to dinner , and this weekend I 'll make a trellis for your peas . They 're a mess . " <p> Constance shook her head . " Would you like me to give you a list of every bill we have n't paid off ? " <p> " The Lord never meant us to use all our money just to pay bills . " <p> " How would you know ? You have n't been in a church in twenty years , " she said . " Heard it on the radio . See you tonight , dollface . " <p> A minute after he hung up , Constance realized that she was panting like a dog ; the old nauseating dread was rolling in her stomach . She slipped on her shoes and gathered the spade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It had been a damp morning , and the sun was late in burning off the fog , so the soil in the bed was still moist and the air smelled sweet . Arrested , she stared at the garden as if she 'd never seen it before  --  the tender nests of lettuce , the sprays of pink and white blossoms on the peas . The air was hot already , stitched with the cries of mockingbirds drawn to the rich , rotted strawberries . She dropped to her knees and brushed her cheek with a hairy zucchini leaf . She ate the leaf right off the vine , snapping its tough stem between her front teeth and chewing , even though the bitter , grassy taste made her eyes water . Her thigh grazed the soft pepper leaves , just unfurling  --  they were Ray 's favorite , and she had already promised to make pepper stew with the first crop . She touched the dark leaf with the tips of her fingers . If he started to drink again , she would plow every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constance to The Door of Italy , a modest restaurant that catered to families , and he waved away the waitress who asked if they would like wine . All around them couples were nodding and murmuring . " Judy says to watch out for whiteflies on the tomatoes . She says whiteflies are the big killer around here , " Constance said , while Ray whistled softly into the menu . " I check the plants , but I do n't know what else to do . " <p> Ray smiled and reached across the table to hold her hand . " You keep a good eye on things . " " I 'm just trying for damage containment . The zucchini vines are already a yard long . " " I like to see you happy , " Ray said . " I 'm a lark , " Constance muttered , watching his thumb scrape over her knuckles . " You deserve it , after all the rough times . " " Where do you suppose that waitress is ? I 'm ready for my salad . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back her hand . " I 'm happy . I sing all day . I just do n't like to push my luck . " <p> " The way I figure , you 're owed plus overtime . " He cleared his throat . " I have some news , " he said . He was watching , waiting for her to smile , but Constance felt dread washing over her . " You 'll never believe who came to see me today : Monty George . " <p> Constance put down her glass . " Christ almighty . " " No , wait , " Ray chuckled . " It was great  --  he snuck into my cab . He was waiting there for me when I signed out of the office . He started laughing so hard when he saw the look on my face he about fell out . " <p> " How did he know where you were ? " Constance asked . " He happened to be in town , and he saw me driving out last week , so he waited until he could catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rushdale ? Just looking for life to happen in Rushdale , California ? " " He 's changed . He 's a distributor for AgPro . He was in town with a new line . " " Monty has become a salesman ? " " I told you , he 's changed . " <p> Constance tried to drink her water , but her throat was hard and tight . Ray had never been able to lie to her , though he 'd tried when he was drinking . She 'd known from the second he phoned that morning . But for all the time spent sniffing Ray 's shirts , she was still caught unawares . She could never have sniffed out Monty . <p> "  --  and damn if he does n't tell me that he 's sober too ! " Ray was saying . " He 's got me beat by thirteen months . The day the cop had to tell him what city he was in , he began to consider adjustments . " Ray whooped and slapped his thigh . " What does he want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you , for one thing . He asked about you right off . " <p> " Do n't tell me that Monty George snuck into your truck because he wanted to know about me . " <p> " You 'll be surprised when you see him . He said he had an idea , but he did n't want to talk about it unless you were there too . He still talks the same way . ' Any partnership , ' he said , ' requires full communication . ' " <p> Constance was rolling shreds of her bread into pellets . " What do you suppose he meant by that ? " <p> " I think he has an idea , angel , " Ray said , bending swiftly to kiss her hand and then gesturing to the waitress . <p> Monty dated back to Cleveland , and the long-distance refrigeration company that had work for Ray one week out of three . Constance and Ray had been married just over a year , long enough for their positions to harden ; their arguing was daily and mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first morning there . Constance was twenty-two , still capable of hope . She let him in . <p> He was a tiny man , half a head shorter than she . By the summer , when she would awaken to find him watching their television , she would come to know his plump shoulders , as undeveloped as a boy 's , and the fragile length of his shin . But on this first , icy day all she noticed was the sheen on his skin , as if it held too much blood . <p> " So you 're the new footsteps , " he said . " You walk a lot  --  did anyone ever tell you that ? " <p> It was a Sunday , and Ray was still in bed , snoring through slack lips . " My husband is in the other room , " she said . " We came yesterday , from Indiana . " <p> Monty pushed past her , glancing into the galley , where she had piled their three boxes of dishes and pots , and pausing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed from the rest of the room . " Are you going to be making breakfast soon ? " he said . " I 'd like to know what your schedule is , as long as I 'm going to be hearing you anyway . Myself , I 'm an early bird . Hate to miss the dawn . " He scooted back to Constance and rested his pudgy hand on her wrist . " You never know when life is going to happen . " <p> Constance heard Ray swing his feet to the floor , as if on cue , and shamble out from behind the sheet , blinking into the light like a bear . " Think you could get it any colder in here , Constance ? " he said . He held the blanket around him for a robe , and she could smell his breath from where she stood . <p> " This is Monty . He lives downstairs . " Ray squinted at him . " You 're the little guy who watched me pull the mattress up the stairs . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best to stay out of the way . Why do n't you come on down to my place ? I 've got something that can warm you up . " He winked . Ray lifted his head then and looked sharply at Monty . " I believe I ' 11 do that , " he said . " Neighborly . " <p> " Neighborly , " Monty repeated , and bowed to him , his arms at his sides and his tight body creasing at the waist . <p> Constance said , " I believe I ' 11 stay . I wo n't be comfortable until things ; are tidy . " But Ray and Monty were bowing toward each other like dolls , grinning and repeating , " I will . I believe I 'll do that , neighbor . " After they went downstairs , she made a point of walking across the apartment as many times as she could , stamping her feet over the place where she thought Monty 's sofa might be . <p> Ray did n't come home until after nine that night . Constance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , hung and folded her clothes . At seven she heated up a pot of soup , and at seven-thirty she dumped the remainder down the drain and scrubbed and put away the pot and her bowl and spoon . When Ray came in , she was reading an article about cupcakes in a year-old Woman 's Day she 'd found in the closet . <p> " Do you know what you sound like from downstairs ? " he asked her from the doorway . <p> " What if you get called to work tomorrow ? " she said . Ray minced across the floor , lifting his knees waist-high on each step and furiously drumming his feet when he reached the middle of the room . " You sound just like that . A hundred-pound mouse . " <p> " The dispatcher could call , you know . They fill most of their replacements on Monday . " " Stop mousing at me , woman , " he said , and giggled . <p> " We 'll go to Cleveland , ' " she mimicked . " Lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a run of bad luck . " <p> " Squeak , squeak , squeak . Sorry , Constance , but I ca n't hear you over all the mice in here . " <p> " It does n't take you long , does it ? " she said . " I have the gift for making friends . " " If you could just hear yourself . " <p> Ray 's expression softened and then collapsed into tragic remorse ; he dropped his hands and sat on the box beside him , which crumpled under his weight . Looking up at her from the floor , he said , " It 's not fair , is it ? You were up here all day by yourself , putting things away . I got to have fun while you were putting things away . " <p> " It 's all right , " Constance said . " I got a lot done . " <p> " No , it 's not all right . You 're my wife . You should n't have to be alone all day . Tomorrow I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ray , for God 's sake . " <p> He stood up and waved his hands ; he would hear no more . " And if we see any mice , " he said before he pulled down the sheet to the alcove , " we 'll shoot them . " <p> Like Ray , Monty was a happy drunk . In the whole year they lived in Cleveland , Constance never saw him fully sober , but the more Monty drank , the more courtly he became , and the more apt to share his delight over a sunrise , new irises in the spring , Constance 's hamburger casserole . When she brought in clean laundry , he buried his face in it and cried , " Just smell ! Clean sheets ! " He 'd pound his tiny fists against the wall . <p> Constance did n't encourage him , but still Monty marveled at every counter she sponged , every potato she baked . Eventually her impatience and embarrassment dropped away , and she found herself pointing out bellying clouds just so she could watch how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared dinner , he hoisted himself onto the narrow counter and narrated her actions . <p> " She 's chopping up the onions now ; her knife 's a blur . She goes so fast she does n't have a chance to cry . Now she 's checking the bowl with the bread dough , seeing how it 's rising . It 's rising like the sun . And now she 's back to the cutting board with more onions . " <p> From the outer room Ray would wander in , rummage in the tiny refrigerator , and pull out two cans . In all the time he spent with them , Monty hardly ever helped himself . Ray would pause until Monty picked up his narration again , and then return to the upholstered chair left by the previous tenant . They would stay up long after Constance went to bed ; she learned to fall asleep through their giggling and proclamations . As often as not , Constance found Ray passed out in his chair in the morning , but Monty was awake and ready for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . <p> She had no idea how he lived . At least Ray drove occasionally , bringing home enough for potatoes and another week 's rent . But she never saw Monty work . Sometimes , when she reminded him that he ate all his meals with them and used their squat shower , he would pull a damp twenty-dollar bill from his shirt pocket . Constance would take it , too embarrassed to ask where the money came from . <p> In October , a week after a quarrel with his supervisor which cut Ray off forever from Cleveland Refrigerated Hauling , Constance snapped awake in the middle of the night . The towel over the window had slipped , and the grayish moonlight was bright enough to read by . As she stood on the bed to rehang the towel , she heard something from the outer room . It was a dim , blurred sound , and she realized now that it had been going on for some time . Constance steadied herself against the window and listened . This was nothing like Ray and Monty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chorus of " Blue Skies . " The sound was murmurous and steady as a pulse . <p> She edged off the bed next to the sheet , pulling it aside just enough to see into the outer room . Ray and Monty were sitting on the floor , their legs crossed . A candle burned between them with thick braids of wax collapsing down its sides . The wick had sunk so that it gave off almost no light , and she could n't see Ray 's expression , but Monty 's , just over the flame , was rapt , his little pie-shaped face wet and shining . " Full moon , " he said . " Full moon . Fill up my pockets . " <p> " Full moon , full moon . Fill up my pockets , " Ray said , joining him . He was swaying slightly . <p> Constance could see that her pots and bowls were on the floor around the two men , even the good cut-glass bowl that she had forbidden Ray ever to touch . " What are you doing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked up . Monty kept chanting , glancing away from the candle only long enough to nod at her . <p> " Hey , Constance . You ought to like this . We are bringing home the bacon , " Ray said , swallowing a belch . <p> " Hush , " Monty said serenely . " We 're almost finished . Full moon , full moon , fill up my pockets . " <p> Constance leaned against the wall and watched while Monty and her husband chanted , surrounded by open bowls . Their voices swelled and subsided like waves . " Ray , for God 's sake , " she said . <p> Monty rose to his feet and raised his palms toward the ceiling . " Full moon ! " he cried . " Full moon ! Fill up my pockets ! Fill ! Fill ! Fill ! " <p> Ray stood too , and gazed at the ceiling as if he expected to see faces there . " Fill ! Fill ! Fill ! " <p> For a moment they held their positions in attentive silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder . " Now we wait , " he said to Ray . <p> " I told you she 'd be like this , " Ray said , motioning with his head to Constance . <p> " Are n't you two a little old for seances ? " she asked . <p> Monty looked modestly at the floor . Ray said , " You do n't even know what you 're seeing . This is power . This is putting ourselves in the center of life 's ongoing process . " <p> " The only thing you 're in the center of is a bottle . Full moon . I came up with better magic in grade school . " <p> " That 's your whole problem , Constance . We 're calling on the power of the whole damn beautiful universe , and you want to sleep through it . " <p> " I must have missed the part with the universe . By the time you woke me up , all that was going on was two drunks howling at the moon . " <p> Monty shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constance glared at him . " This is all you , is n't it ? This was your brilliant idea . " <p> He shrugged again . " I do it every month . Once , I opened a drawer and found a hundred and sixty-four dollars . " <p> " A hundred and sixty-four dollars ! " Ray broke in . " For opening a drawer ! And he never has to put up with snide sons of bitches who think they can tell me how to drive my own route . " <p> " Out , " Constance said to Monty , pointing to the door . <p> " He 's only telling you the truth . If you 'd just open your eyes , you could be happy , " Monty said . <p> She grabbed Monty at the elbow , her fingers sinking into the fleshy joint . " Every time I open my eyes , you 've caused more damage . We came here to start fresh , but you 've made him worse than ever . " <p> " He 's my friend . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray said , but he had slumped into his chair , one foot propped on her soup pot , and his head wobbled and drooped . <p> " You do n't know what you 're doing . I want to help you . I 'm your best friend , " Monty said to Constance , who was marching him to the door . <p> " I 'll know my friends when I meet them , " she said . " You can bet they wo n't be weird little sponging drunks who expect miracles to pay their rent . " She yanked him into the hall , where the light was out again , and shoved him in the direction of the stairs . After she heard the soft thump of his body hitting a wall , she closed the apartment door , blew out the sputtering candle flame , and went back to bed , pulling the blanket over her head to block out Ray 's snoring  --  a sound Monty had once called magnificent . <p> On the way home from The Door of Italy , Constance was quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat to squeeze his hand when he told her how pretty she looked . As soon as he left the house the next morning  --  a long day ahead , a full load from Salinas  --  she headed for the shower . Constance knew she needed to get to Monty first . She could n't wait for Ray to bring him home ; already she could imagine the two of them at the door , giggling and bowing . She had to brace herself against the shower wall at the thought . <p> Later , just as she was leaving , she picked up a sack and hurried out to the garden . She collected five good-sized lettuce heads and a handful of snow peas , glancing at the tomato plants while she picked . If she had to make small talk , she could always ask him about whiteflies . <p> It was a clear day , still cool in the shade . Constance found herself half jogging , sweating , and she jumped when a dog yapped at her . Now that she knew he was here , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and before she was five blocks from home her heart was already thudding . She had to pause in a doorway to smooth her hair and skirt , and even so she was breathless when she walked into the beige waiting room and the receptionist looked up . <p> " Monty George , " Constance said , and a man standing at the filing cabinet turned and grinned . <p> " I knew I knew those footsteps . How are you , Constance ? " <p> " Good Lord , " she said . He had become slim and lithe . She could have passed him on the street without looking twice . His dark slacks hung with a snappy crease , and rich hair waved over his forehead . He reminded Constance of a politician . <p> " You still have a call waiting , Mr. Miller , " the receptionist said , and Constance glanced around . <p> " I 'll call back , " Monty said , crossing the room and touching Constance just above the elbow . <p> " Mr. Miller ? " Constance said <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got sober , I thought I should respect it . " <p> " Ray did n't mention you had a new name . " <p> " I did n't have time to tell him . " He winked up at her . " Things do n't change , do they ? You always did know more about me than Ray . " <p> " I do n't know about that , " Constance murmured . She held out the sack of vegetables . " They 're from our garden . Ray set it out for me . " <p> " He mentioned , " Monty said . " He said that you could make anything grow . " <p> " He exaggerates , " she said . " You know Ray . " <p> " Not anymore . He looks great , Constance . You 've been good for him . " She shrugged , but Monty pressed his hand back on her elbow and kept talking . " I love how life brings the loose ends back together . After all those years ago in that dump in Cleveland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journey . So , are you going to join us for lunch ? " <p> Constance had been distracted by the weight of his hand on her arm ; the question caught her off balance . " Lunch ? " " Is n't that why you 're here ? I 'm supposed to meet Ray in ten minutes . " <p> " Ray 's driving to Salinas . He wo n't be back until late . " " His routing got changed this morning . Just a run to the extension office . He probably tried to call you , but you were already out . " Monty smiled , told the receptionist they would be back in two hours , and propelled Constance out the door while she stammered and hesitated . The last twosome on earth she wanted to join was Ray and Monty . <p> The sunlight was sharp , and she squinted at Monty , realizing she 'd never seen him outside before . He walked with an assertive stride ; Constance saw women across the street cut their eyes to him . He was telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurrying her like a terrier . She would n't believe the coincidences in his life since he 'd stopped drinking . He 'd met people he had n't seen since he was a boy . What he 'd finally learned was that paths were set up to cross and cross again . So much needless anxiety . We never really lose anybody . <p> He steered her around the corner and across two streets , calling out to people as they went . He could greet them by name , remember children and pets . " How 'd those onions take to the new manure ? " he yelled . " Ever find Scooter 's doll ? " <p> He chattered and whooped all the way into The Happy Cup , where Ray , waiting with coffee , jumped up as Constance came in . <p> " Look who found me this morning , " Monty said , nudging Constance to sit down and then crowding in next to her . <p> Ray relaxed , smiling at her frown and slinging his arm across the back of the seat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Do you have a self-respecting refrigerator yet ? I remember Constance defrosting the one in Cleveland every other day . " <p> Constance glanced at Monty with surprise . She thought she remembered every inch of that apartment , but she had forgotten the refrigerator . Monty had named it Juneau . <p> " And that Godawful chair , " Ray was saying . " Every time you sat down , your head was level with your knees . " <p> Monty shook his head in delight . " One night after you went to bed , I was wide awake and hungry , so I took a box of macaroni and cheese , ran water into a bowl , and just dumped everything in . I figured the macaroni would soften up eventually , but after ten minutes they were still like little U-joints . I knew Constance would get mad if she found it in the trash . So I took the whole pot up on the roof and spread the stuff around like roofing tar . That orange sauce reflected the moonlight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WE.I wanted to do WELCOME , but I ran out .

" I went up one night to drink and I saw this weird fuzzy patch out by the edge . I was afraid to get near it . It looked radioactive . " <p> " Do you remember anything ? " Monty asked , wheeling to face Constance , who shuddered . <p> " I 'm not like you . I try to forget . " In her dreams , when Ray started drinking again , it was always that apartment she returned to . " I could never get the kitchen clean . " <p> " I remember Monty sitting on the counter and singing ' She 'll Be Comin ' Round the Mountain . ' while you made dinner , " Ray said . " I never heard so many verses . " <p> " I 'm surprised we can remember anything , " Monty yipped . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two men laughed harder , Ray reaching for her hand while Monty snaked his short arm around her shoulders . <p> " Who would have guessed ? " Ray said . " Who would have ever imagined we 'd survive it ? " <p> Constance cleared her throat . " So , Monty . What can you tell me about whiteflies ? " <p> He sat up again , affectionately squeezing her shoulder before he let his arm slip . " We have some products I can sample for you , but "  --  he glanced around and lowered his voice  --  " I 'll tell you the best thing . Garlic spray , a little patience . And grow marigolds . They repel bugs and look cheerful in the garden . " <p> Constance frowned . " I want to have tomatoes this year . " <p> " You should see her in that garden , " Ray said . " If a plant does n't come up , it 's got Constance to answer to . " <p> " I 'd come up , " Monty said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broccoli 's more obedient than you two ever were , " Constance said . <p> Ray leaned toward Monty .

She felt as though she were in a room with no air . <p> " Sorry , " she said , trying to sound light . " All I asked about was whiteflies . " <p> The three of them stopped talking , and in the pause Constance saw Ray 's crestfallen look and a spot that had somehow gotten on his shirt since the morning . She dropped her eyes . She had n't meant to sound so hard . They pushed her ; they always had . " Maybe you do n't need marigolds , " Monty was saying . " Those snow peas you brought me look fine . And of course there are several products . " <p> " No , you 're right , " she said , cutting Monty off . " I 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Could n't hurt , " Ray said , brightening . <p> " Who knows ? " Monty said . <p> Constance left Ray and Monty at the cafe . They wheedled and protested when she got up , but by the time she made it to the door they had their elbows on the table and were snorting like a couple of teenagers . Ray came home that night with marigold flats balanced on each arm . <p> " Monty really knows about this , " he said over dinner . " He 's been reading up , talking to people , visiting organic farms . You should hear it . Interplanting , pheromones . " <p> " I 'll bet he plants at high tide , too . " Constance speared a piece of pot roast for Ray 's plate . <p> " Monty never met an idea he could n't improve on . The man 's got vision . Does n't he look great ? " <p> Constance sighed . " No .

" So , did you stay in The Happy Cup all afternoon ? " <p> " We went for a drive  --  he wanted to show me the acreage he 's leased east of town . People waved when we passed . I felt like I was with a movie star . " <p> " He may have missed his calling . How was the land ? " " What do I know ? He 's got forty acres . He wanted to know if a truck could get through for produce . " <p> " Forty acres ? " Constance said . " How does he think he 's going to live ? You ca n't even get grocery money off forty acres .

Cultivating that kind of land and holding down a job ought to wear out even Monty George . " <p> " It 's leveled , already prepared , " Ray said . " He wants to raise different crops , some things that are new around here . Work by hand . Get someone he trusts to work with him . " Ray stopped and looked at Constance , who choked . <p> " Oh , no , " she said . " Sorry , boys . I 'll wait for the moon to fill up my pockets before I tenant for Monty George . " <p> " Stop for a minute and listen . You 'd finally have enough room to grow corn . And Monty 's got strategies for the tipburn you were getting on that lettuce . " <p> " So you two just sat there all afternoon and planned my future . " <p> " He 's got you in mind . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " What , somebody sober ? " Constance cried , and Ray set his mouth . " Or somebody who knows how to work ? You think everything has changed . Well , nothing 's changed . You and Monty George talk , and I 'm the one who does the hoeing . " <p> " You know , " Ray said , his voice so high and tight it seemed to curl at the edges , " that 's exactly what Monty said . ' Somebody has to be sober here . ' His words exactly . " <p> " How reassuring , to hear Monty 's assessment of the situation . " <p> " You 'd be in real danger of learning something if you stopped your precious work long enough to listen . " <p> " You 'd be in danger of making something of yourself if you quit listening to Monty . Or maybe you 'd rather be up on the roof with macaroni and cheese . " <p> " People do change , Constance . But you sit there and count up every mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years a mistake ? " Looking at Ray 's bland , satisfied face , she had to clutch the edge of the table . " We did n't have heat , damn it . I slept next to you after I cleaned up your vomit . Am I supposed to believe you 've changed just like that ? " <p> Ray shook his head , his lips thin and trembling . " That 's right . You pinned it . You 're supposed to believe I 've changed just like that . " He pushed his chair back from the table . <p> " Where are you going ? " she said , watching him move toward the door and pick up his jacket . " Guess . " <p> He let the screen door bang behind him , and Constance watched from the kitchen table as he skirted the garden and jumped lightly over the fence . She was shaking and could n't catch her breath . She had n't heard that spiny threat in Ray 's voice in six months ; it was almost thrilling . <p> After five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms still trembling . She wished he 'd eaten more dinner . She wished he 'd stayed long enough to let her tell him he was a saint . Anyone could see it . But she was a saint too , and she was ready to hear somebody say so . <p> At ten o'clock , when Ray was n't back , Constance could n't stand waiting anymore and went out walking . She knew where to go . During their first week in town she had made note of the bars , judging the ones most likely to have a country-western jukebox and a sing-along clientele . She tried First Call , on Fourth Street , and Arlene 's , on Dixon . No Ray , no Monty . She walked twice past The Long Stop , down from Arlene 's , but a brassy din boomed out he door , and she could n't force herself into it . <p> Instead she wandered back home , where she knew Ray would n't be waiting for her . The thought was comforting , and Constance relaxed as the sweet night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's gardens by the occasional porch light  --  shapes of trees and hedges , white roses like candles in the dark . Passing a low fence draped with honeysuckle , Constance picked off a strand to smell as she walked . <p> By the time she turned onto her block , she felt buoyant , ready for a drive . She wanted to find not Ray but the land itself . The creamy moon was finally rising , giving Constance enough light , once she was out of town , to see where to turn off the state road and then off the gravel access spur , and then to make out the two figures alone in the field , standing and waving her in . <p> " Took you long enough , " Ray said when she closed the car door behind her . " I did n't think you were coming , but Monty kept saying we had to wait for you . " <p> " What are you waiting for ? " Constance said , teetering and sliding down the low incline toward them . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaf . " " Do n't tell me , " Constance said . " I get to be the root . " " You hold things in place , angel , " Ray said . " All our searching brought us here , " Monty said , and she turned to him . <p> " You did n't have to search us out , " she said . " We were doing fine . " <p> " Life puts us in each other 's way , " he murmured . " I 'm ready to be in someone else 's way , " she said . " Then why did you come here tonight ? " Ray asked . " To serve notice , " she said . <p> During the long pause that followed she listened to the night insects and felt pleasantly airborne . " Constance ? " Ray finally said , his voice jagged . " Are you going to leave now ? After everything ? " <p> " I could use a break , " she said after a while . <p> A week later she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They rode in Ray 's cab , Constance sitting up high between the two men , who kept laughing and elbowing across her to switch the radio station . <p> In the daylight she could see that the plot was hedged on two sides by walnut groves . Constance wondered about late-afternoon shadows , but she kept her concern to herself . Beside her , Monty was craning to see over the dashboard . He pointed out the places he had retilled , where the soil lay like cake in dark and moist ridges . <p> The men got out of the truck and Monty began to pace out rows , marking them with twine . He had brought compost and seed in bulk from the co-op . Constance poured herself a cup of coffee from Ray 's thermos , sat on the cab 's step , and watched them . She smiled , waved , and stayed put whenever they called to her . <p> They clowned , hurdling the furrows and pitching themselves face-down at the end of every row . Sometimes they came back to the truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched , trying to envision Monty 's curving rows of chard , his rye and squash side by side . She should have known Monty 's garden would be like no one else 's . Even when she could see they were getting it wrong  --  the rows too close , seeds too shallow  --  she smiled and waved to them , and did n't say a word . <p>
