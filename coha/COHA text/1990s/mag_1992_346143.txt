IS THE NEW SCHEME AT &T; ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK A blessing or a blight ? Those who ca n't bear to be out of touch will love the company 's new EasyReach 700 service , which gives subscribers a lifelong telephone number that is assigned to the person , not to a particular phone line . Those who think the telephone is already too intrusive will probably want to reach out and touch someone with a baseball bat . <P> The new service , which AT &T; considers a forerunner of future phoning patterns , is simple . Anyone who signs up  --  there are about 6 million subscriptions to go around  --  gets a new number with a 700 area code . Subscribers pay $25 up front and $7 a month after that . Then the number travels with you forever . Visit Aunt Martha and your calls will follow you into her parlor . Move to a new neighborhood or a new state  --  keep the same number . All it takes is 27 digits punched into the nearest phone , and calls made to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( that may seem excessive , but some people now have to enter 28 numbers to make a long- distance credit-card call ) . The caller pays 25 cents a minute for long- distance during peak hours and 15 cents off peak , comparable to most current rates . <P> If it sounds like the existing service known as call forwarding , it is , but with some important differences . With call forwarding , it 's the home phone that has to be programmed to send calls on  --  a lot less convenient for travelers . And it forwards all calls , while the new service forwards only those calls made to the 700 number . Better still , it 's possible to limit 700 calls to those who get a secret password from the subscriber ( in this case , it 's the recipient who gets billed , not the caller ) . Unfortunately , the new service retains one drawback of call forwarding : if the user forgets to cancel a phone 's programming , the 700 calls will keep ringing long after he or she has moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
