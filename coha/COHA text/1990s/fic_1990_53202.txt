ContentsCALL TODAY ! MARRY TODAY ! YOUR WEDDING ! YOUR WAY ! EIGHTEEN OR OVER ? WE WO N'T SAY NAY ! ( MAY BORROW VEIL AND BOUQUET ) # When Gracie Kang 's elder twin sisters reached the age of eighteen , they went down to the Alameda County Shipyards and got jobs piecing battleships together for the U.S. Navy . This was the place to find a husband in 1945 , if a girl was doing her own looking . They were Americans , after all , and they were of age . Her sisters caught the bus down to the waterfront every day and brought home their paychecks every two weeks . At night , they went out with their girlfriends , meeting boys at the cinema or the drugstore , as long as it was outside of Chinatown . <p> Gracie 's parents would never have thought it was husbands they were after . Girls did n't choose what they were given . But the end of the war distracted everybody . While Mr. Kang tried to keep up with the papers and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped away one day with a black welder enrolled in the police academy and Sung-Ohk took off with a Chinatown nightclub singer from L.A. with a sister in the movies . <p> Escaped . Gracie had watched from the doorway that morning as Sung-Sook pulled on her good slip in front of the vanity , lifted her hair , breathed in long and slow . Her eyes came open , she saw Gracie 's reflection . " Comeer , " she said . " You never say goodbye . " She kissed Gracie between the eyes . Gracie had only shrugged : " See you . " Then Sung-Ohk from the bathroom : " This family runs a laundry , so where 's all the goddamn towels ? " <p> When the girls did n't come home , the lipstick and rouge wiped off their faces , to fold the four o'clock sheets , she understood what was what . On the vanity in the girls ' room she found a white paper bell with sugar sprinkles . In silver letters , it read : <p> CALL TODAY ! MARRY TODAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? WE WO N'T SAY NAY ! ( MAY BORROW VEIL AND BOUQUET ) As simple as having your hair done . Gracie sat at the vanity , thinking of the thousand spirits of the household her mother was always ticking off like a grocery list  --  spirit of the lamp , the clock , the ashtray . Spirit in the seat of your chair . Spirit of the stove , the closet , the broom , the shoes . Spirit of the breeze in the room , the Frigidaire . Gracie had always been willing to believe in them ; she only needed something substantial to go on . Now , in her sisters ' room , she felt that the spirits had been there , had moved on , to other inhabited rooms . <p> Those girls had escaped Thursday evenings with the old chong-gaks , who waited effortlessly for her father to give the girls away . No more sitting , knees together , in white blouses and circle skirts , with gritted smiles . Now Gracie would sit , the only girl , while her father made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , much younger , the dutiful one , would n't run away . If her mother had had the say , the girls would have given their parents grandchildren by now . But she did n't have the say , and her father smiled his pleasant , slightly anxious smile at the chong-gaks and never ever brought up payment . <p> He was the one paying now . No one got dinner that night . Pots flew , plates rattled in the cabinets , the stove rumbled in the corner , pictures slid , clanked , tinkled . " Now we 'll have a nigger for a grandson and a chink for a son-in-law , Mr. Kang ! " her mother shouted . She cursed Korean , but had a gift for American slurs , translating the letter found taped to the laundry boiler into the horrors of marrying for love . <p> Gracie and Little Gene pressed themselves against the wall , squeezed around the Frigidaire , sidled to the staircase . They sat and backed up one step at a time , away from the stabs and swishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean grandchildren , Mr. Kang ? You 're the one who let them fall into American love . Could I help it there are n't any good chong-gaks around ? Thought we 'd pack the girls off to Hawaii where the young ones are ? Ha . I 'd like to see the missionaries pay for that ! " <p> Their father came into view below . Hurried , but with his usual dignity , he ducked and swerved as necessary . Silently , solemnly , he made for the closet , opened the door , and stepped in among the coats . The blows from first the bristled then the butted end of the broom came down upon the door . <p> Little Gene whispered , " I 'm going outside . " <p> " Fine , " Gracie told him . " If you can make it to the door . " <p> " Think I ca n't manage the window ? I land in the trash bin , pretty soft ! " <p> Gracie told him , " Bring me back a cigarette , then , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not very big for thirteen , he was still number one son . Gracie stuck her fingers in her mouth all the way to the knuckle , clamped down hard . <p> She chopped cabbage , scrubbed the bathhouses , washed and pressed and folded linen and laundry , dreaming up lives for her sisters . From their talk and their magazines , she knew how it should go . Sung-Sook stretched out by the pool in a leopard-print bathing suit with pointy bra cups and sipped colored drinks from thin glasses , leaving a pink surprise of lips at the rim . Somebody else served them , fetched them , cleaned them . Her husband shot cardboard men through the heart and came home to barbecue T-bones . Every night they held hands at the double feature . Sung-Ohk slipped into a tight Chinese-doll dress and jeweled cat-eyes , sang to smoky crowds of white people from out of town . Her lips grazed the mike as she whispered , " Thank you , kind people , thank you . " In the second act , her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with **27;27;TOOLONG flair . All the white people craned their necks and saw that Oriental women could have good legs . <p> They left Gracie and her mother with all the work . At first , her father tried to help out . He locked up the barbershop at lunch , crossed the street , passed through the kitchen , and stepped into Hell , as they called it . But her mother snapped down the pants press when she saw him and from a blur of steam shouted , " Fool for love ! I 'm warning you to get out of here , Mr. Kang ! " <p> She bowed her head at the market now . She had stopped going to church . Lost face , it was called . And there was the worry of it . No one knew these men who took the girls away . Maybe one was an opium dealer and the other was a pimp . Maybe those girls were in for big disappointment , even danger . Her father twisted his hands , helpless and silent in the evenings . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washers shut , punched the buttons with her fists , helpless , too . <p> It was true he was a fool for love , as far as Gracie could tell . Her mother slapped at his hands when he came up behind her at the chopping board to kiss her hair  --  pretty brave , considering that knife . When her mother tried to walk behind him in the street , he stopped and tried to take her hand . Gracie and her mother were always nearly missing buses because she 'd say , " Go on , Mr. Kang . We 're coming , " and they 'd stay behind as she cleaned out her purse or took forever with her coat , just to have it the way she had learned it , her husband a few paces ahead , women behind . Maybe the girls would never have gotten away if he 'd been firm about marriage , strict about love . <p> Where her parents were from , shamans could chase out the demon spirits from dogs , cows , rooms , people . Maybe her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because when Thursday came around , he sat in the good chair with the Bible open on his knees , and Gracie sat beside him , waiting . Life was going to go on without her sisters . Her life . Gracie watched her father for lingering signs of foolishness . Above the donated piano , the cuckoo in the clock popped out seven times . As always , her father looked up with a satisfied air . He loved that bird . Her mother believed there was a spirit in the wooden box . The spirit was saying it was time . <p> Little Gene was free in the streets with that gang of Chinese boys . She waited for her cigarette and his stories  --  right now , he might be breaking into the high school , popping open the Coca-Cola machine , busting up some lockers . There were n't any Jap boys left to beat up on , and they stayed away from the mostly black neighborhoods or they 'd get beat up themselves . Gracie sat with her hands clasped at her knees , worrying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tap-tap of the missionary ladies from the United Methodist Church . Their hats looked like squat birds ' nests through the crushed ice window . Every Thursday , they seemed to have taken such pains with their dresses and hats and shoes , Gracie could n't think how they had lasted in the mountain villages of Pyongyang province . She had never been there herself , or been to mountains at all , but she knew there were tigers in Pyongyang . <p> Her father rose and assumed his visitors smile . " Everyone will be too polite to mention the girls , Gracie , " he told her . That was the only thing at all he said about them to her . <p> The ladies stepped in , chins pecking . One bore a frosted cake , the other thrust forward a box of canned goods . American apologies . As though the girls had died , Gracie thought . Her father stiffened , but kept his smile . <p> " We think it 's wonderful about the war , " the cake lady began . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Spam lady went on . They looked at one another . <p> " The Japanese Japanese , " said the second . She paused . " And we are so sorry about your country , Mr. Kang . " <p> " But this is your country now , " said the first . <p> Her father eased them onto more conversational subjects . They smiled , heads tilted , as Gracie pressed out " Greensleeves , " " Colonial Days , " " Jesus , We Greet Thee , " on the piano . And at half past the hour , they were up and on their way out , accepting jars of kimch'i from her mother with wrinkle-nosed smiles . <p> The barbershop customers did not come by . Mr. Woo from the bakery and Mr. and Mrs. Lim from the Hunan restaurant stayed away . All the Chinese and Koreans knew about saving face . Except the chong-gaks , who knew better , surely , but arrived like clockwork anyway , a black blur and a white blur at the window . They always shuffled their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father used to say , " That 's very Korean , " to Sung-Sook and Sung-Ohk , who did n't bother to fluff their hair or straighten their blouses for the visitors . They used to moan , " Here come the old goats . Failure One and Failure Two . " Her father only shushed them , saying , " Respect , daughters , respect . " Gracie saw that he could have done better than that if he really expected the girls to marry these men , but after all , the girls were right . Probably her father could see that . They were failures . No families , even at their age . Little money , odd jobs , wasted lives . A week before , they had been only a couple of nuisances who brought her sticks of Beechnut gum and seemed never to fathom her sisters ' hostility . They were that stupid , and now they were back . One Korean girl was as good as any other . <p> Gracie could actually tolerate Mr. Han . He had been clean and trim in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Thursday evening since her sisters had turned sixteen . He was a tall , hesitant man with most of his hair , surprisingly good teeth , and little wire glasses so tight over his nose that the lenses steamed up when he was nervous . Everyone knew he had preferred Sung-Ohk , whose kindest remark to him ever was that he looked exactly like the Chinese servant in a Hollywood movie . He always perched on the piano bench as though he did n't mean to stay long , and he mopped his brow when Sung-Ohk glared at him . But he never pulled Gracie onto his lap to kiss her and pat her , and he never , as the girls called it , licked with his eyes . <p> He left that to Mr. Kim . Mr. Kim in the same white suit , white shirt , white tie , and white shoes which had never really been white , but always the color of pale urine . His teeth were brown from too much tea and sugar and opium . This was n't her hateful imagination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working . She knew the armpit stains that spread like an infection when she tried to soak them . The hairs and smudges of ash and something like pus in his sheets . She could smell his laundry even before she saw the ticket . His breath stank , too , like herring . <p> Mr. Kim found everything amusing . " It 's been too warm , has n't it , Mr. Kang ? " he said by way of greeting . Then he chuckled , " I 'm afraid our friend Mr. Han is almost done in by it . " <p> " Yes , let me get you some iced tea , " her father announced . " Mrs. Kang ! " <p> Mr. Kim chuckled again at his companion . " Maybe his heart is suffering . Nearly sixty , you know . Poor soul . He 's got a few years on me , anyway , have n't you , old man ? " <p> Mr. Han lowered himself on the piano bench . " Yes , it 's been too warm , too much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of weakness . Then he said , " And how is Miss Kang ? She 's looking very well . She seems to be growing . " <p> Gracie hunched her shoulders , looked anywhere but at him . <p> " Yes , she 's growing , " her father answered carefully . " She 's still a child . " The men smiled at each other with a lot of teeth showing , but their eyes were watchful . " Of course , she 's a little lonesome nowadays , " her father continued . Mr. Kim eyed him , then he seemed to catch on and slapped his knee  --  gold joke . Mr. Han squinted in some sort of pain . <p> If Mr. Kim had n't been in America even longer than her father had , with nothing to show for it but a rented room above the barbershop , then he might have been able to say , " What about this one , Mr. Kang ? Are you planning to let her get away , too ? " But if he 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , he would n't be sitting in her father 's house and she would n't be waiting to be his bride . <p> Then from the piano bench : " Lonesome , Miss Kang ? " Everybody looked . Mr. Han blinked , startled at the attention . He quietly repeated , " Have you , too , been lonesome ? " Gracie looked down at her hands . Her father was supposed to answer , let him answer . At that moment , her mother entered , head bowed over the tea tray . Gracie could hear the spirit working in the cuckoo clock . <p> Her father had told her once that he 'd picked cotton and grapes with the Mexicans in the Salinas Valley , and it got so hot you could fry meat on the railroad ties . But that was nothing compared to the sticky summers in Pyongyang , where the stench of human manure brought the bile to your throat . That was why he loved Oakland , he said , where the ocean breeze cleaned you out . It reminded him of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit his father who had been forced into the service of the Japanese . And it reminded him of the day he sailed back from America for his bride . <p> Bright days , fresh wind . Gracie imagined the women who had waited for the husbands who had never returned . Those women lived in fear , her mother had said . They were no good to marry if the men did n't come back , or if they did return but had no property , they had no legal status in America and no prospects in Korea . Plenty of the women did away with themselves , or their families sold them as concubines . " You think I 'm lying ? " she told Gracie . " I waited ten years for him . People did n't believe the letters he sent after a while . My family started talking about what to do with me , because I had other sisters waiting to marry , only I was the oldest and they had to get rid of me first ! " <p> Gracie imagined those women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their smooth hair and ancient faces looking out over the water from high rooms . And she thought of Mr. Han gazing from his window out over the alley and between skyscrapers and telephone poles to his glimpse of the San Francisco Bay . Where he was , the sky was black , starless in the city . Where she was , the sun rose , a brisk , hopeful morning . <p> On a morning like that , Gracie took the sheets and laundry across the street and up to the rented rooms . Usually the chong-gaks had coffee and a bun at the bakery and then strolled around the lake , but Gracie always knocked and set the boxes down . <p> Mr. Han 's door inched open under her knuckles . The breeze in the bright room , the sterile light of morning in there , the cord rattling at the blinds . Something invisible crept out from the slit in the door and was with her in the hall . <p> " Mr. Han ? Just your laundry , Mr. Han . " Spirits of memory  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his pockets for malted milk balls or sticks of gum . " Where are your children ? " they 'd asked . " Where is your stove ? Where is your sink ? Where is your mirror ? " Mr. Han had always smiled , as though he were only hiding the things they named , could make them appear whenever he wanted . <p> She pushed the door open , and the spirits of memory mingled with the spirits of longing and desire . The bulb of the bare night light buzzed , like a recollection in a head full of ideas . Mr. Han lay half-on , half-off the bed . One shoe pressed firmly on the floor , as though half of him had had somewhere to go . The glasses dangled from the metal bed frame . That was where his head was , pressed against the bars . His eyes were rolled back , huge and amazed , toward the window . And at his throat , a stripe of beaded red , the thin lips of flesh puckering slightly , like the edges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirled upwards , twisting in their airy , familiar paths . They pressed against the ceiling . They watched her in the corner . His spirit was near , she felt , in the white field of his pillow . Or in the curtains that puffed and lifted at the sill like a girl 's skirt in the wind . <p> Gracie squatted and peered under the bed . The gleam there was a thing she had known all of her life , a razor from the barbershop . Clean , almost no blood , like his throat . She knew it was loss of air , not loss of blood , that did it . She knew because she 'd heard about it before . Two or three of the neighborhood Japs had done the same , when they found that everything they thought they owned they no longer had a right to . They 'd had three days to sell what they could and go . She did n't know where . She only knew that her father had been able to buy the barbershop and the bathhouse because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the spirits of car horns , telephone wires , shop signs , traffic lights , and a siren , not for him . They were present at the new death  --  curious , laughing , implacable . They sucked the door shut . Gracie started . " Leaving now , " she announced . " Mr. Han , " she whispered to the chong-gak . Then she remembered he 'd become part of something else , something weightless , invisible , near . She said it louder . " Mr. Han . I 'm sorry for you , Mr. Han . " <p> Mr. Kim ate with the Kangs that afternoon , after the ambulances had gone , and again in the evening . His fingers trembled . He lowered his head to the rice , unable to lift it to his mouth , scraping feebly with his chopsticks . Of the death he had one thing to say , which he could n't stop saying : " I walked alone this morning . Why did I decide to walk alone , of all mornings ? " <p> Mrs. Kang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body itself or the police inquiry or who was responsible for his room and his things , but about how best to give peace to the spirit of the chong-gak , who might otherwise torment the rest of their days . He did n't have a family of his own to torment . She 'd prepared a plate of meat and rice and kimch'i , saying , " Where do I put this ? " <p> Little Gene , jealous that Gracie had found the body and he had n't , offered , " How ' bout on the sill ? Then he can float by whenever . Or in his room ? I 'll stay in there all night and watch for him . " Then he patted his stomach . " Or how ' bout right here ? " <p> " Damn , " her mother went on . " I wish now I 'd paid more attention to the shamans . But we stayed away from those women unless we needed them . My family was afraid I 'd get the call because I was sickly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors . But I did n't have it in me . Was it food every day for a month or every month for a year ? What a mystery . Now we 'll have spirits till we all die . " <p> " Girls should n't be shamans , anyway , " Little Gene announced . " Imagine Gracie chasing spirits away . " <p> Asshole , Gracie mouthed . Little Gene flipped her off . None of the adults understood the sign . <p> " You do n't chase them , honey , " Gracie 's mother said to her . " You feed them and pay them and talk to them . " <p> " Tell him , " Gracie answered . " He 's the one who brought it up . " <p> " Feed everyone who 's here first , " Little Gene suggested . Gracie flipped him off in return . <p> " What 's that you 're doing with your fingers , Gracie ? " he shot back . She put her finger to her lips and pointed at her father . His eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lips moving . <p> " Fine , " her mother announced . " Let 's do Christian , Mr. Kang . It 's simpler , as far as I 'm concerned . " <p> Mr. Kim lifted his head from his rice bowl , looking very old . <p> Her mother eyed him sternly . " Cheaper , too . " <p> That night Gracie lay in her bed by the open window . Where was his spirit now ? In heaven , at God 's side ? Or restlessly feeding on bulgogi and turnips in his room ? Or somewhere else entirely , or nowhere at all ? Please God or Thousand Spirits , she prayed . Let me marry for love . Please say I 'm not waiting for Mr. Kim . It 's fine with me if I 'm a chun-yo forever . <p> They held a small service at the Korean United Methodist Church . Her father stood up and said a little about the hard life of a chong-gak in America , the loneliness of these men , the difficulties for Oriental immigrants . Gracie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about heaven . No one even knew for certain if Mr. Han had converted . <p> Mr. Kim sat in white beside Gracie . " Thy kingdom come , " he murmured , " thy will be done . " And he reached out and took her hand , looking straight ahead to her father . His hand was moist . She could smell him . <p> " And forgive us our trespasses , " she prayed . <p> " As we forgive those who trespass against us , " he continued , and he squeezed her hand with the surety of possession , though her fingers slipped in his palm . <p> Gracie never got to the " amen . " Instead , she leaned into his side , tilted her face to his cheek , and brought her lips to his ear . " You dirty old bastard , " she whispered . Then she snatched her hand back and kept her head bowed , trembling . She wished she could pray that he would die , too , if it was the only way . From the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offended hand held open on his knee . Sweat glistened in the creases of his palm . She would never be able to look into his eyes again . For a moment , pity and disgust swept through her . Then , as the congregation stood , she said her own prayer . It went , Please oh please oh please . <p> Little Gene stuck his head in the laundry room . " Hey , you ! Mrs. Kim ! " <p> Gracie flung a folded pillowcase at him . <p> " Whew . Step out of that hellhole for a minute . I 've got something to show you . " <p> He slid a cigarette from behind his ear and they went out the alley-side steps and shared it by the trash bin . " The day they give you away , I 'll have this right under your window , see ? I 'll even stuff it with newspapers so you 'll land easy . " <p> " Nowhere to run , " Gracie told him . It was the name of a movie they 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico someplace ? " <p> Gracie laughed out loud . " You coming ? " <p> " ' Course I am . Mama 's spirit crap is getting on my nerves . " <p> Gracie shrugged . " You 're too little to run away . Why should I need help from someone as little as you ? " <p> Little Gene stood on tiptoe and sneered into her face . " Because I 'm a boy . " Then he grinned and exhaled smoke through his nose and the sides of his mouth . <p> " Dragon-breath , " she called him . <p> " Come on , Mrs. Kim . This way . " They scrambled up the steps , took the staircase to the hall , then stepped through the door that led down again to the ground floor through an unlit passage to the old opium den . It was nothing but a storage room for old washers now , a hot box with a ceiling two stories above them . It baked , winter or summer , because it shared a wall with the boiler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing hide-and-seek or creating stories about the opium dealers and the man who was supposed to have hung himself in there . They could never figure out where he might have hung himself from since the ceiling was so high and the walls so bare . They looked up in awe . Once , Little Gene thought he 'd be clever , and he shut himself in the dryer . Gracie could n't find him for the longest time , but when she came back for a second look , the round window was steamed up and he was n't making any noise . She pulled him out . He was grinning , eyes vacant . " You stupid dumb stupid stupid kid . " <p> Little Gene felt for the bulb on the wall , pulled the chain . Now the old dryer was somehow on its side . There were two busted washers and a cane chair . The air was secret , heavy with dust and heat . Gracie felt along the walls for loose bricks , pulled one out , felt around inside like they used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been hidden and forgotten by the Chinese who had lived there before . <p> Little Gene got on his hands and knees . " Lookit . " He eased out a brick flush with the floor . " Lookit , " he said again . <p> Gracie crouched . He crawled back to make way for her , then pushed her head down . " Down there , in the basement . " <p> She saw dim , natural light , blackened redwood , steam-stained . The bathhouse . " So what ? I clean ' em every day of my life . " <p> " Just wait , " he said . <p> Then the white blade of a man 's back rose into view . Little Gene 's hand was a spider up and down her side . " See him , Mrs. Kim ? Bet you ca n't wait . " <p> The back lowered , rose , lowered again , unevenly , painfully . She saw hair slicked back in seaweed streaks , tea-colored splotches on his back , the skin damp and speckled like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a spider again at her neck . Gracie slapped at him , crouched , looked again . " What the hell 's he doing ? Rocking himself ? " <p> Little Gene only giggled nervously . <p> The eyes of Mr. Kim stared toward the thousand spirits , his mouth hung open . Then those eyes rolled back in his head , pupil-less , white , and still . " God , is he dying ? " Gracie asked . If she moved a muscle , she would burst . " Is he dying ? " she asked again . " Do n't touch me , " she told her brother , who was impatient with spidery hands . <p> Little Gene rolled his eyes . " That 's all we need . He 's not dying , stupid . Unless he dies every day . " Life in a dim bathhouse , Gracie thought . Deaths in bright rooms . <p> A door slammed hard on the other side of the wall . Her mother cursed , called her name . Little Gene giggled and did the stroking motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulled him up with her . He grabbed for the chain on the bulb . Dark . " Do n't scream , " he giggled . <p> " Gracie ! Damn you ! " her mother called . <p> Then his hands flew to her , one at her shoulder , the other , oily and sweet , cupping her open mouth . <p> A letter arrived the next Thursday . Sung-Sook had used her head and addressed it to the barbershop . Her father brought it up to her in the evening . Gracie was at her window , leaning out , watching the sky begin to gather color . " For Miss Gracie Kang , ' " he read . " Care of Mr. Park A. Kang . ' " There was no return address . The paper smelled faintly like roses . <p> With his eyes , her father pleaded for news of them . He said , " You look like you 're waiting for someone . " <p> She shrugged . " It 's Thursday . " She wanted him to leave her alone until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kim . Instead , he came to the window and looked out with her . " Where 's your brother ? " <p> " Wherever he feels like being . " <p> He only smiled . Then he told her , " Mr. Kim has given me money . A lot of money . " <p> She drew herself up . She could n't look at him . " What money ? " <p> " It 's for a ticket , Gracie . He wants me to purchase him a ticket to Pusan and arrange some papers for him . " <p> " Alone ? " she asked . <p> " Alone . " <p> She smiled out at the street , but asked again , " What money ? " <p> Her father answered , " He will be happy to have a chance to tell you goodbye . " And he left her at the window . <p> His money , she knew . Her father 's . She kept still at the window . With her eyes closed , she saw farther than she had ever seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud , in case any spirits , celestial or domestic , were listening . <p> Then she carefully opened her letter . There was a piece of pale , gauzy paper , and a couple of photographs  --  a good thing , since the girls had stolen a bunch of family snapshots when they left . <p> Dear Gracie , <p> I hope they let you see this . You 're going to be an auntie now . Sung-Ohk 's the lucky one , but me and El are really trying . For a baby , you know . That 's El in his rookie uniform and I 'm in my wedding dress . We 're at the Forbidden City , the club in San Francisco . Louie , that 's Sung-Ohk 's husband , got us in free on our wedding night . The other picture is of Louie and Sung-Ohk at Newport Beach . Is n't he handsome ? Like El . We all live near the beach , ten minutes by freeway . <p> You 'd love it here , but I guess you 'd love it anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Maybe they 'll die before Mom and Dad give you away , ha-ha . <p> Be good . Do n't worry . We 're going to figure something out . El says you can stay with us . Sung-Ohk sends her love . I do , too . <p> The letter fluttered in her hand in the window . She pulled open the drawer at her bedside table , folded the paper neatly back in its creases , and set it inside . Then she took out the only thing her sisters had left behind , the sugar-sprinkled , silver-lettered , instant-ceremony marriage advertisement . Gracie breathed in deeply , as her sister had done with the hope of her new life  --  as , perhaps , Mr. Han had done , with the hope of his release . Somewhere near , Little Gene laughed out loud in the street . Her mother banged dinner into the oven . Her father waited below , his Bible open on his knees , to greet the missionary ladies , to say goodbye to Mr. Kim . Below , a white , slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again , she breathed in . And what she took in was her own . Not everything had a name . <p> <p> By Carol Roh-Spaulding <p>
