It sounded jolly . Mother , Betty , and Bob would take the train to the summer cottage on Wednesday . That meant a walk of two miles before they reached the river house , but they could take along sandwiches and have a picnic by the wayside . Father planned to drive up Thanksgiving morning , with dinner in the back seat . Selma promised to remember everything : turkey with chestnut stuffing , cranberries , tomato salad , and pumpkin pie . <p> " The only thing that could keep me back is a blizzard , " said Father , when he left them at the station . " And you can buy plenty of pork and beans at the store . " <p> " Pork and beans on Thanksgiving ! " Bob 's voice showed how the idea horrified him . " Why talk of snow , when there is n't a sign of it ? " called Mother from the car window . <p> The children laughed as they waved good-bye . They thought Father just talked that way to tease them . Hiking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wayside , they discussed their sumptuous dinner . It would taste doubly delicious after three meals of canned food , in a summer cottage , with only a stove to keep them warm . <p> It was too cold to sit down to eat , and the wind , rushing down the right of way , soon found them out . Bob buttoned his red mackinaw tight , and Betty looped her scarf over her mouth and chin . Even Mother bent to escape the blast . " We 'll all have to take care of each other if a blizzard should come . I do n't know this country in winter , " she said . <p> It was a shock to find the store closed . Through the window they could see that the counters were empty , and the shelves bare , save for a stray can or two . <p> Mother sighed . " I 'd feel better with somebody within hailing distance . " <p> " How about my Indian friend ? " asked Betty . " He 's somebody . " <p> " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the ice is n't solid enough to venture on , yet . " The river cottage looked forlorn without its summer canopy of leaves . Bare trunks rose as tall as ship 's mastheads against the sky , and even the sky looked alien and far-away . A frozen bathing suit , swinging grotesquely on the line , made Betty jump . She did n't want to go into that empty house . <p> " Let 's go down to the river , " she begged . " I 'm going to start a fire and warm our beds , " said Mother firmly . <p> She unlocked the door . Bob followed , and Betty , rather than admit her fear , pressed after . They unfastened their knapsacks . <p> " Now suppose you children go down to the shore and bring me a pail of water , " said Mother briskly . <p> The children could n't scamper away fast enough . The house had a deadly chill about it . The shrouded furniture and drawn blinds were ghostly . <p> On the way down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunch that Mother hated to go in as much as we did . " <p> " She 's a sport all right , " Bob said . He was remembering unhappily that he was the man of the party and had n't acted like it . <p> Just then a tapping sound came from over the river . It was the first sound , save their own voices and the wind 's , that they had heard since the train roared away . They scrambled along the banks , listening . A little distance from the opposite shore , a dark figure stood . In one hand he carried a heavy staff . Slowly and cautiously he ventured across the river . Before each step , he came down with his staff , tap-taptap , testing the ice . Suddenly the dry tap changed to a sucking sound ! His staff sank straight into the ice , and a black star spread over the ice , marking the hole where the staff had disappeared . The figure backed slowly toward shore again , shaking his head and muttering . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried Betty . But the wind was against them and shout as loudly as they could , they could n't make him notice . <p> The wind flung itself down the wide , glassy riverbed in great gusts . A starless night crept in around them . Up on the hill , Mother lighted a lamp and set it in the window . Gratefully Bob and Betty turned toward the light . The cottage looked serene and welcoming now . They warmed their stiff toes by the stove , and their hearts within the glow of the lamp . <p> Supper did n't take long . What with the woolly sleeping clothes and extra sweaters they had brought , there had n't been room for much food . Mother had planned to supplement it at the store . She put aside three dishes of beans and two crackers each , for their breakfast . " Now , chicks , you take your choice between going for wood and going to bed . This fire 's nearly out . For my part I 'm going to bed . I 'd rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The children , full of fresh air and dinner , agreed . They undressed quickly and squirmed in between warm blankets , on the cots Mother had brought into the living room . <p> Betty never could tell afterwards what her dream had been , but something lifted her bodily out of a deep sleep . She awoke to find herself in the middle of the room , fumbling for the flashlight . <p> An insistent knocking sounded at the door . Who would come through the night to a shut-up summer cottage ? Above the sound of knocking rose a wild wail . Bob burrowed under the covers as he heard it and Mother tossed in her sleep . <p> " Come in ! " Betty tried to speak in her normal voice , but it quaked in spite of her . <p> Maybe whoever it was could n't hear her . She summoned her courage and , pointing the flashlight at the door , turned the knob . A white whirlwind flung the door wide open , wrenching it from her grasp , and rushed in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepers . <p> " Who 's at the door ? " cried Mother , suddenly waking . <p> The wind and the snow surrounded them , scattering papers , clutching at the tablecloth . " Stop throwing water , " muttered Bob , only half-awake . <p> It took all three of them , pushing together , to shut the door . " I thought somebody wanted to come in , " Betty explained shamefacedly . <p> The knocking began again and the wailing wind rose above it . <p> " Winter wanted to come in , " said Mother with forced cheerfulness . But Betty was wide-awake enough to notice how unnatural her voice sounded . <p> The next morning , they hardly recognized the world to which they awakened . Snow was piled against doors and windows . A white , trackless landscape surrounded them . Mother pushed out to the woodshed , through drifts that reached to her waist . She came in , panting , her face white and serious . " Do you realize what this means ? " she asked . <p> The children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , uncomprehending . <p> " It means Father ca n't come , and that 's all we have to eat until we are dug out , " Mother said , pointing to the beans . <p> " But it 's Thanksgiving ! " Bob cried . A vision , red with cranberries and golden brown with turkey , rose before him . Tears glistened under his lashes . <p> " Try to tell the north wind that , " scoffed Betty , trying to be a Spartan . <p> After two hours of digging , they reached the road . Mother hoped a farmer in a sleigh might pass by . If only there was a telephone within walking distance ! But everywhere fallen trees and tangled telephone wires bore witness to the storm 's strength . She returned to the cottage to stoke her fire , stationing the children on the store steps in case someone did venture down the road . The children waited in vain . <p> Bob felt miserable ! Even more than his hunger , the thought that he had given Betty a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnawed at him . If only he could do something like shoot a rabbit , they 'd have something for Thanksgiving dinner . Aloud he said , " Wonder what 's in those cans in the store . We might break a window and crawl in and find out . " <p> " Not food , I 'll bet , " Betty cautioned . Be tty always took the punch out of his ideas . He got up haughtily and started for the cottage . He felt an idea coming on now , and he did n't want to tell her about it and let her pick it apart before he worked it out . <p> As he trudged through the snow , his plan took shape . The Indian might help , if only they could let him know they needed him . Bob considered his red mackinaw , brilliant against the snow . Red was the color hunters wore , because it showed up in the forest . Perhaps he could signal with it ! No chance of plowing down to the riverbank to wave , though ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A pine branch brushed his face and with it an idea , as brilliant as Bob 's coat , flashed into his mind . But before he could carry it out , Betty dashed up , waving a can . <p> " I thought it would n't be wrong to break in to keep us alive . Look ! I found the only one . We can pay for it later . " <p> She rushed ahead to show Mother the can of beans she had found . Bob followed somberly-the can of beans had been his idea . Mother was delighted . And the beans , divided evenly , gave them something to eat for lunch . Betty chatted blithely , but Bob did not speak . He chewed his beans slowly , as though he were chewing on an idea at the same time . After lunch , Mother said everybody had better take a nap . They would n't get hungry again so soon if they did n't exercise , she explained . She and Betty squirmed into their blankets and soon slept . Bob leaned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping soundly . He was taking no chances of an interruption . He knew his plan was dangerous . After a while , he coughed to see if they would stir . <p> Assured that they would not awaken , he slipped out of bed , tied his red mackinaw around his neck and taking his shoes in his hand , he softly opened the door . A resolute frown deepened between his eyes . It was cold work lacing his shoes on the porch , but he had to be sure that he was escaping unheard . <p> Quickly he pushed through the snow , until he reached the pine tree that had brushed his face a few hours ago . It was a tall , old tree with branches alternating neatly in steps . Up he went , climbing from branch to branch , in spite of the snow that slid down his neck and sleeves and into his eyes and mouth . His hands were numb with cold , but he did n't dare wear mittens , because he needed his fingers to hold on . His teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over the bluff . <p> He clung to the trees with one hand while he untied his mackinaw sleeves with the other . Then , wriggling out near the end of the branch , he knotted his coat around it like a banner . And , yes , there across the river was the Indian , locking his door as though starting on a journey . He fastened on snowshoes and slid off over the snow without looking back ! <p> Bob tried to untie his coat , but he could n't manage it because his fingers ached so . He had been too determined to feel afraid on the climb up . Now , looking down had made him dizzy , and it was doubly disheartening to know that he had failed . As his foot felt for the branch below him and missed it , his stiff hands slipped . He clutched desperately at a clump of needles , dangled a moment on a broad branch , and then dropped fifteen feet into a drift below ! <p> It knocked the breath out of him , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though it could not prevent a broken heart . He lay back gasping , regardless of the tears that froze on his cheeks and his blue fingers . He had failed , and his red coat waved mockingly above him ! <p> Suddenly , into that cold silence , crept the hum of an airplane . Louder and louder it grew , filling the air and echoing back from the hills on the opposite shore . Across Bob 's patch of sky swept the Chicago mail plane , undaunted by the snow . <p> The plane flew so low that he could read the marking on the wings . For an instant , the plane paused and something dropped from it , something that blossomed into an umbrella , while Bob watched . It swayed balloon-like above him . Then slowly , steadily , the umbrella slipped through the air , down , down , past the waving red coat to the boy in the snow . Bob rubbed the tears from his eyes so he could see . Why , that was a parachute fluttering above his head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet and caught it as it fell . The sack was addressed to Mother in Father 's handwriting . And wonder upon wonder , as he hugged it and trudged home , he smelled a fragrant odor of turkey through the wrappings . <p> " Mother ! Mother ! Open it quick and tell me if I can believe my nose ! " cried Bob . <p> Selma had kept her word about the turkey , although there was n't room for anything else in the sack but salted peanuts . And pinned to the turkey 's bosom lay a letter . <p> " Dear family , " Father wrote , " roads are impassable . I tried to get to the store by phone and found it closed . Will snow plow through as soon as possible . Meanwhile , Horton says he 'll drop this going over and will bring more coming back . My only fear is that the blizzard has hidden landmarks . If this comes straight through , put up a signal . Cheerio . " <p> " And that 's why ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty suspiciously . Bob led them to the window and pointed to his mackinaw waving from high up in the pine tree . " I just thought I 'd run up a flag in case anyone was looking our way . " He did n't deem it wise to mention that he 'd fallen out of the tree before the parachute fell . <p> What a meal they made ! Nobody even thought of mentioning the chestnut stuffing and cranberries and pumpkin pie that had been too bulky for the plane to bring . <p> Mother said , " Anyway , I 'm so thankful I have n't room to overeat today ! " <p> " But turkey 's more filling than thanks , " added Bob . And Betty chimed in , " I 'd have sprouted if I had to swallow another bean ! " <p>
