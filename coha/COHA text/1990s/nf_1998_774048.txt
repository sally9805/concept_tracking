txt // that a human disease was caused by a microorganism . Gruby identified the species Trichophyton schoenleinii as the cause of a disease known as favus or ringworm . In so doing he preceded the much ballyhooed pioneering work on the germ theory of disease by Lister , Pasteur , and Koch by forty years . But , alas , as luck so often has it , this landmark contribution to biological science , advanced through knowledge of the fungi , has been overshadowed by work on lesser microbes deemed more newsworthy by medical historians . ' Today , a typical medical mycology compendium lists about one hundred different human pathogens . In addition , many more species trigger allergic reactions when spores are inhaled by people with a special sensitivity to them . Curiously , most of the fungi that cause diseases of humans are classified as " mitosporic fungi . " They either have no sexual stage , or , if one exists , it simply has n't been discovered yet . Where the sexual stage has been found , the fungi usually belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fungi related to the mushrooms have been identified , but there are unconfirmed reports that other such diseases have occurred . Some respiratory pathogens are also members of the primitive Oomycota . The field of medical mycology and the list of mycoses have expanded so rapidly in recent times for several reasons . First , people in the medical community are simply more aware of the role of fungi in the cause of disease , and they have better tools to use in their search for them . When faced with a puzzling diagnosis today , a diagnostician is more likely to consider fungi as the culprits than she might have been ten or twenty or fifty years ago . In addition , the once laborious processes of culturing a suspect pathogenic fungus from diseased tissue , identifying it , and proving its pathogenicity have been supplemented and in some cases replaced with more accurate , rapid , and reliable assays . A second cause for steadily increasing rates of incidence of fungal diseases as well as deaths due to them is that increased international travel has allowed humans and pathogens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , MYCOSES especially those in the Tropics , seem to harbor more fungal pathogens of humans , and increased travel to and from these countries has enabled more people to come in contact with more pathogenic fungi . A third factor contributing to increases in mycotic diseases has to do with drug therapy used to manage some of the most pressing human health problems of our time . Modern chemistry has provided an array of powerful compounds that help transplant patients to accept their new organs and to prolong the lives of cancer patients by depressing their immune systems . An unfortunate side effect of using these drugs is that the body 's normally effective defenses against fungal pathogens are weakened , and the likelihood of contracting a mycotic disease is increased . Thus , such therapies are often accompanied by one or more antifungal drugs as well . The relentless spread of AIDS through the world 's population has also left a trail of frail , weakened bodies that are highly susceptible to infections by fungi that might otherwise have little or no effect on the human system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more fungus diseases . Dr. Michael Rinaldi of the University of Texas aptly describes the situation this way : " Given the right immunocompromised host , virtually any fungus can kill a human being . In a real sense , such individuals become living petri dishes . " Finally , as people live longer , even if they are in otherwise good health , their immune systems generally start to deteriorate , and they are , as with people on immunosuppressive drugs , more likely to contract fungal diseases . Those predisposed by a congenital condition such as diabetes are at even greater risk . Some of the more common mycoses are described below . DERMATOMYCOSES-DISEASES OF SKIN The most common mycoses , those best known and most frequently contracted by people , are the dermatomy coses ? diseases of the skin and other keratinired tissues . Ath-101 // lete 's foot , mentioned at the beginning of this chapter , is one good example . It is actually caused by one of three closely related fungi and almost always starts in the webbing between the fourth and fifth toes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot and , very rarely , to other parts of the body . Other dermatomy coses include jock itch ( infection of skin on the inner thighs ) and ringworm of the hair , skin , or nails . Ringworm is n't really caused by worms , of course , though it was once believed to be . The lesions on the skin develop as discrete circles with raised red margins and were assumed to be due to burrowing worms . Today we know better , but the name persists . Medical specialists know ringworms by terms such as tinea capitis ( head ) , tinea pedis ( feet ) , and tinea unguium ( nails ) . The all-too-familiar jock itch is also a form of ringworm : tinea cruris . Each of the dermatomy coses is caused by a fungus in one of two closely related genera , Microsporum or Trichophyton , and each fungus is very specific in its ability to attack skin on just a limited part of the body . Animals can also contract ringworm of skin and hair , and these fungi readily spread to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no serious consequences and are easily managed with appropriate medications . Some dermatomy coses , like athlete 's foot and jock itch , are products of our modern lifestyle . In more primitive cultures , where shoes and tight-fitting clothes are not the norm , these diseases are virtually nonexistent . However , the warm , moist environments associated with garb worn by more civilized peoples provide ideal places for fungus cultures to flourish . And as any victim of their appetites can attest , they do ! Fortunately , the fungi usually succumb to any of a wide array of over-the-counter , topical fungicides . However , the key to complete cure is continued treatment well beyond the time when itching regresses or lesions heal . Unfortunately , most people stop too soon . The fungi are suppressed but not eradicated and recurrence of these diseases is common . ' // CANDIDIASIS : YEAST INFECTIONS AND THRUSH Another mycotic disease , one that occurs with great frequency and generally causes its victims far greater discomfort than the dermatomy coses , is commonly referred to as a yeast infection or candidiasis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human mouth and throat , colon , and reproductive organs , where it lives in a delicate competitive balance with bacteria and other microflora of the digestive tract . Under most circumstances , it causes no known disease . However , when people are predisposed by some other factor such as diabetes , old age , pregnancy , and so forth , C. albicans can cause symptoms ranging from merely uncomfortable to life threatening . ' Skin and mucosal membranes in and around the genitalia seem to be especially susceptible to colonization by Candida . Women are particularly susceptible , so much so that it is unusual for a woman to go through her reproductive years without at least one significant yeast infection . For many women , recurrence of the disease one or more times each year causes not only unwanted physical irritation but emotional distress as well . Prolonged use of orally administered antibiotics , birth control pills , or steroids is a significant contributing factor , altering body chemistry and thus tipping environmental conditions against other microbes in favor of Candida . A creamy white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence . Usually , a combination of changes in dietary habits , clothing , and/or medications , together with administration of drugs designed specifically to suppress Candida growth , are sufficient to eliminate symptoms . Yeast infections of male genitalia , known to physicians as balanitis , also occur but are far less common than those in women . Candida also causes a disease of the mouth and throat in infants , the elderly , and some cancer patients . Of the latter , those preparing for bone marrow transplants seem to be at highest 103 // risk for contracting the disease IncI can expect some added discomfort from it . Oral candidiasis is called thrush , and it presents as a creamy white-to-gray membranous film on the tongue and oral cavity . Infants who become infected usually do so ( luring passage through the birth canal of an infected mother . Once a newborn reaches the age of three days , it becomes immune to infection of the oral cavity until much later in life . In the elderly , diabetes or prolonged exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics favor development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains unchecked it could cause ulceration and swelling of the throat which could , in turn , impede swallowing and breathing . Candidiasis of the scalp , fingers , lungs , and upper gastrointestinal tract and anus have also been reported , but these diseases are rare . Usually , the fungus remains localized in whatever part of the body it first developed , but systemic infections ( where Candida is carried throughout the body in blood ) have occasionally been reported . For that reason ? and for many others ? yeast infections should not go untreated . ? More Irritating than You Thought ? Since the mid-1980s , several physicians have reported that while treating female patients for candidiasis , they seem to have inadvertently ? at first ? relieved symptoms of other problems . These include premenstrual syndrome , sexual dysfunction ? ranging from nymphomania to loss of libido ? and depression . They hypothesize that the cause and effect are not just coincidental but that , in fact , some traditionally psychological disorders may be the consequences of above normal populations of C. albicans . Dr. W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pioneers in this area of medical investigation , suggests several possible mechanisms for the unexpected effects of the yeast . ' They include toxin production by C. albicans , yeast-induced nutrient imbalance , and ethyl alcohol fermentation . Critics of Crook 's work argue that evidence to support his contentions is wanting . In fact , clinical trials comparing reactions of patients treated with or without the 104 MYCosEs antifungal drug nystalin showed no differences in the test populations . Nonetheless , the debate continues , with a small but vocal cadre of medical professionals convinced that C. al hicans is responsible for much more disease than it gets credit for SPOROTRICHOSIS Another mycotic disease of skin , this one characterized by deep-seated , subcutaneous ulcers much different from the ringworms , is sporotrichosis . This disease is caused by Sporothrix schenckii , a common inhabitant of organic soil , peat , and rotted wood . Sporotrichosis was first described in the medical litera ture by B. R. Schenck , who reported a case in the United States in 1898 . Shortly thereafter , clinicians in France made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is now known throughout the world . The record for the greatest num ber of cases in the shortest period of time appears to go to South Africa , where over three thousand workers in a Johannesburg gold mine contracted the disease in 1g45-46.5 Fortunately , the disease was properly diagnosed , the mine timbers and miners were treated with appropriate fungicides , and disease incidence plummeted . Today , sporotrichosis seems to be most prevalent among farmers , nursery and greenhouse workers , and home gardeners ? the people most likely to be exposed to infested debris . S. schenckii is introduced into people through wounds ; it can-not penetrate intact skin . One common injury sustained by gar deners is a prick from a rose thorn , but any wound ? even one caused by metal ? could provide a route for entry . Greenhouse workers using infested peat may also contract the disease if they have open sores of any type on their fingers or arms . 105 // Lesions induced by S. sekenrkii are usually restricted to the immediate area of infection where they remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meantime , lymph nodes at increasingly greater distances from the actual site of infection may become swollen and tender . In rare cases , the disease has been reported to go systemic , causing secondary lesions elsewhere on the skin or on mucosal membranes of the nose or mouth . Sporotrichosis can be difficult to diagnose because the disease is generally uncommon and not likely to be considered first among the possibilities entertained by most physicians . However , once it has been diagnosed , treatment is straightforward and effective . Where the disease is a known threat , workers are advised to wear gloves to cover existing wounds and reduce the chance for new wounds . RESPIRATORY DISEASES Cryptococcosis There is a wide array of fungi with the capacity to serve as human respiratory pathogens . Many , including the three chosen for discussion here , are not just limited to the lungs but may be disseminated to other parts of the body as well . First is cryptococcosis , caused by Cryptococcus neoformans.6 The disease has been known since the late 1800s , having been first associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of skin lesions , meningitis , and pulmonary dysfunction . Exposure to the pathogen and the potential for disease begin when spores of the fungus are inhaled by an unwitting victim . Most otherwise healthy people are apparently resistant to the fungus , but in a suitably predisposed person the spores can begin to grow in the lungs when inhaled . From there C. neoformans can enter the bloodstream and be carried throughout the body to cause lesions on the skin and in the // bones , abdomen , and , especially , the central nervous system . There it causes cryptococcal meningitis , a usually lethal condition . As with many other human diseases caused by fungi , cryptococcosis is most severe in people predisposed by other factors . The disease occurs more often than would be expected by chance in people with leukemia and diabetes , and in patients being treated with steroids . Hodgkin 's disease patients are also more likely to contract cryptococcosis . In fact , symptoms of the two diseases are so similar in some respects that one has been mistaken for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more likely than females to get the disease . People who work in and around areas where there are large quantities of pigeon dung are also at higher risk than others to contract cryptococcosis because the fungus grows well and reproduces abundantly on that substrate. ? Laboratory results have shown that one gram of basic ordinary pigeon dung can yield up to 50 million spores . Hopefully , designers of buildings in today 's big cities will keep those numbers in mind as they exercise their visions of form and function of these sire ores . Histoplasmosis Another human respiratory disease is caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum . As in the case of cryptococcosis , histoplasmosis ? as this disease is called ? is commonly associated with exposure to bird feces.8 Spores of H. capsulatum are inhaled , and the fungus begins its life as a human pathogen in the lungs of its victims . As the lungs are colonized , symptoms resemble those caused by tuberculosis , and without treatment , the disease can be fatal . Fortunately , it rarely is . Chicken farmers are the highest-risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support growth of the pathogen . But urban residents living in areas where high populations of starlings roost are also at risk . As these words are 107 // penned , famed singer-songwriter Bob Dylan lies critically ill with a serious case of histoplasmosis that has caused inflammation of the sac surrounding his heart . To many previously uninformed people throughout the world , Mr. Dylan 's misfortune has brought an awareness of the serious threats fungi can pose if they are ignored . Aspergillosis A third respiratory mycosis , aspergillosis , is caused by the action of one or more of eight different species of molds in the genus Aspergillus.9 A. fumigatus is the most common culprit , but other species including A. flavus , A. niger , and A. ochraceous may be involved . Spores and mycelial fragments of these fungi commonly trigger asthmatic allergic reactions but they may also become invasive , causing areas of dead cells on the lungs that can expand and ultimately be fatal if unchecked . Repeated exposure to certain species of Aspergillus seems to weaken the human body 's ability to cope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to molds on barley develop " malt worker 's lung " and farmers who are routinely exposed to moldy hay develop " farmer 's lung . " Some office buildings with faulty or dirty air conditioners also contain hazardous , spore-laden environments . SYSTEMIC MYCOSES : COCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS Of all the fungus-caused diseases of humans , the systemic pathogens clearly pose some of the greatest threats . One of the most common is coccidioidomycosis caused by Coccidiomyces immitis.10 The fungus grows in desert areas throughout the Western Hemisphere from Argentina to California , and coccidioidomycosis has been reported from all of these regions . In the United States , incidence of this disease in he San Joaquin // Valley of California is so high that it has become known there as " Valley fever . " The " official " name of the disease has a curious history . Ernest Dickson , who did much of the early work on coccidioidomycosis , was a bit of a poet as well as a medical mycologist , and he was compelled to make the name of this disease pleasing to the ear when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more logical name of " coccidiomycosis , " he added an extra " ido " to give us " coccidioidomycosis . " And in that spirit , the following jingle was often presented as part of a tribute to this early work . Some fungi produce a mycosis Like blasto- or histoplasmosis But for musical sake The one I will take Is coccidioidomycosis. 11 Because of generally arid conditions in the southwestern United States , fungal growth and sporulation are somewhat limited there . However , in seasons or years with above average rainfall , fungal development is also more likely , and the potential threat from mycoses becomes higher . When you combine favorable weather for fungal activity with an increasing population of potential hosts as more and more elderly people move to the desert , the stage is set for a possibly serious epidemic of the disease . Under natural conditions , spores are lifted into the air by wind and dust . However , human activities such as farming and construction , which tend to loosen soil and accelerate wind erosion , also encourage liberation of C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1994 , 208 cases of coccidioidomycosis were attributed to the enormous amount of dust ( and spores ) raised by the quake . ' Three people died from the disease after contracting it during the upheaval . The primary route of C. immitis into the body is via the in-109 // halation of spores . As with the aforementioned respiratory mycoses , most otherwise healthy people may develop a slight cough upon infection , but their immune systems will otherwise effectively stop the fungus soon after entry , leaving ? if anything ? little more than a barely discernible lesion in the lung . However , if the fungus is able effectively to colonize its host , more serious symptoms may present after a seven- to twentyeight-day incubation period . A patient may then experience symptoms including fever , chest pains similar to a broken rib or heart attack , shortness of breath , coughing , malaise , and fatigue . Brief episodes of anorexia are also common , with weight Joss of 20 to 30 pounds over a two- to three-week period . The fungus may also be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing disseminated lesions in the skin , subcutaneous tissues , bones ( including joints ) , and guts . Coccidioidomycosis may eventually be fatal , but more often it does n't progress beyond the very earliest stages . As the medical community becomes more aware of the existence of the disease and techniques for diagnosing it , early detection will surely continue to keep the disease from causing serious illness in most patients . Control of fungal pathogens of humans is much more difficult than control of bacterial diseases because the chemistry of fungal cells is so much more like that of human cells . As a result , many early efforts to control mycoses with chemicals did so much damage to the healthy cells of the patient that they had to be abandoned . And even some of those used today cause the the patient to suffer excruciating side effects . The first real breakthrough in therapy for mycoses occurred in 1951 , when researchers searching for new chemicals to control fungal diseases of plants came across a chemical that had been discovered almost twenty-two years earlier . The chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtrr.rlly ignored since its discovery because the scientist who lirruul it was looking for chemicals to kill bacteria , and this one had no elffect on them . ' " IHn MYCOSES At first , the chemical , called griseofulvin , was only effective in controlling fungus disease of plants , but shortly thereafter it was also determined to alleviate symptoms of fungus diseases of humans and other animals . The results were astounding . A man suffering from ringworm of the scalp for sixty years was completely cured by taking griseofulvin . And an eight-year-old girl who , for her entire life , had been afflicted by a type of ringworm that covered her whole body , including her skin , hair , and nails , began to improve with griseofulvin therapy . Similar stories poured in from all over the world , and word of the success of griseofulvin spread . At one point , enthusiasm for griseofulvin was so high that medical specialists were predicting complete eradication of ringworm of the scalp in just a few more years . But griseofulvin proved to be a bit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cured infections on the skin and hair but had no effect on mycoses of internal organs . Furthermore , for some mysterious reason it worked best on diseases of the scalp but not quite as well on mycoses of the upper torso , becoming progressively less effective in the lower extremities . Fungus infections of the foot were virtually untouched by it . Nonetheless , griseofnlvin was a welcome addition to a meager list of strategies fe nr:uraging skin-infecting fungi . Two other materials in what might 1w considered the first generation of antifungal drugs were Anrphotericin B and Nystatin . Both of these drugs were produced by organisms known as actinomycetes , and they proved to be effective in many cases where griseofulvin failed . Amphotericin B was particularly effective for the treatment of the deep-seated , systemic mycoses such as coccidioidomycosis , but it was accompanied by such unpleasant side effects that many who used it came to know it as " Ampho the Terrible . " Nystatin was discovered by Elizabeth Lee Hazen and Rachel Brown , scientists who were trying to isolate antibiotics from Streplom'ycrs nourse ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against fungi , they named their new drug " fungicidin " but learned later that the word had already been used by someone else to desig-111 // nate another compound . The current name , Nystatin , was then conceived in partial tribute to New York State because it was extracted there and both women were employed by the state 's health department . Newer chemicals focus on disrupting the ability of pathogenic fungi to synthesize cell wall material . In particular , they impede conversion of the chemical lanosterol to ergosterol , an important fungal cell wall component derived from a chemical reaction that does not occur in human cells . " This results in drugs specifically targeting fungal cell chemistry , with few if any side effects for the humans who use them . One such compound that has shown good promise for treatment of yeast infections is cilofungin , another by-product of another fungus ? this one a species of Aspergillus . In finishing this chapter on mycoses , be comforted by the fact that while there is a vast array of fungi with the potential to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is predisposed by other factors . Mycoses are often difficult to diagnose but fortunately are rarely fatal for otherwise healthy people . Thus , patients who wait for diagnoses should not have to worry about life hanging in the balance . And , with most mycoses , changes in lifestyle combined with a growing arsenal of antifungal drugs can usually be used to effect a complete cure . 112 // Medicinal Molds The preceding chapters and their extended descriptions of fungi as incitants of plant and animal diseases and all the misery associated with them may have led you to believe that you were right about fungi to begin with : they are rotten , disgusting , vile creations , hell bent on mucking up what is otherwise a pretty good life on Planet Earth . Let me assure you that for all the problems the fungi have caused , they have also extended our lives and made them far more enjoyable . The remaining chapters in this book should convince you of that . If not , stop by my office in Cornell 's Plant Science Building . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The subject of this chapter is the fungi that enrich our lives by providing us with a pharmacopoeia that counts antibiotics , cholesterol-reducing drugs , and antitumor agents among its wondrous life-saving stores . In previous chapters , two such groups of drugs ? the vasoconstrictors produced by the ergot fungus , and the fungicide griseofulvin from Penicillium griseofulvum ? received some attention . Here you will learn about many more , some of which defy laboratory synthesis and are available only as they are extracted from fungi grown in culture . PENICILLIN The first of these medical marvels is the stuff of which legends are made , and I daresay that not one reader has escaped its influence ( fig. 8.1 ) . It was discovered quite by accident in the laboratory of I ) r . Alexander Fleming , a medical research scientist at St. Mary 's 11osl ) ital in London . Fleming was interested in 113 // bacterial pathogens of humans , and in the course of his work he grew cultures of the bacteria ? thousands of cultures ? in petri dishes containing a nutrient-enriched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleming slid one plate after another onto the stage of his microscope and then off again , he was visited by a col-league , Professor Merlin Pryce . As Pryce entered the room , Fleming glanced at him briefly , but then resumed his work while carrying on a conversation . Suddenly Fleming stopped , and after a moment 's observation said in his usual unconcerned tone , " That 's funny .... " A contaminating mold was growing on MEDICINAL MOLDS the petri dish he was viewing . Sterile laboratory conditions being what they were in 1928 , contamination by molds was hardly a rare occurrence . But on this particular culture , the bacteria surrounding the mold were dissolved . Instead of forming typical opaque yellow masses , they looked like drops of dew . Immediately , Fleming transferred a piece of the mold to a new test tube because obviously he thought it had some importance . " What struck me , " said Pryce , recounting the episode years later , " was that he did n't confine himself to observing , but took action at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be important , but they do n't get beyond being surprised , after which they forget . That was never the case with Fleming . " I One thing that undoubtedly piqued Fleming 's interest in this particular mold was that the bacterium he was trying to grow , the one being killed , was a known pathogen of humans . A few years earlier , Fleming had discovered a chemical in mucus and in tears that could destroy bacteria that were not pathogenic to humans . But this was the first time he had found a chemical ? albeit a fungal metabolite ? that was apparently able to suppress a pathogenic microbe . Could this possibly be the long-soughtafter and hoped-for silver bullet to cure human ills ? Fleming immediately put the rest of his research on hold and dived head first into experiments to learn more about this new mold and its juice . One of the first things he discovered was that the mold was antagonistic to not just one but a variety of human pathogens . And , much to his delight , Fleming learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injected into test animals . When it came time to get a proper identification of this special mold , the services of a young Irish mycologist who just happened to be visiting the laboratory were sought . He identified it as Penicillium rubrum , and that was the name used in Fleming 's first reports of his amazing discovery . Much later , the fungus was determined actually to be Penicillium notatum. 115 // As the properties of the mold juice became better known , it occurred to Fleming that the substance ought to have a proper name . He chose the letters p/e/n/i/c/i/l/l/i/n , after the name of the genus of fungi producing it . But how to pronounce this word ? Alas ! In the true spirit of democracy , the issue was put to a vote of his colleagues . By a count of 7 to 3 , we now know it as penicillin ; the minority vote being for the alternativepenicillin.2 Fleming 's enthusiasm for his new discovery continued to grow but the progress of his experiments was slowed by his inability to obtain sufficient quantities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments in culture dishes . At one point , he employed the services of two young doctors with some extra training in chemistry , and they wrestled for several years with the problem of trying to increase the yield of penicillin , finally giving up in frustration . Much later , historians would record that at the time they quit , they had mastered all but a final , somewhat trivial , step in the purification of penicillin and were just a hair 's breadth away from success . ' The trouble was that penicillin , the chemical , was just too unstable . It was easy to grow the mold in liquid broth and get an extract with antibacterial properties , but that extract contained other chemical by-products of fungal growth in addition to penicillin , and those other chemicals triggered toxic reactions in test animals . When , by chance , a relatively pure fraction of penicillin was obtained , it lost all activity within a week . These difficulties persisted for ten more years , but finally , in 1939 , the task of purifying the drug attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chain of Oxford University . Chain was a chemist , and after innumerable failed attempts to isolate penicillin following traditional protocols , he tried using a relatively new technique ? freeze drying ? to separate unwanted extraction fluids from the desired product . It worked . A crystalline residue remained , and when Florey tested the sub- // stance against bacteria in culture dishes , it killed them . When injected into test animals , it caused no ill effects . Unfortunately , the scientists scarcely had time to enjoy their success before an event of far greater import overtook them . In June 1940 , the Germans began their great offensive across the European mainland . Was England going to be invaded ? No one knew , but the Oxford team ? which is what Chain , Florey , and their colleagues were now called ? decided not to take any chances . They agreed that at all costs they must plan to save the miraculous mold which now held such obvious promise for battling a variety of diseases . In one desperate gesture , they dusted the linings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if something did happen to their lab or to them , at least one of them could escape with spores of the precious mold for future work . As it turned out , the war did not slow the work of the Oxford team as much as initially expected , and by the end of June 1940 they had extracted enough penicillin for a crucial test . Then , fifty white mice were given a lethal injection of a virulent Streptococcus . Twenty-five served as controls and received no further treatment . The others were treated with penicillin every three hours over a period of two days and two nights . Florey and his assistant slept in the laboratory , waking every two hours to check on the mice . At the end of sixteen hours , all of the untreated mice were dead , while twenty-four of the twenty-five treated with penicillin remained alive.4 The choice of mice for this experiment was especially fortuitous . If Florey had chosen guinea pigs instead of mice , penicillin research may have been stopped dead in its tracks . For some still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a toxic reaction on the test animals would most certainly have squelched the enthusiasm of the Oxford team.5 With their first animal trials behind them , the scientists decided it was time to try their new drug on a human being . At that 117 // very moment , a case of such desperate proportions presented itself that a daring experiment was proposed . The patient was an Oxford policeman who was dying of blood poisoning caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus . The pathogen had entered his body through a small cut on his mouth , incurred while he was shaving , and had since gone systemic . He had superficial ulcers all over his trunk and limbs and his lungs were failing . The attending physicians regarded his condition as hopeless and agreed to allow treatment with the penicillin . On February 12 , 1941 , an intravenous injection of 200 mg of the mold juice was given to the dying man . Thereafter , he received an injection of 10o mg every three hours . By the end of twenty-four hours , the improvement in his condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to heal , and he began to feel better . He even sat up in bed and began to eat . Unfortunately , the meager supply of purified penicillin was dwindling fast . Some of it was recovered from the man 's urine and reused , but two facts became painfully obvious . First , if the penicillin treatment continued , the man would undoubtedly be saved . But second , the treatment could not be continued because the supplies were almost exhausted . Eventually , there was none left and the man died . The members of the Oxford team were saddened but not discouraged , and they set about to make more penicillin for future clinical tests . The next two patients , whose conditions were also judged to be as desperate as the policeman 's , were completely cured . Another , an eight-year-old child , was well on the road to recovery when a blood vessel in her brain ruptured and she died of a cerebral hemorrhage . But the penicillin had done its job . All that was needed now was a way to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . British factories , preoccupied with manufacturing war materials , were unable to meet the challenge , so Florey headed to the United States . There he found his way to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria , Illinois . Among other // things , scientists at this lab were trying to find ways to turn organic waste from the processing of agricultural products into something useful . One of those waste products was corn steep liquor , a stinky , sticky goo left over when starch is extracted from corn . The stuff had accumulated in the region to an embarrassing extent , and workers at the lab had experimented with it as a substrate for growing other species of Penicillium . With corn steep liquor as the substrate for P. notatum , the lab staff quickly obtained an output of penicillin twenty times greater than that obtained in Oxford , and the last hurdle appeared to have been cleared . Researchers at the Peoria lab also contributed in other ways to the evolution of penicillin as we know it today . For one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might produce higher quantities of penicillin . Armed forces pilots traveling to the far reaches of the globe were given the mysterious order to scoop up a bit of soil at each of their landing spots and return it to Peoria as soon as they could . Penicillium species were then isolated from these samples and tested for their productivity . The USDA team also hired a young woman who , among other things , was to go to the market periodically and gather samples of all the moldy produce she could find . " Moldy Mary , " as she became known , returned one day with a culture of Penicillium chrysogenum from a rotten cantaloupe . It proved to be remarkably productive , and many of the strains used today come from that rotten Peoria melon . Within a few years , techniques for the production of penicillin had been perfected , just in time to save thousands of lives of the Allied Forces fighting in the last stages of World War II . Millions of others since then have either been saved or been spared the anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1945 , Fleming , Chain , and Florey won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their discoveries . Fleming was recognized for making the initial observations and conducting the first experiments using penicillin ; Chain was credited for 119 // doing the chemistry that allowed purification of stable forms of penicillin ; and Florey was honored for conducting and subsequently supervising clinical trials on use of the antibiotic to cure disease . From the outset , scientists working on the penicillin project recognized the immense importance of their work to the future of humankind . Though they and various agencies seemed willing to put the promise of personal fame and monetary gain aside in the interest of human welfare , work on the mold still took its personal toll . Florey and Chain , once close friends who walked home from work together each night talking science along the way , had a painful falling out in their later years as their strong personalities kept them from resolving contentious issues . And both felt that Fleming got far more credit than he deserved for his serendipitous place in the drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team lab ? " I understand you have been working with my mold " ? set the tone for an uneasy relationship that would evolve between him and the Oxford group . Pharmaceutical companies in both the United Kingdom and the United States who eventually learned to synthesize penicillin derivatives also engaged in prolonged and bitter legal wrangling over rights to the processes . Legal proceedings that had begun in 1959 were not finally resolved until 198o ! 6 Despite the occasional down side , however , the drama associated with the discovery and exploitation of penicillin remains one of the greatest episodes in the history of biology , if not in the history of civilized peoples . No doubt some of today 's finest scientists were inspired to pursue their chosen careers upon reading of the trials and tribulations of those engaged in penicillin research . One of the very significant offshoots associated with the discovery of penicillin was that it caused scientists to become acutely aware that mere microbes had the power to make chetnicals heretofore unknown to humanity . Furthermore , it was as- // sumed that penicillin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans . Thus scientists began to scour the landscape worldwide , isolating every microbe they could find , testing each for active metabolites . Penicillin was soon followed by griseofulvin , a chemical produced by the fungus Penicillium griseofulvum and , strangely enough , toxic to other fungi rather than bacteria . It quickly became and still is an important tool in the fight against human mycoses. ? As penicillin-resistant strains of bacteria emerged to challenge medical practitioners , a compound called cephalosporin was discovered . The fungus producing it was a species of Cephalosporium isolated from the coast of the island of Sardinia , at a site where a sewer was discharging waste into the Mediterranean Sea . That isolate continues to be the most important source of cephalosporins ( e.g. , Keflex ? ) to this day . At first , metabolites of fungi were the only chemicals of significant medicinal value to be unearthed by the search . Eventually , however , another whole group of antibiotic chemicals produced by filamentous , bacteria-like organisms known as actinomycetes were discovered . Actinomycin , streptomycin , chloromycetin , tetracycline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggered by Fleming 's observations . While it 's likely that microbes producing these other antibiotics would have eventually been discovered anyway , it 's equally likely that without penicillin to trigger the search , the others would have become known only precious years later . Unfortunately , there is a down side to the penicillin story . About to percent of the human population is allergic to the drug , and in some people the allergic reaction can result in death . Thus , even though prescription of penicillin to cure a myriad of childhood ills has become commonplace , for each child that first dose must be closely supervised . The other issue of concern with the now common use of antibiotics is that bacteria , the intended victims of these potent 121 // medicines , have begun to fight back . Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria have shown up with increasing frequency for two apparent reasons . ' First , such widespread use of the drugs has exerted a selective pressure on some bacterial populations in favor of tolerant individuals . Second , people taking antibiotics frequently fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better soon after treatment starts and stop before the prescribed time has elapsed . Thus , low levels of more tolerant cells survive to give rise to the next generation of pathogens . That generation is likely to carry the higher drug tolerance , thus challenging the skills of the medical community and winning the battle far too often . With the benefit of 20/2o hindsight and knowing about penicillin after the fact , one can find obscure references to a possible role played by penicillin in healing various maladies far back into time . Historical records show that as long as three thousand years ago , the Chinese put moldy soybean curd on boils and other skin infections . And papyrus scrolls from the sixteenth century B.C. indicate that Egyptians recommended rubbing moldy bread on all sorts of superficial lesions to speed healing . The French used moldy cheese for the same purpose , long before they discovered that the same cheese might actually taste good . In all cases , a prominent group of molds in the mix would have been species of Penicillium . In another noteworthy episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in Edinburgh was suffering from a wound caused by a road accident . Nothing seemed to be able to alleviate the girl 's suffering until the attending physician tried an experimental treatment that proved to be effective beyond all expectations . The girl was so thankful for this wonderful miracle that she asked the physician to write down the name of the treatment . The physician was none other than Joseph Lister , the father of antiseptic surgery . The treatment he wrote down was Penicillium . Apparently Lister used a crude mold extract to cure the girl of infection following her wound , but he made no other // notes to that effect , and there are very few additional details about his knowledge or use of the therapy . Before we leave the issue of molds and other microbes and their production of penicillin , let 's consider some obvious questions . Why would fungi produce potent antibiotic chemicals like those that have been described ? Are these chemicals of any value to the producer ? No one knows the answers for sure , but a likely possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fungus to gain a competitive advantage over the other microbes in the environment in which they live . Most of the fungi and other antibiotic-producing microorganisms live in the soil or in other complex environments with diverse microbial populations ? hostile places , to say the least . Any advantage over competitors for scarce organic food materials would probably improve survival , and antibiotic production is one such advantage . In more recent years , other kinds of drugs produced by fungi have found their way into the human pharmacopoeia . Some of special significance are the cyclosporins produced by several different molds , including Cylindrocarpon lucidum and Tolypocladium inflatum.9 Cyclosporin A ( Sandimmune " ) depresses activity of the human immune system enough to give implanted organs a better chance to become established . Were it not for the discovery of this drug , the science of organ transplants might not have progressed with near as much speed and success as it has . Cyclosporin has also been so effective as a treatment for diabetes that some patients have been able to stop insulin injections altogether . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many grateful patients who have been freed from further insulin injections have no complaints about that ! Another important class of drugs to emerge in recent years includes compactin and lovastatin.10 Compactin is produced by several species of Penicillium as well as Hypomyces , Paecilomyces , and ' l richoderma . Lovastatin is produced on a commercial scale by a culture of a strain of Aspewillus lerreus , but in nature it is pro-123 // duced by fungi in at least four other genera . Both drugs and derivatives thereof inhibit cholesterol synthesis by blocking the action of an enzyme , HMG-CoA reductase . Unobstructed , the enzyme mediates the formation of mevalonic acid , the basic building block of the cholesterol molecule . However , if the effectiveness of the enzyme is reduced by the aforementioned drugs , so are cholesterol formation and associated diseases in mammalian systems . Lovastatin , as Mevacor " , and prevastatin , a hydroxylated form of compactin marketed as Pravachol " , are already used extensively for their effectiveness in contributing to reduced incidence of heart disease caused by atherosclerosis . Other derivatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : FLESHY FUNGI FOR MEDICINAL USE As a changing political climate and improved technology allow for better communication with East Asian cultures , the rest of the world has an unprecedented opportunity to learn about medical treatments practiced for hundreds , if not thousands , of years . One such practice new to modern medicine is the human consumption of fleshy fungi to protect people from certain ills and to cure them of others . Two species seem to have found particular favor in this regard . One is the cultivated shiitake , Lentinula edodes ( plate I C ) , long known for the unique flavor it imparts to many Far East dishes . The other is Ling Zhi or reishi ( Ganoderma lucidum ) , a wood-decay fungus grown or collected only for medicinal purposes . Literature on the medicinal values of both species is voluminous , but most of the research has been conducted and published in China , or Japan and , until very recently , has been greeted with healthy skepticism in the West . Nonetheless , both Chinese and Japanese people continue to include fungi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do seem to live a long time with markedly reduced in-cidence of the vascular ills and cancers that plague the " West " of us. // In the case of shiitake , two extracts of the fungus have received the most attention . First is lentinan , a high molecular weight polysaccharide extracted from the cell walls of fruiting bodies or mycelia . The compound is comprised solely of glucose molecules joined together in a triple-helix arrangement . The complex physical structure is believed to be important in its activity . Lentinan was first isolated for study in 1969 , and at the time was found to have antitumor activity far greater than that exhibited by polysaccharides from other mushrooms . It apparently did not act directly against tumor cells , but rather enhanced the immune system of the host in several measurable ways . Since then , it has been found to activate natural killer cells , stimulate transformation of blood lymphocytes into lymphokine-activated killer cells , and enhance natural interferon and interleukin production . ) I In many instances , lentinan is more effective at slowing or arresting tumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents than if used alone . It also demonstrates some antiviral activity , having completely protected mice from what should have been a lethal dose of influenza virus . In one case , a patient testing positive for HIV but without AIDS showed significantly increased immune system function with a drip infusion of lentinan . The second component of shiitake to receive considerable attention in laboratory and clinical studies is L. edodes mycelium extract ( LEM ) . LEM is a preparation of powdered mycelium extract harvested before mushrooms begin to form . Chemically , it is a far more complex compound than lentinan , described as a protein-bound polysaccharide . Among other chemicals in the mix are at least five sugars ( mostly pentoses ) , nucleic acid derivatives , several members of the Vitamin B complex , ergosterol , and lignin . LEM seems to have greater potential as an antiviral agent than as an antitumor one . Results of in vitro tests have shown it to inhibit HIV infection of cultured human cells and enhance efli.cis of AZT against viral replication . In one cornprat study , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ducing giant cell formation . LEM has also shown promise in managing liver disease and improving liver function . The Ling Zhi mushroom of China and the reishi of Japan are one and the same , both common names for the wood-decaying bracket fungus , Ganoderma lucidum . The fungus has a long history in Chinese medicine , with vague references to it extending back as far as two thousand years before Christ . Then , and for about 2 500 years hence , it was believed to be the " herb of deathlessness . " Anyone fortunate enough to eat it would have a long life , if not immortality . For most of its history , reishi as a medical treatment has been the domain of Oriental herbalists . In recent years , however , interest in reishi has increased among Western health practitioners . Publication of the first English-language book on the subject , The Mysterious Reishi Mushroom by K. Matsumotto , in 1979 brought people in the Western world face to face with this ancient medical therapy.12 Since then , as biochemical prospecting has become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for their Pacific Rim counterparts , reishi has been the subject of increased scholarly research . Nonetheless , the list of ills cured or ameliorated by reishi is a bit overwhelming and beyond belief to even the most open-minded lateral thinkers . Terrance Willard lists numerous cancers , coronary heart disease , hypertension , bronchitis , hepatitis , arthritis , myasthenia gravis , and muscular dystrophy among the many diseases for which reishi will provide some measurable benefit . ' The list of active ingredients is equally long and diverse and in need of further study . In addition to G. lucidum , other species of Ganoderma native to North America , including G. tsugae ( plate 1 D ) , G. oregonense , and G. applanatum ? the well-known artist 's conk ? are purported to have some similar medicinal properties . Reishi , however , has a higher concentration of beneficial chemicals per unit weight and it remains the fungus of choice . Christopher Hobbs presents a long list of other fleshy fungi MEDICINAL MOLDS purported to cure or temper symptoms in a wide array of human ailments.14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus slowing tumor growth ; improve circulation and heart function ; and improve digestion . Some commonly found in North America with beneficial effects demonstrated in human clinical trials include the following : Laboratory studies with small mammals suggest that a large number of other fleshy fungi , especially mushrooms , have 127 // unique chemicals that may improve the quality and quantity of human life . If only a small portion of those suspected to produce beneficial medicines are found to do so , our store of treatments for many of our most stubborn ills will be greatly increased and diversified . Of all the fungi with potentially healthful effects , none has attracted more attention in recent years than the slimy , gelatinous life form known as " Kombucha . " This " organism " is the product of symbiotic growth of at least two yeasts , Pichia fermentans and Kloeckera apiculata , and at least two bacteria , Gluconobacter oxydans and Acetobacter aceti . The latter , A. aceti , produces a cellulose membrane that holds the rest of the organisms in a somewhat cohesive mass.15 When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Kombucha culture is transferred to a glass container already containing a quart of sugared green or black tea , the culture not only grows rapidly , but converts the tea to a supposedly flavorful and health- // ful beverage in one to two weeks . When drunk at a rate of about one and a half cups per day , Kombucha tea will , according to its proponents , cure people afflicted with AIDS , prevent the devel opment of cancer , lower blood pressure , improve sex drive , and otherwise turn a dull life into a new adventure . Most of these claims are substantiated only by anecdotal revelations from de-voted users or those trying to sell the cultures to new initiates . The drink has been popular in various parts of the world for at least two thousand years , so it might indeed have some benefi cial effects . Medical practitioners in the United States have cast a dim eye 129 // on Kombucha , publicly decrying its use because they fear the threat from contaminating microbes in the culture . Patients with cancer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already depressed and possibly unable to cope with accidental inhalation or ingestion of an otherwise benign fun gus or bacterium . It is also a concern that many of the molds likely to contaminate Kombucha cultures are producers of life-threatening mycotoxins . Thus the cure could be far worse than the disease . In concluding the chapter on fungi as producers of chemicals beneficial to human health , I am compelled to tell you about the common mold , Aspergillus niger . The fungus is found on rot- // ting food and other bits of organic matter in homes as well as outdoors , and it poses some threat because of its ability to produce aflatoxin and other life-threatening mycotoxins . But A. niger also produces an enzyme known as alpha-d-galactosidase , a chemical that , among other things , tends to suppress methane production in the human digestive tract . Obviously , if alpha-dgalactosidase could be harvested , purified , and packaged for large-scale distribution , it would find favor not only among the windy members of the human race but also those who must stand downwind of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvested from large-scale growth of the parent fungus . This unique product made from a fungal metabolite and now found on drugstore shelves throughout North America is yet another testimony to the immense potential for the fungi to improve the quality of our lives . 131 // Yeasts for Baking and Brewing It was August in a land that would eventually be known as Persia . And it was hot . Far in the future , people would look back upon the year and call it 12,042 B.C. Tamar returned to her tent to continue preparing her family 's stores for the com ing winter and was immediately panic stricken as her gaze fell on three bowls of wheat meal she had mixed with a bit of water earlier that morning . Their contents should have been poured onto a clay palette and left to dry in the afternoon sun . But these bowls had been forgotten by Tamar in her haste to attend to her ailing son . Now , five hours later , the contents had expanded to twice their original size and seemed to have come alive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was a phe nomenon not seen before by the earliest generations of civi lized people , so she was convinced that some evil spirit had invaded her flat bread in the hope of sneaking into her body as she ate . The prospect of finding more grain to replace this lot was bleak , so Tamar decided to make sure the grotesque mass was indeed spoiled before she discarded it . Apprehensively , she took a bite . Much to her surprise , a delightful , new flavor danced across her palate . The bread was much lighter than anything she had made previously , and she relished the ease with which her teeth cut through it . The taste captured her senses as no other food ever had . Eagerly , she took another bite and another and another . And then she rushed out into the plaza to share this miraculous gift from Mother Earth with her neighbors. // That story is n't true . I just made it up . But historians suspect that civilization 's first conscious brush with the unique group of fungi known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , life would never be the same . What had happened in these bowls ? Sometime during the grinding and mixing of the grain , perhaps when water was added , yeast spores must have found their way into the resultant dough . Because we now know that starch from the grain would not have allowed the yeasts to grow much , there must also have been a source of sugar ? perhaps honey . As the yeasts digested the sugar , they grew and multiplied and produced bubbles of carbon dioxide that were trapped in the moist dough , thus giving it its final light texture . The yeast cells also added a unique flavor that made Tamar 's serendipitous discovery a culinary marvel . But what about those yeasts ? What , pray tell , is so special about them ? Yeasts are like other fungi in that their cells contain true nuclei , their cell walls are of similar chemistry , and at some point in their life cycles , they reproduce by way of spores . However , their reproductive habits and vegetative growth are quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells ( fig. 9.1 ) . A few produce mycelium or chains of cells that vaguely resemble mycelium , but a typical laboratory culture is a slimy mass of cells ranging from pale milky to bright red or orange in color . On average , the cells measure 2 to 4 micrometers in diameter ? about five times the size of a bacterium . The nucleus within each cell is difficult to see with a conventional microscope . When yeast cells reproduce asexually , the process is relatively simple . They either bud , or they divide by binary fission . Budding is a process whereby a small part of the wall of the parent spore weakens and enlarges until it has created a second spherical body almost as big as the parent . Then the nucleus divides , a chit inous plate is laid down between the two bodies , other wall materials arc deposited on the membrane , and the daughter 133 // cell is pinched off to grow and bud again . Binary fission , in con trast , occurs when a mother cell grows to almost twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cell wall forms between the nuclei to yield two daughter cells . If yeasts are to reproduce sexually , cells of compatible strains growing in close proximity to one another must be so close that they will grow together . Nuclear fusion follows , then meiosis . For most true yeasts , sexual reproduction is as ascospores borne in membranous sacs . They belong to the Ascomycota , but the sacs are not contained in fruiting bodies . They lie unprotected on the surface of the substrate . A few other yeasts are represen tatives of the Basidiomycota . The fungi reproduce sexually by way of basidiospores borne on the surface of a basidium , and the yeastlike phase is just one stage in the vegetative growth of the fungus . Fungi that have two growth phases , one that is yeastlike and one that is filamentous , are called dimorphic fungi , and their // evolutionary relationship to true yeasts is uncertain . In most books about fungi , especially fungi that cause human diseases , you may see reference to the " yeastlike growth phase " of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly different from true , single-celled yeasts . There are literally hundreds of known species of true yeasts and probably hundreds more yet to be described , but the subjects of most of the rest of this chapter , the culprits in Tamar 's historic moment , are all in one genus , Saccharomyces . Literally translated , the name means " sugar fungus " and these fungi do , indeed , thrive on substrates with high ? but not too high ? concentrations of sugar . What 's more , if Saccharomyces cells are provided with an environment rich in sugar but lacking in oxygen , they do a curious thing . They secrete enzymes that reduce the sugar to two simpler chemicals , carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol . The process is called alcoholic fermentation . BAKING WITH YEAST In making bread , sugar ? often in the form of honey or molasses ? is added to the flour and water mixture to nourish yeast growth . Then the patient baker moves on to other chores while the yeasts work their magic . And what magic it is ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar are trapped within the dough , causing it to take on an apparent life of its own . It " grows " ? rises ? to a size three times that of the original mass , only to be punched down by the baker so it may rise again . Then it is baked in an oven . The carbon dioxide lightens and flavors the bread while the other main product of yeast metabolism , ethyl alcohol , evaporates during kneading and baking . In the thousands of years since its discovery , leavened bread has become a dietary staple for people throughout the world . Floured grain and yeast make a nutritious meal whose flavor can be varied a hundred different ways with different grains and different strains of yeast and other additives. 135 // BREWING WITH YEAST Although carbon dioxide from yeast-mediated fer mentation may be the most important end product for the baker , there are other people in the world who are much more concerned about the other product of the fermentation equa tion . These folks have their eyes on the ethyl alcohol , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield beverages with uniquely desirable qualities . If sugar is fed to Saccharomyces in the form of grape juice , the product of alcoholic fermentation is wine. * If sugar is supplied as partially rotted ? by another fungus ? rice , the product is sake . And if sugar comes from partially germinated barley seeds ? brewmeisters call it " malt " ? the product is beer . Hops added to the latter give it the flavor modern-day beer drinkers have come to identify with the drink , but that addition is a rela tively recent twist to an ancient brew . Wine is almost as old as civilization itself , and the process for making it ? for putting the yeasts to work , if you will ? has changed little since those earliest days . ' To begin , grapes are harvested and the juice is extracted by squeezing , pressing , or stomping . For red wines , the skins are left on during juice ex-traction and the pigment becomes part of the wine . For white wines , the skins are removed . Inevitably , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stems , seeds , and other debris , but these are of little concern to the vintner because these " addi tives " contain chemicals that give many wines their distinctive flavors . Some naturally occurring yeasts ( e.g. , species of Kloeckera , Hanseniospora , etc. ) also find their way into the juice , or " must " // in vintner 's terms , as it is extracted , but they 're welcomed and actually begin the fermentation process as soon as they are immersed . Unfortunately , those wild yeasts ca n't tolerate alcohol concentrations above about 4 percent , a level hardly acceptable to either vintner or customer . For higher alcohol levels and to ensure more predictable flavors , a special wine yeast , Saccharomyces ellipsoideus , is added to the mix . Typically , strains of wine yeasts tolerate alcohol levels of about i 2 percent , and most have been selected after many years of trial and error for the flavors they impart to the wines as well as for their alcohol tolerance . Unfortunately , yeasts are n't the only microbes likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few minute insects are common cohabitants . Bacteria of particular note ? because of their ability to convert ethyl alcohol to acetic acid ? are in the genus Acetobacter . If left unattended , these noxious intruders can quickly turn a prized Chardonnay into marginally palatable vinegar ? an unfortunate turn of events , at best ! To counter the actions of Acetobacter and other possible contaminants , sulfur is added to the must to kill the hitchhikers and preserve the integrity of the wine . Sulfuring , as it is called , is accomplished on an industrial scale by bubbling sulfur dioxide through the brew ; home wine makers do the same thing by adding small amounts of sodium bisulfite in the form of campden tablets . Fortunately , the wine yeast can tolerate slightly higher levels of sulfur than other microbes , and soon after sulfuring is complete , the fermentation begins again . If there is a lot of sugar in the juice or if extra sugar is added , then the fermentation continues only until the level of ethyl alcohol becomes so high that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar remains unconverted and sweet wine is the product . Dry wine is made from juice with less sugar to begin with , and the result is more complete utilization of the available sugars . Any one yeast cell lives only for a few hours , and as the fermentation runs its course , there is constant birth , growth , and 137 // death in the teeming ecosystem of the fermentation vessel . Dead yeast cells ? lees to vintners ? not only cloud the wine but may also mar its flavor and thus must be removed at regular intervals . One way to clarify wine is to carefully pour the mix into new containers , leaving behind the lees that have settled on the bottoms of previous ones . The process is called racking . Negatively charged fining agents , such as charcoal , egg white , or gelatin , may also be added to the wine because they help to speed the settling of positively charged spent cells and other contaminants , thus minimizing the number of necessary rackings . Several environmental factors must be controlled for fermentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is temperature . Not only is there an optimum temperature range for fermentation , but maintaining that temperature is complicated because some fermentation reactions are exothermic ? they give off heat . Thus , the mix must be kept in a place that is cool enough to prevent overheating but not so cool as to slow conversion of the sugar or threaten the vitality of the yeast . Few natural places have the constant temperatures that are most conducive to fermentation . Underground caverns are one of them , and this bit of technology , discovered thousands of years ago , still has its place in the making of fine wines today . Another factor the vintner must monitor closely is acidity . Conditions in the vineyard vary from year to year , and as they do , grapes may yield juice that is either too acidic or too alkaline for optimum fermentation . The juice thus has to be adjusted accordingly . If it is too acidic , the cause is most likely excess tartaric acid ? the natural acid in grape skins . Fortunately , this acid precipitates out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wine will settle the tartaric acid crystals at the bottom of the vat . Coping with wine that is too alkaline can be far more complicated . Records from ancient times indicate that a handful of pigeon dung added to the wine would correct the situation . Thank goodness modern-day commercial wine makers arc sub- // ject to laws that specify very precisely what additives may go into wine , and pigeon dung is not among them . More acceptable forms of acid are now available . When fermentation is complete and the wine has been racked for the last time and bottled and sealed , it is usually still not ready for the table . Continued aging allows a small amount of the alcohol to react with certain organic acids to produce chemicals known as esters . Esters have strong , fruity aromas , even in very low concentrations . If given enough time to form , they 'll add distinctive flavors , especially to red wines . The foregoing discussion shows that many different elements work together to make the wine that eventually ends up on the banquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are derived from six or seven standard varieties of grapes , literally hundreds of other kinds of grapes are grown in backyard vineyards around the world . Each has its own unique flavor . Variations in climate ( rainfall , temperature , length of season ) cause changes in the sugar content of the grapes from year to year and may also determine the composition of the population of native microflora on the grape skins . Strains of yeasts used to produce different wines may also vary from batch to batch and from vintner to vintner . Indeed , some strains are trade secrets guarded with security rivaling that at the doors of Fort Knox . And some wines , not true wines in the strictest definition , are adulterated with added sugar , juices , or even wine from another batch . There is also the unusual situation where a mold as well as a yeast plays an important role in the nature of the final product.2 Legend has it that through most of the eighteenth century , when the great vineyards of Germany were still owned by the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official word from the prince-abbot . In one particular year ? some say 17 16 , others 1775 , and still others i 783 ? it seems that the notoriously absent-minded abbot forgot to send out a messenger with instructions Io begin the harvest . The monks ofJoCHAPTER 9 hannesburg waited , patiently at first , but with increasing concern . Finally , frantic with worry as their grapes ripened and passed their prime , the monks dispatched a messenger of their own to get the needed permission . But this man was detained by highwaymen ? or a pretty woman ? and never returned . A week or so later , a second messenger was sent forth , and he also failed to return . Finally , a third messenger did get through ? and came back with approval to begin the harvest . And so it began , albeit four weeks late . By that time , some of the crop had been attacked by a mold . These grapes were so shriveled that they looked like raisins and were kept separate from the unaffected grapes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the monastery could reach its yearly quota . Much to everyone 's astonishment , the shriveled grapes produced the richest wine with the most unique and pleasing flavor the monks had ever tasted . The reason was that the grapes had been rotted by the common gray mold , Botrytis cinerea ( fig. 9.2 ) . Infection by Botrytis had caused the grapes to lose water , thus increasing their relative sugar concentration . In addition , the mold imparted a unique flavor of its own . Today , grapes in several historic European wine-making districts are purposely held back from harvest until infection by Botrytis has elevated them to a desired level of flavor . Special strains of wine yeast have also been selected to complement the effects of mold . The alcohol content of wines made from these ingredients is slightly higher than conventional wines , and the taste is described as " distinctive " but not moldy . B. cinerea has become known among vintners as the " noble rot " because of its flavorful impact on grapes and wine made from them . Picolit , Gewurztraminer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ botrytized grapes . Chateau d'Yquem , otherwise known as liquid gold , is considered by many to be the best . Sake or rice wine is another drink produced from the combined effects of a mold and a yeast . This popular beverage , originating in the Far East and now drunk throughout the world , // has rice rather than grape juice as its raw material . The starch in rice is completely resistant to degradation by yeast enzymes and must be converted to sugar first . For this job , another com mon mold , Aspergillus oryzae , is put to work . Mold , yeast , and rice are mixed together in one large vat , and as the mold breaks the rice down into simple sugars , they in turn are reduced by the yeast to ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide . In brewing beer , elements of both wine and sake production are employed.3 Barley is the raw material for this universally loved beverage , but as it comes from the field , it , like rice , is com posed largely of starch that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds germinate , the starch in them is natu-141 // rally converted into sugar . Barley seeds are moistened and spread out on the floor of a warm , humid room where they can begin to grow . Within hours , however , the experienced brew meister determines that the conversion has proceeded far enough , the process is stopped by heating , and the partially grown seeds , now known as " malt , " are dried and roasted . To continue brewing , malt is mixed with water and additional sugar , and the mix ? now called " wort " ? is boiled briefly . After it has cooled to about go F , the appropriate yeast is added . Some brewers use strains of Saccharomyces cerevisceae , or baker 's yeast , while others prefer S. carlsbergensis . Both species are closely re lated but are distinctly different from wine yeasts . Brewmeisters typically add another ingredient to the wort : the dried flowers from a vine known as hops . Two kinds of hops are usually used . One is added as the mix is brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hops ? is added just minutes before the heat is turned off . The yeast does nothing to the hops , but hops add a bitter ness that produces the characteristic flavor of beer . After fermentation is allowed to proceed for a few days or per haps a week , the wort is siphoned off to a clean container , al-lowed to ferment a short time more , and filtered . Then it 's bot tled or kegged with a bit more sugar , and the carbon dioxide released during fermentation in the closed container gives beer its carbonation . Commercial brewers pump carbon dioxide di rectly into the kegs to get clear beer with a good head . One commonly cited difference between brewing beer and making wine is that beer brewers are sticklers for cleanliness ? while vintners tolerate some extraneous microbes from grape skins in their must . For some wines , in fact , those extras are welcome because they give the wine its unique flavor . Notable exceptions to the rule of sterility in the beer world // are Iambic ? or " lambeek " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kriek iambic , with crushed cherries added , and frambozen Iambic from raspberries are two typical brews . Lambics use no added ale or lager yeasts . Instead , the wort is fermented in open-air vessels in wooden buildings with what-ever yeasts fall out of the air or ride in on the skins of the fruit . Not surprisingly , the flavor of Iambic beer is far removed from traditional hopped beers , but it is still pleasing to the palate and commands a high price in the market . Efforts to brew iambics in other parts of the world have met with limited success , but the connoisseur still looks to the south of Brussels for the real thing . People who study the evolution of human cultures would be remiss if alcoholic beverages , brewed with the unswerving devotion of millions of yeast cells , were not placed highly on their list of important factors . Archaeologists have determined that from the earliest of times , perhaps as long 25,000 years ago , wine and beer were drunk by people of all social strata and all ages.4 In areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine seemed to be the beverage of choice . Beer was more popular in cooler or drier climates where the culture of cereal grains was common . While there is still some disagreement about which came first ? wine or beer ? there is little doubt that both were very popular . In the Middle East , and perhaps elsewhere , alcoholic beverages served several purposes . Some people drank them in moderation with meals to add flavor and to mellow the moment ; witness Christ 's miraculous transformation of water to wine for a feast at Cana ( John 2:6 ? io ) and the choice of wine to represent his blood at the Last Supper . Others imbibed these intoxicants to excess to dull their senses , and still others drank them beCHAPTER 9 cause they were the only potable liquids available . Water in rivers and oases was often fouled by sewage from the people and animals living nearby , and it was clearly not fit to drink , and milk spoiled quickly in the heat of the day . But few noxious microbes could survive even modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehydrated many a spent soul . By the time of the Pharaohs , mothers concerned about the nutritional value of their children 's school lunch sent them packing each day with a supplemental jug of beer . As civilizations evolved , so did the culture of grapes and grain and the techniques for transforming them into pleasurable food and drink . Efforts of the U.S. government to stem the tide by making intoxicating beverages illegal in 1919 met with such stiff resistance from the public that the edict was rescinded fourteen years later . Today beer brewing and wine making are multibillion-dollar industries . They have been so successful in the United States that the average American consumes about 41 gallons of alcoholic beverages per year : 35 for beer , 3.5 for wine , and 2.5 in distilled spirits . About 50,000 people are employed to sate the nation 's appetite for these drinks , and their products are taxed more heavily than most other businesses , making the industry ? and the yeasts on which they are built ? significant contributors to the U.S. economy . In the mid-i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicating that moderate alcohol consumption might actually benefit human health . The focus of their attention was red wine : it apparently reduced heart disease among the French , who have traditionally had diets with the highest fat content of any culture in the civilized world . Based on fat intake alone , the French should have had high rates of coronary heart disease , but research showed that they did n't . Indeed , they had lower rates than the Americans or the British and were comparable to the rates in China or Japan . ' The cause for the " French paradox , " as it is known , continues to be the subject of debate among members o1 ' the medical community . Additional re- // search has shown that while the French have generally high levels of " good " HDL cholesterol , the levels are not much higher than those of people in countries with more heart disease . What is different , apparently , is that because the French engage in moderate wine consumption throughout their day , they are better able to sustain consistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reduces blood platelet aggregation , and thus the chances for clotting and the blockage of circulatory pathways . Scholars reviewing the older literature for signs of additional medical benefits from alcoholic beverages have not had to look far . Numerous passages in the Bible refer to the healing powers of wine ; Plato is known to have extolled its beneficial effects ? " No thing more excellent nor more valuable than wine was ever granted mankind by God " ? and there is some evidence that Homer used wine to heal wounds . More recently , Louis Pasteur wrote that " wine is the most healthful and most hygienic of beverages . " For all the good that might come from regular , moderate alcohol intake , we know far more about the damage that results from regular , excessive intake . Unfortunately , a certain percentage of the human population simply can not self-regulate its consumption of alcoholic beverages . " For them alcohol has become a sinister crutch they can not cast away . About 1.5 million Americans are currently in alcohol recovery programs . It is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble they are in . Ethyl alcohol claims about ioo , 000 lives annually ; 20,000 of them are people in the nineteen to twenty-four-year age group who die in alcohol-related accidents . The economic cost to U.S. citizens for all the programs related to the prevention and treatment of alcoholism is estimated at $125 billion . One can neither praise the yeasts for the joy they 've brought nor blame them for the misery they 've wrought . All they are trying to do is survive , to perpetuate their own kind . Somewhere along the evolutionary trail , some species acquired the ability to carry out unique chemical reactions , and now humankind must 145 // take responsibility for harnessing them for their own use or abuse , as the case may be . ? A Feast of Yeast ? Dissertations on the roles of yeasts in human affairs almost al-ways gravitate toward the contribution of these fungi to alco holic fermentation . But yeasts are good sources of nutrition in and of themselves.a They are high in B vitamins and protein , and are far more efficient at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , one person has calculated that one acre of land devoted to the production of carbohydrates could yield Boo pounds of protein in the form of yeast but only 70 pounds in the form of meat or milk protein . Numbers like these are of special interest to leaders of Third World countries who are trying to cope with diminishing arable lands and burgeoning populations . The only limitations seem to be that yeasts contain relatively high amounts of nucleic acids , which can be toxic if eaten in excess , and they are low in the amino acids tryptophan and methionine . Genetic engi neering could probably address the latter issue , but if one were to depend solely on yeasts for protein , nucleic acid toxic ity could become a problem . 146 // Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms If you have an interest in collecting and eating fungi from the wild , you 're not alone . Millions of people throughout the world are avid mushroom hunters , and many depend on their collections as important sources of food as well as income . In eastern Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many a weekend will find families spanning three generations or more wending their way through field and forest , baskets in hand and eyes glued to the ground before them . North Americans are generally more reluctant to enjoy foraging for this unique complement to Mother Nature 's fare , for it often means foregoing a round of golf , an afternoon of football watching , or a day at the beach . However , a select few do have the character to make the really tough choices in life , and for these hunters a diverse and delectable array of mush-rooms and other fleshy fungi awaits . Each passing year finds more and more people warming to the idea , and now mush-room hunting clubs can be found in most large cities . In fact , wild mushrooms represent such an important source of income for some residents of the western United States that there is gen uine concern that mushrooms are being overpicked as people flock to the national forests to reap nature 's bounty . ' If you want to join the special world of the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning and pro ceed slowly , with caution . First , you must have the right equipment . A basket or some other rigid container is a necessity ? it is important to be able to preserve the structure of each mushroom that you collect until you 've had a chance to identify it . You definitely do n't want to 147 // risk having specimens squashed at the bottom of a soft bag or in your pocket . If carrying a basket does n't quite suit your selfimage , then a container such as a lunch box , tool box , tackle box , or ammunition box will do nicely . Bring along a notebook and pencil to make notes about the site where you have collected a particular specimen as well as any other pertinent observations you might wish to record . Also have a knife handy for cutting specimens away from wood and for cutting soil-laden stems from familiar mushrooms . And do n't forget a trowel for digging mushrooms from the soil , and paper bags for separating specimens . Each specimen or group of similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by wrapping them loosely in wax paper or by placing them in the paper bags . Do not place mushrooms in plastic bags . Plastic holds too much moisture , hastening the deterioration of fragile specimens and encouraging growth of potentially toxic bacteria on the surfaces of others . If you are unfamiliar with the kinds of mushrooms you might expect to find at a particular site , consult a local expert . Many high school and college biology teachers have a rudimentary knowledge of wild , fleshy fungi , and some larger universities and science museums employ people who study only fungi and know them very well . County Cooperative Extension offices of state agricultural departments can also usually steer you toward other local experts in a particular area . You 'll also need at least one and preferably several books to help you identify the fungi you collect . I like the following : The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms by G. Lincoff ( A. A. Knopf , New York ) ; Mushrooms Demystified by D. Arora ( Ten Speed Press , Berkeley , Calif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller ( E. P. Dutton , New York ) . These books and many others have excellent color photographs and/or line drawings and thorough descriptions of when and where particular species may be found . Most also have dichotomous keys to the various groups of fungi . In order to use these keys , you 'll // probably have to acquaint yourself with some new terms , but fortunately most popular books include diagrams to familiarize you with them . Keep in mind the following while collecting fleshy fungi , especially if you are planning to eat them : 1 . Dig rather than pick . The stems of some of the most deadly mushrooms rest in below-ground cups known as volvas . If a mushroom with a volva is casually plucked from where it is growing , the volva will likely become detached and remain underground , unseen . To find out if there are any underground structures , dig carefully and lift gently . 2 . Look for evidence of spore color on surrounding vegetation , caps of adjacent mushrooms , and caps of the mushrooms themselves . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reference books , one of the first things you 'll need to know is what color the spores are . Sometimes deposits on surrounding vegetation will give you a clue . Otherwise you will need to wait for several hours to get a spore print indoors . 3 . Keep species ( or specimens that look different ) separate . The wax paper or paper bags you brought along are for this purpose . 4 . Do n't eat wild mushrooms raw . No matter how hungry your mushroom hunting trek makes you , do not ? repeat , do not ? eat wild mushrooms raw . Even those listed in your field guide as choice edibles can evoke a toxic reaction if eaten raw . All should be cooked first . 5 . Learn to cope with Latin names . More and more mushroom field guides supplement Latin names with common ones that may have been invented by the author and perhaps are not used in any other book . Conversely , one author may use a common name for one species while another may use the same common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aforementioned equipment , books and advice in hand , what can the intrepid mushroom hunter expect to find ? Described below arc a few of the more common and easily iden-149 // tified edibles along with some vaguely similar , not so edible counterparts . Think of them as " The Good , the Bad , and the Deadly . " MORELS : MORCHELLA ESCULENTA , M. CRASSIPE , S , M. ANGUSTICEPS , AND OTHERS ( PLATE 2A ) About twenty-eight species of morels grow worldwide , but only six grow commonly in North America . They are not typical gilled mushrooms , but rather are related to the cup fungi . A central , hollow stem and convoluted , puckered ? some say brainlike or spongelike ? cap distinguishes morels from just about any other mushroom you might find . Most appear in the spring of the year , between mid-April and mid June in the northern tier of the United States , when oak leaves are the size of mouse ears . Old apple orchards , pine forests , sites with recently dead elms , and recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places where morels are most likely to pop up . In 1994 in Alaska , following an unusual spate of forest fires , morels came up with unprecedented abundance . Collectors reported being able to harvest more than a pound of morels per minute . The market price for a pound of fruit-bodies , which normally ranged between fifteen and thirty dollars , plummeted to one . As a group , morels are probably the most highly sought-after edible mushrooms . Their subtle meaty flavor is a delightful complement to soups , egg dishes , and creamy casseroles . In recent years , nature 's long-kept secrets for growing morels in captivity have been unearthed , and facilities for commercial production of the mushrooms are just beginning to see their first crop . In time , consumers should expect to see the price of these traditionally high-priced delicacies come down . As is the case with many fleshy fungi , morels tend to come up in the same place for anywhere from three to ten years alter the first fruiting . Part of the lure and lore of mushroom hunting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that location goes to the grave with hint or her . One friend of utim was so COn- // cerned that some contender might discover his secret place that he would leave home before dawn and drive several miles in an evasive manner to shake any " tails " before he headed for his collection site . Residents of the state of Michigan have taken morel hunting to new heights by declaring the morel the state mushroom and by hosting morel festivals in several towns . Prizes for the most and biggest specimens are awarded , and merchants with a wide array of mushroom-related goods flock to the scene . So many enthusiasts are drawn to the state from all over North America that morel hunting has mushroomed into an important , albeit short-lived , part of the state 's tourism industry . FALSE MORELS : GYROMITRA SPECIES , HELVELLA SPECIES ( PLATE 2B ) Those who are easily confused by the mushroom world might confuse morel mushrooms with false morels , which are fungi in the genera Gyromitra and Helvetia . False morels are also relatives of the cup fungi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker , saddle-shaped ( some say lobed or everted or convoluted ) caps . They also fruit in the spring in sites where true morels are typically found . However , the various groups of mushrooms are distinctly different and easily separable once a person has had an opportunity to compare the two in the field . Some false morels are reported to be edible , and some people seek them out with the same zeal that others seek true morels . However , there are also enough reports of sickness and death associated with eating false morels to cause the prudent mushroom hunter to approach them with caution . In at least some of the fruiting bodies , monomethyl hydrazine ? the same chemical used by the Armed Forces as a component of rocket fuel ? has been detected . Symptoms of false morel poisoning resemble t lu tse incurred by armament technicians accidentally exposed to , fuel leaks . Despite reports to the contrary , monomethyl 151 // hydrazine is apparently not inactivated by cooking , inasmuch as people killed by the mushroom have always eaten cooked spec imens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bite were poisoned by the fumes produced by a pot of cook ing Gyromitra . My advice is to let those who think their body chemistry can handle false morels do what they will . But the rest of us are better off not risking exposure . ? Immoral Morels ? Sometimes , people who should know better look the other way because of carelessness or greed . A case in point is the gathering of morels for sale on the open market . In 1977 , au thorities were perplexed when four patrons of a New York restaurant became ill after eating meals that included morels . Upon further investigation it was determined that the morels used in these particular dishes were not what the package claimed they were . Specimens of toxic false morels were in cluded in the mix . ' On another occasion , a diner in Detroit ate poisonous early morels , Verpa bohemica , that were acciden tally included with regular Morchella , and he experienced un comfortable symptoms of liver disease until the toxins were cleared . These episodes prompted a close examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mushrooms , im ported in 1988-89 . Of forty-two samples of morels , nine ( that 's a little more than 20 percent ) were contaminated with either early or false morels . Clearly it 's safer to collect and identify one 's own ! MEADOW MUSHROOMS : AGARICUb ' SPECIES ( PLATE 2C ) These are typical gilled mushrooms . They 're common in fields , lawns , and pastures and often emerge in whole or par tial fairy rings . In the northeastern I'iiited Slates , fruiting usu- // ally begins in midsummer and may continue until the first snow-fall in November . The mushrooms emerge from the soil as white " buttons , " each with a fragile membrane connecting the margin of the cap to the stem . As each cap expands , the membrane breaks and drapes around the stout stem as a ring or annulus . The gills are off-white at first , but they turn to various shades of pink , then purple , and then dark purple-brown within seventy-two hours . Sizes of fully expanded caps vary with the species , ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually rang ing from off-white to light brown . The surface of the cap is al-ways dry , never slimy ; some caps have scales . Many species of this genus are edible and have a flavor simi lar to , albeit stronger than , the commercially grown button mushroom that is also a species of Agaricus . The Agaricus that have a history of ( usually ) mild toxicity to humans have some rather distinct features . Several stain yellow when bruised , an-other stains red , and yet another has reddish brown scales on its cap . If one mistakes an edible species of Agaricus for a poisonous one , the consequence is likely to be little more than an upset stomach . The greater danger lies in trying to collect meadow mushrooms while they are still in the button stage and are eas ily mistaken for some highly toxic species in the genus Amanita , described below . These species and several others in the genus Amanita contain toxins that , if eaten in sufficient quantity , will most cer tainly kill the unwitting consumer . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this section several times ? care fully . Then , find the Amanita sections in several mushroom-hunting field guides and read those . Distinguishing these mushrooms correctly from all others could be a life-or-death proposition . Both of these species of mushrooms , as well as almost all oth-153 // ers in the genus Amanita , are characterized as follows : white spores ; gills not attached to the stem ; a ring , or annulus , around the stem near the top ; and a cup , once a membrane surrounding the button stage , at the base . Note : Both the ring and the cup may deteriorate from weather or insect feeding as fruit-bodies age , so examine several specimens . When very young , the mushrooms can be confused with button-stage field mushrooms or young puffballs . However , distinctions among all three should become obvious when a few specimens are slit open lengthwise . Mature specimens of Amanita mushrooms vary greatly in size , with stems from 2 to 6 inches long and caps from 11/2 to 7 inches wide . Colors of caps range from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. phalloides ) to brown ( A. brunnescens ) , and some may be scaly or warty on top while others are smooth . The most toxic of these mushrooms contains a group of polypeptides known collectively as amatoxins . They damage mammalian systems by blocking enzymes associated with replication of RNA , thus inhibiting the formation of new cells . Unfortunately for the hapless victim , normal maturation and death of existing cells continue without being replaced by new ones . Inasmuch as the toxins tend to accumulate in the liver , damage to that organ is most severe , and the effect has been aptly described as the liver digesting itself.2 For a person who has eaten a toxic Amanita , there may be no indication of poisoning for six to eight hours . Then , nausea , vomiting , fever , chills , minor tremors , and other symptoms ensue . These may be bad enough to cause the victim to be hospitalized , but they may also simply be passed off as a temporary case of food poisoning . Often , within twenty-four hours the initial symptom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Real trouble becomes apparent three to six days later with typical symptoms of liver failure . By then , so much internal damage may have occurred that the hapless victim has little chance for recovery . Those who do are often aiciccl by a liver Iransplant , // massive doses of penicillin G ( in Europe only ; the latter is not an approved therapeutic strategy in the United States ) , or de-contamination of the intestinal tract with activated charcoal . People who have ingested so little amatoxin that their system can cope with it and thus recover on their own may experience an inordinately high number of other liver ailments during the course of their lives . Historically , most Amanita poisoning has occurred in Europe , where collecting mushrooms for the table is a popular family pastime . However , recent years have brought a marked increase in the number of reported poisonings from North America . In many cases , the victims have been immigrants from Southeast Asia , especially Laos , who presumably confuse a poisonous Amanita with a similar-looking edible species from their home-land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un derscore the need for consultation with local experts before wild mushrooms in new geographical areas are picked and pre-pared for the table . Several members of the genus Coprinus are considered by many to be edible and choice . These fungi all have one fea ture in common : the caps dissolve themselves as part of the spore dispersal process . Thus , though they are tasty , they must be collected and cooked the same day , preferably within min utes or hours of picking . C. micaceus , the " mica cap , " usually comes up in dense clusters of a hundred or more fruit-bodies , usually around old tree stumps . They are relatively small mushrooms , with light brown , fragile caps rarely exceeding 11/2 inches in diameter . Thus , large numbers of these mushrooms are needed to make a meal or even to add sufficient flavor to some other food . In view of the tendency of dogs to define their territories by urinating on tree 155 // stumps ? the same stumps that may sport a crop of C. micaceusmy family has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gastronomic delights . C. comatus , also known as the shaggy mane , is a prolific fruiter on recently installed or disturbed lawns . It occasionally fruits in recently disturbed forest sites as well . Where one specimen is found , there are often dozens more nearby , but each mushroom stands alone ; they rarely grow in clumps . The caps are so distinct , with their columnar shape and fragile scales , that it is virtually impossible to confuse them with anything else . Young specimens have off-white gills that quickly become pink , then dark purple-brown , and then black . Stems may have a delicate ring about them early on , but that quickly falls away as the mushrooms age . Mature specimens can be up to 8 inches tall , but they are best picked before reaching full size to catch them before autodigestion for spore liberation begins . C. atramentarius is considered by many to be the true inky cap . Like C. micaceus , it usually occurs in clumps around old tree stumps . However , it 's a much larger and more robust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter , stems ' /3 to 1/2 inch diameter and up to 6 inches long ) and has a grayish brown cap . Although this species is listed as edible and choice in virtually all mushroom field guides , people who eat it are advised not to drink alcoholic beverages for at least 24 to 48 hours before and after eating the mushrooms . That 's because C. atramentarius fruit-bodies contain a chemical with a mode of action in mammalian systems similar to Antabuse ? , the drug used to induce nausea and vomiting in alcoholics who are trying to cope with another fungal product . The poisoning caused by C. atramentarius plus alcohol results in such a sudden and violent reaction that many victims end up in a hospital emergency room to ride out their symptoms . If a bottle of beer or glass of wine is part of your daily fare and you 're not of a mind to give them up , best find some other wild mushroom to sate your- appetite . // ( Note : Other inky caps do not evoke this reaction and are safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known how to grow Pleurotus mushrooms under controlled conditions for a long time . However , only in recent years have American consumers become mycologically adventurous enough to try a mushroom with the stem that grows to the side rather than in the middle , as is the case of the oyster mushrooms in the genus Pleurotus . Mind you , not all fleshy fruit-bodies with off-center stems are Pleurotus or edible , Chanterelles are yet another group of wild mushrooms that have found favor not only on dining room tables but also in gourmet restaurants . The fruit-bodies can not be mass produced in a controlled environment , so all specimens you find on grocery store shelves or in restaurants were hand-picked by somebody who knew what to look for and where . The funnel-shaped fruit-bodies are a pale to golden yellow color and always come up from the ground , never from tree stumps or roots . Their most distinguishing feature is that they have gills that look like folded membranes rather than the typical sharp-edged gills of other mushrooms . Spore prints from those gills may take more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale yellow . Novices should use special care in collecting this mushroom from the field the first time , because there are some common poisonous , but not necessarily deadly , look-alikes . Consult with a local expert if you are the least bit unsure of your identification . 157 // but those that are , are quite tasty . In the wild , they grow on the stems of dead trees . Aspen , beech , cottonwood , and tulip poplar are common hosts for P. ostreatus ; P. porrigens grows on conifers . The mushrooms grow in clumps or clusters and have fan-shaped caps that vary from almost pure white to silvery gray to brown . Spores from all species are white . Perhaps the biggest problem with collecting Pleurotus is that the dense clusters of fruit-bodies tend to attract insects and slugs . Thus , if you do choose to collect these , do so soon after they appear . Break the clumps up when you get home to make sure they have no noxious residents , and then cook or dry them shortly thereafter . // HONEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , AND OTHERS FIG. 8.2 ) The last of the gilled mushrooms to be discussed in this chapter are the honey mushrooms ? Armillaria mellea and its relatives . For many years , mycologists and plant pathologists grouped a large variety of vaguely similar mushrooms under the name Armillaria mellea . Recently , however , through careful genetic analysis , it has become clear that what was once considered one species is now as many as twelve or more . All have some features in common , but they also have significant differences . From the standpoint of the mushroom hunter , distinction between the various species may be a moot point because all are apparently edible , though some have caused mild indigestion in some people . Honey mushrooms fruit in clusters of various sizes on tree stumps and at the bases of dead and living coniferous and hardwood trees . The mushrooms vary in size , with stems 2 to 6 inches long and caps 1 to 6 inches in diameter . The caps are brown and sometimes scaly or smooth . The gills are off-white to light brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cap and stem are not readily separated . Spore prints are white and can often be found on caps of neighboring mushrooms in a cluster . Stems usually have some vestiges of a ring . BOLETES : Boi , FTU.S SPECIES , SUILLUS SPECIES , AND OTHERS FIG. 1O.2A , B ) A final group of stalked mushrooms to be considered here is known as the Boletes because at one time all members of the group belonged to the genus Boletus . However , with revisions in taxonomy , the genus has been split into several additional genera , including Boletellus , Gyroporous , Leccinum , and Suillus . All are characterized by producing a mushroom on a 159
