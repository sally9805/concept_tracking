<p> It started out as nothing more than a token gesture of goodwill in 1892 by Canada 's governor general , Frederick Arthur , Lord Stanley of Preston . <p> Impressed with his country 's spirit about a new game called ice hockey , Lord Stanley decided to give the numerous amateur teams playing the sport something to really play for . <p> For just a 10-pound note , Lord Stanley bought what looked like a silver punch bowl , which he directed to be given annually to the top amateur team in Canada . <p> But what started out as a trinket that teams not much higher than beer-league status vied for has turned into the most glamorous of all big-league trophies . <p> Any professional hockey player would give their last good tooth to sip champagne from the Stanley Cup . <p> Denver Grizzlies coach Butch Goring ought to know . Four times in his playing career , Goring sipped the glorious nectar , courtesy of Lord Stanley . <p> Like the song says , do n't give up until you drink from the silver cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks back to what it was like . <p> " I remember thinking , ' Finally , I get to take part in tradition , " ' said Goring , who won Stanley Cups from 1980-83 with the New York Islanders . <p> " For us Canadians , we grow up seeing the Stanley Cup on TV all the time . It 's such a revered thing in Canada . There 's nothing better for a hockey player than to win one of those . <p> " It 's hard to compare the Stanley Cup to other trophies , but I really think it 's the most unique one of all . There 's just something about the look of it . " <p> But Lord Stanley never intended for players like Goring to drink champagne from it . The Cup was supposed to be an amateur trophy only , but competition for the prize was so intense that amateur team owners gradually started paying players under the table . <p> This year , the winning team of the Stanley Cup finals - which are scheduled to begin later this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , the cost to inscribe the names of each player on the Cup costs five times as much as what Lord Stanley originally shelled out for it . <p> Things have indeed changed from the early days of the sport . <p> Some forms of hockey date back to 500 B.C. , when the Greeks played a kind of field hockey with sticks that looked like long candy canes . <p> The Mohawk Indians played a derivation of the game and some historians credit them for inventing the name of the sport . <p> The Mohawks used the word " ho-ghee " , which translates to " it hurts " , for the sport . Losers of " ho-ghee " games were hit on the head after games . <p> But the French also take credit , saying their word " hoquet " - a bent stick used by shepherds - is where hockey started . <p> Regardless , it was n't until the 1870s that hockey started to be taken seriously as a sport . <p> In December of 1879 , students at McGill University in Montreal played the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had 30 skaters on each team , a kind of controlled madness on the ice . The ice , by the way , was all-natural - not like today 's man-made sheets - and big craters and soft spots meant many a leg injury for the participants . <p> The players were separated only by a wooden post from spectators , and those who fell in disfavor with fans would often be pelted with potatoes or other projectiles . <p> And , unlike today 's hockey players , there was n't much padding under the first players ' uniforms to soften the blow of those projectiles . <p> Magazines were used under sweaters as shoulder pads . <p> Goalies wore no masks , but did use catchers ' chest protectors . <p> The " puck " was often nothing more than a tin can , and the sticks were sometimes just tree branches . <p> But it seemed everyone wanted to play the primitive sport by the 1880s in Canada . <p> In 1885 , the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada was formed in Montreal . The league had only four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kingstons and the Athletics . <p> Players were reduced to seven on a side , and for the first time , games were played indoors . <p> Lighting was bad , however , as oil lamps created shadows and , at times , nobody could see the puck . <p> Instead of just a couple of poles , however , at least goals finally had nets . <p> A man saw some fishermen fixing their nets one day and took some with him to create a new goal . <p> New amateur leagues started forming , but the AHA stayed strongest until 1899 , when the Canadian Amateur Hockey League formed . Many of the players were hardly amateurs , however , as they were paid under the table . <p> The first professional hockey team was actually an American one . <p> In 1903 , a Houghton , Mich. , dentist named J.L. Gibson formed a team called the Portage Lakes . <p> Gibson imported some of Canada 's best amateurs and took the team on barnstorming tours throughout North America . The Lakes went 24-2 in their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team in Sault St. Marie , Ontario , finally declared itself professional in Canada in an effort to keep up with Gibson 's team . <p> In 1908 , the Ontario Professional Hockey League was formed , as was the International Ice Hockey Federation . <p> Several other leagues formed in the next few years , including the National Hockey Association and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association . <p> In 1917 , Seattle of the PCHA defeated Montreal of the NHA for the Stanley Cup , marking the first time the Cup had rested on American soil . <p> If Lord Stanley turned over in his grave about that , he has done so many times since . <p> The NHL is formed <p> On Nov. 26 , 1917 , the National Hockey League was created , mostly because the NHA owners wanted to be free of nettlesome Toronto owner Eddie Livingstone . <p> The only way to do that was to form another league and create a new charter . <p> The owners of Toronto 's hockey arena bought out the often unscrupulous Livingstone , who later tried to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with two Montreal teams ( the Canadiens and the Wanderers ) and Ottawa formed the original NHL . <p> Crowds were good for the first years of the NHL , but there were n't enough dates and not enough teams for Canadian owners to make a profit . <p> The NHL needed to expand , and it looked toward America to do it . <p> In 1924 , the Boston Bruins were added to the NHL , and the next year , the New York Americans and Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets were included . <p> In 1926 , the NHL really started to flourish when the New York Rangers , Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Red Wings were added to the league . It would be another 40 years before any serious changes took place . <p> The Stanley Cup was now the sole property of the NHL , and it was no longer to be competed for by amateur players . <p> Gordie Howe of Detroit was the pre-eminent player of the NHL 's middle years , but the game had many other legends such as Maurice " Rocket " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1960s and 1970s , players such as Bobby Orr , Phil Esposito , Bobby Hull , Guy Lafleur , Mike Bossy and Stan Mikita became legends of the game . <p> Wayne Gretzky - the NHL 's all-time leading scorer - has dominated the game since he came on the NHL scene in 1979 . <p> But players today such as Sergei Fedorov , Eric Lindros and Pat LaFontaine keep adding excitement to the league . <p> The NHL today has 26 teams and plans to add another two by the 1997-98 season , at the latest . <p> Whereas the first hockey players were paid with cash sometimes slipped in their skates before a game , today 's NHL players make an average of $ 600,000 a year . <p> And it 's not just the NHL where players can make a living playing hockey . <p> The International Hockey League is a thriving , 20-team league that often plays to sold-out crowds in large arenas , and the American Hockey League also is doing well . <p> COMSAT Video Enterprises recently bought the Quebec Nordiques and will move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record $ 75 million for the team . <p> Some think it 's only a matter of time before the NHL gets a major television contract and draws even bigger numbers than football or basketball . <p> If only Lord Stanley could see things now .
