Section : professional page <p> It probably does n't occur to many art collectors to purposefully alter , mutilate , or destroy a work of art that they have purchased , but it has happened . Back in 1980 , the Bank of Tokyo outraged the art world when it removed a 1,600-pound , aluminum , diamond-shaped sculpture by Isamu Noguchi that hung in the bank 's New York City headquarters by cutting it into pieces . Two decades earlier , sculptor David Smith condemned a purchaser of one of his painted metal sculptures for " willful vandalism " for removing its industrial green paint . <p> Other notable instances of tampering with artworks have included cases involving the creations of Alexander Calder and Arshile Gorky . Several years ago , a painting by Pablo Picasso was cut into numerous one-inch-square pieces to be sold through magazine advertisements as " original " Picasso works of art by a couple of entrepreneurs in Australia . One of those Australians commented at the time , " If this works , we 're going to put the chop to a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 , passed in the waning hours of the one-hundred-and-first Congress , such tamperings may be less likely to happen in the future . This new law , sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy ( Democrat , Massachusetts ) in the Senate and by Representatives Bob Kastenmeier ( Democrat , Wisconsin ) and Ed Markey ( Democrat , Wisconsin ) in the House of Representatives , is an amendment to the federal copyright law . It provides visual artists with what are called moral rights : the right to attribution  --  that is , to claim " authorship " of their work and challenge false attribution  --  and the right to prevent the total distortion or modification of their creations . <p> In fact , mutilation or destruction of an artist 's work would be considered an infringement on the artist 's copyright , allowing the artist to sue for both compensatory ( out-of-pocket ) and statutory ( up to $10,000 ) damages as well as for actual damages . Those actual damages refer to harm caused to artist 's professional reputations by the distorted appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Visual Artists Rights Act has been hailed as an important new tool for artists , similar legislation already exists on the state level in ten states  --  California , Connecticut , Louisiana , Maine , Massachusetts , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , Pennsylvania , and Rhode Island  --  as well as in Montana and Utah for their state Percent-for-Art statutes . The Visual Artists Rights Act , first introduced into Congress six years ago by Senator Kennedy in a less vigorous form , does not wholly preempt these other state laws , some of which , in fact , are stronger than the federal legislation ; rather , it extends these protections to artists elsewhere in the country . <p> The Visual Artists Rights Act was written quite narrowly , applying only to painters and sculptors as well as to printmakers and fine-art photographers who produce limited editions of two hundred or fewer . Earlier versions of the legislation were opposed by the motion-picture industry , which was concerned that colonization of old black-and-white films could be the basis of a lawsuit . <p> Criminal penalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commercial exploitation such as bootleg films , records , or unauthorized copies of books , were specifically excluded from the Visual Artist Rights Act . The reason for this is that the damage or destruction of artwork is seen as an area for civil , not criminal , litigation . An artist must hire an attorney to bring action against someone damaging or destroying his or her creation . <p> There have been very few lawsuits filed under any of the state laws and , according to John Podesta , the attorney for National Artists Equity Association , " the examples of damage and destruction of artwork we are aware of are not large in number , but they are of such importance to the arts community that there have been a lot of calls for protecting artists ' work . " Those living in one of the ten states with art-protection laws may choose to file a suit under those statutes rather than under the federal law since , as noted above , the federal law does not preempt the state laws . <p> The federal law has affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced from the life of the artist plus fifty years to the life of the artist , making it similar to current laws covering invasion of privacy , libel , slander , and defamation of character . Artists should keep in mind that five of the ten states with art-protection laws  --  California , Connecticut , Massachusetts , New Mexico , and Pennsylvania  --  extend the rights of the creator to the fifty years beyond the life of the artist . <p> It 's important to also note that all of the ten states that have laws protecting artwork include works that have already been sold , whereas the new federal law only considers artwork that is sold after the new legislation has been in effect for six months , or after early May 1991 . <p> One aspect of the federal law of particular interest to muralists and wall sculptors concerns artwork that is attached to a building , for there are now special rules that balance the rights of artists and property owners .
