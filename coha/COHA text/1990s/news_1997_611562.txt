<p> " In all the history of the world , we are the first great nation to feed and support the conquered . " <p> President Harry S. Truman , April 1948 <p> With practiced ease , a worker slices open the cardboard box , pulls out the hand-size panels of California cedar and stacks them at the head of the assembly line . <p> In just a few minutes , the thin blocks make their way down what is known in the factory as Pencil Street , where they are swiftly grooved , inlaid with graphite cores , covered , cut and shaped into some of the 1.2 million pencils that roll out of Faber-Castell 's factory here each year . The California cedar is the key ; no other wood does so well for quality pencils . <p> Ludwig Lihl , 76 , a retiree who first came to work at Faber-Castell GmbH &; Co. in 1950 , knows why this company was able to begin importing cedar from Stockton , Calif. , after World War II . <p> " It would not have been possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When President Clinton and the leaders of three dozen European nations gather Wednesday in the Netherlands to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Marshall Plan , they will hail an extraordinary act of generosity by the United States . Winston Churchill once called it " the most unsordid act in history . " <p> From 1948 to 1951 , the United States gave $ 13 billion worth of money , goods and services to the war-devastated nations of Western Europe . That amount is equivalent to at least $ 88 billion today . For more than three years , Americans , who wanted nothing more than to throw away their ration cards , buy consumables and enjoy the peace , instead turned over as much as 3 percent of what they produced to Europe . <p> Ships filled with crates of food and sacks of grain pulled into Rotterdam , Bordeaux and other ports along Europe 's Atlantic coast . Tractors , fertilizer , turbines , lathes and other equipment quickly followed . European executives and workers traveled across the Atlantic to learn the ways of American business . Loans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and currencies were supported . <p> For Americans who were alive then , the Marshall Plan is a warm but fading memory of a time when the United States  --  inspired in part by a large injection of anti-communism  --  meant more than an unwelcome Yankee . But here in Europe , the legacy of the Marshall Plan is visible for all to see : in high-tech railways and highways , in prosperous , modern cities , in products from perfume to fighter jets . Four of the seven richest nations on Earth are European recipients of Marshall Plan assistance . <p> In addition to stimulating the creation of wealth , Secretary of State George C. Marshall and the group of American advisers who crafted the Marshall Plan helped implant a vision of a Europe whose nations traded freely with each other in peace , whose currencies were fully exchangeable , that ceded sovereignty to joint institutions for the sake of greater prosperity . All of those elements are embodied in what is now the 15-member European Union . <p> " The United States ought not to forget that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It would never have happened without the Marshall Plan , " former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt wrote in the current issue of Foreign Affairs magazine . <p> But the legacy of the Marshall Plan also is visible in what Europe is not . The economic rise of this continent in the 1950s and 1960s , jump-started by Marshall aid , was built on smokestack industries and infrastructure . It was built on products , not processes . It did not prepare Europe to move beyond pencils to personal computers . <p> So today , 50 years after Marshall said of Europe that " the patient is sinking while the doctors deliberate , " Europe is again facing economic crisis . The wealth it has created has left its companies saddled with high costs and bound by inflexibility , many believe . Generous social protections have eased the lives of many but have become too expensive . Business innovation is lacking . And the notion of the free market , with little government involvement , still frightens many here . <p> " We are in the process of liberalizing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to 200 years before the French Revolution , " said Rostislaw Donn , who supervised educational visits by French management and labor to American factories under the auspices of the Marshall Plan in the 1950s . <p> Or , as Imanuel Wexler , economics professor emeritus at the University of Connecticut , put it : " The economic success Western European countries achieved as a result of the Marshall Plan created a situation where governments overextended themselves in terms of social benefits , welfare , unemployment programs that may have overtaxed their resources . . . . The populations of European countries have become accustomed to a great deal of social benefits . " <p> The nightmare seems far away now , but when Americans began examining European living conditions in postwar 1945 , they found devastation . The coal mines that heated the homes and powered the factories of Europe were in disrepair , producing little . Some 5,000 bridges were destroyed . Lacking the reserves to exchange currencies , the nations of Europe could not even trade with one another . <p> Cities in Ruins <p> Whole cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farmers grew food only for their families . American soldiers occupying Germany often found , when they went to discard their uneaten rations , a German begging for the scraps . <p> Schmidt wrote : " There were days during the winter of 1946-1947 when we stayed in bed because there was nothing to eat and nothing to burn for warmth . " Before that terrible winter , the Germans dug thousands of graves for the number of people they knew would starve to death before the earth had thawed . <p> All basic products were rationed . The daily ration of bread  --  a dietary staple  --  in France was 200 grams a day , less than a long baguette loaf . To buy a coat in Germany , you had to request a permit ; it was often denied . A pack of Chesterfield cigarettes cost 100 marks on the black market , a third of one month 's average wage . <p> Vernon Walters , later ambassador to Germany and now honorary chairman of the George C. Marshall International Center in Leesburg , came to Paris in 1948 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Marshall Plan . Even by then , only every other street light was lit , and there were virtually no automobiles in the streets . <p> " The business sector did n't exist pretty much everywhere . Very little was left of the prewar structure , " Walters said . <p> Marshall , a former general , and the great minds that worked for and with him  --  Dean Acheson , George Kennan , Charles Bohlen , William Clayton  --  were deeply disturbed by the reports of devastation and began talking soon after the war of a massive aid program . During the spring of 1947 , with Truman 's acquiescence , they began drafting a plan . <p> There was more than altruism in their work . In February 1946 , Kennan , the charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow , sent his famous " Long Telegram " assessing the Soviets under Joseph Stalin as obsessed with expansion wherever there was a power void . A year later , the United States stepped in to send massive aid to Greece and Turkey , both perceived for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained it to Congress in what became known as the Truman Doctrine , " It must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures . " <p> The legislatures of both France and Italy included substantial numbers of Communists , and unions in both countries were under the sway of Stalin . In the minds of Marshall 's advisers , there was little doubt that Western Europe was under Communist threat . <p> On June 5 , 1947 , Marshall spoke at Harvard University 's commencement . There was little memorable about his words , and it took U.S. newspapers several days to grasp their import . But it was this speech that laid out the goals of what became the Marshall Plan . Europe needed " substantial additional help , " Marshall said , or it faced " economic , social and political deterioration of a very grave character . " <p> Marshall said something else important : " The initiative , I think , must come from Europe . " He was inviting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but , crucially , a joint shopping list . Europe , in other words , would get nothing unless its nations sat down together and proposed a cooperative plan . <p> Even occupied Germany was to be included . The French had been in favor of a more repressive approach . Americans , mindful of how Nazi leader Adolf Hitler used resentment of Germany 's treatment after World War I to win power , believed otherwise . Jacques Delors , former president of the European Union 's chief administrative body , describes the inclusion of Germany as one of the " masterpieces " of the Marshall Plan . <p> British Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin reacted quickly to Marshall 's speech , saying later that it " seemed to bring hope where there was none . . . . We grabbed the lifeline with both hands . " Within days Marshall was on a plane to Paris . On July 12 , 1947 , 16 nations began meeting in the Grand Dining Room of the French Foreign Ministry , as the Committee for European Economic Cooperation . <p> The Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow Poland or Czechoslovakia to participate , thereby unintentionally assuaging the most potent U.S. congressional objections to the plan . By November , a package of interim emergency aid was approved . The Soviet clampdown on Czechoslovakia in February 1948 gave Congress the final impetus . On April 3 , Truman signed the Economic Cooperation Act implementing the Marshall Plan . <p> Industries Reborn <p> The relief efforts probably were the most visible for the average European . For Charles Pasqua , now a former interior minister of France , the Marshall Plan meant one thing : " white bread . " Others describe the end of ration cards , or the return of eggs and butter to the stores , or their first new winter coat . Those who were children in Germany remember eating canned American soup ; British infants drank American orange juice . Homemakers in Greece were given baby chicks . <p> But the longer-lasting effect of the Marshall Plan was on industry . Nearly all the great names of European business  --  Renault , Pechiney and Dassault in France ; Volkswagen and Daimler-Benz in Germany ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  were started or restarted with American assistance after the war . <p> Countless small businesses , merchants and farmers were put back on their feet . Ski lifts were restored in Austria . In a documentary on the Marshall Plan produced by Linda and Eric Christenson that will air on PBS June 6 , Rotterdam resident Ivo Blom explains simply how the famous port was rebuilt : " When the Marshall aid came in , that 's how we could buy new cranes . " <p> Faber-Castell , unlike many German factories , was not in ruins at the end of the war . The plant in Stein had been converted to producing munitions , but the basic machinery to make pencils was still there . The company , in business in this small suburb of Nuremberg since 1761 , also was still family-owned . <p> But there was no currency to support production of pencils , or anything else . The Nazi currency , the reichsmark , was losing more value by the day . It was replaced at a 10-to-1 ratio by the deutsche mark , backed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar allowed Faber-Castell to buy the American cedar and bring it in for pencil casings . <p> In addition , the Marshall Plan created a mechanism that allowed each European nation to exchange its currency freely with all the others  --  a commonplace occurrence now  --  to replace the damaged system of bilateral exchange controls that had prevailed before the war . The European Payments Union , as it was called , was bolstered by $ 600 million in American support , and it was another way Americans helped Europeans to cooperate with each other . <p> So Faber-Castell pencils , encased in California cedar , were soon on their way to Spain , Sweden and Greece , to Iran and Saudi Arabia , to Latin America . They were trucked to the newly rebuilt ports on rebuilt roads , often courtesy of the Marshall Plan . Even the factory that makes the machines that make the pencils was rehabilitated in part through Marshall Plan money , factory retiree Ludwig Lihl said . <p> In the four years of the Marshall Plan , from 1948 to 1951 , industrial production in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have happened without American aid , which accounted for a fraction of total European investment . But scholars say it would not have happened so fast , or been shaped the way it was . <p> The shape was determined in part by a massive injection of American management and technological know-how . Although the labor force in most European countries was well trained and educated , two world wars had left production capabilities where they had been in 1910 . In addition to furnishing factories with machines , the Marshall Plan sent delegations of thousands of European business people and labor union representatives to myriad companies in the United States to learn the American ways of modernization , management and productivity . <p> " The goal was to modify the psyche of people , " said Donn , who supervised some of the French teams . " So many of them thought American productivity was due to things like natural resources , or your large population . " <p> But was the psyche of Europe modified ? The roots of the welfare state run deep on this continent , predating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are called the " 30 glorious years " in France  --  Europe created enough wealth to afford an ever-expanding pool of benefits , protections and regulations . Somewhere along the line , say those with long memories , the mentality changed . <p> " After the war , people went to church and thanked God for the opportunity to work , " said a German official who asked not to be named . " Today , the attitude is to work as little as possible . " <p> Those benefits make employees costly , reducing hiring . Unemployment rates for the 16 Marshall Plan countries range from less than 8 percent in Britain to more than 20 percent in Spain . Half of those countries have unemployment in the double digits , while U.S. unemployment is less than 5 percent . Of the 10 most competitive countries in the world , according to the World Economic Forum , only two , Britain and Norway , are graduates of the Marshall Plan . <p> The evolution of Faber-Castell symbolizes the direction Europe has taken since the uplift following the Marshall Plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from 1,500 10 years ago . The assembly line is mostly machines , run by relatively few workers . Its production is dwarfed by the number of pencils and other implements produced in Faber-Castell factories in Brazil , Malaysia and Indonesia . The Brazil factory alone has 2,800 employees and produces more than 1 billion pencils a year . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : May 27 , 1997 June 6 , 1997 <p> CORRECTION : An article Sunday about the Marshall Plan omitted one of the co-producers of a June 6 PBS documentary on the plan . It is the Educational Film Center . <p> Articles on May 25 and May 29 quoted former British prime minister Winston Churchill describing the Marshall Plan as " the most unsordid act " in history . His words actually referred to the Lend-Lease Act of 1941.
