Late night comedy : On the day Jay Leno has been announced as host of NBC 's The Tonight Show beginning next May , Johnny Carson confides to his audience , " I want to tell young Jay Leno I 've changed my mind ; I 'm gon na stay . " And then Carson , the program 's star since Jack Kennedy was President , barks out his brittle laugh and purports to lose himself in merriment . <P> Late night melodrama : An hour or so later , David Letterman says , " Before we continue , I think we should congratulate our friend Jay Leno for being selected as the host of The Tonight Show . And the good news for us is , we get Stump the Band . " This hoariest of Carson time fillers is no silver medal for Letterman , in his 10th year as star of his own NBC chatfest . The world had long known that the anvil-jawed Leno , Tonight 's exclusive guest host since 1987 , was bound to succeed Carson . But press tattle hinted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was furious at not being offered the job . One source told the Washington Post that Letterman planned to sue NBC to break his contract , making him available for offers from CBS and ABC . Once upon a time , the ringmaster of Stupid Pet Tricks was indeed Carson 's heir apparent , Bonnie Prince Dave . But now Leno will assume command over the United Kingdom of Late Night . Letterman gets to keep Wales . <P> For NBC the decision was nothing but common sense . The cash-register-drawer- j awed new host not only projects a likable , intimate video presence , but he will also bring in more money for Tonight : his audience tends to be younger than Carson 's , thus more appealing to advertisers . He is also a plow horse of stand-up comedy . Currently he does concerts in three or four cities a week in addition to his subbing duties . For The Tonight Show Starring Jay Leno , he will appear in 250 new episodes a year , more than twice the number Carson now does . And no slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a Leno . <P> Leno sees his anointing as a reward to be judiciously savored . " I consider myself a good soldier , " he says . " You go to work , you do the job  --  write joke , tell joke , get check  --  and the world will pretty much take care of itself . " After establishing himself as a Johnny wannabe , the glockenspiel- jawed comic was offered other talk-show slots , but , he says , " I wisely turned them down . To me , this is the only job in television . I 'm kind of coming in as the new CEO . You do n't really own it , you just hold it and try not to drop the ball when you hand it to the next guy . I like the history of The Tonight Show , being able to look back over the years and think , gee ! Steve Allen ! Jack Paar ! Johnny Carson ! You get to hang your picture on the same wall . " <P> Allen built the wall in 1954 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snappy conversation . For five years beginning in 1957 , Paar turned it into a wailing wall ; he made Tonight into Event TV by tangling with politicians and crackpots , discussing his young daughter 's training bra , walking off the show one night after the censors clipped a joke . And Carson , unquestionably the longest lived power player in TV , bought the wall . Or rather , as his popularity and contract demands escalated , NBC bought it for him .
