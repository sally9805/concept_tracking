In memory of Matt Clark , z966-rgf <p> I. <p> Hooper peers out of his cage , past the wrecked carpet slide and the wormy carousel , past the funnel-cake booth and the dry-docked swash boats . The park is dark and still but for the faint grumble of traffic beyond the live oaks at the gate . Another weird Friday night , in a lengthening string of them . But this marks-this must mark-a new low : here he is , hunkered among piles of monkey scat in a cramped pen , a prisoner in Turvyland . He 's scanning those oak leaves ( well , where else to turn ? ) in search of nothing less than a savior . Do n't sneer : when the tough find themselves trapped after hours in seedy amusement parks . . . well , like anyone else , the tough start flailing for straws . <p> Hooper ca n't be sure he 's seeing the oaks ' leaves , exactly-better to say he 's staring into that billowy intensity of darkness that he figures for foliage . This two-bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lit . The others have had their eyes put out by vandals . Even the working fixtures cast only a shy , sickly circle of blue ; they whine in tune with the mosquitoes . Since childhood Hooper 's favorite refuge in times of boredom has been reading , but the only available material tonight turns out to be homemade signs that must be the work of the park 's owner , That Asshole Breaux . Cartoonish drawings on plyboard tout the traditional midway foodstuffs ; placards above the restrooms read , mysteriously , " Pointers " and " Setters " ( oh , now he gets it ) ; and so on . Hooper can make out two hand-lettered warnings in his corner of Turvyland , the pitifully dirty mini-menagerie : DO NOT FEED THE ALBINO OTTER FUNYUNS THIS MEANS YOU and , along the slack barbed wire of the goats ' pen , STAY BACK UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOOSE A FINGER . THE MGMT . If he ever gets out of this mess , Hooper may use that last sign in freshman comp on Monday as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not clear whether one 's finger will be taken by the animal or , per Cajun-Islamic justice , by the MGMT . <p> So here I am , thinks Hooper . Home again , home again , jiggety jig . This is n't funny , does n't sound even vaguely funny . He 's behind bars in a chimp 's box , parsing the scrawls of That Asshole Breaux . His manacled wrist hurts ; the balls of his feet have gone rubbery ; he has to pee . There are nasty mounds of turd all around his Italian loafers . And that 's just the tip of the iceberg , the turd-berg . Tonight , his whole life is going to shit . <p> Hooper likes to think of himself as hyperarticulate ; he is , after all , in his **46;670;TOOLONG way , an English professor . Now he summons up the word scumber , which he 's pretty sure means " dung . " It may apply only to dogs and foxes , but who 's here to call him down ? Who 'd rob a schmuck handcuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baton Rouge summer night . . . who 'd deny him the pleasure of a recherche word to roll around his mouth while he waits for the cops to come and his life to start unraveling in earnest ? Right , right . So Hooper , thank you very much , squats amid the scumber . Around him pullulates juh-huh ) the pestiferous ( yes ! ) world . <p> Being in a cage sucks . Hooper knows that 's not a profound insight  --  hell , it 's more or less the thought that brought him out here in the first place , in a halfwit attempt to save Taffy the Chimp-but it 's a conviction he can hold , now , with new depth of feeling , with the credibility that comes with having been there , done that : Folks , let me tell you , being in a cage sucks ! Some people , Hooper reflects , are n't cut out for social justice ; they should do whatever it takes to choke back the urge . Next time he feels called to mount a spur-of-the-moment solo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chase off ( or at least numb ) his foolish sympathies by smoking some bud and listening to Billie Holiday . <p> Hooper 's parents are on the way into town from Fayetteville , Arkansas , and his house desperately needs defagging . Six months ago , after years of doubt and then months of creeping realization , he finally made the big lifestyle change , and he has n't found ( oh , shut up ! ) the right way to break the news yet . Every time Hooper talks to his dad , the old man makes a to-do of shooing the Mrs. and then whispers conspiratorially , " You been dippin ' the wick , son ? Life ai n't all litty-ture , you know . " How do you tell a rough-and-tumble ex  --  sheriff like that , a muskhound whose truckbed toolbox , all through your boyhood , harbored porn mags called EEEE-normous and Mountain Do ! - you 're his only son , he 's your only father , and with your frail build and crisp pleats and fragile sensibility and your goddamn book in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest in bow-hunting or cracking lawbreakers ' skulls or college football you 've already departed from him in virtually every way  --  how do you tell this man ( be it noted that he 's the man , too , who 's retiring your graduate-school loans and buying you a new car and still sending you , at thirty , a healthy allowances . . . how do you tell your dad , who thinks the only thing you have left in common is a mutual appreciation for the feminine chassis , that you 're horny for boys now , sorry to disappoint but there it is ? <p> Anyway , it 's nine now , and they 'll be here by ten . Hooper 's mom has a key to his place , and he does n't want them wandering in to find the shrine to Antonio Banderas , the " Looking for the Perfect Elf " votive candle , the inevitable musical-theater playbills . And the bedroom-he ca n't even begin to think about the bedroom . Hooper 's parents are old-fashioned ; his mother collects Hummels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's gay , had to know it already twenty years ago , when he ditched the motocross bike his father had just given him and slunk in the house to help sift through earrings for something to match her blue moue dress-though she certainly never bothered to tell Hooper ( which might have saved him a lot of time and trouble ) . If he made an announcement now she 'd be supportive , in her baffled way ; but Hooper can easily imagine what will happen if , unwarned , she enters the bedroom . His mother has always had trouble when confronted with explicitness of any kind ( hence the hiding place for Papa 's porn ) , and Hooper 's own assortment of finials and figurines will stop her heart in a hurry . <p> The upshot of all this is that Hooper 's parents , finding his house deserted , will wonder what 's happened to their boy and will investigate ; they 'll find plenty . When he comes home from jail , disheveled and exhausted , his fingertips black from booking , wrists raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not going to aid his argument that he 's perfectly normal , the same son they 've always known . He knows his father will boil the story down , as usual , to a lurid headline : HOMO IDJIT MAROONED ALL NIGHT IN CHIMP CAGE-NO GODDAMN SON OF MINE . Hooper 's mother will get out the peroxide and bathe his wrists and weep soundlessly . Finally , she 'll dredge up from unseen depths of feeling a few practical words : " Martin , " she 'll say , the tears watering her cheeks , " do n't you keep mercurochrome in your medicine chest ? You know you should . " <p> The night has not begun well . Being in a cage sucks . 2 . <p> Hooper has a sister , Lenore , who 's eight years his senior and a minion of Lucifer . There 's ample evidence of this ; even as a child , Lenore bore enough Marks of the Beast to cover a whole squad of antichrists . Besides her spite and meanness ( and you would n't need more substantiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugliness . Lenore at sixteen : her hair was outlandishly big and butter  --  yellow , her nostrils flared so big that you could n't plug one with a thumb , and she was more or less unequipped with eyebrows , which was an obvious sign that nobody but Hooper appeared able to read ... this despite the fact ( pay attention , people ! ) that she penciled them in as Mephistophelean curlicues , which she used to fence in her hellfire  --  orange ( clue ! ) eyeshadow . Thanks to Lenore , Hooper 's vision of Beelzebub is a cross between Dionne Warwick and Cyndi Lauper . Instead of a pitchfork Lenore wielded an aluminum file , with which she sawed at herself nonstop . The rapid-fire rasp of metal on fingernail followed her everywhere , a skin-crawling soundtrack ; this was the sound of sinners being peeled . Hooper cringed and pled for it to stop . <p> Still and all , the yokels of northwest Arkansas-as a kid , already , Hooper knew that though he found himself among them , he was not of them-had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him until he realized that it was Satan 's bounden duty to deceive mankind . It was beyond him what the Prince of Darkness would want with the homecoming tiara from Hindsville High , but the ways of the PoD are subtle ... and Hooper reasoned that a reject from heaven might well yearn for crowns , even chintzy ones that seemed to be made of plastic cutlery . <p> But the proof was the monkey , the devil 's animal familiar . When he was eight , Lenore got a pet capuchin monkey , a castoff from a small circus that was , Hooper thought he heard , " going to funk . " ( He was a college sophomore when he suddenly realized , reading e. e. cummings , that the word was " defunct " ; and a weirdly intense feeling of letdown washed over him . He hoped-being nineteen and of a lyrical turn of mind , Hooper remembers , had sucked nearly as much as being locked in a dung-filled cage-that adulthood would n't turn out to be just a long , languid drift away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same old tedious crap . Would he wake up one day to find himself with a wife and kids ? Would he be wearing hand-tooled boots , a manhole cover for a belt buckle ? Afraid so . And not long after that he 'd find tufts of fur bursting from his rapidly expanding ears , which would leave just the one sad step , or slide . We all make it : Hooper to funk . ) <p> Lenore named her ringtail Dobie . For weeks Hooper heard her droning at it , working her witchy will ; when he walked past her bedroom door he saw the monkey hanging upside-down from a dowel his father had mounted in the corner , and Lenore would clam up and glare and her nostrils would gape and she 'd point : There , my pretty , there is your target . The thing would-he swears it-turn its beastie head and bare its yellow teeth at him . <p> Lenore trained Dobie to attack whenever her brother made so bold as to leave his room . For a full year Hooper spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Lenore 's pint-sized goon , who wanted to claw open his skull and eat his brains . Hooper got used to the sound of Dobie skittering after him with murder in mind , got used to the excited nickering as the monkey looked for a gap in the defenses , inured himself to the sight and sound of its tiny , strangely beautiful fingernails as they roved over his face-shield . What Hooper could n't stand was the creature 's breath , a hybrid of brimstone and spoiled fruit . This stench was in his clothes , his thoughts , his dreams , was inside the helmet ... was inside his head . <p> For a time Hooper thought conspicuous terror was the key to vanquishing his enemy ; he 'd be so pitiful that his mom would have to step in and save him . He tiptoed around the house in his helmet , sweating , often with the screeching Dobie in pursuit . The situation finally came to a head when Mrs. Hooper got a call from school one day . Mrs. Warmoth could n't understand : she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children a Curious George book , and little Martin had dived under his desk and started whimpering . Was there trouble at home ? Did it involve-she did n't mean to meddle , but if you 'd seen what she saw-could it be possible that Martin had been , well , menaced , maybe by a lanky man in a yellow hat or possibly other yellow clothing ? These things could be taken care of nowadays by therapy-had anyone been making , you know , unnatural advances toward the boy ? <p> Her sympathies engaged ( nothing like public humiliation to do the trick ) , Hooper 's mom plumped that evening for banishment of the offender : " Rex , " she told her husband , " how do you expect Martin to grow up normal if he lives in a spacesuit and wears a monkey as a headdress ? What kind of life is a boy going to lead who 's scared to death of Curious George ? " This sensible argument looked like it might carry the day ... until Daddy 's little girl burst into tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a goddamn sissy in waiting , " he said , ignoring his wife 's shushing gestures . " Maybe being chased by Dobie 'll build him up some backbone . Now climb out from under the table and eat like a man , Martin . And get that geek flowerpot off your head . Fucking Buzz Aldrin . Just what the world needs : jarheads on Mars . " <p> So , left to his own devices , Hooper plotted for months-idly-to get rid of his foe . He 'd blow it up with M-80s ; sell it to the first organ grinder he happened across ; hire a swarthy hit man to whack it ; stab it with a stalactite from the eaves of the garage , then let the weapon melt untraceably away . He never did anything , mind you-and that , too , seemed a disappointment to his father . Imaginary vengeance was for pansies . A real boy would strangle his tormentor with bare hands and stomp the corpse into jelly . Hooper , unreal boy , dutifully strapped on his helmet whenever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got used to it : the constant sweating kept him from turning pudgy , and he liked the feeling of being in an echo chamber . He pretended he was on Apollo 2I , the mission to save all their sorry asses from hell , where Satan could be counted to sic her man-eating gargoyles on the astronauts ; once subdued , they 'd be flayed alive with giant emery boards . Hooper learned to play the TV loud so he could hear through plastic and over the frantic squeaks of his living wig . He snacked warily , his visor flipped up . He developed the only slightly paranoid notion that the world was fraught with perils that wanted to fly at your head . In short , Hooper made unmanly peace with his situation . To his shame , he learned to make do . <p> But then the monkey died . One day Dobie escaped and tried , with only fleeting success , to dangle by his tail from a high-voltage line . Hooper was immediately suspected . God , this was so simple : he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit , and some arcwelding expertise , and it turned out all you had to do was leave the side door ajar and the stupid thing would go fry itself posthaste . Hooper could n't be sure he had n't somehow done it ; at any rate Lenore was sure he did . " I 'll kill everything you love most , " she promised . " Pleasure is over for you , bucko . " She pointed her file at him . <p> This is where the guilt began . Hooper was thrilled , of course . He could barely contain his pleasure . He watched his father scrape the charred remains off the roof of the Carons ' van , and he felt like dancing . Had he really done it ? Had he juiced Dobie ? Had he started outside , come back in for a glass of Tang , seen the monkey scurry past and then pushed the door shut behind it ? As Dobie twitched and squealed and smoked on the wire , had Hooper watched from the window with a ghastly smile ? Had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commotion was about , " calmly dropped his helmet-once and for all-into the trash ? Memory is tricky ; Hooper has vivid recollections of all these things , but neither more nor less vivid than his memory of gutting the monkey with a porch icicle and then being foiled by that damnably clever kid detective , Encyclopedia Brown . No . . . surely that helmet was too big to fit in the narrow kitchen can , and even Hooper-even at nine-would have covered his tracks more cannily than that . But he 'd wanted Dobie dead , and then Dobie was dead . Was n't that enough ? All afternoon Lenore sobbed on the porch swing , her eyebrows bleeding down her checks . She seemed a scintilla less evil than usual . She 'd clawed at her coiffure in grief , rubbed away six inches of its height ; with lank hair and muted makeup she looked nearly human . When Hooper gave her a box of Kleenex , she did n't bother to threaten him . She took the tissue without looking up , honked loudly ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd planned to suck down a half-dozen Cokes and give Dobie a sarcastic twenty-one-belch sendoff , but he thought better of it . By the time his dad finished digging the hole , a pink Vesuvius of wadded tissue had mounted alongside Lenore , and it was almost kind of pathetic . Hooper 's euphoria had disappeared . The scritch of the shovel in wet earth-how could this be ? - seemed to him unutterably sad . Lenore made her father intone some fake Latin over the grave , and the four of them stood in the backyard and mumbled together . Hooper did not cry ; he did not . <p> Later , he overheard his parents discussing him . " That , " said his father , " is the most passive-aggressive child I 've ever seen . He 's got plenty of conniving , but no goddamn balls . " <p> " Rex , " scolded Hooper 's mom . " He seemed all broken up this afternoon . You do n't know that he had anything to do with it . " <p> " Oh , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was chivvying old Dobie into the body bag . Do you think it hurt a whole lot , Daddy ? Do you think it did ? " ' <p> Then , worriedly , Hooper 's mom : " What did you says I hope you were gentle . " <p> " Hell yes I was gentle . I said , ' Naw , Junior . Gettin ' sizzled to death feels kinda sweet , really . ' He just stood there and smirked at me . And all that pissing and moaning over the corpse is just one more example of the kid not having balls . For Christ 's sake , either kill Dobie or mourn him . You ca n't do both . " <p> What Hooper does n't want to admit is that maybe it 's the old passive aggression that got him in this reeking cage tonight . Maybe he not only wants his parents to know , but wants them to make the discovery in the most agonizing way possible . He can hear his father now : " Naw , Junior . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really . " <p> That would n't make Hooper smirk , but he ca n't say there would n't be a morsel of twisted pleasure in it . Maybe his dad was wrong : maybe you can kill those you love and then grieve for your victims . Maybe you have to . <p> 3 . <p> Hooper knows why the caged bird sings : nothing else to do . It 's quarter to ten . If he marched out of here and drove straight home , he might head them off . But his marching range , just now , is about eighteen inches . The trees have yielded no miracles , and wo n't . <p> So he pokes once more through the evening 's ruins . He left the CD shop , his final stop , at five to seven-had every intention of limping home , playing out his role in the sham he calls his own . But when he heard the final segment of All Things Considered , everything seemed to click into place . It was a report about That Asshole Breaux , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton candy because park attendance had plummeted . The creep admitted , too  --  proudly-to calling cosmetics firms , asking if they had work for a chimp who 'd outlived her usefulness : maybe they 'd want to run a few thousand volts through her , ream her with lipsticks to see if they were carcinogenic , something along those lines ? One company spotted a rare opportunity to make points with the animal rights lobby : Look ! Here 's a prick who 's worse than us ! They ratted Breaux out , and it became a national story . <p> Several things murkily entered into Hooper 's coming here tonight . Taffy 's situation was another black eye for Baton Rouge , which made news only for chemical spills , vampire cults , Nazi officeseekers . He felt a twinge of injured civic pride ; all those urbane Yankees in their Saabs and saltboxes would think the people of Red Stick were jackbooted Draculas who fed their chimps spun sugar and chipped wood . Say it loud , say it proud : Hooper had a surge of good citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to do something noble , more or less , and by God he needed it . Think globally , act locally : Hooper would take his cue from his brave colleagues with their brave bumper stickers . OK , so there was n't much he could accomplish , practically , to save this broken-down ape . But that was n't the point . Quixote got credit for his wigged-out shit because he meant well ; why should n't Hooper ? Sure , his thoughts were n't strictly rational right now ; but reason is the hobgoblin of puny minds , or however that goes . <p> And , all right , it did n't hurt that Taffy could play proxy for the long-dead Dobie , or that the mission would make Hooper , for once , a man not of thought but of action , the kind of son to be proud of . Maybe he needed to do penance in advance for the whoppers he 'd be telling his parents tonight . Who knows ? Maybe it just happened . <p> The wise feather consults the breeze ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he licked a finger and held it up to the cosmos , waiting for a tickle , a whisper , a nudge . The gods obliged . He was groping in his backseat for a suitable gift/bribe , and when-poof ! - he unearthed a cauliflower ( it must have dropped out on the trip home from the grocery last weekend ) , it seemed an omen : If you find a coarse-lobed white cabbage in your car , then by all means Visit the ape . Hooper , obedient to his auspices , cranked the car and aimed it toward Turvyland . <p> As quick as that-a pang of lunatic kindness , a cruel shove from the gods , and bingo ... instant , life-altering blunder . <p> Chance played a role as well-had the park been open , Hooper would never have gone through with it . He 'd have quit as usual . Maybe he was counting on that ; it was , after all , an August Friday night , prime time for Ferris wheels and fresh-squeezed lemonade . He 'd get to the park , discover an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried , I really did . " That might have been enough to appease his conscience-it did n't take much . But a group of angry locals had managed to get Turvyland shut down for a week on food-service violations . Worse , Hooper knew this already , though it surfaced into memory , dimly , only when he saw the bare flagpoles , the empty parking lot . Right , yes , he 'd heard about this ; but until now the knowledge had been just white noise , part of the constant background buzz of grievance to which Hooper paid no heed . God , everybody was pissed about something , and who had time to keep track ? <p> The radio report ( motive ) plus the deserted lot ( opportunity ) put him in business . And in truth , the adventure had n't started badly . He seemed to have a knack for the cloak-and-dagger ( the benefit of a clandestine life-you get practice at deception ) . He slyly bypassed the main lot , which abuts a busy street , then swung off the boulevard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funeral home , figuring they could n't chance towing the wheels of the bereaved . Then he set off to find a back way into Turvyland . <p> This was easier than expected . Hooper trekked across an abandoned putt-putt course that had , in the glory days , capitalized on the park 's overflow . Its fakey turf was now overrun by scrub-jack pine , elderberry , poison ivy , cat's-claw . Reclaimed by nature . Somebody had hauled off the windmill on one hole as a campy trophy or lawn ornament , and in its scar stood a cluster of yucca holding aloft a huge feather-duster bloom . The back nine abutted Turvyland 's rear fence , which was a litter-strewn sieve ; the chain-link had been rolled up or cut in half a dozen places , and he squeezed through , being careful not to his snag his suit . <p> Inside , he was surprised to discover how dinky the park was : maybe twenty acres of sidewalks heaved up by roots , trash migrating with the wind , dented food trailers , stagnant mini-ponds traversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far left perimeter was a clearing packed with rides , and the pissant menagerie was situated at the front , under a colonnade of live oaks . Hooper crept across Turvyland , dodging the wisps of paper that tumbled across his path . He had a kind of homing signal leading him on : the intermittent screak of the scarlet macaw that occupied Breaux 's second-biggest cage . <p> This was Hooper 's first venture into the park , but he had some idea of the setup . A few weeks ago he 'd overheard an acquaintance-a guy named Croft-decrying the conditions here . Croft was a volunteer docent at the city zoo , and a crusader of sorts ; he 'd played a role in getting the food inspectors out here . ( Croft was also gay , and a looker . But he suffered , at least by reputation , the activist 's typical malady : his overfed conscience had starved out any sense of humor . ) Croft had told Hooper 's friend Rick that there were , all told , a dozen animals , whatever elderly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were domestic critters he 'd trapped or hit with his car : a turkey too old and stringy for eating , an amputee armadillo , a goat who was short a horn ( the master impresario tried , for a time , to bill it as a unicorn ) ; and so on . There were a few oddities and exotics-the macaw , the albino otters , and of course Taffy-but they had n't set Breaux back much either . Turvyland was one of a dying breed , the roadside attraction , and it was easy to acquire animals from his old competitors as they retired . He offered to take these screeching liabilities off people 's hands , to save them feed and boarding costs . <p> Hooper made his way down the gallery of trees . The pens were arranged in a rough circle around the one showy cage , Taffy 's , and the chickenwire box that held the macaw . He reached the bird 's hutch first , and it was enough to ignite even his sluggish sense of injustice . It was a six-foot square made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hooper looked in at the bird , which was still jabbering angrily . Its plumage was lusterless , worn , ratty , but with remnants of beauty intact . The bird looked like a regent down on her luck-sitting on a park bench toping out of a sack , but still wearing her ermine collar and fading velvet cape . Hooper tapped on the wire , cooed at his new friend . He spoke no jungle bird , but he meant something like I 'm with you , babe . I feel your pain . <p> The macaw seemed only now to notice him . It flailed its wings , shrieked , hurled itself at him . Hooper leaped back just as the bird crashed into the wire ; it lay on the mossy floor of its hutch , stunned . Or maybe dead ... had Hooper managed to kill another blameless creature ? No , the bird was slowly reviving , regaining its bearings . It got up , tottered a few steps , then flew up to its dead-branch perch ; it fixed a dazed , hateful stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy ... and he had n't even met Taffy yet . He could see her now , though , over the top of the macaw 's quarters ; roused from her torpor by the noise next door , he guessed . She was standing with each hand wrapped around a bar , like the falsely accused in a prison flick . Hooper collected himself and moved on toward his goal . <p> In the car he 'd imagined a tender chat with Taffy , to let her know he was sorry she 'd been mistreated . The point was to be something like Not all humans are assholes ; I 'm here , eh ? Me friend of monkey many years . But what did he really want from her ? Absolution ? Advice ? Was he planning to spirit her home , wrap her in a blanket and nurse her to health so she could make her space mission and save us from the Russkies after all ? Things had turned turbid on him again . He felt his high purpose evaporating . This break-in was starting to take on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What else was new ? His was a life full of misguided whims pushed and pushed until they yielded , sometimes spectacularly , the irresistible secret at their core . The siren song of debacle : I know this is dumb , but why ? Only one way to find out ... <p> He was n't prepared . A fillip of breeze carried the same nasty odor Dobie 'd had years before , and Hooper felt the old fear and loathing shudder over him . Taffy had let the bars loose , backed off ; she was poised on her knuckles and the balls of her feet , waiting to see what fresh torture this human had to offer . <p> She was such a different animal . She was huge , comparatively speaking ; Dobie had weighed maybe ten pounds , but Taffy must be five feet tall , one-fifty . Heavier than Hooper . This was not a monkey one could wear on one 's head ; this was not a pet , not a prop for one 's personal drama . And she looked-with her wrinkled features , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world-weary , so sad and smart , so old . It 's a cliche , but so human . <p> Now was his moment . Do or die . Sink or swim . But what to say ? Hooper half-expected the same reception he got from the macaw down yonder ; but the chimpanzee did n't fling herself at the bars , did n't hiss or bare her teeth . She sat there patiently , waiting for Hooper to reveal his reason for coming . He did n't know , could n't tell . His mind had gone blank . He looked down for a second , and when he raised his eyes he saw that Taffy had turned her back , was splayed out near the bars . The light was beginning to fail , but there was no mistaking this shocking incarnadine flash . Hooper blinked at the vivid red of her genitalia , and Taffy swung her head sideways , to gauge his response . Was she ... rear-presenting ? This was more forgiveness than Hooper had bargained for . Another lie exposed : he 'd envisioned talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to a wanton chimp that , in more ways than one , you 're not that kind of guy ? Hooper swallowed hard a few times , examined his shoes , the cage 's concrete pedestal , the dying ring of Mexican heather surrounding it . <p> He snapped to attention when the first glob hit his forehead . What ? What ? Hooper started talking fast , bobbing and weaving , babbling reassurances , explaining himself . He was n't really a monkey-killer , it had n't happened but that once , and then it was the power company 's fault , and half-suicide , and there 'd been plenty of provocation , and ... <p> But the more agitated Hooper got , the more frenziedly Taffy pelted him with her poop . She was flinging it hard , chattering all the while . She 'd made a generous offer on behalf of her family and gender , and he 'd rebuffed her , rejected them all . Forgiveness was never to be his . What kind of pervert was he ? <p> It was at this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soul and dodging her crumbly shit-missiles , that the real commandos had arrived to save her . <p> 4 . <p> On his way home from school this afternoon , Hooper figured he 'd buy a Johnny Mercer disc . He has so little in common with his parents that he 's willing to stoop to ploys like this . The plan : he 'd put on mutually agreeable music , Mom and Pop would bob their heads out of politeness or appreciation , and then-since they were enjoying it so much-he 'd accidentally turn Johnny up too loud , choke the talk to a trickle . A quick jog through his sanitized apartment ( which his father 's never seen ) , a few drowned-out pleasantries , and his parents would plead exhaustion and retire to the hotel . The worst would then be past : tomorrow he 'd give a campus tour ( with emphasis on Huey Long 's brazen frauds , which would strike his dad as heroic ) ; they 'd eat crawfish , try to wrap their country tongues around the phrase Laissez le bon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little tourists . By Sunday noon Hooper 's parents would be safely on the road , and his elf candles and Tzabaco catalogues would be restored to prominence . <p> The hard part was tonight . The vision of his parents sitting on that couch , in that room , among the ghostly reverberations of Hooper 's pleasure-cries ... the idea of the carton in his bedroom closet that would contain every secret flamboyance of his new life . Unbearable . It would be a kind of Telltale Box , pulsing under the floorboards for as long as the elder Hoopers stayed . And the phone might ring at any moment : " Buona sera , Geppetto . How 's about making me a real boy ? " So Johnny had better be in good-make that loud-voice this evening . <p> It was n't just fear of discovery , though . Hooper felt awful about not confiding in his mother . She was a saint , loved him no matter what ; she 'd never abandon him . But sainthood had a drawback , too , its rigid rule of honesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . Which left him in a tough spot . <p> The most uncomfortable thing to admit to himself , the most vexed and tangled aspect of all , was that he 'd been battling pangs of dissatisfaction , even shame . Not about preferring men , certainly-his sexuality was what he wanted ; it was his identity , his genetic destiny . No control over that . But ... the way he 'd been going about it ? His vita nuova had started with an almost ecstatic burst of lust , and for a time that seemed to Hooper the point . Being gay was , after all , a " sexual preference " ; what defined you was having sex , so the more you had , the gayer you were . Every erotic kick during the first few months had been deepened , redoubled , by the knowledge that he was finally celebrating who he was , who he is . <p> But lately the slap-and-tickle 's lost its luster . Over the past few months he 's embraced not only a string of men but also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the things he cares about most ; and this turns out to be at least as important as the physical stuff . Hooper would n't go so far as to say he 's happiest when devising a costume for Lazarus , the glorious gay masque in New Orleans ; or sitting among friends and snorting over the vacuous speeches and fashion abortions of Oscar night ; or trading Cole Porter couplets over Bloody Marys on the porch at The Columns , the rundown hotel that played the whorehouse in Pretty Baby ... but he 's definitely happy at those times . What he 's bought into is a ready-made world for exploring : these are stereotypes , but ones he can tweak and use , take on or off as he chooses-swish today , butch tomorrow ; Paris esthete now , Hindsville redneck later-to puzzle out who he is , in all his moods and incarnations . He 's learning himself . <p> Hooper remembers , for example , how wonderful it was the first time he ate with friends at the Ho Chi Minh Grill , in the Quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates , but it 's whisked to the tables by gorgeous androgynes got up like Carmen Miranda . He watched one sashay across the room to take their order , meanwhile adjusting his cornucopia . Admit it : if confronted by a cross-dressing Ganymede toting a platter of larb , could you mumblingly order a Bud ? You could not , do not . Instead you say something glib , racy , goofy : " My , what fine firm fruit you have . You look yummy enough to pit . " You ask for a " Pimm 's cup , super-extra Pimmy , darling . " And then , amid the stained velvet curtains and tinkling mismatched glassware and bouzouki music ( the place is velly eclectic ) and the smooth , lovely boys with their falsies and pineapples , you begin to appreciate the extent to which being gay is about making your life a perpetual festival ; it 's a way of living at a higher emotional pitch than the drones and burghers and mudsticks can manage . It 's all so clever and bubbly and bright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a graduate of Vanderbilt , a wearer of silk bowties-for once you 're part of a living , breathing minority community . You 're among the oppressed . <p> Which is n't to say that the sex does n't matter , or is n't good-it is , cher , it is . But the most liberating thing about Hooper 's transformation may be that he has , at last , an audience for his catty wit , has friends eager and able to engage-raucously , passionately-in repartee about anything from Lotte Lenya to L. L. Cool J , Lincoln logs to L. L. Bean . <p> When Hooper 's lust began to ebb , it raised ugly questions : Could he have been wrong ? Had this been , after all , just a bout of hedonism that would now pass ? The answer to each of these was no-he was sure of it-but nevertheless he felt disconcerted , cranky . He grew hypersensitive to insults , slights , fishy glances ; he found himself looking for chances to vent righteous indignation . And the less randy Hooper felt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department friend , Anja , his lunch partner three times a week , was the first to complain . She 's been picking at him of late for becoming a cliche , with his fifty-dollar avocado hair products and crisply pressed chinos and snatches of opera-and the way he interrupts her a dozen times , during the walk across campus to lunch , to leer at some " feshing youf . " Her smiles at his lechery have grown fainter , and two weeks ago , when he started rhapsodizing once again about a passing sprite , she lit into him . <p> " The poor thing does n't know he 's gay yet . But he is , darlin ' , he is , " Hooper said . <p> " Martin , " sighed Anja , rolling her eyes , " this is tired . At first it was kind of cute-you were a teenager again , drowning in hormones . But there 's getting to be something creepy about it . You bitch about the Bible-bangers assuming you 're on the make all the time ... but hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean you personally . What makes that kid gay is that you have the hots for him . No more , no less . " <p> " Well , true colors at last , " Hooper answered . " I never figured you for a ... " <p> " Come off it , " said Anja . " I would n't like you being a hetero lounge lizard either . And why put on a show for my sake ? I know who you are ; you suit me fine . " She paused ; her look turned affectionate , nervous . " Besides , I worry about you , Hoop . " <p> This was perilously close to a subject Martin refused to talk about , think about . It called-without delay-for a lightsome dodge , a retreat . He summoned up his best Noel Coward . " No , no . I worry about you , Sopping Blanket . Being so dreary violates God 's law , and one of these days you 'll pay . Pre-verts always do . It 's unnatural . " <p> Anja 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice and not by nature ; it 's unfathomable . Hooper 's new playmates think she 's a waste , an unfun person from good-fun stock . Her bloodlines are impeccable : in 1970 , in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs , Anja 's mother published a treatise based on emergency-tent research at Grateful Dead and Led Zeppelin concerts held on consecutive weekends in San Francisco . Zep fans , she concluded , grooved on hallucinogens , while Deadheads stuck mainly to grass . Or maybe , she hedged , Deadheads-being of naturally sunny disposition and possessing greater pharmacological expertise , were just less prone to uncool freakouts and bad trips in public . Anja 's father had postponed college for an eight-month stint as a hobo , and once , trying to relive the salad days , he led the family on an ill-fated vacation-Anja will say only " It was n't Disney World " - that involved riding the rails of Appalachia , roughing it on abandoned sidings , cooking over oil drums . <p> Their daughter , flesh of their flesh , teaches idiot frosh how to write persuasive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see Anja in the cafe , reading some earnest drudge like Doris Lessing , and he 'll have a trippy vision of her mother at Kezar , laughing with a bored orderly while " The Crunge " booms overhead . She has a pad on which to catalogue concertgoers ' impairments . She takes a last drag , asks , " You figure that purple-faced guy in the dashiki was speeding ? " Letting this image fade , Hooper focuses on Anja-no makeup , muted clothes , Pilgrim shoes with buckles  --  drinking her unaugmented coffee . She has a habit , when the cup is empty , of soaking up any spillage on the saucer with a napkin , then softly tamping the cup-bottom dry . It does n't compute . And yet she seems perfectly content , in her way . <p> Theirs is a weird friendship , but it 's lasted . Despite the differences of personality , they genuinely like each other . He teases her about how boring she is ; she makes him eat at McDonald 's to get in touch with his grease-loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity , Hoop , " she says . " I 'll settle for the waistline kind . " <p> Today , as they made their way from the Golden Arches back to their offices , Anja took on a solemn look . " Hoop , " she said , " I 'm sorry , but I ca n't help you tonight . I just would n't feel right about it . " Hooper had asked if she 'd drop by , maybe pretend in a low-key way that they 're an item . She 's the only woman he ever talks about , and his parents have assumed ... But Hooper knew all along that she 'd say no ; masquerades were n't Anja 's style . So he 'd already constructed a cover story to account for her absence : tonight , alas , she has to be up at Angola , teaching Death Row inmates to write sonnets . She 's so compassionate , he 'll say , so devoted to the civilizing effects of education . He 's proud of his Anja . Maybe for good measure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for the Big Jolt if they 've mastered rhyme schemes . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Anja repeated . She reached into her bookbag , handed Hooper a folded manuscript . " A present , " she muttered . " A little something I 've been working on . You know , trying to dry the blanket a little . I 'm thinking of becoming maybe a little amusing , now and then , but I do n't want to embarrass myself . Let me know what you think . And please do n't take it the wrong way ... <p> That last remark would have set him to furious reading on the spot , but there was n't time . Hooper had three hours of student conferences scheduled , and by the time he and Anja trudged upstairs to the department , two early arrivals were huddled outside his door . When Hooper finally closed the door behind the last supplicant , settled into his chair , and reached into his drawer for the trusty flask of bourbon , he spotted Anja 's manuscript on the desktop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop was open until seven , and that would leave time to eat a leisurely dinner , smoke a dessert joint , and hide all incriminating material at home . He uncrimped the pages and began to read , with steadily increasing amazement : <p> Hooper Gets a Perm <p> Adrift and abed , again . As Hooper watched the late-morning sun drift across the floor , he did a bit of stock-taking . Hooper , old boy , he told himself-he was prone , in taking stock , to the pompous : where better than in fancy to be fancy ? - Hooper , old boy , what you need ... what you need , for true , is a half-decent inner life . His face was puffy , his mouth dry , and his filmy teeth ached ; he might feel rotten , but Hooper knew a truth when he thought one . The word desideratum popped into his head . Desideratum : an improved inner life . Hooper had a sudden flush of pride . How many of the hurt and hungover were marking the sun 's creep across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner lives ? How many had marshaled a five-syllable word to the cause ? Hooper could n't vouch for anyone else , but he for one was no ordinary lush . <p> His reverie was interrupted by the sound of a bandsaw or fan belt or something in the kitchen ; the noise gradually resolved itself into what Hooper could identify as a horrific imitation of Glynis Johns singing " Send in the Clowns . " Wincing , he glanced over to see that last night 's hugger-mugger of hastily shed clothes was undisturbed in its place by the door . Oh , Lord ... another night of passion mislaid , youth and money misspent , pearls miscast before swine . And this morning 's misgruntlement , mis  --  satisfaction , misgust . Old hat , all of it . Another pretty-boy th his kitchen , in the buff , squeezing citrus and singing Sondheim . Another little serving-wench with sticky knuckles and bad taste ; another hole that would need digging out of . The mind boggled ; the mind boggled . <p> Hooper rolled over , ground fists into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast trays as his consort-what was this one 's name : Chap ? Henryk ? Testostero ? - made ready to sweep him away via petit dejeuner . Hooper knew he would not , could not , resist . How to spurn a man who stole out of bed to make you breakfast ? One resourceful enough to make a tarnished jigger serve for an egg cup , a lens-cleaner for a cozy ? Whose perfect moons of fingernail held scraps of pulp from fruits he ruined just for you ? And if the egg-a beautiful tan thing , coddled in its prim Victorian cup and cap-if the egg were echoed , just below the advancing tray , by two of its flawless brethren , and if he 'd wrapped Hans ( semi-erect , left-leaning , flopping with every step ) with pungent slices of bacon . . . tell me the word desideratum would n't take on a new meaning for you , too . <p> When breakfast was past , the world seemed supernally bright , and Hooper was in no mood anymore for the petty agonies of contemplation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time to begin an overhaul of the soul , not with the tang of bacon on his lips and the word Sizzlean tumbling delightfully through his mind . Not this morning . The inner life be damned , today , IMG
