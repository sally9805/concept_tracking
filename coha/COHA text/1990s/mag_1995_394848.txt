As Earth moves around the Sun , the constellations we associate with winter evenings continue their westward march . In another couple of months , their distinctive shapes and asterisms will disappear into the sunset glare . Rising out of the twilight is the young Moon , which appears above the western horizon in the first days of March and spends about a week as a crescent in the west after sunset . It passes eastward through a large asterism known as the Winter Circle while waxing toward First Quarter on March 9 . The stars of the Winter Circle  --  made up of Orion 's Rigel , Canis Major 's Sirius , Canis Minor 's Procyon , Gemini 's Pollux and Castor , Auriga 's Capella , and Taurus ' Aldebaran  --  are some of the brightest we see from Earth . When we look toward them , we are looking in a direction opposite the center of our Milky Way Galaxy and into the spiral arm containing our Sun . In a dark , moonless sky , it 's easy to trace the faint band of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the east and northeast during the evening hours lie two more prominent star patterns , or asterisms . One is the Big Dipper in the constellation Ursa Major , the Greater Bear . The Big Dipper ascends in the northeast on March evenings , beginning its most conspicuous time of year for evening viewing . The two stars that represent the front of the Dipper 's bowl are Dubhe and Merak . Also called the Pointers , a line connecting them points to Polaris , the North Star . Follow the arc in the Big Dipper 's handle to the bright star Arcturus in the constellation Bootes . Then " drive a spike " to Spica ; in other words , continue your imaginary arc to the bright star Spica in the constellation Virgo . The second pattern is an asterism called the Sickle in the constellation Leo , the Lion . Modern stargazers who have little experience with farm implements more readily identify this pattern with a backward question mark . The brightest star at the bottom of the question mark is Regulus , also known as Cor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intruder lies west of the Sickle . This object 's steady light , in contrast to the twinkling stars , betrays its true nature as a planet . It 's the planet next outward from Earth in orbit around the Sun : Mars , a windswept world of swirling red desert sands . Earth passed between this planet and the Sun last month , when Mars was at opposition to the Sun . Planets at opposition rise when the Sun sets , but of course Earth never stops moving and Mars is now well up in the east after the Sun goes down . Because we are still fairly close to Mars  --  only six light-minutes away when this month begins  --  it now shines like a red beacon at magnitude - 0.9 . Look for a gibbous Moon near the planet on the night of March 13 . Mars crosses into Cancer around the middle of March . At that time , it moves in a retrograde manner , westward in front of the stars . Mars is stationary on March 25 , thereafter resuming an eastward motion . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring . Through a telescope Mars shows a 12 " - diameter disk , still large enough to show dark areas that change from one hour to the next as Mars rotates . These changes are due to the Martian winds , which transport large quantities of light and dark dust from one region to another . Further east in the sky is a world far beyond the relative closeness of Mars . Pluto ascends in the east around midnight in early March . This double world ( its moon Charon is quite large compared to Pluto ) is about a thousand times too faint to see with the eye , at magnitude 13.7 . Even large telescopes reveal only a starry point that moves slowly this month through the constellation Scorpius . Pluto is stationary on March 6 and afterward moves in a retrograde , or westward , manner in front of the stars . We pass between it and the Sun in May . Jupiter rises around 1:30 a.m. in early March , and by the month 's end slips into the late evening sky . The giant planet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 43 light-minutes . We will pass between it and the Sun in early June . Though Jupiter is near Scorpius ' bright star Antares , it 's officially in Ophiuchus . The Moon appears near this planet on the morning of March 12 . Blazing Venus rises a couple of hours before the Sun in early March and appears low in the southeast before dawn . At magnitude - 4.1 , it is the brightest object in the sky besides the Sun and Moon . Venus has two companions in the predawn sky when the month begins . Uranus and Neptune emerge from the dawn and creep up behind Venus . You will need optical aid to see them . Mercury reaches greatest western elongation on March 1 , when it is 27deg west of the Sun and visible in a cloudless eastern predawn sky some 15deg to the lower left of Venus . Look early in March ; it disappears again before midmonth . Mercury has a conjunction with Saturn on March 25 that 's difficult to see in the morning glare . The equinox comes on March 20 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equator . At each of the year 's two equinoxes , neither pole is in 24-hour darkness . The Sun bathes our whole planet in its light and warmth for half of each day . Unless you are standing at a pole , the celestial equator always intersects the horizon at points due east and due west ( at the poles , the celestial equator forms the horizon line ) . Thus on the day of the equinox , the sunrise and sunset points mark due east and west . For fun , use a piece of tape on a window to note the Sun 's location at sunrise or sunset ; then watch over the coming months as the Sun 's rising and setting points shift northward . The ecliptic , or Sun 's path around the sky , is distinctive at every season for the angle it makes with the eastern and western horizons in both morning and evening twilight . Around the equinoxes , the angle of the ecliptic is especially pronounced . From the Northern Hemisphere , the ecliptic stands nearly straight up with respect to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle with the horizon before dawn . Thus Mercury during this morning apparition is harder to see than it would .. otherwise be this month . And the steep angle of the ecliptic to the evening horizon causes a longer-than-usual time between moonrises on successive nights around this month 's Full Moon . The Moon usually rises about 50 minutes later each day . On successive nights around March 16 , the Full or nearly Full Moon rises more than an hour later . As an observing project in March , look for a very young crescent Moon . Since two New Moons occur this month , you have two chances , first on March 2 and again on March 31 ( See " Spot a Young Moon , " page 68 ) . Look within half an hour after sunset , low in the west . A young Moon appears as the slimmest of crescents , as fragile against the bright twilight as any green plant now emerging to greet the spring .
