Three weeks into the process and David Souter no longer merits 30 seconds on the evening news . Having uncovered next to nothing that seems capable of hampering Souter 's Supreme Court nomination , the media have turned their attention elsewhere . The White House is ecstatic . George Bush 's aides are predicting a smooth confirmation . <P> Their optimism is misplaced , but even if they are right , a political time + bomb is ticking . If a Justice Souter votes to weaken or overturn Roe v. Wade before Bush faces re-election in 1992 , the President will be castigated for having smuggled an abortion foe onto the court without a fair fight . Few will believe that Bush did n't know all along that Souter would affirm the Republican Party 's call to gut the landmark abortion-rights decision . <P> For politicians , abortion is a character issue . Those candidates who state their views unblinkingly are usually conceded the courage of their convictions and rise or fall for other reasons . Those who waffle or engage in subterfuge usually lose . To avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough Senate grilling of Souter 's abortion position . <P> Whatever Bush 's final strategy , Souter himself appears willing to join the battle straight-up . He apparently realizes that regardless of where a nominee stands on an issue , a candidate for the high court owes the nation an account of why he stands there . Some people who are close to Souter say he has already decided to discuss the right to privacy on which Roe rests . Many conservatives ( and some liberals , including the late Justice Hugo Black ) insist privacy is an invented liberty without constitutional foundation . Let Souter second Black , if that be his position , and then echo those liberal scholars like Raoul Berger who say Roe was wrongly decided ( although Berger , at least , applauds the opinion 's result ) . Then , if Souter is confirmed , the electorate will not feel cheated . <P> Whether candor can win the day for Souter is another matter . Some Senators believe he could deny a constitutional right to privacy and still prevail , provided his reported respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If that is indeed the message Souter wishes to convey , he could do worse than borrow from Robert Bork . " Many court results decided incorrectly have been left in place because tearing them up would create chaos , " says Bork . <P> Would such a stance wash ? Perhaps , but " the stakes are much higher this time , " says Senator Arlen Specter , a Pennsylvania Republican whose opposition doomed Bork 's 1987 court nomination . " Bork 's vote to overturn Roe would not have made the difference . Souter 's would . " <P> Clearly , the current calm is illusory . Souter 's confirmation is no done deal . In one way or another , abortion will be the litmus test that determines Souter 's fate . In the end , he could be rejected simply because he believes ; that legislators should make the law , that the right to abortion is a matter best left for the states to decide . <P> The trouble with all this is that today 's divisive ideological issues are not always tomorrow 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows what the hot buttons will be ? What the Senate should explore is the creativity and intellectual distinction of a nominee , not how he would vote on a specific case next week . Unfortunately , those are the kind of questions that may never be asked .
