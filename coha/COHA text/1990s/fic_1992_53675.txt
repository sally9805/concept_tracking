When Burns arrived in Kotzebue , they were shooting the dogs . He 'd never been to Alaska before and it seemed without compromise . Weather had kept him in Nome for two days where he 'd seen a saloon fire . He 'd been across the street in a shop buying chocolate and bottled water , and the eerie frozen scene mesmerized him . As the flames pulsed from both windows in the sharp wind and the crews sprayed water which caked on the wooden structure instantly as ice , the patrons emerged slowly , their collars up in the weather , drinks in their gloved hands . Burns was n't drinking . He sipped water and ate chocolate in his hotel room listening to the wind growl . Then the short hop over to Kotzebue was the roughest flight of his life , the plane pitching and dropping , smacking against the treacherous air . Burns could hear dogs barking in the front hold and they helped . It 's a short flight , he thought , and they would n't crash with dogs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until a wizened , leather-faced Inuit came up to him and grinned , showing no teeth , and lifted his suitcase into the back of an orange International pickup . Burns followed the man and got into the truck . The cab was rife with the smell of bourbon , and four or five bottles rolled around Burns 's feet . The man smiled again , his eyes merry , and drove onto the main road of the village , where they fell behind the sheriff 's white truck . There were two men in the back with rifles riding in the cold . Kotzebue was gray under old drifts but the wind had ripped the tops from some of the banks and spread new whiter fans of snow across the road . The high school was letting out and three-wheelers and snow machines cruised along the road , both sides , and cut the corners at every crossroad . <p> Suddenly , the two men in the sheriff 's truck stood and raised their rifles , shooting into a field behind the buildings . Each shot twice and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the men fell to the ice and got back up and followed his partner running into the field . <p> " What 's going on ? " Burns asked , but his driver only squinted at him and shook his head slightly . Burns could see the two men standing over a dark form in the snow . He saw one of them shoot again . The man behind the wheel of the sheriff 's truck lifted a hand , but Burns 's driver did not wave back . <p> Two streets later , the orange International turned into a narrow off-street and stopped in front of an ice-coated trailer . The man unloaded the suitcase and held out four fingers . The way he tapped them made Burns understand . <p> " Miss Munson will be back at four ? " <p> The man nodded and reached behind Burns and opened the trailer 's door . Whiskey , Burns thought , as he watched the man return to the truck and drive off . A thick drift of whiskey moved with the man . As Burns lifted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newfoundland on a chain rose from a doghouse half-buried in the snow , shook , and looked up expectantly . It took Burns a moment to recognize the dog , and then he knelt down and ran his hand through the fur . " Molly , you pup , " he said . " You grew up . " There was a muffled clamor from the roadway and Burns turned to see a passenger fall from a three-wheeler , slide along on his back for ten yards , then climb back on behind the driver . It had begun to snow faintly in the early afternoon , and the tiny dots of frozen snow were sparse in the gloom . Burns scratched the dog again . " Molly , " he said . " What happened to Alec ? " <p> In the close warmth of the trailer , Burns again found himself craving food . The cold left him ravenous . In Nome after his daily walks he would fall upon his stash of chocolate like a schoolboy . And now , he barely took time to hang his gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen before he was stuffing the candy into his mouth . It was amusing to be so aware of his body after so many years . <p> There was a stomping , felt more than heard , and Burns saw light in the entry as the door opened and closed . " Hello ! " a man 's voice called , and a large bearded man in a blue military parka came into the kitchen , pulling off his glove and extending a hand to Burns . " You picked one hell of a week , " the man said , shaking Burns 's hand . " Glen Batton . I 'm the Forest Service here , and "  --  he added in another tone  --  " a friend of Julie 's . " <p> Burns said his name and Glen Batton went ahead with the weather report about a new Siberian front moving in . " If it cleared , I 'd fly you out to Kolvik myself . As is , you 'll be lucky to get down to the Co-op for candy . " Batton pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry about your son . " <p> Burns nodded . <p> " You 're from Connecticut . ' <p> " Yes . Connecticut . " <p> Glen Batton put his glove back on . " Well , listen , I just wanted to introduce myself and offer my services , though that may be useless . How long are you here ? " <p> " I 'm not sure , " Burns said . " I need to get out to Kolvik . " <p> " Well , you wo n't do that , " Glen said , moving back to the door , " but have a nice visit . I 'll probably see you Friday at the hospital party . " <p> " Why are the police shooting the dogs ? " <p> " Strays , " Batton said . " Too many loose dogs raising hell with the teams . Count the dogs in this town sometime . " He turned to leave , but came back into the room . " Hey , listen . You may need to know a couple of things . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look , what happened to Alec is a bad deal , but it happens all the time . People do n't understand this country . They think they can handle it , but you ca n't handle it . " <p> " I see , " Burns said . <p> " And I should tell you this . " Glen Batton looked quickly away and back . " Julie is a little fragile about this whole deal . Your visit a year after it all happened . We 've talked about it . I do n't know what your plans are , but you may want to step lightly . " <p> " I will . " <p> " If it gets tight , you can always bunk wit , h me or at the hotel . " <p> " Thank you . I 'll remember that , " Burns said , holding Glen 's look until the bearded man turned and left . Now he wanted a drink , blood sugar or no blood sugar ; Burns could feel the call in his gut , his heartbeat , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drew and drank three glasses of water . <p> Burns heard a fuss outside and then the clatter of claws on the linoleum of the entry and the Newfoundland came bounding in and burrowed his nose into Burns 's hand where it hung beside the easy chair in which he slept . He had sat down to read in the small living room , and sleep had taken him like an irrefutable force . Now a woman appeared in in the entrance , and that was Burns 's first thought : she 's not a girl . He had last seen his son Alec six years ago when he had graduated college in New Haven . Burns had expected his wife to be a girl . Julie removed her knee-length lavender parka and the white knit cap and shook her hair , smiling at him . Without meaning to , Burns stared frankly at her in her white nurse 's dress . It was the first surprise he 'd had since he 'd been in Alaska : Julie was a woman , a tall woman with pale blond hair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . <p> " What are you smiling at ? " she said and smiled . " Sit down , Tom . I 'm going to call you Tom , O.K. ? I 'm glad you 're here . How was your flight ? " Burns felt things shifting . First all the hunger and then the nap taking him like a kid and now this woman in white . <p> " I fell asleep , " he said . " Sorry . " <p> " It 's too warm in here . " Julie went to the thermostat . " That 's the one thing about Alaska . It 's too warm all the time . There 's no such thing as a little cold . They keep the hospital at eighty degrees . It reminds me of Manhattan that way . " She sat on the couch and took off her shoes . " Alec talked about you quite a lot . And so did Helen , but you 're quite different than I pictured . " <p> " Oh ? " <p> She stood up , her dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Water 's fine . " <p> " That 's right . I knew that . Sorry . " Burns watched her splash some Wild Turkey into a plastic tumbler . " O.K. , I 'll be right back . I 've got to get these stockings off . Yes , from Helen I imagined you 'd be a bit wrecked or frumpy , you know , dirty overcoat , greasy hair . " <p> " Bottle of Tokay ? " <p> " I 'm kidding , but your ex-wife can be a bit severe . " <p> " Helen is a woman with a memory . " <p> Julie went down a short hallway where Burns could see the edge of a bed . When he saw her dress fall upon the bed , he stood and moved to the kitchen sink , poured a glass of water and tried to see out the frosted window . He felt agitated . He pressed the glass against his lip . He was deeply hungry again and he felt funny about falling asleep . Napping was n't his custom , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the structure , rocking it faintly , had just taken him . He had been doing things by will for ten years now , since the first week after his forty-second birthday , and he was known as a measured man who had placed the remaining components of his life back together purposefully . He was a man who did n't feel things instantly , and now there was this person , Julie , whom he instantly felt quite wonderful about , and suddenly his mission seemed strange and he felt far from home . <p> She returned in a worn pair of brown corduroys and a simple white turtleneck . His room was at the other end of the trailer , and as she laid out some towels , Burns could n't take his eyes from her . <p> " Blazo picked you up all right ? " she said . <p> " The talkative soul ? The whiskey person ? " <p> As she moved about the room showing him the bureau and the electric blanket control and the closet , he studied her long arms , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold necklace , the rise of her collarbones under the fabric of her pullover . <p> " He ca n't talk . He drank some heating fuel years ago . Blazo . He drank some Blazo and does n't talk , but he 's a gem . He is the mechanic to trust in this village . " <p> Julie had pale green eyes and a faint spray of freckles across her nose and forehead . Burns put her at about thirty . He felt like a teenager sneaking looks at her breasts . He had n't seen a woman in a turtleneck sweater for twenty years . There was an angry red scar on her neck protruding from her shirt which stunned him at first , and then he realized it was a violin mark . Alec had had one . <p> Burns heard two concussions from outside and then two more , the distant snapping of gunfire . He held onto the sink and felt the wind pull at the trailer and he thought : Do n't touch her . Do n't you touch this woman . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Burns tried to eat slowly . " I appreciate your putting me up like this , " he said . " I 'm genuinely sorry we have n't met until now . " <p> " Tom , do n't start apologizing . I mean it . This is Alaska , there is n't room . " Julie looked at him squarely . " I understand about the wedding and Alec did , too . Believe me . And you were right not to come . It was Helen 's show , really . " She sipped her bourbon then lifted a finger from the rim and pointed at him . " I 'm not kidding . " <p> " I just want to see where he lived out there , where he . . . I missed so much , and now I just want to see what it 's like here . " <p> " This is what it 's like , dark and windy , lots of accidents . " <p> " I spoke with Helen before I came and she simply wanted you to know that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever needed anything she would help . She was quite sincere . " <p> Julie placed her glass carefully on the table . " I know . We 've spoken about the funeral . He was n't my husband anymore , of course . We were only married the one year . And I had n't seen him for months . I tried to handle everything I could at this end , but I could n't go down to the States and get all involved in a world which was n't there anymore . You went out ? " <p> " I did , " Burns said . " I finally went to something . " <p> Burns ate slowly , his hunger a fire that had him on the edge of his chair . He felt oddly alert . " Who found Alec ? " <p> " Glen reported the cabin burn on his return from a caribou count and the Search and Rescue went out from here . You can see Lloyd tomorrow , the sheriff . It was his men . " <p> They were quiet for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the living-room rug , watch him . All of these things had happened , Alec 's wedding , divorce , death , in half a dog 's life . <p> " So , you 're Thomas Burns , " Julie said , smiling again . " It is just a little weird to see you . " <p> " That 's the way everybody seems to be taking it . " <p> " Well , Glen is convinced you 're a cop . " She pointed at his clean plate . " Still hungry ? " <p> " No , " he lied . He stood and set his dishes in the sink . " Is there need for a cop ? " <p> She joined him at the counter and spoke softly . " No . It 's an unhappy story , but we 've got all the cops we need . " She stopped him from clearing the table . " Come on , I better take you down to the Tahoe before my students get here . All visitors go to the Tahoe . The largest bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , it 's a good walk , and next week in Darien , you can say you 've seen it once , tell stories . " <p> Outside in the heavy wind , Burns and Julie shuffled along the hard , snow-packed roadway . The dark was gashed by several flaring arc lights above the armory and the high school , new brick buildings built with the first oil surplus money . Several vehicles passed them at close range , snow machines and three-wheelers bulletin " by , and as Burns shied from them , he bumped Julie several times , saying , " Sorry , I 'm not used to this . " <p> " It 's all right . They 're not either , " she said , pointing to the way the small vehicles cut the corners at every intersection , their paths running across open yards and slicing very close to the buildings . The drivers would n't slow down at all around these shortcuts . Burns cringed watching them disappear . They 'll be killed , he thought . They 'll crash head-on with someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie did n't speak in the pressure of the cold . They stopped several times to pick things from the roadway : a scarf , a big leather mitten , and at the corner where they turned for the bar , a loaf of bread , still soft . He found such litter alarming , but Julie only smiled and told him simply , " Bring it along . " <p> The Tahoe was a large metal building which looked like a one-story warehouse . Julie led him up the iced steps and across the wide porch into the big barroom . Inside the door , in the dark , one booth was stacked high with miscellaneous gear : sweaters , hats , and gloves . Julie told him , " Put your treasures right there . It 's the lost and found . " The vast room was gloomy and crowded . As Burns 's eyes adjusted , he saw that the booths were full of Inuit , and though the room was warm and redolent of cigarettes and fur , few people had taken their coats off . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'd like a vanilla shake , " Burns said . " This country has got me starved . But I 'll take a soda water , anything , really . " <p> It was not an animated bar . Burns could see four school board members who were on his flight standing at the bar , talking , but they were the loudest group . The dark dusters of natives huddled around the tables and booths in the room spoke quietly if at all . Even the pool players moved with a kind of lethargy . Burns stood by the end of the bar , his stomach growling as he thawed . He 'd been in lots of bars and this was possibly the largest . In the old days , after martinis at his club , he 'd hit every hole-in-the-wall on the way to Grand Central , eventually taking the last train to Connecticut , the ride as cloudy and smeared as the windows . He had n't been a sloppy drunk ; he 'd been a careful drunk . The word was serious  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious young man , who had married seriously and become a serious attorney , who drank seriously and became a serious drunk . The mistakes he made were serious and now , in the Arctic Circle , he thought of himself in the Tahoe as a serious visitor on a serious mission who did not drink and took his not drinking seriously . He knew how he was perceived and it was a kind of comfort for Burns to have the word to hold onto . <p> " Welcome to Alaska , " Julie said , handing him a glass of sparkling water . " There are no limes . " She touched his glass with her own . <p> " I 'd worry if there were . " <p> " You do n't drink , " she said , sipping her whiskey . " Smart man . " <p> " No . Alec , I 'm sure , told you . I got smart a little late . " He sucked on his lip and nodded at her . " I 've missed a lot . I 'm an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled and touched his glass again . " And it is a world of accidents , believe me . Someone just dropped the bread , right ? And or , the way home we 'll find the peanut butter . Lots of things get dropped . " She looked at his face appraisingly . " You 're still a smart man . " Julie waved a hand out over the room . " How do you like the Tahoe , the hub of culture on the frontier ? " <p> " It 's big . I spent a lot of time having stronger drinks in smaller places . " <p> " You 're a lawyer . " <p> " I am . I was a good lawyer years ago . Now I 'm simply highly paid : probate on the Gold Coast . Did Alec say he 'd forgiven me for it ? " <p> " Alec always spoke of you in the best terms . You taught him how to sail ? " <p> " One summer a long time ago . I was n't around much . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the room and two tablemates stood and lifted the person back into place . <p> " Will you stay here ? " Burns asked her . " In Kotzebue ? " <p> " I 'm a nurse . There 's a lot of call for that here . I 've got a life  --  and I 've got my students . " <p> The walk neck to the trailer again awakened in Burns a huge hunger . He had the same feeling he always had when he spoke of his past , honest and diminished , but now he mainly felt hungry . The wind was in their faces and they leaned against it , talking , while Burns felt the chocolate bar in his pocket . Julie spoke of first meeting his son their first year at Juilliard . " I was n't their kind of musician , " she said , punching the words into the wind . " I was lucky . I 'd been lucky with the competitions , really . And I did n't really care for all the work . It was nonstop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the teams were staked . Julie took his arm and turned into the narrow , icy lane where her trailer stood . " I like to play  --  I teach and I still play  --  but at Juilliard , well " - she faced him in the cold dark , her face luminous- " too many artist . " <p> Inside the trailer , Julie 's three students plucked at violin strings tuning their instruments . She introduced them to Burns : Tara , Mercy , and Calvin , native kids all about twelve . They sat serious and straight-backed in the living room for the lesson while Julie began leading them through the half-hour 's exercises . Calvin 's eyes kept going sideways to Burns , and Burns could see they were all self-conscious , so he stood and started for his room . Julie stopped and came to him . " Can I get you anything ? " <p> " No , thank you , " he said . Taking off his coat had made him impossibly tired . " I 'll see you in the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sliding harmonies of the four violins rise and fall . Alec had started the violin when he was six , the year Helen had taken him and gone back to Ohio , and years later when Alec finished Juilliard , he had gone to Alaska to teach . Burns had never contacted his son when he was studying in New York . In those days guilt had slowed everything Burns did . He had moved his practice to Connecticut by then , and three times Burns had taken the train into the city and walked by the music school , slowing enough to hear the strains of piano or French horn from a window . And then , as if scolded by the music , he hurried away . He could n't cross the street and go in . Now Burns cringed at his cowardice . <p> Under the heavy blankets in his room as the wind moaned over the trailer , Burns listened to the violins . He 'd eaten his chocolate and was tired to his bones . He could feel the structure moving in the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Later he had heard voices , their timbre , something almost angry , and then he felt the door shut , and the rushing quiet took him again . <p> Burns woke in the bright morning and heard the white wind . He was disappointed as he wiped at the frost on the inside of his window to see the storm outside , but there was something else : all this weather . He liked this odd place big on the earth and full of weather . He 'd had the same feeling on certain days sailing off St. John : the ocean could be a big , unknowable thing there , indifferent to anybody 's plans . <p> Julie had left him a map on the table , a pencil grid of the village with arrows to the sheriff 's office and his phone number . At the bottom it said , " I 'll be back at five  --  and then I better take you to the hospital party , so everyone can meet the mystery man . It 's at seven . J. " Beside it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mug of the cold powdered milk from the fridge . Standing there in his pajamas in the kitchen drinking the thick , cold milk , Burns grinned . He felt like a kid . He was grinning . Powdered milk was better than he had imagined . <p> Outside , marching sidelong into the killer wind , Burns felt the cold only in his exposed forehead and then not as cold , but as a constriction , a tight band of pain . He walked with his head turned for protection into his parka hood , and the drivers of the snow machines who roared past also drove with their heads turned . It made him stop and move aside several times . He saw several more mittens in the snow , but did n't pick them up . The day , the world , was all wind , even the rustle of his coat was lost in the gale . <p> The sheriffs office was two long blocks past the Tahoe in a small complex of state and federal buildings , one-story brick cottages linked by covered walkways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook hands , Burns had to sit down for a moment and rub his forehead while the aching subsided . He 'd sat behind his own desk just like this , rubbing his head , unable to talk to some client as a low wave of nausea rinsed through . In those days , while he tried to poison himself with it , drinking pernicious amounts of gin every night , his clients never knew , his business never quivered . When he went down , they did n't find him for a week , and when Helen came to the hospital , she simply said to stop it , that she was fine and would be , but that killing himself would make it worse for everyone . " You 've broken me , " she said . " I 'm taking the baby and going home . " And that was that . He was two weeks in the hospital , having almost lost toes to frostbite , and when he came out , he moved the office to New Canaan , dropped everything but probate , and knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drinking  --  that his life was over . Helen had already taken Alec back to Ohio , where her mother had lived , and a few years later she married Charley , an attorney in Chagrin Falls . <p> The sheriff 's name was Lloyd Right , a man all in khaki , whom Burns liked right away . " Mr. Burns , " he 'd said , taking Burns 's coat and pointing out the easy chair , " now tell me exactly the objectives of your visit to the frozen North . " <p> He nodded through the tale , his jaw in his fist , and then when Burns finished , Lloyd Right stood and went to the three-drawer file in the corner and pulled out a folder . " It does n't appear as if Glen Batton or anybody else is going to be able to lift you out there . " Right went back to his desk and sat down , placing the folder squarely in front of him . " This weather has been tight for a week , and it 's a pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand too well the importance of just being at the scene . " Right dialed the phone and then hung up . It rang and he picked up and said , " Jerry , bring us two coffees . " He looked at Burns . " You want some coffee , do n't you ? " <p> " I do . " <p> " Anyway , Julie told me about you and about Alec 's mother . These things are always bad . What I can do for your is tell you what I know , let you read the file . It was en accident , you can tell his mother that . We do n't have any photos . But Julie had been by his place and she can describe it to you . You could tell the family that you went out there , that- " <p> " No , I could n't , " Burns said . " I could n't do that . You understand . I am the family . I could tell Alec 's mother I was here and saw this file and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in with the coffee , setting the two mugs on the sheriffs desk , and backing out . While the office door was open , another officer came in , the cold on him like an odor , a rifle in his hand . " Lloyd , they 've seen the stray out at the foothills . You coming ? " <p> " Take Bob . Call me in half an hour , " Right said . When the men had left , the sheriff sipped his coffee . " We 've got one goddamned stray left , and he 's a smart one . What a lone dog can do to a staked team . You do n't want to see it . Some of our teams are worth thousands ; two teams are going down for the Iditarod next month . Do they hear about the Iditarod in Connecticut , Mr. Bums ? " <p> " They do , " Burns said . " You do n't think I can get out to Kolvik ? " <p> " I do n't . It 's too bad . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles from the village , south , in the low hills . The cabin had been totally consumed . " The sheriff stood and came around his metal desk , sitting on the edge of the short bookshelf near Bums . " You know , even before he left here , something had happened to Alec , " he said . " He had a breakdown or something . This is not in the report . But he began acting strange . You can ask Julie about it . We were sorry about it here . What he had done for the music program in the high school in two years was wonderful and when he dropped out and moved out there sixty miles , well , everybody felt bad . But we see this kind of thing here . A guy moves out and then farther out and moves , if he can , to what he sees as the end of the road , the edge , and either he lives there or he does n't , but he does n't come back . " <p> Lloyd Right went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with his fingers for a moment . He went on , " You figure it . He was a fine musician . So , he moves out to Kolvik and starts a trapline . It was just above the cabin in a draw . That 's where they found the body . It was a classic case of freezing to death , I mean , he 'd taken off his clothes and they were scattered around . It 's very common , Mr. Burns , and I would think it 's important that you know this was an accident , not suicide . He misjudged the time and was out too long . " Lloyd Right stood again and drained his coffee . " We found the dog out these with him Julie has her . " <p> On the way home , Burns felt his mouth dry with hunger and he went into the small Co-op and bought a bag of chocolate bars . Outside a man had fallen on the steps and Burns and a woman helped the man climb back up . Burns took the back street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathway . There were fewer close calls with snow machines here , and he ate the candy and walked slowly , his hands thrust deeply into his parka pockets . Then a strange thing happened that scared him so badly he involuntarily ducked and nearly fell . At first Burns thought something had nearly hit him , but then he saw the light change , a sunflash that settled on the village for a second , dropping thick blue shadows on the sides of things . It was painfully bright . The sun was out . In the sky Burns could see the contours of individual clouds . Stay there , he thought . Just stay there . <p> The party that night was held in the hospital recreation room , a small , square room lined with blue vinyl couches . The hospital was obviously an old wooden military building that had been superficially redone . There was a new checkerboard linoleum floor , but wooden framed windows lined each wall . Julie took Burns by the arm and introduced him to everybody in the room , thirty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lloyd Right and his wife ; both deputies ; several nurses and two doctors ( also both women ) ; Glen Batton ; the high school principal and his wife ; a dozen teachers there ; the school board members with whom Burns recognized from his flight ; a social counselor named Victor ( the only Inuit at the party ) ; some guys from the National Guard ; and part of the airport staff . Burns was n't very comfortable . He 'd slept all afternoon and his feet hurt and his face felt swollen . But he was keen , too , because the weather had changed  --  there was talk of a clearing . Jets were coming in from Nome tomorrow . <p> He stood by the buffet table and ate strips of the salty ham while he filled a small paper plate with deviled eggs . He felt a bit foolish , but he could not move away from the buffet table , eating handfuls of the chips and dip and mixed nuts , nodding at people with his mouth full , smiling , absolutely out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " So , you 're not a cop , " Burns just smiled at him , too , and shook his head , popping another of the tangy eggs into his mouth . <p> There was a slide show . One of the nurses had been in the Grand Canyon the past summer and showed slides of her river trip . They were good slides , not professional , but full of steep purple rock and shadow . Burns stood behind the couches during the presentation eating carrot sticks and drinking Seven-Up , and the Grand Canyon on the hospital wall , the foaming brown river , the two huge yellow rafts , and the travelers in their bikinis and sunglasses all gave him a kind of spin and he finally stopped eating and sat down . <p> " You 're from Connecticut , " a woman next to him said . It was Karen , the chief nurse . In the near dark he saw that she was about his age , a brunette with an aquiline nose , like ' a pretty schoolteacher . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide changed and everybody laughed : four naked people holding hands ran toward the river . <p> " Which one is you , Leslie ?

" <p> " Not twice a year . Usually just spring . A lot of dogs are let loose . It 's a bad deal . " <p> " Come here , " a man said from behind him , taking his arm . It was the counselor , the Inuit , Victor . " I 'll show you something . " He led Burns past Karen and down the hallway and out the side door into the cold . " Check this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finger of yellow light run up the sky and fade , followed by two pale pink ones that shifted like something seen through a depth of water . <p> " I 've never seen them before , " Burns said to the man . His breath rose as white mist . ' <p> The man smiled . " Alec had n't either , " he said " I 'm sorry for what happened . He was related to you ? " <p> " He was my son . " Now a greenish white washed up the sky and flared in sections as if cooling . <p> " He was too smart for this place , " the man said . <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " What would keep him here ? All the white guys with their dog teams ? Alec was a genius , right ? He must be what a genius is . " <p> " Possibly , " Burns said . The cold had gone through him now and become a pressure in his neck . Now the pink was back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're staying with Julie ? " <p> " Yes , " Burns answered , and alerted by something in Victor 's voice he added , " Why ? " <p> " Nothing , " Victor said , looking up , his hands thrust deep in his pockets . " I could never figure them . Alec and her . " <p> " I see , " Burns said . For a moment the sky was black . " She 's so . . . Burns opened the sentence hoping the other man would finish it . He wanted this information . <p> " I do n't know . I should n't talk . You 'll see that not much up here is what it seems , but they did n't ft . She 's too sociable . Maybe that 's what I mean . " <p> Suddenly a canopy of blue light came up the sky and then shredded and disappeared . <p> Someone took Burns 's arm and he felt a body next to him . " Are n't you freezing ? Karen said . She shivered against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's twenty below . " Burns put his arm out and around the woman . <p> " Do you know what happened to him ? " he said to Victor <p> " I do n't . I took him hunting once , his first year here , before he moved out . He was good people . I never saw somebody so swept away by this place . He loved it all . He was an intense guy all around . " <p> Karen shifted her position , running her arms around Burns 's middle and burying her head in his shoulder . " It 's cold ! " she said , laughing . The night continued to convulse above them , a huge panorama revolving across the horizon . The sharp , dry cold sized Burns 's skin , his face . The food and the slides were all gone . He was awake . <p> " What 's the weather tomorrow , Victor ? Could a person fly somewhere ? " <p> " We 'll get one day , " Victor said . " Tomorrow you could fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm , the cold now real in the warm room . Most of the people at the party were dancing , and Burns saw Glen Batton and Julie moving slowly to the music , another song he knew but could n't identify . He did n't know the name of five songs in the world . It was a wonder to him ; he did n't know any songs . <p> Karen asked him if he wanted to dance and he smiled and said he had to go . She led him back to the coats , which were in the dark entry hall . She handed him his parka , and the way she looked at him  --  frankly without any real pity  --  led him to do something he had n't done in ten years . He leaned to her and put his free hand around her back and kissed her . She embraced him fully , but without anything frantic , and the dark of the hall and the smell of the coats made him feel like a boy again and now , too , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting her against him . He liked feeling her body and she shifted twice against him , moving so their legs were interwoven and he heard her moan in the shifting coats , and he did not let go . Then he heard his name . Glen was saying his name . <p> " Excuse me , " Glen said , coming down the dark hallway . They had disengaged by the time he spoke again . " Julie asked me to tell you that I 'm willing to take you out to Kolvik tomorrow . " Glen was looking at Karen . " The weather 's supposed to clear . " <p> " I appreciate that , " Burns said . " Are you sure ? " <p> " No problem , " Glen said . <p> " The weather is going to be splendid . " Julie had come up behind him . She saw Burns putting on his coat . " Where are you going ? " <p> " I thought I 'd get some rest . Deviled eggs , the Grand Canyon , the Northern Lights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " He 'd never seen the lights before , " Karen said , squeezing Burns 's arm . <p> " Here , " Julie said , taking his arm from Karen . " I 'll go with you . " <p> " No , please . " he said , putting on his coat . " I know the way . Please . Stay . " Burns could feel Glen Batton 's eyes on him . <p> Julie retrieved her coat and pushed Glen back to the party . Karen stood around until she saw that Julie was serious about leaving , and then she took both of Burns 's hands and reached up and kissed him quickly , drifting back to the party herself . As he opened the door for Julie and pushed out into the white night , Burns saw Batton watching them . <p> The night was now still , the first stillness Burns had felt in Alaska , and he felt the weight of the profound chill , - the northern sky fringed with erratic blooming light . " Her husband rap the armory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading freight two years ago . " <p> " She stayed . " <p> Julie looked at him . " People stay , " she said . " You come out , you do n't go back . " Julie held his arm all along the crunching , snowy road and they did n't speak further , but fell into step like the oldest of friends , and Burns let the night and the cold disappear and he imagined that she was thinking what he was thinking : that tomorrow he would see where Alec died . <p> At Julie 's trailer , the lights were on and two little boys sat at the kitchen table in their stocking feet , drawing with crayons . " Well , hello , Timmo , " Julie said . " How are you ? " Neither boy looked up , but Burns could see their eyes looking around . " Is this your cousin ? " <p> Timmo nodded . <p> " Well , good . What 's he drawing ? " The cousin fumed his paper a bit so Julie could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two brown smudges . The boy traced a line from one to the other . " This is you shooting a caribou , is n't it ? " Julie said . " And it is very good . " The boys smiled to each other . Julie opened the cupboard and put out a plate of Graham crackers and poured two glasses of milk . " Now , Timmo , " she said , looking at her watch . " At eleven , you must go home . " She looked up at Burns . " This is Timmo and his cousin No Name . " At this the boys giggled . " Timmo is an artist who comes over some nights . His mother is in the Tahoe . " Burns stood there in his coat . He wanted one of the crackers . He wanted them all . He smiled at the beautiful native boys . What a day . He had been warm and cold and hungry . This was all so new . <p> Julie took her coat off and came over to him . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got a big day ahead , and if we do n't leave the room , they 'll never eat the crackers . " Burns found her voice a sensuous comfort . <p> The next afternoon , in the low white angle of sunlight , Burns walked out to Glen Batton 's place , a trailer behind the Forest Service buildings . The light was terrific , knifing at Burns , and he squinted behind his sunglasses . <p> In the small yard , he slipped and fell , and climbing awkwardly back up , Burns saw that he had stumbled across the hindquarters of a caribou lying in the snow . " That 's the freezer up here , " Glen Batton said from the doorway . " Fresh meat all winter . Hop m the truck , I 'll be right there . " <p> Batton seemed in a good mood , quite happy to show Burns all he knew about the small airplane , which was tethered  --  along with a dozen others  --  out on the frozen sea . A runway had been freshly bladed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all the preparations he made , taking off the heavy insulated blanket over the motor , checking the oil , freeing the flaps . He had Burns help him push the plane forward a foot , cracking the icy seal between the skis and the snowpack . He opened the passenger door and pointed out the emergency gear under the seat , the food , the cross-country skis , and then he pointed to a small orange box in the back of the small cargo space and said , " Do n't worry about that , Mr. Burns . That will start signaling on impact . " <p> And Glen was chatty on the way over to Kolvik , talking to Burns  --  over the intercom  --  about his work with the Forest Service . They flew up the river in the sunshine , Batton pointing out the moose and caribou . He explained that for the caribou counts he usually took one of the secretaries and that Julie did n't like that . " Did you ever get in spats with your wife , Mr. Burns ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's jealous over something you 're doing , although you 're totally innocent . " <p> " I guess , sometimes , " Burns said , his voice distant on the intercom , sounding small like what it was : a lie . Helen had never fought with him , never complained . She had been a sweet , happy , confident woman who had  --  even in their extremity  --  never fought with him . <p> " Yeah , well , Julie . . . " Batton said . " That 's why she left last night and went home early with you . " Batton pointed ahead where a small herd of caribou moved across the frozen river . " What am I going to do , land out there and screw Denise ? " <p> A haze had come up , like bright smoke , and the plane rippled across the changing sky . Burns was concentrating , trying to see the country as Alec might have seen it . <p> " We take a lunch and stop for lunch , " Glen Batton went on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right ? " <p> The rest of the flight was different from what Burns could have foreseen . He could n't get Glen to put down in Kolvik . They came upon the small toss of cabins which was Kolvik , and Burns 's heart lifted , but then it all changed quickly . There was no strip near the small village , of course , and Glen explained that it was n't safe to land in the snow so soon after the recent storms . He made one pass by the clearing near where Alec 's cabin had been and laid down a pair of tracks with the skis , but then circling he explained to Burns  --  through the noisy intercom  --  that it was too soft , too dangerous . Shoulder to shoulder with Glen Batton in the front seat of the smallest plane he 'd ever been in , Burns asked again if they could n't possibly try to land . <p> " No can do , Mr. Burns , " Batton said , his voice tiny through the receiver , sounding miles away . " Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out either . That 's where he lived . " The pilot dipped the passenger wing steeply and pointed . " Below that hill . " There was no sign of anything in the perfect snow . They made one more broad circle over the area , seeing several moose in the valley where Alec supposedly had trapped ' and then they headed west toward home . Burns felt the little plane rattle in the new head wind , the door flexing against his knee more than it had for the flight out , and he felt a disappointment that replaced hunger in his gut . He 'd been so close . He could have jumped from the plane and landed in the drift . From the air , the place where his son lived had looked like all the other terrain they 'd seen : snowy hills grown with small pine . Alaska gave up its stories hard . He 'd learned nothing . <p> They had flown quite low on the way out , but now Glen was taking the plane up to three and then four thousand feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick roseate mist . Burns was silent , mad at first , feeling cheated , and then resolved simply on what he now knew : he would ask Blazo . <p> " You spoke to the sheriff , " Batton said . <p> " I did . " Even Burns 's own voice sounded remote on the intercom . " He was a help . " <p> " And now you 've been to Kolvik . " <p> " Not quite , Glen . I 've flown over it . " <p> Batton ignored him , resetting some instruments , finally saying , " Did you ever see Russia ? " <p> " I never have . " <p> Batton leveled the plane at five thousand feet and fumed it slightly , aquinting through the windshield . " You know it 's funny your being here . I would n't have walked across the street for my old man and here you 've come all the way north to see where your kid died . " Burns said nothing . " There . " Glen Batton pointed at a faint solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Russia . " <p> Burns could see the landfall that Batton had indicated , dark and vague beneath the fading rosy dusk , and as the little aircraft was bumped and lifted , he could sense the curvature of the earth from this height . Flying into the lost light made him feel again the sorrow he 'd lived by for so long . The little plane descended in rocky strokes , lurching and gliding through the darkening , frigid night . The men did not speak , but when the lights of Kotzebue glimmered on the horizon , a settlement in the void , Glen Batton spoke to the airport and then said to Burns : " Look . I know he was your son and he was a good kid , but the end was no good . He was a pain in the ass for everybody . Nearly drove Julie crazy . " <p> Burns just listened . He was n't mad anymore . He did n't want to argue . The lights of the village grew distinct and Batton circled out over the frozen ocean showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pools of lamplight on the snow-packed streets . <p> " And now you 're here , starting it all up again . You ought to get the flight to Anchorage tomorrow before this next weather really hits , and let Julie get on with her life . " <p> Burns could see an orange bonfire on the hill at the edge of town and the dark forms of sleds descending the slope . Batton banked sharply , moving for the first time all day with an undue haste , and then leveled , and as the icy runway approached , Burns felt the bottom drop out . The plane dipped suddenly , wrenching him up against his seat belt , where he floated for a second before slamming down . His head hit the windscreen and the edge of the console and then he felt the plane riding hard on the ridged ice , shaking him to the spine . <p> Batton ran the plane to the end of the runway and then wheeled it around to the tie-downs . " Sorry about that , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit her pretty hard that time . " <p> Burns 's hand was in the blood on his hairline and he could feel the welt rising where his forehead was split . <p> " You O.K. ? " Batton asked , fuming off the plane and climbing down . <p> " What 'd you do to him , Glen ? What did you do to Alec ? " <p> With the earphones off , everything sounded flat . Batton was fastening the fixed cables to each wing . Burns opened his door and jumped down onto the ice and moved away from the plane . He was dizzy and there seemed to be blood everywhere . Head cuts were like faucets ; he 'd had plenty playing hockey . <p> Batton was struggling with the insulation blanket for the engine . " You bleeding ? " he said . " Let me see that . " <p> " Were you after Julie before Alec moved ? " Burns said . <p> Batton stopped fastening the snaps on the cover and came around to Burns . It was clear he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pickup on the rough sea ice . " Look , " Batton said , " you 're a smart guy . Julie said you went to Yale . " <p> " Glen , " Burns said . " I did n't come up here for trouble . I came up here to see what Alec saw , something for myself . And now I want to know what you did to him . " <p> Glen came up to Burns and took a handful of his parka shoulder . In the icy light , Burns could see his face , angry and tight , and he felt himself being lifted . He did n't care . He was bleeding . He did n't care what Glen did . Burns saw Batton 's eyes flicker over the things he was going to do and then focus on him . " Get in , " Glen said finally , letting go of the coat . But Burns backed past the truck and into the dark toward the mounds of ragged plate ice between himself and the village . <p> Not ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , disoriented and full of the old dread . He 'd just walked and something  --  the cold , the gash on his head , the iron hardness of the packed roadway , the glimpse of the earth growing dark  --  had let it all gather in his heart . For years he had thought that the weight of it , the darkest part , was his drinking . He 'd wake somewhere sick and feel it around his chest like a cold hand and not be able to swallow . But after he stopped drinking , it did n't lift . It did n't come every day , but when it came as it had tonight , it hit with a force that left him weak . <p> On their holidays when he and Helen would go to St. John , he was drunk by noon usually , rum was such an easy thing to drink . You could drink it in anything , coffee , juice . You could drink it in milk , for chrissake . You could take warm mouthfuls right from the bottle . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , but not in balmy weather . In the islands it was rum . Manhattan was gin . Airplanes were gin , too , the stiff chemical push in the face . Clients were scotch , something that bit and then slid in . Burns , he could drink scotch for weeks . He had done it . But his rules were his rules : Manhattan was gin ; St. John was rum ; clients were scotch ; and he drank vodka and bourbon those nights when the rules began to float . It was vodka the time he tried to die . <p> Now Burns felt the goose egg on his forehead . The blood had stopped , but the flesh was too tender to touch . He looked around and could n't find a landmark . Four or five buildings , warehouses or churches , stood over him . He was n't sure of the way he 'd come and he could n't tell north from south . He felt drained . He turned around searching for a clue , even a snowbank to sit on , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own life he had missed . <p> Between buildings he thought he caught sight of the bonfire on the hill , when someone took his arm . He looked down at Blazo , his grin showing the missing teeth , a man who by the wrinkles in his brown face could have been a hundred . Blazo kept his firm grip on Burns 's arm and marched him to the corner , out of the shadows , and pointed at the sledding fire . <p> " I saw them sledding , " Burns said , but Blazo pointed again . A flare of powdery red light rose in the sky and then dissolved as a wave of yellow swelled and faded . " This place , " Burns said . He felt dizzy . " These nights . This place is something else . " He stepped away from Blazo . " Thanks , " he said . " Julie 's place is that way , right ? " <p> Blazo nodded . He seemed to be examining Burns 's face . <p> Burns started down the street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon . I need to see where Alec Burns lived , where he had a trapline . South of town . " <p> " He was your boy , " Blazo said . <p> Above them , the sky was relentless , the random , vast armatures of colored light wheeling up and then vanishing , sometimes printing themselves from nothing on the darkness like bright stains . " He was , " Burns whispered . The cold air cut at Burns 's nose as he breathed and he could feel his pulse aching in his wound . " You can talk , " Burns said . <p> " Not really . " Blazo quickly pointed down the snow-packed lane , and Burns saw a figure trotting swiftly under the lamplight , a dog , some kind of husky , moving as with purpose . " But we 'll go out there , " Blazo said . " Tomorrow morning . It 's going to snow , but we 'll get half a day of good weather . " <p> The trailer was dark . Burns opened the door quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violin and felt the warmth and it made him catch his breath . He almost wept . <p> Burns passed through the mud room without removing his coat and felt Molly 's nose fit into his palm in the dark . His legs were trembling . Julie was playing something sharp , full of energy and angles , it filled the space completely , and Burns saw her as he passed through the living room . She sat on the ottoman in her underwear playing by the light of two candles . He saw the shine of sweat on her forehead and breastbone , and then he was in his room , suddenly warm himself and pulling at his coat and sweater . <p> There was a knock at his door , and Julie entered tying her robe . " Hi , " she said . " Sorry about that . . . what 's all this blood ? " <p> " Nothing , " he said . He was sitting on the bed . " You play very well . " <p> Julie took his chin in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes , it 's nothing , " she said . " Looks like Glen hit you with an axe . " <p> " It was an accident , " Burns said quietly . On the warm bed with his head in a woman 's hands he felt himself letting go . Julie was standing very close . He was a serious and controlled man , and he clenched his jaw , but his eyes welled . <p> " I 'm going to have to stitch this closed , Mr. Tom Burns , or you 'll return to the East Coast with a genuine Alaskan tattoo . " And in a moment she returned with a warm wet cloth and a small kit . " You want something to eat ? " <p> " No , " he said . " I 'm all in . " He could feel his voice unsteady . " We did n't make it . Glen could n't land . " <p> Burns leaned back and looked at Julie and he saw her read his face . She stood beside him and put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are you doing in Alaska ? I 'm not so sure this is a good idea for you . " She began dabbing at his forehead with the cloth . <p> Then Burns 's head began to ache and he could feel her working at the skin with the black thread . He was pulled into the open front of her robe where freckles rose from her cleavage in warm , vertiginous constellations inches from his face , and he could smell her skin and the sweet Wild Turkey on her breath . His right ear was full of dried blood and his hearing came and went . He had both of his hands on her hips and he could feel her moving against him , the warmth and pressure of her legs . <p> " Are you all right ? " Burns whispered . <p> He heard her say , " I know what I 'm doing . " <p> He had a high hollow feeling and his mouth tasted sweet and dry the way it did before a drunk , and Julie cinched each stitch with three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shifting breasts , the freckles riding there , his eyes half-closed in the warm room , and the steady and expected tug-tug-tug . He ran his hand inside her robe and lifted his face to kiss her . She kissed him back , pausing for a moment to move the dangling needle on its black thread out of their way . She came over onto him on the bed . " Is n't this why you 've come ? " Her eyes fixed him as she continued to move with each word : " Is n't it ? " Burns could feel the needle riding in his ear now and Julie lifted it away . " Watch out for me . I 'm not what you think . " <p> " What do I think ? " <p> " You think I 'm some coping person . A nurse . Something . I do n't even know anymore what they do in your world , but here we take comfort where we find it . Glen came after me like a dog in heat . It 's like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could feel that he was aroused . " I 'm like that . " <p> " No you 're not , " he said . Even as he heard the words , he realized he did n't know what he was saying . He 'd decided who she was yesterday , standing in her kitchen . The whole journey to Alaska had seemed mad to him at first , but once he was committed , he 'd decided what he would see . He had written a kind of scenario without knowing it and now it was coming undone . It was a long moment for Burns , as if he had dived into the ocean and was waiting to turn and ascend . He was airless and without will . <p> Julie had lifted herself and was looking into his eyes , waiting for something . She looked much older here , harder . When he did n't move , she said , " You really do n't get it , do you ? " <p> " What ? What is it ? " he said to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " You 're hard to believe , Tom , " Julie said , rolling off him and standing by the bed . " You 're too old to be that innocent . " She took his head in her hands once again , but she held it differently . " Yes , Glen hurt Alec . So did I. So did this place . And probably you did , too . Alec went mad . He did . But when he moved out there , Glen did n't help him . I know that . They hated each other by then , you can tell that . He would n't take me out and he never dropped supplies . I knew he would n't land with you . I 'm trying to be honest here . What happened would have happened . Glen did n't kill Alec . " <p> " He did n't save him . " <p> " That 's what I 'm telling you , Tom . " Julie stood back , tugging sharply at the thread in Burns 's forehead , and she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Burns was walking in the snow . So this is where it was , he thought . He tried to see the valley as Alec might have , and began picking his way across the meadow . The surface of the snow was crusted , and he was n't cutting deeper than a few inches with each step . He worked into a warm rhythm of small steps up the incline , breathing into the gray afternoon . It was wonderful to move this way after being on the snow machine all day . The clouds had come down , and Burns felt the air change as he marched . It lifted at him somehow , not a wind , but some quickness that was sharper in his nose , and it grew darker suddenly and he saw the first petals of the quiet snow easing down around him . <p> At the top he fumed , breathing hard , and put his hand on his hips to rest . Burns felt the old high thrill in his chest just like the winter days at Yale , the flasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at midnight wired tight with alcohol , his coat open to the sharp tonic of the air . Now his head was almost against the somber tent of clouds and below him the snow fell as it does at sea , ponderous and invisible at once , disappearing except where it fell on his sleeves , his eyebrows . The snow was falling everywhere . <p> Burns continued . His knees burned faintly as he stepped along the crest of the hill and descended into the draw where Alec had trapped . Here the small pines were thicker and there were game trails in the snow between the clumps of trees . <p> The year he quit drinking , that June , he and Alec had sailed from Martha 's Vineyard to the Elizabeth Islands on an afternoon as perfect as this . The blue sky everywhere and the sea green and swollen for their trip . It had been like this , like this soft kicking through snow , their rolling and cutting through the swells , and an exhilaration set in that Burns remembered keenly . Alec had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands and swum the hundred yards to shore and then lain on the deserted sand , laughing and panting , and the boy had said to him , " This is it , Dad . This is the best day of my life . " Burns thought at that time : I am as close to being happy as I will ever be . And he did feel happy , proud to be a good sailing coach and pleased to have captured the Elizabeth Islands on the most beautiful day in the year , but the other thing was always with him . He did n't say it before they stood and began to swim back , but Burns had decided that day to live . It would n't be flying , he knew , but he would live . <p> Halfway up the draw , Burns stopped . This was it . He fell back in the snow , flinging out his arms He lay there and let his heart pound him deeper . He could hear it crashing in his ears . The pin-dots of snow burned across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right about Alaska : it was too warm Burns closed his eyes . This was where Alec died . When he opened them , he stared up into the falling snow until he felt the lift of vertigo . The roaring silence was nicked by a new sound now , the snow machine buzzing closer and then  --  as he felt the snow fix and himself rise into the sky , weightless , a face appeared above his head . <p> " Right , " he said to Blazo . " I 'm coming . One more minute . " He caught Blazo 's look and added , " Do n't worry . I 'll get up . " <p> " You and me , " Blazo said . " We 've been gone a long time already . " Blazo 's face disappeared , and Burns felt himself again sink into the snow . It was pleasant here , lonely and floating , and Burns stopped trying to sort his thoughts . He was hungry , and pleased to be hungry again . He could feel his feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . He thought , The world has got a hold of me again . He drew a breath , the air aching in his chest , and he said , " Alec . " His voice sounded sure of something . " I 've been in the snow here , Alec , " he said into the sky . " I laid on my back in the snow . " <p> <p> By Ron Carlson <p>
