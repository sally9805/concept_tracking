CHINESE TROOPS LAUNCHING missiles that splash down perilously close to Taiwan and put its armed forces on high alert . A U.S carrier task force cruising the area , another sailing toward it . Washington assessing whether  --  and how  --  it might have to help Taiwan should the island be attacked by China . These are the most serious signals to date about the state of relations between the world 's sole remaining superpower and its sole up-and-coming superpower . One misstep and one misperception after another in recent years have bumped the U.S. and China closer to crisis . The latest rupture has been triggered by China 's harsh warning to Taiwan , underlined by war games offshore , that it must remain committed to eventual reunification and squelch whatever dreams of independence it might be harboring . True , what is happening off Taiwan is pantomime rather than confrontation : eager to avoid a clash , both sides are merely using their military to lend muscle to political messages . But to date neither Washington nor Beijing has given much indication that it knows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday give way to the real thing . <P> Over the next decade  --  or two or three  --  China will be at the top rung of American foreign-policy challenges . As a rising nation , like others before it , China is demanding respect in proportion to its strength . That would be reason enough for increased concern in the U.S.  --  and Asian countries  --  but Washington has a wider range of interests at stake where China is concerned . <P> Foremost is trade . The U.S. and China , a huge and largely untapped market of 1.2 billion people , now do $50 billion worth of business with each other . Beyond that , the enormous amount of U.S. commerce with Asia as a whole gives Washington even more reason to discourage China from intimidating its neighbors , to say nothing of starting a war . China poses a particular security worry because it has atomic weapons and has sent nuclear technology to other countries . Finally , the U.S. has both a moral and a realpolitik interest in seeing China improve its human-rights record . Encouraging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfies America 's sense of mission in the world but , if successful , would make China more stable . <P> China is not Haiti or Bosnia , places where America 's involvement may be desirable but is ultimately optional . China is not optional . A half-century after World War II , the U.S. remains the dominant power in the Pacific , and to the degree that it tries to maintain influence there , it will inevitably knock up against China 's rising importance . The peace and prosperity of the world in the next century depend in many ways on what Beijing does . How should the U.S. handle it ? There are essentially two prescriptions : a policy called comprehensive engagement , and one that goes under the old cold-war name , containment .
