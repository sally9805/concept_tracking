Although we 're a few months away from the weekend when our clocks spring ahead one hour , it 's not too early to think about such matters . Time , after all , does not stand still . The prolific lan Watson certainly does n't stand still , either . The most recent of his many books include Oracle , Hard Questions , and The Books of Mana . <p> TONY WOKE WITH SUCH A start . Light from the full moon flooded through the window of his bedroom at the side of the bungalow . Moonlight clearly lit the Donald Duck clock on the wall . The clock hung higher than Tony could reach , unless he stood on a chair . Little hand between three and four . Big hand at the bottom . Half-past three . Panic seized him . He jerked up his left wrist . On his new Aladdin watch the big hand was at the bottom but the little hand pointed between two and three . It was half-past two by his wristwatch . Despite Daddy 's promise , despite Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Daddy must have tiptoed around the house at two ay-em . He had come in here , but he had n't wakened Tony . Aunt jean , who always wore Jeans , had given Tony the watch the day before for his fifth birthday . He was Big Five . Soon he 'd be starting real school . Pride was one reason why he kept the watch on when he went to bed . But mainly , if he took it off , he might forget exactly where it was when the time came to change all the clocks . At the birthday party he had gone round showing the wristwatch to Tim and Michael and Sarah and the others just a bit too much , until Sarah and Tim had thrust their own presents at him a second time , as if he had n't liked those enough : the toy police car , the bendy dinosaur ... Home was n't big enough to hold a party in . In the wooden comm-unity hall along the road there 'd been balloons and cakes and musical chairs and pass-the-parcel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so tired . He 'd asked for his curtains to stay open . Mummy said the moon would keep him awake later on . Maybe she thought he was scared of the dark . Oh no . He had n't wanted Daddy to need to switch on the light at two , and dazzle him . Because the curtains were open , before he fell asleep Tony had seen the real police car cruise slowly past . It had stopped by the high wall of the huge house along the road where children lived who were odd because they did n't have Mummies and Daddies . From the bottom of the bed , Big Bear and Little Bear stared at Tony now with glittery eyes . The birds had n't started their chorus yet . It was so quiet . Tony squirmed along the duvet toward the bears . Pressing himself right up against the window , he stared at his Aladdin watch again . It was half-past two for Tony . It was half-past three for Daddy and Mummy and the rest of the world . The top bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm earlier this year than usual . He heard a voice calling softly , " Hey there ! " When Mummies and Daddies came to collect their children from the party , they stood around for a while drinking glasses of wine . " This is the night , is n't it ? It is forward , not back - ? " " Do we lose an hour or do we gain - ? " " Look : when it 's two o'clock it becomes three o'clock . We 're an hour ahead of where we were . So it stays dark longer in the morning - " " Seven o'clock is really six o'clock - " Wine could make grown-ups silly . They seemed to be getting heated up about nonsense , but this was important to Tony in view of his new Aladdin watch . During the magic show Aunt Jean had been sipping wine at the back of the hall with Mummy and Daddy . Now she was sitting on her own . So Tony asked her about this business of " changing the clocks . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can follow this ! Grown-ups get flummoxed enough . Foreigners must think we 're crazy , unless the same thing happens in their own countries . Well , in our country twice a year the time changes . Spring forward , Fall back : that 's how you remember . Fall 's another name for Autumn , you see . " No , he did n't see . " Because in the Autumn all the leaves fall off the trees . That 's when time goes back an hour . The original idea was to make the world lighter on winter mornings . But now it 's Spring , so tonight the time goes forward again to what it ought to be anyway . So all the clocks have to change . " Who could possibly change all the clocks in the world ? Did they change themselves ? Aunt Jean took another swallow of red wine . " People change their own clocks , Tony . " He brandished the watch she had given him . " You have to change it yourself . " She giggled . " Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . " When everybody was asleep in bed ? People must get up specially . But his Aladdin watch did n't have a " larm-like those watches which would go beep-beep . " It does n't have a " larm ! " he protested . Aunt Jean seemed annoyed . " Well , I 'm sure I 'm very sorry about that ! " Back home , the man on the TV said how everyone should put their clocks forward at two in the morning ; so this must be really important . You had to put your own forward . Had to do it yourself . Tony was Big Five now . He asked Daddy to promise to wake him up at two , cos there was no " larm on his watch . " You ought n't to have said that to Aunt Jean , " Mummy told him quite sternly . " As though you were n't satisfied ! You hurt her feelings . " Daddy made a never-mind face at Mummy . " It 's his birthday , after all- " " Huh , at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's forget it , hmm ? Tiring day . I 'll wake him up at two . " And Daddy had winked at Mummy . " What happens , " asked Tony , " if you do n't put the clock forward ? " " In that case , " Mummy said sharply , " you get left behind . " He 'd been left behind . Cos they thought he 'd been rude to Aunt Jean ; but he had n't been ! A little girl was standing in the garden by the big rose bush , out of sight of the street . She was waving to him . She must have been left behind too ! The big window was kept locked for safety when the house was empty and at night , but Mummy had showed him how to unlock it in case there was ever a fire . As he pushed the window open the girl came closer . She was skinny , with untidy short brown hair . Her dress was printed with gray flowers which might have been any color during the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin ankles poked into trainers fastened tightly by those cling-together straps . " The clocks have changed , " Tony told her , and showed his Aladdin watch . " I 've been left behind ! " For a moment he thought she was going to laugh at him , but then she replied firmly , " You are n't the only one . " " Daddy promised to wake me but he left me sleeping when he changed the clock . " " You wo n't be able to wake your Daddy now , " she said with absolute certainty . " You ca n't wake a Daddy or a Mummy or anyone . They 're all in a different hour . They 're in their own world . " She seemed to know all about this . Of course she must , if she was here and able to talk to him . What had she done that was wrong ? " They would n't be able to see you ! " she hissed . Tim had told Tony about a movie . Tim 's baby-sitter and her boyfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be in bed upstairs . Tim 's home was bigger than Tony 's ; it had two floors . Tim had crept downstairs . The door to the sitting room was ajar . He had watched through the gap . Once upon a time in a big old house a little girl had died horribly . A man and woman moved in , who did n't know about the girl . They already had two young sons but they wanted a girl as well . Soon somebody whom no one could see was using the toilet . Somebody was taking snacks and milk from the fridge . Somebody was knocking things over and breaking them . At first the parents thought their own boys were to blame - but then an awful accident happened to one of the boys , which could n't possibly have been his fault . The grown-ups called for a priest to come and throw water around the rooms and pray and exercise the house ... That 's how it would be here at home . Tony would use the toilet and he 'd get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him because he was an hour behind . " What can I do ? " he asked the girl . " Do what I say , " she said . " I know what to do . We have to go somewhere special . " She pointed up at the full moon . " That 's a face up there . " " It 's the Man in the Moon . " She stamped her foot angrily . " No , it is n't . It 's a face all right , but it 's the face of a clock . Only , you ca n't see the hands till you go to a special place . You have to see the hands move on the Moon . Then you can come back home , and it 'll be all right . " Tony gazed at the bright blotchy Moon . It was as round as a clock tonight , a luminous clock . " What if I just wind my watch forward now ? " " Too late , " she sang out , " too late ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Moon ? " People have been to the Moon , " she said . " I know that ! " " That was to see about fitting new hands on it . The old hands are invisible cept to people who get left behind - and from special places . The spacemen stuck a spike in the Moon for the new hands . Soon it 'll be a clock everyone can see , " cept if it 's cloudy . " " You ca n't see all of it all the time - " " They 'll light it properly . You 're wasting time ! I wo n't show you the place if you do n't come now . " Tony pulled on his clothes and shoes and he climbed onto the hard windowframe , which hurt his knees , and dropped himself down on to the path . The girl was taller than Tony by a head or more . Maybe she was seven . Or eight . " What 's your name ? " he asked . " People call me Mar-gar-et . " She spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I 'm not a Mar-gar-et . I 'm Midge . " A small garden hugged the bungalow . At the back of the garden was a fence . One of the planks had rotted and shifted aside . The girl already seemed to know about that . A grown-up could n't get through the fence , but Tony could , even if it meant scraping clothes ; and Midge was so skinny . Behind the fence was a waste place - and beyond was a forest of Christmas trees in rows , with lanes which went on and on . As Midge went with Tony into the forest , she asked , " What 's your name , anyway ? " " It 's Tony - I thought you knew about me ! " She caught hold of his hand , the one with the watch . Her own hand was sticky and strong . " I know all about you ! You had a birthday party . Balloons and Mummies and Daddies . " She must have peeped through the window of the comm-unity hall . She must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying his presents . He tried to pull away , but she tugged him along with her into the forest . " You have to come with me and see the hands of the Moon ! " Because of the Moon it was bright enough to see all the silvery branches . " I want to go home , " he begged . " You ca n't go back yet . You 'd still be too early . An hour too early . " " I 'd have asked you to the party if I 'd known you , Midge ! " She laughed . And he began to cry . With her free hand she slapped him on the cheek . " Cry-baby , " she mocked . " It 's horrid being lost , Tony . Never being seen . Never being heard . " Cept by my friends who can see the hands of the Moon . " Did she really want him as her friend ? " Where 's the place ? " he sniveled . " It 's at the far end of the forest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? She would n't slap him again ? He let her lead him along , though really he could n't have stopped her from dragging him . After a while she said , " You 'll have your time back-but I sha n't . Not till the Moon grins wide and spits me out like it grinned and swallowed me once , and my friends . " " You said the Moon was n't a man with a face , you said it was a clock ! " " Mainly it 's a clock . Mainly ! " Tony was terrified . Who were these friends who were waiting at the far end of the forest ? THE PAIR OF THEM CAME to a clearing . All around it , the boughs of the Christmas trees jutted like hundreds of barbed spears . The Moon glared down . Tony should easily have been able to see other children waiting , but he could n't . Midge 's friends must be hiding behind tree trunks . She sat down on soft nice-smelling needles , pulling him with her . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , " she chanted . " Gape at the Moon . Keep your eyes open . Do n't close them . Do n't look anywhere else or I 'll have to hit you . " Tony stared up . His ears were alert for any rustle of feet creeping closer , but the pine needles would deaden the noise . The Moon began to blind him to anything else . Soon there was just that bright blotchy flat disc . " It 's horrid being lost , Tony- " Desperately he tried to see hands on the Moon . Gaze as he might , he could n't . Gradually , out of the corners of his eyes , he became sure that other children were indeed sitting around in the clearing , clasping their drawnup knees and staring at him . He did n't dare look to make sure . " The Moon 's made of stone , " came Midge 's voice , " and so am I. Hard stone . " Did she have a stone in her hand ? Was she was going to hit him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock . A moon-dial ... " His eyes were watering with effort . Of course he blinked now and then . " Please , Midge , " he begged , but no reply came . Gray light began to dawn . A hundred birds started singing . The Moon was fainter now , a sickly yellow . When it sank slowly behind the top branches of a Christmas tree at last he saw the dark pointers upon the Moon 's face - and he cried out , " Yes , yes , I can see them ! " Midge was n't there anymore . She 'd gone . He had n't heard her leave because of the birds . Nor were there any other children in the clearing . He was alone . His legs had cramped . He staggered but soon he was running . Only when he had climbed back into his bedroom , and the Donald Duck clock caught his eye , did he think to look at his wristwatch . Little hand near five . Big hand at nine . It was quarter to five - by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mummy came in to wake him , but he was already awake . He 'd been fretting whether she would come , or whether he 'd have to go to the kitchen on his own - and would they be surprised to see him ? Had they been trying to lose him ? " I 'm sorry ! " he told her . Mummy looked suspicious . " What about ? " " Cos I was rude to Aunt Jean . " " Oh ... I thought you 'd broken something . " He pointed at the clock . " Daddy did n't wake me at two . " " You were dead to the world , but your Daddy thought you 'd want to see the right time in the morning - " Oh yes . To see the right time was everything . She realized what he had said . " At two ? Did you think we 'd sit up till two ? " With the summer term Tony started real school . The school bus took him there and brought him back . Different Mummies would ride on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Mummies , so that they could talk to each other . One hot day , men were busy tearing up the road near the huge house with the wall all around . A red light halted the bus , and Tony saw Midge on the pavement . She was standing stiffly beside a big woman who wore a blue suit . Those flowers on Midge 's dress were pink roses . Tony rapped his knuckles on the glass , then he slapped his flat palm , which made more noise . The woman in blue had noticed Tony and was frowning . Midge only stared emptily in the same direction as ever . He slapped harder . " Stop that , " he heard a Mummy call out . " Stop it right now ! Do n't make fun . " The other Mummy said to her friend , " That 's the girl that runs away . Though she 's supposed to be severely , " and she said a big word . Back home , Tony asked his Mummy , " What 's or-tis-tic mean ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're good at painting and playing music and things like that . Did a teacher say that about you today ? " Tony shook his head . He must n't have heard right in the bus . Anyway , Midge had n't said anything to him about paint or music . He remembered how blank her look had been , as if her face was a stone .
