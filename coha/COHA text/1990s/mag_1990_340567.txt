As the marketing monster called Earth Day lumbers toward April 22 , hapless journalists in its path are desperately dodging a barrage of press kits , news ( releases and alerts . Thousands of Earth Day happenings , from ladybug releases and the building of garbage monuments to corporate " We love the environment too " advertising campaigns , have become an undifferentiated blur as everyone tries to wave the green flag at once . Nobody is against Earth Day , but the very breadth of this looming mega-event raises the question : What 's the point ? <P> Certainly demonstrations and mass events have an honored role in history . Sheer , chanting force of numbers has served notice to dictators from Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines to Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania that their time was up . Back in 1970 , activists capitalized on an outpouring of environmental sentiment during the first Earth Day to unseat seven of a targeted " dirty dozen " politicians and spur the passage of clean-air-and-water legislation . Today Eastern Europe , perhaps the grimiest industrial region on earth , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their poisoned air and land . So could much of the Third World , where billions of people grievously stretch the capacity of forests and other resources . <P> In the U.S. , though , Earth Day 1990 comes at a time when environment is a motherhood issue . Since polls show that Americans want environmental protection regardless of costs , the problem is not so much awakening the nation to ecological threats as it is getting people to face the difficult choices entailed in dealing with those threats . For a number of reasons , Earth Day might actually thwart that end . <P> Mass events are crude instruments , useful for delivering slogans and chants but not well suited to deciding subtle issues that confront environmental converts who are trying to translate their concerns into practice . Whether people should buy biodegradable or recyclable plastics or switch from disposable to cloth diapers will not be settled on April 22 . <P> Earth Day fits into a troubling American pattern of responding to crises with rhetoric and theater . So far , it has been easy to be an environmentalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as middle-class voters routinely condemn " welfare " while opposing cuts in the social programs that constitute such spending , a good portion of the voters who claim they would pay for environmental improvements balk when the bill is presented . If consumers truly insisted on cleaner air in their individual buying and voting decisions , Detroit and Japan would vie to deliver less polluting cars , and it would not take ten years of struggle to amend the Clean Air Act . <P> Instead of making hard choices , it is easier to blow off steam . April 22 will offer people an opportunity to purge accumulated anxiety over wounds to earth 's life-support systems . Worn out by weeks of buildup and an accompanying media blitz , many people will return to business as usual on Monday , hoping not to hear the E word again for weeks . It is possible that the environment might be better served if consumers had no such outlet , and were forced to do some quiet soul searching about how their individual choices contribute to the world 's environmental problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
