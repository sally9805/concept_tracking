RELATED FACTORS learning to read faster is partly associated with perceptual learning that involves recognizing the visual shape of a word faster each time it is encountered , up until the maximum or asymptote rate is reached . Stanovich , Cunningham , and West ( 1981 ) studied automaticity in first graders by using the Stroop task . Words were presented in colors and the task was to name the color as fast as possible ; automaticity was measured by the increase in time taken to name the color of a word versus nonwords due to the automatic attention paid to recognizing the word . They studied first graders because other research ( Guttentag &; Haith , 1978 ; West &; Stanovich , 1979 ) " . . . strongly suggested that it is ( luring the first grade that the most marked changes occur " ( p. 60 ) . Their research was developmental in that they tested the same students at the beginning , middle , and the end of their first grade year . Stanovich et al . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-frequency words , and low-frequency words . There was automaticity for letters at the beginning of the year but not for words . By the end of the year there was automaticity for words also . There was consistently more automaticity for high-frequency words than for low-frequency words . These results are all in accordance with the idea that there is no automaticity ( 0% ) before the word is recognized with 100% accuracy . When the word is learned , i.e. , 100% accuracy is reached , then further practice results in less attention to the word . As attention decreases with further practice , we say that automaticity increases . So , automaticity increases from 0% ( at 100% accuracy ) to 100% when the point is reached of diminishing returns with practice ( see Fig. 17.1 ) . Stanovich also tested some second graders on the same words and found no further increases in automaticity . Also , the first graders were divided into skilled and less skilled and the differences between these two groups were in accordance with predictions made from automaticity theory . Individual differences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability and most of these were medium to large in effect size , 0.30 to 0.50 , when there was evidence that automaticity existed . However , these researchers deprecated the size of these correlations , and they did not consider the fact that the correlations were severely attenuated due to the notoriously low reliabilities associated with difference scores and ratio scores . The above results were interpreted by Stanovich et al . as implicating the first grade as the critical period for the development of automaty . They also concluded that : An important implication of the research reported here is that word recognition speed continues to increase even after recognition has become automa-1 17 . AUTOMATICITY AND PRACTICE / 3 6 1 tized . Thus , it is crucial that the distinction between speed and automaticity be made by reading theorists . ( p. 72 ) The above implications are in accordance with the theoretical learning curve presented in Fig. 17.1 . Also , the reason why first grade is so important is probably because that is the period when almost all the words encountered are at some level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high proportion of those encountered are at some level of automaticity between 0 and 100% . Beyond first grade , most of the words encountered by a typical student are likely to be automatically recognized . In another study , Carver and Hoffman ( 1981 ) studied the effect of practice via the repeated silent reading of passages . A computer was used to administer 50 ? 70 hours of practice to ninth and tenth graders reading at about the fifth grade level . Each student was presented 160 passages , about 100 words in length , that ranged from grade level 2 up to grade level 9 in difficulty . Every fifth word in a passage was presented with an alternative wrong word selected from the passage , and the student was supposed to select the original word that belonged in the passage by pressing one of two keys . Each passage was presented first as a test , with the student instructed to select the correct answers to the approximately 20 items as quickly as possible . Then , the passage was repeatedly administered until all 20 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage was administered again as a posttest under the same test conditions as the pretest . On a paper and pencil test that was similar in nature to the experimental task , there was a gain from the fifth grade level to the eighth grade level . However , this gain of three grade equivalents was not obtained on the various sections of the Gates MacGinitie Reading Test ; the gains were very small . Thus , this large effect size due to the treatment seemed to be specific to a type of test that was exactly similar to the experimental task . The above data indicate that giving poor reading high school students a great deal of reading practice involving decoding words and determining semantic meaning within the context of a sentence does not necessarily result in a large effect upon reading level , A , , , as measured by a typical standardized reading test . On the other hand , there was a 15% gain due to practice in a Rate of Good Reading measure used by these researchers . It is possible that this gain reflects a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsequential . For example , if the rauding rate of ' these students was also at the fifth grade level ( 5.5 ) , then it would be I63 Wpm , according to Appendix B , and a 15% gain would result in a rate of 187 Wpm which is the seventh grade level ( 7.2 ) . Therefore , the Carver and I Ioffman research on repeated reading practice leaves open 3 6 2 / Iv . RELATED FACTORS the possibility that poor readers can improve their rauding rate level , R1. , by practicing a task that requires lexical access and semantic encoding of the words in passages . However , these poor readers probably have slower cognitive speeds and may not be able to achieve decoding rates that approach those of good readers . Still , the poor readers may not read enough to keep their recognition rates up to their own maximums , and this type of repeated-reading practice may result in this type of benefit . Ehri and Wilce ( 1983 ) gave first , second , and fourth graders 6 and 18 trials of practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured their pre and post reaction times to these pseudo words ; this research followed up some of their earlier work in this area ( Ehri and Wilce , 1979 ) . Besides these CVCs there were three-letter , high-frequency words , e.g. , " cat " and " eat , " and also digits . And , there were skilled and less-skilled groups in each grade . Practice resulted in lower reaction times to the CVCs . Practice also resulted in about 400 msec lower reaction times to the high-frequency words for the less-skilled readers but not for the skilled readers . Practice did not result in a lower reaction time for digits . The above results can be interpreted as providing more support for the theoretical learning curves presented in Fig. 17.1 . The CVCs did show gain due to practice because none of these words had been practiced before so they could not have reached asymptote , or maximum rate . There were no gains associated with practice on the high-frequency words for the skilled readers because they had already reached asymptote , but there were gains for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach asymptote . The digits were highly practiced and were at asymptote for both groups , and that is why there was no improvement in digit-recognition speed due to practice in either the skilled or less-skilled groups . Ehri and Wilce interpreted their own results as providing support for a concept that they call " unitized " speed . They have conceived of a maximum rate for each word that is constant for all words . For each word as a unit , no matter how long the word in letters , they are theorizing that with practice each word can reach the same maximum rate . This theoretical idea of theirs may be credible for the laboratory where rate is measured in terms of reaction times to individual words . However , it is an idea that would not likely generalize to the rate at which the rauding process operates . If the rauding rate of long words was exactly the satin as short words , then college students should rand 100 actual words iii fifth grade level passages at the same rate in wpm as 100 actual words ul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carver ( 1983 ) hound that college students read fifth grade level material faster than eleventh grids 17 . AUTOMATICITY AND PRACTICE / 3 6 3 level material when rate is measured in actual words , wpm , instead of standard length words , Wpm . Thus , the unitized idea does not seem promising for generalizing about rauding rate . Instead , it seems more likely that the maximum rauding rate for a word varies with the length of the word in letters , or syllables , because fifth grade level material with shorter words is read at the same rate as eleventh grade level material with longer words when rate is measured in Wpm and the reader is likely to have reached asymptote for all the words . Ehri and Wilce 's research lends further credence to their idea that practice in decoding a word passes through the following phases : In Phase 1 , unfamiliar words become familiar and recognized accurately by readers directing their attention to component letters as they map sounds . During Phase 2 , as a result of more practice , familiar words come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberate processing of component letter ? sound relations . In Phase 3 the speed of processing familiar words increases to a maximum as the components involved in stimulus recognition and response production become consolidated or " unitized " in memory . ( p. 3 ) Their summary , above , is being questioned only with respect to the generality of the whole word or unitized concept . As noted above , it seems impossible for there to be a constant maximum rauding rate that is the same rate for each actual word . Instead , the maximum rauding rate probably varies across words for each individual depending upon the length of the word . Also , the maximum rate probably varies across individuals depending upon their cognitive speed , and this explains why the skilled readers reacted faster than the less skilled readers under every condition tested , including the highly overlearned digits . Finally , their research suggests that practice in decoding a known word results in a faster rauding rate as long as the word has not been encountered so many times that it has reached asymptote . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in accordance with the theoretical curves presented in Fig. 17.1 . Favreau and Segalowitz ( 1983 ) measured reaction times to English words and French words when presented to 60 bilingual readers , with English as the first language for 30 of these readers and with French as the first language for the other 30 . Within each group of 30 , 15 were reading at approximately the same rate in both languages ( about 275 wpm ) and 15 were reading slower in their second languages ( 318 versus 23/1 wpm ) . ' they reported that " ... reduced automatic processing by the unequal-reading-rate subjects in their second language compared with that in their first is of special interest because these bilinguals possess 3 6 4 / IV . RELATED FACTORS fluent and native-like language skills under normal conditions of listening , reading , and speaking " ( p. 571 ) . Notice that Favreau and Segalowitz did not make any distinction between automaticity and rate . Since they did not study automaticity in any more direct way than reaction time to words , it seems prudent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automaticity . This means that it is highly likely that all 60 of their subjects had reached automaticity for all of their experimental words , e.g. , bird , carrot , and potato , and that the reason why their slower reading language groups reacted slower to the second language was because they had not yet practiced them enough to reach asymptote . Indeed , these researchers hypothesized that a lack of practice may explain their results , and they did find that " . . . the equal-reading-rate bilinguals had been schooled longer in their second language than had the unequal-reading-rate bilinguals ... " ( p. 571 ) . Given that the unequal group read their second language at a mean rate of 234 wpm , it seems unlikely that they had not reached full automaticity for the highfrequency words used in the experiment . Yet , it is quite reasonable to accept the idea that they had not yet practiced them enough to reach the same asymptote as high-frequency words in their first language . Thus , these data also may be interpreted as providing empirical data in accordance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially the part of the curve between full automaticity and asymptote . Rashotte and Torgesen ( 1985 ) asked 12 " learning disabled " children to take part in two types of repeated reading training and one control condition . ( Note : These data were from a category excluded from the review , as stated in Chapter 1 ; these data were included because of the paucity of research on the effect of practice . ) In both types of repeated reading , the same passage was read aloud four times on each of seven days . In one of the two repeated reading conditions the seven 100-word passages were specially selected so that they had three times as many overlapping or common words as the other repeated reading condition . These two types of repeated readings were compared to a control condition wherein 28 different , unrelated , and nonoverlapping stories were read , 4 per day for 7 days . Under each condition , all of the students read four passages for about 15 min a day , for 7 days . Since all students took part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment took 21 days . The students were all reading at grade level 3 or higher and all the passages used in the experiment were at grade level 2 difficulty , so the materials were relatively easy , A , , #@# D , , . Rashotte and Torgesen reported that these students read an average of 49.7 wpm on the pretest and with only 6.45% word errors . Reading the same passages four times in one clay resulted in mean gains from the 17 . AUTOMATICITY AND PRACTICE / 3 6 5 first to the last reading of about 35 wpm for the two repeated-reading conditions . Unfortunately , there were no data presented that indicated how much gain there was orally in reading rate under each condition from the first passage read on Session 1 to the first passage read on Session 7 . Instead , the rate of gain was presented in terms of the slope across all seven conditions , after being controlled for variations in intercept . Statistically , this is all very proper and logical . However , some people will have trouble judging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most gain occurred when the seven passages being read had approximately 60 words in common ; the slope was 1.1 . This means that there was a gain in reading rate of about 1 wpm each 15 min session . If this rate of gain continued each day for an entire school year , it would represent a gain of 150 wpm . This would be a tremendous gain but it would not he meaningful because these gains would be very specific to the same 60 words . Much more relevant is the gain associated with passages that had few overlapping words , 20 or less , because these passages represent a more normal repeated-readings situation ; the passages are more representative of the population of passages at the second grade level and inform us better about the transfer effects for repeated-reading training . Under this condition the slope was 0.20 indicating that there would be gain of 1 wpm every 5 days ; extrapolating to a year in school with 150 days , this gain would be 30 wpm instead of the 150 wpm extrapolated value for the overlapping passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , 0.20 , needs to be compared to the slope of the control condition , 0.37 , indicating a rate of gain for the control condition almost twice as large as the latter repeated-reading condition . Again , extrapolating over a year 's time , this would represent a gain in oral reading rate of 56 wpm for the control condition . So , when extrapolated over a year 's time , the more normal repeated-reading condition resulted in the least gain , about 30 wpm , considerably less than the gain of 56 wpm from simply spending the same time reading new passages . Again , the highest gain of all resulted from the repeated-reading condition that involved passages that were especially selected because they had 60% overlapping words , about 150 wpm , but this result could only be generalized to a limited number of words and is not representative of normal repeated-reading training . ' These data of Rashotte and Torgesen suggest that the gain in rate due to repeated readings is very specifically tied to the number of practice trials associated with each encountered word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with the particular words involved . Reading different passages once produced more gain in rate than repeatedly reading the same passage . I 3 6 6 / IV . RELATED FACTORS Herman ( 1985 ) gave repeated-reading practice to eight students in grades 4 ? 6 who were selected from a class of 42 remedial readers who read aloud exceptionally slowly , 35 ? 50 wpm . The practice averaged 21 treatment days spread over a 3-month period . The practice involved stories at instructional level which were repeatedly read until a rate of 85 wpm was reached . The pre to post gain in rate of reading aloud was from a mean of 47 to 70 wpm . This gain appears to be substantial , and probably reflects a substantial gain in rauding rate . However , several caveats are in order . First , there was no control group . Second , these readers were exceptionally poor readers . Third , it was not perfectly clear whether or not the selection test was also the pretest ; if it was , the results may be due entirely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Shea ( 1985 ) compared two purpose conditions while students were engaged in repeated readings . The stories used were at the fourth grade level and the third grade students were selected so that these passages were at their instructional level . The 30 students were divided randomly into two treatment groups : one was instructed to read aloud as quickly and correctly as possible ( the rate group ) and the other was instructed to read aloud to try to remember as much of the story as they could ( the comprehension group ) . There were three experimental stories , and each student read each one under three repeated-reading conditions : once , three times , and seven times . When the story had been read the specified number of times , both groups knew that they would be asked to retell as much of the story as they could . Using the nomenclature from Chapter 14 , the rate group was engaged in a mixture of MORR ( Maximum Oral Reading Rate ) and RORR ( Rauding Oral Reading Rate ) because they were asked to read as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retell the story later . It is not surprising , therefore , that their mean rate prior to repeated readings ( the once condition ) was 117 wpm , considerably lower than the 158 wpm rate given for fourth graders in Table 2.1 . The comprehension group was engaged purely in RORR and they read even more slowly at 101 wpm . As might be expected , the rate group had consistently higher rate scores under all three repeated measures conditions , and the comprehension group had consistently higher comprehension scores under all three of these conditions . Both groups had increased their rate and comprehension scores at the end of three repeated readings , and there was another increase in these two measures at the end of seven repeated readings . These data verify that repeatedly reading the same passage results in higher reading rates , and also higher accuracy of ' comprehension scores ( see Carver , 1985a ) . However , these data do not indicate how much , if any , this repeated-reading practice improves , or helps maintain , 17 . AUTOMATICITY AND PRACTICE / 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no measure of possible transfer effects at the end of the treatment . CONCLUSIONS This chapter on automaticity and practice has presented research that leaves little doubt that the recognition of words involve three phases . The first phase involves learning to decode accurately , and has nothing directly to do with rauding rate . The second phase involves practice in decoding the word ( a ) with a resulting decrease in the time required to perceive the shape of the word , and ( b ) with a resulting decrease in the attention needed to recognize the word . After the word is recognized with little or no attention in the second phase , i.e. , it has been automatized , then the third phase has been reached wherein further practice results in further reductions in the time required to recognize the word until an asymptote is reached . This asymptote , or maximum rate , definitely varies between individuals with more highly skilled readers having a higher rate than less highly skilled readers . The above phases seem to apply especially well to beginning readers who already know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are within their auditory vocabulary . A theoretical learning curve was presented earlier in Fig. 17.1 that is more specific about the nature of the three phases , noted above . This learning curve contains the hypothesis that automaticity is directly associated with the initial part of the curve where automaticity increases from 0% to 100% as the rate of recognizing the word increases linearly . When full automaticity is reached , 100% , it is hypothesized that further practice results in diminishing returns with respect to further increases in rate . Then , it is hypothesized that an asymptote is reached for each word for each individual . This maximum rate varies within individuals between words depending upon word length , and varies between individuals depending upon their cognitive speed , C. Furthermore , it is theorized that a lack of practice for a word results in a lowering of its rauding rate . The preceding theoretical ideas ( a ) explain the reaction times of skilled and less skilled readers due to varying amounts of practice ( Hogabooin &; Perfetti , 1978 ) ; ( b ) explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and distorted text is read slower than normal text ( Snowling &; Frith , 1981 ) ; ( c ) explain why automaticity does not exist before a word is learned , increases as it is learned , and no longer increases after it is highly practiced ( Stanovich el al. , 1981 ) ; ( d ) explains why further practice on words that have already been highly practiced results in no further gains iii rate for skilled readers but sloes result in 3 6 8 / IV . RELATED FACTORS further gains for less-skilled readers ( Ehri &; Wilce , 1983 ) ; and ( e ) explains why repeatedly reading the same passage will only result in a higher rate for other passages when most of the words are the same ( Rashotte &; Torgesen , 1985 ) . The method of repeated readings is one way of practicing words that have not reached asymptote , i.e. , to read the same passage more than once results in a faster reading rate for the same words . However , it is clear that simply being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee that the passage will be comprehended any better ( higher accuracy , A ) , especially when the passage is relatively difficult ( Fleisher et al. , 1979 ) . Repeated-reading training is not likely to increase rauding rate because rauding rate is only meaningful when the material is relatively easy , Ai , #@# D , , , and therefore is likely to already be at asymptote . On the basis of hindsight , it seems clear that the method of repeated readings will only increase rauding rate when the passages contain words that have been practiced to automaticity but have not yet reached asymptote . The method of repeated readings is probably most effective in a situation that is not directly relevant to rauding rate and not directly relevant to automaticity theory . Repeatedly reading a passage is probably only effective when many of the words in the passage ( e.g. , 10% or more ) have not yet been learned to 100% accuracy , even though the meaning of the words are known auditorily . This situation probably only occurs when the individual is at the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of ability is reached , repeatedly reading first and second grade level passages will not help much because these words are already up to automaticity . Repeatedly reading third grade level passages may be helpful since the unknown words are probably known auditorily ; however , there will be so many known words in relationship to unknown words , that reading the same passages four times is not as effective as reading four new passages once . Indeed , the data that have been reviewed seem to support the following neo-automaticity theory : the best way to increase rauding rate would be to spend a great deal of time rauding relatively easy passages so as to keep all of these known words up to asymptote . The only place that repeated reading is likely to be especially helpful is for students at the first grade level of rauding ability wherein almost every passage they encounter has many visually unknown words but 100% of the words are known auditorily . In this situation , the method of repeated readings will help get the unknown words tip to 100% accuracy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known words that are not yet up to full automaticity. 17 . AUTOMATICITY AND PRACTICE / 3 6 9 Extensive practice in recognizing known words in relatively easy material is likely to have no effect on rauding rate because there can be no improvement beyond asymptote , and this maximum rate can probably be maintained without the extensive practice associated with repeated readings . However , as readers progress up the scale of rauding accuracy level , AL , they will always be encountering unknown words when the materials are at a matched level of difficulty , A , , = D , , or are relatively difficult , A , , DL . Therefore , these unknown words will all have to pass through the automaticity phase where they must be practiced enough to reach full automaticity . Even though rauding rate inherently involves full automaticity , the attempt to operate the rauding process at the rauding rate will often fail when the material being read is at matched level , A , , = D , , or relatively hard , AL @#@ DL . Therefore , improvement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D , , so that the rauding process can eventually operate at the rauding rate on these materials . So , automaticity is continually involved in rauding ability because it is an inherent part of RL and it is directly involved in improving AL . Probably the most helpful consequence of automaticity theory is that it has stimulated research on rate and practice . These two factors have been neglected by almost all researchers in recent years , except for those who have been interested in testing automaticity theory and related hypotheses . Since practice in the execution of the rauding process on relatively easy material is probably the only way that individuals can maintain their rauding rate at the maximum set by cognitive speed , and since practice in decoding new words at matched level , A , = D , , is probably the most important way to improve A , , , it follows that practice in rauding deserves a great deal more research . The potency of rauding practice as the primacy cause of improvement in rauding ability needs to be empirically determined . // INTRODUCTION Rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read faster because it is not too difficult to induce students to shift up from their rauding process to a skimming process that proceeds at a faster rate . Students can be trained to increase their reading rate to two to three times normal with only a few minutes or a few hours of instruction ( e.g. , see Raygor , Wark , &; Warren , 1966 ; Tirrell , Mount , &; Scott , 1977 ) . It is not particularly difficult to get students to read faster when they are given questions after reading that are easy to answer even at the faster skimming rates . However , there is no evidence that the rauding rate , Rr , of individuals can be improved by such training . Research data do exist suggesting that reading rate can be increased by 50% or more without any loss of comprehension ; however , those data are not valid for drawing sound conclusions , as will be discussed later . This chapter will review the research that has been conducted on rapid reading training . However , this subject has generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wood ( 1960 ) claimed to have discovered a " breakthrough " in reading , relevant to her commercially available speed reading course , and Spache ( 1962 ) among others , has questioned that breakthrough . The pro opinions ( e.g. , Combs , 1966 ; Hellebust , 1973 ) and the con opinions ( e.g. , Ekwall , 1969 ; Graham , 1975 ) will not be reviewed , and neither will the various books , video cassettes , and audio cassettes that tell you how to speed read ( e.g. , see N. B. Smith , 1957 ) . Furthermore , there have been numerous review articles iii this area and they will not be treated ( e.g. , Berger , 1966 ; Carver , I987d ; Poulton , 1961 ) . As noted above , the subject of speed reading and rapid reading does 18 . RAPID READING TRAINING / 3 7 1 not suffer from a lack of firm opinion , representing wide disagreements . Ordinarily , research is counted upon to reduce the confusions that fuel conflicting opinions . Unfortunately , most of the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lessening it . This is because of many methodological pitfalls that have not been avoided in prior research . In short , most of the research has not met minimum research standards . D. T. Campbell and Stanley ( 1963 ) have classified research designs into pre-experimental and experimental ; preexperimental designs lack the appropriate controls for internal and external validity . Probably more than half of the RRT research that has been conducted is readily classified as pre-experimental . Even the experimental research has failed to avoid pitfalls . Before reviewing the relevant research , an entire section will be devoted to explicating known methodological pitfalls . METHODOLOGICAL PITFALLS Rate-Measurement Pitfall Any measure of rate that counts the number of words read in a certain length of time but fails to estimate the degree to which the words have been comprehended should not he used to determine the effectiveness of rapid reading training . For example , the Nelson ? Denny Reading Test measures reading rate by counting the number of words read during the first minute of reading a 600-word passage . ( Note : Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length in Chapter 13 . ) This measure of rate includes no estimate of the percentage of comprehension that accompanied the words read during that one minute . A typical college student will have a reading rate score of about 250 ? 275 wpm when the Nelson ? Denny is given before training ? as a pretest . Since training ordinarily consists of getting students to use a skimming process , they will ordinarily read much faster during the one minute that rate is measured at the beginning of the posttest . They may skim 500 words during this one minute on the posttest , but there is no accompanying estimate or measure of what percentage of the ideas or sentences were comprehended . It is a pitfall to use a measure such as this to evaluate improvement in rauding rate . This pitfall will be called the Rate-Measurement Pitfall . Other tests , such as the Diagnostic Reading ' Pests , suffer front the same limitations as the Nelson ? Denny when t hey arc used to evaluate training or instruction in reading . However , the pitfall occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 3 7 2 / IV . RELATED FACTORS has been used more than any other test to evaluate reading improvement courses ( Sweiger , 1972 ) . The nature of this pitfall has been aptly stated by Morton ( 1959 ) , as follows : Use of a rate of reading measure , without reference to the individual 's comprehension level in the same passage , a measure used by many investigators , would seem totally unsatisfactory , since , at its crudest , one has only to instruct the student to read at twice his normal speed to double his rate of reading . ( p. 226 ) Examples of studies that have failed to avoid the Rate-Measure Pitfall are Carpenter and Jones ( 1975 ) ; Collins ( 1979 ) ; Cosper and Mills ( 1953 ) ; Rankin ( 1963 ) ; Swaim and Kling ( 1973 ) . **25;722;TOOLONG Pitfalls There are two pitfalls to avoid when measuring comprehension , and they will be discussed in turn . The first and most important pitfall associated with comprehension measurement is the use of questions that are easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple to write multiple-choice questions on a passage that are not sensitive to changes in comprehension . For example , look at the item below that was taken from an actual test used in an unpublished research study designed to investigate speed reading training . Which one of the following least represents a folk society ? 1 . A group of people of similar ethnic backgrounds living close together in a city . 2 . A group of survivors from a ship who land on a desert island . 3 . The Aborigine of Australia . 4 . The Pueblo Indians of the Southwestern United States . Notice that it is not too difficult to figure out the most likely answer to this item without even reading the passage . The item is not passage dependent ( see Tuinman , 1973 ) . Therefore , items like these will produce mean scores around 75% when the passage has been read at a rate of 250 ? 300 Wpm and these kinds of items will also produce mean scores around 75% when the rate is 450 ? 500 Wpm . The item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehension , A , due to a switch from the rauding process to a skimming process . Therefore , the items might be called skimming items because 70% or more can still be answered correctly after the execution of a skimming process . This first pitfall associated with comprehension measurement will he called the Skimming-Items Pitfall . Laffitte ( 1964 ) apparently was aware of this pitfall when he suggested that " a student can learn to skint material on 18 . RAPID READING TRAINING / 3 7 3 reading tests and still perform relatively well on comprehension questions which query them on material found in a few major portions of selections " ( p. 165 ) . Research on the effects of RRT can attempt to avoid the SkimmingItems Pitfall by collecting data on the items themselves . One technique that has been used is to administer the items to a comparable control group without administering the experimental treatment . Scores made under this no-passage-control condition provide an estimate of zero comprehension . For example , Carver ( 1972a ) used a no-passage-control condition to help measure the sensitivity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught using the Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics method . The no-passage-control group correctly answered 51% of the items on a fiction passage and correctly answered 57% of the items on a nonfiction passage . Therefore , a 51% score on the fiction test can be interpreted as 0% accuracy of comprehension and a 57% , score on the nonfiction test can also be interpreted as 0% accuracy of comprehension . The corresponding scores made by the speed reading trainees in that research look quite respectable at 68% for fiction and 68% for nonfiction , until it is noted that 51% and 57% represent 0% accuracy of comprehension . This no-passage-control condition has also been applied to the Nelson ? Denny Reading Test . Carver ( 1971e ) reported that 60 college students taking both the Form A and Form B test questions without reading the passages averaged 40% on the tests . From these results , raw scores of 14.4 correct responses out of the 36 items on this test , 40% , could be interpreted to mean that none of the complete thoughts in the passages was comprehended . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly to the questions came from reading the passages . Poulton ( 1961 ) reported that he was able to answer 63% of the 120 questions on the passages used for one rapid reading program without ever reading the passages themselves . Sometimes , standardized tests like the Nelson ? Denny are not used ; instead , specially developed passages and test items are used . The time to read each passage is used to calculate wpm and then the comprehension items are administered untimed . One of the best ways to avoid the Skimming-Items Pitfall under these test conditions would be to administer the passages and the comprehension test items to a comparable control group under the same time conditions as the speed reading trainees . For example , suppose the speed reading trainees read the 300-word test passages at an average rate of 6(X) wpm and scored 75% . A comparable control group could he given the test passages to read for 311 sec , which is an average rate of GOO wpm . Then , if this control group 3 7 4 / Iv . RELATED FACTORS scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50% we would be in a better position to surmise that the speed reading training was likely to have improved the reading ability of the experimental group . On the other hand , if this control group scored close to 75% we could surmise that the test consisted of skimming items , and that speed reading training was not effective . In summary , the two techniques advanced for avoiding the SkimmingItems Pitfall were the use of a no-passag - control group and a skimming control group . Without some evidence that the Skimming-Items Pitfall has been avoided in research , it woul seem to be reasonable to assume that the research findings were not valid . Examples of research that failed to avoid this pitfall are Brown and McDowell ( 1979 ) ; Mullins and Mowry ( 1953 ) ; Tuckey ( 1960 ) . The second pitfall associated with comprehension measurement involves the failure to estimate properly the percentage comprehension associated with the material that was read . For example , suppose the Nelson ? Denny Reading Test is used as a pretest and as a posttest for a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid reading training . This test has eight items on the first passage , and four on the remaining seven passages for a total of 36 items . Consider a typical sophomore who has time to finish the first six passages and answers 24 out of these 28 items correctly . The best available measure of comprehension in this situation would be to correct for guessing using a standard correction for guessing formula such as C = R ? W ! ( A ? 1 ) ( 18.1 ) where C is the corrected for guessing score , I ? is the number right , or number of correct items , A is the number of possible alternatives to each item , and W is the number of wrong items . The Nelson ? Denny has five alternatives for each answer so the score of 24 correct , in the example above , would be corrected as follows : C = 24 ? 4/4 = 23 In this example , the best available indicant of the accuracy of comprehension would be 23/28 which is 82% , or A = 0.82 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induced to operate a skimming process that operated about 50% faster so she finished the entire test and again answered 24 correctly . This time , however , it was 24 correct and 12 wrong out of 36 . The corrected score would be : C = 24 ? 12/4=21 // The best available indicant of the accuracy of comprehension would be 21/36 which is 58% , or A = 0.58 . In this latter situation , the individual has actually read the passages about 50% faster but the best available estimate of the accuracy of comprehension indicates that A dropped from 82% on the pretest to 58% on the posttest . The pitfall here involves the failure to calculate the best available estimates of the accuracy of comprehension , noted above . The Nelson ? Denny uses the number correct score and does not correct for guessing . Therefore , in this situation the individual 's comprehension score would be reported as 24 on the pretest and 24 on the posttest , and interpreted as no loss in comprehension . Instead , the best available estimates would indicate a 24% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comprehension . This second pitfall associated with measuring comprehension , described above , will be called the Percent-Comprehension Pitfall . There is seldom a good excuse for estimating comprehension in a manner that fails to use the standard formula to correct for guessing because guessing is ordinarily what is involved when individuals answer well-written , multiple-choice questions on a passage they have just finished skimming . Therefore , investigations of the effects of speed reading training that do not properly estimate the degree of comprehension of the material that was read by using a correction for guessing formula have succumbed to the Percent-Comprehension Pitfall ; the results are therefore relatively invalid with respect to generalizations about the accuracy of comprehension . An example of a study that failed to avoid this pitfall was conducted by Averill and Mueller ( 1928 ) . In summary , the two pitfalls associated with comprehension measurement are the Skimming-Items Pitfall and the Percent-Comprehension Pitfall . When RRT is being evaluated , items that purport to measure the accuracy of comprehension must be sensitive to drops in the accuracy of comprehension , i.e. , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be measured on material that was covered using a correction for guessing formula , i.e. , the Percent-Comprehension Pitfall must be avoided . Efficiency-Index Pitfall This pitfall involves the failure to recognize that the comprehension score on a test such as the Nelson ? Denny is a relatively valid correlate of reading efficiency level , E , . Remember the example earlier where an individual correctly answered 24 of 28 items on the pretest and 24 of 36 items oil the posttest . The corrected scores of 23 and 21 , respectively , would validly reflect individual differences in rauding efficiency level . In 3 7 6 / IV . RELATED FACTORS this example , the individual 's index of rauding efficiency level would have declined ( from 23 to 21 ) as a result of taking a course in rapid reading . In this example , the effect of spending 8 weeks taking a course in reading improvement would have resulted in a loss in reading ability as indexed by this test because less was being comprehended in a fixed amount of time . As discussed above , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Denny test would be the corrected for guessing score on the test ; but this score is not ordinarily calculated , only the number correct is reported . It should be noted , however , that the number correct is usually not very different from the corrected for guessing scores ; in the example above , the two uncorrected scores were 24 and 24 while their corresponding corrected scores changed only to 23 and 21 , and this is probably an extreme example because most individuals will finish more than six of the eight passages on the pretest . Therefore , the Comprehension score on the Nelson ? Denny provides a valid rough correlate of individual differences in rauding efficiency level , EL . Since a group given RRT is likely to answer more items on the posttest , equal pretest and posttest scores would mean that efficiency has actually decreased because the correction for guessing score on the posttest is likely to be lower than the pretest in these situations . Earlier , in Chapter 9 , it was noted that there is research evidence supporting the theoretical assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of efficiency , i.e. , E , , . Carver ( 1990d ) factor analyzed the three scores on the Nelson ? Denny test ( Rate , Comprehension , and Vocabulary ) and found that the Comprehension score was measuring an efficiency factor . Notice that reading comprehension on the Nelson ? Denny does not mean the accuracy of comprehension , as might be expected ; instead , reading comprehension is actually an indicant of rauding efficiency level , E , , , which includes both rauding rate level , R , , , and rauding accuracy level , A , . It is a pitfall when the Rate score on the Nelson ? Denny increases pre to post and then the lack of a drop in the comprehension score is misinterpreted as indicating that rate can be increased with no loss in comprehension . Instead , the invalid Rate score on the Nelson ? Denny should be disregarded because of the Rate-Measurement Pitfall and the Comprehension score should be interpreted as providing a roughly valid correlate of EL . If there is no pre to post change in the Comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the RR'l ' was ineffective because reading faster did not result iii any more comprehension questions being answered correctly during the time allowed , i.e. , the individuals rauding efficiency level did not improve . Stated differently , the 18 . RAPID READING TRAINING / 3 7 7 Comprehension score on the Nelson ? Denny does not reflect accuracy but does reflect reading efficiency . It is somewhat surprising that there was no indication in the research literature that this pitfall has been previously recognized . If RRT does result in passages being read two to three times faster with no loss in comprehension , why would the RR " I ' trainee not finish more passages on the posttest and thereupon answer more items correctly ? If , in fact , there was an increase in the rate but no loss in the accuracy of comprehension after RRT , then an increase in the Comprehension score would constitute evidence for an increase in efficiency . When there is no change in the Comprehension score on the Nelson ? Denny , this means ( a ) no change in efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accuracy since rate is likely to have increased . This failure to use the comprehension score on tests similar to the Nelson ? Denny as an index of efficiency level when evaluating the effects of RRT has been called the Efficiency-Index Pitfall . Those research studies that found rapid reading trainees to have increased their Rate score on the Nelson ? Denny , for example , but showed no loss in the Comprehension score have been misinterpreted as providing support for RRT . Instead , all of these studies that succumbed to the Efficiency-Index Pitfall must be reinterpreted as providing evidence against the helpfulness of RRT because it did not result in any increase in reading efficiency as reflected by a correlate of EL . All of the following are studies that failed to note that their comprehension scores did not provide support for the efficacy of RRT because they reflected no improvement in reading efficiency : Averill and Mueller ( 1928 ) ; Brandt ( 1975 ) ; Collins ( 1979 ) ; Cosper and Mills ( 1953 ) ; Labmeier and Vockell ( 1973 ) ; Laffitte ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a number of problems associated with the failure to have a comparable control group when evaluating RRT . All of these preexperimental designs suffer from the known threats to internal validity that have been explicated by D. T. Campbell and Stanley ( 1963 ) , as was noted earlier . There is the testing effect whereby the rapid reading trainees improve their scores from pre to post simply because they had practice with the tests , not because of the treatment . For example , Labmeier and Vockell ( 1973 ) found a pre to post comprehension gain on the Nelson ? Denny of 18.2 to 20.0 questions answered correctly . However , this gain of about 2 more questions answered correctly could easily have resulted front practice in taking the test , a difference between Form A and 14nnc R , ur even guessing due to answering more items ( the Percent3 7 8 / IV . RELATED FACTORS Comprehension Pitfall ) . A control group would help eliminate some of these threats to internal validity . There is also the problem of dropouts : those students who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more likely to drop out before post-testing thereby inflating the group means in an artifactual manner . Any research that does not include a control group should not be seriously considered as providing evidence for the efficacy of RRT . The problems associated with having no control group in reading research were discussed by McDonald ( 1963 ) . He was most concerned with " placebo " responses . He said : In fact , placebo responses may account for 60 to 80% of all outcomes of programs which are taught by highly enthusiastic instructors who have thrown off the " fetters " of " old-fashioned statistical and experimental methods , " and who rely principally on non-standardized methods of evaluation . Almost every review of research cites one or more reports of " gains " produced by the simple device of urging the students to read faster or by the somewhat more sophisticated method of using daily rate tests without comprehension checks . ( p. 225 ) Studies that have been published but did not avoid the No-ControlGroup Pitfall are as follows : Averill and Mueller ( 1928 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Carpenter and Jones ( 1975 ) ; Cosper and Mills ( 1953 ) ; Flynn ( 1977 ) ; Goldstein and Justman ( 1942 ) ; Labmeier and Vockell ( 1973 ) ; Mann ( 1957 ) ; McCracken ( 1960 ) ; Mullins and Mowry ( 1953 ) ; Remmers and Stalnaker ( 1928 ) ; Ruppel ( 1979 ) ; Schale ( 1972 ) ; Schmidt ( 1972 ) ; Simpson ( 1940 ) ; H. P. Smith and Tate ( 1953 ) ; Thompson and Whitehill ( 1970 ) ; Tuckey ( 1960 ) . Test-Treatment Pitfall In some research situations , the rapid reading training involves answering questions on passages that are just like the questions and passages given pre and post to evaluate the training . In this situation , the gain is quite specific to the treatment and thereby has no external validity . The trainees may learn from feedback during each class about how to read the passages faster and still be able to answer the kinds of questions on the tests , especially when the questions are more associated with the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning how to spend their time on the passages more effectively , the trainees may also learn certain skills that help them answer the test questions themselves . It is difficult for an item writer to make all distractors equally difficult and there are likely to be stylistic factors that trainees could lean th , it a control group would not be able to learn . Therefore , even reseal ( li 18 . RAPID READING TRAINING / 3 7 9 studies which have avoided all of the above mentioned pitfalls may succumb to this one . In these situations the pitfall can be avoided by including pre and post measures that are dissimilar to those involved during RRT , thereby reducing the threat to external validity posed by this pitfall . Two research studies that illustrate the failure to avoid the TestTreatment Pitfall are Goldstein and Justman ( 1942 ) ; and McCracken ( 1960 ) . Statistical Significance Pitfall Too often it is not recognized that ( a ) a statistically significant difference can be a small and trivial difference when the sample size is large , and ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and important difference when the sample size is small . It is best if the statistical significance of the results is completely disregarded because the use of statistical significance to make decisions in research involves a corrupt form of the scientific method ( Carver , 1976 ) . However , it is not a pitfall to report the results of tests of statistical significance because these data can be safely disregarded by any reader without any negative consequences . The pitfall is to report only the p values and other results directly associated with the tests of statistical significance without giving any of the data from the study which allow an evaluation of effect size ( see Carver , 1984a ) and sampling error . For example , some studies of the effects of RRT have not reported means or standard deviations of the rate scores or the comprehension scores ? only p values , t-values , F-values , df values , etc. have been reported . When this information about statistical significance is justifiably disregarded because it tells us nothing about whether the size of the differences obtained are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reliable or unreliable , then there is nothing left to evaluate the effect of the training . Several studies have succumbed to this Statistical Significance Pitfall , such as the following : Berger ( 1968a ) ; Collins ( 1979 ) ; Francis , Collins , and Cassell ( 1973 ) ; Hansen ( 1977 ) ; Moss ( 1980 ) ; Sailor and Ball ( 1975 ) . No-Test-Description Pitfall The failure to describe the items or techniques used to measure comprehension is a serious pitfall . There needs to be a description of the item type , such as multiple-choice or true ? false , how many items there were , how the comprehension score was obtained , etc . This kind of infortn:ttion is basic to any study and the failure to provide it is a sure sign t hat the research can be safely disregarded when evaluating the effects of RRT. 3 8 0 / IV . RELATED FACTORS The following studies illustrate the failure to avoid this No-TestDescription Pitfall : Brown ( 1976 ) ; Francis et al . ( 1973 ) ; Himelstein and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moss ( 1980 ) ; Remmers and Stalnaker ( 1928 ) ; Schale ( 1972 ) . No-Comprehension-Measure Pitfall This last pitfall is perhaps the most serious one of all . It is the failure to include any measure of comprehension when using silent reading to evaluate the effects of RRT . Three studies that failed to avoid the NoComprehension-Measure Pitfall were as follows : Lauer ( 1936 ) ; Thompson and Whitehill ( 1970 ) ; Tirrell et al . ( 1977 ) . RESEARCH In 1920 , Stone and Colvin published what appears to be the first study of RRT . However , this research will not be reviewed in any detail because the treatment was only sketchily described . Two years later Stone ( 1922 ) published a much more descriptive report and it appears to be the first thorough study of the effects of RRT . At the outset , it is interesting to note that among the motives for improvement listed by Stone was " the large amount of silent reading demanded by the life of today " ( p. 10 ) , a reason still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a course in rapid reading . Stone 's treatment consisted of extensive practice . Students were expected to use their " required reading " for practice , such as their textbooks for an educational psychology class . They were asked ( a ) to refrain from " lip movement and inner articulation , " ( b ) to concentrate on reading faster while still trying to comprehend , ( c ) to concentrate effectively , ( d ) to make long , well controlled eye movements , and ( e ) to " perceive meanings at a glance . " He reported that students were encouraged and helped to remove their own hinderances to faster reading and that the most difficult hinderance to remove was inner articulation . It should not go unnoticed that these fundamentals of RRT are almost exactly the same as present day techniques for RRT ( see Bergquist , 1984 ) . Stone reported average gains in rate on a test , called the Monroe I I I and Stone Extensions , to be from 36% to 108% in four classes that ranged in size from 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tike the test had a rate gain of 32% . The gain in average comprehensions scores on this same test ranged from 36% to 74% fin these same him classes while the control group gained 21% . On the surface , these data appear to provide strong support for RRT but I was not able to obtain 18 . RAPID READING TRAINING / 3 8 1 enough descriptive information to evaluate this test properly . The Sixth Mental Measurement Yearbook by Buros ( 1965 ) contains two reviews which were in strong agreement that the Monroe test was not good enough for anyone to use . The Stone Extensions were never described . Stone ( 1922 ) concluded that ( a ) " the typical college student may readily increase his rate of silent reading ability 50% to 100% , " ( b ) " the limits of silent reading ability are not known and probably have not been reached , " and ( c ) " marked improvement may be secured by approaching improvement through emphasis on increased rate ? increased rate with increased comprehension " ( p. 22 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong support for RRT . Yet , it is probably best if this study is not interpreted with respect to whether RRT improves rauding rate , R , , at least until enough descriptive information is obtained about the test that was used to determine whether Stone avoided known pitfalls . O'Brien ( 1926 ) reported upon the most extensive study of RRT ever conducted . He measured the reading rate of 848 students in 20 schools scattered across Illinois . It involved grades 3-8 , and required 289 pages to report . He created equally matched pairs in each of the classrooms . One of each pair matched on reading rate was given 8 weeks of daily instruction ( 30 min/day ) in RRT ( experimental group , N = 424 ) while the other one of each pair was not given the instruction ( control group , N = 424 ) . RRT for O'Brien , as well as for most of his subsequent counterparts such as Bergquist ( 1984 ) , noted earlier , consisted in admonitions to go fast , not subvocalize , and not regress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading rapidly . O'Brien reported a 31% increase in reading rate ( a gain of 46 words per minute ) for the experimental group as compared to the control group . He also reported that the experimental group was 1.6% more accurate in answering the questions correctly on the Courtis Silent Reading Test . O'Brien ( 1926 ) himself pointed out that this test has a major weakness ; he said , " At the time the score for rate of reading is determined , there is no measure taken of the comprehension that accompanied such reading " ( p. 167 ) . Thus , O'Brien was aware of the Rate-Measurement Pitfall . Therefore , it is quite likely that the students who received the RRT slowed down immediately after their rate was measured so they could answer the questions more accurately . One indication of whether or not the Rate-Measurement Pitfall was important would come from the number of questions they attempted and also from the total number of questions they answered correctly , compared to the control group . As a secondary analysis , O'Brien did look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the experimental group , but it is a mystery as to why he never reported any corresponding results for the control 3 8 2 / IV . RELATED FACTORS group . Since the author devoted three pages to a lecture on the importance of " individual control " as reflected in matched pairs , it is strange to say the least that the results of the control group for the most important measure in the entire study were omitted ? especially in a 289-page report . In summary , O'Brien conducted an exquisite study of rapid reading training from the standpoint of experimental design , with his large sample sizes and his detailed attention to the control groups . But , from a 1980s perspective , his measures of the accuracy and rate of comprehension were inadequate and his analyses of the data were inconsistent and flawed . Unfortunately , it is impossible to ascertain whether his results support RRT or not . Averill and Mueller ( 1928 ) conducted an RRT study with 16 college seniors . The students were engaged in the training over a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These researchers said that they emphasized the same factors as O'Brien ( 1926 ) did in his training . Their rate measures from 2 min of reading were 252 wpm on the pretest and 504 wpm on the posttest . Averill and Mueller reported results from an unusual kind of comprehension measure based upon 2 min of reading , namely , number of words reproduced . It is not clear exactly how this was measured but it seems to be a count of the number of words covered that were subsequently recalled and written down . They reported an 11% increase in the number of words reproduced from pre to post ( 144.6 to 160 ) but this measure does not avoid the Percent-Comprehension Pitfall because it was not converted into percentage comprehension ; the 144.6 words reproduced from the 504 words read on the pretest is 29% while the 160 words reproduced out of the 1004 read on the posttest is 16% . Thus , this index of the accuracy of comprehension indicates that comprehension was cut in half while rate was doubled . Additionally , a small drop occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCall Reading Scale , from 58.8 to 56.0 , pre to post . This Averill and Mueller research appears to be the first to succumb to the Efficiency-Index Pitfall . The comprehension score on the Thorndike ? McCall Reading Scale is probably a roughly valid index of reading efficiency and this index decreased as a result of the RRT , thus indicating that the RRT was not effective in helping these students read more efficiently . Yet , these same data were interpreted by these researchers as indicating that " marked increase in the speed of reading may be effected without any impairment of the comprehension " ( p . I29 ) . Finally , this is also the first known study of RRT that did not use a control group , thus becoming the first to succumb to this pitfall . These data must be intet18. // preted as providing no support for the efficiency of RRT , in direct opposition to the authors ' interpretation of the same data . Lauer ( 1936 ) studied the reading rates of college students before and after 20 practice sessions . Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own textbooks during daily study periods . The mean reading rate of all 346 subjects was 248 wpm and the mean improvement from the beginning to the end of the 20 practice sessions was 35% . This research is notable because it appears to be the first published on the effect of RRT that did not include any measure of comprehension , the first that failed to avoid the **28;749;TOOLONG Pitfall . Weber ( 1939 ) gave RRT to college students ; it involved 6 weeks of tachistoscopic exercises , among other treatments . The 25 students in the experimental group were selected to be comparable initially to the 25 in the control group . The scores on the comprehension section of the Iowa Advanced Silent Reading Test were almost identical after training , 130.4 versus 129.8 , respectively . Yet , the data collected , presented in several tables , were interpreted by Weber as providing support for RRT . Acknowledging the Efficiency-Index Pitfall , these data can alternatively be interpreted as providing no support for RRT . Bear ( 1939 ) provided a lengthy description of the Dartmouth program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the campus as " speeded reading . " The remedial group was mostly freshmen , one-half of which were officially requested to participate because of low test scores or low grades and the other half " did the work entirely on their own initiative " ( p. 74 ) . The control group was the remainder of the freshman class . Bear reported that when the mean gains between September and May for the remedial and control groups were compared , " the remedial group was found to score 7.8 points higher in comprehension , 7.9 points higher in rate , and 37.7 more words read per minute . Unfortunately , he did not report the actual rates pre and post . Even worse , these small gains could be due entirely to regression to the mean since a large portion of the remedial group was selected from the freshman class at the beginning of the year because of their low test scores . Therefore , it would not be prudent to interpret this small gain of 37.7 wpm as evidence for the efficacy of RRT . Dearborn and Wilking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experiment 1 involved two groups of Harvard freshmen , 16 in the experimental group and 16 in the control group . Two standardized reading tests were administered but only percentile ranks on these tests were reported , i.e. , no raw scores and no rates in wpm ; the results favored the experimental group . It was also reported that " the 3 8 4 / IV . RELATED FACTORS photographic records of the experimental group showed an increased rate of reading from 251 to 382 wpm " ( p. 669 ) , but there were no comprehension scores associated with these measures . In Experiment 2 , it was stated that " A control group was formed , and its members were paired with those who received remedial instruction " ( p. 670 ) , and this was the extent of the description of the control group . The results were favorable to the experimental group ; reading rate increased from 248 to 333 wpm in the experimental group on the Nelson ? Denny test , thereby illustrating the Rate-Measurement Pitfall . Experiment 3 had no control group . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could also be argued that the research did not meet minimum research standards . Bridges ( 1941 ) performed an experiment with 129 students in grades 4 , 5 , and 6 . This research appears to have avoided all the known pitfalls discussed earlier . Three comparable groups of 43 were each given a different treatment for 20 min each day for 40 days over a period from February to May . The speed group was told the tests showed they needed to read faster , and the treatment focused on getting them to read faster . The comprehension group was told the tests showed they needed to read more carefully , and the treatment focused on getting them to read more carefully . The control group was asked to read in their book each day . On the posttests , the speed group had the highest rate scores ( GE = 7.7 compared to 6.7 and 6.4 ) and the lowest comprehension scores ( GE = 5.4 compared 5.7 and 5.9 ) . Bridges concluded that " . . . it seems likely that over-emphasis on speed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole at this level , but may actually tend to retard the development of comprehension " ( pp. 317 ? 318 ) . These data do not support RRT . Goldstein and Justman ( 1942 ) . reviewed prior research on RRT and noted that there had been no studies in a typical classroom " . . . where the necessity of covering a certain amount of course content makes extended experiments impossible , and where expensive apparatus is not available " ( p. 510 ) . They set out to remedy this by conducting two experiments . In the first experiment , they told their students that ( a ) most students can improve their reading , ( b ) whispering and lip movements tend to slow up reading , ( c ) rapid reading can be attained from few and short fixations , ( d ) students should try to see phrases , even entire sentences at a glance , ( e ) reading should not be a passive absorption of ideas but instead should anticipate what the author is going to say , and ( f ) students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster-than-convenient . " It should be noted again that this same advice could probably 1w found in any RRT instruction today . Ten minutes at the beginning of 1.1 class 18 . RAPID READING TRAINING / 3 8 5 meetings were devoted to practice on these factors that were supposed to improve their reading . The students read passages and then answered questions . Goldstein and Justman reported that the average gain from the first practice to the last was 383 to 661 wpm , and the average comprehension score improved from 12.1 to 14.1 . Disregarding the measurement problems involved in mixing multiple-choice questions and completion questions on the same tests , this appears to be the first published RRT study that failed to avoid the Test Treatment Pitfall . There was no way of estimating the degree to which subjects simply learned how to answer these particular kinds of questions better from the first practice to the last . In the second experiment , students brought 1000-word passages of their own choosing for the class and then wrote ten true ? false items . This time rate increased from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 14th and last practice session , and the comprehension scores increased from 8.4 to 8.7 . Again , there was no evidence that the Test-Treatment Pitfall has been avoided . Without any evidence that this pitfall had been avoided , it is impossible to consider these data as providing support for the efficacy of RRT . Furthermore , there was no control group in either of these two experiments . Kilby ( 1945 ) investigated the effect of four types of college reading instruction : intensive reading , rapid reading with thorough comprehension , rapid reading , and skimming . Freshmen were invited to participate in the 16 one-hour training periods if they scored low on the Iowa Silent Reading Tests . The students were compared on their average grades in course work on a scale from 0 to 100 . Each group was compared with each of the other groups and with controls who did not volunteer but had academically comparable scores prior to the training . One reason for reviewing this research is to point out that students who volunteer for such courses are ordinarily more motivated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not comparable to students matched on pretest scores . The average grade in all course work at the end of the semester in which the training took place , was 2 ? 3 points higher than the matched controls , a rather small difference on a scale from 0 to 100 . More important , however , was the fact that the first group who focused on practicing intensive , thorough , and careful reading had better average grades in all course work than either of the two groups that focused upon rapid reading , 3 points better than one group and 1 point better than the other . Kilby published a large amount of data , collected as part of his doctoral dissertation , but none were as important as that summarized above . Therefiore it seems reasonable to conclude that Kilby presented no sound evidence to support RRT as a method for improving the grades of college freshmen. 3 8 6 / IV . RELALEI ) FACTORS Lewis ( 1949 ) compared two methods of RRT , one that focused primarily upon eye movements and the other that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent 1.5 hours per session using mechanical techniques designed to improve their eye movements : eye movement photography , flashmeter , metronome , and exercises designed to increase their fixation span . This group was also given some work assignments of two 15-min periods a day practicing their eye movements . In a separate group , there were 14 students who spent the same amount of time over an 8-week period reading selections of measured difficulty while attempting to increase their speed of comprehension . In this group , no mechanical devices were used and no mention of eye movements was made . This latter group also had more homework ; they were required to read a full novel each week and keep records of ' the times they read . Furthermore , they were also required to submit book reports when they finished each book . The students were divided into the two matched groups so their pretest means were equal , about 284 wpm and 93% comprehension . At the end of the course , the eye movement group read at 340 wpm with 85% comprehension , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seemingly , these data eliminated any need for mechanical equipment or eye movement training because the comprehension group read at a rate that was 41% faster and had a higher comprehension score . However , there was absolutely no description of how comprehension was measured . Given this No-Test-Description Pitfall it is impossible to evaluate the results . Since the comprehension group spent a great deal of time discussing books , analyzing short stories , finding main ideas , etc. , it seems more than possible that the instructor for the course taught the comprehension group how to go fast and still be able to answer the kinds of comprehension questions he wrote . Without even any indication that the questions were objective , these data must he disregarded . Glock ( 1949 ) compared three RRT methods with each other . One method was the Harvard Films which projects material on to a screen in phrases at varying rates . Another method used the same Harvard Film material except it was projected two lines at a time . The third method was the same Harvard Film material presented in printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many different tests , pre and post , and concluded that l'he efficiency of the method varied with the criterion and teacher used , " and " no single method was best for all teachers " ( p. 105 ) . Since there was no control group , these results can not be used to evaluate the effectiveness of RRT . Cosper and Mills ( 1953 ) reported data they had collected from several classes in developmental reading . They had administered the Diagnostic 18 . RAPID READING TRAINING / 3 8 7 Reading Tests , Survey Section ( DRT ) . This test measures reading rate from a count of the number of words read in the first passage during the first 3 min of the test . There is no comprehension measure directly associated with the words read during this first 3 min so this research failed to avoid the Rate-Measurement Pitfall . This test seems to be a little worse than the Nelson ? Denny for evaluating RRT because , as noted earlier , the comprehension score on the Nelson ? Denny does provide a roughly valid index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score , but the DRT comprehension score comes from the sum of the number correct on two slightly different 20-item subtests so it is not as technically sound as the Nelson ? Denny . It should be noted that the above research of Cosper and Mills also succumbed to the Efficiency-Index Pitfall . The DRT comprehension score declined from the beginning to the end of three semesters and it improved trivially from 30.6 to 31.4 the fourth semester . Therefore , the rauding efficiency level of these students probably did not improve . However , the authors did not fail to conclude that : " the results of two years of instruction in reading at Purdue clearly demonstrate that students can learn to read much faster with the same amount of comprehension " ( p. 360 ) . There was no recognition that the rate measure had no corresponding measure of comprehension and there was no recognition that the comprehension score was a valid index indicating the students showed no improvement in reading efficiency . It should also be noted that data from the Iowa Silent Reading Test was also reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test makes an attempt to measure the comprehension that is associated with one minute reading rate measures . However , there is no correction for guessing on the items that cover the entire passage even though some students may only finish reading the first quarter . Without a correction for guessing it is quite possible and likely that the induced skimming process at the end of RRT will result in all the items being answered but a lower percentage of the items answered correctly . Therefore , the lowered accuracy of comprehension associated with a skimming process will not be detected by this test . Cosper and Mills report higher percentile ranks at the end of the course compared to the beginning of the course on six different scores taken from the Iowa test . However , the average gain of 21 they reported in percentile rank units could easily result from taking the test twice or from only the more motivated students staying in the course until the end . Without a control group these data can not be taken seriously as support for the efficiency of RRT . Killen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults which involved an I8-hour course spread over 5 weeks ; it was 3 8 8 / IV . RELATED FACTORS primarily devoted to increasing rate using the Harvard Reading Films and a tachistoscope . They used the Robinson ? Hall Reading Tests . Before reporting the results from Kallen and Kyser , it should be noted that use of the Robinson ? Hall Test avoids the two major pitfalls associated with the Nelson ? Denny and the Diagnostic Reading Test , namely the Rate-Measure Pitfall and the Efficiency-Index Pitfall . On the Robinson ? Hall Test , students are given a lengthy article to read and after 10 min they are stopped . They record the line they were reading , and the number of words up to this point determines their reading rate . They are then given the test items , and asked to answer only the ones relevant to the material they have read . The score is the percentage of items answered correctly out of those attempted up to the point where the individual stopped reading . Therefore , this test measures percentage comprehension , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for indicating accuracy of comprehension , A , and rate of comprehension , R. Kallen and Kyser reported the scores on the Robinson ? Hall Test for 73 adults who participated in their program . On the pretest , they read at 231 wpm with a 75.5% accuracy of comprehension score . On the posttest , they read at 322 wpm with a 72.8% score . So , the rate score increased by 40% and the accuracy score decreased by 3% . It is possible that the accuracy score may have dropped further if there had not been a practice effect or a difference in forms of the test . A control group would help sort out these effects , and these researchers did mention rate scores on the Robinson ? Hall for a control group . Unfortunately , they gave no description of the control group ; it is a mystery as to how they got them , who they were , or even how many were in the group . Furthermore , they neglected to report the accuracy scores for the control group . Such data can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morton ( 1959 ) conducted one of the most thorough investigations of RRT ever published ; he avoided all of the pitfalls noted earlier . The subjects were 65 adults ranging from 21 to 63 years old who were executives in the headquarters of the General Post Office in England . The course is described below using excerpts from the report : The course investigated was a commercial Reading Efficiency course , based on the Harvard Reading Course , designed by Perry and Whitlock .... This series of films allow the projection on a screen of what is , in effect , the page of a book , revealing only a certain number of words on a line at a time so t hat , in principle , the reader 's eye is led across each line in a series of regular jumps . The films act as pacing devices , forcing the reader to conceit'rate and pre venting him from regressing . They are supposed to increase his perceptual span , i.e. , the number of words absorbed at one fixation , and hence decrease 18 . RAPID READING TRAINING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given time . For the most part , instruction in new techniques takes the form of exhortations to the students to press on ' with their reading , to avoid regression and to try to take more at a single glance . Throughout the course students are urged to practice assiduously at home and in work and much of the effect of the course is thought to depend upon this practice . ( p. 223 ) Training exercises in skimming were also given and one 700-word passage was administered to each class with a comprehension test given after the timed reading . The course was taught twice a week for 6 weeks . The 65 subjects were divided into two matched groups . The experimental group was tested before the course and a week after completion . The control group was tested during the same interval but did not take the course until after a second testing . It may be noted that this is an excellent design but one that is seldom found in the literature ; twice as many subjects are accepted as can be treated , with one-half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thereby acting as a control group . Each subject in Morton 's study was individually administered three different experimental tests , each with two matched passages that were counterbalanced . The passages for each test were over 1000 words in length . The questions on the passages were administered orally and answered orally . Excerpts below partially describe the testing . The questions covered the whole of the passage in some detail , paying more attention to the ideas expressed than the facts . ( p. 225 ) In a way it might be more accurate to say that the passage was discussed . This may seem to be highly subjective and inaccurate method of testing and was certainly more difficult than any other method since , for example , a subject might answer three of four questions at once , sometimes in an indirect way . ( p. 225 ) From the reading tests come two measures : the time taken to complete the passage , and the percentage comprehended and reproduced .... Comprehension was measured as the percentage of the ideas or facts in the article , relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . The most satisfactory and realistic measure would seem to be one of efficiency , this being defined as the product of speed and comprehension .... ( p. 226 ) The design and procedures used by Morton were exemplary , even though the testing was questionable due to the uncertain amount of subjectivity that could easily creep in , especially when the examiners probably knew at the time of testing which group each subject was in . Nonetheless , it is commendable that Morton would go to such great lengths to develop tests that had a great deal of external validity . Many of Morton 's experimental procedures were exquisite but his data analysis was frustratingly inadequate . First , he calculated his efficiency scoes . ' Flirt , he submitted them to two conversions that cantou3 9 0 / IV . RELATED FACTORS Haged any direct interpretations of his results . One conversion involved the use of standard scores that had a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 20 . The other conversion involved calculating a ratio of the experimental group mean divided by the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above conversions could be followed with ease but all three left a mystery as to what the data represented . For example , he reported no reading rates . He reported a 54% improvement in each of all three tests as a result of taking the course . Two of the tests were also given 6 months after the course was over . There was still a 30% and 35% advantage to having taken the course , 6 months later . Taken at face value , these data of Morton 's seem to suggest that rauding rate can be increased 30 ? 50% as a result of taking a 6-week course in RR'l ' . Several factors temper this interpretation , however . First , we have no idea how fast these subjects read before the course . Suppose these subjects read at a typical rate of college students found by Taylor ( 1965 ) , i.e. , 280 wpm . A 30% increase would be 364 wpm . It is conceded that a 13% variation in rate is quite normal ( see Carver , 1983 ) . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour or two each clay may have in fact increased the rauding rate of these subjects by 10 ? 20% . It is also conceded that extra concentration on going a little faster can probably increase speed by 10 ? 20% without any loss of comprehension . Second , even this amount of gain , 30% , is suspect given the following comments from Morton 's report : Many of the students in the present course were hesitant in applying the new techniques to important , difficult or lengthy material . But when the new techniques amount primarily to little more than increased concentration and more active ' reading , it is difficult to see any rational basis for their hesitancy .... ( p.234 ) The above remarks suggest that even the long-term gain of 30% is suspect because the students were " hesitant " to read this way except under special circumstances . It seems quite likely that what is being taught is a skimming skill that involves concentrating upon moving the eyes a little faster without regressing even when sentence understanding suffers . If this is a reasonable explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to see why they would not want to use this skill when reading anything " important " because of the negative consequences associated with the failure to understand and remember " important " textual information . It is equally easy to see how they would not feel comfortable using this newly learned skimming process when the material was difficult because they would be comprehending such a small percentage of the materials . Finally , it is also easy to see why they would not want to // apply this newly learned skimming process on lengthy material because they would fatigue fast when concentrating so intensely in order to operate this process . If you want to walk 5 miles , it is probably best if you do not concentrate on walking as fast as you possibly can . Instead , you will probably arrive at your destination faster and in better physical condition if you walk at your normal walking pace . Similarly , if you want to rand a lengthy article , it is probably best if you use your rauding process rather than a skimming process because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you will also be in better physical condition when you have accomplished that goal . In summary , the data collected by Morton suggest that RR ' 1 ' can induce subjects to move from their regular rauding process which operates at around 280 wpm to a skimming process which operates at around 364 Wpm . Morton 's data taken at face value suggest that there is a permanent increase in reading efficiency of 30-50% . Yet , it seems difficult to believe that subjects have experienced a permanent increase iii their rauding rate of 30-50% , especially when Morton reports that subjects are hesitant to use their newly learned skill when the material is important , difficult , or lengthy . Instead , it seems more likely that the increase in efficiency that Morton found is due solely to an increase in concentration associated with operating a skimming process that in fact is less efficient in terms of comprehending sentences but Morton 's testing was not sensitive to this loss in efficiency . Finally , the subjective nature of Morton 's testing was troublesome to say the least . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with skimming training . He gave 25 college students perceptual training that involved a tachistoscope and a reading accelerator . The skimming group of 17 was given practice in learning to skim or " pre-read . " On the Diagnostic Reading Pest , both groups gained approximately the same amount ; the perceptual group increased their rate 21% from 219 to 264 wpm , and the skimming group increased their rate 29% , from 210 to 271 wpm . On the comprehension section of the test , each group changed very little . The perceptual group gained 1.5 , from 26.6 to 28.1 , and the skimming group gained 0.9 from 26.3 to 27.2 , the two gains being 3% and 3% , respectively . Remember that this comprehension score is a roughly valid index of reading efficiency so the evidence indicated that neither group improved their reading efficiency more than trivially ( 3% ) in spite of participating in three 50-min training sessions weekly for 8 weeks . In Laffitte 's discussion of his results it was clear that he succumbed to the Efficiency-Index Pitfall . His research has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to recognize that RRT is really skimming training , and his results indicated that training 3 9 2 / IV . RELATED FACTORS which concentrated on the perceptual aspects of reading produced results that were no different from skimming training . Maxwell ( 1965 ) investigated the effect of telling students to read faster . Her design provided controls for possible differences due to test forms , order of administration , and order of experimental condition . The Robinson ? Hall Reading Test was administered to 104 college students under two conditions , normal and fast . Under the fast condition , the students were asked to " read as fast as possible without loss of comprehension " ( p. 181 ) . The rate scores under the normal and fast conditions were 219 and 256 , respectively ; the corresponding accuracy scores were 71% and 67% . Notice that simply asking these students to read faster resulted in a 17% increase in rate and a 4% decrease in accuracy . After giving these 104 students two forms of the test , Maxwell then divided them into an experimental group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a handout describing techniques for improving reading speed and told to practice these techniques daily for one hour " ( p. 184 ) , during the next week . Both groups were tested again at the end of a week with a third form of the Robinson ? Hall . At the posttest session , both groups were instructed to read the material as fast as they could . Compared to the scores under the original fast condition , the control group increased their rate 11% to 286 wpm , and the experimental group increased their rate 19% to 304 wpm . However , the control group increased their accuracy score 4% while the experimental group had a 0% gain in their accuracy score . It should also be noted that the control group increased its rate 31% over the original normal test condition while its accuracy score decreased 1% ( from 71 to 70 ) , and the corresponding changes for the experimental group were a 39% increase in rate with a 3% loss in accuracy ( from 71 to 68 ) . These data , from one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can simply be asked to go faster on a test and they will increase their rate 17% with a loss in the accuracy score of only 4% . College students can be asked twice to go faster on the Robinson ? Hall Test , and they can increase their rate 31% with only a 1% loss in the accuracy of comprehension score . Notice that these gains have been made without RRT on one of the best tests available . Furthermore , college students can be ( a ) asked to go fast , ( b ) given a handout describing techniques for reading fast , and ( c ) asked to practice reading fast , and they can make gains of 39% in rate with only a 3% loss in accuracy scores . These data suggest that the effectiveness of a program for RRT needs to be compared to these gains on the Robinson ? Hall Reading ' lest when there was little or no training . Maxwell and Mueller ( 1967 ) compared three groups that had been 18 . RAPID READING TRAINING / 3 9 3 given different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their research , they noted that Laycock ( 1955 ) reported " that students requested to read a passage as fast as possible without sacrificing comprehension ' showed a 40 percent gain over their previous tested reading rate " ( p. 184 ) . Maxwell and Mueller administered two forms of the Robinson ? Hall Reading Tests 1 week apart to three separate groups of college students , 40 per group . After the first test had been administered each group was given different instructions . The techniques group was given a handout that described " causes of slow reading ( regression , vocalization , etc. ) and explained several techniques for improving rate ( e.g. , conscious forcing of one to read faster , using a card or one 's finger as a pacer , using a Z-pattern in reading down a page , etc. ) " and they were instructed to " practice these techniques and to return the following week " ( p. 187 ) . The placebo group was " given a handout designed to motivate them to read faster by extolling the benefits of rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to follow in increasing their reading rate " ( p. 186 ) , and was told to return the following week . The control group was simply asked to return the following week . This research appears to have avoided all the pitfalls . Maxwell and Mueller reported the following rate changes , pre to post , on the Robinson ? Hall : techniques group , 240 to 328 wpm for a 37% gain ; placebo group , 250 to 278 wpm for a 11% gain ; control group , 268 to 290 wpm , for an 8% gain . The techniques group gained 37% by simply being given a handout on rapid reading theory and asked to practice during the subsequent week . This result replicated the 39% gain found by Maxwell ( 1965 ) , discussed earlier . The pre and post percentage comprehension scores were as follows : techniques group , 69.8 to 68.2 for a 2% loss ; placebo group , 71.8 to 71.5 for a 0% loss ; control group , 73.0 to 73.6 for a 1% gain . Maxwell and Mueller further analyzed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practiced the technique more , gained more . Those who tried the methods once or twice during the week gained just as much as those who tried the methods every day . These data suggest that students can be told a little of the theory behind RRT and that is enough to get some of them to try out a skimming process that is 37% faster . Furthermore , the best available test ( at that time ) showed no important loss in the accuracy of comprehension . However , this 37% increase in rate with a 2% loss in accuracy should be compared to earlier data collected by Maxwell ( 1965 ) . She found a 31% increase in rate with a 1% loss in accuracy for a control group who was simply told to go read faster on this same test . When this comparison is made , the gain of 1 he techniques group seems inconsequential . 3 9 4 / IV . RELA ! ED FACTORS There are several points that should be kept in mind when interpreting the Maxwell and Mueller data . First , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wpm , but the 328 wpm was only 13% faster than the control group which read 290 wpm on the posttest . Second , both the 290 wpm for the control group and the 328 wpm for the group that received RRT are well within the range expected for the rauding process . Third , the techniques group read 13% faster than the control group on the posttest , but it also comprehended 5% less , 68.2 versus 73.6% . Fourth , it is expecting too much from the Robinson ? Hall Test for it to register a 13% decrement iii the accuracy of comprehension when there is a 13% increase in the rate of comprehension . Fifth , these gains in RRT resulted from training which consisted of a handout describing how to read fast and asking students to practice reading fast over a 1-week period . In summary , these data from Maxwell and Mueller can be reasonably interpreted as indicating that students can be induced to read faster by telling them about the theory underlying RRT but their increase in rate and their loss in accuracy of comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test twice and were asked to read fast each time . Berger ( 1968a ) compared four methods of improving reading rate , comprehension , and flexibility . The four methods were ( a ) tachistoscope , ( b ) controlled reader , ( c ) control pacing , and ( d ) paperback scanning . This study appeared to be well designed , given the accepted limitations of a quasi-experimental design . A reasonably comparable control group was included . Berger 's primary conclusion was that " the paperback scanning method produced the most significant results over the other methods ... " ( p. 596 ) . Unfortunately , the statistical significance pitfall was not avoided . Only tests of statistical significance were reported in four tables ; there were no rates or comprehension scores reported . Swaim and Kling ( 1973 ) gave RRT to pupils in grades 5 and 6 . The 38 students in the experimental group were given timed reading drills and the 38 students in the control group were given free reading time equal to the amount of time devoted to rate instruction in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks with three 30-min periods each week . The Diagnostic Reading Test , DRT , and the Van Wagenen Rate of Comprehension Scale were pre- and post-administered . On the DRT , the experimental group increased their rate from 153 to 403 wpm , for a 163% gain , while the control group increased their rate from 149 to 180 wpm for a 21% gain . Remember , these gains in rate on the DRT represent the Rate-Measurement Pitfall . On the comprehension part of the DRT , both groups gained I% pre to post t hereby 18 . RAPID READING " TRAINING / 3 9 5 indicating that the RRT had not been successful in improving reading efficiency . This is another example of the Efficiency-Index Pitfall . One reason for reviewing this study is that it used a type of reading rate test , the Van Wagenen , not discussed before . This test plus the Chapman ? Cook and the Tinker Speed of Reading Test are all examples of tests that contain easy to read sentences with a word changed toward the end of very short paragraphs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible and still be able to mark out correctly the anomalous word in as many items as possible during the time limit . These tests provide relatively good indices of reading rate but the scores are not in units of wpm but items correctly marked . In this Swalm and Kling study , the experimental group had a pre ? post gain on the Van Wagenen of 21% and the control group had a corresponding gain of 14% . On another informal test that was given , the experimental group had a 15% lower comprehension score . Swalm and Kling interpreted their data as follows : " No clear picture of the effect of rate training on comprehension emerged from the study " ( p. 163 ) . It is also possible to recognize the Efficiency-Index Pitfall and interpret these data as providing no support for the efficacy of RRT . R. G. Graf ( 1973 ) investigated the speed and comprehension of a group of 31 students who took RRT from a private firm . Pre and post tests were administered to these students and also to 31 students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed on passages that ranged from 1683 to 1817 words in length . The passages were taken from Doctor Zhivago , a Playboy article , a Redbook article , and an experimental psychology book . Over the four articles , the speed readers increased their rate pre ? post from 216 to 695 wpm for a 222% gain and the control group increased from 258 to 285 wpm for a 10% gain . On the comprehension tests , the speed readers went from 66% to 40% for a 26% loss in the accuracy of comprehension . This study appears to have avoided all the pitfalls associated with evaluating RRT , and it found a major loss in the accuracy of comprehension , A , associated with the major increase in rate , R. Brown and McDowell ( 1979 ) reported upon the rate and accuracy of comprehension of 70 college students before and after they had taken a reading improvement course . The pre- and post-tests consisted of articles and questions taken from a reading improvement textbook . Rate increased tremendously from 257 to 1956 wpm while percentage comprehension dropped only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this study is to illustrate the Skimming-Items Pitfall . There is no evidence that the test questions taken front this hook , primarily used to induce people to read faster , arc sensitive to the loss iii the accuracy of 3 9 6 / IV . RELATED FACTORS comprehension that is ordinarily associated with increases in rate . Without such evidence , it must be assumed that the questions are skimming questions that can be answered just as well at 400 ? 500 wpni as they can at 250 ? 300 wpm . CONCLUSIONS Of all the studies of RRT reviewed , it appears that the only studies that met minimum standards and avoided all of the known pitfalls were the following : Bridges ( 1941 ) ; R. G. Graf ( 1973 ) ; Maxwell and Mueller ( 1967 ) ; Morton ( 1959 ) . The Bridges study was notable because emphasizing speed in a group of elementary students in fact got them going faster but their comprehension scores went down considerably compared to the other groups . The Morton study was notable for its elaborate description of experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformations , and its 30% long-term improvement in reading efficiency measures . The Maxwell and Mueller study was notable for finding a 37% improvement in rate after a treatment that consisted of a handout taken home ; it was also notable that after the treatment the RRT group read 13% faster than the controls and comprehended 5% less . The Graf study was notable for its 26% loss in the accuracy of comprehension associated with taking a commercially available speed reading course . If the four studies noted above were the only ones available , then it might be difficult to make a data-based decision about the efficacy of RRT . However , there were a large number of studies of RRT , referenced earlier , in connection with the Efficiency-Index Pitfall , that used the Nelson ? Denny or the Diagnostic Reading Test and found no change or trivial differences in comprehension scores . Since these comprehension test scores do reflect reading efficiency , it is clear that there are a large amount of data that indicate that all types of RRT do not result in important gains in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , EL . The data that exist are exceptionally poor in quality but there has been enough research where the RRT groups did not do better on valid indices of reading efficiency to be reasonably confident that these RRT classes produce improvement in rauding rate that varies from zero to 5% , at best . There have also been enough data collected to he reasonably confident that most students can be easily induced to shift up to a skimming process , Gear 4 , that operates about 50% faster than the rauding process , Gear 3 . Furthermore , it appears that it is possible to induce students to adopt such a skimming process in a matter of minutes or a few hours ; there is no evidence that it is necessary for college stu18. // dents to spend several hours on instruction or practice before they will adopt a skimming process that is 50% faster than their rauding process . It should be possible to develop a screening test to locate individuals who need skimming training . Students would be asked to read at a rate that is about twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overview , and then ask them both skimming-type questions and **26;779;TOOLONG questions . Under these conditions , those students who do not read at least 50% faster , who do not answer at least 75% of the skimming items correctly , and who do answer more than 75% of the sentence comprehension questions correctly are likely candidates for skimming training . In summary , rauding theory holds that rauding rate , R , , is relatively constant and probably can only be improved by those people who do not regularly raud relatively easy materials . Some researchers , some theorists , and some laypersons seem to think that anyone can improve their rauding rate by 50 ? 300% from RRT . There is no valid research evidence to support this claim despite the fact that there has been a great deal of research on RRT . Almost all of the published research is seriously flawed by one or more pitfalls that render the results invalid . However , since there have been many studies that found no gain in the comprehension section of standardized reading tests , this constitutes strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate that RRT produced no gain in reading efficiency . If rate actually increased in these studies , then accuracy had to decrease , otherwise efficiency could not have remained constant . Almost all RRT is really skimming training in disguise . Over 60 years ago , Judd and Buswell ( 1922 ) gave some salient advice that was quoted earlier and will be quoted again . They said " nor is there any more dangerous habit to acquire than that of skimming " ( p. 152 ) . It is dangerous to get into the habit of using a faster and less powerful skimming process when the rauding process is required to comprehend accurately the complete thoughts in sentences . I19 SPEED READERS AND SUPER READERS INTRODUCTION Are there individuals who can read at 1000 words per minute , or faster , and still comprehend 75% or more of the complete thoughts in relatively easy material ? Can speed readers do this ? How fast can individuals successfully operate their rauding process ? This chapter will review the research relevant to exceptionally good readers and speed readers , i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still accurately comprehend what they are reading . First , however , a section will be devoted to measuring the degree of individual differences in reading rate so that the subsequent research can be placed in context . Then , the review of relevant research will be presented , followed by conclusions . INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES Earlier , in Chapter 2 , the average rate of rauding at each grade level was presented in Table 2.1 . For example , the mean rate for college readers found by Taylor ( 1965 ) was 280 wpm which was estimated to be 286 Wpm . These data , however , do not reflect upon how much college students vary among themselves with respect to reading rate . Some measure of variation is needed . In the 1981 Examiner 's Manual for the Nelson ? Denny Reading Test , the means and standard deviations ( sips ) for rate are given for Form E and Form F from an equating study . The two means for college seniors were 300 wpm and 290 wpm , and the two sus were 103 and 81 , respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a special way of averaging ( i.e. , the quadratic mean ) the deviations around the arithmetic mean . Assuming a normal distribution with a mean of 300 Wpm and a . tit ) of 4 0 2 / V. THE LAST PART about 90 Wpm , 16% of the college seniors would read faster than 390 Wpm and 2% would read faster than 480 Wpm . From the normative data given for Form E , less than 1% of college seniors reported that they read faster than 600 wpm on the Nelson ? Denny Reading Test . As noted in Chapters 13 and 18 , these reading rates on the Nelson ? Denny are self-reported from the first one minute of reading and there is no comprehension check on what was read . Therefore , there is nothing to prevent a college senior who has a rauding rate of 300 Wpm frorn shifting up to a skimming process or a scanning process that operates at 600 Wpm during this first one minute . Also , there is nothing to prevent a lower ability college senior , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one minute . So , the variability in these reading rates on the Nelson ? Denny is probably larger than the variability in rauding rates because variability is exaggerated by some students operating in Gear 4 or Gear 5 with higher reading rates and by some students operating in Gear 1 or Gear 2 with lower reading rates . With this background , it seems safe to conclude that individuals who have rauding rates that are 600 Wpm or higher are either nonexistent or exceptionally rare ; if such individuals exist they can be called super readers . Yet , reported reading rates at 600 Wpm or higher would not provide evidence of a super reader because many individuals can operate a scanning process or a skimming process at 600 Wpm or higher . There must be some evidence that the individual was accurately comprehending ( A #@# 0.75 ) the complete thoughts in the sentences of the passages . Stated differently , there must be some evidence that an individual has a rauding rate of 600 Wpm or higher before the existence of a super reader can be acknowledged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no sound evidence that the rauding process was being successfully operated , should not be interpreted as evidence of a super reader . The following quotation , taken from Morse et al . ( 1968 ) , provides some interesting historical information regarding the fast reading speed of the distinguished educational psychologist , Professor Edward L. Thorndike , of Columbia University : Professor Thorndike has been credited by Time magazine with having read the Cyclopedia of Education as bedtime reading . Professor Walter F. Dearborn , of Harvard University , has recently obtained some eye-movement records of Professor Thorndike 's reading by means of the electrical-potential technique . Dr. Dearborn has given the present writer permission to use the section of Professor Thorndike 's electro-oculogram shown on Figure 8 . The reading material in this case was a selection from Adam Smith 's Wealth o/ Nations . A comprehension check was required . A rough estimate of Professor Thorn 19 . SPEED READERS AND SUPER READERS / 4 0 3 dike 's performance , as illustrated on Figure 14 , indicates that he was reading at about 560 words per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With Professor ' Thorndike 's record to supplement the eye-movement records obtained from the subjects of this investigation , it seems clear that even the most omnivorous of readers do not read with the lightning rates commonly reported , especially when they are asked to make good their performance on a comprehension check test . ( p. 167 ) It appears that Professor Thorndike was an exceptionally good reader , but there was no evidence that he could read faster than 600 Wpm and still accurately comprehend . In summary , finding individuals who can consistently comprehend more than 75% of what they are reading while operating their rauding process at a rate higher than 600 Wpm would constitute evidence that super readers existed . Without sound evidence that the sentences in previously unread material were being accurately comprehended , the conclusion would have to be that the high rates reflected the operation of a skimming or a scanning relationship . RESEARCH Adelaide M. Abell ( 1894 ) collected reading rate data from 41 members of a Wellesley psychology class . She appears to be the first to conduct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is the primary reason for referring to her research . Unfortunately , she measured reading time and it was not possible to determine rate in wpm since she did not report the length of the " short story " she asked these students to read . Dearborn ( 1906 ) published an extensive study of eye movements ( over 130 pages in length ) , and he reported the reading rates of eight subjects in words per 20 seconds . These eight subjects were selected for this part of his research because they were the fastest four and slowest four out of a group of 30 . Reading rates were given for nine different passages taken from Robinson Crusoe . The average reading rate for the fastest reader in this group was 654 wpm . Random samples of lines from Robinson Crusoe produced an average of 5.1 characters per word which is D , = 1.3 ; Equation ( 2.1 ) was applied and the result was 546 Wpm . This means that the fastest reader that Dearborn could find read an easy and familiar children 's book at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he the first researcher to refer to the " rapid reader . " King ( I 91(i) appears to be the first to conduct an experiment that induced individuals to read faster than what he called their " natural Tate . " Out of 91 university students , lie randomly assigned half to a 4 0 4 / v. THE LAST PART group that was paced to cover more of an article while the other half was paced to cover less of the article . From his grading of the test questions relevant to the material they covered , the " fasts " answered 45.7% correctly and the " slows " answered 53.3% correctly . Thus , in 1916 we have the first evidence that rapid reading results in a decrease in accuracy of comprehension . This article is mostly of historical interest because ( a ) there was no measure of rate in wpm , ( b ) there was very little description of the test questions , and ( c ) the grading appeared to be very subjective . W. R. Dixon ( 1951 ) reported upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they read passages in three subject matter areas , education , physics , and history . ( Note : This research was also reviewed earlier in Chapters 5 and 10 from a different perspective . ) These readers should be among the best in the world since doing well in their chosen area of work in academics requires high reading proficiency . There were no important differences in rate between professors and graduate students . The 32 professors and graduate students in education read at a mean rate of 300.2 Wpm , the 32 in physics read at a mean rate of 300.5 Wpm , and those 32 in history read at a mean rate of 317.3 Wpm . From these data , it appears that the average college professor and average graduate student have a rauding rate level at about R , , = 16 , from the equation presented in Chapter 11 . For the above research , the standard deviations were averaged from the data presented , and these resulting SDS were 89.0 Wpm for education , 77.1 Wpm for physics , and 92.2 Wpm for history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 103 presented earlier in this chapter for college seniors . Out of these 96 exceptionally good readers , only five read at least one of the three eight grade level selections ( Dr = 8 ) faster than 500 Wpm , and none read a passage faster than 600 Wpm . Of these five fastest readers , only one maintained a rate of 500 Wpm or faster on all three passages , on history , education , and physics . Dixon described this latter individual as follows : Case 13 happens to be the individual who has the reputation on the University of Michigan campus of being able to read a line or a paragraph at a glance . One will search the record shown for this case . . . in vain for evidence of single eye-fixations per line or paragraph . ( p. 166 ) These data from exceptionally good readers who are reading relatively easy material further corroborate the assumption made earlier that a rauding rate greater than 600 Wpm would be indicative of a super reader , yet none have been found . Thomas ( 1962 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPEED READERS AND SUPER READERS / 4 0 5 reader while he was covering pages at about 10,000 wpm . A close reading of this report , however , reveals that there was no check on the accuracy of comprehension following reading . Since individuals can skip over words at almost any rate , the crucial question is whether such individuals can do what F. Smith ( 1971 ) claims they can do , namely , " comprehend an entire page from the same number of features that a normally skilled reader might require to read barely a tenth of the words " ( p. 204 ) . In the Thomas research , the only reference made to comprehension was the following statement : " No tests of comprehension were made ... but S was tested on a later occasion by Dr. Russell Stauffer , and showed good comprehension " ( p. 105 ) . Such a lack of scientific rigor is breathtaking , and does not constitute satisfactory evidence of a super reader . Taylor ( 1962 ) studied 41 trainees who had taken Evelyn Wood 's speed ' reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an education background of what might be considered equivalent to a master 's degree , " and " had served in administrative or teaching capacities " ( p. 41 ) . The course was taught by Evelyn Wood herself . The eye movements of the group were photographed before and after the course . It was reported that " the trainees increased their average rate from 474 to 564 w.p.m. , an increase of 90 w.p.m. , or 20% " ( p. 43 ) . It was also reported that the average comprehension before the course was 78% and after the course it was 81% . Short passages were used in the collection of the preceding data . After the course , " the trainees were given an opportunity to read dynamically ' in a book " ( p. 45 ) . Their average rates in this testing were above 1000 Wpm but the average comprehension reported was only about 50% . Taylor summarized his results as follows : In summary , an analysis of these eye-movements photographs shows that the gain exhibited by these seemingly above-average trainees was comparatively slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be , in part , attributed to drive and motivation during the testing , and that when they attempted to read " dynamically , " they appeared to resort to a skimming and scanning-like process , with a substantial loss of comprehension . ( p.55 ) These data leave little doubt that when individuals speed read at rates above 1000 wpm , they are operating a skimming process . However , the pre and post average rates of 474 Wpm and 564 Wpm with 78% and 81% comprehension scores respectively call into question the earlier assertion that rauding rates greater than 600 Wpm are exceptionally rare or nonexistent . Unfortunately , there was no SD reported as a measure of variability , and there was no description of the tests or procedures used to measure comprehension . Before accepting the idea that there are super readers who have rending rates above 600 Wpm , it would be neces406 / V. THE LAST PART sary to have a better description of the procedures and measures used for rate and comprehension . Adams ( 1963 ) stated that out of 2000 individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read at or above a rate of 1500 words per minute ( wpm ) and had comprehension at or above 70% . These 12 sound like super readers . In this research study , the individuals reported when they had finished reading a given passage . The reading rates were determined from their self-reported times . The individuals were also allowed to grade their own answer sheets . Adams urged scientists who doubted that anyone could read over 1000 wpm to accept these data as factual and to modify their theories accordingly . This is an ineffectual argument . Out of these 2000 studied by Adams , it is not unreasonable to assume that the 12 who were above 1500 wpm included the following : two outright forgers , two who copied from their neighbors , two who made honest mistakes in their grading , two who reported an early finish and then went back and actually finished , and four who reported lower scores but whose data were mistakenly recorded in the transfer of data from the test . " These data leave much to be desired in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Adams was 90% reading comprehension at the rate of 17,040 wpm . One might have expected that there would have been a thorough search to find this individual because she or he would seem to have abilities that make the rest of us appear closer to apes in brain functioning . Again , these data can not be interpreted as documenting the existence of super readers . Carver ( 1972a ) investigated the tests that have been used to measure comprehension during speed reading . The tests were used in a research study described by Evelyn Wood ( 1963 ) as follows : At the University of Delaware , a careful study of the Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamic technique was made by William Liddle , a Ph.D . candidate , using a control and an experimental group . In reading non-fiction , he found no significant differences in comprehension between the two groups , despite the fact that the experimental group read at 1300 Wpm ? better than three times the speed of the control group . ( p. 44 ) Carver ( 1972a ) noted that in this unpublished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , nonfiction and fiction , and that the speed readers had lower comprehension scores than the controls on both nonfiction and fiction . For nonfiction , the control readers had a 72% comprehension score and the speed readers were lower at 68% ; this was the difference that Wood ( 1963 ) mentioned as not being statistically significant . Carver hypothesized that the reason why the difference was 19 . SPEED READERS AND SUPER READERS / 4 0 7 not larger for the nonfiction materials was because the test was insensitive to comprehension decrements ; the test was probably composed of skimming items as was discussed earlier in Chapter 18 . Carver investigated his hypothesis about the test containing skimming items by administering the questions to a small group ( N = 6 ) , who were not allowed to read the passages before they took the tests . He found that under this control condition , 57% of the nonfiction questions were answered correctly and 51% of the fiction questions were answered correctly . Notice that the speed readers were able to answer only 11% more of the nonfiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they were able to answer only 17% more of the fiction questions . The above data collected by Carver invalidate the assertion by Wood ( 1963 ) that speed readers can read at 1300 wpm and still comprehend just as much ' as normal readers do when they read at rates well below 600 wpm . The speed readers were undoubtedly operating a skimming process and most of the test questions used to measure comprehension could be answered after skimming , or without reading at all . Again , these data can not be interpreted as establishing the existence of super readers . Cranney , Brown , Hansen , and Inouye ( 1982 ) compared a small group of speed readers ( N = 5 ) to two control groups while reading chapters in a social psychology textbook . One control group consisted of six graduate students in social psychology , called the informed group , and the other control group consisted of six honors undergraduates who had no background in social psychology , called the uninformed group . Each of these three groups ( experimental , informed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power condition , they were paced to read each page at an average rate of 260 wpm . Under the speed condition , they were paced to read each page at an average rate of 3000 wpm . Under the preferred rate condition , they read each page at their own preferred rate . After reading a chapter each of the above three ways ( power , speed , and preferred ) they were allowed to write down notes on what they could recall . Then , they were allowed to go back to the chapter again . Finally , they were allowed to take additional notes , without referring back . Then , they were asked to record on a cassette tape " an organized , detailed summary that reflected as much as they could recall about the chapter just read " ( p. 528 ) . It was pointed out that the speed readers in the experimental group had taken the Reading Dynamics course where they ( a ) had been taught to use the hand as a pacer , ( b ) had been taught a note-taking technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) had been laugh ' 1 ( 1 read faster using a technique called " add-a-page drill . " After these data had been collected , the tape-recorded recalls were scored by 408 / V. THE LAST PART having judges evaluate " comprehension as percent of the total material recalled " ( p. 529 ) . The results of the above research by Cranney et al . will be presented for each of the three reading conditions ; the reading rates to be reported have been adjusted to include the extra time spent reading after the first note-taking session . Under the power reading condition , the rates for the speed readers , informed readers , and uninformed readers were 198 , 201 , and 204 wpm , respectively , and the corresponding percentage comprehension scores were 74 , 54 , and 51 . Notice that the average rates were almost exactly the same for all three groups , about 200 wpm , but the accuracy of comprehension for the speed readers , 74% , was much higher than the informed readers , 54% , which consisted of third and fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textbook in their field of social psychology . These recall data suggest that the speed readers were much better readers than the informed readers , since the speed readers could operate a learning process at the same rate as the informed readers and still comprehend 20% more even when the material was in the chosen field of study for the informed readers . The results for the uninformed readers were similar to the informed readers and did not add enough information to justify their inclusion . So , from this point on , this review will be simplified by disregarding the scores of the second control group , the uninformed readers . The above data suggest that the speed readers were either much better readers in general than the informed group , or they were much better note takers , or they were much better at organizing and verbalizing their recalls , or they were much better at all of the above . The point is , when reading fast was not important but comprehending , remembering , writing notes , organizing notes , and verbalizing recalls at a very slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than the informed readers . The size of this difference can be measured using Cohen 's d as an effect size measure ( see Carver , 1984a ) , and it turns out to be 1.65 . Cohen ( 1977 ) considers a d of 0.2 to be a small effect , 0.5 to be a medium effect , and 0.8 to be a large effect . Therefore , it can be seen that the speed readers were a great deal better at this task at 200 wpm than the informed readers since the difference between the two groups represented an extremely large effect size ( 1.65 compared to a large effect size of 0.80 ) . The five speed readers in this research were described as university students , with two being undergraduates , two being English honors students , and one being a graduate student in instructional psychology . Each of these five students had been nominated by teachers at the Reading Dynamics course because these students had successfully used the 19 . SPEED READERS AND SUPER READERS / 4 0 9 technique for at least one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , it is clear that the speed readers were a great deal better at this task than the controls , probably because they were selected to be the best out of a large group of very good readers . Under the speed condition in the Cranney et al . research , the adjusted rates for all three groups were the same , 1800 wpm ; the speed readers had a mean percentage comprehension score of 62 and the corresponding score for the informed group was 45 . Again , a very large difference showing the superiority of the speed readers . Cohen 's d was calculated to be 1.55 , which again indicates a very large effect size that is approximately equal to the effect size found under the power condition , 1.65 . In both the power condition ( about 200 wpm ) and the speed condition ( about 1800 wpm ) , the speed readers demonstrated that they were much better at performing these tasks of comprehending , remembering , taking notes , organizing notes , and verbalizing recalls . However , it seems entirely possible that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability that ( a ) loads heavily on a skill at which these five students excel , ( b ) was further emphasized in this course , and ( c ) was steadily practiced by these five students so that they are much better at this particular task than most any other group , especially unpracticed students . It would be necessary to measure the ability of these speed readers to read other material at 1800 Wpm and show that they had comprehended over 75% of the complete thoughts before jumping to the conclusion that they were super readers who have rauding rates greater than 600 Wpm . Under the preferred rate condition in this research , the speed readers and the informed readers read at 1134 wpm and 304 wpm , respectively , and the mean comprehension score for both groups was 65% . Cranney et at . interpreted this result as indicating that the speed readers can go faster ( 1134 versus 304 ) while maintaining respectable comprehension ( 65% versus 65% ) . However , the more reasonable way to interpret this result is to note that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group under both the power condition ( 200 wpm ) and the speed condition ( 1800 wpm ) lost all of their superiority when they read at 1134 wpm and the informed control group read at 304 wpm . If the speed readers had maintained their superiority in the preferred condition on the comprehension measure ( with a Cohen 's d of around 1.5 ) while reading at a rate of 1 134 Wpm , then there would have been st rung evidence that they had somehow learned to read at this high rate without sacrificing any comprehension . However , it is obvious that they sacrificed comprehension ; otherwise why slid they not show the same exceptional superiority on the comprehension score that they 4 1 0 / V. THE LAST PART showed under the power and speed conditions when both groups read at the same rate ? The above research indicates that speed readers can operate a skimming process that helps them perform well under certain study conditions . Yet , their performance suffers greatly at rates over 1000 Wpm as compared to rates around 300 wpm . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rauding , learning , and memorizing processes , as well as note taking . These data serve to showcase the kind of exceptionally good study skills that can be achieved by some exceptionally good readers , possibly with the help of a commercial course such as Reading Dynamics . However , these data do not provide sound evidence that there are individuals who can operate their rauding process at rates over 600 Wpm and still comprehend the complete thoughts in over 75% of the sentences . Homa ( 1983 ) was asked by the American Speed reading Academy ( ASA ) to test two of its graduates who supposedly could read at rates exceeding 100,000 wpm . Together with ASA , they worked out three different tests that would be given to determine the unique abilities of these two men . Two of the tests involved visual perception , and Homa found that neither of the two speed readers were better than control subjects . He summarized the perceptual results as follows : Their perceptual extent was no different from the control subjects . Their accuracy on the paragraph perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they demonstrated a much greater tendency to guess at the words presented . ( p. 126 ) Homa also gave the speed readers a 20-item multiple choice test on a chapter from a book used in one of his university classes . He had already used the same book and test in one of his classes so it was possible to assign a grade on the test using the same criteria that he had used in his class . In a class of 52 , he had assigned 10 A 's , 10 B 's , 15 C 's , 7 D 's , and 10 F 's , with anyone scoring below 14 being given an F. The two speed readers were allowed to read at their own rate , and then they were given the test . They did poorly , below 14 for an F , so he repeated the testing again , 3 ? 5 days later , and then a third time , 3 ? 5 days later . He reported that one speed reader averaged about 30,000 wpm over the three exams , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both speed readers would have been given F 's because they failed the exam . He summarized his findings as follows : " In conclusion , the only noteworthy skill exhibited by the two speed-readers was a remarkable dexterity irr pageturning " ( p. 126 ) . These data certainly do not support the existence of super readers .
