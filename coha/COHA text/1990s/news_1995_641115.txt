<p> Professor Gary Marx is a voice of reason preaching caution and vigilance on the road to the future . <p> A sociologist , Marx offers rational commentary in the midst of a silly season that saw the Windows 95 marketing lollapalooza , Time magazine 's Orwellian hissy fit on cyberporn , and the increasing angst of middle Americans as techno-mania encroaches on our lives . <p> An internationally recognized expert on surveillance and privacy in cyberspace , Marx is chairman of the sociology department at the University of Colorado and one of the founders of a communications initiative at CU designed in part to look at the problems of technology . <p> Marx is the scout sent ahead to discover what lies beyond our borders . <p> He has developed ideas about what individuals and groups might do to protect themselves from the dangers of eroding privacy . Or , as he would say , " speculate " about it - because hard data about a world that is transmuting itself nano-second by nano-second is n't available . <p> Marx , who published the seminal book on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his academic research in police " watching " to the ever-increasing " information-gathering powers of the state and private organizations . " <p> Having studied privacy and its violators for more than a decade , Marx , a Ph.D . from Berkeley , acknowledges the powers of technology but is wary of its applications . <p> " I come neither to torch technology nor to become a torch singer for its wonders , " says Marx . <p> " One need not rigidly accept Frankensteinian visions , nor become a machine-breaking Luddite to appreciate the importance of approaching the future with the caution of a flashing yellow , rather than a green light , " he says . <p> The possibility that privacy may be less protected as technology advances , its value eroding without our taking much notice , is a dominant theme of Marx 's work . <p> Marx is n't the only one pointing to the growing powers of data-gathering firms that use increasingly sophisticated and intrusive methods of collecting information . The telemarketing industry is growing about 30 percent every year , Marx said . The breadth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers , bank information , consumer habits , marital status , phone numbers and addresses . <p> The same technology that enables workers to free themselves of the office - to work at home while raising children , for instance - could change conventional telephone tapping . <p> " With a modem , a knowledgeable individual could remotely reprogram a line so that all calls are simultaneously ( and silently ) rerouted to a third line and recorded , " Marx said . <p> Reporters and felons no longer have to leave the office to obtain personal information . Public information can be easily accessed through computer data bases . <p> " Work monitoring has been taken to new heights or depths , depending on your point of view , " Marx said . " Quantity of keystroke activity , number of errors and corrections , speed of work and time away from the computer can be measured . " <p> And the capabilities of a police state grow each day . <p> An FBI advisory board recently recommended putting the names of those suspected , but not arrested , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and associates of known criminals could be in that computer as well . So far , the FBI has rejected the proposal , but Marx said that the pressure to create such national data bases is strong and growing . <p> Dependence on technology - the assumption that we are safe - also can have disastrous , unintended effects , Marx said . <p> In Los Angeles , a woman depending on police technology was killed by her estranged husband . <p> The man shot and killed the woman , who had not reported his threats to police . She assumed that she was safe because he was wearing a monitoring bracelet . <p> Marx suggests that one reason for the increase in carjackings is that it has become so hard for thieves to break into and hot-wire cars with security systems . <p> " Making it harder to break into cars causes a change in tactics , " he said . " A frustrated thief may firebomb a car on the street when he ca n't get in to get the radio . The radio is not taken , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who advises policymakers , Marx does have some suggestions for individuals to protect themselves from intrusion . He suggests that people be wary of giving out even the most innocuous information - telephone numbers , address , ages , Social Security numbers - unless the rationale is clear . <p> " Understand that every bit of that stuff goes into data bases , and you may not be happy to find your privacy has been invaded , that a marketing research company has all this stuff , " Marx said . <p> It has been more than a decade since there was a national commission to consider privacy issues . Marx suggests that another be established . Items on the agenda should include computer networks and the gathering and selling of data without individual knowledge or consent . <p> As a sociologist , Marx looks at the cultural climate , and he has pointed to a number of " techno-fallacies " that may fuel future technological travesty : <p> The fallacy of assuming that only the guilty have to fear the development of intrusive technology . " It 's not true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to hide . The reason that we have envelopes around letters , is not because it is illegal or immoral . Our sense of self and friendship are determined by control of personal information . The sharing of information is intimate . " <p> The legalistic fallacy of assuming that the only criterion that ought to guide the use of technology is whether the law permits it . " We must begin with the law as a guide , but not stop with it . Just because you have the right to do something , does n't mean that you should ( do it ) . Selling of mass marketing information has been justified by the First Amendment . Your bank records have very modest federal protection . Your bank can legally show your records to law enforcement , but many wo n't do it . " <p> The fallacy of assuming that pragmatism and efficiency should automatically overrule other values such as fairness or equity . " If you just have efficiency , you might have a society that was unkind , without compassion or fairness . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients possessed by a company can be bought and sold with impunity . " Information can hurt individuals . Subscribers to certain magazines could be marked by either those who want to sell something to them or would use their interests to hurt them . " <p> The fallacy of perfect containment - that technology always will remain the solution rather than become the problem . " Today 's solutions can become tomorrow 's problems , " Marx says . " It 's interesting that we thought that the car would be an anti-pollution device . The cure-all for the horse manure all over the cities that was causing health problems . " <p> Marx reminds us that in a free market economy , most high-tech gadgets are available to offenders . " Bulletproof vests protect criminals as well as authorities ; criminals may also encrypt their communications . And a dog in heat is a wonderful antidote to a guard dog . " <p> " Humans are wonderfully clever at finding ways to beat technical systems if they have the incentive to do so , " he said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunken driving , for example , can be beaten by releasing into it clean air saved in a balloon . <p> But Marx 's favorite computer crime story has n't got anything to do with sophisticated chicanery . <p> A thief managed to steal millions of dollars from a company whose officials thought the state-of-the-art protective devices they had installed were inviolate . <p> The criminal did n't have to hack into the system . He seduced the woman who was responsible for the codes needed to gain access to the money .
