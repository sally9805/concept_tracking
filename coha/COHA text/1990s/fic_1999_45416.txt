He was a Communist , he told her when they first met . As she shook his hand in the U.S. style of greeting , and he kissed her cheek in the Chilean , Amanda was a bit taken aback . Even among her mother 's political friends back home , it was mighty rare to hear someone come out and admit this . After he knew her for some time , he leaned over his desk in the airless human rights office , in a clutter of ripped envelopes and bent pages arching off the desk , his fingertips poised on two stacks of transcripts of interviews with torture victims , and told her , just between the two of them , he was also a practicing Catholic . A believer . <p> Gonzalo MacDonald was also very helpful . He wrote her letters of introduction to the groups of families of the disappeared and never asked her why of all places Chile , until she volunteered the information , why it always had to be Chile . He had been too young to have met her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his story , though no one was sure for exactly what alleged crime he had been disappeared . Some sort of photography , it was imagined . It was a bit of a surprise to him that her father had had a child by a gringa , which would , Gonzalo supposed , have made him politically suspect among certain companeros at the time . Amanda told him that her father seemed to have specialized in people placed within landscapes . She wanted to know what he had photographed that had gotten him in trouble , and it was unlikely that she would ever know for sure . <p> That first time , he had looked at her credentials and said , " So you 're called Amanda . " She had flinched . From the time she had arrived in Chile , she had become increasingly uncomfortable telling people that her name was Amanda because , one time in three , they would start to sing-wistfully or to tease her , either making her uncomfortable-Victor Jara 's " Te recuerdo Amanda , " the ballad of a girl whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mountains , the song after which she was in fact named , through what she considered a serious lapse in her mother 's taste that would be a nuisance for the rest of her stay in Chile . He told her he was Gonzalo MacDonald , which she already knew . <p> " Welcome , Amanda , " he said through the smile of his moustache . When he saw her relief , that she had been holding her breath , he told her , " What happened to your family is enough to explain naming a child Amanda . Almost . It 's actually a very pretty name . " <p> She knew . She was conceived , her mother had assured her , with some recipe of romantic love and political solidarity in Chile , where , her mother told her , her father had probably been tortured and had definitely been killed , most likely having gotten into trouble with one of his cameras , probably one of his beloved viewfinder Leicas , either the one he used for color or the one he preferred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twenty years of repetitive dinner table conversation and , as for many years she actually thought they were called , whine and cheeses . The music whenever possible had been Inti-Illimani 's pan flutes and Spanish guitars ( beautiful in the way that museums are beautiful , not a whole lot of fun and of course the earnest folk strummings of Victor Jara , including , until after repeated tantrums culminating in a scratch in the record , " Te recuerdo Amanda . " Far away , she had been brought up on Chile , the name of which , her mother had instructed her , was an Araucano word for the very end of the world , not as so many people in what had turned out to be her country thought , a very spicy pepper . <p> " There is also the theory of the chile bird , " Gonzalo MacDonald told her , " whose song goes , as close as we can pronounce it , chile chile chile . " <p> " Chile , chile , chile , " Amanda repeated , but shrugged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird would make . <p> " Do you know how the United States got its name ? " he asked her , and she paused to remember the history she had not studied since high school . But no , the name seemed almost to have been chosen by default , or as a compromise among former colonies that mostly seemed to have kept their old names . Before she could respond , he said , " A little pigeon in Plymouth Rock took one look at the Puritans and chirped , United States , United States , United States . " <p> Knowing who her father was , Gonzalo all but apologized for having spent only a year in prison , apologized to her , who had never even done detention in grade school , never even fought back or had a witty reply when , growing up in Philadelphia , where blessedly few had ever heard of the singer-songwriter Victor Jara , they had called her A-Man followed , after a rushed pause , by a dunderheaded Duh . To Gonzalo , his time in prison and the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a punishment for their sins , the pride , overconfidence , and detachment from reality of the Popular Unity party , a fall that would lead to a better future . His attitude she found a bit far-fetched . She dreamed of changing her father 's citizenship , posthumously and against his probable will , and for his murder extraditing the General . <p> Because her murdered father had been erased from national memory , her mother had instead become the martyr , in exile in her own country , the grieving widow who had never remarried , though it was not sure that she had intended to marry her father in I973 or even , Amanda speculated , to have a baby . Now Amanda was to be the stand-in martyr because young women could not have been born , it was generally accepted , without having had fathers . She was to be proof of her father 's existence , though sometimes she did not believe in it herself . The only photo of her father in their Philadelphia row house was a formal shot with her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the night table beside her bed . No wonder boyfriends had been few and far between . Otherwise none of the framed photos in the house were of her dead father , but they were all by him , his lens , his eye , mostly black-and-white photos of poor but extremely cute children on stark ranches and in collapsing shanty towns , of firemen by their gray engines , of fishermen spreading their nets baited with silvery sardines and weighted with empty soda bottles , and of her mother by a beach , including one photo taken of her from the bare shoulders up when she was younger than Amanda , and in which she appeared to have been nude . The black and white had seemed wrong to Amanda , and when she was six , she colored-in the glass frames with crayons . Later Amanda had searched every dot of every photo for a reflection of the photographer , but no , not even in one of her mother 's silver fillings . What had he photographed that had gotten him killed : police making an arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lots between military and representatives of foreign governments , torturers before a torture house , corpses dumped from the air ? Not that these were likely to have been hung on a wall of a little girl growing up in Philadelphiathough there was very little she would have put beyond her mother in those days . There were no photos after the time of Amanda 's birth , as though the art of photography had been forgotten and been swallowed up by older arts , by the hand-woven blankets that also softened their walls . <p> Now she was in Santiago de Chile , where the smog drifts toward and returns from the Andes that dwarf the sprawled city , though those mountains are rarely visible , on account of the smog . Her mother had never mentioned the smog , and Gonzalo , quick to defend anyone who was absent , said that , in the early seventies , the smog had not been particularly bad . In Santiago dogs ran fearlessly across the streets with confidence and aplomb , and seemed to be much more able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide of grubby yellow buses , than Amanda , until she looked more closely and saw that the brave dogs were limping across , that most of them had only three legs , sometimes a fourth hanging vestigially . The dogs of Santiago seemed to be wrong : the wrong heads for their bodies , the wrong fur , and the wrong number of legs . It was a Santiago of carabineros , riflemen , with fingers on their Uzis outside the government halls and at accident sites exiting officiously and ominously from their vans painted with the logo of rifles crossed in the form of crossbones or as though two carabineros were about to shoot each other in the head . She had always been very afraid of Philadelphia 's Fraternal Order of Police , oversized officers driving around with their rifles mounted where their gear shifts ought to have been ( though she enjoyed , she knew , as a white , and no one would ever guess from her skin color or her accent that she was a Latina , a certain degree of diplomatic immunity ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this was supposed to be normal , as the television advertised an alliance of " You and the carabineros of Chile . " <p> Sometimes she found it difficult to believe she was remotely Latin , her accent only part of a dead giveaway , but then she arrived and saw other blonde people , especially in blonde Providencia . She wanted to fit in a bit more , to wear what attractive Santiaguinas were wearing . They all seemed to wear clothes much too tight , even those few who lacked perfectly flat abs . Maybe , she reasoned wishfully , their clothes had shrunk . It was the year of major bright orange with a minor in bright yellow and a distributional requirement of bright green , so she bought orange jeans ( after arguing about the size with the saleswoman who thought she did not understand Spanish numbers and so wrote them down and to go with the jeans , lemon and lime tops . In the dressing room mirror , she looked at her citric self . The clothes looked too tight . Every surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts and her almost flat stomach , was displayed . She imagined a photo of herself at that minute , checking herself out , blown-up to mirror size . She looked , she realized , Chilean . <p> Usually it was the Santiago of Senora Rosa 's apartment in the Providencia neighborhood , where Amanda lived and , in her peasant clothes , always felt underdressed among the men in suits and ties , marching past chain restaurants , cellular phones in hand , children in gray or blue school uniforms , and the women in suits or matching uniforms , beige or blue , that many wore in the service sector , usually walking in matching groups of three or four on lunch break , and gazing through boutique windows at much nicer clothes . It was a Santiago peopled with flat-stomached girls as improbably skinny as the country itself . Amanda 's first week she had peered into the windows of travel agencies , eyeing the prices of tickets to New York , which she hoped meant Newark , which was only seventy-five miles from Philadelphia and her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to her mother why she had to be met at 3oth Street Station , and why she could not stand her life in Chile now that the dictatorship was virtually over . Now and then , it was also the dingy Santiago of Pudahuel and Renca , crumbling neighborhoods of crumbling houses that waited for the next earthquake to collapse , where her mothers and wives lived waiting for dead people to come home or until they themselves should collapse . The teenagers she saw as she visited her mothers and wives were more interested in waiting their turn at baby football , which only seemed as though it would never come . Amanda usually took the wrong bus to get to interviews and usually arrived flinchingly late . Not that the mothers ever criticized , and they always seemed to have at the ready water boiled for instant coffee over which they would tell Amanda what had happened to their families . When she talked with Gonzalo about what he liked to do to ease down from human rights work and interviews with torture victims-ride horses , fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those things . What kind of a life had she led ? As a Chilean would she start to do these things ? He promised to show her something new the next time they could take a break , a little outing to the mountains or the sea , whichever she preferred . All she had seen of Chile was parts of Santiago except for a few field trips to scorched houses that had been used to house torture . There was , he promised her , more . <p> Her whole life sometimes seemed to have been training . It started with Spanish because she was told that she was somehow Chilean though she had never seen the country , just an impossibly long and skinny strip on the map between the Andes and the Pacific . Even her mother had only been there for three years before Amanda was born . The middle school had offered a pilot program in Japanese , but that would have been very hard , and her mother would have been terribly hurt . And when she had learned all the forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bent out of shape by strange stresses , then there had been history and political science courses in college about Latin America , about inflation , about the World Bank , about years of rule by terror and curfew and humiliation . In Latin American history class , she had learned that at the time of the conquest of Mexico , the Spanish conquistadors went running through the streets screaming Santiago ! Santiago ! , which was the name of their patron saint during the Reconquest of Spain . That was always easy for her to remember : Santiago ! Santiago ! At law school there had been discussions of Chile 's general amnesty that the military government had generously passed to pardon itself for the murder of four thousand , including the disappearance of fifteen hundred , including her father , but she understood that might theoretically be overturned , and this is what had brought her to Chile . <p> To be a human rights lawyer , it was argued , she needed to do field work abroad , and what foundation could turn down funding for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had been training for all her life ; what grant giver could turn down a woman who wanted to do research where her father was almost a martyr , the cameraman who had seen too much , or as she found out later some people thought , the photographer who must have gotten what was coming to him . And that some people thought he must have gotten what was coming to him made her really mad at her mom . Amanda had been brought up to believe that 99 percent of Chileans had supported the president who had committed suicide during the coup , so as not to be taken prisoner , even those Chileans who had voted against him . And that the CIA and ITT and Unitas and even Pepsi ( for heaven 's sake ! ) along with the richest one percent , including her own grandparents and great-grandparents , whose vindictive blood Amanda 's mother sometimes accused of coursing through the daughter 's veins , had commissioned the coup and the dictatorship . So when the Senora the lodging agency had placed her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and religious people of the junta , and having the Truth and Reconciliation human rights report quoted apologetically , told her , " Four thousand dead ? a small price to pay , " or after the march , " Only eighty-three arrested ? they ought to lock up the whole group of crazies and Communists and Indians , except for foreigners like you my dear , whose cluelessness they would use for their wicked and atheistic ends , " the object of Amanda 's rage alternated between the Senora , who could sometimes be very sweet about making sure she had enough pillows and hot water , while always being extremely right wing , and her mom , who had led her to believe that there were no people at all like Senora Rosa . When Amanda had first moved in , it quickly became obvious to her that she had better not mention to Senora Rosa her father 's nationality , and certainly not that he had been killed by the junta , an accusation that would have stretched the limits of the older woman 's tolerance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's international law was designed to join in on the feeding frenzy of natural resources that had helped fuel the recent economic miracle . Actually , she had planned to move out for some time , but had been working almost nonstop . <p> When the Senora asked her if she was " pure gringo , " Amanda had confusedly answered " No , " misinterpreting the word gringo as an insult , and only later realized the question was whether she was fortunate enough to be able to trace her entire ancestry to England , which naturally with a Chilean father would be a particularly tricky exercise in wishful genealogy . Chile , Senora Rosa bragged , was the England of Latin America , which Amanda speculated to herself meant they ate lots of greasy chips . She tried unsuccessfully to imagine British people in what she imagined to be the Queen 's English claiming to be " Yes , quite the Chileans of Europe , " and incredulous , she remembered two wars fought in her own country so as not to be the England of North America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression that Chile was Machu Picchu , and that the Chileans were all Indians . She asked Senora Rosa , on account of her dark skin and black hair , what she knew of her own ancestry . This turned out to have been a bad question , another thing that Amanda cluelessly said that angered Senora Rosa , who answered that she was " pure Chilean . " <p> Tension was rising so Amanda excused herself and went to visit with her mothers in their office . " What could that possibly mean , ' pure Chilean ' ? " Amanda wondered . " That Senora Rosa was more Chilean than the Chile bird ? " She saw herself in a store window and , because she had not had time to do so before rushing from the apartment , checked herself out . She looked fine enough , she thought , inhaling , and then she realized she was using as a mirror that travel agent 's window with a list of foreign cities and their prices spread across the reflection of her tank top and pants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family members , and the problem was not with her Spanish on which everyone complimented her . <p> " I am a mother , " one elderly woman told her , and stood on her toes to kiss Amanda 's cheek . <p> " I am a wife , " said another , and Amanda bent to allow herself to be kissed on the other cheek . <p> This was very strange to Amanda because she did not understand why they identified themselves that way . Or rather it was stranger still when she understood . They defined themselves by their relation to the person in their family who had been disappeared , but this made it , Amanda feared , as though they too had been disappeared . They were not widows . The government had never turned over the bodies , so many of them dumped into the ocean like air crash victims , others buried somewhere in the desert ; nor admitted the deaths ; nor even that the husbands and children had ever been alive , that the photos the mothers and wives carried and turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives . Wife of . If their children had been killed , these mothers would no longer be mothers . They could not be mothers of children who had been disappeared , they were mothers . Mothers of . That is how the mothers and wives kept their husbands and children alive even though they had been killed many years ago , through the drooping lines of kinship . They kept them alive by pure preposition , these dead spirits suspended in the of . And so Amanda was not a daughter of the mother who had told her with what now seemed some inaccuracy , all about Chile , though it might have changed , and shaped her life around that long and skinny country of the chile bird at the end of the world , she was the daughter of the father she had never met . <p> " So you are a daughter , " said the mother , taking Amanda by the hand as though to congratulate her . " Welcome home . " <p> She could call herself a half-orphan , but , she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers who had lost their children . The mothers and wives carried the pictures like babies in their arms . The people in the pictures were pure face , lifted from any context but the posters . Amanda thought of her father 's photos , which of those people had been disappeared , the miners before a desert moonscape , the fishermen in a bay . Had he photographed the arrest or murder of one of the people whose image was carried by one of these women ? His confiscated pictures that her mother had not been able to take with her from the country , what were they of ? <p> The mother asked her , " How old are you , mija , " and when she told her , the mother looked into her eyes for a long time and then cried and said while crying , " That is the age my son was when he when he was taken away , " continuing almost inaudibly , " from me . " Amanda looked at the poster propped in a dark corner in which the mustachioed dark-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARE THEY ? written on his chest as though he were asking a rhetorical question , and Amanda wondered what he would have looked like in one of her father 's midrange portraits and what would have been the background and wondered whether her father had ever grown a moustache . Seeing the sadness in the mother , Amanda felt as though the son had maybe been her childhood friend , so when the next time a mother asked her how old she was , she braced for the same reaction , tears , which she did get , when this women said , " When you were being born they took him away . " <p> There was inevitably so much crying at their meetings and her interviews , so much pain , and inevitably Amanda would start crying too , thinking of these poor women crying to her , and she had no idea how or whether to remind them that their relatives , like her father , were dead a very long time , and that even if they could do something to overturn this amnesty law pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was a long shot , their loved ones would still be dead and they would not be mothers of anyone or wives of anyone . In Amanda 's sniffily silence of not knowing what to say , the mothers and wives would comfort her . <p> " You 're just an observer , " said a mother , after complimenting Amanda on her new bright clothes , " and we will not let you get in trouble . " <p> " But come with us to observe , " said another mother , taking her by the arm , " as we put up posters for the rally . " <p> " You can observe if there are any carabineros coming , and if they are , tell us . " <p> Amanda said okay , and they went out to the streets , the darker corners near the busy Plaza Italia , all these older , darker , smaller women who looked as though they were on their way to a Bingo parlor , except for the heavy cans of wheat paste making them lean over , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like me to carry something ? " <p> " Well , dear , if it would n't be too much trouble . " <p> While she waited for the police to come and take them all away , Amanda remembered a diagram on her desk of the four-square-meter prisons where four political prisoners were locked up , and she wondered about calling the embassy if she were arrested , remembering that the prisoners had to take turns sleeping on the floor , and from handles digging furrows across her fingers , she held two paint cans full of paste , for the mothers to dip into , while they were awaiting torture , and under her arms rolled posters were crammed , and execution , but if they were very lucky , they would have the privilege of killing themselves , lifting her arm and a can to let a wife have a poster , only if they were very lucky . <p> " Listen , " said one of the younger women , about her mom 's age probably , but not so youthful . " A police siren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a siren , and the women froze as it got louder , one woman wearing a frumpy dress hanging beneath a frumpy coat caught in mid-brush stroke as though posing for an incriminating photo , whereas orange and green Amanda put down the cans and ducked into a doorway , until the siren got quieter . Amanda wondered why she was wearing bright orange pants and a green top when she needed to blend into the night . <p> Over an instant coffee in espresso cups at Gonzalo MacDonald 's office , he said , " What could that possibly mean , just an observer ? Oh , do you wear contact lenses ? " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because if you do , " he said , " do n't wear them to the rally . " <p> The day of the rally , Amanda woke up to blasted news reports of an air force attack . An announcer shouted above dropping bombs . She did n't know if she was dreaming , and she jumped out of bed . What was going on ? Naked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skies that were peaceful and empty and gray . She heard explosions but saw nothing . There was nothing but dirty sky . The news continued , so Amanda moved toward the sound of planes dropping bombs , in the living room where Senora Rosa sat with a cup of coffee and milk listening to the news report , her eyes closed and head tilted back as though savoring a particular favorite instant coffee or passage of a bolero . Amanda noticed it was a record Senora Rosa was listening to , and from the table picked up the album cover on which <p> was written , SEPTEMBER 11 , I973 , THE HAPPIEST DAY . <p> " When the planes came in , " Senora Rosa said , smiling beatifically , " I climbed to the roof and waved my handkerchief and cheered . When they dropped their bombs , I danced the cueca . I was much younger then . It was so beautiful . " <p> The main boulevard was absent of cars and buses , and the sidewalks were lined with metal blockades supported by a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coup had been declared a holiday , a " day of reflection , " and the only movement was the march gathering , then moving through the rare weekday stillness . Most of the sounds were occasional chants dusted off from more confrontational times and the grim martial rhythms of the Young Pioneer drummers , kids nine to twelve , Amanda figured , playing martial music , not particularly well . They were the serious-faced children whose portraits hung in her mother 's house , though of course , those children would no longer be children , but perhaps fathers and mothers of these children . If these children had grown up in the same country as she had , Amanda thought , they might have been drum majors and drum majorettes or in a marching band that played at halftime of American football games , on the Fourth of July , but , had they been born a generation earlier in Chile , would likely have looked forward to imprisonment or worse . Her trouble relating to them was that , in school , she had neither played in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had she done ? What had she been waiting for ? There were also Communists and Socialists and students with banners with pictures of the president who had committed suicide while the air force bombed his offices . There was even a banner of Victor Jara who had first dibs on her name . <p> " Oh-Amanda , " said a wife . " I 've been meaning to tell you , there 's a beautiful song about a girl with that name . The singer , " she said pointing while Amanda nodded and flinched , " he was brought to the university stadium , and then they cut off his hands so he could not play his guitar , and then they killed him . " <p> As the wife hummed the song , Amanda dug her fingernails into her palms so she could feel her hands and said , " I know . " <p> There were several thousand people , but she wondered , where was everybody else ? She marched with her mothers and wives . Many sympathizers , a wife told her , had probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican clothes she had until more recently worn more often , clothes that the mothers had been glad to have seen replaced by orange and green and yellow , though the mothers were in mourning . They were disappointed to see her wearing glasses that made her look older and more stern . She wore instead of pumps , alas , tennis shoes . Some people her own age and younger , in hippyish clothes and a few modeling mohawks , waved an anarchist flag , milled disorganizedly , and drank cans of beer . Others wearing backpacks-from which she inferred they were students-walked from statue to statue , took aerosol cans from their backpacks and on the bases of the statues spray painted VIVA ALLENDE . Amanda 's wives and mothers carried black-and-white photos of loved ones blown up to postersize and each with the caption WHERE ARE THEY ? <p> The march expanded on wide boulevards and , on side streets squeezed claustrophobically . " Where could we run from here ? " Amanda wondered , dodging a badly parked car , " if the police move in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , marchers banged on the metal walls . Mothers and wives jumped . So did Amanda . The sound was like bullets . The sound was like a firing squad . A wife warned her that some had come in hope of violence . On every building , a student would spray paint a militant message , and friends laughed at each other 's misspellings . People sang militant songs , and chanted , even the wives and mothers , raising delicate fists . Helicopters circled . In perpendicular streets were stationed contingents of armored police , a little more than a stone 's throw away . At first they were passed begrudgingly , then with birds flipped and cries of " pacos " and " murderers , " and as the cemetery approached , passing where mounted carabineros were stationed halfway up hills , stones were thrown , though Amanda could not make out from where , too busy running alongside her wives and mothers , whom she could have easily left behind had she wanted to . <p> The police galloped in to disperse the march , chasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited in cars , buses , and motorcycles . In their shoes and dresses , the mothers ran with small steps into the cemetery and to the monument for the disappeared and executed , Amanda right beside them , and just got in before the police closed off the area with a line of horses and tanks chasing more demonstrators away . <p> Inside the cemetery , as other winded marchers made their way toward where she was , Amanda looked at the huge white slab that listed in engraved black the names of the disappeared on the left side and those executed for political reasons on the right . She found her father 's name instantly and glanced back and forth among his name and that of Victor Jara , in the firing squad list , and Salvador Allende Gossens , which was carved much bigger in the middle . She squeezed her left hand with her right , then her right with the left . <p> There was a sudden calm as a tape of the dead president was played , and then hurried political speeches were delivered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come , stepped up to a microphone stand . He talked of overturning the amnesty law , and this made Amanda smile , thinking of justice in the form of punishment . The Communist leader called the general a murderer and though by any definition save his own , this was in fact true , Amanda knew that according to the constitution the general had imposed , it was still illegal to mention this . <p> A man approached and asked her the plan . She did n't know what he was talking about . <p> Tear gas flew into the cemetery , and rocks were returned over a wall . Some students had had the foresight to stash stones and Molotov cocktails inside the cemetery , and now retrieved them . Outside , Amanda saw through the main gate , other students were clashing with police , throwing stones at the armored vehicles , and when the police came out , at them . <p> An organizer announced that , " Nobody panic , companeros and companeras , everyone just " but at about that time the power was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , banged silently on her microphone , then headed in a dignified trot for another gate . <p> Gonzalo nonchalantly approached Amanda , and as people fled running around the two , suggested jovially , after kissing her cheek and taking her hand , that on the contrary this might in fact be an appropriate time to panic . Instead , he gave her a leg up , she gripped the trunk of a skinny tree , and they scaled the cemetery wall where they could see what was going on inside and outside . Inside most people were fleeing from clouds of tear gas to other exits . Outside , students in T-shirts that advertised sneakers and rock groups , their faces masked in bandanas , were chased by police in gas masks , helmets , and shields , waving batons . A tank blasted water from a nozzle on its roof , first at a pile of burning trash , then at retreating students . The students hid behind the wall , emerging to throw more rocks . <p> An acrid cloud of tear gas blew toward Amanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Very practical . " <p> " Thanks , " she said , as they covered their faces . " This is terrible . " <p> " Naw , this is n't so bad . As the police chief said , it 's unleaded gas . " <p> " Oh great . Tear gas lite . " <p> A busload of police exited an armored bus , and lined up behind shields by the cemetery gates . The two sides faced off as in a scrimmage , the students forcing back the police with stones , until reinforcements arrived with tanks and tear gas launchers . The wind blew the tear gas back at the police . Armored vehicles shuttled back and forth . Amanda heard a cry that sounded like a cry of help but could make out nothing but smoke . <p> " What 's that ? " she said , and they looked toward the human sound until , walking through a hail of stones and a cloud of tear gas , appeared a man in a smock with a box suspended from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream . " <p> " Look at that , " she said . Gonzalo ordered an empanada . Amanda looked at him perplexedly . A tear gas canister buzzed between their faces . <p> " They have been known to use , " he mentioned , covering his full mouth and chewing as though he were still talking but gagged , " live ammunition . " <p> " Why did they ask me the plan ? " <p> " Your Latin American clothes . You look like a professional revolutionary . " <p> Again chased by rocks , the riot squad retreated . A black and white police van sped up the street and braked where the police were hunkered . A plain-clothed man riding shot gun jumped out and , hunched-over , scooted to the hatch-back door . He took out several white garbage bags , from which he distributed to the men of special forces smaller bags with sandwiches and cans of Pepsi . <p> " What is this , " Amanda said pointing , " a riot or a picnic ? " <p> " Ca n't you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink of the carabineros of Chile . " ' <p> Amanda could see it all too easily and added , " ' You and the carabineros of Chile ' and Pepsi . " <p> " You ready to go ? " <p> " Soon , " she said . She wanted to be able to tell the wives and mothers what happened after they had left . She was now the only one with blonde hair , she noticed , left in the cemetery . <p> The students broke into a gardener 's shed and , like enraged villagers chasing a monster , came out sporting rakes . They threw stones and bottles that they had been saving in their back packs . Male students , Amanda noted , noting also that she was the only woman left in the cemetery . The police fired back from their seemingly inexhaustible supply of tear gas . Then the police fled , masked students taking the street , riding on the caretaker 's cart . <p> For a moment there were no police targets for the rocks in their hands , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stragglers from the back of the march , and at sympathizers who had gathered outside . One rock ricocheted off a street sign , then bounced off the wall below Amanda . <p> Several buses of police emptied and the bang of tear gas canisters became frequent , as they rode their armored vehicles into the cemetery . <p> " I think I 'm ready to go , " Amanda said , holding her glasses to her face as she jumped from the wall . They ran through the streets of the cemetery passing rows of crumbling catacombs and people trying to bury their dead , the carabineros in pursuit . <p> Gonzalo pulled the gate of a mausoleum : " This one 's locked too . " " Over here , " Amanda said , already inside another mausoleum , and she pressed back against the wall of one with no reliquaries or plants or flowers , just with Arabic writing engraved in stone . They pressed tight , out of view , and when Gonzalo crossed himself , he was crossing them both . <p> " How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 've been here before . " <p> He shushed himself and her too . Peeping from the edges of the gate , they could see tanks crawling up the cemetery roads , breaking up funerals , mourners and a priest taking off and abandoning a casket , and they could see carabineros clubbing students and dragging them down the road past the mausoleum in which they cowered . They held each other in the corner , out of sight , until much later , when the tear gas dispersed , the screams , gallops , and motors stopped , and the sirens pulled away . <p> She was almost too exhausted to resist his rationale but pointed out , " Celebrate what , that we were tear gassed ? That the newspapers carried pictures of our sympathizers throwing stones and of the general taking Mass from the cardinal ? We 'd have to invite Senora Rosa with us to the beach . " But she probably needed a trip , she knew , to a place that had not been used as a torture center . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the houses wore shaggy wigs of straw . The day was charcoal , the sky almost black and white , and she seemed to remember these kinds of rocks from the background of black-and-white photos of her mother and of fisherman , though presumably much of the shore looked the same . Gonzalo wanted to go fishing , which she had never done . What had she done ? Maybe now that she was in Chile she would begin to do something . The churning green spumy sea in her nostrils was very different from the Atlantic , and it was so rugged and so beautiful and so much like the photos at home in Philadelphia that she would have liked to be in the middle of it the way she had often as a child fantasized swimming in the photos . She wore her bathing suit under her orange pants , because she had not understood that Chile was not the Jersey shore , and you could not swim in September . The green waves were tall as yellow buses bearing down on her before they turned off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and splashed her face . The Pacific was cold cold cold . She was glad that the bathing suit was an extra layer . It was that cold . <p> " Are you going in ? " he said . <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " You look like you 're ready to go in . " <p> " This is really cold . " <p> They marched on the sand , and she collected purple shells till her pockets bulged . She stood by the rocks and watched the waves gather . To look at the vast beauty around her , taking in the bay , the coast beyond , the sky reflecting the ocean , and the islands scattered between , overwhelmed her , would cause her vertigo and cold pain . Instead she concentrated her gaze on one black rock covered with algae , and every few seconds , covered also with foam . A wave came , and it was too late . With a shock , her sneakers and pants were wet up her calves . The cold hurt but seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even told her that it was too cold to swim , just that there was interminable coastline and towering green waves translucing the sunlight , which was true . She walked on squishy sneakers . A man with long gray hair and a long gray beard in a wet suit with a surfboard marched between her and the water . Across his buttocks was written the name of the surfboard . <p> Gonzalo asked , " Do you go surfing ? " She shook her head . " Never surfed , never fished , never rode a horse . What is it you have done ? " he joked , and she was hard pressed to think what she had done . <p> Along the beach there were houses with huge windows and porches . These were the kinds of beaches that were once private and now were the settings of glamorous soap operas . They climbed up the rocks where the beach took a turn , Gonzalo offering help she refused , and she saw her first barbed wire . Apparently some stretches of beach were still private . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be careful . " <p> " You could n't know whose house this is , could you ? " <p> She looked for a sign . It was a sprawling ranch house . There were dry fountains , extensive bushes and succulents , and an empty swimming pool , right on the beach . Why had her mother never mentioned that you could not swim on the beach ? Behind the barbed wire was a huge rusty anchor . <p> " Pablo Neruda 's ? " she guessed . <p> " The opposite , " he said , " politically speaking . Your grandfather 's . " <p> " That 's not funny . " <p> " But it 's true . I mean , if he is your grandfather , then this is his house . One of his houses . " <p> " Then that 's not funny either . Bringing me here and not telling me . " <p> " I just told you . " <p> She looked at the house , then at him , and when she thought he would see her getting upset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couched interior . She said to herself , to Gonzalo , and to the house itself , broad and mop topped , " I 'm going in . " <p> " That 's not funny either , Amanda . You just ca n't go marching in . " <p> " You brought me here to look at it from behind barbed wire ? " she asked , tugging on the safe part of the wire . <p> " I forgot about it until I saw the barbed wire . This is a small country , and he has lots of houses . You 're bound to pass one . " <p> " I 'm going in . " <p> " It 's just a nice beach , and you can go out fishing here . " <p> " I 'm going in . " <p> " Well there was one surprise , but I forgot about this one . " <p> " I 'm going in . " <p> " I should n't have said anything . " <p> " I said I 'm going in . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place like this . " <p> " Oh yeah ? I 'm going in . " <p> " You ca n't go into a place like this without , " he said , " without an invitation , without white gloves . " <p> She looked at him and asked , " How do you get past the barbed wire ? " He took her back over the rocks and around to the front gate . She rang the bell and said threateningly into the intercom , " I am a granddaughter . " There was no response . <p> " Come on , let 's get out of here . This place gives me the heebiejeebies , " he said , though he could tell she was n't listening by the way she stared at the speaker . " I 'll buy you a fish dinner . Hurry , before the Norwegians take it all . " <p> " I 'm going in , " she said . She rang again and announced , " I am the granddaughter . " <p> Then with the sound of an electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeped a maid in a maid 's uniform . <p> " Nobody 's home , " she said , and Amanda , harnassing her selfcontrol , did not say , you are home . Amanda explained who she was . <p> " Oh a natural child . " <p> " Let 's go , " said Gonzalo , and she pushed him back . <p> " Can I come in ? " she said shakily , and the maid opened the door wide enough for her to pass through alone . A German shepherd ran up the private road , bearing down on Amanda , until the maid shouted , " Leave her , Moron , " and Moron stopped and turned back . <p> " It 's a bit of a walk , " Gonzalo said while the door closed on him . " I could go try to reserve a fishing boat for later . And come back and get you . " <p> A long dirt road ended with German cars and the garden and house she had seen from the other side . And there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though the jagged islands were pieces of a jig-saw puzzle placed in their proper places-as in the background of the photo of Amanda 's mother at Amanda 's age , in their living room . Her mother must have been standing a few yards toward the sea viewed exactly from where she was a quarter century earlier . She looked down at her feet and , as though walking in place , wiped them a good long time before entering . <p> Indeed nobody else was home , but the maid took her in through the kitchen door , and offered her an instant coffee . All the doors she saw had tiny waist-high holes in the wood and on the inside rusty iron bars . <p> " Did he spend much time here ? " <p> " Yes , they do not talk about him , but they say he spent much time here . " <p> " And my mother ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " That 's okay . I could always ask her . " <p> The maid took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master bedroom over the yellow clothed bed in an old dark church picture presided Jesus on a cross wearing a midlength skirt ; on the floor a bag of golf clubs ; and on the night table , a picture of an old man in a suit shaking hands with an old man in a uniform , the latter of whom was the former dictator and the former-when the maid said , " You have his chin " - she realized was her grandfather . Amanda looked for a mirror and , finding none , stroked her chin to feel its contours , and then rubbed it harder as though to grind it down into another shape . Behind the photo was a vase of bright orange plastic flowers . <p> In the dining area was a great oak table with what seemed to be , at its head , a throne . Pushed around its lengths were stripped church pews in which her father must have sat , and perhaps her mother too , she would ask her , and Amanda might have as well , had their lives worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a view of the sea that seemed to be trapped in the huge bay window and held at bay by the flimsy filaments of barbed wire . Or rather , there seemed to be a violence of the foaming sea from which this plush refuge of sofas and brick fireplace was protected as by bulletproof glass . She had never seen so much ocean confined to one window . She looked away . From the walls hung harlequins that the maid said the senor , her grandfather , had painted , which were imitation Picassos but did not seem to pose much competition . On the floors old Persian rugs were thrown atop older blanched carpets , only the outline of their patterns remaining . Amanda gravitated , to dry her soggy sneakers , to the fireplace , in which burned the bark around a tree stump and old lumber split with old nails . On a coffee table lay art books and a pictorial history of the carabineros of Chile . She flipped through pictures of police , their horses and dogs , but none of anyone being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in this very house must have been some photos , stashed away , of her father as a child . She walked toward the picture window , where the dangerous sea was blocked off , harmless as a picture . From atop its wide frame , hung down straw as moustache over a mouth , she thought , no , like eyelashes . <p> Cold bedroom followed cold bedroom in a row . Each room had four doors , one per wall : one to a private bath , one with a hole to the landscaped terrace instead of a window , and two to other bedrooms that flanked it . All the bedrooms were neat and looked unslept in , walls covered with church paintings , paintings of the sea , and mounted fish . <p> Amanda said , " I guess he used to fish a lot . " <p> " They say once he went with his father and got sick in the boat , and pleaded to go back , and his father made him stay at sea for his own good , to cure him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed in bed for a week . This Socialism , " said the maid , crossing herself . " That was his revenge against his father . " <p> Well , now Amanda knew something else about her father , something that her mother had never mentioned and maybe did not even know . Not the dubious origins of his politics , which Amanda had always traced with no particular proof to the democratic eye of his camera , but that , though a photographer of fishermen , he was no fisherman himself . <p> The bleating of a telephone called the maid away from a room without a window , and when she closed the door , Amanda was left in the pitch black . The small room was , she remembered , the size of , say , four single beds with one single bed in a corner . She felt for a light switch , stubbed her middle finger on a wall , and came up with nothing . She hoped she would break something , but it would have to be by accident . Cautiously she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt , just for a moment , trapped . The room was darkness except for a peephole , an inch circle that was a concentration of white light in the door leading outside . Amanda felt around on another wall for the door to the next bedroom or a light switch or whatever she could recognize , and slowly her eyes became accustomed to the dark with the circle of light from the door . She looked for a switch plate , and on the opposite wall , she saw some sort of undulating light . There were wavy lines on the wall . She went to touch them and the lines disappeared . She stepped back and the waves returned . By moving her own body , she could control them . She moved back and forth and watched . The wave patterns , she realized , came from the hole in the wall . They were in fact waves . She banged into the bed and sat down on it , pressed against one wall , and watched the waves on the adjacent one . The whole back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miniature waves at once soothing and , because their presence was such a surprise , breathtaking . There was a barking noise , and the maid called out , " Come back here , Moron , this minute . " The shadow of a pointed-eared dog ran upside down across the bottom of the wall . " Moron , " shouted the maid . Then followed a person running along the wall , the maid , in the same direction , also upside down . Amanda did not quite understand what she was seeing there , as there in the southern hemisphere everything outside had been turned upside down and projected on a wall inside . Then the back wall was all ocean again , and she watched it flicker , comfortable in the bed , rattling the shells in her pocket , until the maid opened the door and the room was washed with light that erased everything outside . <p> " This was his room ? " Amanda asked , hardly needing the answer . She let some shells fall from her pocket . <p> Against the outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide to the dirt road . Sometimes she had fantasized that her father had lived . Say he had stayed out of trouble ; or been loyal to his class ; or her grandfather had used his influence in time to have him spared after a few years in prison ; or maybe the army had not attacked but let the scheduled plebiscite go on : and then life would have gone on . The photos she knew would have been hung on walls in Chile . She saw other photos : young Amanda with younger Chilean brothers and sisters in fish-eye around the huge oak table crowded in the pews ; the planes caught in loop-de-loops as they returned to base to arrest the general . On other walls : Photos of Amanda together with her mother , who would have been more laid back , almost catching up with her mother in size over the years . Photos of Amanda beside photos she knew of her.mother , catching up in age and surpassing the earliest photos : Amanda at the shore , Amanda in the mountains on skis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and magnified in the water , her feet , the calves of her cuffed pants , her ankles bent at tortuous refracted angles , and she could have run in to the house , where the maid would have handed her a fresh towel smelling of sea and soap . She would have grown up a blonde Chilean of privilege , gone to private schools with English names , and maybe have known little or nothing about what had gone on in the country during her childhood , the truth of which was a big secret kept only from Chileans , which she would have been , and maybe have known her own country only from brief visits to stay with her grandparents on the Jersey shore , which would have seemed saltier than her own ocean and more pacific despite the apparently reversed names . She would have pronounced words with a pronounced Spanish accent . Then probably she would have studied at a prestigious U.S. college , perhaps the same one in which she actually had studied . The maid would have welcomed her through the front door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had another name , though she could at that moment only think of her mother 's , which was Jane , and if she had another name and another country she might be somebody else anyway , the same person but with a different accent . And she could have brought in her friend , whom she thought she heard approaching , and the maid would have made them a fine lunch and dessert . But would human rights advocates have been in her social circle ? Certainly no Communists would be welcome in her grandfather 's house . Who would have been there ? She would probably by now be married , and would already have Chilean children of her own . There would be a photo of her with her children outside their own house . Maybe she would already be divorced-well they did n't have divorces , just annulments , but they had lots of annulments , all one 's friends and family would swear on the Bible that the ex-couple had never been married , which of course in this case was true . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had gotten on with their lives , when her own mother had already had her , and her father , well her father had already been killed most likely after torture by people supported by people like his father , her grandfather , outside of whose gates she sat slumped , aware all those possible lives had been killed when they had killed her father and killed her country and aware that this was not a productive line of thinking , but resolved to get up and get on with her life here in Chile . <p> Gonzalo leaned above her . He offered to buy her a drink at a marvelous restaurant . She admitted she needed one and gave him her hand to help her up . <p> " It was a huge movie camera of a room . " <p> " How 's that ? " <p> " The light comes in through a hole and on the wall , it projects the outside upside down . " <p> " A camera obscura ? " he said . " You 're kidding . I never saw one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " And he could n't go fishing , so he must have spent his time there watching the light . That explains why he became a photographer . " <p> " Well , if anything could explain it , that 'd do it . " <p> She thought of her father watching the sea and the world pass by past the hole in his door , a world turned upside down , dreaming of turning everything upside down . <p> They climbed a hill where they passed a flock of llamas in expensive sweaters . Condors circled the landing zone as though biding their time . The restaurant was outdoors on a bluff over a bay that she knew with many fewer houses sprinkled on its back from a photo of fishermen untangling a net in her mother 's living room . All the tables and all the chairs were carved out of trees and shellacked so that they still looked like trees , only shinier and in the shape of chairs . A pisco sour , frothy as the spumy sea , calmed her , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those she had picked on the beach . She excused herself presumably to go to the bathroom , but actually went to pay for the meal . <p> " But I pay for the boat , " Gonzalo said with a macho reflex , as they boarded . <p> The fisherman , hired for an hour , rowed out to where he could start the motor . He showed her how to attach bait and hook , and they motored out , accompanied by two dolphins , who skimmed along the surface on either side of the boat . She had never seen dolphins up close . <p> " That was supposed to be your surprise . " <p> " My surprise ? " <p> " There are no dolphins in Chile , except for these two . " <p> " Why are there no dolphins ? " <p> " There just are n't except these two . They got caught in the bay and they must like it here because they never leave . " <p> Amanda squinted at Gonzalo to figure if this were some sort of a veiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it there , jumping out of the water and wrestling each other without arms , swimming under the boat , and nudging it on their way up for air . <p> Tickled , Gonzalo and the fisherman laughed . <p> " Whoa there , " Amanda said . " Take it easy you guys . " <p> She was more tired than she had realized , and wanted to start home , and perhaps get to sleep before having to talk to Senora Rosa , who would certainly take a special interest in Amanda if she knew who her grandfather was . <p> The fisherman said , " Over by the rock are more fish . " <p> The water was also choppier over by the rock , and the dolphins let them be . Waves from two directions combined . The entire ocean seemed aimed at her nose , rushing in in waves , so powerful a smell she could taste the seaweed in her mouth . Amanda was aware that she was not feeling well , a stressful day , and took the rod between her knees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would see , one second , the sky , and the water , the next . She let the fishing line spiked with clams fall and just hoped she would not catch anything . Nor did Gonzalo get anything . Amanda got nothing but sea sick . <p> " Is n't this fun , " the fisherman said , relaxing , and she said , " Oooooh , " and he said , " I see , do you want to turn back , " and Gonzalo said , " It 's okay , we can turn back , " and she said , " No it 's okay , " she would survive , but she was watching her watch as her wrist bounced around the boat . <p> She was feeling sickly but another twenty minutes would be no problem , and Gonzalo had caught no fish yet , and this was what he had come for . Then she felt a tug on her line , and she waited for it to go away , but it would not . She reeled unenthusiastically and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fisherman , a bit incredulous , came over to look but actually , coming out of the water , were two foot-long red fish with geromi-like mouths that had been their undoing . <p> " Great , " said the fisherman , " congratulations . " <p> He took in the line for her , at which point Amanda was sure she was going to spew . She leaned overboard , and then she spewed . Up and out came the lunch . Her body , from waist to head , spasmed . She kept her head overboard so as not to get the boat dirty , and she spewed again , a chunky brown froth that floated on the sea , and she spewed again . She waited a spell . Then it was over . <p> " Do you feel better now ? " said the fisherman . <p> She nodded to be agreeable . Actually she did feel better , and then she turned quickly to spew again . The whole ocean rushing through her salty ears and dirty nostrils seemed conspiring to flip her upside down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same bay . Proof of heredity , she thought . I am the daughter of a man who could not go in a boat in this water without getting sick . A man who was murdered . She wanted to tell this to Gonzalo but was at that moment too ill to speak . It was too much to think . A daughter . She knew the sea sickness and the need for revenge . She closed her eyes and splashed her face with the cold salty cold water . Queasy , she could feel a little center of health somewhere in the sea of her nausea . She was already building a case of words in place of her father 's confiscated pictures and pictures he had not lived to take . A photo of kids playing baby football ; the police taking their parents ; a mother bringing instant coffee on a tray ; their grown-up children having their hands removed from their corpses ; Senora Rosa dancing the cueca ; Gonzalo caught in mid-chew , half an empanada in his hand , as a grenade flew between their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ; a dual portrait of her grandfather and the dictator , but in the foreground , like a child coloring in , she would paint in a row of prison bars . She would go home and rest and then rested she would get back to work , and she would cry chile , chile , chile . <p> Author Affiliation
