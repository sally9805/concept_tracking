But a simple change in your workout-such as intervals-can send those stubborn pounds packing . <p> That 's what happened when Constance Costas traded in her aerobic classes for a treadmill and a weight program .

Plateau-Busting Workout TABLE <p> * ( RPE ) Rate of Perceived Exertion Rate Your Workout to Burn More Calories <p> The higher the intensity of your walk , the more calories you 'll burn . But how do you know what intensity you 're at ? An easy , low-tech method to use is the Borg Scale for Rate of Perceived Exertion ( RPE ) - no arithmetic or heart rate monitors needed .

" My husband and I go up and down a steep hill for 2 to 3 miles almost every day , " she says .

Use your normal walking form , but as you press off the toes of your back leg , squeeze your buttocks firmly , says Gorrell . " Be careful not to tense the lower back . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Firm your body while you walk . <p> Backward walking strengthens the back and abs because your balance is different .

For safety , limit backward walking to a level track or path . <p> Begin by doing each technique for 2 minutes , eventually working up to 5 minutes .
