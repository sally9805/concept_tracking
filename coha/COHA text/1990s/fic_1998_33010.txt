War clouds were gathering over Europe as T. came out of the lower school dormitory of St. Albans and hailed a taxi . Since St. Albans was anEpiscopal school , cabs -- not Mary -- got hailed along that part of Wisconsin Avenue . " Take me to the Smithsonian Institution . " T. enjoyed the driver 's confusion : on Good Friday , 1939 , the Smithsonian would be shut in the morning . T. was a decisive , tall lad of thirteen , not one to be brooked , as his history teacher , a Canadian , liked to say . " There are many entrances to the Smithsonian , " T. said , tossing a lock of blond hair out of grass-green hunter 's eyes . " Drive on , " he commanded , holding his overnight bag on his knees like the potential skull breaker it was . He wore the school blazer with its coat of arms over the breast pocket while , in an inside pocket , he carried a brand-new checkbook from the Briggs National Bank . Due to a bookkeeping error of the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , T. could now , until discovered , draw on $100,000 with a simple squiggle of his pen . Pennsylvania Avenue was nearly empty at this hour . Presumably , the frightened citizenry were all at home listening to their president on the radio as he spoke from his fireside to them at their firesides . Rifest rumors as of that Friday : Hitler was already encamped on Staten Island , threatening the Trylon and Perisphere of the World 's Fair , while Mussolini had been spotted in the Englewood , New Jersey , area , where every day is Columbus Day . Farther afield , the Japanese emperor had been sighted , riding his white horse through San Francisco 's Chinatown , enigmatic lips set in secret smile . Yes . There would soon be war , a war to end all speculations about the possibility of war if these wild mass hallucinations should prove to be , as the New York Times pundit Arthur Krock hinted , premonitions . The taxi driver turned off Pennsylvania Avenue at the old post office , a dark rosy Romanesque tower that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James A. Farley was made postmaster general and refused , so it was rumored in the city of rumors , to allow a single letter that entered the building to go unread either by him or by his closest confidante , Mrs. Farley . " All my wife 's love letters are in that building . " The driver unwisely invited confidences of a sort that T. never dealt in . They were now at the main building of the Smithsonian : the Castle -- with its dark dried-blood red brick crenellated towers and wide moat in which swam not swans -- this was Washington after all -- but chilly soldiers on leave from nearby Fort Myer . Since the drawbridge was down , the cab was able to penetrate the first of no one knew how many courtyards . " He who comprehends the Smithsonian Castle comprehends the universe " was an old Washington proverb , attributed , depending on your informant , either to Anonymous or to Joseph Alsop , the war correspondent with the portable typewriter and weight problem . The first courtyard was empty . A sign reading CLOSED hung beside the massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver , pleased to be the bearer of bad news . " Shut up , " said T. , as he got out of the taxi . " I 'll write you a check on Briggs Bank for the fare . " The feral face cracked wide with unpleasant laughter . " Cash or else , buddy boy . " But by the time the driver had got to the word " boy , " long drawn out to show contempt , T. had slipped through the great doors , conveniently ajar , as Papa Chasseau , the French teacher at St. Albans , had told him they would be ; then before the odious driver could get to him , T. had shut the doors with a crash and slid the iron bolt that locked them . The faint sound of tiny fists beating on elm wood could barely be heard in the huge entrance hall with its high mullioned windows and the banners of the forty-eight states hanging from carved wooden beams . At last T. was at the heart of the American world , or , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , not that T. thought that there could be such a thing as a center . He had always known that New York 's planetarium with its starry skies and unconvincing planets was simply a diversion calculated to confuse anyone who might actually -- like T. -- be in a position to work out what , if not where , the universe was . " Anyway , I 'll find it -- you 'll see -- because if it 's anywhere it 's right here . " T. addressed the only person in the vicinity , a uniformed man seated beneath a " Lost and Found " sign . " My name is T " T. was unexpectedly nervous . " You see , sir , I am an orphan . My parents were killed aboard that zeppelin . Remember the one ? The Hindenburg ? Everybody burned to a crisp in the sky over New Jersey , two years ago . Since then I 've been the ward of Bishop Freeman . He 's the bishop of Washington . The one who works out of the cathedral that 's never going to be finished up on Wisconsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said a woman 's voice behind him . " But your curriculum vitae is wasted upon Lost and Found . ' He is wax . " Wax ? " T. turned to find a tall , stout , handsome lady in the garb of yesteryear , though which of a multitude of yesteryears he could not place . " Wax , " she repeated helpfully . She had a pretty smile , thanks to a number of regular black teeth , and a large bust . T. looked at the man at the desk and saw that he was indeed made , rather crudely on close inspection , of wax . " On holidays we use only wax personnel . " She pointed to a half dozen uniformed guards at the far end of the great hall . " So much less of a bother than flesh and blood and not so heavy as plaster of Paris . " " Well , you 're not wax . " T. knew how to flatter women of any age including the certain age . He had three aunts who lived in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holidays . The lady giggled and flushed pinkly , " Allow me to introduce myself . I am Mrs. Benjamin Harrison . We presidential wives take turns on duty when these boring holidays come around . " " I guess I 've seen you , " said T. , impressed against his better judgment , " in the hall where they keep the inaugural gowns . " " Yes , we 're far and away the most popular exhibit here . " " Only you do n't have heads in there . You 're just a lot of dresses on dummies . " Mrs. Harrison frowned . " True . But after hours , we are ourselves again , out of sight of the public , of course . Also , on holidays or -- private missions , like Mrs ... . " Mrs. Harrison frowned . " Well , speak no evil , as they say . Anyway , you are quite right . They are always trying to save money round here , and on us of all exhibits ! So we 're preparing a petition . Martha -- she 's our chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists on the title . Of course , she was English most of her life . Anyway , Martha has given up on getting us all heads and proper shoulders through channels , and so she has gone straight to Eleanor -- Roosevelt , that is -- as the poor thing is still alive and still first lady and she swears that she -- the live Eleanor of 1939 swears -- she will go to her husband and insist that we have full-time heads . But I 'm not holding my breath . " Mrs. Harrison indicated T. 's bag . " You will be moving in , I see . " " Oh . Yes . " T. was becoming oddly excited by the glamour of waxness versus flesh . " Naturally , you 'll want to penetrate the inner mysteries of the Smithsonian while you 're here . So follow me . " Mrs. Harrison opened a small door beneath a frayed , cannon-torn Confederate flag ; then she led him down a long corridor with a painted ceiling and doors to the left of them and doors to the right , like a hotel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left , with a view of "  - -  Mrs . Harrison threw open the door to a spacious bedroom with a large window overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue --  " the avenue where all of us girls , except Lady Washington of course , there being no avenue then , had our proudest moment , riding to the Capitol to watch our beloved , the first magistrate , be inaugurated . " T. liked the room , which reminded him of the guest room in his aunts ' K Street house . There was the same four-poster and chintz all over everything . He put his suitcase down on the bed . " I suppose I 'll be here for some time . Wo n't I ? " T. was probing . Probed , Mrs. Harrison nodded . " Naturally , you can leave whenever you like . But if you mean to penetrate the mystery of the Smithsonian , which is the mystery of life itself ... " Mrs. Harrison was now redoing her hair in the cloudy mirror of the Empire armoire ; she was also , T. could tell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was saying . " Rest assured that here , somewhere in the bowels of this ancient structure , past all the monsters both living and dead , past blockades and safe places , doublets , penalties ... " " Monsters ? " T. perked up considerably . He liked monsters and whenever he could get time off from his busy classroom schedule , he would play hooky from school and go up to the Capitol and look at the Senate . " Oh , yes . Monsters . Or so they say . We first ladies are sheltered from the worst of the horrors in the basement . In fact , the management insists we keep pretty much to our own quarters except for ... Well , there 's always one rotten apple in every barrel . And wonderful Eleanor -- so intrepid -- going wherever she likes , doing good . But ... " Mrs. Harrison chuckled . " Lady Washington constantly complains that the management never lets her see any of the real monsters , much less mysteries , only the Potemkin ones . " " The what ones ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mrs. Harrison was at the window , looking down on the streetcars as they rattled past , and the pedestrians -- mostly men -- in white straw hats . Spring was at hand . Cherry blossoms . Dogwood . " Come here and I 'll show you how the thermostat works . It 's fun . " T. joined her . " What 's a thermostat ? " At the window she showed him a small enamel box with a dial on it . " The Mechanics ' Room thinks up all these new inventions , like this one which controls the temperature of the room . Only it 's not on the market yet . Then one evening when the Chief Mechanic was working late in his own private laboratory up in the tower , he , somehow , do n't ask me how , attached the thermostat to a clock -- or was it an hourglass ? And then to a carbon-dating calendar , whatever that is , something like the ones the mortuaries used to send you at Halloween in my day , and now -- well , look ! " Mrs. Harrison twirled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " T. looked down and saw the avenue blurring and changing . Streetcars were replaced by horsecars , and everyone 's clothes changed . " It goes back in time ! " T. shivered with excitement . Mrs. Harrison stopped the dial . There was now a bright clear view of the avenue , as a great hearse , drawn by huge black horses , moved to the dirgelike music of a military band . The men standing on the sidewalk uncovered as the be-flagged coffin passed . Women wept . " Lincoln 's funeral , " said T. , with the authority of one who had spent many hours in the Palace Theater on Fourteenth Street . " Is it an old movie ? " " Oh , no . There were n't any movies back then ... " We 've had an awful lot since . In the one with Raymond Massey --  " " This , buster , " said Mrs. Harrison with the quiet majesty of a true first lady , " is the real McCoy . " T. pressed his nose against the glass and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street in the direction of the White House . The lady was right . Whatever it was that he was watching was not a movie . The crowds were endless as far as he could see under a real sky , not Technicolor as in Gone With the Wind , which he had only just seen at the Capitol Theater . T. put his hand on the thermostat . " What happens if I turn this even further back ? " " You 'll be able to look further back in time , as we did just now with Lincoln 's funeral . " " How far ? " " No one knows . It would take somebody centuries , they say , to get back to the beginning of the world , and your hand would probably fall off long before . The Chief Mechanic claims to have seen a dinosaur swimming out there when all this was underwater . " Mrs. Harrison returned the dial to the present day . " What happens if you turn it forward , to the future ? " " The Chief would rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what with war clouds over Europe and you-know-who on Staten Island . " T. made a mental note to see as much of the future as possible . Perhaps this was the Secret of the Smithsonian . The ability to see what will be as well as what was . Mrs. Harrison indicated a placard on the door . " These are the times your meals will be delivered . When you 're finished , leave the tray outside in the hall . Now I must get back to the Assembly . " She gave a radiant if overplump smile . " We seldom get visitors , you know . I mean , overnight ones , like you . The Chief Mechanic thinks you may be important now that storm clouds are , once again ... " Suddenly the entire room -- building ? T. could not tell -- gave a shudder . T. felt mildly sick to his stomach as he rushed to the window where 1939 was doing its usual dull Good Friday thing . " Is the Smithsonian on a seismic fault ? " he asked , turning to Mrs. Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , an African-American native of D.C. , the District of Columbia , appeared with a great smile and a small tray . He wore a Pullman car waiter 's white uniform . " Lunch , " he announced , putting the tray down on the desk in front of the window . With a flourish he removed the battered pewter cover to reveal chicken a la king . " That 's always Friday 's lunch since the local Catholics stopped being so kosher about the fish . And tapioca pudding for dessert as well as the Smithsonian special salad with -- you 'll find it under the napkin -- the recipe for the special dressing which you can make right here in bed ... " " Thanks , " said T. , who was very partial to chicken a la king . The waiter removed a miniature xylophone from his pocket and struck three melodic chords , just the way they do on the trains . Then he , too , was gone . T. wolfed down lunch . The Smithsonian 's mysteries had given him an appetite . Then he put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got his notebook from his suitcase as well as a brochure giving the history of the Smithsonian and a description of its contents . He was particularly eager to see the Hall of Aviation , where old airplanes were kept . The Assembly of First Ladies Exhibit -- nice as Mrs. Harrison had been -- did n't really attract him . They were all so old and probably spent their free time playing bridge like his three aunts in K Street . For a moment he studied the administrative chart of the Institution . Under the heading " More Chiefs than Indians , " numerous department heads were listed . Mrs. Harrison had mentioned the Chief Mechanic , but which one ? Five were listed . Which one had sent for him ? Yesterday , the telephone had rung in the dormitory of the lower school . The Canadian dorm master and history teacher , Mr. Pratt , T. 's sworn enemy , had answered it . Grudgingly , he passed the telephone to T. , who heard a man 's voice say , " The secret of the universe is here at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Papa Chasseau will leave the door open . Tell no one . War clouds are gathering ... " The usual . Then the sign-off . " This is the Chief . " Now here he was , as requested , ready for anything . Well , almost anything . Certainly , he was not ready for the contents of an envelope that someone had pushed under his door . He assumed that it was from Mrs. Harrison since it smelled of her frangipani . There was no salutation and no signature . Only the bleak message . " Shun Mrs. Grover Cleveland as she is a voracious chicken hawk . " That was all . But what did it mean ? Something to do with the delicious chicken a la king he had had for lunch ? In any case , how could an old , not to mention dead , first lady be a hawk of any kind ? Truly the Smithsonian was proving to be full of mysteries . Now it was time for him to meet the chief who had rung him in the dormitory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brochure , T. marked with an X his room on the Pennsylvania Avenue side , noting that at the end of the corridor where his bedroom was , another corridor branched off to the right , ending in a room marked " Chief Director of Historical Evolution and Ceramics Evaluation . " This could be the chief he was looking for . T. walked slowly down the hall , opening doors as he passed , revealing bedrooms that were a duplicate of his own . But , alarmingly , in each of these rooms there was a tall , lanky , golden-haired youth whom he recognized as a duplicate of himself . This was dismaying . Worse . With so many copies , which T. was he ? As usual , when puzzled , he began to mathematize the problem . Should one T. be raised to the nth power ... But mathematics failed him . He had been , somehow , for no apparent reason , copied -- six times , always assuming that the T. in the corridor was himself the original , the prototype . First Mystery of the Smithsonian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen bedrooms containing other T. 's , he turned right . The new corridor was wider , higher , longer than the one that housed the multiple T. 's . Between large stained-glass windows depicting the westward expansion of the original American settlers , he could make out the dome of the Capitol in the distance . Suddenly , a sound of drumming , not unlike Gene Krupa 's recent gig at the Capitol Theater . The sound seemed to be coming from behind a massive mahogany door flanked by two wax guards . T. tried the door handle ; it turned ; he pushed the door open just wide enough for him to poke his head into -- another world ! A sign identified this world as the Early Indian Exhibit room , a favorite exhibit of T. 's childhood . A couple of dozen Indian braves and their squaws and papooses -- papeese ?  - -  were going about their business in and out of wigwams on a sunny day , while a realistic painted backdrop , called a diorama , showed their native environment : trees , a distant plain with buffalo roaming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier visits . The Indians were no longer artfully molded and tastefully painted figures of plaster ; instead , they were now real men and women and children in colorful native garb , while the mock fire -- over which a cauldron of stew had been placed -- was very much a real fire , with eye-stinging black smoke , and the pot had a section of what looked to be a real moose floating in it . The background was no longer painted but real : tall aboriginal trees , endless grassy plains where buffalo ambled in the middle distance and a hawk suddenly soared across the intense blue sky of yesteryear . T. was about to slip out of the exhibit before its occupants became aware of him , but , as he was backing toward the door , suddenly it slammed shut and the sinewy arm of a sweaty young brave encircled his neck . " Got ya ! " said the brave in flawless American-Indian reservation English . T. struggled to get free , but the brave was as strong as an ox . Also , get free for what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now just another wigwam , with a running stream back of it in which naked papeese splashed about . " I 'm a guest of the Chief . " T. gagged out the words as the pressure on his Adam 's apple kept increasing . He could not utter the presumably magic word " Mechanic . " " I take you to Chief Yellow Sky Bird . He big chief here , Puritan white boy . " Then the redskin dragged T. to the largest of the wigwams , where , on a log , the chief sat , knitting himself a warbonnet of eagle feathers . " How , " said T. A greeting he had gleaned from a recent film about the taming of the West . " How yourself . " The chief looked down at T. who now lay on his back , staring at the chief 's moccasins , a supine position that the young brave had arranged for him . " What brings you to our neck of the woods , Puritan white boy ? " Behind the chief , two squaws were beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as white as he , with long chestnut-colored hair , a truly saucy minx of a colleen . " Miscegenation , " blurted T. , his conscious mind inadvertently overthrown by his racially sensitive District of Columbia unconscious . " You 've been reading too much Parkman . Racially , we are pure and intend to remain so until the cows come home . Where you from , boy ? " " Up on Wisconsin Avenue . " T. was evasive . No use involving the school in his caper . The chief sighed and put down his eagle-feather knitting . " At least you 're not using the old I just happened to be visiting the Smithsonian , ' like so many of the strays do . It 's got to be some sort of mass hypnotism or , maybe , hysteria out there . We often debate around the campfire whether or not there is such a thing as the Smithsonian Institution . A place where we exist in a negative -- even entropic -- state , on permanent exhibit , as so many of our visitors like to tell us before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of any of this . But he was also not about to be cowed . " You are -- like it or not -- a permanent exhibit . I know . I 've been looking at you ever since I was a kid . Fact , thousands of people come here to see all of you in your colorful native clothes , doing colorful native things , except , of course , you 're really all just a bunch of painted dummies ... " " We 're what ? " The chiefs scowl betrayed a suspiciously broad knowledge of D.C. slang . T. had by now worked himself to a sitting position on the ground . The fire 's smoke was making his eyes water . " I mean you 're just plaster or plastic , or something , you know , models . " " Does this look like plaster ? " The chief revealed a bare arm with a powerful biceps . " I guess you 've been working out quite a lot , at the gym . " " I have no quarrel , " said the chief , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition that there are numerous simultaneous worlds of us Iroquois . So your Smithsonian concept is a sort of metaphor -- yet another world imposed on ours and invisible to us . Except for the odd stray , like you , from the British or French colonies . " The chief turned to the brave who had captured T. The bronze youth lifted him by his hair from a seated position to a standing one . T. thought he was going to be scalped . " Fanny Farmer time , " said the chief comfortably . The brave removed T. 's jacket , unbuttoned his shirt . " Hey , what are you doing ? " " Preparing you for the Great Spirit 's pleasure . " A second brave was now removing T. 's shoes and socks . " You are n't going to take all my clothes off ? " T. was aware of the morbid interest of the women all around him , particularly the white girl . T. 's question proved to be rhetorical . Trousers were yanked off . Now he stood naked except for his so-called jockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were addicted to . T. wondered if he made enough noise one of the many chiefs of the Institution might hear . But then if they could n't hear the racket that the Indians were making , it was unlikely that they would hear him . Besides , it was Good Friday , a day of special celebration in the District of Columbia , when the Daughters of the American Revolution , clad in tasteful black and shocking beige , made their way , lamenting , from Constitution Hall to the Great Lingam itself , the obelisk monument to Washington , where the current president , in his wheelchair , would receive them in the phallic shade , chewing on his cigarette holder , little dog , Falla , at his side . T. was well and truly trapped by demented Red Indians . just back of the chief , one of the braves was sharpening a knife , with many a flashing smile in T. 's direction . Fortunately for T. 's modesty , the jockey shorts were not removed . Unfortunately for T. 's life , his arms were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound , leaving just enough space between them so that he could shuffle but not run . The chief was now on his feet . He came so close that T could smell the buffalo fat and who knows what else on that massive body . A huge rough hand sandpapered T. 's smooth chest , erecting a nipple in the process . The chief beamed . " Prime veal , " he said , and the braves at the fire all sycophantishly repeated the sinister phrase . T. himself hated veal , and , for a moment , wondered if dinner was about to be served . If so , he would explain , tactfully , that he was a vegetarian and a single new-world potato would suit him just fine . The chief tugged at the solitary tuft of golden hair under T. 's arm , outward and visible sign of a formidable if precocious sexual maturity ; for sheer copiousness , his wet dreams were the talk of the dormitory . " Ow , " said T. , thoughtfully -- he was thoughtful as he pondered just what the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... ? The chief turned to a brave whose face was painted in red , white , and blue stripes . " Brave , bring me preprandial Scotch on the rocks . " " You drink firewater ? " T. was intrigued because , if he did , the white man had already begun his corruption of the noble red man . " Only the best , " said the chief " Joe Kennedy is our bootlegger . We call him Great Hyannis Hyena . " " Gosh . " T. could think of nothing else to say . The present Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's in England was supplying , probably illegally , bonded firewater to the Smithsonian Early Indian Exhibit . In the middle distance T. could see the lovely white girl as she and two comely squaws presided over a huge cauldron atop a blazing fire . As the water bubbled , they threw in ears of corn and Birds Eye frozen lima beans -- a sensation that season which had even found favor in K Street , where the aunts agreed that , for once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . Plainly , the Indians ' cuisine was being kept up-to-date by the Smithsonian even though none of these exhibits seemed to have any idea where they were situated or who was looking after them -- except for the chief 's curious remark about the Great Hyannis Hyena . Otherwise , they appeared to believe that they were living in the primordial wilderness and preparing for a dinner of prime veal . Sweat trickled down T. 's side , tickling him . Tumbler of whisky in hand , the chief said , " Well , here 's looking at you , Veal . " T. felt dizzy ; legs began , inadvertently , to shudder . " You 're not cannibals , are you ? " " Let 's say that like our Aztec cousins down Mexico way , we crave protein of the sort that can only be got by eating flesh . Indian can not live by succotash alone . " In unison , several braves in the vicinity chanted this line , apparently the chorus to a hymn to meat . With his head , T. indicated the herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of prime beef out yonder on the range . " " True , " said the chief , accepting yet another tumbler of Joe Kennedy 's best . " But have you ever tried to spear a buffalo after a hard night at the old wassail bowl ? Then there 's the sheer drudgery of dragging it back to the campfire and the awful mess of skinning it ... " The chief gave T. 's crotch a playful tweak . " Which reminds me , since you 're being boiled , we skin you first . Alive . This means that every one of our squaws is going to find a lovely pair of white kid gloves in her Christmas stocking . Meanwhile , I 'm about to have me a pair of mountain oysters . " T. never knew whether it was the white kid gloves , or the thought of his mountain oysters , but terror seized him and he pissed into his jockey shorts as the braves roared with more than a hint of homoerotic delight . " Take Veal to the skinning wigwam , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them smoked mountain oyster canapes , to whet my appetite for the fresh ones coming up . " A second squeeze of his crotch and T. swooned dead away . When he came to , he was still trussed like a veal and the soaked Jockey shorts were gone . Naked as he was born , he lay in front of the pale-eyed chestnut-haired squaw who held in one hand an early Bronze Age knife with a carbon-14H dating tag on it -- plainly lifted from another exhibit . In her other hand , she was playfully juggling T. 's mountain oysters . " No ! " he bellowed . " These are going to make a tasty dish for our chief . How old are you , Veal ? " " Thirteen , " he stammered . She looked at him , appraisal in her eyes . " On a clear day , " she observed thoughtfully , " you could pass for fourteen . " " How about getting me out of here ? I mean we 're both white . " " Oh , but I 'm a captive squaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A slave to the lust of my brave . He 's the one with the double braids that I got him to work red ribbons into , using bear grease , of course , and practically over his dead body as , he kept saying , me no Nancy boy ' ... " During this the beautiful white squaw was using her razor-sharp anachronistic carbon-14H bronze knife to cut not T. 's smooth white skin , but his bonds . Freed at last , T. sat up ; hands and feet tingled as blood recirculated . The white squaw was now looking out the wigwam to see if the coast was clear . Then : " Wrap yourself in that blanket over by the chest . The one that says Pullman . ' And cover your head . The sight of our golden hair and eyes and skin turns your average brave into a beast . Thank the Lord , " she added contentedly to herself . Quickly , T. shrouded his blond hair and veal-white body in the Pullman blanket . Plainly , **25;308;TOOLONG Indians were supposed to be living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great iron horse -- a train -- could be seen crossing the tawny plains of older times in the distance . " Follow me . " Like some great cat or a small pony , she led him out of the wigwam , which was at the edge of the settlement hard by a stand of cottonwood trees . " We go through the stand , " she whispered , urgently . At the other end of the settlement the braves could be seen , sitting cross-legged around their chief , quaffing cocktails prior to a succulent dish of prime veal from the pot where the squaws , salivating at the thought of what was to come , were now adding okra and kiwis to their aromatic bubbling stew . T. dashed through the woods , barely able to catch up with the fleet-footed white squaw while holding on to his Pullman car blanket at the same time ; the fact that he was barefoot slowed him down considerably as she led him through a cactus rock garden , then across a shallow pebbly stream toward a thickly wooded hill . T. was breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " safety , " her optimistic word , of the forested hill whose view of the wide dusty plains ended in a vista of snowcapped purple mountains , originally painted in as background for visitors to the exhibit but now very much , if not the real thing , rendered in astonishing 3-D . A herd of buffalo munched their way toward them , like so many slow-moving burlap sacks . " I 've saved you , Veal darling . " The white squaw threw her arms around him . Pullman blanket fell to mossy bank . She held his sweaty body to hers , tickling and tweaking and otherwise arousing him -- a waking wet dream in dizzying 3-D , he thought , tugging at her maidenly wraparound of deerskin which , in less than a trice , she wriggled out of . They were the same height . Green eyes gazed into hazel eyes . Warm loins pressed against even warmer loins . Did he fling her , or did she fling him onto the mossy sward ? No matter . There was no sequence of consequence , only confluence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
