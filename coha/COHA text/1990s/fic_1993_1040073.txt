She would argue that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make more money than anybody could possibly use indicates that they behave that way not because they want more money but because they do n't know any better . Also , the incentive argument assumes that what most of them do is economically beneficial to the public  --  an assumption that flies in the face of the past ten years of American history . Let 's take the case of Michael Milken , who made $550 million in 1987 .

A lot of people who were cheated by those felonies might not have been cheated . I rest Alice 's case .  | November 5 , 1990 11 y wife and I went to Istanbul . A friend of ours I 'll call Colette sent us there to check out her daughter 's new boyfriend . That seems odd , I suppose , unless you yourself have daughters of serious-linkage age who live far from home . It did n't seem at all odd to us . I hasten to say that we had already planned a trip to Istanbul before we got our assignment from Colette . I had some business there , although Colette informed me that it would have to take a back seat to the real mission . " You are in Istanbul to check out Juliet 's boyfriend and return with a full report , " she said . " If that leaves time for your other business , fine . " She said it rather like an intelligence officer in a World War II movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zurich that he should carry on with his ordinary activities as well as he can while he tries to find out whether the Nazis are using Switzerland as a secret supply route for uranium . In the movies the businessman usually begins by trying to turn down the intelligence officer who wants to recruit him ( " After I bailed out of that burning B-i7 , colonel , I swore to my wife that I would n't make the mistake of risking my neck once too often , so you 'll have to get yourself another boy " ) . But we accepted our assignment from Colette cheerfully . We 've never bailed out of a  | burning B-i7 , but we 've checked out plenty of boyfriends . On the plane to Istanbul I told my wife that I had been looking forward to seeing Juliet even before we received our assignment and that I was certain that checking out the new boyfriend would present no problem to two checker-outers of our experience . " I did n't hear Colette say what this lad 's doing in Turkey , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Has he gone over there to study at the university ? " " He lives there , " my wife said . " He 's Turkish . " " Turkish ! " I said . " Nobody said anything about his being Turkish . How are we supposed to check out a boyfriend who 's Turkish ? " The boyfriends we 've checked out have been American boyfriends . Our expertise is in American boyfriends . We know the field . We 've established specific , easily applied standards . Take the question of earrings , for instance . We have what amounts to a body of case law on earrings . It goes back to when our own daughters were about the age the shampoo marketers call preteen . Out on a walk one day , I happened to pass a young man who was wearing four earrings in his left ear . When I got home , I said to my daughters , " I think you should know , for the future , that the answer to either one of you bringing home a guy with four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even think about it . " " How about a guy with one earring ? " my older daughter asked . I considered that for a while . No parent wants to appear inflexible . " If he 's enrolled in a fully accredited graduate or professional program , one earring is O.K. , " I said . I wo n't claim that the earring standard has not been adjusted over the years . The point is that there is a standard , and it can be applied easily to American boyfriends .  | I know what I think about how an American boyfriend dresses and how he greets me ( " Hiya , pops " is automatic grounds for not checking out ) and what he 's studying or what he does for a living . But a Turkish boyfriend ! In Turkey , for all I know , four earrings in the left ear indicates membership in a student organization famous for producing eminent brain surgeons and distinguished supreme court justices . " There 's another problem , " my wife said when I told her all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We 're checking him out in Turkish ! " I said . " It 's impossible . We should have turned down the assignment . We should have told Colette that we gave up this sort of thing after we had to bail out of a burning B-i7 . " My wife said we had to keep our promise to Colette . As soon as we could arrange it , we had dinner with Juliet and her boyfriend . I 'll call him Ahmet . He spoke English a lot better than we had been led to expect . My wife and I liked him instantly . It was obvious that he would never have said " Hiya , pops " in any language . When we got hack to the hotel after a lovely evening , I said , " Ahmet checks out . " My wife agreed . " You see , that was n't so hard , " she said . " It is n't necessary to have all those baselines and standards . " " Maybe not , " I said . " Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 , 1990 You may be wondering why I have n't gotten around to discussing the question of whether or not female reporters have a right to be in the locker rooms of the National Football League . As it happens , I 'm still trying to deal with a news report of several weeks ago that a Japanese construction company barred a female reporter from a tunnel-completion ceremony because , in the words of the project supervisor , " the presence of women could anger the jealous Goddess of the Mountain . " After that , I have to get to the issue of whether or not the Saudis should allow women to hold driver 's licenses . In other words , I 'm working up to this . Before we proceed , I 'd better state my position clearly on the general question of equality between the sexes . In previous comments on the public record , I have made it clear that I believe there to be no essential differences between men and women except that women tend to believe new slipcovers are needed in the spring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsion to take out the garbage . That 's where I stand . You 'd think someone with a position that forthright would have no patience at all for the argument by Japanese construction workers at the Sakazukiyama Tunnel that all women be banned from tunneling sites or with the response of the project supervisor , one Hatsuo Sato ,  | who said of the banning of the female reporter , " I see nothing discriminatory in the action . " You would be absolutely right . My first response to the news from Japan was to say , " Nothing discriminatory ! Give me a break , Hatsuo ! How would you feel if you wanted to pop down to your local for a pick-me-up and you were banned because the proprietor said that the presence of a tunnel-construction project supervisor would make the God of Sake feel woozy ? Also , even if there is a Goddess of the Mountain , what makes these construction guys think they know that the presence of women makes her jealous ? Maybe she 's the sort of goddess who likes the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties where they all get together and talk about how ratty the slipcovers are beginning to look . " Unfortunately I uttered my criticism of Hatsuo Sa-to 's position in front of my friend Barton , who explained to me that I was failing to understand this matter in its cultural context . Barton always wants to understand everything in its cultural context . I ca n't tell you what a pain he is . Let me give you an example . Several weeks ago , I returned from a short visit to Istanbul . Speaking within Barton 's earshot of the increasing traffic problem in that otherwise noble metropolis , I said , " I mean this in the most constructive way and I would n't for a moment want to interfere in Turkish internal affairs , but it seems to me that it might help the traffic situation over there if they used lanes . " Barton told me that I was trying to impose an essentially Western notion on a Muslim nation that has one foot in Asia . I do n't know how a country can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barton talks . Also , I do n't know what the religion of a country has to do with traffic  | lanes . It 's not as if it says in the Koran somewhere that cars should all move at the same time toward a narrow opening , like restless cattle moving toward the one hole in the corral fence . Barton is the same way about the question of women not being permitted to drive in Saudi Arabia . What I suggested is that the Saudis could gradually phase in the right of women to drive . First they 'd let women drive but Saudi men would be allowed to tell woman-driver jokes . Then , after a decent interval , the men would have to give up the woman-driver jokes . I think they could do it . I read somewhere that the Saudis managed to give up slavery twenty-eight years ago , so it 's not as if they 're that set in their ways . Barton says that putting it in terms of woman-driver jokes is just another indication that I , as a Westerner , ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly . A Saudi woman wants to go out and comparison-shop slipcover fabrics . Her husband says the slipcovers they 've got are practically brand-new . So she tells him to empty the garbage . While he 's out there , she jumps in the car and is about to go downtown to the fabric store . Then she remembers : she 's not allowed to drive . It does n't have anything to do with the cultural context . It 's against nature .  | November 26 , 1990 The fact that Ronald Reagan 's memoirs came out just about the time that the singers of Milli Vanilli were exposed as not having done the singing on their album can be used to support the historical theory known to scholars as the Inevitable Confluence of Turkeys . The fact that Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan of Milli Vanilli had their Grammy taken away while the ghostwriter and editors who put a number of Ronald Reagan 's tired fantasies into complete sentences continue to think of themselves as respectable practitioners of a noble calling is yet another in a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards than the publishing industry . As Christopher Hitchens pointed out in The Nation , the Reagan turkey contains any number of statements and implications about Reagan 's life and his presidency that have been disproved in the public press over and over again . While Reagan may by now have actually convinced himself , for example , that he was among the returning G.I.s who fought the Second World War , Iitchens wonders about the culpability of editors and ghostwriters who consciously pass off a lot of this old bushwa as historical fact . Actually , he does n't wonder much at all : he calls them " accomplices to a fraud . " The publisher of Reagan 's memoirs , Simon and Schuster , is known as a publishing house with a partic-  | ularly strong devotion to the cash register  --  the unkind in the industry occasionally refer to it as Simon 's Shoe Store  --  but its policies in the practice of ghostwriting are common to the trade . It is not unusual even for people who like to refer to themselves as journalists  --  people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who tried to pass off as American something assembled in Taiwan  --  to sign their names to books they did n't write a word of . Some of these books carry no hint at all that they were ghostwritten  --  not even an acknowledgments paragraph from which a reader who knows the code can divine the name of the actual writer . ( The Reagan book had one of those , although you 'd think all concerned might have craved anonymity . ) Publishers , unlike rock producers , are never exposed in the press for presenting someone as the author of a book he did n't write . In publishing , lip-synching is considered perfectly all right . Several years ago , I had a chat with a man who ran a half-hour book program on radio , interviewing authors who came through his city on promotional tours . He started by asking what I thought about the old gripe among authors that during such tours they are often interviewed by people who have n't read their book . I said that it seems unreasonable to expect , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author every morning to read five books a week in addition to his other duties . Then the radio man turned to what was for him the real problem : authors who have n't read the book . " Authors who have n't read the book ? " I said . " I do n't think I understand . " " Well , more and more books are ghostwritten , " he said . " So if I say to the author I 'm interviewing on the air , You write here at the beginning of chapter nine . . . , ' it may turn out that he does n't know what I 'm talking  | about because he has never read chapter nine . He 's never read the book . " " Once again I 'm made to feel naive , " I said . " I really do n't mind if they did n't write the book , " said the radio man , an amiable sort if I ever heard one . " But if they 're going to be interviewed on a book program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as a matter of professional courtesy . " I would agree . Some years ago , I suggested that the publishing industry might think of complying with basic standards of truth-in-packaging by including with the blurbs it often runs on book jackets ( " Hendricks writes like an angel with steel in its guts " ) the relationship of the person praising the book to the person who ( maybe ) wrote it : " old college roommate , " for instance , or " cousin " or " just a friend returning a favor . " That suggestion , I regret to report , was not taken up by the industry . Here 's a second chance . Each book could just carry a standard statement , similar to the standard disclaimer in novels about the characters being strictly fictional . It would say , " The publishers certify that the author of this book has read it . " This might be a good way for the publishing industry to start its climb toward the ethical standards of Milli Vanilli . Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without having heard the album . In fact , they knew it well enough to lip-synch it .  | January 21 , 1991 For years I 've been complaining that anyone who attempts to comment in a satiric vein on events in this country finds it difficult to concoct a situation so bizarre that it may not actually come to pass while his article is on the presses . It 's what I call being blindsided by the truth . Another example is at hand . In 1986 , Congress passed a law making it illegal for a private citizen to own a machine gun , and the National Rifle Association has fought the law all the way to the Supreme Court . No , I did not make that up . The fact that you think I must have made it up reflects precisely the problem I 'm talking about . Try to look at this from the viewpoint of those of us who attempt to keep the wolf from the door by cobbling together small jokes about the happenings of the day . One of the few tools we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the point is to make fun of the NRA 's maniacal opposition to the slightest attempt at regulating weapons . A columnist with a small amount of imagination  --  and that is the amount most of us have ? might well choose to illustrate that point by envisioning the NRA 's response to a law banning machine guns . He could imagine postcard campaigns to remind Congress that the intention of the framers of the Constitution was to make certain that every single citizen had p 6i a machine gun . He could describe full-page magazine ads in which distinguished citizens testify that , as lifetime members of the NRA , they would hate to see the day when criminals had access to deadly weapons but a decent American guy could n't even go dove hunting with his machine gun . But the poor jokemaker has been robbed of that exaggeration . It 's already true . Is he supposed to up the ante by imagining the response of the NRA to a law that would provide for a cooling-off period before a teenager with a serious juvenile court record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store with a mortar or an antitank gun ? You say that 's too silly ? I would agree with you . On the other hand , maybe it 's already true . You want another example ? No problem . Let 's take the case of Nancy Reagan , who is known as someone so obsessively concerned with her husband 's place in history that Ronald Reagan 's place in history may be as the president whose wife was obsessively concerned with his place in history . Let 's say there is a columnist somewhere who has finally run out of Sununu jokes and has taken a blood oath never to mention Dan Quayle . Needing a subject as deadline approaches , he decides to have a little fun at Mrs. Reagan 's expense . Too late . According to a recent item in Newsweek , poor Ronald Reagan now has to haul himself around the talk-show circuit one more time because Nancy Reagan ca n't stand the fact that his volume of memoirs , An American Life , is being outsold by Millie 's Book , the memoirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan insider " as saying , " The dog book has really gotten under her skin . " Wait ! It 's worse than that . Here 's something that not even someone who earns his living making mean , underhanded remarks about decent public servants could concoct : the dog 's book is better than Reagan 's book . Com-  | pare the reviews . Millie wins . The problem is not simply the old actors ' saw about the inevitability of being upstaged if you do a scene with a kid or a dog . Reagan 's book is so clogged with patently untrue fantasies that some reviewers have suggested as a more appropriate title An American Lie . The dog has had no criticism of that kind . If there is a jokemaker somewhere who was planning to comment wryly on boring White House memoirs by contemplating the possibility that a president is put in the literary shade by another president 's dog , he has missed his chance . I should report , by the way , that the Supreme Court refused to hear the NRA challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving in place a ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that the law is constitutional . So , you 're about to say , the real events that compete with the imaginations of the jokemakers are not quite as bizarre as I make them out to be : we do not , in fact , live in a country that permits private citizens to own machine guns . Wrong . Trying to put a good light on the decision , an NRA spokesman reminded reporters that the hundred thousand people who legally owned machine guns before 1986 are unaffected by the law . No kidding .  | February 4 , 1991 I just found out that our family is no longer what the Census Bureau calls a traditional American family , and I want everyone to know that this is not our fault . We now find ourselves included in the statistics that are used constantly to show the lamentable decline of the typical American household from something like Ozzie and Harriet and the kids to something like a bunch of kooks and hippies . I want everyone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh sure , we have our peculiarities , but we are not kooks . Also , we are not hippies . We have no children named Goodness . I am the first one to admit that reasonable people may differ on how to characterize a couple of my veteran sportcoats , and there may have been a remark or two passed in the neighborhood from time to time about the state of our front lawn . But no one has ever seriously suggested that we are hippies . In fact , most people find us rather traditional . My wife and I have a marriage certificate , although I ca n't say I know exactly where to put my hands on it right at the moment . We have two children . We have a big meal at Christmas . We put on costumes at Halloween . ( What about the fact that I always wear an ax murderer 's mask on Halloween ? That happens to be one of the peculiari-ties . ) We make family decisions in the traditional Ameri-  | can family way , which is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . We lose a lot of socks in the wash . At our house , the dishes are done and the garbage is taken out regularly  --  after the glass and cans and other recyclable materials have been separated out . We 're not talking about a commune here . So why has the Census Bureau begun listing us with households that consist of , say , the ex-stepchild of some-one 's former marriage living with someone who is under the mistaken impression that she is the aunt of somebody or other ? Because the official definition of a traditional American family is two parents and one or more children under age eighteen . Our younger daughter just turned nineteen . Is that our fault ? As it happens , I did everything in my power to keep her from turning nineteen . When our daughters were about two and five , I decided that they were at the perfect age , and I looked around for some sort of freezing process that might keep them there . I discovered that there was no such freezing process on the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technology would come along by and by , I renewed my investigation several times during their childhoods  --  they always seemed to be at the perfect age  --  but the freezing process never surfaced . Meanwhile , they kept getting older at what seemed to me a constantly accelerating rate . Before you could say " Zip up your jacket , " the baby turned nineteen . What 's a parent to do ? Ask for an easement . That 's what a parent 's to do . When I learned about the Census Bureau 's definition of a traditional family  --  it was mentioned in an Associated Press story about how the latest census shows the traditional family declining at a more moderate pace than " the rapid and destabilizing rate " at which it declined between 1970 and 198o  --  it occurred to me that we could simply p 65 explain the situation to the Census Bureau and ask that an exception be made in our case . I realize that the Census Bureau would probably want to send out an inspector . I would acknowledge to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but remind him that we have been assured by more experienced parents that we can absolutely count on their return . I would take the position , in other words , that we are just as traditional as any American family , just slightly undermanned at the moment  --  like a hockey team that has a couple of guys in the penalty box but is still a presence on the ice . We could show the official our Christmas tree decorations and our Halloween costumes and a lot of single socks . We might , in the traditional American way , offer him a cup of coffee and a small bribe . I have n't decided for sure to approach the Census Bureau . For one thing , someone might whisper in the inspector 's ear that I have been heard to refer to my older daughter 's room  --  the room where we now keep the exercise bike  --  as " the gym , " and that might take some explaining . Also , I have n't discussed this matter with my wife . I would , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 18 , 1991 If I ever had any doubts about whether history truly repeats itself  --  as opposed to just clearing its throat now and then  --  they were put to rest by reading a recent item in the New York Times about people buying geckos for cockroach control . The last time I dealt with the subject of geckos as hired killers was 1971 . Nixon was in the White House . The college-tuition daughter was three years old and thought all my jokes were funny . ( Yes , I may have told her the one about why the chicken crossed the road . Yes , I may have left the impression that I made up that joke . What are children for ? ) The report in the Times that geckos are again popular made a believer out of me on the question of history being just as repetitious as my Uncle Harry . I now find myself glancing over my shoulder regularly , half expecting the jitterbug to boogie out from around the corner . Geckos , I should explain to those who have somehow forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lizards that love to eat cockroaches . ( As my Aunt Rosie says , there 's no accounting for taste  --  an aphorism she sometimes uses to explain how she happened to marry my Uncle Harry . ) In 1971 , some people I knew had bought a gecko and set it loose in their apartment on the West Side of Manhattan with instructions to take no prisoners . p 67 When I wrote about this situation at the time , I disguised the names of the gecko owners  --  I called them Ralph and Myrna Cole  --  so that they would n't be revealed as people whose apartment was , as my friend Jane 's mother always puts it , " crawling with cockroaches . " You may remember my friend Jane from my account of what happened when she had reason to believe that a cockroach had climbed into her computer . I did n't mention her last name , in order to guard against the possibility that her mother , who lives in Sioux City , Iowa , would get the impression that Jane 's apartment was crawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in Sioux City , Iowa ; that 's part of the disguise . ) Having been reminded of geckos by the piece in the Times , I told Jane that the next time she sees a cockroach crawl into her computer , maybe the thing to do is to send a gecko in there after it . Jane told me that she is trying to forget the entire experience . She said that if I mention her in connection with this , she 'd appreciate it if I referred to her as Blanche , just in case . Anyway , when I read that geckos were back , I immediately thought of phoning the people I called Ralph and Myrna Cole to find out whether they still had their gecko . Of course , I was n't certain that such a thing was possible , since I 'm not right up to the minute on the lifespan of a gecko . Also , as I remembered it , the Coles had n't been absolutely certain that they still had their gecko in 1971 . Geckos are known to be terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage , since an owner is not likely to wake up and find himself eyeball to eyeball with one  --  and when I interviewed the Coles they had n't seen theirs in weeks . So maybe my phone call would find them in the midst of mourning their gecko or in the midst of looking under couches and behind cushions , still trying to find  | the little rascal . But this is the kind of tough phone call we reporters are trained to make . I picked up the phone . Then I realized that I did n't know who they were . It had been so long ago that I could n't remember their real names . " Maybe they were the Conrads , " my wife said . " From the looks of the Conrads ' apartment , I 've always suspected that it 's crawling with cockroaches . " " Not the Conrads , " I said . " In 1971 the Conrads were still living in that commune in Vermont that gradually evolved into a shared summer house . " " Maybe the Johnsons , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anteaters got fashionable , they 'd buy an ant-eater . " " The Bartletts ! " I said . That 's not their real name , which I wo n't mention because what reminded me of them is that I 've always thought Don Bartlett looks a little bit like an anteater . " But the Bartletts have been divorced for years , " my wife said . " What a pity , " I said . " This would have been a little milestone for them  --  the return of the gecko . Maybe they 'll get together again . " " I do n't think so , " my wife said . " I think it finally occurred to Edna Bartlett that Don looks a bit like an anteater . " " You never can tell , " I said . " History often repeats itself . "  | February 25 , 1991 It 's true that Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis and I can both bark like a dog , but we have very little else in common . I just wanted to get that off my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prince Johannes von Thurn and Taxis , who died last December , managed to run through a couple of billion dollars ( leaving only five hundred million or so ) while hanging around with that gang of rich glitz-hounds and Eurotrash party-trotters and titled deadbeats that a friend of mine used to call " the useless tassel at the end of so-ciety . " That 's not my sort of thing at all . Ordinarily I would n't have even said anything about any of this . I 'm not the sort of person who sits around worrying about the possibility that somewhere someone might be comparing him to somebody in the Useless Tassel . ( " No , I do n't think he 's much like the late King Farouk of Egypt , although if he does n't start going light on the pasta he may get there one of these days .

" Roy circled that part and wrote next to it , " If you and she ever appear together , I would like to see it . " I should make it clear that before I gave any thought to myself I thought about Roy . I identify slightly out-ofdate copies of People magazine with dentists ' offices , and I hoped this was n't an indication that Roy was having more trouble with his teeth . We happen to go to the same dentist  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnoses always seem closely tied to his own cashflow situation . Sweeney has been madly rearranging mouths ever since his wife spotted a beach house she craved on the Jersey shore . In my own case , I have reason to believe that Sweeney is putting together a combination on the lower right  --  a root canal here , an extraction there  --  with a gold bridge in mind . He drills away with the single-mindedness of a New York real estate shark quietly accumulating a line of stores to be torn down for a particularly lucrative high-rise . If Roy was in for that sort of project , he could forget any dreams he might have had about owning a fleet of limos and a Harley . I should also say that I appreciated Roy 's kind words about my dog bark , which is my only first-rate animal imitation .

In fact , I would put my own wife in that category . Still , I was concerned . A couple of years ago , someone published a book portraying Picasso as an exceedingly unpleasant fellow , and my cousin Fred , the Wal-Mart assistant store manager and amateur watercolorist , was afraid everyone would think he is a brute just because he 's a Sunday painter . His wife , my cousin Stephanie , offered to make a public statement that Fred never abused her ( " Listen , I hardly ever see the guy " ) , but Fred said he was so upset that it was affecting his art . Maybe some people are defending Princess Gloria I'hurn and Taxis the way some people defended Picasso ( " Listen , if her dog-bark imitation is brilliant , her personal life is simply irrelevant to the discussion of her as an art-ist " ) . I do n't want to bark a duet with her anyway . I want to make it clear that I have never even known any royalty of any kind , unless you count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as the Prince of Suave . Princess Gloria and I are simply not alike . In fact , since Sweeney Todd , D.D.S. , had his last go at the lower right , I 'm not even certain I can bark like a dog .  | March 18 , 1991 Around the first of the year , the New York Times published a list of geographical name changes that took place over the past decade  --  the change in 1984 , for example , that transformed the Republic of Upper Volta into Burkina Faso  --  and I 've been studying the list ever since . I may have lost interest in the names of the Bush Administration cabinet secretaries by now , but when it comes to geography , I like to be up to the minute . As you must have realized , geography is my best subject . I 've often mentioned how upset I get every time some survey-taker comes back with strong indications that many American high school students would probably identify Alabama as the capital of Chicago . If a surveytaker asked me to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would name its capital . I would tell him the names of rivers that run through Alabama , plus their tributaries . If I happened to be in a show-offy mood , I would toss in major mineral resources . The list in the Times was credited to Zoltan Grossman , Mapping Specialists Ltd. of Madison , Wisconsin ( Madison is , of course , the state capital , and had a 1980 population of 178,180 ) . I have no idea how the company is organized , but in my mind it exists as a man named Zoltan Grossman  --  a man with a cosmopolitan air and a slight Middle European accent and a feeling for geogra-  | phy so instinctive that the very mention of Burkina Faso causes him to mouth the word " Ouagadougou " ( the capital ) and maybe even the word " manganese " ( the major mineral resource ) . Going over the list , I sometimes carry on a sort of imaginary conversation with Zoltan Grossman . In my mind we are sitting at a sidewalk cafe in some unnamed European city  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on catching the change of Brunei to Brunei I ) arussalam , a change a lot of geography hounds missed , and I somehow work into that compliment a reminder of my observation some years ago that South Yemen was not , in fact , south of Yemen  --  an observation that I like to think may have had something to do with their eventual union . Grossman smiles , nods almost imperceptibly , and tips his cup of espresso to me in an ironic little salute . Sometimes , in those conversations , I allow myself an occasional small complaint about how the list of name changes was presented . Although I appreciated being told that in 1986 the rivers in Burkina Faso that were formerly called the Black , Red , and White Volta rivers became the Mouhoun , Nzinon , and Nakanbe rivers , I tell Grossman , I would have appreciated it even more if I had been told whether this was in tribute to some Burkina Faso patriots ( " General Nzinon is a loyal supporter of President Mou-houn " ) or simply a translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language of the Mossi , Burkina Faso 's largest tribe ( " If the general attacks on a mouhoun night , the Nakanbe will run nzinon with blood " ) . " Perhaps you 're right , " Grossman says . " And perhaps we should have offered the same sort of explanation concerning the change of the name of Greenland in 1982 to Kalaallitt Nunaat . " " Touche , Monsieur Grossman , " I say . Grossman ,  | that sly devil , is obviously aware that in a column in 1987 , a full five years after the official change , I referred to Kalaallitt Nunaat as Greenland  --  an embarrassing mistake that made me feel like some kalaallitt reporter who had just nunaated his first job . In general , though , Grossman and I do not try to catch each other in errors . We sit for hours at the cafe , chewing over such questions as whether the presence of so many double letters in the Greenlandic language might mean that an appropriate place for the annual conference of the Twins Society would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time talking about how Cambodia changed to Kampuchea and then , before some of the atlas people could catch up , back to Cambodia again . We might speculate on the parliamentary debate that resulted in the Federation of St. Kitts-Nevis changing its name to the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis . Were there , for instance , people known as Hyphenists and people known as Antihyphenists ? Grossman , as I imagine him , is constantly disappointed in the United States , his adopted home , where names hardly ever change . When he gets nostalgic , he talks of the time that Hot Springs , New Mexico , changed its name to Truth or Consequences , New Mexico , which was in 1950 . " Perhaps they 'll change back someday , " he sometimes says in a reflective moment . " I 'll believe it when I see it , Herr Grossman , " I say . " I was raised in the Show-Me State  --  Missouri . " " Jefferson City , " Grossman says quietly . " Zinc and lead . "  | March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further confirmation of those lamentations we 're always hearing about the dismal state of ignorance most Americans are in when it comes to science . After all , I 'm one of the people they 're talking about . In fact , I 've been straightforward about owning up to my own failings in this area . I admitted publicly that until recently I was under the impression that Orion was spelled O'Ryan , and had always found it puzzling that there was one constellation of Irish descent . I admitted publicly that for a long time I took it for granted that decaffeinated coffee was produced by a labor-intensive industry whose principal tool was tiny tweezers and whose principal environmental hazard was the accumulation of caffeine slagheaps so potent that a curious dog who sniffed at one would be awake for eight or ten years . What I 'm saying is that I 've never claimed to be a whiz at this stuff myself . Still , even I was shocked by the latest evidence of scientific illiteracy  --  the results of a little survey I carried on myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this column that I often take people who are visiting New York to see the Frog Mountains of Chinatown . ( We all have our own ideas of the big sights . ) Two restaurants I know of in Chinatown hold frogs in the sort of wall tanks  | that Chinese restaurants ordinarily use for the display of fish , and in both cases the frogs are so insistent on moving back from the glass and to the right that they climb up on one another to form small , squirmy piles in the corner  --  the so-called Frog Mountains of Chinatown . In the course of talking about what a grand tourist sight a frog mountain can be , I mentioned that the visitors I take to Chinatown have varying theories about why the frogs move back and to the right  --  one theory being that all frogs are born in the same place , a pond in southern Indiana , and that these particular frogs , sensing what must be in store for a frog being held in a tank in a Chinese restaurant , are trying desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that was silly . For one thing , it 's common knowledge that southern Indiana does n't have that many frogs . Also , even though the frogs in one restaurant seem to be trying to move toward southern Indiana , the frogs in the other restaurant are pointed more or less in the direction of Spartanburg , South Carolina . I only mentioned that theory about the pond in Indiana in the hope that it would provoke people to offer better theories . I figured I would get a lot of letters that began , " You 're thinking of eels all being born in the same place , " and would then go on to tell me the real reason frogs are always so desperate to move back and to the right  --  something about whether frogs use the right or left side of their brains , maybe , or something about how all frogs are just naturally a little lopsided . This was n't one of those dumb riddles ; I really wanted to know . Nobody sent any theories . Oh sure , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' legs taste just like chicken and the predictable letter from a frogs ' - rights advocate who told me that anyone worth his salt would have smashed the wall-tank glass to p 77 liberate the imprisoned frogs . And yes , I got the predictable letter from some political nut telling me that the use of " frog " as a mildly derogatory term for Frenchman derives from the fact that when Frenchmen are frightened they tend to move back and toward the right  --  an example being the instant retreat and the formation of the fascist government in Vichy at the beginning of the Second World War . But nobody told me why frogs move back and to the right . The only letter that contained what you might call a scientific theory said , " Anybody who ever for even a minute thought that caffeine was removed from coffee beans with tiny tweezers is a nitwit . " No wonder the Japanese beat us to Nintendo . M A S S E X I T May 13 , 1991 Right at the start , let 's clear up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a lot better off if every single person who was in Au Bar in Palm Beach at 3 A.M. on a Good Friday  --  or any other morning  --  was deported to New Zealand . What I really said was this : even though I would never be in favor of such a draconian measure , which would violate all of my most cherished beliefs about due process and civil liberties , I think it 's interesting to speculate , strictly theoretically , about whether such a mass deportation would be a net gain for the society . That 's not saying the same thing . In the first place , it 's important that this is only theoretical . In the second place , do n't forget what I said about net gain : I 'll admit that some people of value would be swept up when the Immigration and Naturalization Service authorities showed up at Au Bar and loaded everyone in paddy wagons whose drivers had strict instructions to go directly to the airport . I would guess , for instance , that a few innocent college kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are likely to wander into any saloon that has a light on at three in the morning . These college kids would n't be there because they aspired to the hot Palm Beach bar scene of particularly drunken coupon-clippers and assorted Eurotrash . They  | might just want another beer . I 'd hate to see them snatched up and , without even a chance to make a phone call or stop at home for a clean shirt , shipped off to some sheep farm three hundred miles from Auckland . There is also the matter of Senator Kennedy , apparently an Au Bar regular , whose departure would be , in the opinion of many , a loss for the Senate . I have to admit that long before the incident in Palm Beach I often found myself engaged in idle speculation about mass deportation . At times I could imagine the INS cops showing up at some nightspot ; that was particularly true when Studio 54 was in business . Sometimes I would organize the operation by what people did or what they owned . " Attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shower . " Attention , all owners of stretch limousines . This is a recall . Not the car  --  you . " Toting up net gain is not difficult . In the case of Au Bar , you simply put on one side of the scales , say , these students ( who could someday be productive citizens ) plus Senator Kennedy 's diligent work on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee . On the other side you put the drunken coupon-clippers and assorted Eurotrash . Then , strictly theoretically , you decide whether mass deportation would represent a net gain . I hasten to say that this is not meant as a judgment on either the alleged attacker or the alleged victim in the incident that took place at the Kennedy house . I do n't know which side of the scales either one of them would be on . Even if I did , I would n't follow the example of the New York Times , which decided that it owed its readers not only the name of the alleged victim but such details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of traffic tickets and had a child out of wedlock and , according to an anonymous source , had " a little wild streak " in high school .  | One problem with that approach , it seems to me , is that the Times may now feel it owes its readers a background piece on practically anyone who reports that he has been a victim of a crime  --  a mugging ( " Although he is nearly six feet tall , Mr. Cranston has what several acquaintances of his describe as not a very purposeful walk ' and in high school was , in the view of one classmate who did not wish to be identified , sort of a nerd ' " ) or even a burglary ( " Mr. Molson acknowledged that when he and his wife were in high school together , her locker combination was an open secret in the junior class " ) . Also , the Times mentioned the alleged victim 's name because NBC had done it , and NBC did it because a supermarket tabloid had done it . That sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press together , which worries me , just in case there is ever a point at which people who have fantasies about mass deportation can make them come true . I can envision someone announcing , " Attention , all press people : stand in front of your doors for immediate pickup . "  | May 2o , 1991 Parents who have been worried about their children being turned into mindless layabouts by rock-music lyrics will be relieved to hear that , according to the latest scientific studies , teenagers pay virtually no attention to the lyrics of rock songs . In other words , just what is turning these teenagers into mindless layabouts is still open to question . I should also say , in the spirit of generational fairness , that there have been no studies so far to see what is turning so many parents into mindless layabouts . That is probably a much longer story . According to an article I read in the Washington Post , one of the most thorough studies ever done on the impact of rock lyrics was recently completed by two psychologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lorraine Prinsky . They found that most teenagers do n't listen closely to the words of rock songs , do n't catch a lot of what they do hear , and do n't much care one way or the other . When the teenagers in the survey were asked why they listen to a rock song , " I want to listen to the words " finished dead last . This information should change one of the standard discussions that parents and teenagers have about rock music  --  a discussion traditionally carried on in the family automobile at a time when the music blaring from a  | boom box in the back seat is loud enough to turn the windshield wipers on and off . Parent ( in a patient and mature tone ) : I ca n't imagine why you listen to that moronic garbage . Teenager : Uhnnn . Parent : It 's just a lot of thugs making as much noise as they can . Teenager : Nghh . Parent : Half the time , you ca n't even make out the words to the song anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the latest study indicates that this makes no difference whatsoever in my enjoyment of this art form . That 's right . Teenagers do n't care about the words . They listen to the lyrics of rock songs about as carefully as their parents listen to the lyrics of " The Star-Spangled Banner . " The California study found that the messages supposedly encoded in some rock songs  --  exhortations to become dope fiends and burn down cities and worship Satan and engage in hideous sexual excesses and leave the dinner table without being asked to be excused and that sort of thing  --  were lost on teenagers , even when the researchers furnished printouts of the lyrics for the teenagers to peruse . This is , of course , good news for parents and discouraging news for anybody who has put a lot of effort into trying to use rock lyrics to encourage teenagers to do wicked things . Since teenagers do n't listen carefully to the lyrics , they tend to form their opinion of what the song is about from the title . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is described by the Post as having " in every verse explicit references to despair and disillusion-ment . " But kids from fourth grade through college who were tested by researchers from the University of Cali-  | fornia at Los Angeles were mostly under the impression that " Born in the USA " was a patriotic song . These results should n't surprise anybody . Most grownups do n't get much past the title of anything , which is why title-writing is such an art . The military is particularly adept at titles . The invasion of Panama , for instance , was called Operation Just Cause . Think of what the public impression of that episode would have been if the Pentagon had chosen a name that would have been , in fact , much less subject to differences of opinion : Operation Tiny Country . Think of how the public view of the war in the Persian Gulf might have differed if our military effort to drive Iraqis from Kuwait had been gilled not Operation Desert Storm but Operation Restore Despot . The results of these rock-lyrics studies seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only draw teenagers ' attention to something they might otherwise ignore  --  sort of like marking the spines of innocent-looking novels , " Warning : This Book Has Some Good Parts . " The results also mean that concerned citizens would be wasting their time mounting a campaign to encourage songwriters to compose more uplifting lyrics . That 's a shame . I was sort of looking forward to the forces of good coming up with a song that featured endless repetition of some lyric like " I wan na clean my room " or " I appreciate the great burden of responsibility my father carries and the sacrifices he 's made on behalf of me and my siblings , and I have only the greatest respect for him . " With the right tune , we now know , that might have made the charts , but nobody would have been listening any-way.  | May 27 , 1991 It 's been more than two months since I read in the Washington Post that in Germany the government has to approve the name of your child . I think my response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move through in response to a family catastrophe , beginning with denial and going on to anger . I now remember specifically that the first words I uttered upon reading the item were " Get serious ! " That 's right . I thought it was a joke . For a moment it occurred to me that the entire edition of the Washington Post I was reading might be what we used to call at the college paper ( usually on April Fools ' Day ) a yuk issue , and I turned back to the front page to see if it had headlines like GORBACHEV NEW HOST OF HOLLYWOOD SQUARES and SUNUNU SAID TO BE UNCERTAIN ON WHETHER TO REAPPOINT BUSH and HELMS DEFENDS PORN THEATER VISIT AS " RESEARCH . " But the front page was obviously real , and so was the story I had just read . In Germany , if the clerk in charge of such matters at your city hall does n't approve of the name you propose to give your newborn baby , you have to name the baby something else . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question of the clerk protecting the child . If they tried that in this country , the question would be , Who 's going to protect the clerk ? p 85 In Germany , on the other hand , there are all sorts of regulations like this that the citizenry docilely ac-cepts  --  although the Post piece did report that a doctor in Dusseldorf recently went to court to challenge a law that makes it a crime to take a shower after ten in the evening . ( I know what you 're saying now . You 're saying , " Get serious ! " That means you 're in the denial stage . I suggest that you go to your public library , look up the Washington Post for March 25 , 1991 , and turn to page Ai4 . Then you can move on to anger . ) Next time you 're assured that we have a strong cultural unity with the countries of Western Europe , keep in mind that Germany has laws against taking a shower after 10 P.M. In Germany , name clerks routinely turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child is a girl or a boy , for instance , or names that might sound unfamiliar to the other children at school or names that mean something odd in the language of a foreign country that the child in question will almost certainly never visit . Let 's say that you want to name your new son Leslie because you have reason to believe that your rich and essentially vicious Uncle Leslie would be so touched by such a gesture that he would leave you a bundle to see little Leslie through college . ( I 'm using American names because I do n't want to irritate you with unfamiliar German names at a time when this thing has already put you in a bad mood . ) The clerk says absolutely not : little Leslie could be mistaken for a female . You say that if enough of Uncle Leslie 's boodle is involved , you do n't care if little Leslie could be mistaken for a parking meter . The clerk says no . You appeal to a court . The judge upholds the clerk . You get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You get arrested . Now this kid of yours has real problems : he does n't have a name and one of his parents is in the clink.  | I do n't mean that I approve of parents giving their children silly names . My views on this matter are on the record . I have stated publicly that naming a child after a store  --  Tiffany , for instance , or Kmart  --  is probably unwise . When my friend Ruthie , who was four at the time , said she wanted to name the new baby her mother was expecting Static Cling , I argued against it . Twenty years ago , I counseled that Sunshine was not a good name for a child , although perhaps perfect for a detergent . I disapproved of the slogan names favored by Chinese Communists in the fifties because , let 's face it , Assist the Brave Workers of Korea is no name to have on the play-ground . But if Sunshine feels more like a Norbert when he grows up  --  maybe he thinks Norbert is more appropriate for someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can simply change his name . His mother , who changed her name from Maxine to Starglow when she dropped out of college in 1971 to become a mushroom gatherer , can still picture that sweetly dirty little toddler as Sunshine . Should any of this have anything to do with government clerks ? Get serious .  | June 1o , 1991 The other day I managed to get a glimpse of the future and the past at the same time : I saw an item reporting that Barry Goldwater had gone back to being publicly pro-choice and another item reporting that the most recently transcribed tapes from Richard Nixon 's Oval Office reveal him once more as a vindictive , unscrupulous paranoid . It 's always comforting for a citizen to come upon confirmation that the nation 's political leaders remain consistent in their character and beliefs . Nixon was caught by his own taping system questioning his staff about the uplifting concerns we 've come to identify with him : who was and who was n't Jewish among defendants in the Chicago show trial of those who opposed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegally and used against Democrats , whether some Teamsters could be induced to beat up war demonstrators . It was , in other words , what students of the Nixon presidency have come to think of as the usual Oval Office chitchat . The release of the White House tapes gradually over the years has turned out to be a trial for poor Nixon as he tries to rehabilitate himself with ponderous pronouncements on foreign policy . He 's like a mobster who , seeking respectability as he gets on in years , talks at great length to the dignitaries he has invited to tea about his  | legitimate business enterprises and his far-flung charities but keeps getting interrupted by flunkies who want to know where to deposit the loansharking take or how to dispose of the body of a business associate with whom there was a small disagreement . Goldwater , whose moment in the sun was in the days before you had to hold up a placard with an aborted fetus on it in order to get the Republican nomination , apparently did n't have much to say on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's main man . Now he has publicly given his support to those Republicans who believe that the party ought to have room for people who are pro-choice  --  a position that the anti-abortion zealots treat as they might treat the decision of a prominent vestryman who announces that he is resigning his duties at the church in order to devote more time to his hobby of consorting with a pack of murderers . Naturally , all this got me thinking about George Bush . I do n't mean for a moment that a tape recorder under his desk might pick up the sort of ranting that took place in the Nixon White House . It was class resentment that gave Nixon 's whining that exquisite timbre , and Bush , of course , has none of that , having himself been born into the class Nixon resented . Bush is also presumably above Nixon 's yahoo antiSemitism , although he has consistently been a promoter of Fred Malek , the White House aide who was instructed by Nixon , on a previously released tape , to gather up the names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presumably for the purpose of purging the members of the Jewish conspiracy that Nixon fantasized was responsible for some unwelcome quarterly numbers . Ma-lek 's defenders say he stalled before furnishing the names , hoping Nixon would forget  --  meaning that his courage in resisting a repugnant order could be cele- p 89 orated on his tombstone with the phrase " He Had to Be Asked Twice . " Bush , of course , would never stoop to sending thugs i ? hard hats to break up antiwar demonstrations . John Sununu and C. Boyden Gray , the people he sent to break up a meeting between business and civil rights leaders t hat might have brought agreement on the civil rights bill and thus robbed the Administration of the quota issue to use as its Willie Horton in the 1992 campaign , are always seen in coats and ties . And nobody in Washington thinks a gentleman like Bush is a real hater , the way the people the Willie Horton ad was meant to appeal to are haters . After he retires , I can see him putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College Fund , to which he and his father before him have contributed , and expressing some mild regret about what some aides did , without his knowledge , that might have seemed like race-baiting . I can also see him returning to the old pro-choice position he had before he was made to understand that a pro-choice candidate could n't be Reagan 's running mate in 1980 . Does anybody think it 's necessary for George Bush to end his days as the only Eastern Establishment Episcopalian in the entire country who is publicly pro-life ? No , I can see Bush returning to the moderate Republicanism of his friends and relatives  --  unscathed and , of course , untaped . No wonder Nixon resents the upper class .  | July 15 , 1991 According to the Toronto Globe and Mail , which got its information from Reuters , " A young man in Bangkok , denied a motorcycle by his parents , locked himself in his room and has stayed there for 22 years . " Talk about stubborn ! When I read about the young man in Bangkok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I wanted to see if it was possible that the official world record for longest teenage snit could be held by someone other than an American kid  --  but no record was listed . Even if there had been , would a forty-two-year-old man be eligible ? Reuters apparently ran across the long-term snit story in a mass-circulation Thai-language newspaper called the Daily News , which said that the young man who was denied the motorcycle , Dan Jaimun , permits only his younger sister to visit him in his room . At this point the younger sister must be , as my father would have put it , no spring chicken herself . Meals are left outside the door . According to the item in the Globe and Mail , " The parents of Dan Jaimun tearfully asked readers of the Daily News to come up with ideas on how they might persuade their son to emerge from his small bedroom . " p 91 Although my wife is not a reader of the Daily News iii Thailand  --  and therefore technically not one of those asked for advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind enough to offer the benefit of her experience the moment I informed her of the situation . " Quit leaving the meals outside his door , " she said . " And give him the motorcycle . " I think that 's called the old carrot-and-stick approach , and it might do the trick at the Jaimun household . On questions of how to handle these family matters I have always found my wife to be very sound . A few years ago , for instance , I benefited from her observation that there must be better ways to get teenagers to quit saying " like " at the dinner table ( " Like , he was like , Like , O.K. ' " ) than to threaten to place them in foster care . Still , I told my wife I was n't altogether certain that her plan would work in the case of Dan Jaimun . " The possibility of not leaving Dan 's food outside his bedroom door must have occurred to Mr. and Mrs. Jaimun within the first five or ten years , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threatened end of room service by saying , Fine . Perfect . I 'll starve to death . Life without a motorcycle is n't worth living anyway . ' " " They could try leaving meals of just carrots outside his door , " said one of my daughters , who hates carrots . When she 's talking about the carrot-and-stick approach , the carrot is meant literally , and it 's the stick . Around our neighborhood , there were any number of inventive ideas for getting Dan out of his room . Mr. Stone , who lives down the street , said that the Jaimuns should hire some motorcyclists to rev their motors outside the house and shout , loud enough for Dan Jaimun to hear , " Mrs. Jaimun , can Dan come out to play ? " Mrs. Johnson , who lives across the street and had always struck  | me as a gentle sort , said , " In such situations , I have always found that one effective and humane tool a parent should consider employing is tear gas . " What surprised me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a number of people did n't think luring Dan from his room was necessarily the goal that Mr. and Mrs. Jaimun should concentrate on . For instance , Mr. Collins , who lives a couple of houses down , said , " Children must learn that when you say no you mean no , and for some children it takes a long time for that to sink in . " Mrs. Stone , who has reared three children , said , " The important thing is to make sure he keeps that room neat and tidy . If you train a child to keep his room neat and tidy , everything else falls into place . "  | I my 29 , 1991 I went to Paris , France , and got bitten by a chigger . Was I upset ? Yes , I think you could say I was a little upset . I have spoken before about what my wife insists on calling my morbid fear of chiggers . I have spoken before about how the itch of a chigger bite is equal to approximately seven milamoses ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand for the itch power of a thousand mosquito bites ) . I have revealed that the itch of a chigger bite lasts just short of eternity and that the only thing that can stop it  --  sometimes  --  is amputation . I have explained that my wife ca n't appreciate any of this because she 's from the East and chiggers exist only in the Midwest and the South  --  during the summer , particularly in Kansas City , Missouri , in the tall grass next to my cousin Kenny 's house . If chiggers exist only in the Midwest and the South , you say , how did I get a chigger bite in Paris , France ? That 's the whole point . That 's why I think you could say I was a little upset . I had thought I was safe . Am I really saying that I went to Paris to escape chiggers ? Almost . What I mean is that for someone who grew up in the Midwest , part of the pleasure of foreign travel is knowing that you 're in a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , Sedalia , Missouri , is on the top of the Eiffel Tower , looking out over the  | whole City of Light , what runs through his mind is , " Even if they were around here , they could n't get this high . " You think that 's weird ? You think the traveler from Sedalia should be thinking about the beauty of Paris or the place of Paris in the history of Western civilization ? Then you 've never been bitten by a chigger . Also , part of everyone 's sense of security is the comforting notion that certain kinds of disasters only happen somewhere else . When the anchorman reports that some fabulously expensive houses perched in the Hollywood Hills have been carried off by a mudslide , people on the Great Plains breathe a sigh of relief that someone living on an absolutely flat surface is free from the threat of sliding mud . Once , during some hard times in midwestern agriculture , I asked a wheat farmer in Nebraska if he saw any bright spots , and he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves . " By the same token , a Hollywood producer who grew up in Hutchinson , Kansas , may wake up every morning haunted by his problems  --  his deal may never be made , his wife may leave with the pool boy ? and cheer himself up enough to get out of bed with the thought that the day will surely pass without a tornado . We depend on these things staying where they belong . " It ca n't be a chigger , " my wife said . " Chiggers are only in the Midwest and the South . You told me that 's why you moved to New York . " " Maybe it came over in somebody 's cuff , " I said . " The man sitting next to me on the plane looked suspiciously like someone I used to know from Conway , Arkansas . Or maybe they really do have chiggers in Paris , France , and the government has suppressed the information because otherwise the tourist industry would collapse . I wish I could understand French better . If the  | radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to worry about than I thought . " Then a friend of ours who lives in France informed us that what I had was an aoutat bite  --  common in France , particularly in the month of August . He even showed us the definition in a French dictionary : the larva of something the French call a trombidion , which does sound itchy . " Does n't that make you feel better ? " my wife asked . " It would , " I said , " except for this itch . " A week or so after we got home , I happened to be up very early one morning  --  I was up very early because of the itching  --  and I got curious about the word " trom-bidion . " I could n't find a French-English dictionary , but , just on a hunch , I looked it up in an English dictionary . I found the word " trombidiasis . " It was defined as an infestation with chiggers . So they do have chiggers in Paris , France . Probably tornados , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on crumbling away . Were there also chiggers in New York , simply covered over temporarily by concrete ? Should I move back to Kansas City ? Or would I be at risk there from tidal waves ?  | August 19 , 1991 Just as we thought things were calming down a bit internationally , a Chinese academic , Professor Ling Hong-ling , has gone and upset the Scots by claiming that golf was invented in China . I know what you 're thinking : this is going to remind the Russians that they used to claim they invented baseball , which will provoke the English ( who really did invent baseball but got tired a long time ago of arguing with people from Cooperstown ) to talk about having invented ice hockey , which will enrage the Canadians ( who hardly ever get mad ) and provoke the Lithuanians into claiming the invention of darts , and that will lead into a sort of chain reaction of claims and counterclaims until-powee ! ? World War III . I wish I had some reassuring words about that possibility , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Toronto Globe and Mail by Carl Honore , which is where I read all about this  --  the Scots are angry as hornets .

" It is only a matter of time , I think , before some Scot- p 97 tish golfer gets mad enough to point out that Professor Ling Hong-ling 's name sounds more like a Ping-Pong match than a round of golf . Writing in the Australian Society for Sports History Bulletin  --  a journal , I should admit , that I might have missed had the alert Honore not pointed the way  --  Profcssor Hong-ling concluded from pottery depictions and murals and other evidence that a game very much like modern golf was played in China around the middle of the tenth century , five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was called chiuwan , or hitting ball  --  which , you have to admit , is a much more logical name for the sport than golf , even though , during my brief fling at it many years ago , I often missed the ball completely . Burnet tried in the Globe and Mail piece to explain away the pottery and murals : " If you take any kind of patterned plate or blanket or stained glass and play around with it long enough , you 'll soon find a man holding a club and hitting a ball towards a hole . " Being an open-minded person , I tried this theory with an old patterned plate , and it did n't work . After looking at the design for twenty minutes ( some of that time squinty-eyed ) , what I thought I saw was a man in an undershirt eating a herring . What I 'm saying is that Burnet 's attempt to explain away Ling Hong-ling 's murals may say less about the history of golf than it does about Burnet , or me . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early traveler to China brought golf back to Europe , the way Marco Polo is said to have brought back to Italy what Italians came to call pasta and the way more recent travelers from the West have brought back hot tips on how a government can get rid of students who are demonstrating for democracy in large public squares .  | As you might imagine , this early-traveler theory does not have a big following in Scotland , where , according to the Globe and Mail , " Golf sits snugly alongside clan tartan , whiskey and haggis as a symbol of Scottish ingenu-ity . " I should say right off the bat that I have tasted haggis  --  it is described in my dictionary , rather discreetly , as a pudding " made of the heart , liver , and lungs of a sheep or a calf , minced with suet , onions , oatmeal , and seasonings and boiled in the stomach of the animal " ? and if the Scots are worried about somebody else taking credit for inventing it , I think I can put their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're also overreacting in talking about the threat this may represent to the Scottish industry that is based on foreigners going over there to play golf on Scottish courses . Rich Americans and Japanese do not go to Scotland , wearing funny costumes and lugging golf clubs , because they believe that golf was invented by the Scots ; they go there because they like the whisky . I do believe that if the Scots will just calm down , we can ride this one out . I think it should start with Bobby Burnet apologizing for the harsh language he 's used about Professor Ling Hong-ling . They should meet like gentlemen , perhaps over a round of hitting ball .  | September 9 , 1991 This would be a good time to stop sending me household hints on how to avoid losing one sock from a pair in the wash . I do n't mean to seem unappreciative . I do value your concern . But I think this would be a good time to stop . Please . I hope it does n't sound ungrateful for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some weeks ago , I 'll admit , I did mention that many single socks had been lost at our house and that installing the washer-dryer right across from the bedroom rather than in the basement had no effect whatsoever on this phenomenon . This was reported , though , in the course of explaining why I did n't find it surprising that a magazine I write for lost seventytwo boxes of archives while moving from a building in midtown Manhattan to another building right across the street . The point was not that I was searching for a way to reduce sock loss . The point was that our experience with the relocated washer-dryer , like the magazine 's experience in moving the boxes , had confirmed a law of nature . The distance a pair of socks had to travel from the machine to the sock drawer , like the distance the boxes of archives had to travel , turned out not to be relevant . As in any number of other endeavors , such as airplane transportation or ski-jumping , the difficult part is at the begin- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a law of nature being confirmed . It just happens to be called the Law of the Single Sock . So  --  and I hope I 'm not sounding bossy here  --  if you wanted to contribute something from your own experience to the discussion , it might have been appropriate to write about some other confirmation of the Law of the Single Sock . You might have written about the time you filled a mold with brass for the bust you were making of your filthy-rich and aging and childless Uncle Hiram . Waiting for the brass to harden ( the middle ) was easy . It was n't until you cracked open the mold ( the end ) that Uncle Hiram 's left ear fell off . Also  --  and I hesitate to bring this up , because I do n't want to appear to be the sort of person who ca n't let bygones be bygones  --  when I actually did write a column that was obviously meant to attract some useful household hints , you people were simply not heard from . That was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer . Jane received no help at all with her problem , and , I 'm sorry to have to report , her computer is now virtually a hollow shell . Jane manages on an old Underwood office model and occasionally shoots me a glance that I interpret as meaning , " How could your people have let me down when I was calling out for help ? " But never mind . I do n't want to dwell on the past . I did want to mention that the household hints you sent in about the problem of losing single socks in the laundry truly did  --  and I do n't want to sound cranky or ungrateful here  --  stink . That 's right : they were simply no good . Some people thought , for instance , that I could make everything O.K. by buying only one type of socks , so that I would n't have a number of pairs but rather what amounted to one large  | gaggle of identical socks . Dandy . These are people who want me described on the tennis court as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a black-tie banquet as " the suave dude in the corner sporting sweat socks . " The other principal line of advice had to do with how simple and well-organized life is if every member of a typical American family safety-pins a pair of dirty socks together before depositing them in the laundry hamper and simply removes the pin before putting on a pair of clean socks . Lovely . I hear little Jenny shouting from upstairs , " Mommy , Mommy , Jason is using his sock pins to pin my ears together ! " I see Dad  --  good old Dad , who thought moving the washer-dryer near the bedroom would solve everything  --  putting on his socks one morning when he happens to be distracted by having received so many household hints he did n't ask for , forgetting all about the safety pin , starting toward the closet to get his shoes , and falling on his face . Thanks .  | September 16 , 1991 I 've been back from the summer cottage for a while now , but I still seem to spend most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent biography of William Paley says he never had to do . These biographies of the mighty stir conflicting emotions in the ordinary reader . For instance , Paley , the founder of CBS , is revealed as a liar , a braggart , a bully , a turncoat , a philanderer , and the sort of parent who in a just world would be tossed in the slammer for dereliction of duty  --  in other words , the sort of person we 're used to reading about lately in biographies of our coun-try 's most prominent citizens . On the other hand , he never had to unpack his own car . This combination is what stirs the conflicting emotions . If you 're reading the book on the beach , you might think , " What a thoroughly loathsome human being . " But if you 're reading it in the license-renewal line at the Motor Vehicle Bureau  --  the line you 're afraid you might wait in for forty minutes only to be told that the form you 've filled out with such care is of no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box  --  you might think , a bit wistfully , " I guess Bill Paley would have had somebody to take care of this sort of thing for him . " You would be half right . As I understand it , he would have had two people to take care of that sort of thing ?  | one to stand in the line at the Motor Vehicle Bureau and one who was in charge of such matters as sending somebody down to the Motor Vehicle Bureau to stand in line . This , at least , is what I was advised by my wife , who was the person in our family actually reading the book . I wanted to get to it myself , but I was too busy unpacking the car . " When the Paleys flew from one of their houses to another , they did n't even carry a suitcase , " she said . ' Inhere were people who went ahead of them to make sure that the closets were in order and the refrigerator was stocked and there were fresh flowers in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I was lying quietly in the hammock , I might have taken it in as a marginally interesting fact about the habits of the rich . My response had to do with the fact that I was at that moment trying to balance a pile of underwear in one hand while violently pulling on a drawer that seemed to have an old American Polled Hereford Association T-shirt stuck in it in a way that prevented it from being opened more than three or four inches . I let go of the drawer and paused , still holding the pile of underwear teetering in one hand . " I really should n't be doing this , " I said to my wife . " No , you should n't , " my wife said . " If you threw out that junk you have in the lower drawer and put the underwear in there instead , you would n't keep getting that drawer jammed . " " I mean I should n't be spending my time unpacking clothes and trying to open drawers that are jammed by American Polled Hereford Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the cleaners before they close , " she said . " I finally got the washing-machine repairman to answer the phone , but I have to leave for my meeting in five minutes if I 'm going to stop at the  | post office . You should probably run over to the cleaners now and finish unpacking later , after you change that one light bulb in the hall . " " What I meant , " I said , " is that I really should have people dealing with these things for me . Did n't you tell me that until he went to check the display of some CBS magazine Paley had never been in a supermarket ? " " I do n't think you 'd be happy having someone else go to the supermarket , " my wife said . " You could n't trust anyone else to come across those weird brands of diet root beer you like . " But it would give me a lot more time . Of course , when Paley had a lot more time , he used it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted him . Maybe he would have been better off spending a little more time going to the supermarket and standing in Motor Vehicle Bureau lines . I thought about that for a while and looked at the underwear in my hand . " Is it possible that organizing one 's own underwear drawer is the path to virtue ? " I asked my wife . " Maybe you 'd better take a little break , " she said . " You 're beginning to talk funny . We can pick up the cleaning tomorrow . "  | September 30 , 1991 Here 's what I would like to say to the Rev. Ian Gregory , who has founded the Polite Society to increase the level of courtesy in England : " Buzz off , Gregory . Get lost . ' fake a walk . G'wan , get out of here . " I think that would get the good reverend 's attention . Then I would be able to tell him , without fear of being interrupted by one of his irritating interjections  --  you have to guard against such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " or " My , how very interesting " ? that there is entirely too much courtesy in England as it is . The author of the New York Times piece that brought the Rev. Gregory to my attention , William E. Schmidt , seemed quite aware that starting a Polite Society in England has a certain coals-to-Newcastle quality to it . He quotes an Italian writer named Beppe Severgnini who " reported in a recent book that Britain is the only nation he has been in where it takes four thank-you 's ' to negotiate a bus ticket . " The most irritating thank-you of the lot is the first one , which the bus conductor utters as he stands in front of the passenger , ready to collect the fare . It 's obvious that the passenger has done nothing for which he should be thanked . According to Severgnini , that first thank-you actually means " I 'm here . " It could also mean that the conductor is giving warning that he means to out-thank-  | you the passenger in order to make the passenger feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American who is intent on not being taken for one of those rude Yanks , there could be big trouble . I 've warned in the past about the dangers inherent in an American trying to out-thank-you an English person . The exchange of thank-you 's goes on and on , and the American may see no way to end it except to take out a semi-automatic rifle and shoot the English person . I suspect the Rev. Ian Gregory would take exception to this approach , to which I would reply , " Mind your own business , Gregory . " Once that put him in a frame of mind to listen , I would remind him that he lives in a country where a man who did carry coal to Newcastle would , upon arriving at the place where the coal was supposed to be delivered , hand over the bill of lading and say " Thank you . " Get this picture : A large delivery of coal has just been made to someone in Newcastle who is up to his armpits in coal . The air is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delivery wipes his brow ? which he does pretty often , since he has broken out in a cold sweat trying to imagine what he 's going to do with more coal  --  he leaves a thick black smudge on his head . And the ding-dong who has made the delivery is standing there saying " Thank you . " It makes you wonder why there is n't more violence in England . I suppose it 's a good thing that people there are n't allowed to have semiautomatic rifles . To be fair to the Rev. Ian Gregory  --  and I do n't know why I should be ; call me an old softie  --  he does distinguish between what he calls " genuinely considerate behavior " and simply littering your conversation with a lot of extraneous thank-you 's . What makes the work of  | the Polite Society necessary , he told Schmidt , is the sort of backsliding in considerate behavior that Margaret Thatcher was referring to when she said , " Graciousness is being replaced by surliness in much of everyday life . " What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eye , Gregory . " Having thus given him ample notice that I might have a differing view , I would remind him that Margaret Thatcher and genuinely considerate behavior were strangers . She was known throughout the realm , for instance , for bullying and humiliating her own cabinet ministers . What she meant by graciousness was being respectful to people like her . To which I think the proper response would be " Stick it in your ear , Mac . " Which is simply a way of saying that I think genuinely considerate behavior is the sort of thing that might be practiced by an American on a London bus who realizes that answering the conduc-tor 's thank-you with another thank-you could start a spiral into violence . Armed with that knowledge , he could actually be doing the bus conductor a favor in the long run if he answered that first absurd thank-you by saying , " Watch your mouth , buddy , " or " Listen , Mac , you looking to get your face rearranged ? " The problem is the response he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . "  | October 14 , 1991 I guess the Scandinavians who arranged to have replicas of Leif Ericsson 's boats sail from Norway to North America this year did n't realize what trouble Columbus is in . I can understand that the situation must have looked entirely different when they began putting the trip together a few years ago . They must have figured that with everybody in both North and South America planning to make a big deal in 1992 out of the five-hundredth anniversary of Christopher Columbus 's voyages , they would take the wind out of Columbus 's sails  --  apparently something God used to do with some regularity in 1492 ? by sailing here in Viking boats just before that to remind everyone which European explorer got to the Western Hemisphere hundreds of years before Columbus was born . The reason I assume their motive was to steal Co-lumbus 's thunder  --  something God never did in 1492 because He knew that thunder could scare fifteenth-century sailors right out of their skivvies  --  is that this sounds very much like part of an argument that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody can remember . The argument is over who got here first . For years , Italian-Americans have been dismissing Leif Ericsson as some pirate with horns on his hat , and Scandinavian-Americans have been referring to Colum-  | bus as " that Italian guy who got lost a few years ago . " Meanwhile , Irish-Americans say that both Ericsson and Columbus were centuries behind a monk named Brendan the Navigator , who popped over from Ireland in the middle of the sixth century . All of this is perfectly understandable , of course , in a country made up of immigrant groups who arrive with a tenuous hold on their position in an adopted land and find that a lot of people already here are prone to shout , " Go back where you came from . " It would n't surprise me to hear that some GreekAmericans have persuasive evidence that when Brendan and his party landed on the shores of Cape Cod he found that a model of the Parthenon had been built in the sand . It would n't surprise me to hear that one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea Scrolls for the first time will claim to have found a passage that could be interpreted to mean that a world across the sea was discovered in the second century by an explorer named Moishe the Lionhearted . When the recent immigrants from Southeast Asia get a generation or two as Americans under their belt , it would be perfectly natural for them to come up with an ancient Asian map of North America and remind everyone that they are not called boat people for nothing . Or it would have been perfectly natural at one time . Now , as the five-hundredth anniversary of Columbus 's voyage approaches , some Americans are making it clear that they do n't consider getting here first from the other side of the Atlantic ( or the Pacific ) anything to brag about . They say that these explorers did n't " discover " a New World , because a lot of people were already here , living in ancient and complex societies that , unlike the European society of that era , encouraged regular bathing . They say that what the explorers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sludge than you 'd feel comfortable talking about . Without getting into the question of who 's right about whether Columbus 's voyages should be called voyages of discovery and whether they should be considered cause for celebration  --  there are some places you tread only at the risk of having a lot of people shout at you , " Go back where you came from " ? I have to point out that this new argument has to affect the old argument about who got here first . If the first European on these shores brought practically nothing but trouble , who wants to claim him ? So I can see some Irish-American zealots reconsidering any campaign they might have been planning to force the capital of the Buckeye State to change its name to Brendan , Ohio . I can envision a speaker at an Ancient Order of the Hibernians meeting being cheered as , refuting charges that Brendan was responsible for turning this continent into a sinkhole , he quotes Samuel Eliot Morrison , the great historian of American settlement , to prove that the place referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Massachusetts . At the same time , a lot of people of Norwegian and Swedish and Danish descent are trying to persuade the city officials of Minneapolis that holding a large parade in October every year is the least they can do to honor the discoverer of America , Christopher Columbus . Meanwhile , the replicas of Leif Ericsson 's ships quietly slip out to sea , hoping they 'll be mistaken for Russian trawlers.  | November 4 , 1991 First I heard on the radio about a new " happy-to-be-me " ( loll , which is thicker at the waist and hips than the idealized doll that we 've been accustomed to and also has bigger feet . Then I came across a story I had clipped out of the New York Times a couple of months back about how plastic surgeons can now fill out the wrinkles on a patient 's face with fat taken from somewhere else on his body  --  a procedure that a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon called " the epitome of recycling . " Sometimes , I have to admit , I wonder about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how in a single society so many people can make money on the proposition that you are truly fine just as you are ( the self-esteem industry ) while so many other people are making money on the proposition that there are no limits to the ways you can improve the wreck you find yourself to be ( the self-improvement industry ) . Every year , two or three different pop psychologists haul in a bundle with self-help books whose titles amount to some version of You Are the Very Best Person in the Whole Wide World . Of course , it 's perfectly possible that a person who buys one of these books is not , in fact , the very best person in the whole wide world ; the cashier at the bookstore does n't do any testing . It 's perfectly possible , in fact , that a person who buys one of these books  | is a crumb-bum . Or maybe he 's just a perfectly O.K. person who 's a little thick in the waist and has big feet . But the book is so convincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him Harvey  --  sails along for months , absolutely stinky with self-esteem . He has even begun to feel a little sorry for people who have normal-sized feet and are therefore much more vulnerable to being toppled in a high wind . At the same time , though , he is constantly being bombarded with suggestions that he is not only not the best person in the whole wide world but a walking disaster area . Every time he turns on the television he is reminded that he is overweight and afflicted with a flaking scalp and occasionally irregular and ignorant of the most rudimentary notions of personal investment strategy . When he goes to the bookstore to browse for new books telling him how terrific he is , he notices books with titles like Get That Waistline Down and How to Take Inches Off Those Feet . And his morale is n't helped by the fact that anytime columnists want to indicate that someone might have low self-esteem they name him Harvey . So Harvey is on kind of a roller coaster . One day he 's on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble getting his pants buttoned over that waist of his , and the next day he feels the self-esteem drain out of him like crankcase oil that needed changing a long time ago . When he feels like that , he goes back down to the bookstore and finds something with a title like There 's Absolutely Nobody Better Than You and gets a little booster shot of self-confidence . From reading these books Harvey has learned just how to handle anything that threatens to undermine his belief that there is nobody in the world better than he is . He is quite aware of the possibility that at any time someone might say to him , " Have you ever noticed that you 're  | a little thicker in the waist than a lot of people ? " or even " You know , you 've got a wrinkle or two near the mouth there that could be filled out by fat taken from some part of your body where , not to put too fine a point on this , you would n't really miss it . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been given reason to believe that I 'm the very best person in the whole wide world , although I do n't like to boast . " If the same person goes on to say , " Are those your feet or is there a ski slope around here I did n't notice ? " I larvey knows to say , " I 'm happy to be me . " There may be a time , though , when a confrontation like that shakes Harvey 's confidence . So he goes over to the mall to look for another book with a title like You 're It , Big Guy . But the bookstore is closed . For a moment I larvey is crushed . Then he notices that the toystore next door is still open . He rushes in and says , " Do you have a happy-to-be-me doll ? " They do . Harvey is O.K. again .  | December 2 , 1991 I was n't surprised by the discovery that the question-andanswer sessions President Bush has when he addresses conventions and banquets via closed-circuit television are scripted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here all the time . For instance , some old friends of ours , Hank and Betsy Garland , sometimes give me a list of questions to ask their nineteen-year-old son , Nick . They say it 's the only way they can get any information out of him . I 'm told this is a very common condition among nineteen-year-old boys . Apparently , when the Garlands phone Nick at college , it 's like talking to someone who 's seen too many movies about how prisoners of war are supposed to say nothing beyond their name , rank , and serial number . At the dinner table Betsy Garland might say something to Nick like , " So apparently the Miller boy has decided to go to law school because he figures a law degree will never hurt you , whether you actually practice or not , and he thinks it 's the sort of thing you 're better off doing right away because if not , who knows when you 'll ever feel like going back to school even if you think it 's basically something that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sense to me , does n't it to you ? " p 115 And Nick will say , if he 's in a particularly loquacious flood , " I guess . " The Garlands have reason to believe that when Nick is talking to people who are not related to him he carries on normal conversations . So whenever we all get together while Nick is home for the holidays , Betsy and Hank Garland phone ahead to go over a list of questions they 'd like me to ask Nick , preferably when one of them is standing nearby . The first time the Garlands asked if they could plant some questions with me , I was reluctant . It sounded a little sneaky , and Nick and I , after all , go way back . But Betsy Garland assured me there was nothing at all wrong with it . " We just want to make sure certain topics are covered , " she said . That 's pretty much what the White House said , after a microphone that the president did n't know was open recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schools International convention in Anaheim , California , had n't asked their spontaneous questions in the assigned order . If the White House did n't plant the questions , somebody who had just lost his job might ask the president about why the economy is so rotten instead of asking about why the liberals are so intent on imposing quotas on the American people and ( next question , Mr. President : please turn the page ) coddling vicious criminals . One difference between the White House and our crowd , in addition to the fact that we make do without closed-circuit television , is that we script only the question half of the exchange . I have no idea what Nick is going to answer , and his parents , of course , know a lot less than I do . In that way , it 's more like the Reagan White House  --  full of surprises .  | For instance , when we were at the Garlands ' recently , I was under instructions to find out whether Nick has a serious girlfriend . I was encouraged to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nick , could it be said that there 's a sweetie-pie in the picture ? " or " Tell me : are wedding bells breaking up that old gang of mine ? " As Nick and I chatted near the buffet table , the Garlands drifted closer ; Hank , as a cover , poured Betsy some more cider . I asked the question in a rather roundabout way , and as Nick answered , I noticed that his father had become so engrossed that he kept pouring the cider long after Betsy 's glass was full . Just as Betsy became aware of a stream of cider on her foot , Nick said it would be hard to tell how serious this relationship was until he and the young woman in question traveled in Europe for a while that summer , and Hank  --  shouting , " What Europe ? Who said anything about Europe ? " ? dropped the cider bottle into the turkey gravy . Both Hank and Betsy seemed quite upset as the three of us worked to clean up the mess . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them feel better . " This sort of thing happens at the White House all the time . "  | January 27 , 1992 Once my wife had informed me that a parking ticket in Tokyo could cost $1,400 , I felt a lot better . I had just gotten a parking ticket in New York , under circumstances that I found , well , dispiriting , and my wife was trying to cheer me up . " The most expensive ticket in New York is two hundred dollars , " she said . " That 's only one seventh what it is in Tokyo . And your ticket is for fifty dollars , which is only a quarter of the maximum fine . " My wife was very good at fractions when she was in school , and that has permitted her to see the bright side ever since . Seeing the bright side usually involves knowing about a dark side somewhere else , whether fractions are involved or not . The cost of a parking ticket in Tokyo is typical of the facts she has in what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , I found that somebody had taken a whack at the driver 's door of my car with a blunt instrument , for no reason I could imagine . When I told that to my wife , she reminded me that we had read about a contretemps in Kansas City in which the proprietor of a store dealing in kosher specialties flung a jar of gefilte fish through the windshield of a customer 's car . " That could never happen here , " my wife said . She was right . We 're pretty much safe from having  | tradesmen fling jars of gefilte fish in our direction . In the first place , people in New York ordinarily do their shopping on foot rather than in cars . Also , no store dealing in kosher specialties in New York would think of selling gefilte fish in a jar rather than fresh . I was so grateful for the improvement in my mood that I thanked my wife once again for the help she had given me several weeks before , when I injured my thumb attempting to hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately brought to my attention the woman in Key West we read about last fall in an Associated Press item as follows : " KEY WEST , FLA . ( AP ) ? A drowsy asthma sufferer who grabbed the gun under her pillow rather than the inhaler she keeps there was hospitalized with a bullet wound to the face . " According to the Associated Press , the asthma sufferer , an aircraft maintenance worker at the Boca Chica Naval Air Station , was in what she called " kind of transition " between sleep and consciousness when she plugged herself in the jaw under the impression that she was taking a belt from her inhaler . The shot went through the pillow , and she was n't hurt badly . " It 's true that I have never shot myself in the face in my sleep , " I said . Actually , I do n't own a gun . The Second Amendment to the Constitution reads , " A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way I read that , if I keep and bear arms somebody might get the idea that I 'd be a good person to draft into a well-regulated militia .

" You do n't even have asthma , " my wife said . p 119 Also true . Actually , I sleep pretty well , except on Saturday nights . We live in Greenwich Village , which , as I have mentioned before , is where a lot of people from the suburbs go on Saturday nights to test their car alarms . On the Saturday after I got the door of my car fixed , one of the visitors to our neighborhood apparently became irritated ; maybe he returned to his car at the end of the evening to find that his car alarm had n't gone off once , even though several people had obviously walked within ten yards of it . In that state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be parked on the street ? caving in both of the doors on the driver 's side with such force that one of the back wheels was knocked up onto the curb . Somebody got the license plate of the New Jersey driver , but of course the police in New York have better things to do than work out extradition arrangements with New Jersey for people who hit empty cars . The police were not completely inactive . They gave me a ticket for parking a car partly on the sidewalk . That 's the ticket I found , well , dispiriting . But then my wife told me that in Tokyo a ticket could cost $1,400 . I felt a lot better .  | February10 , 1992 According to the New York Times , there is now at least one Manhattan bar in which a customer who wants to spice up his evening can slip into a jumpsuit with Velcro strips on the back , race down a carpeted runway , do a flip off a small trampoline , and see how high he ends up stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke . At least , I 'm not joking ; I could n't vouch for the level of seriousness of the people sticking upside down on the wall . As it happens , I 'm too old for Velcro wall-jumping . That 's O.K. What strikes me immediately about this sport , if that 's what you 'd call it , is that it 's a good thing to be too old for . If you were n't too old for it , you 'd have to think of another excuse . A while back there was a brief fashion for pop psychology that concentrated on six or eight or ten phases of life that everyone was supposed to go through . At the time , I figured that the stages of life could be reduced to two : the stage during which you 're too young to do what you really want to do and the stage during which you 're too old to do what you really want to do .

For a long time I had routinely glanced at the Transit Authority Police Department 's recruiting advertisements in the subway . If you were eighteen to twenty-nine and had a high school diploma and were in good general health , the ads said , you could apply for a position as a Transit Authority patrolman . One day  --  not a birthday ; this was something that sort of snuck up on me  --  I was riding home on the subway when I realized that I was too old to apply . As it happens , I had never had any desire to become a Transit Authority patrolman . Without having given the matter much thought , I knew I 'd find it a trial walking around with all that stuff hanging off my belt . Still , as I told my wife when I got home , even if you do n't happen to want to go the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't worry about it , " my wife said . " In a couple of years you 're going to be old enough to be president . " As it happens , I did n't want to be president any more than I wanted to be a Transit Authority patrolman . I 've admitted before that I once had a brief yearning for the presidency after I read that the president can see any movie he wants to see right in the basement of the White House , but the yearning evaporated when I read about how hard the president was working on the budget he had to submit to Congress . Any job that considers a budget a top priority , I figured , is not a job for me . These days , of course , VCRs have made it possible for just about anyone to see any movie he wants to see right in his own living room . That may well be why Mario Cuomo decided not to run : he 's known as a real homebody , and these days the movies at his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House .  | But what my wife said that time about the presidency sort of disturbed me . The other way of looking at the situation she had described was this : I was in that awkward period that you go through when you 're too old to become a Transit Authority patrolman and too young to be president  --  a sort of early-thirties no-man's-land . That period can be pretty rough on a person . Maybe that 's why a lot of people in their early thirties do weird things  --  of which trying to stick to Velcro walls upside down is just one I might mention . My relief at not being upside down on a Velcro wall myself made me realize that I 've passed into a third stage of life , one that I was n't aware of when I divided life neatly in two : I 'm in the stage where you find a lot of things you 're grateful for being too old to do . There 's a lot to be said for this stage . I 've started to make a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already on the list . I think it will give me great pleasure someday to add the presidency .  | February 17 , 1992 I was not among those who decided that President Bush 's State of the Union speech failed to live up to its billing as the " defining moment " of his presidency . What could define the Bush Administration better than a speech that nobody could remember anything about two weeks later ? I had previously refused , on similar grounds , to join the general ridicule of the president 's trip to Japan  --  the one that had originally been scheduled as an inspection tour of the New World Order and was transformed under domestic political pressure to a search for " jobs , jobs , jobs " ? as a boondoggle that had no real connection with the problems of American industry . The White House 's transformation of the tour was , I pointed out , a perfect statement of what ails American industry : instead of retooling , they simply repackaged . When it comes to what might be called the presi-dent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you might say that I have been one of his most consistent defenders . Now some of my brethren in the press are saying that one of the president 's problems is that he does n't have any speechwriters who can turn out memorable phrases . Again I have to advise the president to ignore this sort of criticism . When a man has nothing to say , the worst thing he can do is to say it memorably .  | Remember when Dan Quayle , apparently unable to think of an appropriate platitude for the occasion , tried to borrow the motto of the United Negro College Fund ( " A mind is a terrible thing to waste " ) and said , " What a waste it is to lose one 's mind , or not to have a mind as being very wasteful . How true that is . " He would have been a lot better off just mumbling something about how happy he was to be there . Apparently , the people in the White House who do n't understand these things panicked just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noonan , who was declared the genius of Washington speechwriters during the 1988 campaign for writing  --  or , to be absolutely specific , picking up  --  the phrase " Read my lips " as a way for George Bush to promise that he would absolutely never raise taxes . Washington speechwriters become famous these days for utilizing catchlines that have been lying around in the public vocabulary , like dandruff . The second most famous line that emerged from the presidential campaigns of the eighties ? " Where 's the beef ? " ? was lifted from a television commercial . Reagan got both of his best-known lines ? " Make my day " and " Win one for the Gipper " ? from movies . Fortunately for Bush , Noonan could n't think of any memorable phrases for the State of the Union speech . Maybe she has n't been getting to any movies lately . The White House operatives should consider themselves lucky that Noonan had n't just seen Gone with the Wind on videotape . The president , who has lately been trying to show his sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found himself saying , " Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn . " The real problem with " Read my lips " was not that it was a stale catchline . The real problem was that as p 125 delivered by Bush in that bizarre tough-guy imitation he does , as if he were Fred Astaire playing Emiliano Zapata , it became the best-known line of the campaign . As someone who has been in any number of political campaigns , Bush should know that all politicians make promises that they may or may not be able to keep once they get into office and that the last thing a candidate wants to do is tattoo the promise on the public memory with a particularly memorable phrase . Memorable phrases are fine for abstract principles that are not subject to change in the face of political tactics or the quarterly GNP figures ( " Ask not what your country can do for you , ask what you can do for your country " ) . Bush should have learned that lesson in Iowa in 1980 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he charged that Reagan was talking " voodoo economics " and then found himself defending those economics in return for a spot on the ticket . Now a dozen years of voodoo economics have helped put us all in the soup , but is there a memorable phrase that links our problems with Ronald Reagan ? Of course not . That old body did n't spend all those years on the Warner Brothers lot without learning to avoid uttering the punchline of a joke that could turn sour . It 's George Bush who is associated with the economics of voodoo and broken promises . Best be quiet now .  | March 2 , 1992 In Orlando , my cousin John and I had dinner at a place that features a medieval jousting tournament . Then we stopped to take in some bungee-jumping . I was in town only for the evening , and John wanted to make sure I saw the bright lights . I was pretty impressed . I live in New York , where there 's no restaurant at all that puts on a medieval jousting tournament . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large enough for a jousting tournament would cost considerably more than the Middle Ages did . In defense of the entertainment opportunities in Manhattan , I should say that there are a number of restaurants where you can usually count on seeing some rough stuff before the evening 's over . New York does n't have any bungee-jumping either , although every now and then someone displeased with the way the market went that day will jump off a tall building without bothering to attach himself to a cord of any kind . When John informed me , on the way to dinner , that there were half a dozen knights in the jousting tournament , I got pretty excited . " I do n't suppose you 'd be interested in any side bets , would you , John ? " I said . John shook his head disapprovingly . John is a lawyer , and I figured maybe Florida has a strict law against bet-  | ting on knights of the round table . I guess I 've lived in New York too long . New York is a side-bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall building thinking about jumping without being attached to a cord of any kind , there are a lot of side bets down below . John explained to me that side bets really would n't be appropriate because the jousting is more like a show than a real contest . That close to Disney World , he said , everything is a show . I got the impression that if you were mugged in Orlando , the mugger would take off his mask afterward and give you back your money and just collect a couple of coupons from you , unless it 's part of a singleadmission Urban World attraction . The jousting place was , of course , in a castle , along a double-lane lined with restaurants and motels and T-shirt shops and signs informing you that if you do n't happen to like medieval jousting with your dinner you can eat in a place that has an Arabian Nights horse show instead . In the castle eating hall , which was more like an arena than a dining room , tables were arranged in rows , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horsemen perform . Our waiter  --  who , like everybody else on the staff , wore a costume from a Robin Hood movie ? said we would n't have any silverware because they did n't use that sort of thing in the twelfth century . He called us " my lords " and " my ladies . " We called him Duane . Each of the knights was decked out in a different color , matching the colors on his horse . Our section was backing the blue knight , who looked just a tad wimpy to me . We were encouraged to cheer him on and boo his enemies , particularly the green knight . I got into the spirit of the thing right away . I booed the green knight and called him some awful names until a man next to me reminded me that there were children present . I guess  | I 've lived in New York too long . New York is an awfulname sort of place . When the blue knight rode in front of us , I cheered and threw some infield chatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You the man , man . You the boy , boy . No hitter up there . You the best , you the boy , you the baby . " ) Then I sang the University of Missouri fight song . That made a lot of people frown at me , although one man in the yellow section stood up and yelled , " Go , you Tigers . " Our knight got killed by the green knight . " Do n't worry , it 's just a show , " John said . " If it 's just a show , " I said , " I think they could improve it by having the blue knight , just when the green knight is standing over him , about to run him through , pull an AK-47 out of his cape and put about sixty rounds in the green knight . " I was still thinking about ways to improve the show when we got to the bungee-jumping , which consisted of people being taken in the cherry-picker of a crane 150 feet above a drainage pond and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked John . " No , these are real people , " John said . " They pay fifty-five dollars for a jump . " " Great , " I said . " How about some side bets ? "  | April 6 , 1992 My friend Jean-Michel , who arrived from Paris for a visit recently , asked if I could provide him with an update on what 's going on in America these days . " Absolutely no problem , J-M , " I said . " Or , as you folks over there would say , Absolument pas de probleme . " As it happens , I speak a little French myself , except , of course , for verbs . In fact , knowing that in French pas means " not , " more or less , permits me to be a lot more sophisticated than those Wayne 's World guys when it comes to what I believe linguists call the dawdling snapper . When JeanMichel walked in , even before he could ask me what 's going on in the United States , I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool necktie you 're wearing today .. . pas . " That sort of puzzled Jean-Michel . So I told him that maybe the Wayne 's World way of talking was difficult for a foreigner to understand . Then I assured him that his English is , of course , absolutely perfect . Then , after a couple of beats , I said , " . . . pas . " Then I started giggling a lot , and Jean-Michel gave me a very stern look . When I had pulled myself together , I told JeanMichel that what American political candidates talk about a lot these days  --  aside from whether or not their opponent is guilty of having thrown spitballs in fourth grade  --  is how the middle class is faring . All politicians  | say they want to improve the lot of the middle class , I told him , which is not bad politics considering the fact that in the United States ninety percent of the population identifies itself as middle class . " Ah , the bourgeoisie , " Jean-Michel said . " Well , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jean-Michel said . " Look it up . " I hate it when Jean-Michel says to look something up , because he 's almost always right . He really does speak perfect English , even though he sounds a lot like Inspector Clouseau . I took out the dictionary  --  the English dictionary  --  and looked up " bourgeoisie . " It said that " bourgeoisie " means the middle class . Once I got used to the idea , I realized that public discourse on this subject could be freshened up a bit if the politicians began referring to the middle class as the bourgeoisie . It 's in the dictionary that way , after all . Think of presidential candidates insisting in their campaign debates that something has to be done to ease the economic pressures now facing the bourgeoisie . Think of a congressional leader leaning into the television camera and saying earnestly , " We have been trying to put together some package that will offer a bourgeois tax cut . " Jean-Michel happened to arrive toward the end of the New York primary campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bill Clinton and Jerry Brown . " Are they both representatives of the bourgeoi-sie ? " he said . " Well , not exactly , " I said . " Clinton is the kid in school from a less than perfect family who will do anything to avoid a blemish on his record Cl may have thrown one spitball , but what I was really doing was carrying on an experiment having to do with wind currents , an experiment that can be seen as a reflection of my p 131 healthy curiosity and my interest in the wonders of the nature around me , and also I did n't really enjoy it very much ' ) , and Brown is the kid who 's shameless because he knows his father can put in the fix ( ' Sure I threw spitballs , but that was the old me ' ) . " " Just as I thought , " Jean-Michel said . " They are both representatives of the bourgeoisie . And how has the president been doing as a campaigner ? " I told Jean-Michel that on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot and speak in little bursts of sentence fragments that sound as if they might be part of some other conversation carried on by two other people somewhere else on a different subject . " I think if he were campaigning in France , he would n't have any trouble at all winning the affection of the vot-ers , " I said , " because he 's very reminiscent of Jerry Lewis . " " Ah , Jerry . . . " Jean-Michel said , smiling just at the thought . The French , of course , revere Jerry Lewis , although there is no indication that they would actually want somebody like that as their president . " That 's right , J-M , " I said . " When I saw clips of Bush campaigning in New Hampshire , I half expected him to end with a pitch for funds to fight the scourge of muscular dystrophy . " " So how do the American people feel about this campaign , then ? " Jean-Michel said . " Well , we think everything 's going to be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | April 13 , 1992 Every new baseball season brings renewed pressure for me to become a Kansas City fan . I 'm used to it by now . When the president throws out the first ball , I know that I 'll be getting a telephone call the morning after the Royals have posted their first victory . " Hey , how about those Royals ! " a baseball fan I know named Gerald will say . " How about them ? " I will say , in a tone of voice that is pretty much the tone of voice I might use if someone said to me , " Hey , how about those new regulations in Title XII of the Farm Price Support Act revisions ? " When the Athletics were in Kansas City , Gerald used to say , " Hey , how about those Athletics ! " " How about them ? " I always said , as if he had drawn my attention to some new statistics on urban mass transit in the European Community . Gerald always responded to that in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City and all , " he 'd say . " I am from Kansas City , " I would say . " But the Athletics are not . They are a Philadelphia team . " Every year I have to explain to Gerald once again that when I was a lad I rooted for the Kansas City Blues of the old American Association , the true Kansas City team . I have to explain to him that your team when you were twelve is your team forever , unless you 're a Communist or something .  | " The Athletics moved to Kansas City from Philadel-phia , " I will remind him again this year when the subject of the Royals comes up . That will cause him to say that he is talking about the Royals , not the Athletics . That will cause me to say that , as a matter of principle ; I have always refused to distinguish between them . That will cause him to say that the Royals actually originated in Kansas City . That will cause me to say , " Not when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a Philadelphia team , " I will repeat . " They were led by Connie Mack . He was the oldest man in the world when I was twelve . He must be positively ancient by now . " " Connie Mack died years ago , " Gerald will say . " I 'm sorry to hear it , " I will say . " A real gentleman , Mr. Mack . " I remind Gerald that six years ago I acknowledged publicly that my devotion to the Kansas City Blues was of such purity that their demise ended my interest in organized baseball . I no longer know which baseball managers are dead and which are alive . I feel the same way about owners . If the Red Sox are not still owned by Tom Yawkey , I do n't want to know about it . Gerald has lived in New York for forty years , but he grew up in Baltimore . He is a loyal fan of the Baltimore Orioles . In the past I have felt obligated to remind him that the Orioles arrived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore cheering for someone else 's team . The Baltimore franchise was moved from St. Louis . The Orioles are actually the old St. Louis Browns , and , from what I 'm told , it sometimes shows in the late innings . " That 's ridiculous , " Gerald said to me . " There 's no law that a person has to root for the team he rooted for when he was twelve . You live in New York now . You could root for the Yankees if you wanted to . " " I would never root for the Yankees , even if I were  | still interested in organized baseball , " I told Gerald . " The Blues were a Yankee farm club , and the Yankees were always calling up our best players just when we got into the stretch of a pennant race . I hate the Yankees . Any Blues fan worth his salt hates the Yankees . " " I do n't know what you mean by any Blues fan , ' " Gerald said . " The Blues have n't played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blues fan there is . " " I consider that a great honor , " I said . " And a re-sponsibility . " This year , Gerald wanted me to go to Baltimore with him to see a game in the new stadium . " It 's a fantastic place , " he said . " You can get hot dogs but you can also get crabcakes . " " I ca n't imagine why a St. Louis team would serve crabcakes , " I told Gerald . " There are n't any crabs in the Mississippi . Actually , the specialty of St. Louis is toasted ravioli . At the least they might serve catfish . Not crab-cakes . " " Why do n't you drop all this silliness and come with me to an Orioles game , " Gerald said . " Maybe one of these days , " I said . " Let me know the next time they have a three-game series with the Blues . "  | May 11 , 1992 Here 's how this country took care of the herpes epidemic : we quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS . We talked about that so much that we more or less forgot about herpes . So it disappeared . I think that 's what they must mean by the phrase " modern medical miracle . " Some years ago I saw mononucleosis taken care of the same way . When I was in college , mononucleosis was the diagnosis of choice for practically any set of symptoms . You could hardly step onto a campus without being diagnosed as having mono . College students today never heard of mononucleosis . Did somebody discover a vaccine ? Did mono change its name ? I do n't think so . I think it just disappeared because we quit talking about it . Remember when you got a nasty little bump and your mother said if you just quit talking about it for a while it would go away ? That 's how we took care of mononucleosis . You say you know someone who has herpes ? Oh , well , sure . That 's perfectly possible . When I say we took care of it , I do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope your friend does n't expect any sympathy , because we do n't talk about it anymore . It 's all over . We took care of it . We 've done that with any number of problems . Re-  | member when vicious pit bulls were a big problem in this country ? That was a scary time . When you walked down some ostensibly peaceful street in a nice residential neighborhood , you were always imagining a low growl off in the bushes . But then we took care of vicious pit bulls the same way we took care of herpes . We quit talking about them . That was that for vicious pit bulls . I guess we showed them . You say you know someone who got bit by a vicious pit bull just a few days ago ? Well , sure . It happens . But let 's not make a big deal out of it . It 's over . President Reagan was a master at taking care of problems by not talking about them . Remember when the chaos in Lebanon was such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peace ? Then a couple of hundred marines got killed in that barracks bombing and we pulled out and Reagan simply quit talking about Lebanon ? " What barracks bombing ? " you say . " Which marines ? Which Lebanon ? " See what I mean ? He took care of that one . George Bush tried to do the same thing with the problem of racism and the conditions existing in the inner cities . You may have wondered why the Reagan-Bush people did n't establish a policy of its own if , as Marlin Fitzwater claimed , the Great Society programs they found when they came to power were just the sort of things that cause riots ( " If the government puts one more Head Start program in this neighborhood , I 'm going to trash the supermarket " ) . The answer is that they did put in a policy of their own : the policy was to not talk about it . It was n't exactly what Daniel Patrick Moynihan once called " benign neglect . " It was more like malicious neglect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was on  --  say , by insisting , long  | after even business leaders were satisfied with last year 's civil rights bill , that he would n't sign it because it was a " quota bill " that would result in " reverse discrimination . " In fact , I suspect that if you did a computer search on what George Bush has said on the issue of race in America during his term of office , you 'd find that he has talked more about the evil of quotas than about any other subject . In other words , despite what places like southcentral Los Angeles were like even before the riots , the most consistent message the president of the United States has delivered on the question of race in the past three years is that we 're in danger of giving black people too many breaks . But that was n't his policy . His policy was to not talk about it . The only one of Bush 's cabinet secretaries who ever mentioned the problems of the inner city was Jack Kemp , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to documents leaked to the New York Times , one of the arguments used by White House aides for rejecting Kemp 's notion that Bush should lead an antipoverty effort was that it could give poverty " greater visibility . " Now that the riots in Los Angeles have made all of this a leading subject of discussion , the president saves a place for Kemp on Air Force One and invites him around for photo opportunities and talks about how dandy his ideas are . Bush is discovering that your mother was n't always right . Sometimes , if you do n't talk about it , it wo n't go away after all .  | June 1 , 1992 When I read that the young Ross Perot 's stated reason for wanting a hardship discharge before he had fulfilled his naval obligation was that sailors were always " taking God 's name in vain " and behaving promiscuously on shore leave , I had to wonder whether he knew a lot less about the Navy when he was in high school than I did . While I was growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of states and a few years from Perot  --  we were aware that sailors did not always behave absolutely respectably , particularly in foreign ports . That was part of the draw . In fact , if I had been asked to explain the traditional appeal of the Navy for the sons of the Midwest in two words , I believe those two words would have been " shore leave . " We were desperately envious of shore leave . We did n't even have any shore . We also liked the idea of all that cussing . These days , of course , it 's common to hear grannies talk dirty . But when Ross and I were growing up , talking dirty in front of grownups was certainly frowned on  --  or maybe swatted at would be a better way to put it  --  and talking dirty in front of girls was n't done much either . The Navy , we thought , offered a young man from the Midwest the opportunity to cuss all he wanted . Lest you think the notion of sailors regularly taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our  | fevered teenage imaginations , I should point out that our parents reinforced this view by occasionally referring to some respectable-looking older citizen as having the capacity to " swear like a sailor . " All of which makes it surprising that Ross Perot applied to the Naval Academy under the impression that he could get through there and through the active duty the Navy expected in return for his free education without hearing any strong language . I can only assume that the phrase " swears like a sailor " was n't heard much in Texarkana , Texas , during the time he was growing up there . It may be that Kansas City was a more worldly place than Texarkana ; if so , though , how do you explain the fact that at Hale H. Cook grade school in Kansas City I went through the entire Second World War under the impression that Japanese people had yellow blood ? In Texarkana , young Ross may not have had enough contact with sailors to know whether they cussed or not . In the movies of those days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have never said anything stronger than " Dang-nap it . " Even so , you 'd think that someone in his senior high school class  --  some worldly fellow who had transferred in from , say , Amarillo  --  could have predicted the " moral emptiness " of Navy life that Ross described with such shock in the letter his father forwarded to the congressman who had appointed Ross to Annapolis and to both Texas senators . But it 's possible that as a high school student Perot simply brushed aside the warning . " Ross , " I can imagine the new boy in town saying , " I know you have your heart set on going to Annapolis , but I have to warn you that serving in the Navy could mean being in close proximity to people who take the name of the Lord in vain on a fairly regular basis . " " There 's not one iota of truth in that , " young Ross  | says , having already acquired some of the **26;0;TOOLONG bluster that the American voters will one day love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll buy milkshakes for the entire class . " The boy from Amarillo , still determined to warn Ross of what might lie ahead , says that , from what he is given to understand , sailors on shore leave sometimes engage in acts with complete strangers that the Lord meant only married people to do with each other , and then only if they promise not to talk about it . " Stuff and nonsense , " young Ross says . " Not true . And I have a dozen members of the senior class who are willing to swear that it 's not true . I do n't have to sit here and listen to some slick Amarillo guy in alligator shoes try to trip me up . " The new boy from Amarillo starts to say he is , in fact , wearing penny-loafers , but young Ross is launched on a lecture . " If there is swearing in the Navy , the way I 'll take care of it wo n't be pretty , but you 'll never hear any of it again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross , " the boy from Amarillo finally says . " Have it your way . "  | June 15 , 1992 I guess now you 'll be wanting to know if I consider myself part of the " cultural elite " that Dan Quayle has been talking so much about . My Aunt Rosie certainly hopes that I am . Our family has never been part of any elite before , and she sees this as our big opportunity . " I say go for it , " Aunt Rosie told me in a phone call from Kansas City . " If they 're giving out some sort of cultural-elite certificate that 's suitable for framing , try to get an extra one . " " But Aunt Rosie , " I said . " Surely you do n't think of me as a moral cynic who sneers at our country 's enduring basic values and mocks patriotism and thinks that a family is just a collection of unrelated bozos with kinky habits who happen to live under the same leaky roof . " " You were real smart-alecky as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to count for something . " Then she hung up . Until Aunt Rosie 's call , it really had n't occurred to me that what Quayle kept describing as a cultural elite ? a bunch of flat-out sophisticates  --  might include me . For one thing , I was brought up not to put on airs . Also , I 've always thought of the elite as the sort of people who play golf at snooty country clubs and have so much influence that they can get even their dumbest kid into college .  | Nobody in our family has ever belonged to anything snootier than one of those video stores that give you two films for the price of one on Wednesday night if you take out a lifetime membership . And when my cousin Elliot got turned down by one of those schools that teach you to be a truck driver in your spare time , nobody in our family had the clout to get him in  --  even though you 'd think a school that was being investigated by both the Better Business Bureau and the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure . Also  --  although this may sound like a technicality ? Quayle said that the cultural elite hangs out in " newsrooms , sitcom studios and faculty lounges , " and I work mostly at home . The kids are out of the house now , and my wife is often away at work ; on most days , even if I did decide to sneer at our country 's enduring basic moral values , nobody would notice anyway , except maybe the UPS deliveryman or the guy who comes to read the gas meter . It did occur to me , though , that I might know some of the people Quayle was talking about . For instance , I have a cousin who 's a professor  --  he 's quite a bit brighter than Elliot ; I suspect he could teach himself to drive a truck  --  but when I asked him whether he was part of the cultural elite that hangs around the faculty lounge , he said he had always avoided the faculty lounge . " There are people lurking there just waiting to put you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've got some sort of allergy so that when I see a bottle of sherry it makes me long for a cold beer . " I also have a friend named Mo , who 's spent a lot of time in newsrooms . Although Mo 's an editor now , I had n't thought of him as particularly elite . I 've never seen him with the knot of his tie pulled all the way up ;  | Iwould n't be surprised to hear that when he needs shirts he buys seconds that are missing the collar button . Still , I figured it would n't hurt to try him out , so the Saturday after I 'd heard from Aunt Rosie I gave him a call . " Say , Mo , " I said . " You want to go down to Lou 's Tap and mock family values for a while ? " " I swore to Eleanor that I would n't leave the house today until I made some headway cleaning out this base-ment , " Mo said . " Then I promised Jenny I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got her for her birthday , and Tim and I have to finish the birdhouse we 've been building together , and then I have to get dressed and get to the plane if I 'm not going to miss my high school reunion in Cedar Rapids . How about next Sat-urday ? " I called Aunt Rosie back and told her that , as far as I could tell , I did n't even know anyone in the cultural elite . " I 'm not surprised , " she said . " I always told your mother that you 'd never amount to anything . " Then she hung up .  | June 29 , 1992 Yes , of course I 've been thinking about the marriage of Valerie Jane Silverman and Michael Thomas Flaherty ? two fine-looking and richly accomplished graduates of Harvard , class of 1987 ? who tied the knot some weeks ago and adopted as a common family name Flaherman . I wo n't say that I 've been thinking about nothing else . We 've had half a dozen wars going on , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Ross Perot will get so mad at people who accuse him of being quick to investigate enemies that he 'll sic a bunch of private eyes on the lot of them , and Bill Clinton has been trying to hack away with the sharp end of a saxophone , which does n't really have a sharp end , at whatever strings seemed to tie him to Jesse Jackson . But I 've been thinking about it . I did not need all of those telephone calls asking if I had , by chance , missed the Flahermans ' wedding announcement in the Sunday New York Times . I stated years ago that the wedding announcements have always been the first news I turn to on Sunday in the Times . It has been my custom to do some careful analysis of the family background of each bride and groom , and then to try to envision the tension at the wedding reception . The names going into the marriage are , of course , helpful to that sort of vision , as is the assumption that  | every human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtly bi-ethnic merger such as the marriage of Valerie Silverman to Michael Flaherty , I would ordinarily have wondered whether Mike Flaherty 's dingbat fourth Cousin , who has been assuring all of the Silvermans that some of his best friends are Jewish , will actually fall into conversation toward the end of the evening with an equally boorish cousin of Valerie Silverman 's who has been poking every Flaherty he meets in the ribs and saying , " I guess you 've heard the one about Murphy , ( ) ' Leary , and the two priests . " In recent years , though , the name taken after the wedding has added to my concerns . Whether or not the bride is going to retain her last name has become an important element in the announcement  --  you have to wonder whether the Nancy Jones who announces that she will be keeping her surname after marrying a young man named Cholmondley Rhoenheusch is a committed feminist or a weak speller  --  and I 've been wondering lately whether a wedding someday between , say , the son of Madonna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple who had to start married life with no last name at all . The Flaherman nuptials were particularly interesting to me because of the possibility that their approach to merging names as well as lives was the outgrowth of a warning I issued fifteen years ago about the danger of liberated young couples combining surnames by connecting them with hyphens . At the time , I pointed out that if Penelope Shaughnessy married Nathaniel Underthaler while her best friend , Jennifer Morgenwasser , married Jeremiah Christianson , and then the children of those two unions , Jedediah Shaughnessy-Underthaler and Abigail **25;28;TOOLONG , themselves got married  --  a prospect that the two old friends , Penelope  | Shaughnessy-Underthaler and Jennifer MorgenwasserChristianson , so devoutly wished that they were nearly afraid to mention it at the luncheons they continued to have over the years , even though such luncheons irritated any number of restaurant proprietors who tried to jam one of those double-barreled names into the tiny space allotted in the reservation book  --  these offspring would end up as a couple named Jedediah and Abigail **49;55;TOOLONG . Which means that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headline unless it was a headline announcing , say , World War III . I think what the Flahermans  --  and , presumably , others by now  --  have done is a resourceful solution to the problem of how modern women can retain their names without creating monikers that make the signature run off the line every single time . One of the people I talked to about this situation ? those of us who are devoted to the wedding section of the Times are likely to be sharing impressions of this or that announcement late on a Sunday morning , when people in other households are discussing the trouble in the Balkans or thinking about turning to the breakfast dishes  --  said that Flaherman struck him as a less euphonious name than , for instance , Silverty , but I consider that a quibble . So congratulations to the Flahermans . And what if they have a son who wins the hand of Daphne **49;106;TOOLONG ? We 'll deal with that problem when we get to it .  | July 20 , 1992 First I read in Newsweek that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 94 against admitting women to membership . Then I read in the Toronto Globe and Mail that the Furness Rugby Union Club , in Barrow , England , was trying to raise money by having female fans bid on the opportunity to take a shower with the team . As the panel moderator often says , each of us must deal with these difficult issues in our own way . Americans tend to visualize a London men 's club as a bunch of old Blimps who doze away the afternoon in leather chairs , waking up occasionally to curse their gout or the Socialists . But Newsweek describes the Garrick as a " preserve of actors , lawyers , judges and journalists " ? which might make you think that it 's less stuffy than some of the other clubs , since actors and journalists are prominent among the occupational groups that prudent landlords in any country try not to rent to . When it comes to admitting women , I suppose you could say that the Garrick is indeed less stuffy than some of the other clubs : the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the issue . We 're free to continue thinking of the members of those clubs as jowly old coots who are likely to begin their most intimate endearments to their wives with a phrase like " Hilda , old thing .. "  | Before I go any further in presenting mitigating evidence about the Garrick Club , I should probably disclose that I actually know two of its members  --  startling as that may be to those who assumed that I would n't know anyone who belonged to anything more august than an outlaw motorcycle club . One of the people I know is a journalist I 'll call Trevor , and the other one is a law professor I 'll call Cedric . I have given them those names to make them sound more like authentic club men . Trevor was the first of them to join the Garrick . At the time I made an agreement with him : I promised not to make fun of him for belonging to such an institution if he promised never to take me to dinner there . I have always assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialize in gray , room-temperature meat , accompanied by vegetables that he began cooking shortly after wartime rationing was lifted , and I had no intention of putting that assumption to the test . Trevor , whose credentials as a gentleman had been confirmed by an official vote of the admissions committee , stuck to his part of the bargain , and I , never having been so certified , did not . Still , I ca n't think of Trevor and Cedric as people who would cast votes in favor of discriminating against women ; I certainly have never heard either one of them address his wife as " old thing . " In the interest of full disclosure , I should also say that I am not personally acquainted with any members of the Furness Rugby Union Club . Like many Americans , I 've had difficulty understanding the rules of rugby . To me , a rugby scrum has always looked remarkably like what sometimes goes on in the parking lot after a dance at which the sponsors were lax about checking for bottles at the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement of that sort is to try to take your leave before the police show up . It is tempting , of course , to gather from news of the rugby club 's fund-raising device that its members have a somewhat more flexible view of the opposite sex than do members of the Garrick Club , but that may not be true . There is nothing in the news item indicating that the female fan who wins an opportunity to shower with the team will be offered membership in the club . In other words , the Garrick Club could offer a similar opportunity and still vote 362 to 94 not to admit women . I should say right here that even though Trevor and Cedric have many admirable qualities , I ca n't imagine that an opportunity to shower with them would result in frenzied bidding . And how did Trevor and Cedric vote ? I have n't heard . I like to think , of course , that they were on the side that wanted to admit women . I 'd like to think that , as a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became obvious that a majority of the members felt otherwise . Any day now , I expect to get a letter from Trevor saying , " Cedric and I did the only honorable thing . We resigned . We have both applied for membership in the Furness Rugby Union Club . "  | August 3 , 1992 In the patch of the Maritimes that I retreat to every summer to lick my wounds , there are n't usually many new developments to report , unless the old-timer in town who hands out a lot of folksy but totally ineffectual advice has come up with yet another deeply flawed method for keeping the raccoons out of your garbage . This year , though , we heard something exciting right off the bat . It came out during dinner with a couple I 'll call Ralph and Letitia Jackson , who make the long drive up to our part of the woods annually from the Deep South in order to escape summer heat so relentless that a dip in the local pond could melt the plaster on your bunions . At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with just restrooms and a couple of pay phones  --  Letitia had driven away under the assumption that Ralph was asleep in the back of the van , and that assumption had proven to be highly unfounded . Ralph , poor fellow , was in the men 's . What excited me about the story was that it was a palpably authentic example of the sort of experience you hear now and then in the sort of modern folktales that usually carry the sniff of the apocryphal and the embellished ( " This guy at work knows someone who 's supposed to be a cousin of the people this actually happened to " ) . The Jacksons are real people . Also , they are , unlike the  | old-timer , thoroughly reliable citizens . In other words , I was in the unusual position of hearing the folktale on first telling . By the time I heard the story , a couple of weeks after Ralph had emerged to find himself alone early one morning at a place in Tennessee where he had n't really intended to linger , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of us at the dinner table could n't help wondering whether it had something in common with , say , Army experiences , which tend to seem more humorous in the recollection than they were at the time . The details were undisputed . Just before the rest stop , Letitia had taken over the wheel , with Ralph trying to sleep in the back of the van . The car was gassed up , and Letitia was determined to drive all the way from the rest stop to the Virginia state line . She had barreled down the interstate toward that goal for forty-five minutes when the telephone rang . Telephone ? That 's right . There was a brand-new car phone in the van . Standing at the rest stop , trying to figure out a way to rein Letitia in before she hit the New Jersey Turnpike , Ralph had figured that he might be able to raise her on the car phone . This was after he called the highway patrol , which did n't seem terribly interested in offering any help ; they probably figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to be a cousin of the people it had happened to . It turned out to be complicated to catch the van in the right car-phone zone , and when the phone finally did start to ring , Letitia , who was somewhat rattled at being phoned on the interstate in the middle of Tennessee , did n't know how to get it out of the cradle . So she yelled back to Ralph to wake up and get the telephone . No Ralph .  | That surprised her some , but she quickly figured out what had happened , and , still unable to free the car phone from its cradle , she stopped at the next rest area . Walking into the fast-food emporium there , she said to the woman behind the cash register , " I think I just did the dumbest thing I 've done all day . I left my husband at a rest stop forty-five minutes back . " " The only question left , honey , " the woman said , " is whether or not you 're going to bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the funniest part of the entire experience . I assume Ralph had a different view of it , since his response to that part of the story was to mutter , " I guess Thelma and Louise has come to the drive-ins . " Letitia did go back , of course . Ralph told me that he does n't remember what he said when she arrived . That surprised me . He was n't on the telephone the entire time , after all ; he had plenty of time to polish a line . I like to picture him leaning up against the phone booth ( about the only thing he had to lean up against ) with a toothpick in his mouth , saying , " Forget something , lady ? " It may get to that yet . After all , this is only the second telling .  | August lo , 1992 My old Army buddy Charlie  --  who this time of year is hard to separate from his chain saw  --  phoned recently in a dither over the news that the Environmental Protection Agency is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mowers and other off-road gas-powered machinery . " The federals will never take my chain saw away from me , " Charlie said . " I 'll run off and hide in the forest and live off berries . " " You ca n't hide in the forest , " I reminded Charlie . " You 've cut down the forest with your chain saw . " This is only a slight exaggeration . Charlie happens to own an acre or two of thick woods behind his house ? a tangled and rocky patch that nobody had ever found any particular use for  --  and some years ago , just after he got his chain saw , he decided it would be valuable to have some trails through it . " My plan is to cut a trail from the back yard all the way to the northeast corner of the woods , " Charlie told his wife . " Why would anybody want to go to the northeast corner of the woods ? " his wife asked . " There 's nothing there . It looks exactly like all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case , " Charlie said . The trail to the northeast corner worked out so well that Charlie cut a trail to the northwest corner . Then he decided that those two trails would be much more effec-  | tive if they were linked . After that , one thing just led to another until the woods began to resemble one of those sad pictures you see of a badly bombed city where the odd building is somehow left standing above the rubble every few blocks . You 're probably assuming that my attitude toward this maniacal tree-toppling was concern for the trees or concern for Charlie 's stability . Wrong . My principal response was quiet envy . I had some woods that needed trails myself . And my wife had forbidden me to have a chain saw . Forbidden ? Yes , I realize it 's an old-fashioned concept . Maybe it 's the wrong word . Somehow , though , when the government was formed at our house many years ago , my wife acquired among her portfolios Minister of Safety , and she has always had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " I forbid you to operate a chain saw , " just as she did n't have to say , in her role as Minister of Attire , " I forbid you to wear that ratty old jacket . " ( She could just study me , as I came down the stairs , and say , " Is that the jacket you 're planning to wear ? " ) So I bided my time . I brought up the subject occasionally . I 'd mention casually at dinner that a 128-pound accountant we know who 's been held back in his firm because the partners find him " too thorough " had just bought a chain saw . I 'd muse on the possibility that not being allowed to have a BB gun as a boy , even though all the boys on the block had them , had scarred me deeply  --  causing , perhaps , a lifetime weakness for beer and sausages . Finally , after about twenty years , she said , " I do n't know why you keep telling me these things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain saw . " So I got a chain saw . I had laboriously cut some trails already with non-hydrocarbon-spewing instruments , such  | as a hatchet . With my new chain saw , I figured , I 'd be able to triple my trails within a few weeks . But I had figured without taking into account a joint operation of the Ministry of Safety and the Ministry of Attire . " Are those the clothes you 're planning to wear ? " my wife asked as I stood in the door holding my new chain saw . I had forgotten the need for safety clothing . So I got a helmet with a mask that pulls over the face and ear protectors that snap down on the side . I got pants that seem to have every rock I 've ever taken out of the garden sewn into them . I got gloves made of steel mesh . I got steel-lined boots that I can lift off the ground if I pause for a beat or two between steps . I looked like the Pillsbury Doughboy . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing all that equipment and carrying a chain saw , I was too exhausted to do any sawing . Sooner or later I went back to my hatchet . " A man 's got a right to a chain saw , " Charlie was saying . " I think it 's in the Constitution . " " You can hide in our woods , Charlie , " I said . " I 've hardly made a dent in them . "  | August 17 , 1992 I would n't want to be described as the sort of traveler who sits in the motel room reading the local telephone directory . Still , when I 'm in a new place , I do tend to leaf through the Yellow Pages in an idle moment , on the off chance that I might find listings like Metaphysicians or Cat Walkers or Husbands  --  Removal . While I was in the Puget Sound area recently , I happened to glance through the Yellow Pages in MacGregor 's Greater Whidbey Island 1992-93 Directory , and I was surprised at the amount of non-directory reading material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Household  --  Dealers and Garden &; Lawn Equipment &; Supplies were some inspirational passages ( " Thomas Edison 's Tribute to His Mother " ) and some articles of the sort you might read as newspaper fillers ( " Physical Science Grads Diminishing " ) and , most of all , helpful advice  --  everything from " Seven Steps to Better Mileage in Your Car " to " The Prostate : A Common Problem . " I liked the idea that a directory user who might be disappointed by finding no listing for , say , Translators ? Farsi could at least feel that the time spent searching had been well spent , since useful knowledge was picked up on how to dispose of hazardous household wastes or how  | to be a shrewd homebuyer ( " Jump in the center of all rooms to see if the floors are springy " ) . My reservations about this approach to business listings began with an item in the directory called " How to Reduce Air Crash Risk . " It said , among other things , " Simple tips include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin during a cabin fire . " As it happens , I had been strapping myself into airplane seats for years without giving a thought to whether my clothes were particularly meltable , and I was n't keen to add that to my checklist of items to worry about . For that matter , once I started thinking about worries I 'd just as soon not be aware of , I realized that I had never jumped in the center of all the rooms of our house to make sure the floors were n't springy . In this mood , I came across an article , right next to the listing for Humane Societies , that advised pet owners who have lost pets about how to protect themselves from " false finders . " According to the article , " Certain sick crank-callers prey on distraught pet owners who advertise in the Lost Pet section of their newspapers . " Pet owners are cautioned against telling a caller what a lost pet is named or what it looks like . " Even if your pet is a solid color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does the dog have any spots ? " This was the first I had ever heard of " false finders . " I was n't concerned about being preyed upon by these sick cranks ; I do n't happen to own a pet . What worried me , for the first time , was that I might find a dog , reply to a lost-dog advertisement like a decent citizen , and be mistaken for a false finder : " Mr. Smith ? " I say after dialing the number listed in the paper . " I have found what I believe to be your missing wheaten terrier . Does his name happen to be Nigel ?  | I ask because he 's wearing a tag that says N I G E L , he answers to that name , and when I say Nigel , jump , ' he leaps over my credenza . " " I 'd rather not say , " Smith replies . " Nigel is not a name to be ashamed of , " I say . " People name dogs odd names . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Full Frontal Nudity  --  Frontal for short . " " What does this dog look like ? " Smith asks . " Totally gray , " I say . " Completely gray coat . No markings . Gray tail . Gray eyes . Gray paws . I would call him a study in grayness . " " Does he have any spots ? " Smith asks . " Not unless they are gray spots that happen to be the same color as the rest of him , " I say . " He 's really quite gray , your Nigel . " " I have n't admitted that his name is Nigel , " Smith says . " Why do n't you see if he answers to Fred . ' " " Why should he answer to Fred ' ? " I say . " His name is Nigel . " Nigel , meanwhile , is getting so excited at the constant mention of his name that he is jumping back and forth over the credenza , like a gray Ping-Pong ball . " Fred may have spots , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shout . " He does n't have spots . His name is not Fred . " By this time I am so irritated that I am jumping up and down in place as Nigel jumps back and forth . For the first time I notice that the floorboards feel a little springy .  | November 23 , 1992 During a recent breakfast at the house of some friends in London , I was forced to ask my host , straight out , what " gormless " meant . I had noticed that one of the English papers , in its American coverage , had described MTV as " the gormless pop video channel . " In England I 'm constantly asking what something means . As a result , reading the English papers with me over breakfast is not thought of as a stress-free way of starting the day . Considerate American guests are expected to ask one or two initial questions at breakfast ? a question , say , about whether there is some nutritional purpose behind the English custom of drying out the toast thoroughly in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a decent peace . In my defense , I should say that I had tried to puzzle out " gormless " for myself by tossing the root word around in a couple of forms : " I 'm impressed that MTV no longer falls back on any cheap gorming . . . . The man is completely lacking in common gorm . " I do often manage to figure out a piece of English slang without assistance . The day before , it had been obvious what one paper meant by its reference to someone as the new supremo of programming at ITV , an English television channel that is considered at least marginally less gormless than MTV . ( I can pass on that information  | with some confidence because my host had informed me that " gormless " means lacking discernment or thought ? what I believe my daughters would call ditz-brained . ) A supremo is what our newspapers would refer to as a boss or a czar or , if the headline writer is in a playful mood , a big enchilada . Over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usages that Americans have traditionally employed to make facile characterizations of the mother country . ( " Where else would cops be courteous enough to refer to a lineup as an identity parade and antique dealers be quaint enough to categorize old pitchforks as farming bygones and restaurant proprietors be dowdy enough to include on menus a vegetable dish known as mushy peas ? " ) I do like to keep up with the new slang , though , and on my recent trip I came to realize that I 'm falling behind . Some Britishers might be falling behind themselves . My host seemed to lose a bit of confidence when I looked up from the paper one morning and asked him to define " raver . " He thought of a raver as a loud partygoer , although he was reminded by his slang dictionary that the word has also been used to mean a woman who is not known to be overly inhibited ( " She 's a right little raver " ) . When I asked the same question of my host 's daughter , she left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain gormlessness . Analyzing ravers as a distinct subculture , she explained that they often go around in baggy black trousers and sometimes carry whistles and often take the drug Ecstasy during raves and dance to music she does n't happen to care for ( " It does my head in " ) . Her father had at least been on the right track . I would call him slightly out-of-date rather than ditzbrained . On the other hand , neither he nor anyone else p 161 in the family could identify a word I ran across in an Independent piece on Sir Nicholas Fairbairn , a Scottish member of Parliament who remarked that some of the women who oppose him in the House are simply " cagmags , scrub heaps , old tattles . " It was easy to get the drift of " scrub heap " : nobody wants to be called a heap of anything . I 'm familiar with old tattles ; I have even been tattled on by a few of them . But cagmag ? I figured it was a term like " sitcom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might have ( lone everybody a favor by remaining in their own words . I asked an assortment of Britishers , to no avail . I consulted the dictionary of slang , but it was silent on the subject of cagmag . As a last resort I tried the Oxford English Dictionary , which informed me that a cagmag is a tough old goose  --  and has been , at least in parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire , since the late eighteenth century . As far as I could gather , the opponents of Margaret Thatcher had gone through her entire reign without that information on hand . While I had the OED out , I looked up " gormless , " just on a hunch . It was there , along with a citation dating it to 1746 . It appears in Wuthering Heights . I found all that discouraging . I had been having difficulty enough keeping up with fresh English slang . Now it turns out that they 're adding words from both ends .  | November 30 , 1992 Everyone seemed pleased by Prime Minister John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay taxes . Personally , I ca n't wait to see whether that trip Fergie took to the South of France was deductible . I think you could make a pretty good argument to the tax boys that Fergie 's little romp , as the tabloids tend to call it , was a legitimate business expense . I say that on the theory that you could make a pretty good argument to the tax boys that virtually everything the royals do is a legitimate business expense . They are , after all , among the very few people on earth who are actually paid for existing . You could argue that when they get up in the morning and brush their teeth , they 're doing their jobs . Some of their expenses  --  Prince Philip 's tailor bills , for instance  --  are so patently connected with what 's expected of the Windsors that they 're obviously deductible even under the narrowest definition of royal duties . A personal trainer for the prince would also fall into the category of unassailable business expenses , since a man of Philip 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to walk around constantly with his hands folded behind his back and not cramp up . But then you 'd get to some sticky items  --  divorce lawyers , for instance , and the monthly charges on those cellular phones that the royals are always using to whisper  | endearments into the ears of people they do not happen to be married to , and the upkeep of those awful-looking little dogs the queen harbors . Which brings up what seems to be the central question in all of this  --  not whether the queen can be taxed but whether the queen can be audited . What if she did claim everything as a business expense ? Would the Inland Revenue instruct her to show up at some dingy government office with her accountant and all appropriate records ? Somehow , I do n't think it would happen quite that way . I think that if the queen got hit with an audit , the tax inspector involved would at least show up at the palace . The man chosen for the job would be the sort of seasoned professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him as a thorough , courteous , monumentally discreet , absolutely relentless man named Carruthers . In thirty years of examining the returns of noblemen and pop stars and other special cases , Carruthers has brushed aside sob stories and invitations to Mediterranean yachting holidays and some temptations too scandalous to mention , all the while pressing onward to wring out every shilling the government believes it is due . His fellow workers call him Ice Water Carruthers . One problem he 'd come up against in auditing the queen can be found on practically the first page of Titles and Forms of Address : A Guide to Correct Usage , a book I acquired in England a while back and have held on to just in case I meet a duke over here on a book tour or something : " On presentation to the Queen , the subject does not start the conversation . " In other words , all the queen has to do is keep her mouth shut . It 's not just that the inspector ca n't get any questions answered ; he ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , this is why they sent Carruthers . He is a patient man . He might try to wait the queen out  --  sitting silently and respectfully until finally , bored out of her skull , she says , " Just which figure was it that you wished to talk about , Mr. Carruthers ? " or simply " Hello . " But waiting out the queen is no small task . This is somebody who has sat silent through thousands of ceremonies so boring that all an onlooker can hope for is that a soldier faints or a horse misbehaves . She has walked through thousands of factories , listening to incomprehensible explanations of how widgets are made  --  managing to look vaguely interested , even though the only way she can keep from going mad is to speculate on how in the world Prince Philip is able to keep his hands behind his back that way . She has seen native dances without end . The woman is bore-proof . Thirty minutes into the interview Carruthers begins to think about that . He thinks of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the native dances . Then he thinks of her tiresome children and her hideouslooking dogs . Ice Water Carruthers begins to feel sorry for the queen . He rises , nods in respect , and leaves the palace . Back at Inland Revenue , he tells his superior , " Everything seems to be in order . "  | January 4 , 1993 According to newspaper reports , the idea of Renaissance Weekend , which got a lot of coverage over the New Year 's holiday because Bill Clinton and his family were there , emerged when two couples were sitting around and somebody said , " Would n't it be great to have an occasion to really share some of your innermost thoughts with some very accomplished people ? " Most people would have an easy time answering that question : " No , not really . " When most people feel the need to share their innermost thoughts , they seek out an old friend or a trusted relative , even if that person 's greatest accomplishment was a solid 8-6 record in his final year as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that conversation a dozen years ago was someone named Philip Lader , then the president of a Hilton Head Island resort , who is described in the newspapers as a " major-league networker . " What Lader did , he has recalled , was to organize a gathering of some people he and his friends knew " and others we would like to meet . " ( The **29;157;TOOLONG part is the sign of a networker . ) Over New Year 's holidays ever since , he has brought together people on Hilton Head in the interest of what he calls " personal and national renewal " and assigned them to panels with  | titles like " New Technologies : Personal Implications for the Twenty-first Century . " Is sitting through panel discussions the way some people want to spend New Year 's weekend ? Yes . Are some people 's innermost thoughts about new technologies ? I 'm afraid so . In fact , Lader says that this year , presumably because of Clinton 's presence , he had to turn away any number of people who wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holiday season , wannabe networkers . This brings up the question of exactly what networking is . If you discount Lader 's tendency to describe the people he knows or wants to meet as having demonstrated " innovative achievement on a national or regional level " ? and you can put that language in perspective by understanding that Phyllis George is one of the people so described  --  networking may bring to mind a phrase you always associated with your Uncle Harry , the one who represented several lines of leather goods and was always so particular about the shine on his shoes and the knot in his tie : " making contacts . " I 'm not sure it started out that way . As I remember the time when we first heard a lot of talk about networks , they were formed by like-minded people in real need of allies or support  --  educators who were interested in sharing nontraditional teaching methods , say , or women who felt isolated in large corporate law firms , or newcomers of one sort or another who needed a counterweight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word came to mean a sort of unfocused fattening of the Rolodex . Lader and others emphasize that everyone gets along splendidly during Renaissance Weekend , even though people have widely varying political beliefs , and this reflects a basic principle of what networking has come to mean : it 's more impor-  | tent to know someone than to agree with him . Lader , putting it in almost religious terms , talks about " the very sacred value we give to personal relationships . " That 's the part that reminds you of your Uncle Harry . So what 's the difference these days between making contacts and networking ? That 's easy . Networking comes with panel discussions . The distinction is important . People who were interested in making contacts were simply out to get ahead . Uncle Harry never cared much about the new technologies  --  one of his favorite phrases , after all , was " It 's not what you know but who you know " ? and he would n't have claimed that his effort to meet people who could be of use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Networkers , on the other hand , like to think that they are establishing " personal relationships " with people who share their interest in grappling with what they are prone to call the problems and challenges that face our society  --  a task that naturally might necessitate their occupying important positions in government and industry and academia themselves . Lader himself lost when he ran for governor of South Carolina . He now busies himself as the president of what is described as " the only private university in Australia " ? a description you 'd think a major-league networker would recognize as sounding like a way to say " an Australian university you 've never heard of . " All this may lead you to gather that there is a limit to what can be achieved by networking , even when practiced at a major-league level . On the other hand , Bill Clinton  --  who has been networking at least since high school in Hot Springs  --  was recently elected president of the United States . And Phil Lader knows Bill Clinton .  | January u , 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been identified by the local newspaper as William J. Clinton if he had been elected president of the Fayetteville Rotary Club will be known as Bill Clinton as president of the United States ? It strikes me as odd and it also strikes me as unfortunate . I ca n't help thinking that the further our national politicians grow from the experiences of the general pop-ulation  --  George Bush is certainly not the only national political leader who does not have a long and intimate acquaintanceship with the supermarket line  --  the more they all want to sound like just folks . This is particularly true of any politician who runs for president  --  even those Washington fixtures who would defect to Albania before they 'd give up their car-and-driver . Jimmy Carter started this nickname business ; it should be on his conscience . He was the first president to insist that his nickname be used even for the most formal occasions and the most official proclamations . That did n't make him sound like just folks ; it made him sound like someone you could n't exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a common name made matters even worse . I could imagine some chairman of a  | powerful House committee  --  a man whose gift for keeping names straight had deteriorated over the years  --  saying to one of the notoriously inept congressional lobbyists of that administration , " Who ? Jimmy Carter ? Was n't that the kid who used to park cars at the club ? " Before Jimmy Carter was elected , presidents were known by the names on their birth certificates . When their nicknames were used by people other than their friends , it was usually because a nickname fit better on a campaign button ( i LIKE I KE ) or the headline of a tabloid . But Dwight D. Eisenhower is not listed in the history books as Ike Eisenhower . The previous presidents with the same first name as Clinton are not remembered as Bill Harrison and Bill McKinley and Bill Taft . When Chester Alan Arthur was being introduced from the podium , the speaker did n't say , " I give you the president of the United States  --  Chet Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days , no president could have been more badly brought up than John F. Kennedy , and even he knew enough to go by his proper name instead of just plain Jack . The reason people like Eisenhower and Kennedy had been christened Dwight and John , after all , was so they would have a dignified first name if they happened to be elected president . This sort of naming has long been an American custom ; despite consistent evidence to the contrary , it remains a central American belief that anyone born here , even in the humblest circumstances , has the opportunity to grow up to be president . In a maternity ward somewhere in the United States at this moment , a misty-eyed father of a newborn boy is saying something like , " Why do n't we just call him Butch . I want to name him after Uncle Butch . I love my Uncle Butch . " And the proud mother , gazing down at the child  | in her arms , is saying , " No , this baby is going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president . Presidents are not called Butch . " After Carter left office , there was reason to hope that American presidents would go back to using grown-up names . President Reagan did n't begin the oath of office by saying , " I , Ronnie Reagan . . . " From what I had read about George Bush 's mother , who was still alive when he took office , I could n't imagine that he would have dared try to explain to her that he was planning to sign the first piece of legislation passed during his administration " Poppy Bush . " Fortunately , Bush is a name made for a tabloid headline . The tabs would n't have been able to use his initials , as they did with FDR and JFK ; GHWB sounds like a community development agency in Hartford . But now we 've reverted . Someone I assumed would be President William J. Clinton is just plain Bill . We have n't had a Butch yet , but are n't we headed in that direction ? If it 's now thought that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why not call yourself something even less formal than that ? Think of how much more folksy Buster or Sonny or Bubba would sound . If this sort of thing seems to be working , I suspect that it will be only a matter of time before the proud mother in the maternity ward looks down at the precious bundle in her arms and says , " I want him to have a real chance for the presidency . Let 's call him Stinky. "  | January 25 , 1993 On the " Today " show recently , I heard a representative of the tobacco industry express her disdain for the latest government pronouncement on the connection between smoking and cancer  --  the Environmental Protection Agency 's designation of secondhand smoke as a proven human carcinogen  --  by saying that the EPA was being " politically correct . " " Politically correct " is that rare term which appears at first glance to be positive but is always used negatively . If someone stood up in a faculty senate to say that many would favor the resolution under discussion because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite , using sarcasm that may have sounded a bit less heavyhanded when he tried the speech out on his wife at breakfast that morning . I first heard the term some years ago , in the conversation of my college-age daughter and her friends , and it was always used ironically . Although they were the sort of young people who were concerned about the environment and sensitive to the feelings of minority students , they reserved " politically correct " for those occasions when , say , the wine bottle got tossed into the regular trash for want of a recycling bin . " Uh-oh  --  not awfully PC of you , " someone would remark . It was not said in a  | tone that necessitated removing the bottle from the regular trash . The term soon came to be used by people who wanted to call attention to the possibility that college campuses were suffering from the presence of an entrenched orthodoxy . Some of the people who sounded the alarm were genuinely concerned that , say , a fear of offending racial minorities was having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sounded the alarm , neoconservatives who had previously managed to keep their passionate commitment to the First Amendment in check , were looking for a semantic club to swing at the left  --  the previous weapon , " knee-jerk liberal , " having atrophied and died some years before . Since no one claimed to be politically correct him-self  --  those under suspicion tended to argue that the condition did not exist  --  political correctness could be defined completely by people interested in warning against it . Although it may be that someone somewhere actually argued seriously that short people ought to be called vertically challenged or that pets ought to be called animal companions , for instance , I 'm convinced that by now most of the bizarre euphemisms identified with political correctness were invented in the course of making fun of it . Also , political correctness was defined by those who warned against it as not just any political orthodoxy but political orthodoxy of the liberal good-think variety . Lynne Cheney , a leader of the anti-PC brigade while she ran the National Endowment for the Humanities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was accused of rigging NEH panels in order to prevent academics suspected of left-wing sympathies from receiving grants . George Bush , another decrier of PC , was not considered politically correct when his  | choices for federal judgeships were vetted to make certain that they opposed abortion . Defining political orthodoxy as exclusively liberal has brought a pleasant bonus to the sort of conservative accustomed to holding forth late at night at the country club bar : he can air the same views he has always aired ? views held by nearly every single person he knows  --  and come off in his own mind as a maverick who says what he thinks , consequences be damned . Cliches about the need for poor people to pick themselves up by their own bootstraps or about the importance of women remembering that aggressive behavior destroys femininity are now regularly introduced with the proud phrase , " Well , I 've never been politically correct myself , but ... " And if the country club sage does meet someone who has differing views , he can diminish them by saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " knee-jerk liberal " was used : someone who held a liberal position on some issue was supposed to feel slightly uneasy about it because he could be perceived as following a political orthodoxy rather than thinking for himself . That 's the way the woman from the Tobacco Institute was using " politically correct " against the EPA : because a position is " politically correct " it is not to be taken terribly seriously . A nonsmoker who follows this line of thinking to its logical conclusion can from now on demonstrate that he 's a free spirit by lunching every day in the middle of the smoking section of his favorite res-taurant  --  as tough and independent as the Marlboro man . He wo n't have to worry about anyone 's accusing him of being politically correct . The only thing he 'll have to worry about is lung cancer .  | February 1 , 1993 I keep track of a president 's symbols . I consider this part of my duties . Although Bill Clinton has barely arrived at the White House , I have already begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asked what sort of person he is  --  a list that now includes , among other things , the saxophone and Big Macs and Elvis and male-on-male hugging . I 've now closed out George Bush 's list , which includes horseshoes , pork rinds , golf , Millie , boardingschool friends , and speech without nouns . If Bush now becomes a thoroughly obsessed birdwatcher or a great pastry chef , it will make no difference to the way he is remembered : I have closed out his list . I should note that the George Bush list has no serious overlap with the Bill Clinton list except in the matter of jogging , and , after some discussion with my colleagues , I have decided that jogging and jogging to a McDonald 's are two completely different activities . I 've been keeping such lists for a long time now , and I find that there is rarely any overlap from one president to the next . Dwight D. Eisenhower played golf ; John F. Kennedy played touch football . Lyndon Johnson ate barbecue and Richard Nixon ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on and Jimmy Carter ate grits and Ronald Reagan ate jellybeans.  | Did n't Jimmy Carter ever eat barbecue ? Of course he did , but it was n't his photo-opportunity food . A presidential symbol is n't simply something he does but something he likes to be seen doing . Presidents and their handlers try to use symbols to form an image of what the president is , or what he is n't . George Bush 's connection with pork rinds and country music and horseshoes and a speedboat , for instance , was supposed to erase the image of Bush as an effete eastern preppie  --  although I once revealed , in the course of making my list , that pork rinds were always the biggest seller at the snack bar at Andover . The usefulness of symbols in constructing an image of the president is one reason that presidential symbols do n't have much overlap . A president and his advisers have a pretty good idea of how he wants to be regarded , and it has to be distinctive . You would n't catch Bill Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might catch Bill Clinton eating whatever 's put in front of him . You can see the effectiveness of symbols in creating an impression of a president by trying to imagine familiar presidential symbols attached to the wrong administration . Imagine a fireside chat by Richard Nixon in one of Jimmy Carter 's cardigan sweaters . Imagine Jimmy Carter with FDR 's cigarette holder . Imagine Harry Truman with Jimmy Carter 's teeth . Imagine Bess Truman in one of Nancy Reagan 's Adolfo gowns . Imagine Nancy Reagan stopping at McDonald 's after her morning jog to have a Big Mac and hug a few folks . Occasionally a president 's symbol is analyzed in a way that he and his advisors had n't planned . I usually leave such close analysis to others , but recently I realized that some symbols of the Reagan Administration have turned out to be unconscious symbols of the entire era ? an era noted for materialism and excesses of wealth . For  | instance , Nancy Reagan 's ball gowns , like so much of what was supporting the glitz of the eighties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned . The presence of jellybeans in Ronald Reagan 's office at all times also could be seen as reflecting what became known as Reaganomics : they indicated that , contrary to what your mother told you , it 's perfectly all right to eat only candy , you can have as much as you want , and you can eat it any time of day . Poor George Bush  --  ironically , the very person who had coined the phrase " voodoo economics " for that approach when he ran against Reagan for the Republican presidential nomination  --  inherited the cavities . Symbols change . Toward the end of Ronald Rea-gan 's term , he seemed to lose interest in jellybeans , or maybe he forgot about them , or maybe his handlers finally understood the connection between jellybeans and Reaganomics . If Bill Clinton abandons Big Macs for tofu and brown rice , he 'll be trying to tell us something . If that happens , you 'll know : it will be noted on my list . I consider this one of my duties .  | February 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential to split the animal rights movement right up the middle , " the voice on the telephone said . " The issue is mandatory seat belts for clogs . " My informant  --  I ' 11 call him Wayne Marshall  --  was a bit hazy on the details , but from what I could gather , the argument centered on whether the movement should push mandatory seat belts for dogs at the expense of its concentration on two other issues  --  the use of animal fur for coats and the use of animals in laboratories for medical experiments . " How about seat belts for dogs that are being taken to a laboratory for medical experiments ? " I asked Wayne . " Precisely the sort of question that is causing untold divisiveness among those who protect our four-footed friends , " Wayne said . " But those questions are only symptoms of the large issues : Where does our responsibility to man 's best friend end and an interference in his freedom begin ? By mandating seat belts for dogs , are we looking out for the best interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I can see that lobbying for mandatory seat belts for ( logs would offend libertarian conservatives , " I said , trying to get into the spirit of the discussion . " They believe that , to the fullest extent possible , government should  | stay out of your life , and I suppose they would believe that government should stay out of your life even if you happen to be a golden retriever . " " On the other hand , " Wayne said , " how do we know that the golden retriever does n't want a seat belt ? How do we know what he would do if he had the ability to read the statistics put out regularly by the National Highway Safety Council or if he had the manual dexterity to buckle a seat belt himself ? " " And how about cats ? " I asked . I was beginning to like this conversation : we just kept asking each other questions , and nobody had to worry about thinking of an answer . " What about cats ? " Wayne said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the responsibility of statisticsreading creatures to assure the safety of dogs by putting in mandatory-seat-belt laws for them , how can we do less for cats ? " " I thought you hated cats , " Wayne said . " In the first place , I do n't hate cats , " I said . " I 'm not a prejudiced person . As I have explained any number of times , I simply have n't yet met a cat that I liked . Also , this is not a matter of likes and dislikes , it 's a matter of a just and humane policy toward animal restraint in moving vehicles . " " Cats are small , " Wayne said . " Yorkshire terriers are small , " I said . " Pomeranians are small . Is this society now valuing life according to size ? Is the safety of a Newfoundland more important to us than the safety of a Chihuahua , even under the new North American Free Trade Agreement ? How about other animals that are commonly kept as pets ? Do we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that meeting that responsibility would require a very tiny seat belt indeed , " Wayne said . p 179 " Are you saying that a country that put a man on the moon can not produce a seat belt for a hamster ? " I said . " It 's a question of how best to use the industrial resources at our disposal , " Wayne said . " Also , if you must know , I hate hamsters . I do n't much like Pomeranians either . They look like hamsters that are overdressed for the occasion . " " Are you saying that you are not troubled by the prospect of a sudden stop by a car carrying an unrestrained Pomeranian ? " I said . " It does n't concern you that a Pomeranian is flying around the car like a carom shot in handball ? " Wayne said that among animal-rights people the controversy over this issue was not really about whether the mandatory-seat-belt law should be extended from dogs to smaller animals but whether human beings should really he in the business of restricting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side  --  they 're called ' betters ' in the movement  --  believe humans have a sacred responsibility to protect dogs , " Wayne said . " The most extreme people on the other side are opposed to not just mandatory-seat-belt laws but also leash laws . ' hey say that we now find ourselves as a society with free-range chickens but no free-range dogs . " " And consider what could happen once you go fur-t her down the slippery slope of regulating animal behav-ior , " I said . " For instance , mandatory-helmet laws for dogs that are riding on the passenger seats of motor-cycles . " " I think you 're catching on to how serious this is , " Wayne said . And he hung up .  | March 1 , 1993 Although a former governor of Arkansas has now been in the White House since the end of January , those residents of Washington who are known for always doing the fashionable thing apparently are n't putting goobers in their Cokes yet . I got this news in a phone call from a friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . My friend  --  I ' 11 call him Odie  --  was pretty steamed about it . He said that this is just another example of people in the rest of the country not taking Arkansas culture seri-ously . " Also , I have n't heard the war cry of the Arkansas Razorbacks once during the president 's speeches to Con-gress , " Odie said . " I thought that when he scored with a particularly eloquent line about how all Americans are going to have to sacrifice to get rid of the deficit , a lot of congressmen would yell out Soo Pig Sooey ! ' or at least Go Hawgs ! ' " I tried to tell Odie that he should n't take the absence of Razorback cheers or goober-clogged Cokes as an insult to his home state . As I wrote not long after the election , Bill Clinton , a man who was indeed born and raised and politically seasoned in Arkansas , nevertheless gives off a mixed cultural signal . A congressman aware of the Oxford influence on Clinton , for instance , might think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speech by saying , in a " Masterpiece Theatre " accent , " Well done " or even " Good on you . " Odie ignored that argument . " By this time in Lyndon Johnson 's administration , the smoke from Texas barbecues was so thick over the Capitol you would have thought that the British were back to burn the place down again , " he said . " When Carter got here , people started eating grits , even though Georgia grits are n't fit for anything much beyond wall spackling . This time , if you mention goobers to these people , they think you 're talking about some German congressman from Wiscon-sin . For those readers who are in danger of making the same mistake , I should probably explain that people in some parts of the South sometimes refer to peanuts as goobers  --  a word apparently brought to this continent by African slaves , along with words like okra and gumbo . In Arkansas , a member of the cognoscenti customarily pours a few salted peanuts into a bottle of CocaCola , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sucked up and devoured . You might think of it as the Arkansas equivalent of Parisians dunking their madeleines into their cafe au lait , except saltier . Somehow , it has always seemed appropriate to call a peanut a goober when it is floating in a Coke . " Well , Coke or R.C. , " Odie said when I checked to make certain I had remembered the custom accurately from some of my forays into Arkansas many years ago from Missouri , where we drank our Cokes straight . I had n't known , in fact , that Royal Crown Cola was also considered an acceptable place to deposit goobers . " Do people ever put goobers into Dr Pepper ? " I asked Odie . " Not unless they 're weird , " he said .  | Happy to be asked to delve into this custom a hit further , Odie said that , being a traditionalist , he always used Tom 's Peanuts , which come in a small cellophane package . " I guess any brand of peanut would taste good , though , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown , " I said , trying to indicate some appreciation of the custom . " The taste of the goober is not the point of the ex-ercise , " Odie said . " The point is that the salt from the goober charges up the fizz and puts a little head on the Coke . It 's the same reason that some people shake a little salt into their beer . " He seemed a bit put out by my ignorance of something that anyone with a deep knowledge of Arkansas should know . I felt terrible about the mistake . People from Arkansas can be awfully touchy . After Odie and I had hung up , I found myself hoping that people in Washington do start to show their appreciation of Arkansas lore . I 'm sure Odic would understand if they varied a bit from the authentic recipe  --  Tom 's Peanuts in a ten-ounce bottle of Coke or R.C. I tried to imagine the day when Odie , at an A-list cocktail party in Georgetown , suddenly notices that the man next to him is drinking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He starts looking closely and sees goobers in Perrier water . A few feet away an elegantlooking man is drinking a Stolichnaya on the rocks , and the rocks have goobers on them . " Go Hawgs ! " Odie shouts . " Soo Pig Sooey ! "  | March 22 , 1993 Like a lot of people who live in New York , I 've been getting telephone calls from friends around the country who want to know what is going on with the New York Post , a tabloid that has lately been making even juicier news than it customarily reports . At one point in the festivities , the editors and reporters of the Post published a ten-page spread attacking the competence and character and even mental stability of Abe Hirschfeld , the man who seemed to be their new boss  --  asking the question " Who Is This Nut ? " and answering with such descriptions as " drooling old fool . " For a week , Hirschfeld seemed loath to let a day pass without both hiring and firing Pete Hamill as editor . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years has been mentioned in the columns as the escort of people like Shirley MacLaine and Jacqueline Onassis , was for the first time pictured in the New York Times being kissed on the mouth , and the person kissing him was Abe Hirschfeld . What I try to explain to my friends from out of town is that the current imbroglio is simply a colorful version of an old Manhattan script in which real estate sharks and other moguls known for their shrewd investment strategies battle over the right to buy a newspaper that  | everyone agrees holds all the financial promise of a bad heroin habit . In New York , no one is surprised to see the Post bought by Hirschfeld  --  a parking lot magnate and sometime political candidate whose best-known connection with the press before this was an incident in which he replied to a question by spitting on the reporter who asked it . Nor is anyone surprised that there are a passel of other millionaires waiting for him to stumble so that they might have the opportunity to lose $300,000 a week . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now owned by Mortimer Zuckerman , a real estate developer who also owns The Atlantic and U.S. News . The owner whose bankruptcy gave Hirschfeld his shot at the Post is Peter Kalikow , a real estate developer . Most of the weekly magazines and newspapers of New York have been bought in recent years by people whose fortunes are based on Wall Street money-fiddling or real estate . The man Hirschfeld seems to have bested in his bid for the Post made his money collecting accounts receivable . Of course , newspaper ownership has always attracted rich men . ( Among American journals of opinion , on the other hand , there has been a tradition of editors attaining their post by virtue of having a wife rich enough to buy the place . Years ago I pointed out why this could be considered a healthy custom : the opportunity to pontificate weekly tends to make a man full of himself , and this way his ego can be held in check by having a wife who occasionally says , " Get off your high horse , Harry , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cook . " ) When the rich men are real estate sharks , they raise suspicions that they 're actually interested in the building the newspaper occupies or in controlling an editorial page important to the politicians who decide on building per-  | snits and tax abatements . But I think that in most cases the real estate sharks , like other rich people who own newspapers , simply want to be taken seriously . They know they have always been sneered at by reporters , even though ( or maybe because ) most reporters are people who , as Hirschfeld often says , " could n't write a check for $10 . " A real estate developer who wants to own a newspaper is in the position of the little rich boy who wants to play in the scruffy sandlot baseball game and knows he wo n't be invited to unless he provides the ball and bats . Occasionally the rich buyers actually become involved in the editorial product . Zuckerman writes a column for U.S. News . I 've often tried to imagine the first meeting he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think we need to find a columnist on world affairs who has a fresh voice , " Zuckerman says . After a long silence among the people whose salaries he pays , someone finally says , " Maybe it 'd be good to have someone with real estate experience . " But most of the real estate sharks just want the presence of public figures at their dinner tables and the respect of the down-at-the-heel reporters who have always sneered at them . What they forget is that reporters traditionally reserve their purest contempt for the boss , no matter what his background is . You only have to look at Pete Hamill 's expression as he 's being kissed by Abe Hirschfeld.  | April 19 , 1993 A while back , the New York Zoological Society was widely ridiculed for announcing that the Bronx Zoo and the Central Park Zoo would from then on be known not as zoos but as " wildlife conservation parks . " As you may remember , the president of the society , William Conway , said that the change had come about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfortunate secondary meaning . He quoted the American Heritage Dictionary , whose definitions of " zoo " include " a place or situation marked by confusion or disorder . " As an example of the secondary meaning overwhelming the first , Conway mentioned the widespread habit among New Yorkers of referring to Yankee Stadium during George Steinbrenner 's reign as the Bronx Zoo . He also mentioned the experience of a friend who got into a taxi and asked to be taken to the zoo . " Which zoo ? " the driver said . " The whole city 's a zoo . " Because of fallout from the new usage , Conway maintained , a zoological park now acquires a reputation as the sort of place George Steinbrenner might be operating , even though , in Conway 's words , " we 're not confused or disordered . " Having been a fairly regular visitor to both the Bronx Zoo and the Central Park Zoo over the years , I can confirm that neither has ever seemed confused or disordered and that neither deserves association in the public mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an admirer of the penguin exhibit at the Central Park Zoo , and I can testify that the penguins , far from appearing confused , seem to know precisely what they are up to . On a personal note , I have to say that many years ago one of the first invitations I extended to the woman who was to become my wife was an invitation to accompany me to the Bronx Zoo , where I intended to bowl her over with my knowledge of the takin , a hairy beast from Burma that some authorities had identified as the smelliest animal in the world . She was at least mildly impressed , so you might say that I have a bias in favor of the New York Zoological Society . The society needs some defending these days . A number of commentators have said that its decision to begin calling a zoo a wildlife conservation park was an example of just how far the wacky modern weakness for euphemism can go . But it occurs to me , after chewing on this issue for a while , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not , in fact , go far enough . Take , for example , the defenders of the turkey . That 's right : the turkey . In the same American Heritage Dictionary that offers an unfortunate secondary meaning for " zoo , " the first definition for " turkey " is " a large North American bird ( Meleagris gallopavo ) that has brownish plumage and a bare , wattled head and neck and is widely domesticated for food . " Fair enough . But the definitions that follow include " a person considered inept or undesirable " and " a failure , especially a failed theatrical production or movie . " Or how about the gorilla ? As anybody who has spent much time in what used to be the Bronx Zoo can tell you , the gorilla is a particularly pleasant animal  --  a quiet vegetarian that is described in my encyclopedia as " shy  | and peaceful . " And yet the American Heritage Dictionary has as its second definition " a brutish man . " The third definition is even shorter and nastier : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken , which for many years has had the secondary meaning of coward . There are those , I know , who believe that in this case the secondary meaning flows legitimately from the character of the animal  --  that a chicken is , in fact , cowardly , just as a rat is , as an animal , the sort of nogoodnik that George Raft used to play in the movies . It 's true that those nature programs on television never seem to show a chicken ferociously defending her young from an attacking wildebeest or stingray , but I have always thought that laying an egg is in itself an act requiring considerable bravery . There can be no claim that the turkey is responsible for its unfortunate secondary meaning . The turkey has its faults  --  dumbness is one ; a serious ugliness problem is another ; a tendency for its breast meat to dry out is a third  --  but those faults have nothing to do with , say , a truly inept musical version of Remembrance of Things Past which closes after one performance . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the word " zoo , " has been sullied so thoroughly by a second meaning that it should simply be abandoned . Some might argue that the turkey should be called , say , the wattlefowl . Personally , I would be willing to entrust such decisions to the New York Zoological Society .  | April 26 , 1993 Like many of his contemporaries , my friend Nick , who graduates from college this year , is unenthusiastic about going out into the biting and clawing and scratching of the real world . He thinks he could afford to avoid all that unpleasantness if Disney would just make one of those heartwarming animal movies about his pet turtle , Steven . " It would be sort of like Lassie , Come Home , " Nick said to me the other day , " except that since you 're dealing with a turtle , of course , you could n't wait until it got all the way home . " " I hate to be in the position of throwing cold water on the hopes and dreams of the young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steven just , well , an ordinary turtle ? " " Not was , ' " Nick corrected me . " Just because you do n't see a turtle every day of your life does not mean that turtle is dead . " " I 'll rephrase the question , " I said . " Is n't Steven just an ordinary turtle ? " " A carnivorous turtle , " Nick pointed out . " Steven is no salad-eating turtle . " I had to give Nick that point . I remembered that . Steven 's carnivorousness made him among the bestknown turtles in our neighborhood . I should say that Nick and I both live in Greenwich Village , which has many nice qualities but is not a perfect environment for ,  | say , a Saint Bernard . In the Village , a turtle is a fairly common pet . While Nick was growing up , the best-known pet store in the Village was a place on Bleecker called Exotic Aquatics . Over the years I ventured into Exotic Aquatics a few times myself . That 's where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parents , was heading to buy a lizard when the little boy whose hand I was holding looked up and said , in a courteous effort to make conversation with a strange grownup , " Are you divorced yet ? " Exotic Aquatics was , of course , where Nick and his mother , my friend Elizabeth , bought Steven . Nick does n't remember where Steven got his name , although he says that if the Disney people got interested he 's certain he could come up with a heartwarming anecdote on the subject . I suspect that the turtle was named after a bologna-sandwich-eating classmate of Nick 's at P.S. 3 , where carnivores were rather rare . Nick 's mention of carnivorousness had focused my memory of his turtle . In those days my daughters , who are contemporaries of Nick 's , had a couple of particularly destructive cats , and I remember that there were times when I used to daydream about feeding the cats to Steven . As far as I know , Steven never ate a cat  --  and , in fairness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , Disney could just leave that part out even if he did . What he ate mostly , according to Nick and Elizabeth , was dried bits of shrimp , which could be purchased in large packages from places that were used to dealing with people who owned carnivorous turtles . Steven was also known for the requirement he placed on his owners to feed him the shrimp by hand . You could n't just put some shrimp in Steven 's tank ; he p 191 would ignore them for days . Apparently , Steven considered the bother of going over to gulp down the shrimp on his own an option that was not preferable to starving to death . It was the constant hand-feeding that finally made Elizabeth abandon her efforts to care for Steven after Nick went to college  --  that and hearing on some nature program that turtles can live thirty or forty years . Nick took Steven to college for a while , but he and his roommates eventually grew bored with hand-feeding bits of Big Macs and Buffalo chicken wings to a turtle . Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would eat a cat . Finally , Nick told me , it was decided to take Steven to a pond near a friend 's house in the country and return him to nature . " But how could he have survived with nobody there to hand-feed him ? " I asked Nick . " That 's the great part of the plot , " Nick said . " I figure he must have been befriended by a kindly old fisherman , or a cute little boy who says Aw shucks ' a lot . We could work that out with the writers . " " I 'm sure you could , " I said . " But if I were you , I 'd go ahead with some job interviews . Just in case . "  | May 17 , 1993 At seven o'clock one evening , on the " MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour , " I saw David Gergen and Mark Shields , two commentators I admire , agree that so far Bill Clinton has not been tough enough to be an effective president ; they said that nobody in Washington is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw Lethal Weapon 2 , with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover . I decided that Mel Gibson should be president . Mel would be tough enough . Here 's what would happen if Sam Nunn , without asking President Mel Gibson , started holding hearings that featured a lot of war heroes who , according to their testimony , are n't afraid of an entire battalion of Chinese regulars but would be terrified by the thought of taking a shower in the same room with a homosexual : Mel would sling Sam Nunn headfirst through the passengerside window of a car . Then he would open the rear door , stick the senator 's head in , and slam the door on it four or five times . After that , I suspect , Senator Nunn would be afraid of Mel . Maybe I 'd better stop right here and explain that the reason I 'm talking about Mel Gibson rather than Danny Glover is not because I hold with the theory that the country is not ready to elect a black man president . The country is ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be a black man who people in Washington are afraid of . I do n't mean afraid of in the way they 're afraid of any black man who walks into the convenience store while they 're doing some late-evening shopping  --  even a black man who is wearing a suit and tie and happens to be the deputy undersecretary of labor . I mean afraid of in the way people in Washington are afraid of a president who is tough enough . Judging by Lethal Weapon 2 , there 's not as much reason to be afraid of Danny Glover as there is to be afraid of Mel Gibson . Do n't get me wrong : Danny is tough . I personally observed one bad guy kick him eight or ten times to the head without even raising a welt , and I saw Danny dispatch another bad guy with an electric staple gun shot to the midsection . ( After I saw that , I inspected my electric drill  --  I do n't have an electric staple gun ? and I was surprised to see that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Danny seems pretty much in control of his emotions . Mel is out of control , and that 's a lot scarier . It 's true that the bad guys in this movie killed both of the women Mel loved , and , as they used to say at home , that sort of thing smarts some . But I think Danny would have kept his cool in a similar situation . Mel , on the other hand , emits what I believe could be called animal sounds as he slams a person 's head in the car door . I think one of those animal sounds would scare the bejesus out of Senator Nunn . The senator , after all , is not someone who has himself faced a battalion of Chinese regulars . As I remember , Senator Nunn , the Hill 's acknowledged master of defense policy , got his own personal military seasoning in one of those ten-day Coast Guard programs that people used to  | try to slide into in order to keep out of the draft . The Coast Guard is an estimable branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If some of those western senators tried to pressure the Gibson Administration on the issue of grazing rights on federal lands , here 's what would happen : Mel would ask them over to the White House . Then he 'd beat the living daylights out of them . He 'd choke them with chains . He 'd stomp on their heads . All the while he 'd emit animal noises . After that , the western senators would n't think of trying to push Mel around . They 'd be afraid of him . And how would President Gibson deal with a Republican filibuster ? I know that from watching the end of the movie . He certainly would n't pussyfoot around the way Bill Clinton did , telling reporters that the Republicans were thwarting the desires of the majority of the American people . That kind of talk does n't make anyone afraid . No , Mel would handle it a different way . First he 'd call Danny Glover , the White House counsel . He 'd say , " Just go in the front door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of the rest . " C-Span would cover the whole thing until Mel got around to breaking the C-Span camera over the head of the Senate minority leader . After that , even C-Span would be afraid of Mel . Yes , Mel 's tough enough to be president .  | July 12 , 1993 Can you hurt a country 's feelings ? I 'm not talking about provoking a country . You can definitely do that . If you try to kill our former president , we bomb you ; we were provoked . What I 'm talking about is hurting a country in a way that makes it feel kind of pouty and unloved and not wanting to do much except sit up late in a darkened room and sip Scotch while listening to old Dinah Washington records . For instance , were Canada 's feelings hurt when an internal State Department document that got out to the press listed fifty countries in order of their importance to the United States and showed Canada to be only number nine ? Before we go any further , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was pretty dumb of the State Department to make a list ranking fifty countries in order of their importance to the United States . I would agree with you . I would agree that the list in question was very much like the list you begged your Cousin Doris not to make in sixth grade  --  the one that listed her twenty-five best friends in the order of how much they meant to her . You said that if anybody ever came across that list , a lot of people would be hurt , and a couple of them might  | be hurt enough to give Cousin Doris five in the mush . But she made the list anyway . And just as you feared , the list was seen by Trish Baxter , the snoopiest little gossip in the class , who took great pleasure in informing Wanda LeBrun that Wanda was only fourteenth , four places behind the super-weird Marguerite Waldeen , which meant that Wanda LeBrun disinvited Doris to her birthday party , which was the reason Doris later gave for what she did to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork in the road that set Doris in the direction of being , thirty years later , what her schoolmates often call " the last hippie in Fort Wayne , Indiana . " Unlike Cousin Doris , the State Department has cabinets full of stamps that say FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY and CONFIDENTIAL . The stamps do n't do any good , though , since the place is full of Trish Baxters . The list of the fifty countries most important to the United States was first revealed in a London newspaper , The Independent , but I read about it in a Canadian newspaper , the Toronto Globe and Mail . I have to say that the first sentence sounded a little , well , hurt : " WASHING-TON  --  Canada may be first in the American wallet , as the leading trading partner of the United States , but it is ninth in importance to the United States , according to the State Department . " I wanted to reassure Canada , the way you 'd reassure a person whose feelings might have been hurt , but how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Canada , person to country . The Canada I was talking to did not look like a Mountie or a hockey player ; Canada hates to be envisioned as a Mountie or a hockey player . The Canada I was talking to looked like Raymond Massey . " Oh , do n't mind me , " Canada is saying . " I 'm just p 197 here to provide a market for your tacky manufactured goods and maintain a couple of baseball teams that make it marginally less silly for you to call your little championship the World Series . " " I 'm sorry your feelings were hurt , " I say . " Feelings hurt ? " Canada says . " Not at all . Do n't give it a thought . Well , I 'm sure you have better things to do than to pass the time with a country whose importance in your eyes is two notches below Mexico . I 'm sure you and Germany , your numero uno , have something planned for this evening . " " You know , we 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven summit of the leading industrial nations , even though your population 's less than half the population of France or Italy or the U.K. , " I say . " I guess whichever country 's number eight must be pretty envious of you . " " I will not be patronized by a country that thinks Sylvester Stallone is an actor , " Canada says . Even in my imagination , in other words , attempting to reassure Canada was not a success . I ca n't imagine what we could do to make amends . It occurs to me that , just for a start , the State Department could put out a list of countries that are geographically closest to us . Canada would be tied for first place .  | July 26 , 1993 I saw myself on trial , accused by my wife and daughters of falling asleep while we watch movies on the VCR . " Not guilty , your honor , " I say , but the only reason I say that is that this court does not seem set up to accommodate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you could present evidence that I happened to be , in a technical sense , asleep  --  testimony , for instance , that I was snoring  --  I have quite a good explanation . " The judge says that if I want to present testimony in mitigation , there will be plenty of time for that after the guilty verdict . I shift impatiently in the dock . Apparently I 'm going to have to stand throughout the trial , like a defendant in one of those movies set at the time of the French Revolution . I suppose this is to prevent me from falling asleep . If the judge would let me speak , I 'd say that for one thing , the movies my family rents are n't noisy enough . If the only noise coming from the screen is people whispering sweet nothings into each other 's ears , the sound is the equivalent of the bedroom curtains rustling in the evening breeze , and the natural response is to go to sleep . It stands to reason that the most difficult movie to stay awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of  | plays . If someone who has just arrived in New York with a jet-lag problem wants to see a play , I always look through the paper to see if anything by Sam Shepard is on . About the time an exhausted traveler is ready to doze off at a play by Sam Shepard , somebody on stage is likely to throw a chair against the wall . This , by the way , explains why my first question about a movie that someone in my family is considering for rental is always " Does it have any car chases ? " Members of my family seem to think that this question reveals me to be the sort of thug who likes action movies because there is n't much dialogue he can understand . Wrong . Car chases are noisy . There 's the roar of the motor , the screech of the wheels , the sound of gunfire coming from at least one car . Often there 's the sound of a car hitting a wall and exploding into flames . I have never fallen asleep during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecuting attorney is shuffling through the documents on the table in front of him , ' apparently ready to ask a question . Finally he says , " There was recently a movie called Raise the Red Lantern , made , I believe , in the People 's Republic of China . " He pauses to shuffle through the documents again . Talk about unfair questions ! Talk about bad examples ! " Your honor , " I say , " this is not exactly your typical movie . " The judge reminds me that this is not the time for my explanations . If I were allowed to explain at this point , I would say that I had concerns about Raise the Red Lantern from the start . By chance , it had shown in a neighboring household the previous evening , and I had an opportunity to ask a member of that household  --  Ezra , who 's about eighteen  --  what it was like .  | " Were there any car chases ? " I asked . Ezra thought for a while . " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No cars ! There could be trouble . My wife likes those movies made from nineteenth-century English nov-els  --  the ones that are mostly people talking to each other in carriages . The clip-clop of those horses ' hooves is like the clickety-clack of a train  --  a lullaby . " " I did n't notice any horses , " Ezra said . " How did they get from one place to another ? " " They did n't exactly go anywhere , " Ezra said . In my desperation , I took a long shot . " Did it remind you at all of Bullitt , with Steve McQueen ? " I asked Ezra . " The one with the car chase up and down those steep hills in San Francisco ? " " Not at all , " Ezra said . The prosecuting attorney was ready to continue . " Did you happen to see a videotape of Raise the Red Lantern ? " I wanted to tell him that in this movie people spoke softly , in a foreign language . I wanted to tell him that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lower the lantern , raise the lantern  --  and that the strongest rituals most of us have in modern life are bedtime rituals . " Yes or no ? " the prosecuting attorney said . " I saw part of it , " I said weakly . It was then that my wife shook me . " If you 're going to sleep , you might as well go upstairs and go to bed , " she said . " Guilty , " I said .  | August 2 , 1993 According to figures compiled by Common Cause , Edgar Bronfman was the leading contributor to the Republican Party in the 1992 elections . Bronfman , the chairman of Seagram 's , forked over $450,000 in what is called soft money  --  which may sound like the sort of money that 's in danger of melting in your pocket or sticking together in your wallet but is , in fact , regular American cash . Soft money , in this usage , is money contributed to a candidate 's political party rather than to his campaign , so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one person can give to an individual candidate and ban corporate contributions to individual candidates altogether . The softness , in other words , is in the regulation , not the money : the regulation can be bent enough to allow in half a million dollars . If people in Washington were more careful about language , the money would not be called soft money but loophole money . Despite $450,000 of loophole money from Edgar Bronfman , George Bush lost . There are times  --  when commentators point out the similarities between the Clinton deficit-reduction scheme and the one presented by the last administration , for instance , or when Bill Clinton complains about the " gridlock thing " ? when this may be difficult to keep in mind , but it is undeniably true .  | You might think , therefore , that these days Edgar Bronfman is dispirited over having dropped a large bundle in a losing cause . You might imagine him shaking his head sadly as friends mumble phrases like " Tough luck , Edgar " and " You 'll get ' em next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eddie baby . " Or you might picture him as a bitter man , bending the ear of everyone at the club about the incompetence of the Bush campaign . You might picture him saying that he should have known enough to give the $450,000 with a couple of conditions : " Recipients agree not to permit candidate to call his opponents bozos ' in final week of campaign , " say , or " Recipients agree not to make illegal search of State Department passport files in an effort to prove that opposing candidate or his mother might have been spies in Arkansas for the Soviet Union . " Or you might imagine Edgar Bronfman as defiant enough to display an upmarket version of those bumper stickers that say things like DO N'T BLAME ME  --  I VOTED FOR BUSH . His would presumably say DO N'T BLAME ME  --  I GAVE $450,000 TO THE REPUBLICANS . I suspect that Edgar Bronfman has not , in fact , been made dispirited or bitter or defiant by the Republican defeat in the presidential election of 1992 . Why ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know , he was in a chipper mood on election night . After all , one of his sides won . Bronfman was not the only campaign contributor who was generous to both sides . Last spring , to accompany an editorial arguing that the soft-money loophole should be closed , the New York Times ran a list of a dozen or so corporations that contributed a lot of money to both parties in 1991 and 1992 . The list ran under the heading HEDGING THEIR BETS . Philip Morris , for instance , spread the money around p 203 pretty much the way Bronfman did , giving the Republican National Committee $406,250 and the Democratic National Committee $152,000 . RJR Nabisco and Atlantic Richfield were also in the category of roughly half a million dollars , and they also put their eggs in two baskets . When I read the list in the Times , what came to mind was how it could be used as the basis for an essay question on a national examination for , say , honors students in high school civics : " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential elections . In your essay , explain this practice without using the word bribery . ' " Is it possible , for instance , that the CEO of , say , Merrill Lynch is simply trying to honor all shades of political opinion among his employees ? Could it be that having already decided to give the Republicans $155,200 on the grounds that they 're pro-business , he gives $109,300 to the Democrats because one company vice-president who 's a sailing freak is wild about Al Gore 's plan to clean up the oceans ? Or is this just corporate America 's way of making certain that the election-night party is a joyous occasion no matter how the voting goes ? I can imagine what the Philip Morris party must have been like last November 3 ? everyone madly smoking , the television volume turned full blast to carry above those hacking coughs . News of Clinton winning New York ? Break out the champagne . Bush pulls ahead in Texas ? Cheers around the room . " We win ! We win ! " the assembled executives shout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did .  | August 23 , 1993 Friends and acquaintances of the chicken that played tic-tac-toe in Chinatown are grateful to Michael T. Kaufman for giving the bird such a dignified sendoff in the New York Times . There have been congressmen buried with less imposing obituaries . Kaufman sounds like someone who spent many of his own quarters to face the chicken in tic-tac-toe  --  pressing buttons on the scoreboard to indicate his choices , then waiting with trepidation as the chicken , pecking at a board in a private area of his cage behind some opaque glass , registered his invariably brilliant countermoves . Standing in front of that playing field , where backlit letters came on to keep track of the X 's and 0 's and to announce " Your Turn " or " Bird 's Turn , " Kaufman wrote , " For those of us who have played the chicken , the sight of his empty box evokes feelings of sadness , if not quite tragedy . " My sentiments exactly . When it came to accounting for the chicken 's uncanny skill , Kaufman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nitpickers , but he does so in a dismissive sort of way ( " So what if its ability to beat or tie us had more to do with the wiring of the electronic game board than with its skill ? " ) . He makes it clear that his sympathies are with those who always believed that this was one smart chicken . Throughout the piece he  | treats the chicken respectfully as a worthy competitor , in the sort of tone that might have been used by Gene Tunney to comment on the sad passing of Jack Dempsey . This recently deceased chicken  --  called Willy by the proprietors of the electronic-games arcade on Mott Street where he worked  --  had been employed as a tic-tac-toe player for only two years , but was only the latest in a line of tic-tac-toe-playing chickens that stretched back years or maybe even decades . When I read Kaufman 's piece , it occurred to me that I probably never actually faced Willy in a game , since I changed a number of years ago from someone who played the chicken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken in tic-tac-toe . Six or eight years ago , I wrote about one of those adventures  --  taking a Canadian friend I called John Fraser to Mott Street to test his mettle against the chicken . I reported that when Fraser had looked over the situation , he said , " But the chicken gets to go first ! " " But he 's a chicken , " I said . " You 're a human being . Surely there should be some advantage in that . " Not enough advantage for Fraser , who dropped two in a row before eking out a tie . I later acknowledged that the complaint about the chicken 's getting the first turn ? a complaint made by nearly everyone I took to the ar-cade  --  was not the worst response I ever heard a human being make to the prospect of playing tic-tac-toe against a chicken . A number of visitors have followed that with a second comment : " The chicken plays every day . I hav-e n't played for years . " I suppose I 've seen Willy play as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can testify that Willy was professional at all times . Without wanting to be critical , I have to report that this is more than I can say for Willy 's predecessor . Once when I was  | there , that chicken turned round and round in the back of the cage rather than beginning the game , and then laid an egg  --  as if remembering , just for a moment , that it was not a competition-level athlete but a chicken . Kaufman managed to solve an old mystery about the chicken 's origin . The writer Roy Blount , Jr. ? who is known for his skill at crossword puzzles but also happens to be deft at tic-tac-toe  --  has always claimed that in Arkansas some years ago he met the people who trained such chickens , and that they turned out to be former graduate students of B. F. Skinner , the renowned Harvard behaviorist . I always wanted to believe Blount , partly because that would be yet another refutation of the notion that graduate school is of no use in the real world . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas , at a place called Animal Behavior Enterprises . Sounds right . But he also found that the firm is no longer listed in the Hot Springs telephone book . Willy may have been the last tic-tac-toe-playing chicken we 'll ever see . John Fraser will be terribly sad to hear that . From what I 'm told , he has spent a lot of the past six or eight years practicing for a rematch .  | September 27 , 1993 Not long ago , a friend of mine told me that President Clinton is younger than the Beatles . This was said in the tone of someone offering an interesting but little-known fact , the way I might say , " The largest egg relative to the size of the bird that is laying it is laid by the kiwi bird , native to New Zealand , " or " Nova Scotia is completely free of poisonous snakes . " Most of my interesting but little-known facts happen to be about animals . I have a friend whose interesting but little-known facts are usually about medicine . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history lasted sixty-five years . On my bulletin board I still have a headline he sent me : 21 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE NO TEETH AT ALL . This was sent many years ago . For all I know , the number may be up to 30 or 35 million Americans by now  --  or , given the cumulative effect over the years of fluoridated water and improved dentistry , the number may be down to , say , 18 million Americans . Judging by President Clinton 's performance in answering questions about his health care proposals , I suspect he knows precisely how many million Americans have no teeth at all . He probably knows how the United States compares , on a tooth-per-capita basis , with other industrialized countries . He may even have some ideas on how to re-  | duce the number of Americans with no teeth or , to put it another way , how to increase the number of American teeth . It occurs to me that this is not the sort of thing that the Beatles would know . An acquaintance of mine who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know only two or three facts . He puts them to his friends in the form of questions fairly regularly  --  forgetting that he asked the same question six or eight months before  --  and is always surprised to find his questions answered correctly . " What 's the largest state  --  in area  --  east of the Mis-sissippi ? " he 'll ask me . " I would say Georgia , " I 'll answer . He always looks a little disappointed at hearing the right answer , but he puts a good face on it . " That 's very good , " he 'll say . " Excellent . Fine . Not many people know that . " The person who told me that Bill Clinton is younger than the Beatles does not specialize in interesting but little-known facts about presidents . She is not one of those people who can tell you how many left-handed presidents there have been or how many presidents have names that turn out to be an anagram for " sanctimoni-ous . She specializes in interesting but little-known facts about the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me that if James Dean had lived he would be old enough to move to one of those retirement communities that do n't allow anyone under fifty . I expect a call from her on the day Dean would have become eligible to collect Social Security . " He and his wife would have been living in one of those ranch houses with the painted pebbles for a lawn , " she 'll say . " They 'd  | have an R.V. and a couple of grandchildren . By now , he would have started referring to her as Ma . " Even though my friend might have told me about the Beatles and the president as a fact about the passage of time  --  one of those mop-haired lads could be president now , except for being from Liverpool  --  you could take it as a way of pointing out how young Bill Clinton is . You could even take it to mean that he is too young to be president  --  either because people his age do not have the wisdom that comes with years or because their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some perspective on American society . " How can we be governed by a man who experienced nothing before the Jefferson Airplane ? " people who have that interpretation say . " What good is it to talk about the big picture with a man who has no basic firsthand experience with the music of Perry Como ? " On the other hand , you could hear that President Clinton is younger than the Beatles and rejoice in the country 's having a young and vital leader  --  someone who has the energy to count American teeth .  | October 18 , 1993 I read in the New York Times that Michael Milken , the junk-bond wizard and thief , is now a popular lecturer at the business school of the University of California at Los Angeles . This can be seen as good news for Leona Helmsley , who would presumably be UCLA 's idea of an appropriate professor of real estate tax practices , as soon as she finishes up at the halfway house . Is Jim Bakker available to teach a UCLA school of religion course called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or is he still in the slammer ? It 's not always easy these days to keep up with the academic heavy-hitters . If you think Milken is on hand to lecture students about how to avoid the temptation to enrich yourself by stealing from your clients and others , think again . According to Francis X. Clines , the reporter who wrote the piece in the Times , if Milken is asked about such matters as the six counts of securities fraud he pleaded guilty to , he " discusses Galileo and other penalized visionaries proved right by history . " One student in the class , Art Stanyakovsky , told Clines that Milken is " the smartest man in this country , " and another , Scott Ragsdale , said Milken is " a great man  --  a martyr , not a crook . It 's not fair , punishing him p 211 simply because society can not understand how one man could make $500 million in a single year . " This is apparently fairly typical of the thinking of UCLA students who have signed up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the line that Milken has spent millions spreading through the media . According to Milken 's flacks , he is a dynamic and constructive and extraordinarily generous entrepreneur ? the victim of envious and small-minded bureaucrats who could n't stand the way he thumbed his nose at the establishment . Does that sound familiar ? It should . It 's the same thing they used to say about John Gotti . In case mentioning Gotti whets the appetite of UCLA 's faculty recruiters , I should add that it 's difficult to predict whether he will be released from prison before he is the age of a professor emeritus . So UCLA probably should n't count on him to do a course in the business school called " Competitive Initiatives 2i5 : The Mob Rubout in Theory and Practice . " From what I gather from the Times article , UCLA officials , when asked to explain Milken 's presence , point out that technically he is merely an unpaid guest lecturer in somebody else 's class  --  a guest who happens to come with his own production crew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the country . And who shares in the copyright of the filmed lectures ? You got it on the first guess : UCLA . Not paying Milken presumably is supposed to give UCLA what used to be called " deniability " in the Watergate days . Speaking of which , John Mitchell and Bob Haldeman are deceased and would therefore not be available to teach at the UCLA law school 's class in obstruction of justice , but John Erlichman is around . For its share of the copyright  --  plus , I suspect , some  | dreams of largesse to come  --  UCLA provides reputation laundering . The goal is to give the impression that what lawbreaking Milken did was  --  as his lawyer , Arthur Liman , explained grandly to the press on the courthouse steps after the guilty plea  --  nothing more than some technical violations and " instances in which Michael went too far in helping his clients . " That 's right : before the judge had decided on the sentence , Liman , in a speech to the television cameras , falsely characterized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Stanyakovsky should ask Milken in class discussion is the question I could n't seem to get answered at the time : " If you 're the smartest man in the country , why did you put your fate in the hands of a lawyer who could do something that dumb ? " When the judge , Kimba Wood , did hand down the sentence  --  a much stiffer one than had been predicted ? she explained in lucid detail what Milken had done , making it clear that the only difference between him and a common criminal was that he had made off with an uncommon amount of money . And what is the difference between Milken and other ex-cons ? Why is he respectable enough to be teaching at the UCLA business school ? The answer turns out to be pretty much the same : he 's got an uncommon amount of money left .  | October 25 , 1993 I was n't surprised to hear that the hot sauce people in Louisiana eat on raw oysters is effective in killing a wicked bacterium called Vibrio vulnificus . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It stands to reason because when you eat that hot sauce you know something is going on . This is a different experience from eating , say , a bowl of cereal or a cheese sandwich or an apple . You can feel Louisiana hot sauce begin its work . You 're aware that a process is taking place . A whole lot is happening . Just what , of course , was a mystery until a team from Louisiana State University Medical Center in New Orleans announced the result of some research it had been doing . Before that , there was no way to tell what was going on . If the researchers had come up with proof that the steady ingestion of hot sauce gradually puts a hole in your spleen , I suppose I would n't have been surprised at that , either . I just knew it was something . On the other hand , killing a virus sounds about right . There 's a certain cauterizing feeling about the hot sauce when it 's prepared just right . Also , now that I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oysters with in New Orleans , all of whom use plenty of hot sauce , seem pretty much free of bugs of any kind . Most people who are accustomed to eating highly  | spiced food take it for granted that there are curative effects . I knew a man in Kentucky who used to say , just before he poured some of his homemade hot pepper sauce on your turnips , " If you 've got a tapeworm , this may not kill it , but it 'll sure give it a start . " I 've always been confident that hot food does more for the body than simply clear the sinus passages . I was persuaded of that partly by the example of my Uncle Benny , who used to pickle the tomatoes he grew in his back yard . It was said that Uncle Benny made the best pickled tomatoes in town ; you had to take that on faith , though , because Uncle Benny himself was the only one who could eat them . They were too hot for everyone else . Uncle Benny was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attribute his longevity to anything particular about the way he conducted his life , but now I realize he was about as safe from Vibrio vulnificus as anyone who ever lived . For all we know , every time some of those nasty little things started to nest somewhere in Uncle Benny 's innards , he strolled over to the pickle barrel . Powee ! What I 'd gathered about the palliative nature of hot food from observing my oyster-eating friends in New Orleans and my Uncle Benny was what the scientists would call merely anecdotal . That is , it was n't learned from systematic scientific experiments under strictly controlled conditions . The LSU study changed all that . It showed , under laboratory conditions , that six different brands of Louisiana hot sauce can not only kill the Vibrio vulnificus but also inhibit the bacterium that causes cholera . It also showed that ketchup is useless in fighting bacteria . That last finding does n't surprise me , by the way . When you eat ketchup , you can tell that nothing much is going on . As somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly  | encouraged by the LSU results , but I 'd like to know about even more diseases I 'm protecting myself from when I pop a few peppers . Cholera has n't been much of a threat in our neighborhood . I would welcome a large study that is easy to calibrate . I was going to suggest studying the health of customers who patronize a restaurant in our neighborhood where you can order a dish on a scale of hotness from one to ten , ten being the hottest . It occurs to me , though , that the statistics would be skewed by the fact that one waitress refuses to take an order higher than six , on humanitarian grounds . Maybe it would be possible to use western New York state , where you could follow the medical histories of people who order Buffalo chicken wings mild , medium , or hot . If you found that , say , people who order their wings mild have four times more colds per winter than those who order hot , the results might be criticized as what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but it would still be a shot in the arm for the six-plus crowd . We 'd have a celebratory banquet  --  oysters , with hot sauce .  | November 15 , 1993 We did n't do Halloween this year . Oh , sure , I got out my ax murderer 's mask , in case I wanted to march in the parade that 's traditional in our neighborhood . But we did n't have our usual post-parade party . We did n't hang a witch pinata out of the window . When a friend of mine who lives in another city asked why , I offered a simple answer : " We plumb ran out of kids . " The friend  --  I ' 11 call him Horace  --  knew what I was talking about . He has run out of kids himself , and his neighborhood does n't even have a Halloween parade that can accommodate unaccompanied grownups . A couple of years ago he suggested to his youngest daughter that it might be nice to celebrate Halloween the way they had done in the past , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law students to go trick-or-treating . " That 's what it 's like here , too , " I said to Horace . I told him about how we had to give up our Easter egg hunt several years back . " But you must have held that Easter egg hunt for fifteen years ! " Horace said . It 's true that when our kids got too old to search for Easter eggs themselves , we managed to extend the hunt a few years by having them serve as sort of guides and p 217 bearers for some of the younger kids on the block . Finally , though , we had to call a halt . " Why ? " Horace asked . " What happened ? " " Same as Halloween , " I said . " We plumb ran out of kids . " When Horace 's kids were small , he 's told me , he loved taking them around the neighborhood to trick-ortreat . He enjoyed the opportunity to have a little chat with neighbors he sometimes did n't see from one year to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child had chosen as a costume  --  a witch , a Mars bar , Big Bird ? and , Horace admitted to me , he rather liked getting into his own costume . He was a pirate captain . He approached each house shouting , " Avast , ye hearties ! " If his gang ran across people who offered apples or granola or wholegrain sugarless biscuits or anything other than the disgusting teeth-rotters that Horace thought proper for Halloween , he threatened to run them through . All that is over now . On October 31 , Horace and his wife sit home recalling ghosts of Halloweens past . Even the occasional visit of trick-or-treaters does n't do much to cheer them up . Horace likes to see the neighborhood kids in their Halloween costumes , but he finds himself so envious of the accompanying adults that it 's difficult to muster much cheerfulness . A year ago his wife persuaded him that he might feel better if he wore his old pirate captain costume when he opened the door to trick-or-treaters , but a little boy in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a snaggle-toothed monster  --  burst into tears at the sight of him . Now Horace wears his cardigan ? which he was hoping would make him feel like Mr. Rogers but somehow makes him feel more like Mr. Wilson , the grump who lives next door to Dennis the Menace .  | Horace and I agree about what 's causing the problem for both of us and a lot of our contemporaries . Not long after you run out of your own kids to take trick-or-treating  --  or to the zoo or the ballgame or fishing  --  you 're supposed to have grandchildren to take their place . There are no grandchildren in sight . When you read about the effects of changing marriage and childbearing patterns in this country  --  women waiting until after their careers have taken hold before they get married , for instance , or couples living together for years before making it official and having kids  --  what you do n't read about is that this is causing what can only be called a grandchildren gap . This is why Horace spent this past Halloween @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He understands that . He understands that twenty years ago someone the age of his youngest daughter would probably have been the mother of two rather than an assistant district attorney . Horace wants his daughter to do whatever makes her happy . He 's proud of her . He has every reason to believe that she is a terrific assistant district attorney . On the other hand , he misses his pirate captain costume .  | November 22 , 1993 There was once a man named Arthur Robinson who was , as they say , very hard to shop for . He was a nice man , but as the Christmas shopping season began every year , his family and close friends and business associates grew to resent him . Arthur Robinson had no hobbies . He did not grill chicken in the back yard or bake bread , so the problem of what to give him for Christmas could not be solved with a new piece of kitchen equipment or an apron with witty sayings on it . He had no interest in either one of the big Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercising on a stationary bicycle that was already equipped with a reading stand and a lamp and a radio that had earphones . Arthur Robinson dressed conservatively , but he was particular about his clothing . For years he had purchased one sort of shirt and one sort of necktie from the same store , and it was obvious that he had plenty of both . One of his nieces had once commented that giving Uncle Arthur a different sort of necktie for Christmas would be like giving Margaret Thatcher a pair of jogging shorts . He was not known as a fan of any particular kind of music or any particular kind of book . He despised gadgets of every sort . He did not collect anything . He did not smoke a pipe .  | " Are you sure he does n't smoke a pipe ? " one of his nephews asked his older daughter in mid-December one year . " I thought I remembered seeing Uncle Arthur smoke a pipe . " " No . No pipes . " " Maybe I could give him a pipe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the nephew said . " You 're getting desperate , " Arthur Robinson 's daughter said . She got desperate every year herself . " You know , Pop , you 're very hard to shop for , " she would say to her father every year . " Oh , do n't trouble about me , " he 'd say . " I have everything I need . " She knew that he meant it , which made her resent him all the more . She often said to her sister and brother that their father was a wonderful person to have as a father until just past Thanksgiving . Other people who were close to Arthur Robinson felt the same way . When he ran into them during the Christmas shopping season and gave them his usual cheerful hello , they often seemed put out with him . Also , the huge extended-family Christmas dinner that the Robinsons traditionally had was always dampened a bit when it came time for Arthur Robinson to open the gifts brought by the guests . " Well , thank you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box of gray notepaper with his initials on it , although everyone in the room knew that he had a thirty-year supply of the offwhite notepaper he had always preferred . Then in October one year , Arthur Robinson made his first business trip to Africa . Having found himself about to return home with some local currency that was notoriously difficult to change in the United States , he plunked it down at the airport gift shop for the first items p 221 that caught his eye  --  two small statues of elephants . Since his business was conducted in a city , they were the only animals he had seen in Africa . They had both been made in Taiwan . That Christmas , all of his children gave him elephant statues for Christmas . He could n't imagine why , until he realized that he had put the elephants from Africa on a table in his study . He thanked his children politely , as he had always thanked them for the other gifts that he had no earthly use for . The year after that , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , in addition to Merry Christmas , " For your collection . " Arthur Robinson did n't think he had a collection of elephant statues . He considered asking his wife to distribute that information to his children and friends and relatives . His wife , though , was one of the people who had given him an elephant statue , and he did n't want to hurt her feelings . So Arthur Robinson continued to thank everyone for the elephant statues  --  twenty-three by the fourth Christmas following that business trip to Africa . His family and friends had been greatly pleased to find something to get him for Christmas . " At least Arthur 's no problem , " they 'd say as they went down their lists . " Good old Arthur and his dreadful little elephants . " Which meant that when they ran into Arthur during Christmas shopping season , they no longer seemed put out with him . They gave him a cheerful hello . He was always polite , but he resented them deeply .  | December 13 , 1993 From what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is brewing out in the Pacific because Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating referred to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as a " recalcitrant " for not attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting in Seattle . The remark has been denounced by Prime Minister Mohamad as " this condemnation , this vilification of my person . " My first response to this brouhaha was to comment at the breakfast table that if Prime Minister Mohamad gets that worked up about being called a recalcitrant , he is fortunate indeed that he does n't live in our neighborhood . I 've heard people called a lot worse than that just for not moving along quickly enough in the subway-token line . In fact , in our neighborhood , the word " recalci-trant " ? which , according to my dictionary , means hard to handle or deal with  --  would not even qualify as an insult , let alone a vilification . I live in lower Manhattan ; anyone who was n't hard to handle or deal with moved away a long time ago . Calling one of my neighbors recalcitrant would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you 'd done it , the person you meant to insult would still be standing there waiting for you to get to the bad part . p 223 Of course , there are n't any prime ministers in our neighborhood . The closest we come to anybody of that rank , I think , is an older gentleman who is known to some of his neighbors as the Mayor of West Eleventh Street ? a title he holds not because he has ever run for office but because he spends a lot of time sitting on the stoop in front of his building chatting with the passersby . From what I 'm told , the Mayor is a friendly sort who draws few insults , except from people he has chastised for failing to curb their dogs . Even if we had someone of prime ministerial rank in the neighborhood , though , I doubt that he 'd get terribly excited about being called recalcitrant . Heads of government get called that sort of thing all the time . If Charles de Gaulle got angry every time he was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to as the Big Asparagus  --  he would have been on a slow boil for decades . For people in my neighborhood who read about Prime Minister Mohamad 's response to being called recalcitrant , there is a natural tendency to believe that he might be just a little bit touchy  --  like the man down the street who got all hot and bothered just because the newsdealer on Seventh Avenue whom he had asked for change for a quarter responded by calling him a fascist . ( I believe the gentleman in question now lives in Rye . The newsdealer is still on Seventh Avenue , and getting testier . ) This interpretation of personal touchiness is undercut , though , by the fact that the entire government of Malaysia seems to be up in arms about the prime min-ister 's having been called a recalcitrant . In the New York Times account of the wrangle , the Malaysian foreign minister , Abdullah Ahmad Badawi , is quoted as saying that Prime Minister Keating 's remarks went " beyond extreme . "  | The Malaysian government is riled enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proper apology from Prime Minister Keating , Malaysia might reduce its diplomatic relations with Australia and start a boycott of Australian goods  --  no small matter , since Malaysia represents a hefty market that has been increasing its Australian imports at the rate of fourteen percent a year . According to the Times , in fact , " Diplomats from other Asian governments are quietly lining up behind Dr. Mahathir , saying that Mr. Keating 's remarks were unnecessarily rude and showed that Australia 's leaders , used to name-calling in their domestic politics , are still not ready to operate among the nonconfrontational societies of Asia . " The problem , then , is cultural . I had n't thought of Asian societies as nonconfrontational  --  Pearl Harbor comes to mind as an example to the contrary  --  but according to an Asian diplomat quoted in the Times , " In this part of the world , attacks can not be personal . " If all this is cultural , that explains why people in our neighborhood find Prime Minister Mohamad 's anger puzzling . As far as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Someday , though , we 'll probably have a few ? one of the things I like about my neighborhood is that everyone is welcome  --  and now I know not to be personally confrontational with them . If a Malaysian is dawdling in the subway-token line , I 'll say , without looking at anyone , " Since some people here are concerned about being late for work , it might be better for all if this line moved more rapidly . " Also , I 'd suggest that they avoid the newsdealer on Seventh Avenue .  | December 20 , 1993 Could it be that about a year ago , under the impression that I was writing about something else , I predicted the appointment of the White House 's new deputy chief of staff ? It 's possible . One of the dismal truths of political life in this country is that the people who gravitate to Washington are so predictable that a commentator on the events of the day often finds himself accidentally clairvoyant . This relentless predictability accounts for the resilience of the American political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago I wrote about Renaissance Weekend , the annual strivers ' convention on Hilton Head Island which the Clintons always attend . I mentioned what Renaissance Weekend types call networking , which , I explained , is more or less what your Uncle Harry ( the one who represented several lines of leather goods and was so particular about the shine on his shoes ) used to describe as making contacts , except that panel discussions are added . In other words , despite the fact that these people can go on about The Challenges That Face Our Society until you want to run shrieking from the room , they are basically believers in your Uncle Harry 's favorite dictum : " It 's not what you know , it 's who you know . " The organizer of Renaissance Weekend , Philip  | Lader , was described in press reports as a " major-league networker . " But I pointed out that all his networking had landed him only the presidency of what was described as " the only private university in Australia . " That description ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something , and a few months later I finally remembered what it was . Years ago , we used to refer to Linardi 's Laundromat " as the only alliterative Italian laundromat in the West Village . " It was a distinction that did n't have much effect on how the towels were done . Although I took Philip Lader 's position as an indication that there were limits to what even major-league networking could accomplish , I ended the column by saying , " On the other hand , Bill Clinton  --  who has been networking at least since high school in Hot Springs  --  was recently elected president of the United States . And Phil Lader knows Bill Clinton . " As a student of French might say if he had the advantage of having attended a private university below the equator , voila ! Just about a year after I wrote that column , the White House announced that the new deputy chief of staff would be Philip Lader . At the same moment I learned that he had n't been spending the previous year as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already been given one government job , at the Office of Management and Budget . I could n't help wondering whether we taxpayers had to bear the cost of having his Rolodex shipped back from Australia . And what created the hole in the White House staff that Lader was brought in to fill ? The deputy chief of staff and the head of the congressional liaison office ? two powerful aides of a president who had promised to end the revolving door that allowed people to move  | " from public service to private enrichment " ? had left to take cushy jobs as chief executive officers of organizations that lobby the government . Not surprisingly , the phrase " Here they go again " was heard in the land . Unfairly , said the White House . The Clinton Admin-istration 's rules on these matters prevent someone from lobbying the agency he just left , but not from becoming the boss of the people who lobby the agency he just left . Claiming that the administration established rules that are stricter than anything that existed in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old adage that no good deed goes unpunished . " One of the most predictable things about White House aides who have suddenly become famous , aside from the fact that they tend to start dating movie stars , is that they love to hear themselves utter sound bites that turn out to be just a bit off the point . The adage that actually applies in this case is the Washington version of the one Stephanopoulos mentioned : " No good deed goes without a loophole . " The same commentators who criticized the use of the loophole also criticized the appointment of Lader on the grounds that he has little experience in Washington and none in national politics . They 're assuming that someone is appointed to such a position because of what he knows . They did n't listen carefully enough to Uncle Harry .  | January 1o , 1994 This was toward the end of a long bout of what I 'd finally diagnosed as the 192-hour flu . My wife was on her first day of jury duty , and I had been housebound alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not a lot had happened . I think I can honestly say the most exciting thing that had happened all day was a wrong number . The caller was somebody who had been trying to dial his veterinarian , to talk about this skin condition his cat had developed around the paws . We chatted about it for a while . His cat 's name is Elvira . She does n't seem particularly aware of the skin condition , but her owner finds it worrisome anyway . I 'm not ordinarily interested in either cats or skin conditions , but it was a break in the day . About five , I heard my wife 's key in the door . I was going to get a report from the outside world  --  the most exciting turn of events since the skin-condition call . My expectations were modest . I was hoping maybe she had run into a friend and collected a little gossip or that there had been an interesting argument in the subway or that a citizen who slipped on the ice had been righted by an alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that she had actually been selected for a criminal jury and was already beginning to hear a case . " Tell me  | all about it , " I said . " I want to hear every detail  --  the charge , the look on the alleged malefactor 's face , the obvious holes in the opening statements . I want to know about the sighs from your fellow jurors showing disbelief at something the prosecutor or the defense attorney said . I 'm interested in where you see tension developing in the jury room when the time for deliberation comes . If you see yourself in the Henry Fonda role  --  gradually , through quiet logic , bringing the jury around to acquit this innocent lad  --  do n't be afraid to say so . Spare me nothing .

Finally I said , " I would be willing to tell you everything that happened on C-Span today . I 'm talking about the juicy parts , now . I 'm talking about the total story on the Banking Committee 's hearings on long-term debentures . The works . " " I appreciate the offer , " she said , " but I think you told me about that yesterday . It sticks in my mind because I remember that the part about long-term debentures went on pretty long .

Nothing offered 192 hours of relief . " Did we discuss cold-remedy commercials yester-day ? " I asked as dinner was being prepared . " Yes , we did , " she said . " I remember thinking when we went to sleep that I was about to get eight hours of relief from discussing cold-remedy commercials .

"  | January 24 , 1994 A day or two after the Webers ' son  --  Jeffrey , aged twenty-six  --  finally moved out of the house , they realized that they had lost the ability to tape . I heard about this from my friend Horace , who seems to specialize in stories about our contemporaries  --  people who are in that awkward phase between the end of paying tuition and the beginning of playing with grandchildren . Very few of those people are much good with a VCR . Until Bennett and Linda Weber discovered the effect Jeffrey 's move had on their taping operation , Horace told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't that they were n't fond of Jeffrey , who had always been a bright and sweet-tempered boy . It was simply that , as Linda Weber put it , " if Jeffrey 's going to find himself , it would probably help to look somewhere other than his own room . Jeffrey , who sometimes worked as a technician for avant-garde theater productions , had moved into a cheap railroad flat found by his college friend Jason , who was clerking at a record store as a way of supporting himself while he carried on what he referred to as his true life 's work  --  trying to decide whether to go on to graduate school . Helen , the third roommate , was working as a waitress while she took acting lessons , although she made it  | clear that the object of the lessons was never a career in the theater . Since not just Jeffrey but all three roommates were sometimes described as trying to find themselves , Bennett Weber referred to them collectively as The Lost Patrol , the name of his favorite old Victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was about to copy off one of the cable channels until he realized that Jeffrey was the only person in the family who knew how to tape from the excruciatingly complicated cable box . " I had a lot of sympathy with his predicament , " Horace said . " I do n't know if you 've ever tried taping off one of those cable boxes without a kid around , but it 's no joke . The other night I figured I 'd tape Charade , with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn , and I found myself trying to hold three different remote-control gizmos , plus the instructions . I finally put everything down and called my daughter in Phoenix . " I counted my blessings : I have a daughter who lives just around the corner . " So what did Weber do ? " I asked . " He called Jeffrey , of course , who said something like , How do you expect to grow up to be an independent human being if you ca n't even get along without your son for three days ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennett can understand , and took them over there . Jeffrey 's O.K. I would n't call him highly motivated , but he 's O.K. " " If he has an extra copy of those instructions , I would n't mind seeing it , " I said . " Just out of curiosity . " " The next time Bennett called Jeffrey , " Horace continued , " Jeffrey said , What happened , Pop ? You lose the instructions and now there 's a Lawrence Welk retrospective you want to save for posterity ? ' The kid 's clever . Anyway , that was n't the problem at all . The problem was that the Webers ' answering machine got unplugged , and p 233 Bennett did n't know how to reset the access mech-anism . " " I think there 's a little thing in the back , " I mumbled . " The last time that happened to ours , my daughter happened to be home using the washer-dryer , so naturally ... " " So Jeffrey went right over and reset the access mechanism , " Bennett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed Bennett how to set the alarm on his digital watch , which had gone off right in the middle of the best action scene of The Lost Patrol . Bennett can now do it himself perfectly . " " It sounds like Jeffrey may have a gift for helping pre-microchip people survive , " I said . " Exactly what Bennett and Linda thought , " Horace said . " And out of that came Jeffrey 's company  --  TechnoKlutz Ltd . He does an in-home course on how to work your machines . Most of his customers are people whose kids have just moved out . He 's doing so well he might franchise . " " The Webers must be proud of him , " I said . " They are , " Horace said . " In fact , Linda told him that a big executive like him should n't be living in a crummy railroad flat . She 's hoping that he 'll move back home . "  | Just like that . Gone . Vaporized . The next Sunday it was if they had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks out of town might have assumed , as he leafed through the trendy new Styles section looking for tips on how to acquire the mannerisms of an in-theknow teenager , that the authors of three columns ? Stamps , Coins , Camera  --  had fallen ill at once , struck down by some odd virus that affects only obsessive hobbyists . According to an accompanying notice , Chess and Bridge will continue to appear on certain weekdays but are no longer part of the Sunday paper . Apparently , the back pages of the Styles section will now be given over completely to weddings . It 's as if those hip kids who run the weekly Friday Night Sock Hop had persuaded the principal that permitting the wonks of the Chess Team and the Stamp Club to hang around for meetings on the same evening just ruins everybody 's fun . As it happens , I have no interest in stamps , coins ,  | cameras , chess , or bridge . My only hobby is reading the wedding announcements in the Sunday Times . Over the years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small distinctions in the backgrounds of the bride and groom that stamp collectors make in various Luxembourg commemoratives . I know the pecking orders of schools and suburbs ; I know which debutante parties can be bought into and which are authentically snotty ; I know where the fissures run between and within ethnic groups . I long ago acknowledged the source of my interest : I enjoy contemplating the sort of tensions that are likely to come out at the reception . You think that 's a meanspirited basis for a hobby ? There are coin collectors whose motives are not so pure either . Given my own interests , you might think the Times announcement would cause me to celebrate  --  to treat myself to some champagne and the sort of hors d'oeuvres one might find at the wedding of a Greek-American Columbia Law School graduate from Ozone Park to an intern whose B.A. is from Yeshiva . That might have been my response , in fact , if it had n't been for my childhood friend Herbert . For many years Herbert has read the Sunday Times almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras . I say almost because if he had a little extra time on his hands , it was his custom to peruse the chess and bridge columns as well . " Chess is still going to be in the paper on Tuesdays , " I said to Herbert when I reached him on the telephone shortly after I read the announcement . " You 'll be able to catch the bridge column five days a week  --  just not on Sunday . " " Thanks , " Herbert said , without enthusiasm . " It 's nice of you to say so . " " Herbert , " I said , " you ca n't take this personally . It 's  | not as if the editors of the Times got together and decided that there 's a certain sort of reader they do n't want to have around on Sundays . " I felt I had to say that because , frankly , Herbert has always had a little problem in the self-esteem department . Some of his friends think it dates right back to the time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move their meetings to Thursday nights for some trumped-up reason that everybody knew was a cover for the distaste of the Sock Hop crowd . Herbert was recording secretary of the Stamp Club that year . " I guess there 's no chance of my letter getting in now , " Herbert said , referring to a letter he 'd written to the stamps column about a Nicaraguan airmail stamp he passionately felt was underappreciated . " Maybe the chess column would run it on a slow Tuesday , " I said , grasping at straws . " No , it 's gone , " Herbert said . He 's right , of course . On Sunday mornings now , I can picture Herbert in his favorite armchair . The Styles section , featuring a front-page piece on whether the fashion of wearing navel rings has played itself out , lies unread at his feet . He 's staring out into space . Given that picture in my mind , it 's difficult for me to conjure up wedding receptions .

" If Winston Churchill , who was even more eloquent than Jack Valenti , were still on the scene to toss around a phrase he made famous during the Second World War ? " soft underbelly , " as in attacking the Axis powers in their soft underbelly  --  he might have by now referred to the office copying machine as the soft underbelly of Washington power . As it turns out , of course , modern technology has given Washington more than one soft underbelly . On the table next to the copier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that are the dictating machine and the tape recorder  --  those newfangled instruments that American political figures , to their ultimate sorrow , can never seem to get the hang of . The modern office machinery for disseminating or destroying information provides what someone of Churchillian inclination might call a two-edged sword : its power is awesome , but its operation usually requires a potential witness . For those of us who often find our-  | selves baffled by technology , one of the most poignant scenes conjured up by the Watergate investigation was a vision of what Richard M. Nixon , a man who had always left hand-eye coordination to others , would have looked like trying to erase eighteen and a half minutes of taperecording on his own . Ask Senator Robert Packwood , that unfortunate gold medalist in the one-man lunge , about the perils of employing people to operate such instruments .

Through the testimony of someone described as an aide to the senator  --  someone accustomed to working such machines as tape recorders and word processors . Of course , if Senator Packwood had recorded his innermost thoughts in the manner of a United States senator of , say , the early eighteenth century  --  spending solitary evenings next to a dim oil lamp , scratching with a quill pen on foolscap  --  he would never have been able to amass what he himself has estimated as 8,500 singlespaced pages . On the other hand , the entire diary could have been disposed of during a quiet evening in front of the fireplace , with no one the wiser . I have to say that after listening to Senator Packwood being interviewed by Barbara Walters on " 20/20 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate p 239 Ethics Committee who have to go through 8,500 pages of his innermost thoughts , but that 's beside the point . The evidence is voluminous and potentially devastating . You could say that Senator Packwood has been hoisted by his own petard , except that it 's difficult to see how something as palpably undigitalized as a petard would be available in a United States senator 's office . The verdict is still out on whether the shredder will prove to be for Oliver North the soft underbelly that all marines are philosophically committed not to acquire . North and Fawn Hall , the Vanna White of office machinery , shredded a lot of evidence as agents closed in on the Reagan Administration 's arms-for-hostages caper  --  an arrangement that , I suspect , is still referred to fondly in Iran by a Farsi phrase that translates roughly as " the time we snookered the yahoos . " North , though , says he 's proud to have shredded the evidence  --  so proud that you 'd think that the agents closing in on him were from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the FBI , which sort of spoils the story . The voters of Virginia will eventually decide whether North emerged unscathed from his brush with office machinery . It seems clear that even if Packwood manages to last out his term , his days of winning elections are over . Nixon 's herculean efforts to rehabilitate himself are tripped up regularly by a new release of transcripts from that infernal machine . And Jack Valenti ? He has thrived as the mouthpiece for the motion picture industry . I can picture him now ? a natty man working in a vast and impressive office . He is standing at a Xerox machine .  | March 14 , 1994 If I 'm watching a movie and something happens in the movie that could never happen in real life , I may express some irritation . This probably does n't come as a complete surprise to you . Some years ago , after all , I acknowledged that I have been known to shout at the television set when something happens in a television drama that would never happen in real life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had threatened to banish me to another room during " L.A. Law , " which we used to watch on the bedroom television set , if I did n't quit leaping to my feet during implausible courtroom scenes and shouting , " Objection , your honor ! " " I thought we decided that you were n't going to stand on the bed to make objections during L.A. Law , ' " my wife would say . " But that lawyer is not allowed to do that in cross-examination , " I 'd say . " No judge would allow him to do that . " " It does n't make any difference , " my wife would say . " Nobody cares about that sort of thing . " " I care , " I would say . " I care deeply . " If you remembered that I tend to shout at the television set during moments of blatant impossibility , the only question you might have had about my response to  | movies was whether it is less demonstrative , considering the fact that a movie theater is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one , too : no . I hate it when characters in movies behave in a way they would n't really behave ; I 'm constantly on guard for inaccuracies and anachronisms . I 'm the guy in the movie theater who 's always saying things like " That word was n't used in 1942 " or " No police detective would ever do that . " My wife is the person next to me saying " Shhhh . " When some truly unbelievable plot turn is being set up or when someone is being rendered unconscious but unbruised by a friendly right to the jaw ( " I 'm sorry to have to do this , " the puncher says just before the punch ) or when someone is driving a car at eighty miles an hour over cornfields , I 'm the one in the theater you hear emitting a loud sigh . Actually , it 's a loud sigh if I happen to be on my best behavior . More often , it 's a mumbled " Gim me a break " or even a clearly audible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife and I went to see it at our neighborhood movie house . Although Philadelphia is an admirable attempt to discuss the AIDS epidemic through the personal story of one human being , a young corporate lawyer in Philadelphia , its courtroom scenes make the courtroom scenes in " L.A. Law " look like a demonstration workshop sponsored by the American Bar Association 's committee on litigation techniques . After a while , every time the movie got back to the courtroom I would be asked by the people behind me to sit down : I had been halfway to my feet , prepared to object . I always resumed my seat with a quick but polite apology . I did not turn to explain that a lawyer who is examining a witness is not permitted to make speeches rather than ask questions . That 's right : I do everything I can to prevent these incidents from turning nasty . Nobody likes having a flashlight shined in his eyes  | by some officious usher who is saying , " Sir , I 'll have to ask you to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I always resist the temptation to reply , " I 'll have to ask you to show films that do not depict people driving automobiles in a manner that defies the laws of physics . " Most important , I try to avoid the incidents in the first place by not going to movies that I know are going to bring me to my feet on a regular basis . For instance , I do n't go to movies featuring any character who is in the wrong body or the wrong century or the wrong solar system . That 's right . If a character in a movie I 'm expected to watch dies , he is required to remain dead . He is n't allowed to come back as an invisible spirit so he can look after his wife and kids when they 're in danger . He ca n't remain frozen for thirty or forty years and then get thawed out accidentally by some oversized microwave . He is n't permitted to wander off to some other century or return to earth as a golden retriever . Dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to change bodies . Everyone is required to end the movie in the same body he came in in . Members of the audience are not allowed to be in the movie . Ghosts are out , also angels . I know that eliminates a few distinguished movies  --  It 's a Wonderful Life , for instance  --  but a rule 's a rule .  | March 21 , 1994 A devotion to Gunga Din is an awkward thing to bring to a marriage . This has been particularly true since some Americans began to take movies seriously  --  I put the date of that sometime in the spring of 1956 ? and your favorite movie became less like your favorite ice cream flavor than like a test of your character . When my wife and I got married , in 1965 , I would n't have been surprised to hear that her friends were speculating about how long she 'd be able to remain in a union with somebody who was filmicly stunted . My father brought me up to believe that Gunga Din was the greatest movie ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons to seek revenge for the Battle of the Boyne . To this day I 'm enthralled by the roistering sergeants , Cary Grant and Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks , Jr . I laugh out loud every time I see my fath-er 's favorite scene : During a brawl , Cary Grant is about to slug a man he is holding halfway out a second-story window . A nonroistering sergeant on the street shouts up , " Take your hands off that man ! " Grant , obeying orders for once , removes his hands and lets the man fall to the street below . It seemed natural that shortly after I met the woman who was going to become my wife , I insisted that she watch Gunga Din with me . It was n't a test . It was n't as  | if I planned to give her a quiz at the end , like the football quiz in Diner . By chance , Gunga Din was showing on late-night TV , and I was sure she 'd enjoy it . I 'll admit that I harbored some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years to come  --  laughing at Cary Grant 's mugging and McLaglen 's sputtering , sharing a shudder at the creepy leader of the murder cult . My wife did n't seem terribly impressed by Gunga Din . She said that she did n't understand what distinguished it from Four Feathers and The Lost Patrol and other examples of a genre she referred to as " sand movies . " I thought about explaining how Gunga Din did n't have anything to do with movies like The Lost Patrol , and not just because it takes place in India , where there 's no sand to speak of . But somehow I knew it would n't do any good . She would never see Gunga Din the way my father did . If we got married , it would be a marriage that did not provide me with a Gunga Din companion . My father had told me that Gunga Din was the greatest movie ever made , but he 'd also told me that someday I 'd probably meet a girl I 'd be willing to give something up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before differences in movie tastes could be papered over with videocassettes . I now have my own tape of Gunga Din . The other day I was watching it when my wife , who was in another room , heard me laugh out loud . " What are you doing ? " she said . " Watching Gunga Din , " I said . " Is it supposed to be funny ? " Just for a moment , I thought about telling her that Gunga Din was usually a lot better than it had been that night she saw it many years ago . I remember that print as looking jumpy and dark and  --  yes , I 'll admit it  --  sandy . Also , the commercials came at awkward moments  --  for p 245 instance , right in the middle of the hilarious scene in which Cary Grant , hoping to stage a diversion so that Gunga Din can slip away to alert the regiment , emerges from where the two of them had been hiding in the murder-cult temple , strolls down the center aisle singing " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roast beef , " and then announces to the horde of murdercultists surrounding him that they 're all under arrest . I thought about telling her that any movie can have an off night . But I did n't think my wife had really built up sympathy over the years for the scene in which Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. , whose term of enlistment is up , rejects the pleas of his fiancee in order to join Victor McLaglen in a two-man attempt to rescue Cary Grant from thousands of murder-cultists  --  leaving his fiancee to say , in a moment that blends exasperation with insight , " You 'd rather be with him . " Also , my wife has always been understanding about my devotion to Gunga Din ; she treats it the way she treats my lingering fondness for certain leftovers that my mother served me when I was a boy . You might say I have a Gunga Din easement . All in all , things have worked out . " Yes , some of it is funny , " I finally said . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | She 's never been in Antonia 's house later than seven at night , never been here alone at all . The majestic old brownstone has a disdainful air about it , as though her presence is an intrusion , and she finds herself sitting on the edges of chairs or walking gingerly on the wood floors to avoid disturbing anything . The living room is spacious , calm , except for the city noises that assault her  --  ambulance sirens , screeching tires , a car alarm braying an unearthly combination of hoots , whines , and shrieks . All that urgent activity  --  so unlike the deep night silence of Taconic Hills , so deep she used to feel she 'd become immune to gravity and had floated into starry space . Valerie slips off her shoes and sinks back on the sofa , numb and weary , on the edge of sleep . But as soon as she closes her eyes Esther and Joanna appear , laughing , splashing in the bathtub or sitting on a bench in the park overlooking the playground . Sleep might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hang beside the tall windows , she watches a snub-nosed Porsche roll down the street , its roof dappled with the shadows of new leaves , a trickle of moonlight slicking all the surfaces . Perhaps the driver has seen Joanna on some deserted street while he was waiting for a light to change .  | Surrounded by Antonia 's angels , stone and wood and watercolor renderings of seraphim in flight , she offers herself in trade to the powers that control Joanna 's fate . She 's got to find her own lost angel , but some benevolent , invisible force wo n't take her hand and spirit her to Joanna 's side . And she wo n't wait around for Russo and Gallagher , ca n't sit by while some journalist wings his way across the continent . So , what can she do , shake Martha and Lucas until they confess ? There 'll be the devil to pay if she thinks only of her own satisfaction , her own fury vented . She 'll come up with an idea . She has to . Eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown Icarus drawn to the sun 's reflection in the living-room window , flies so near the glass she 's sure it will crash . But at the last second it veers away and arcs toward Grand Army Plaza . Pink sky turns to red ; a swath of brilliant orange stacks along the horizon , and with each bold layer her resolve strengthens . She 'll go upstairs , to the small bedroom at the end of the hall , Kristin Denby 's old room . She 'll write everything down , as she does when she 's starting a paper for school , and maybe then she 'll discover something she 's missed , even if it means putting words to things she 'd rather shove into tiny boxes with tight lids . She 's always thought of Kristin 's small bedroom as a haven  --  soft colors , tiny yellow flowers on the wallpaper , patterned curtains draping the canopy bed like a cloud , even wood shutters on the windows to close the rest of the world out . The desk lamp casts a consoling light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she writes Joanna 's name on a sheet of paper , looks away from the page , white and black and stark , like the rooms in which Antonia lives . Valerie scans the bookshelves near the doorway for inspiration , a starting place . Tapes of Vivaldi , Bach , Schumann ; nineteenth-century British novels ; two leatherbound volumes of A Thousand Nights and a Night . Nothing triggers a thought . Instead of solutions or even facts , a jumble of questions fills her head . Does Joanna think she 's been abandoned ? Did Elizabeth Proctor understand or care where it all began when the Salem hangman slipped the noose over her head ?  | How long did it take Martha and Lucas to plan their Halloween charade ? How many others were in on it ? Would it have mattered to Rebecca Nurse to know that she 'd be remembered in history books three hundred years later ? Every part of her feels pummeled . She ca n't keep the demons away and she can no longer fight the sleep she so desperately needs . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffled conversation drifts up the stairs . Martha and Lucas ? Mitch Russo ? She 's suffocating behind the canopy curtains ; they 're heavier than they look , and she struggles to push them aside . The pale green quilt holds the impression of her body , as though her ghost is trapped atop the down comforter , but she 's free , standing on the cold floor in her bare feet . The clock on the wicker dressing table says seven forty-six . She 's been asleep for an hour . And then she hears Antonia 's muted voice , and Valerie remembers : this is Kristin 's room , she 's in Antonia 's house , and no one has called to say they found Joanna . " Oh , you 're awake . " Nadia , Antonia 's housekeeper , stands in the doorway , one hand smoothing the coil of hair pinned atop her head . " You been sleeping so deep you did n't hear us come in . Mrs. Carrera asked me to tell you that breakfast will be ready in half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm not hungry , but please tell Mrs. Carrera I 'll join her for coffee . Thanks , Nadia . " The woman lingers in the doorway , her broad face flattened out by the light . " An egg , maybe , or a piece of bread , even , something . You need your strength , miss . " Shaking her head and muttering , Nadia trundles toward the stairs . What she really needs is a shower and a cup of coffee . What she really needs is her daughter , sitting in the spray of sunlight that brightens the center of the rug . The white-tiled bathroom beside Kristin Denby 's old room , unused for months , still smells of almond soap . Valerie shucks her underclothes , runs the hot water until the mirror fogs , steps into the shower and begins to lather her body . When her hands touch her p 53 belly , she has to press hard to keep the pain away , as though Joanna has just been torn from her . Better not to stand here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the white cotton shirt and the print skirt she wore the day before . Joanna will recognize them , will be comforted by their familiarity . Before she heads to the dining room , she calls Russo , demands to know what he 's learned in the past eight hours . Russo is apologetic . No report from the medical examiner , not for a few days , and there 's no point planning a funeral until the body is officially re-leased . Nothing substantial from the Columbia County sheriff 's department . Yes , a deputy went out to the Starrs ' house , looked around , checked their alibi and contacted a dark-haired woman named Ann Phelps who had recently joined their church . No , although they seemed edgy , had tried to stall him , the deputy saw nothing , heard nothing at Johnny 's parents ' house that would indicate the presence of a child , no size 2 coveralls , no toys , no baby aspirin . Yes , he 's keeping an eye on them and checking further on the Phelps woman but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operative word : nothing . " Valerie . " Antonia sets an uneaten scone on the plate in front of her and dabs her fingers on the napkin in her lap . " Sit here , would you , right beside me . You said you were going to call . " " Sorry . " The churning in her stomach stops when she looks away from the glistening , buttery crumbs on Antonia 's plate . " I did n't get back here until late , I do n't know , maybe two o'clock . I did n't want to wake you and your guests . " Antonia nods . " I spent the whole night wondering what was happening . I thought if I called here the phone might wake the child , so by five I asked Carl and Nadia to bring me back to Brooklyn . Those other people are terribly boring and they wo n't even notice I 'm gone . When do you think your daughter will wake up ? " The question sounds more like an accusation . Or maybe it 's only concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valerie tells  | her about the night before , the story by now reduced to a single , painful line . " Some woman stole my credit cards and Joanna 's health record from Esther 's apartment and got to the police station before I did and they sent Joanna away with her . " " Oh , my dear , how awful . " Antonia 's nostrils flare with indignation , as though someone has violated the laws of nature without consulting her . " How stupid . What are they doing now ? " " The detective in charge , Russo , swears they 've got every available cop working on the case . He wants me to talk to a man named Kevin Murchison . This Murchison is some kind of magazine writer , I think . Russo says he 's done a lot of research , written several articles . About people who 've been wrongly accused of belonging to Satanic cults . " In order to explain why that matters , she has to explain to Antonia about Martha and Lucas and the Halloween threats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to a total stranger , " she says as she brings the story back around to last night 's conversation with Russo . " I hate the idea of some reporter turning my life into material . First of all , I ca n't see how it will help me find Joanna . And it makes me feel , I do n't know  --  exposed . Like I 'm standing in the Taconic Hills post office in my underwear . " " But you have nothing to hide . " Antonia reaches for her scone and breaks off a small piece . " You do n't have any terrible secrets you 're afraid this man will discover , do you ? " Terrible ? Nothing she 'd be afraid to reveal to her daughter when she grows up . " Maybe he 'll find out about the time I was suspended from Pine Plains High School . For putting fliers with quotes and pictures from a Jesse Helms interview about the arts and pornography in certain teachers ' mailboxes . Big deal , so I altered the senator 's picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breasts and a tiny , limp penis . " Antonia laughs appreciatively . " I 'd say that 's something to be proud of . " " Or maybe Murchison will come up with the Copake Lake incident . It was May , my senior year in high school . There were eight of us , drinking , indulging in a little adolescent groping one Friday night , and then somebody said they were starving . So we made ourselves breakfast in the summer house of a famous Newsweek reporter  | who happened to be in Europe at the time . He backed away from pressing charges at the last minute . " It 's been so long , years , really , since she 's thought about those events that she might as well be talking about someone else . There 's been so little time for looking back . " I suppose you 're right , Antonia . If this Murchison is really looking for a story the only thing he 'll find is how I was set up by my inlaws so they could claim I worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why now ? Maybe it 's taken Johnny 's parents all this time to find her  --  to find Joanna . Perhaps they 've been cooking up new evidence to prove that she 's an unfit mother . Except , without her child , can she call herself a mother ? " Valerie , you must n't let yourself imagine the worst . You must have faith , my dear , and you must remember to behave with dignity . You 're young , but you must command their respect . The police will pay much more attention if you 're firm and dignified , I can assure you . " Antonia nods in the direction of the silver service on the polished sideboard . " Let 's have our coffee . " Valerie pours out two cups of the dark brew , drops a single sugar cube and a dollop of milk into Antonia 's cup , sets the cups on the table . The first sip burns its way down her throat . " Of course , you 'll stay here with me . I know you 've refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different situation . And if you need money for anything , anything at all , you shall have it . I 'm happy to do what I can . " Strange how it 's happened , little by little , first in the darkness and now in the steely light of this spring morning . The unthinkable has become real , and it 's drawn Lynn , Kevin Murchison , even Antonia Carrera and her entire household into its orbit . They 're all spinning in great , wobbly rings around a powerful , dark core , the way Tituba drew all of Salem into her orbit when she told conjuring stories to amuse her young charges in 1692 . " Antonia , I am sorry to bring my problems into your life . I really am grateful to have a place to stay . Thanks . " " Do n't be silly . This is your home now , that 's all . " Expertly , Antonia sets her cup in the groove of the saucer . " I 'm not an easy person to live with , Valerie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , whether it 's apples or bed linens or the people in my life . It 's one of the few things over which I have some control . I detest shoddiness , and I abhor things done halfway . " Valerie stiffens : is the woman calling her cheap goods ? But , oblivious , Antonia continues . " So you must n't be too modest to understand that your quick mind , good manners , and generous heart mean a lot to me . I 'm not a selfless person , you know that . I simply do n't want to lose you . When you get your daughter back , you 'll stay on , of course , both of you . " It 's nice that someone has written a happy ending to this nightmare . " Thanks . You 're kind to offer , truly . But when this is all over , Joanna and I will probably go back to Taconic Hills . " Antonia adjusts her dark glasses , which have slipped down her thin nose again . " I may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in no state to make such a decision . We 'll talk about this another time . In any case , if there 's some way I can help you , you must tell me . I have to say , I believe things will work out . Knowing you as I do , I 'm sure you 've passed on to your daughter a certain strength . Even in so young a child , the important things are there already . She 's a sweet-tempered child , am I right ? " Sweet-tempered , yes , she is that . Joanna has put up with all the disruptions in her young life with a smile , apparently unaffected by her father 's absence or her mother 's busy schedule . Sweet-tempered , and something stronger  --  confident , that 's it . " Valerie , my dear , I asked about the child . " Before she can respond , brakes grind and squeal as a garbage truck belches to a stop outside the house . Nine o'clock . She ca n't sit at this white marble table in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Antonia . If she does n't leave soon , she 'll be late for her appointment . " I 'm sorry , Antonia , but I ca n't talk about Joanna right now . I have to go meet that writer . " The disappointment on Antonia 's face is fleeting . " Go ahead , my dear . Take one of the umbrellas in the hall . I 'm sure we 're going to have rain . Do n't worry about me being alone here . Nadia and Carl are staying . You just come and go as you need to . " " Thanks . Thanks for everything . " She squeezes Antonia 's hand p 57 and runs to the foyer , plucks an umbrella from the closet , grabs her purse , and lets herself out . As the door closes behind her , she notices a young man she 's seen before stepping out of a UPS van . " Hey , it ca n't be that bad , " he says as she passes him . It can be that bad . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the naivete of assuming everyone 's life is as uncomplicated as his own .  | Francine rolled over into a shaft of sunlight and groaned . " Nobody 's allowed to set the alarm for so early , not on Saturday . It 's against the law . " She pulled the cover over her head  --  his head too . Johnny Starr wriggled out from the swaddling and swung his feet to the floor . No dry mouth , no aching head  --  that was the first victory , the first real pleasure when he gave up drinking ten months ago , and he continued to marvel at how light and full of energy he felt at the start of each day . " Not so fast , Mr. Starr . " Francine 's hand was already reaching around , touching him , making him hard . " I 'm giving up a whole day of my weekend so you can go to work . That means I 've earned a reward , do n't you think ? " " And what did you have in mind ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head under the covers and kissed the swell of her breast , letting his tongue work easy circles on her sleep-warmed skin . " Mmm , I 'll have to think about it . What are my choices ? " She arched under his touch , ribs rising with the sharp intake of breath as his fingers explored between her legs . " That 's a good option . I love you , Johnny Starr . " Johnny did n't answer . As he lifted himself above her , she grasped the back of his neck . The way Valerie used to . His rhythm was bro- p 59 ken , and he frowned at her face . Delicate mouth , strong nose , dark eyes and hair the color of wet tobacco leaves : she was right . He was attracted to a type . So be it . She was Francine , not Valerie . At least she had n't taken anything away from him . Just the oppo-site . He leaned down to kiss Francine , and the broken spell was mended . He swiped at the steamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he did every morning , how smart he 'd been to let his beard grow so he could save morning shave time . Francine trimmed it once a month . He liked that she did that , enjoyed the intimacy of her grooming him , like some kind of monkey whose existence depended on acquiring survival skills and on attaching itself to a cozy little group . Family . Tribe . Whatever , it meant connection . People could n't live without connections . " You 're already beautiful , " she said , as though his thoughts had created her , her face ghostlike in the mirror , a peppery grin spreading as she held up her hand and pointed to her watch . " Late , but beautiful . " " You my mother now ? " He stuck the comb back on the shelf , turned and kissed her cheek . " Do n't worry , I 'll make it to work on time . " And for his troubles and because it was Saturday , be paid one hundred and twenty dollars for a ten-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your mother ? I have enough to think about without worrying whether you 've brushed your teeth or not , Johnny Starr . Total selfishness , sweetie pie . I have a lot to do around here . " She hooked her arm in his and walked beside him to the kitchen , frowning and shaking her head . " Such a good little hausfrau . Taking care of your family . " He liked using that word , " family , " despite her resistance to marriage . Family , she 'd said the day she moved into his apartment , was much better when you chose it , infinitely stronger when it was your willingness to stay together and not some dumb piece of paper that kept you connected . Johnny accepted the coffee she handed him , drank it down ,  | rinsed the mug , yanked a paper towel from the roll , and swabbed at the puddle on the pitted countertop . His mother had always stood over him , watching , making sure he cleaned up properly . Maybe if she 'd paid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to who he really was , to his dreams and his fears . . . He gritted his teeth . Not this time . That was an old alcohol habit , blaming someone else for things that were his responsibility . He would n't use his parents as an excuse . No more props , just taking care of business . In another few weeks he 'd have the money saved to move them into a larger space with enough room for him to start working on his own paintings again . He 'd see whether he still had it , after all those years of hiding behind the booze and trying to destroy himself because he was n't the person they wanted him to be . He 'd find a new place in a respectable neighborhood , not some broken-down Lower East Side tenement where people waited for New York City to toss them-to the top of the heap and give them another chance or chew them up and spit them out once and for all . Maybe to the young actors and poets who 'd fled the burbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Loisaida anymore . He was done waiting . He was going to make it happen . They were , Francine and him . Buy their own equipment , take out an ad in the Voice or something and get twenty dollars an hour for painting people 's offices and apartments , still a bargain considering how fast he was , how thorough his cleanup . " You gon na pick up some milk on your way home ? " Francine 's breath smelled like the strawberry jam she 'd just spread on her toast . " Jeez , you ca n't work when I 'm around and you ca n't even take a break to walk half a block to the grocery . Okay , you have an excuse today , but I 'm saving up all these chits . You 're gon na owe me , you know . " He kissed her , delighted that he was starting the day in synch with her , with the world . Most of it , anyway . Johnny Starr pulled on his sweatshirt and stuffed his wallet in his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then when he got paid he 'd place that ad . He had n't felt so excited in a long time . Everything was going well , and he was n't afraid of the good feelings anymore . He hummed softly , beating the banister with his hand as he bounded down the two flights of stairs . p 61 No sun again today , but that did n't matter . He did n't need fair weather or someone else 's approval in order to feel good . Although it would be nice to see Mom and Dad , surprised , shocked even , when he told them he was on his feet again , without their help , running his own business , taking care of his family . And he would n't mind seeing Valerie 's reaction to the changes in his life . He skirted around three boys in baggy pants and untied sneakers , huddled together in the middle of the sidewalk . When he got closer , he saw the reason for their whooping laughter , a black and white girlie magazine they were passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plump with childhood , they could n't have been more than nine or ten . Nearby , a group of young women pushed baby strollers and chatted , oblivious to the activity around them . From the corner of his eye he noticed a toddler step off the curb as a battered panel truck screeched around the corner . Before he could shout a warning , one of the mothers raced to the bewildered child and snatched him back onto the sidewalk , yelling and swatting at the child 's behind . If she 'd been paying attention , the kid would never have strayed into harm 's way . Were his mother 's licks and her scolding supposed to teach the little boy how to keep himself safe in a dangerous world ? It did n't have to be like that . Johnny closed his eyes and imagined a green-eyed child in a pink dress , pictured her sitting on his lap as he read to her and explained how the kids in the book looked both ways before crossing the street . There was so much catching up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to learn about her . Did she like peaches , music , dolls ? Joanna . The cold , dark emptiness nearly swallowed him up again , the way it had for the past year whenever he thought about her . The pictures he 'd been making in his head had n't been enough . Not nearly enough .  | Washington and Perry , the western edge of nowhere , tucked away on one of the angled streets that make Greenwich Village a nightmare for the uninitiated to navigate . The man on the corner looks like a turtle , only his head sticking out from a stained , fraying shell of coats and sweaters . He 's declaiming in what sounds like Italian , pointing to the thick clouds that elbow their way past the distant beacon of the Empire State Building . More people talk to themselves in New York City than to their neighbors in Taconic Hills . The building where Kevin Murchison lives squats in the middle of the block . Soot has turned the cut-stone facade the color of cigarette ash but cast-iron scrollwork flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different era . Thick air absorbs the sound of her footsteps like new snow , and she pushes the door open and then looks around to make sure no surprises are lurking in dark corners . When she presses the uP button beside the elevator , gears groan . Apartment 412 . The stairs are broad and well lit , safer and less menacing than being lifted by pulleys in a box that will shudder and squeal and inch its way upward . p 63 In the semidarkness of the third-floor landing she stops to catch her breath . The shadow on the wall looks like a child curled in sleep . Like Joanna with one hand tucked beneath her cheek and the other resting against the yellow dump truck . If she closes her eyes , maybe she 'll be able to see the details of her daughter 's surroundings . But the only picture that comes to her is Joanna , smiling , playing with the truck . She could be anywhere ... anywhere except where she belongs . Valerie takes the last half flight of stairs at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing from the other side of the door . " Hello ? Mr. Murchison ? You said ten o'clock . It 's Valerie Vincent . " " Door 's open . " The voice sounds muffled , faraway . A photo gallery of children 's faces , a framed square of fabric brilliant with peacock colors , and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves cover one wall of a large , sunny room . Assorted clothing is folded neatly in stacked plastic cubes that flank a yellowing shoji screen . Books and papers teeter on an old fruit crate beside the precisely made bed . A conference table that looks as though it 's been liberated from some college library complete with computer , yellow legal pad , more books , sits opposite the Pullman kitchen . The counters are bare . An odd combination of order and energy , of the ordinary and the unusual : not much worldliness here  --  but the geometric neatness does reflect a certain discipline , an intellectual rigor . The person who lives here may really be able to help her find her daughter . Working the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from behind the screen , thick eyebrows bunched above his prominent nose . Tall , stoop-shouldered even when he straightens , he looks like a director of low-budget movies . The brackets at the corners of his mouth and the web of wrinkles around his eyes deepen as he brushes at his corduroy trousers and studies her . " Ah , the lady from Taconic Hills . Who knows you 're here ? " It 's his eyes that give him away , hard and dark as roasted coffee beans and set in a perpetual squint . Let him stare ; all he 'll see now is her resolve . " No one . Look , we do n't really have to do this cloak-and-dagger stuff , do we ? All I want is to get my daughter back . I need to know what I can expect from this DASH organization , what they want . " 64 marilyn Wallace lost angel 65  | He pulls wire-rimmed glasses from his pocket , adjusts the earpiece beneath his close-cropped hair , points her to a chair at the long table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ms. Vincent , I 'm not playing games . I 've known about DASH and their tactics for eight years , and you would n't believe some of the ? " He sighs and folds his hands , fingers twined so tight the knuckles stretch thin and white . " Please , I want to help you . How about extending me a little of your trust ? And I also need a lot of your background . Russo says your former in-laws tried to scare you into giving up your daughter six months ago , is that right ? " He 's not going to do this to her , not going to subvert her question with questions of his own so he can twist things around to suit himself . " You need background so you can write one of your exposes ? I came here at Detective Russo 's urging , but before I tell you anything about myself , I want some information . About DASH . And about you , Mr. Murchison . I 'm not going to turn my life into fodder for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Murchison 's dark eyes . " Self-interest has nothing to do ? " The spark turns to ashes in an instant . He nods and raises his hands . " Fair enough . Here 's the short version . You never heard of DASH before last night , right ? I 'm sure Russo told you that innocuous acronym stands for Deliverance And Safe Haven . DASH boasts of having members in all fifty states . By their own count , three thousand people . Not a lot when you think of this grand nation 's population , but even if it 's only half that , enough of them to make the whole pisspot dangerous . They claim that kids everywhere are being subjected to systematic abuse , ritual Satanic abuse , perpetrated by adults , usually the kid 's own parents or teachers . Adults who  --  so DASH claims  --  have joined Satanic conspiracies that reach into the ranks of schools , cops , public officials , you name it . " Sometimes , all DASH manages to do is destroy reputations , but they 've shattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ res-cued  --  that 's what they call it , rescued  --  at least three kids I know of . When he gestures at the photographs on the wall , she notices a picture in the bottom row . A woman about her own age , her head  | thrown back in laughter , her blond hair streaming behind her , not a child at all . " Those first three kids  --  they 're the ones DASH rescued . Danny , Shavonna , Linda . What they do when they focus all their energies on a kid , and it 's been a very young child each time , is to steal it . Kidnap it . The kid disappears and turns up hundreds of miles away with a new identity . " A surge of excitement thumps at her heart . If that 's what 's happened , then Joanna is alive . And as long as she 's alive , whatever it takes , she will find her . He frowns as though he does n't understand what he 's said to make her smile . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the press . Whenever there 's a lot of publicity , they go deeper , move the child around more . The two cases I know of where the parents made direct pleas through the press . . . " He shakes his head . " It 's taken much longer to find them , thirteen , fourteen months instead of one or two . " Fourteen months . What happens to the mind of a child who 's in a constant state of terror for more than a year , a child torn out of her life for fourteen months ? " Some people think DASH 's real agenda is to cover up their own abusive practices . Personally , I think these jerks need to believe what they 're saying so they can lay blame for family problems anywhere but on their own doorsteps . Which makes it harder to get them to back off . But I 've never , ever heard of them committing murder to get a kid . I do n't know , I ca n't tell if this is an escalation or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he strides to the sink . " Any of this sound relevant ? " he demands . If DASH were a topic she 'd chosen for a history paper , she 'd consider the context , would examine the lives of key individuals from the perspective of social movements , the political , religious , and economic Zeitgeist . But this is Joanna 's life , and she is n't an objective observer . Still , one thing stands out , would to anyone , she 's certain . " I 'd bet my ex-husband 's parents belong to DASH . The narrow-mindedness , the need to shift blame away from themselves  --  it all fits . To Martha and Lucas Starr , I 've always been evil incarnate . I 'm not sure  | why , but they convinced themselves that Johnny went to ruin because I was n't the type to join the Ladies ' Auxiliary or something . " " Ah , the Starr suspects . " He waves away his own remark . " Who are they ? I mean , what do they believe , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She tells him about their disapproval of her mother 's jobs waiting tables or selling shampoo and aspirin . She talks about how Johnny 's parents turned a blind eye on his drinking and then berated her for not letting him heap more and more hostility on her , how they blamed her for the divorce . And finally she tells him again about her All Hallows ' Eve encounter with the devil . " And you were furious and you were afraid they 'd use those pictures so you ran away , right ? " " I did n't think of it that way at the time . I was just making sure I could finish my history paper by the end of the semester . Martha and Lucas were so adamant about taking charge of Joanna 's life . They 'd already decided God was their copilot or something like that , which gave them license to do . . . whatever . " She leans back , glad to be done talking about Martha and Lucas , thinking only , Say you can help me find my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer to justice . " Here we go again , " Murchison says softly . " Maybe the Starrs are card-carrying members . I 'll do my best to find out . And I 'll try to find out if there 's any buzz about a new child rescued on the East Coast . I ca n't promise I 'll succeed  --  those people have charged into the computer age with a vengeance , and they keep changing access codes practically every other day . If they ca n't win by going through the system , they 'll look for a way to hack their way around it . But I do want something in return . I 'm working on ? " " I was waiting for this . You want to sell the story of sweet little Joanna Vincent to the highest bidder , right ? Well , I 'm not ready to have my daughter cut up into lurid paragraphs for the Inquirer , or handy sound bites for Hard Copy . ' I do n't think there 's a whole lot I can do for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bites or smarmy stories , Ms. Vincent . " His face is ashen , his mouth drawn taut . " I do want a written account of everything that happens and how you feel about it . Nothing fancy , just a page or two every day , more if you 're so inclined . And then p 67 you turn it over to me and it becomes a chapter in the book I 'm working on . About DASH . I 've got an agent and a publisher and a deadline of Christmas . All I want is a little of your soul . " Valerie looks away from his tortured face . She 's been so fixed on a concept , on the idea of him as journalist , that she 's misplaced Kevin Murchison 's humanity . " Why are you so interested in DASH , Mr. Murchison ? " she asks softly . In the tidy , sunlit room , Kevin Murchison seems to be pushing back the curtain of time , and it appears as difficult for him as it had been for her the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jabs at the yellow pad until the point snaps , lets the pencil fall from his grasp and roll off the table to the floor . " My sister was a guidance counselor in a lovely suburban elementary school . For some reason , she became a target . Maybe those prim ladies and their starched-shirt husbands did n't approve of my sister 's pretty , petite live-in companion . Maybe my sister and her lady love were too open about the fact that they liked each other just fine and no men need apply . " The picture in the bottom row , that joyous , laughing young woman . . . It takes all her will to keep her gaze focused on the table . " Anyway , before the bastards really got rolling on their smear campaign , two , three parents of kids who were getting into trouble ? lighting fires in the bathroom , stealing things out of other kids ' lock-ers  --  went to the principal to complain about her being part of a Satanic conspiracy . She was on her way home from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her car did n't make it around a curve . A very big tree was waiting to slow her down , and kablooey , road kill . " His clenched fists , his tight mouth  --  she recognizes how much effort it takes to keep the pain of his loss at bay . He exhales loudly . " I do n't know if she killed herself or if someone forced her off the road or if it was just a goddamn accident . But if DASH had n't gone after her , if those parents had n't picked her as a target and an explanation for all their kids ' problems , my gut tells me she 'd still be alive . I quit my job three weeks after she died . No accountant walks away from a potential partnership at Peat Marwick . No accountant but me . I started doing research on those  | bastards the next day , Ms. Vincent , and I have n't stopped . Whether you decide to work with me or not , " he says as his eyes meet hers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry about your sister . " She wants to say more , but words feel empty , useless . " Look , I need help making a strong case and getting it into the public record . This book is the best way I know to achieve my goal , and I 'm asking for your help . If you ca n't do it , do n't worry , we 'll work something out . " He says it without a leer , and his voice is kind . " You walk in here and tell me your story and say you want advice but you 're also asking for reassurance . I could say things that might make you feel better , sure , but I 'm not going to lie to you . Maybe DASH has changed the rules . And I need to know more about you . They sent one of their people up here once before , cunning , really , and it 's made me take , well , precautions I did n't before that . " Cunning : no one 's ever used that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man , even sitting here in his put-together studio apartment surrounded by the things that define his life , feels unsafe . " Thanks for taking the time to see me , Mr. Murchison . And thanks for your honesty . I guess we both have to think about what happens next . I 'm not even sure I can do what you 're asking . " " If you think there might be a chance this group is connected to your daughter 's disappearance , you 'll be back , Valerie Vincent . And I already have a pretty good idea of what I 'm going to find when I check you out . Here . " He slides a large , dun-colored envelope across his desk . " Go ahead . Read it all . Then decide if you want to figure out a way to work with me. "  | With a rush of cold wind and the deafening screech of metal wheels against metal tracks , her subway train finally arrives at the West Fourth Street station . She scrambles past an old man in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the car just before the doors close . Valerie finds a seat and opens the packet Murchison handed her . His history is right here , source material that will give her a handle on what to expect from him and from DASH . She 'll wade through the stuff he 's pressed into her hands and examine it with the skills she 's picked up reading the three-hundred-year-old court transcripts of the Salem witch trials . And she 'll remember that each person is n't just a tidy category , a colonial settler , a pioneer , a member of a temperance society . Not just a chapter of a book . A sheaf of photocopied pages slides out of the envelope and almost falls from her hands . The stories , all with Kevin Murchison 's byline , are written with cool detachment , tales of men and women in California , Virginia , Montana whose dreams were stolen , reputations trashed , peace of mind destroyed by the threat of having their children taken from them . If she had come across the articles before Halloween , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would  | have leaped out at her . . . but more for their relevance to seven-teenth-century Salem than for personal reasons . Two more stops . Papers rattle in her hands as the car shuttles forward , and she reads every word . Invariably Murchison 's articles describe the same scenario . The defense lawyer calls friends of local DASH members as witnesses . Despite themselves , those fine , upstanding citizens end up providing alibis for the accused or attesting to their good character . The lawyer offers a calm , reasoned closing argument and then celebrates victory by granting a single interview  --  to Murchison . It 's the ultimate irony , the perfect punishment for him . Those same mad gods who delighted in watching her squirm in Professor Clarkson 's office have provided him with the opportunity to warn the world about DASH . But , just as she ca n't bring Esther back to life , he 'll never be able to save his own sister . Can Kevin Murchi-son 's obsession possibly help her get Joanna back ? She stuffs the photocopies into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carried along by the crowd , she walks briskly onto the street . The gray sky has lowered ; a wind whips scraps of paper , thin as dandelion fluff , in an eddy in front of a newsstand . Fourteen months . Murchison said it took over a year to find a child whose parents went to the press with their story . Joanna would be almost three . . . Has some rabid reporter written a heart-wrenching , little piece about Esther 's murder , about the fate of Baby Jane Doe ? She scoops up the three dailies , tosses a handful of change onto the counter , and hurries past the smell of frying onions and curry toward the park . Out of habit , she almost turns right at Seventh Avenue , to head for Esther 's apartment . She stops herself in time and waits until the tears pass before she starts down Flatbush Avenue again . As she approaches the huge granite arch in the center of Grand Army Plaza , she looks up at the horse-drawn chariot marching across the top . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monuments that celebrate war  --  but for the first time she almost understands . She 's engaged in a war too . Yes , she 'll take Murchison 's deal . Not much of a burden , really , to keep a journal that makes a little sense of this mess and records  |p71.  the important bits . School habits are still so ingrained she sometimes believes she ca n't think without a pen in her hand . Maybe the exercise will help her see her daughter 's face instead of the hazy picture she tries to hold in her mind as it fades with alarming regularity . She wants a personal payoff  --  eating breakfast with her daughter , gathering wildflowers to put in a mayonnaise jar on the table . Holding Joanna in her arms would be enough . What a moment that will be . She 'll kneel and speak softly , maybe hold the Babar book casually in one hand while she asks Joanna if she 's hungry . Raisins and hard pretzels . She should have some around so that when A horn blares . Cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chokes on the oily fumes . She looks up into a driver 's face , twisted in anger as he leans out the window , shouts , " Wake up , lady ! " and then peels away . Shaken , she runs ahead to the safety of the sidewalk and clutches the newspapers and the large envelope to her chest to slow her racing heart . The driver is right . If something happens to her . . . she ca n't let Joanna return to a motherless world . She must be careful . It 's too easy to slip into a dream haven , like the one Kristin Denby created on the second floor of Antonia 's brownstone . Too tempting to pretend away the truth . Before she can escape to the silence of the upstairs bedroom , Antonia calls her name , says it like a summons rather than a greeting , so that it 's clear she 's expected to make an appearance . Antonia is waiting in the living room , her back to the cold fireplace , her hands running restlessly along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mornings so she can hear Valerie 's key in the door , her footsteps on the polished wood floor of the entryway . " Oh , my dear , I 'm so glad you 're back . There 's been a phone call . " Valerie ca n't read the look on the woman 's face . " I ca n't figure out how he knew to call you here . This is such a hopeful sign . " The woman 's words make no sense . " Antonia , I do n't understand  | what you 're saying . Please , start at the beginning and tell me what 's going on . " " Ten minutes ago , a man called . He sounded , well , the best way to describe his voice is senatorial . Very refined , deep voice , perfect enunciation , as though he were used to delivering orations . " Not Russo , not Lucas or Johnny . Not anyone she can think of . " When I told him you were out , he almost hung up on me but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would talk only to you . He said it was about Joanna . "  | It seems to take a century before Antonia continues , time enough for Valerie to recognize the light of hope seeping into the dark tunnel she 's tumbled into . Finally , an end to the waiting . Or , at least , a break in it . " He said not to call the police , that Joanna was all right now , but if you contacted the police , that might not be the case anymore . He insisted he 'd talk only to you . He said he 'd call back . Just before he hung up , he said the oddest thing . It 's my burden to protect the children . ' It was chilling , Valerie , positively chilling . " To protect the children . She 's read Murchison 's papers . That sounds like the kind of pompous phrase DASH might dream up . " Nothing else ? No demands , no conditions ? " " That was all . That awful threat about not calling the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd sentence . " Valerie understands for the first time how people can kill with their bare hands . If this anonymous , sadistic caller were standing in front of her . . . The rush of fury almost scares her . " You did n't call the police , right ? " " Of course not . That 's not my decision to make , my dear . You must have the final say in this matter . But I certainly would n't an-  | tagonize this man , whoever he is . " Antonia is gentle . " Who knows you 're staying here with me ? Your lawyer . Your policeman . This writer in the city . Who else ? " " No one . No one who would tell anyone . " Do n't call the police . The person who delivered that warning is n't worried about keeping children from harm . He 's anxious to protect himself from being charged with Esther 's murder . In her mind , she listens to voices  --  friends , acquaintances , teachers , colleagues , shopkeepers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would describe it as senatorial . A stranger , then . A messenger , perhaps . " The caller  --  he could be playing John Alden to Lucas and Martha 's Miles Standish . They 're trying to bargain their way out of a murder charge . Joanna 's their ace . They could be planning to turn her over to me as long as I do n't bring the cops or anyone else into it . " Antonia nods . " That 's certainly shrewd . " And then it hits her with stunning force . She has n't understood until this minute , but it 's so right , no question it 's the explanation for what they did on Halloween and everything that 's happened since . " Oh , God  --  it 's not Joanna they 're after . They want their son . What I have to do is promise them Johnny and find a way to give him to them . " That 's what they want . That 's all they 've wanted all along Johnny for Joanna . I 'll help you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair trade : her child for theirs . " Valerie , you 're not thinking clearly . You ca n't make that promise and not deliver . Your ex-husband could be anywhere , my dear . From what you 've told me about his drinking , he might be one of those pathetic men on the streets begging for change . Sit down and I 'll get Nadia to bring you a glass of cool water . " The bell tinkles , rain falling on a sheet of silver . Nadia appears , then hurries away to fulfill Antonia 's request . Valerie paces , wanders to the window , to the table where the telephone refuses to ring . Joanna has been missing nearly eighteen hours now . How much longer will he make her wait for his call ? She goes to the kitchen and into the upstairs bedrooms to make sure the phones are working , that they have n't somehow been left  | off the hook . And then she remembers the newspapers  --  the call could have been prompted by a story . . . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three papers . Page 5 of the New York Post . Page 7 of the Daily News . Two paragraphs about Esther , only a single line about the child sent home with her mother , whose identity the police will not release . No photos . No mention at all in the New York Times . Thank God . Antonia is still in front of the fireplace when she returns to the living room , but she says nothing as Valerie rummages through the drawer of the lamp table , finds a notepad and a pen , then sits down again , her hand tight on the telephone receiver . Waiting , waiting . That 's all she 's been doing . If she knew who made that call .. . " You know what they say about the mountain not coming to Mohammed . " The receiver is cold against her hand . " Are you suggesting you 're going to call Lucas Starr ? " Alarm pushes Antonia 's voice higher , makes her words tight and clipped . " Is n't that risky ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're right . But I can find out if he knows anything about the phone call . I 'll work the phrase about protecting the children into the conversation and see how he reacts . It would be better in person . I 'd have the advantage of seeing his face . But the telephone will do , if I listen carefully . " Of course she can do it . Can judge from the quality of his voice , from his pauses , from his breathing , whether Lucas Starr is her anonymous caller . At last . Something she can do for Joanna . Excited , she dials the number . They have only one phone , in the kitchen , but they turn the bell up loud so they can hear it when they 're working in the garden . The hard part will be keeping herself cool , prowling through their secrets like an ocelot stalking a small jungle creature . She can do this . She has to . " This is Lucas Starr , " the voice says , and she knows right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tears of frustration sting her eyes . She swallows hard and goes on . " I got your message . I have n't told the police or anyone else . Please , call me back . I really want to talk to you . " Antonia is dabbing a finger into a tiny pot of lip gloss , applying  | the clear red to her mouth with utter concentration . She 's turned toward the window , as though she 's actually looking the other way to give Valerie privacy . When Valerie has replaced the receiver , Antonia says , " Have you had anything to eat today , my dear , anything at all ? " She ca n't remember . The gnawing emptiness in the center of her has nothing to do with food , she knows that much . " I 'm not hun-gry , " she says . " Would you like some tea , Valerie ? Or perhaps some company for a while ? " She does n't want company . She wants her daughter . But she must n't let her pain consume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her veins . Valerie lowers herself to the sofa , her mind veering crazily to the thought that Joanna has n't had her vitamins in two days . She was like a baby bird with those infant vitamins , opened her mouth in a little 0 when Valerie squeezed the dropper , an eager nestling craving some delicate nectar . Vitamins . A year from now , are these the only details she 'll have left of Joanna ? " I do n't know what to do , Antonia . I 'm afraid to call Russo and I 'm afraid not to . And I keep getting these crazy pictures of Joanna in my head . " " I 'm sure they 're not crazy , my dear . It 's only natural . You 'd be a strange mother if you were n't thinking about your child . Maybe you should just talk about her a little . Before you left to see that writer , you were about to tell me about her . " The chair backs up , then rolls to Antonia 's favorite daytime spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about her temperament , as I recall . " Joanna 's temperament . Antonia did ask about that earlier . " Actually , she 's always had this kind of , I do n't know , I 'd call it a cheerful steadfastness . When I was studying , she used to crawl right onto my lap without saying a word . When I tilted my head , she tilted hers . When I reached for a pencil , she wanted one too . " She 'd held it in her fist , pudgy fingers clasped tight as she scribbled happily , giggling with delight and astonishment , filling the paper with coils and flecks and zigzag lines , her sturdy little body warm and relaxed against Valerie 's chest . p 77 " We read De Tocqueville and Cotton Mather together . And then we ? " Read about Salem and witches and persecution and hangings . Valerie ca n't say the words aloud , not now . " She 's a healthy child , is she not ? Physically , I mean . " Antonia 's still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the doorway . " What is it , Nadia ? " Valerie 's been so engrossed in talking about Joanna she has n't even heard the woman come in . " I 'm going out now . To take care of that errand . " Nadia peers into the depth of her open purse . " I have it , " she says , " so I 'll be back later . " Antonia waves her away impatiently . " Well , then , go ahead . Valerie and I are talking . " Nadia , who probably does n't realize how Antonia hates to have stories interrupted , looks offended at the brusqueness , but she only nods and disappears from the doorway . " Now then , my dear . You were going to tell me more about your daughter . " Valerie roots around in the past and unearths images . Joanna , eyes wide with surprise as she gets her first DPT shot . Joanna , a year ago , crying and tugging at her ear . This time , the exercise brings her daughter so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white of Joanna 's T-shirt . " Nothing serious , the usual early stuff , earaches and colds . One night she woke up crying , pressing her head to her shoulder . Her skin was so hot it frightened me . Poor thing , she was miserable . When she looked at me through those red eyes , I was sure she was wondering why I did n't stop the pain . I bundled her up and tore down the back roads to the hospital emergency room in Hudson . They gave her an antibiotic and within two hours she was asleep again and smiling . " " And she 's a bright child , I 'd guess . She walked sooner than other children and spoke earlier , did n't she ? " Antonia leans forward , her cheeks flushed with anticipation . Despite herself , Valerie smiles with the memory . " The first thing Joanna ever said was ' Poppy . ' She was nine months old . " She can almost smell the vegetable soup simmering on the stove , can see the way the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightening the tiny room . Her kitchen , her sweat that had transformed it . Weeks of scraping cabinets , uncovering layers of yellow and blue and orange  --  who in the world would paint cabinets orange ? Applying two coats of Navaho Sand , hanging the carefully matted pictures of fruits and vegetables she 'd cut from last year 's calendar . And then Sarah Hoving saying , " It 's perfect , Val . Small but perfect for a woman who lives by the motto that cooking is terrific as long as someone else is doing it . " Is it possible that Ruth Hoving , Sarah 's mother-in-law and one of the movers and shakers in Taconic Hills , knew that Martha and Lucas were planning to rescue Joanna ? Maybe she should call Sarah and " Valerie , dear . You were saying ? " Antonia is smiling , her head propped against her fist . What was she saying ? " Poppy , " Antonia prompts . Right . Joanna 's first word . " She had this game she loved to play , the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing , but Joanna loved the fun of it . She 'd pick something up and then drop it to the floor and laugh and squeal . I was supposed to look surprised and then put it back in her reach and then the game would start all over again . One day , we were in the kitchen and all of a sudden Joanna said ' Poppy ' and started wailing . " The only thing anywhere near her high chair was this book , one of those cloth things with bright , textured patches on each page . She must have said it ten times . ' Poppy , Poppy , Poppy . ' I gave her the book and she hugged it and said it again . ' Poppy . ' As clear as could be , smiling away . " And then I made the connection . We 'd been visiting my friend Lynn the day before . Her dog came to check out Joanna 's toys and he picked the book up in his mouth . When he started trotting out of the room with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , head hanging , and gave her the book . It took me a while to straighten Joanna out that Poppy was the name of Lynn 's dog and not the word for book . " " Less than a year  --  is n't that early for a child to speak ? Well , the experts say it helps develop language facility if you read to children p 79 and talk to them a lot when they 're young . And I 'm sure you spoke to her all the time . Her father was n't there to talk to her , was he ? " Head canted and mouth pursed in thought , Antonia asks , " How did you meet him ? " The Johnny Starr she met that day was so different from the man who disappeared more than a year ago . " At a Fourth of July party in Taconic Hills . Five years ago . " " Fourth of July in a small country town . Ah , I have n't done that in ages , " Antonia sighs . " It was beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine , gentle breezes . I was new in town . The party was at Ruth Hoving 's house and Catherine Delaney took me on a tour of the place . Wonderful colonial chests and wardrobes , an old bed that was so high you needed a stool to climb into it . It was like a museum of Americana . Except for one painting in the upstairs hall , a huge canvas full of slashing blood-red lines on a black background . I kept wanting to look away but I could n't take my eyes off it . Finally , I said something like , This really gives me the creeps . I ca n't imagine wanting to look at this every day . ' Catherine kept grinning over my shoulder . I just rattled on and on about how the painting looked like a nightmare or a war zone in a battle that would never end . " " And Johnny was standing on the stairs , was n't he ? " Antonia seems amused . " He heard everything you said . " " Every bit of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone describe so clearly what he wanted to say in that painting . We all three spent a couple of hours talking about a million things . Catherine left and Johnny and I just kept talking . I 'd thrown on jeans and an old blouse that morning but Johnny made me feel like I was wearing a Victorian summer frock and a straw hat . From that day until the night we were married , I felt like I was starring in a hap-pily-ever-after movie . But then ? " The telephone shrills . She ca n't breathe . This is it . The call she 's been waiting for . The senatorial voice . She snatches the receiver from the cradle and manages to say , " This is Valerie . " " Mitch Russo , " the voice announces , and she nearly cries out in disappointment . " I wanted to check in , you know , touch base with you . How 'd it go with Murchison ? "  | She was in Kevin Murchison 's apartment just a few hours ago . Came home at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the call . . . " Fine . It was fine . " " Yeah , well , he 's a writer , not a magician . I told you we took some prints last night ? They match the prints we found in Esther Klein 's apartment . We 're running them against our files and if we do n't get a hit , we 'll send them on to Washington . Listen , I still want to talk to your husband . You 're sure you do n't remember where he is ? " " I ca n't remember , Detective Russo . I never knew . " If only she did . . . " Did you find out about this Phelps woman in Taconic Hills ? Do you know if Martha and Lucas Starr belong to DASH ? Did you talk to anyone who might have seen my daughter last night after the car dropped them at the subway ? " It takes him a while to answer . " Look , we 're after the same thing here . The only call I got from Taconic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To say he recognized you and your daughter from the picture I faxed him . We 're checking it all , Ms. Vincent . You 're sure there 's nothing else , something you thought of that I should know ? " " No . Nothing . " Not that she 's ready to tell him . Not yet , anyway .  | It felt so good to have her scalp massaged , Kristin Denby thought maybe she 'd just come in every day and let Marie wash her hair . But she did n't plan to spend her whole life in Park Slope , and Marie was a Brooklyn girl through and through . " Too hot ? " Marie moved the water spray so that it splashed against the side of the sink . " Perfect . " Eyes still closed , Kristin waited for the cascade of water to flow over her again , carrying with it the accumulated tensions that had gathered in her neck and shoulders . Lying back and letting her mind go empty was such an infrequent pleasure these days , and nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this situation with Charles was resolved . Not until Antonia understood why she could n't go through with the wedding plans . Marie was chattering about something , her voice barely audible above the splash and hiss of the water , not even aware she was talking to herself . Which was a good thing , since Kristin hated making conversation with people whose paths would n't cross hers except in a shop or a restaurant or a beauty salon . Antonia always said the key to living successfully in society was to find some bit of common ground with each person you met , whether at a dinner party or the corner grocery . With Marie , that was a stretch .  | " Okay , honey , Paolo 's waiting for you . " Marie blotted the dripping water from Kristin 's forehead , then wrapped the towel around her head and patted her shoulder . Kristin sighed , sat up , opened her eyes to the too bright fluorescent lights of the salon . Salon . In Manhattan these days , the advertising copywriters were calling beauty shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not her sugar daddy , not her gold mine or her power figure . An icon : Charles would like that . Paolo motioned her to the chair , his full mouth stretched into a grin above the two-day stubble darkening his jaw and the space above his lips . His customary jeans and white T-shirt fit well on his compact body ; at least he had the good sense not to dress absurdly . Paolo , with that short , gleaming wave that dipped onto his forehead and those almost stubby fingers , looked more like an auto mechanic than a hairdresser . He even kept a picture of his wife and kids stuck in the mirror at his station . Stylist . Was n't that what he called him-self ? " Growing a beard ? " she asked brightly as she lowered herself into the soft leather seat . In the mirror , his brown eyes registered surprise . " You ask a question like that ? I thought you were au courant , pretty face . " Whenever he called her that , she wanted to call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was growing up in Bensonhurst . Instead , she said , " You 've been hanging around too many dentists ' offices , Paolo . " He frowned and ran his tongue over his front teeth . " Reading old magazines , " she continued . " The grungy , unshaven look is out , you know . " " Speaking of which , " Paolo said smugly , " when are you going to let me do something with all that hair ? " Why not ? Antonia had said countless times , in her arbiter-offashion firmness , that Kristin should update her look . A simple bob , chin-length , shiny . It will draw attention to your intelligent eyes , Kristin , instead of just to your hair . And then went on and on about simplicity being the hallmark of true style . Never used the word " class , " of course , not Antonia Carrera . Hell , why not ? " Okay , Paolo , but no shorter than here , " she said , grazing her jaw with the back of her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? "  | " Ah , finally ! I 've been waiting for you to say that . " His hands were in her hair , lifting it , pulling tendrils forward onto her forehead , folding the mass of it behind her . " Your face is a perfect oval , so we do n't have to worry about correcting , you know , flaws of nature . You 're right . I see you with a medium-length bob , unlayered except for a little interest around your forehead and temples . Great texture , wonderful body , a little natural curl  --  it 's perfect for you . " She nodded her agreement . " Let 's do it . I have to be out of here in thirty-five minutes , okay ? " His eyes sought hers in the mirror . " I passed the test , did I ? " She returned his smile and removed her earrings , held them in her hand . " Part one . Now you have to actually make it look good . I want people who know me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't to think I 've looked like this forever . And no conversation today , Paolo . I have a lot on my mind . " He bowed and reached for his scissors . Wordlessly he clipped a mass of hair to the top of her head and began to snip at the length in the back . Eyes closed  --  she trusted him , wanted to see only the finished product and not watch the transformation in process  --  Kristin began to review her plan . Because she wanted to spare him the jolt of an abrupt departure , she 'd send the note in the mail . Dear Charles , I 'm sorry that I 've worried you lately . I 've tried several times but I ca n't seem to say the right words when we 're together . I 'm still not completely comfortable talking about these feelings , but I find myself confused and I value you too much to deceive you . That 's why I 've written this letter . It 's better for you to know a little than to wander about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please try to understand . I need a few days by myself to sort things out . Love , Kristin . No timetable , of course , and no demands . No explanations or dissertations on his fawning , how that adoration made her feel like some specimen under a microscope , a butterfly trapped in a glass paperweight . Only that sympathetic preparation for what would follow later .  | Just to prove her moral compass was still working , she 'd send him back his ring and all the other jewelry . Perfect . In a couple of days , after he 'd had the chance to absorb the utterly unchangeable truth of her absence , she 'd tell Charles she could n't marry him . It would be hard on him , but simply disappearing would devastate the man . She 'd find a way to convince him that it was n't him , oh no , absolutely not him but her own restlessness , her need to discover more about herself . Maybe she 'd even say she was dazzled at first by his money and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The suggestion that they see other people , live their lives separately and without any commitments to a future together would seem , eventually , like a kindness , a realistic , reasonable , and entirely unavoidable kindness . The real trick in calling off her engagement to Charles Babcock would be to avoid Antonia 's displeasure . Antonia , who had so much experience in engineering these matches , had made sure Kristin and Charles sat near each other or across the table , threw them together whenever she could manage . After all , you 're about to turn thirty . He 's an ideal companion , do n't you think , my dear ? Witty , devoted , a man of substance . As though those qualities were sufficient in themselves and the case was therefore closed . As though her age were a magic number , and she 'd turn into a dull , lumpy clod of a pumpkin unless she got married before her thirtieth birthday . Paolo removed the clip , let another section of long hair fall against her back , swiftly pinned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw only his rapt , attentive gaze fixed on her hair , and sank back into thought . It would n't be right to string Charles along and let him go on thinking the relationship was salvageable . In time , he 'd find someone else who actually thrived on the kind of smothery attention he paid her , who loved it when he stared at her in stricken , lovesick disbelief . Eventually he 'd understand that he was lucky they had n't gone through with a marriage that could only have ended unhappily . If they were both lucky , that 's how it would work . Even if he insisted on nursing his hurt publicly , she would be able to say she 'd done her best . And she 'd be free of him . She could n't wait until the  | whole Charles thing was resolved to start getting ready for the rest of her life . The last time she 'd spoken to her , Antonia had mentioned a couple overseas somewhere who " Open your eyes a minute , pretty face . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sides . " She glared at him . " I thought I told you just go ahead and do it . That I did n't want to talk . " Scissors dangling in his outstretched hand , Paolo stood frozen behind her . " Hey , hey , sorry . You go back to your daydream . " God , she 'd been rude . Unintentionally , of course , but she should n't have taken out her problems on poor Paolo . " I did n't mean to snap like that . I guess I 'm a little tense . " With his free hand , he massaged her neck , the strong fingers pushing the knots into submission so easily she had to smile with pleasure and relief . " All right , baby , close your eyes again and I 'll finish in silence . You ever try running ? Meditation ? All those magazines say ? " Paolo laughed softly . " Whoops . You sit back and I 'll be quiet . " Her train of thought was broken , the prospects too vague to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonia 's international friends to make any decisions yet . Besides , she needed to come up with a third plan , one that did n't involve getting help from anyone . You could n't count on people . In the end , they always did what served themselves best , and she 'd be a fool if she let herself forget that .  | All that plaster work made him thirsty . Johnny Starr looked longingly at the lanky kid on the corner slugging from a brown bottle wrapped in a brown paper bag . If he were a diabetic , he would n't go buy some candy every time he saw some ten-year-old munching on a Snickers bar . The rush of pleasure had a sledgehammer attached to it . Drinking was n't worth the trou-ble . Especially not now , with so much at stake . He ducked into the corner bodega , grabbed a bottled iced tea , nodded at the tiny woman behind the counter as he laid his dollar bill down . " Gracias , " he said , smiling and scooping up his change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smelled them before he saw them . Lilacs , the first of spring , most of the flowers still closed tight in dark clusters hidden among the deep green leaves . Francine loved lilacs , and it was definitely time for a celebration . Shaking water from the woody stalks , he walked back to the counter . " Com-bien ? " " Six . " She said it without a trace of Spanish accent , and without a smile . p 87 Okay , so he 'd work an extra half hour next week . Francine had stuck by him through a hard time . Soon a six-dollar purchase would hardly make a dent . On the street , he felt a little like a character from some fifties musical , Gene Kelly maybe , courting the girl next door . Well , he did n't really have to prove anything to Francine , but he felt like dancing anyway . God , it was good when things went the way you planned . Luck had nothing to do with it . He 'd earned every bloody bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pleasure , too . Humming , stopping once in the middle of the block to do a little two-step , Johnny Starr hurried home with his good feelings and his lilacs . " They 're so beautiful . Here , I want to get them in water and put them in the sun so they 'll open up . " Francine had to shout above the racket of the jackhammer in the street below . She buried her face in the flowers again , then leaned forward and kissed him . " This is n't an apology of some sort , is it ? And do n't tell me these are Valerie 's favorite flowers or I 'll walk out this door this minute . " " Will you shut up and say thank you ? I said once , once , that you look like my ex-wife and you carry on as though that 's the only reason I 'm with you . " The jackhammer stopped all at once , and he realized he did n't have to shout anymore . " I do n't even know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I had to work on Saturday and we did n't have any time together and you love lilacs and I love you . " And he did . Loved the way she did n't nag him about painting , as Valerie used to , loved how she surprised him with tickets to a Rangers game for his birthday . And , especially , loved having her share his dreams . Dark hair cascaded down her back as she stretched to reach the milk bottle she 'd picked up a month earlier at a street fair for twenty-five cents . She filled it with water , arranged the flowers . " Johnny , there 's something I want to talk to you about . " The air went out of him , as though he 'd taken a huge bellywhop-  | per into Stissing Lake . Her face , set in that carefully controlled emptiness , exactly matched the tone of her voice . She was trying to defuse some bomb she was about to drop , working really hard at it , not succeeding . " I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Johnny laughed , from sheer relief and because earlier he 'd thought the same thing in practically the same words . " You really scared me for a minute there . " " Well , I did n't know how you 'd feel if I came right out and told you everything at once . " " Everything ? There 's more ? " She nodded , unable to suppress her smile . " You remember my friend Ellie from work ? She 's moving back to Ohio and she wants to know if we want her rent-controlled apartment . It 's not huge , two tiny bedrooms , a kitchen Pavarotti could n't turn around in , and a living room with a little L-shaped dining area . And it 's on Carmine Street , in the Village . " This really was a sign that they were on the right track . " That 's great , Franny . You scared the shit out of me , you know that ? You were so serious . I thought you were about to say you did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met a guy who could buy you roses every day . " " You have to stop that . " The pulse in her neck beat rapidly . She planted herself in front of him and tugged playfully at his beard . " That 's really insulting , you know ? Anyway , you 're changing the topic . This is starting to feel like the incredible shrinking apartment and the neighborhood is getting to me . Can we do it , Johnny ? Take that place in the Village and get out of here , finally ? " " You 're right . Okay , let 's make a deal . I 'll go see the apartment if you think , I mean really think , about marrying me . " He touched her hair and bent to kiss her . " Maybe it 's just habit , but I get scared every once in a while that this whole plan will fall apart . Promise me . Marry me , Franny . Think about it , at least . We can do it in City Hall or at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words . They were n't expecting visitors . Suddenly ashen , Francine pulled away , held a finger to her lips . What now ?  | He stood unmoving , straining to hear some clue from the other side of the door . Again , the buzzer blared , two short , impatient jabs . " Mr. Starr . It 's the police . " The jackhammer started up again , drowning out the voice . Francine backed away slowly , headed for the bedroom , and pulled the door closed . The police . " Mr. Starr , I know you 're in there . You came in five minutes ago , carrying flowers . I need to talk to you . " Could someone have followed him ? Obviously , and it was someone who knew what they were doing . If it was the police and if he did n't respond , it would look suspicious . A fist pounded at the door , and the voice shouted , " Mr. Starr , open up . " Johnny unlocked the door and stared at the upturned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held up a leather wallet containing a shield and a photo ID . " Mr. Starr ? John Starr ? " She flipped the wallet shut and slipped it into her purse . " Yes . Look , what 's going on ? What 's this all about ? I 'm sorry , I did n't get your name , Miss ? " " Detective . Detective Gallagher . I 'd like to talk to you . " The heavy equipment battered at the sidewalk below . Shit , just what he needed . Just when everything was going so well . " What 's this about , Detective Gallagher ? " " I 'm investigating the murder of a woman named Esther Klein . Now , can I come in or is there something you 'd rather I did n't see ? " She filled the doorway now , taking up more space than a woman her size could possibly occupy . " Esther Klein ? The lady in the next building , the one with the squeaky shopping cart ? " Johnny swung the door open , noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket of her blazer . " I do n't think I know anyone named Esther Klein . " Her hand dropped to her side as she moved into the living room , walked to the window , then headed for the bathroom and peered inside . He had the shakes , goddamn racking shakes like he 'd never expe-  | rienced when he was going through detox . The only way to keep his knees from banging together was to sit down . " Where were you last night , Mr. Starr ? " She was cutting him no slack . " Here , sprawled out on the bed watching the Knicks game . " Feeling good because he had a can of cold Sprite in his hand , not the beer it would have been a year ago . Francine had n't come back yet . " And before the game ? Late afternoon , say between three and four ? " This time it was his hands that started trembling , and he stuffed them into his pockets . " On my way to an AA meeting . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-thirty . I go to that one on the Upper East Side because they do n't allow smoking . I ca n't stand to be in a closed room with ten , twenty cigarettes going at once . Makes me sick . " Detective Gallagher sat down in the chair across from him . Francine 's chair . She leaned forward , chin on hands , elbows resting on her knees , and just stared . Kept her eyes locked to his , until he frowned . " What ? " The jackhammer pounded away , and the throbbing behind his eyes swelled to fill his head . " I want to know why you 're asking me all this . I already told you , I do n't know any Esther Klein . " " And I want to know why Jimmy Gilhooley told me you left before three yesterday . " " Who ? Jimmy who ? " This was crazy , this cop sitting there and dragging out names of people he 'd never even " The floor guy , the one who was working at that loft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shrugged . " Jimmy says you left a little before three . " " Oh , right . I had to meet a friend who was lending me money . I forgot about that . " Gallagher did n't crack a smile . " A friend ? You 're going to tell me this friend 's name , right ? " Involuntarily Johnny looked at the bedroom door . " Why do you need to know that ? Listen , I 'm trying to be cooperative here , but I do n't have a clue what 's going on . Why did you go to all the trouble to find me ? " p 91 " When 's the last time you spoke to your parents , Mr. Starr ? " She was trying to disarm him with her jackrabbit tactics , jumping all over the open field , hoping he would n't figure out what she was up to . " I ca n't remember . A long time , over a year . What 's this about , Detective Gallagher ? " " When did you last see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room would stop spinning and that this woman sitting with her back straight and her hand reaching for her pocket would go away . " My daughter ? " " Yes , Mr. Starr . Your daughter . " " My ex-wife did n't ask for child support . What 's going on ? " " This is n't about child support , Mr. Starr . When did you last see your daughter ? " Abruptly the clattering of the machinery outside stopped . " A month after she was born . A year ago November . " This was n't going well , he could tell from the Yeah , prove it expression on the cop 's face . From the bedroom , a rhythmic tapping ticked through the air . Like a deer reacting to a motion in the underbrush , Detective Gal-lagher 's body jerked upright and she bolted for the door . She wrapped her left hand around the doorknob ; her right hand drew the gun from her pocket . In a single clean movement , she turned the knob and pushed the door open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallagher ran to the open window , peered at the rusting fire escape , then hoisted herself up and wriggled outside . Johnny saw only her shoes and the crisp cuff of her pants as she stood at the far edge near the railing , where she could see the alley below . The detective lowered herself back into the room . Francine had moved quickly . Her back to him , Gallagher grabbed the framed photograph from the dresser . Their day in Rockaway . A stranger had agreed to take their picture . And had done a bad job of it , had stood too far away , had moved so everything was a little blurred , out of focus . Still , Francine had treasured the photo . " Who 's this ? "  | " A friend . Listen  --  I have a right to know what 's going on . " " All those dark curls , " she asked softly , " do they fit under a baseball cap ? " " What does this have to do with Joanna ? " " Sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After you answer all my questions . "  | Idly she writes Joanna Claire on the notepad , but it 's no use . She ca n't give Kevin Murchison what he 's asked for , at least not now . For one thing , she 's ravenous . The dark , restless hours she 's spent in the tangle of sheets and blankets in the canopy bed have only made her hungry , not wiser , not calmer . Besides , her mind insists on skittering . She wonders what Russo and Gallagher have been doing , hopes her daughter slept better than she did , replays the phone calls she made last night before it got too late to go on  --  old friends of Johnny 's , his high school art teacher , neighbors in Taconic Hills  --  dead ends , all of them . The story came easily after the first call : she 's a gallery owner trying to find Johnny Starr because she 's interested in his work . But no one has any idea where he might be . At least , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny . The house is silent , the kitchen streaked with morning light . A robin struts in the grass between the slate slabs that form a path through the backyard . Still wearing the robe she found in Kristin 's closet , Valerie starts the coffee maker , grabs butter , three eggs , two slices of bread , a jar of orange marmalade from the refrigerator , her stomach grumbling with impatience . p 95 The cast-iron frying pan hanging from the rack above the stove is just the right size . Within seconds , the smell of sizzling butter makes her mouth water . " Quick eggs . " That 's what her mother used to call them , breaking the fragile shells on the side of the pan , dropping the eggs into the butter , scrambling them in the pan until they were just set , the white not quite mixed into the yolk . She 's glad no one 's watching as she shakes salt and pepper onto the eggs and scoops a forkful from the pan into her mouth . She alternates great bites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty when she hears the elevator deposit Antonia 's wheelchair into the hall . " Nadia would have made you breakfast . " The kitchen doorway , narrower than the arched entries to the other rooms , is wide enough for Antonia 's wheelchair to pass through , but she remains in the hall . She 's smiling , already dressed in taupe slacks and a matching shirt . " I 'm glad your appetite is back , Valerie . Since you 're not sleeping , you need food to keep you going . " " Was I that noisy last night ? " She brushes crumbs from the counter into her hand , dumps them into the garbage bag beneath the sink . " No , on the contrary , you were quite thoughtful . I could n't sleep either . I only heard you walking around because I had one of my bad nights . By the way , I had Nadia collect your skirt and blouse . She 's washing them now and she 'll press them as soon as they 're clean . " And if her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A vise starts to tighten around her undigested meal , until she remembers the pants and sweater hanging in Kristin 's closet . They 'll fit her if she needs them . Antonia is only being thoughtful . " Thanks . Can I get you some coffee ? " Antonia smiles . " That will be lovely . Why do n't you join me in the dining room ? " " I 'll be there in a minute . " When Antonia disappears , Valerie dials Russo 's office . " What did you find out about those fingerprints ? " she asks after the detective identifies himself . " So far no match . We did talk to the guy who owns that video store near the subway station . He saw a woman and a child get out of the car . He recognized the driver , said he used the same car ser-  | vice himself sometimes . He verified the driver 's information . The woman carried the child down the steps to the subway entrance and ? " " Detective Russo , do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads , do you ? " She wo n't let him soothe her with irrelevancies , does n't care about empty information . " I still have n't ruled out making some kind of appeal to the public for information . " " You do what you have to , Ms. Vincent . Murchison tell you he thought that would help ? " No , of course he did n't , and Russo knows it . " I 'll talk to you later . I 'll keep talking to you until . . . " What 's the point of saying anything more ? She bangs the phone down , pours two cups of coffee , struggles to recapture the thread of hope she 'd woven last night . As she carries the cups to the marble dining table , she reviews the plan she laid out during the long , bleak hours when she could n't sleep . If Antonia , too , believes it might succeed , then she 'll set it all in motion . " I realized something last night . " Valerie pulls her chair closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Kevin Murchison is right about DASH infecting people all over the country , then surely New York City must have a poisonous little cell of its own . " A skeptical frown creases Antonia 's forehead , but she says noth-ing . " Suppose a woman passed through Montana , say . Maybe this woman met a couple who convinced her that everything from the national health care crisis to high interest rates and tight shoes were plots against decent Americans . Plots perpetrated by worshipers of the devil . Worshipers who use and abuse children in their secret rites . And the couple told this woman about DASH and its mis-sion . " It sounds even better when she says it aloud than it did last night in the isolation of Kristin 's room . " The woman  --  who is she ? Who are these people she met ? I do n't see what you 're getting at . " Antonia does n't seem to share her enthusiasm for the scheme , or maybe it 's just that she does n't understand yet . " Let 's say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the world a safer place for children . Somehow , she gets involved with DASH . This teacher might learn about a pretty child who 's been p 97 taken from her evil mother so her fine , upstanding grandparents can raise her in a good Christian home . She might even find out where the child is . If she can find out where DASH meets . . . " " You ? " Antonia can barely get the word out . She shakes her head furiously . " You ca n't do that . It 's too dangerous . " " It might be . But if I do n't hear from that caller , if the police do n't have any news today , I 'm going to contact DASH . " The coffee in Antonia 's cup is untouched . She rolls the edge of her napkin between her fingers , presses her shoulders against the back of the wheelchair . " This is a foolish idea , Valerie . You ca n't put yourself in harm 's way in order to protect your daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something so risky . " Nadia appears in the doorway , holding two plastic hangers with the shirt and skirt she 'd whisked away to the laundry room earlier . " Here they are , Miss Valerie . All pressed and warm . " She nods mournfully and then vanishes . Good timing . Nadia 's given her an excuse to interrupt what 's beginning to look like a contest of wills with Antonia . " I 'll be back in a few minutes , " Valerie says as she sets her napkin on the table , " as soon as I get dressed . " The overture to Carmen is just ending as Valerie enters the study . Antonia is seated in front of the bay window , hands lying slack against her thighs as though she 's letting the spirited melodies swell in prelude to a dance . Then her head turns toward the doorway and she gestures in the direction of the mahogany writing desk . " Hand me that binder in the top drawer , would you ? The leather one . " Valerie pulls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embossed in gold in the center . Antonia runs her fingers along the first page , a transparent sheet with pockets , like a photo album , except that it 's filled with credit cards . " First thing tomorrow , I want you to go to MaryBeth 's Closet , on Seventh Avenue , next to the pottery store . I 'll call ahead to say it 's all right for you to use my card . If I were your age , I 'd choose something with a little color near the neckline , not too much of course , but young people can carry it off . And while you 're there , you might try on some shoes . Yours sound a bit worn down at the heels . It may  | be dangerously close to a cliche , but plenty of people still believe you can judge a person from their shoes . " " I do n't understand . You want me to buy new clothes ? " Anto-nia 's generosity is touching . Except for the trinkets Johnny surprised her with five or six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gifts , unless it was her birthday or Christmas . " Of course . Whatever you need . All your things are still in the Klein woman 's apartment , are n't they ? So you need new clothes , undergarments , shoes . It gives me pleasure to share what I have with you . " Her smile is broad ; she 's already pleased , it seems , by the very thought of Valerie 's new attire . " Anyway , I want you to be as comfortable as you can at this awful time . Take the card , go to MaryBeth 's tomorrow . When you come back , you can show me your treasures . It will do you good to have a bit of a distraction . " " Thank you , Antonia . That 's really very kind . " Even at the best of times , shopping has been more a necessary chore than a form of recreation . But it wo n't do to appear ungrateful , and she takes the card gently from Antonia 's fingers . Nadia , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm , appears in the doorway . The woman is like a shadow , noiseless , coming and going unexpectedly . Her ruddy face has lost its color and her eyes are tiny brown targets in a sea of white . Valerie knows at once that this is about Joanna . " What is it , Nadia ? " Antonia asks . " I was about to go out and there was a knock on the door . There 's a gentleman here to see ? " Valerie flies from the room to the front foyer , stops mid-stride when she sees him . Impossible . She 's cast her net for him , but the holes have been so big she 's caught nothing . Now he 's standing beside the hall table with his hands stuffed into his pockets . Unmistakably Johnny Starr , even though he 's grown a beard and lost about twenty pounds of whiskey bloat . He 's wearing neat jeans and a dark blue T-shirt , his arms muscled and firm beneath the short sleeves . His skin is n't waxy anymore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just short enough to avoid looking unkempt . He looks like the Johnny she met at Ruth Hoving 's Fourth of July party years ago , older , a bit more uncertain perhaps , definitely sturdier .  | " Valerie , oh , God . " He shakes his head as though he 's trying to wake himself up . Nadia shuffles past them and shuts the door softly behind her . " You still have amazing timing , Johnny . How did you find me ? " she asks finally . " Some NYPD detective , a woman named Gallagher , tracked me down through the painting contractor I work for . She told me what happened to Joanna . And to Esther . I 'm so sorry , Val , I really am . " Someday , hearing Esther 's name wo n't stab at her this way . " And Detective Gallagher told you I was here in Brooklyn ? " Johnny studies the pastel angels perched on an empty candy dish . " Took me a few minutes to realize she thought I had something to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while . Did n't help any that Francine  --  she 's the woman I 'm living with ? ran away and Gallagher kind of picked up that something fishy was going on . Poor Franny thought it was the immigration cops after her . She 's from Belfast , came here on a student visa and never went back . When she heard Gallagher identify herself , she climbed out the window and ran away . She 's staying with a friend , but she 's still afraid to come home . " He runs his hand through his beard and sighs . " Anyway , as soon as Gallagher finished checking me out , I asked about you . But she would n't tell me where you were . " He 's going round and round , not really answering her question . If Teresa Gallagher did n't reveal where she was , who did ? And why did n't Russo tell her they 'd found Johnny ? Maybe they are n't compelled by law to tell her , but that 's not the only measure of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You did n't answer me , Johnny . " How many times in her life has she said that ? But if he hears an echo of the past , Johnny does n't seem to care . " I called Lynn . I figured if anyone on the planet knew where you were , it was Lynn Hammond . She was n't home , and I spoke to one of the boys . Luckily , she 'd written your name and then Antonia Carrera 's just next to it on a piece of paper and stuck it on the refrigerator with a magnet . Mike , Jr. , I think it was . Anyway , he was very proud he figured it out . So here I am . We have to talk , Val . " His story is probably true . Johnny was never good at making things up . Unless that 's another thing that 's different since she last saw him .  | " Let 's not talk here . Wait a minute . I 'll grab my purse and be right back . " Antonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been earlier , near enough to the hallway for her to have overheard that awkward little reunion . From the pinched look on her face , she seems to be working herself up to deliver a speech , one that Valerie does n't have the time to hear . " I have to go out , Antonia . It 's ten-fifteen now . If anyone calls , please tell them I 'll be back by eleven-fifteen . " " Do n't you let him fool you , Valerie . Even when I was your age , I knew that they come back full of apologies and promises , but it never works out the way they say it will . " Antonia is intent on delivering her lecture , like a long-suffering mother addressing a wayward child . She 's composed , unsmiling , absolutely authoritative . " That man out there might know a lot more than he 's saying about what happened Friday night . You 'd be better off not to go anywhere with him , but I know you will so I have one caution . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They sit on a bench , in the weak sunshine that falls between the branches . The cherry blossoms are even lovelier than she 'd imagined , an innocent pink veined with white . Because it 's the first nice Sunday in weeks , the Botanic Garden 's paths are crowded . " So you went to a little trouble to find me . I 'm still not sure why , Johnny . " If he 's expecting her to console him about his daughter being kidnapped , he 's going to have a long wait . She has n't broached the subject of Martha and Lucas yet , has n't even said their names in the twenty minutes it 's taken to walk across the park . " Look , Val . . . I 'm not going to make excuses for myself . I do n't blame you for keeping me at a distance . But there are a couple things I want you to know . I 've been sober for almost ten months , I 've had a decent job since August , and I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hills . " How thoughtful of him to put her through two years of hell in order to straighten himself out . " I 'm glad for you , Johnny , but I have other things on my mind . " " Joanna . Funny . . . I made all those changes for myself , of  | course , but she 's what got me started . I just kept thinking about her all the time , wondering what she looked like , what she was doing . " " We were n't hard to find . At least , not until November . All you had to do was pick up the phone . We could have worked out a visit . Why did n't you call us , write a letter , something ? " She 's mostly successful at keeping the scorn out of her voice . " I had this stupid thought that I would n't be ready until I 'd been clean for a whole year . All that time , I was wondering how I 'd fit into her life . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting yourself set up for a decent future , and I did n't deserve to see her until I could say the same thing . " It actually makes some sense , what he 's saying . She wants to pat his arm , but he 's so stiff she 's afraid he 'd shatter at her touch . " And now this . Maybe if I tried to see you a month ago , she 'd be . . . " His voice trails off . Her heart constricts ; he 's suffering too . She unfolds her hands from her lap , reaches for him . " If I were around , " Johnny says firmly , " this would n't have happened . That 's what fathers do , is n't it , protect the children ? "  | She 's reeling with his words . All she can do is repeat , " Protect the children ? " Johnny hangs his head . " Look , I know I have n't done a thing for her . You 've had the whole burden . And you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messed up to even think about a child . I told you : I did n't want to do anything , to even try to get in touch with you , until I 'd had a year sober and could prove that you could trust me to be part of Joanna 's life . I 've given it a lot of thought , Val , and the thing I see is that the world is full of dangers , risks , traps , big dark holes a kid can fall into . Parents have to teach their kids what those dangers are . I mean , that 's only one part of being a parent but it 's an important one . I ... " While he searches for words , Valerie examines his tidy little speech to see if it 's a smooth gloss to cover up his reference to protecting children . Johnny 's always been transparent , one of his virtues . He lacks guile , so that his feelings , even if they 're childish or vague or magnified by alcohol , are right out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wishes she could stop doing four things at once . Why ca n't she give up trying to figure out what he 's really after , let go  | of her defensiveness , forget the past , and just deal with Joanna 's situation ? " I need you to tell me straight out , Johnny . Are you holding something back ? Did you have anything to do with what 's happened to Joanna ? " He fusses at a bottle cap with the toe of his shoe until it skitters under the bench . " Only in the way I said . That I was n't available to be a real father and take care of my own daughter because I was too drunk or too involved in getting sober and making sure I steered clear of my past  --  you , Taconic Hills , my parents  --  while I was patching my life together . " This is the opening she needs , and she 'd better take advantage of it before he gets too deep into confession and self-pity . " About Martha and Lucas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halloween , her voice sharp with the sting of outrage still undiluted in the telling and retelling of the same story so many times . When she finishes reeling off the list of horrors they planted in her bedroom , Johnny Starr slams his open hand on the seat of the bench . " Sick ! They 're really sick , you know that , even more twisted than I thought . " It 's still there , that short fuse that connects Johnny to Martha and Lucas , that same bright rage . Gently she says , " Maybe they thought I knew how to get in touch with you . They might have figured I 'd try to get you to call them off . Maybe they were worried about what was happening to you and thought they could use me to find you . " " Me . Everything in their lives is because of me . I was always sure it was me , that when my father went off the deep end it was because I did n't do what he expected . He made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit with the grownups because I had n't killed my first deer . Did you know that ? That I had to sit with the little kids , every Thanksgiving , every Christmas , every time the whole family got together , because I would n't shoot a damn deer ? That 's why I never came home for holidays when I was in college . Until we got married . Even my father could n't justify it after that . " Anyway , the last time I spoke to him he said he had a job lined up for me . Working the fields at the Hotaling farm . That I needed to  | do some real work , sweat all the drink out of me , dedicate my life to God instead of to the pleasures of the flesh . All I wanted to do was hit him in his smug , judgmental face , grab my car keys , and roar out of the driveway . " Johnny smiles ruefully . " Not that I had a car . " " So you have n't spoken to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him just after the divorce went through . That was the last time . It was the same old game , my father trying to make me feel guilty because I was upsetting him . I know better now , he ca n't make me feel anything . I do that on my own . And I 'm not the one who sends him into a fury . He does it himself . He chooses to make me the excuse for everything in his life . " Lucas Starr is a master at pushing buttons , and over the years he 's found all of Johnny 's . " Vintage Lucas . He was putting the moves on you to get you to do things his way . " He smiles at her , shy , grateful , it seems , for her understanding . " Val , I do n't want to spend all this time talking about my parents . Joanna 's out there somewhere . The police have n't found her , but maybe there 's something we can do without them . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get it . " Joanna 's disappearance  --  maybe Lucas engineered it to find you . Maybe that 's what your father was after all along . " His head whips around , and he stares at her coldly . Her words hang between them , and she wishes she could snatch them back . The man sitting beside her is neither the old idealistic Johnny she once loved nor the hostile , self-absorbed casualty of alcohol he became . He could be a messenger sent by Martha and Lucas , part of a Byzantine conspiracy so convoluted she feels herself getting lost . " He 's capable of that , is n't he ? " The little jagged moon of white paint at the base of his thumbnail disappears as he runs his fingers through his beard . " I 'm going to call him , feel him out . " That had been her intention , until the answering machine cut her short . If she tells Johnny about the anonymous call , he can monitor Lucas 's reaction . He can talk about protecting the children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indignant protest-toomuch tone that would indicate he 'd rattled Lucas . p 105 Except that Johnny might decide to call the police , and the caller might find out somehow and carry out his threat to harm Joanna . " You sure you can handle talking to Lucas without becoming that gangly , uncomfortable boy again ? " She hears the cruelty of doubt in her own voice . " I can do it . I know what 's important here . " His eyes lock onto hers . " I need you to trust me , Val . " " Trust you ? Based on one hour of repentance ? I do n't have time to conduct a character investigation . I have to find Joanna . " There 's the little matter of Esther 's murder attached to the question of what happened to Joanna , but he seems to have forgotten that . He rises from the bench and heads down the path toward the tulips , which make a splashy pink and white show around the edges of a fountain . His shoulders slump and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a child who just lost a baseball game . She 's curiously detached . She wants only one thing from Johnny Starr . If he ca n't  --  or wo n't  --  deliver , she 'll find another way to get to Martha and Lucas . When he heads back to her , his eyes are red but his shoulders are straight , his head erect . " Come on , Val . You 're asking me to prove to you in an hour that I want to find Joanna too , " he says as he lowers himself to the bench . " I used to think getting sober was the hardest thing I 'd ever do . " You have to tell me now if you 're willing to do whatever it takes . Because if you 're not , we do n't have much to talk about . " This time , she 's the one who gets up , walks toward the fountain glittering with the reflections of the pennies that line the bottom , a copper mosaic of wishes . Make a wish , toss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it happen . That 's more like it . She does n't hear the footsteps behind her , is only aware of the heat of his body close to hers . " Anything . " Johnny grips her shoulders and she tenses , a signal that he 's on dangerous ground if he tries to touch her more intimately . " I 'll do anything , Val , and if you 're thinking that when it 's over I 'll try to take Joanna away from you , do n't . You do n't have to worry about that from me . Martha and Lucas , maybe , but not me . I  | wish it could have been the way we dreamed , Val , but I messed up , and now I have to try to fix it . " She wants to believe him . " You 're willing to call your father ? You 're ready to come with me to the nearest pay phone and find out what Lucas has to say about Joanna ? " Why should she expect him to be more loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-wife who threw him out than he is to his own parents , even though he 's aware of their manipulations , their selfserving righteousness ? On the other hand , he has changed  --  even his walk is different , looser , as though he 's more at ease in his own body . Still , she 's been hurt too many times trying to predict what Johnny would do . When he nods his agreement and reaches for her hand , she 's shocked at how easy the fit is , how comforting the contact . " Let 's go , then , " she says , moving out of his reach and heading toward the heavy gates that lead to the street . " Before either of us changes our mind . "  | " No , Martha , you 've got to enter the password to get into the bulletin board . You ca n't just sign on . It 's not magic , you know . A computer is a fool piece of equipment with wires and electricity and it only does what you tell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again with those big eyes asking for forgiveness . She 'd done this , what , thirty times for sure , and she knew . Martha was nervous today , still upset by that snooping visit from Riley Hamm , but she had to remember to keep her head . " There . " She swiveled in her chair and looked up , imploring him for approval . Well , she 'd earned it this time . " Good . Now go right to the new posting , the one just below the calendar of events . " The blinking cursor skated to the bottom of the screen . " What 's the matter with you today , Martha ? Go ahead , we need to get to where it says Operation Safe Haven . " Nodding , she hit a key and moved to the listing . " Now we want to open that file , right ? " Well , what did she think they were doing all this for , fun ? Before he could answer , the phone rang . " Forget that . You go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out exactly like you see it on the ? " The noise of the damn phone was like a dentist 's drill in his head .  | " I know , Lucas . I remember . " He stalked out of the room , ready to pull the contraption out of the kitchen wall and be done with it , but he waited for the answering machine to announce that he could n't come to the phone right now , waited to see if Miss High-and-Mighty Valerie would try again to get him to call her , the way she did yesterday . Leaving a fool message on his machine  --  and expecting him to hurry up and call her . " Dad ? It 's me . Johnny . If you 're there , please pick up . It 's Johnny , Dad . " That was fast . Miss Valerie must have figured out a way to get in touch with him . Would n't be a big surprise if she 'd known all along where John was . Lucas yanked the receiver off the hook . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booth in Brooklyn . How are you ? How 's Mom ? " Lucas snorted . " If you cared , you'da been in touch before now . Let 's not make small talk , son . Why 'd you call ? " " I 'm trying to find out what happened , Dad . With Joanna . You know anything about that ? " " I 'll tell you the same thing I told Riley Hamm . Why does n't her mother know where she is , that 's the real question . Her and that Carrera woman she 's staying with , I bet they 're at the bottom of this whole thing . " Maybe he 'd gone too far with that one . He had to be more careful . John 's voice was like a finger pointing across the telephone lines . " You 've spoken to Valerie about this ? " Was he slurring his words ? If John were standing right in front of him , Lucas knew he 'd be able to tell just by looking at his son 's eyes whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell , the stink of his breath , or whether he could put three words together without getting sloppy . It was those eyelids , half closed like he wanted to shut the world out , that gave him away . And gave Lucas the willies , seeing his son near out of his mind with drink . Boy needed to take himself back to church and get some teachings . He was going to plant whatever seeds the good Lord handed him and make sure this time they grew right . " I have n't spoken to that woman in months . Where are you ? You think you can just call here out of the blue and get what you want without any single word of explanation , you got another think com-  | ing . " No need to scare the boy off completely . He needed to be firm enough so his message got across , but he had to make John understand his father was n't some unfeeling monster . " We 've been real worried about you . Your mother prays to God every night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back . Where you been , John ? What have you been doing ? " " I 've been in the city . New York . We can talk about me some other time . I want to know if you know anything about Joanna . About her disappearance . " This was what they 'd been warned to expect . No one understanding , everyone accusing , just because they could n't find the way to God in their own lives . But John was doing exactly right now , asking after his own child , finally showing a little spine , taking some responsibility for his own life . Still , he 'd played , so now he 'd better be ready to pay . " Maybe I do and maybe I do n't . We can talk about that when you come up here . Maybe I can help you get your daughter back but you have to do something first . You know , you 've been in what I 'd call a skid , John . You prove yourself to me first . Quit drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What should he say ? Six months ? No , that was too long , too risky . " Three months , say , and you go to church , too . I know you 're a good boy at heart . Maybe this is all you need , a shock to your system to break you out of those habits you fell into after you married her . " " This is n't going to work , Dad . It 's blackmail . I 'm not going to let you do that to me . " Total calm . The boy had total control , did n't even raise his voice . A flicker of anger licked at Lucas 's gut . " Then we got nothing to talk about , do we ? " " I 'd say we had a lot to talk about . Like what happened at Vale-rie 's on Halloween . Like where my daughter is . " The old John would have been sputtering into the phone , sounding all indignant , the way he used to when he was ten and Martha would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been hard for that boy to accept that God and man had given the world rules to keep things running smooth . Maybe John knew more than he was saying . But if he thought he could change everything with a single phone call . . . " You 're making a big mistake , lots of them . Besides , that 's not  | the subject here , John . You 're really paining your mother , you know that , do n't you ? " Lucas turned to see Martha , standing with her arms crossed under her breasts and watching him with a confused look on her face . " Now , you think about what I said . I 'll call you in a couple of days to get your answer . What 's your number ? " Martha handed him a pencil , then reached out for the phone . " Is that John ? Oh , Lucas , let me talk to him . " He waved her away . " I did n't catch that . What did you say ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joanna . You know where she is , do n't you ? Dad , if anything happens to her ? " " You trying to say something , John ? Because unless you can come up with a good reason for me to stand here and listen to your accusations , I have better things to do . " That ought to be clear enough . " She 's a baby , you know , Dad ? " John was still talking in that spooky , quiet voice . " I want you to tell me where she is . She 's just a kid . She ca n't argue her own case and tell anyone what she wants . It 's up to the adults in her life to protect her . " Lucas started to break the connection but his hands were trembling . Did John know what he was saying ? Could n't let him think he 'd hit his mark , had to say something . He cleared his throat . " You would n't know a thing about protecting children , mister . If you cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her . Now do n't call here again , you hear me ? Unless you 're ready to stop these accusations and talk civilized . " Now he did slam the receiver back into the cradle . Lucas Starr was not about to stand around and listen to all that bull piss , and from his own son , too . He had to report in to George Perry in New Jersey . And Martha better not start her snuffling and whining . He was in no mood for that .  | If only he would stop looking at her , she could manage to finish her meal without feeling like some exotic creature in a glass cage . " The coffee is particularly strong , darling . Would you like some cream to take the edge off ? " Charles Babcock 's voice , barely audible above the polite chatter at nearby tables , trembled with adolescent shyness . He held the silver pitcher as though it were an offering , incontrovertible proof of the depth of his devotion . Kristin shook her head , swallowed the bitter coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush her cheek with his warm , dry lips . " You seem tired , darling . We can skip the party tonight , if you like . Is your throat bothering you again ? " So solicitous , all that concern flooding his eyes . And he was handsome , even with his forehead wrinkled in worry . What was the matter with her , anyway , that she could n't simply accept his love and delight in the pampering ? " I feel much better , Charles . " She tried on a brighter smile . " No , even if it 's just for a little while , it 's important we show up at the party . Berger and Rienzi will be there . The last two holdouts on the board . You still want to convince them that the merger is a good idea , right ? It struck me last night that they 're both heavily involved  | You can show them how the technology you 'll be developing in the new company will benefit them . By providing them with capacity to store the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocols , for example . " She 'd been mulling over the problem , intrigued by the challenge of selling two smart men on a completely unnecessary change that would consolidate Charles 's power on the board of directors . Kristin took a sip of water from the crystal goblet ; she had more to say , much more . " Your throat is bothering you , " Charles said , frowning . " I promise we 'll leave early . I 'll have you home by ten . " " I feel fine , " she snapped . " I told you that . " She would n't explain , for the hundredth time , how much difference it would make if he would truly listen to her . Perhaps if he allowed himself to discuss actual ideas with her , the ending of their story might be more to his liking . He peered at her over his glasses . " I hope you 're not still upset over our canceled vacation . Because I 'm not , not in the slightest . Aruba is no fun if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the casinos . Of course it made no sense to go if you were n't feeling well . " God , what accounted for the changes in men like Charles when they fell in love ? What sapped their intelligence , drained away their strength of will , the sense of purpose that made them captains of industry and champions of the current ruthless version of democ-racy ? " Honestly , Charles , I 'm much better , " she insisted . He graced her with his aristocratic , thin-lipped smile , equal parts victory and disbelief at his good fortune in being with her . " We have a lifetime of vacations to look forward to , anyway . I hope it 's not this thing with Antonia that 's bothering you . " Kristin searched his face . " This thing with Antonia ? " " She called me at the office to ask if you 'd gone away after all . Said she 'd left several messages on your answering machine to thank you for taking care of the errand she 'd sent you on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits , Kristin . You can not allow her to go on thinking of you as an employee at her beck and call . Now , if you want me to say something to her on your behalf I 'll ? " " Ssh , Charles . Do n't worry about Antonia . She needed a favor  | and I was glad to do it . I do n't expect she 'll get confused about who I am to her . We 're both perfectly clear about how much our relationship has changed . " Kristin smoothed her skirt . " Charles , you 're staring . I 'm going to the ladies ' room . Be right back . " " I 'll miss you , " he said , clutching her hand a little too tightly before he released her and sat back against the plush banquette . Kristin rewarded his restraint with a smile , wriggled away from the table , and threaded her way between the damask-draped tables through the bustling restaurant . That smile was about all he was going to get from her tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong : acting the part had n't made her sufficiently fond of Charles Babcock . If only she could convince herself to love this man who courted her with expensive presents and trips to lazy , sun-kissed islands . . . Maybe it had worked that way for all the other women Antonia had managed to marry off . For Kristin , the pretense had never been transformed , by magic or by will , into truth . The ladies ' room attendant smiled listlessly when Kristin walked in . " If you need anything , just let me know , " she said , nodding to the array of creams and cosmetics on the marble counter before she resumed staring at her hands . Kristin yanked a tissue from the plastic holder , blotted the shine on her nose , dusted her cheeks with powder . Beneath all his polish , at least Charles Babcock was a decent man . Antonia , however , was a different story . That was outrageous , calling Charles at his office . Charles should n't be the one to do it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand she could n't have it both ways . She 'd been the one to declare the old agreement void . For all those years in the brownstone across from Prospect Park , Kristin had thought of herself as a sailor charting a life course that responded to even the slightest change in the elements . Antonia had been the tide and the wind . But she 'd become a raging hurricane when Kristin said she planned to decline Charles 's proposal . You must marry him to ensure your future . You 're nearly thirty , you know . As though thirty were some magic number , and her discomfort  | with his fawning attention was of no consequence . She did appreciate his decency , his reserve , the tasteful , carefully chosen objects with which he surrounded himself . But she was going to decline , with regret and with the hope that they might continue their friendship , she 'd told Antonia , because she did n't love Charles Babcock . Love . Antonia 's voice had turned cold as she described how she fell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet who had run away from the family farm in Kansas , seeking the spirit of Walt Whitman in Brooklyn , finding Antonia instead in front of one of the used-book stalls outside the Strand . Ten months later , convinced that her passion for Willard was destined to die a little at a time and leave her impoverished in soul and bank account , Antonia had married Miguel Carrera , whose family owned coffee plantations in three South American countries . Even that first year , it was clear that , other flaws aside , Miguel Carrera drank imported Russian vodka prodigiously , expansively , as he did everything . Kept drinking for six years . Had been drinking since noon and all through the afternoon of the winter day he ordered his pregnant young wife into the car , drove to the airfield , and declared that they were going to Montreal for dinner . He loved his twin-engine plane , which he flew into a snowy mountain in Vermont , killing himself and their unborn child , and rendering Anto-nia 's eyes useless and her legs paralyzed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd learned a lot in those years , some of which Antonia had taught her , none of which made it quite clear what exactly she should be doing to turn this mess around .  | When Johnny leaves her to return to Manhattan , she slips into character , tries it on to see what fits and what might need alteration . Crossing the park , she practices walking , thinking , reacting the way she would . She 'll become that schoolteacher making inquiries about DASH , anxious to ally herself with an organization that cares deeply about children . It 's only a small step from the truth . Maybe she wo n't have to go that far , if Johnny can convince his parents to share their secrets . She 's fumbling in the bottom of her purse for the key when a cat bounds across her path and lands in a profusion of tulips blooming in a small patch of dirt surrounded by a fence of iron fleur-de-lis , the spearlike points protecting the tiny yard next door . Brilliant reds and yellows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds in a topless cage , and she wishes she could watch them fly away into the sky . " That 's better . " Startled , she turns to see the young man who scolded her the other day for not being cheerful enough to suit him . He 's wearing a brown uniform and toting a small carton on one shoulder ; a clipboard dangles from his other hand . " They look like parrots , do n't they ? " She puts the key in the  | lock , feeling for the right fit , then turns around , aware that the young man 's still standing behind her on the street . " Can I help you with something ? " " This is for Kristin Denby . " He taps the label on the carton . " I know she does n't live here anymore , but I was passing by and I remembered about this package . I mean , it 's Sunday and all , but I was right here . Anyway , I wonder if Mrs. Carrera wants to accept the package or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or should I just send it back to Bloomingdale 's ? " " I 'll take it . " She rests the clipboard against the box and scrawls her signature in the space he indicates with his pen . " So now I know your name . Nice to meet you , Valerie . . what does this say ? " She 's already written it , line fourteen , just as he requested . There 's no harm in saying it aloud , certainly . " Valerie Vincent . " " I 'm Cameron Zax . My real name and my stage name . I 'm studying what it 's like to be a UPS driver for this great role in a new play that 's opening on Broadway in ? " He frowns and backs away , then offers her his hand . " I 'm one of the lucky ones  --  an actor with a day job . Listen , I 'm sorry for ragging you the other day about not smiling . That was really out of line . Anyway , I 'll just leave this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And not too many promises to keep , I hope . " A normal exchange , amazing . A conversation , however brief , that 's not loaded with the possibility of danger or hope . " Apology accepted . " He skips down the steps , half running to his van as though he 's excited about whatever adventure the next stop will bring . Nice to know someone still feels that way . She pushes the door open and sets the package on the table in the hall . " There you are , Valerie . " Antonia whirs into the doorway . " I expected you twenty minutes ago . " " I guess I walked the long way . " To give herself time alone , to think without anyone asking questions about her daughter or her past , to be where she might see trees and flowers , even if they 're shrouded in the soot the city spews in great clouds over everything . " There 's a package in the hall . For Kristin . Maybe I should call her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloomingdale's. " p 117 " No need . " Her hand drifts to her forehead in a gesture that 's the first sign of one of Antonia 's headaches . " She phones me often . Prenuptial jitters , although I do n't understand why . Charles Babcock is such a lovely man . I 'll tell her about the package the next time she calls . " " Any calls for me ? " Valerie knows the answer , realizes she does n't really have to ask . " Of course not . I would have told you right away , would n't I , my dear ? Tell me about your walk . " What she 's really asking about is her time with Johnny . How close to the mark was the warning that he might know about what happened Friday night , that 's what Antonia really wants to know . " I do n't think Johnny has a clue about Joanna 's disappearance , Antonia . And I 'm pretty sure he has n't spoken to his parents in a very long time . We called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they knew anything about Joanna 's kidnapping . But they just stonewalled . " " Did you ask him about that awful telephone call ? " " No , I decided . . . That 's wrong . I have n't really decided anything . Maybe the call is some kind of test , to see whether I can be trusted . I 'm still not sure what I should do about it . " The pearls at her throat glimmer with pink lights as Antonia shifts in her chair . " I 'd say you 've made a decision , and a wise one . To do nothing . To wait for further contact . Tell me , my dear , have the police said whether you can go back to the Klein woman 's apart-ment ? " " Not as long as they consider it a crime scene . " Antonia sighs . " Well , let me know , will you ? I 'll arrange for Carl to go with you . You 'll need a car to collect your things and Joanna 's and bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine you have quite a bit of ? " " We wo n't be staying here , Antonia . I just want to find my daughter and take her back home to Taconic Hills . In fact , " she adds gently , " maybe you should start looking for someone else . I could call an agency and you can start interviewing ... " Shallow little breaths lift Antonia 's chest . " I 've got Nadia for emergencies . You 're in no state to make such a decision . I refuse to make plans that involve your leaving . This is your home , Valerie . "  | Antonia simply wo n't hear what she 's saying . " And I do hope you 've abandoned that foolish idea you told me about this morning , Valerie . " Foolish ? Maybe it 's risky , but DASH still looks like her best hope for finding Joanna . At least it 's something to do . " No . No , I 'm pursuing it . I have to . Can I get you something for your headache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " She says it softly , as though she 's asking Nadia for more coffee . After each word , a pause that 's long enough to indicate the control is hard-won , or perhaps it 's an underscoring of her displeasure . " You 're emotionally vulnerable now , and even if you were n't , from everything you 've said these people wo n't be easy to fool . If they discover that you 've tricked them . . . You must n't do this . " " And I ca n't sit around and do nothing ! It 's my daughter 's life , Antonia . I have to do what I can . " She runs out of the room , trembling with anger , ignoring Antonia 's voice as it follows her up the stairs calling her name . By the time she 's splashed cold water on her face , she knows what she 'll say when she goes downstairs to apologize for her outburst . I 'm just not used to the idea that someone in my life cares so much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my actions . I did n't mean to shout at you that way . But she 'll say it later , when she 's sure she wo n't erupt again . After the jitters are gone and the impulse to slam doors has died . After she 's called Kevin Murchison . He answers on- the second ring . " Mr. Murchison , it 's Valerie Vincent . " " Hey , it 's Kevin , all right ? " " All right , Kevin . Do you have a few minutes ? I need a little information . DASH must have meetings here in the city , right ? " She lays out her plan . She 'll be a teacher devoted to saving children . A woman haunted by her encounter with a group of Satan-worshipers when she was a child . A person the members of DASH will trust with information about rescued children . " I 'm glad I took your advice and stayed away from the press , " she says finally . " Nobody will connect me to Joanna , nobody will know  | who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where these people get together next ? " His long silence is broken by a gust of laughter . " I 'm sorry , Ms. Valerie Vincent , but I 'm laughing at myself . I 've been crazy to get into one of their meetings but they know me , and it 's impossible . And you propose to go in there , when it 's the last thing in the world you 'd choose to do on your average weekday evening . But if anyone I 've met in the past eight years has the brains and the cojones to pull this off , I do believe it 's you . " " So where do they meet ? " she demands . " You 're not up to that yet . First problem is you 're missing a husband . A single woman will trip their alarms . I ca n't be your husband because they know me . Mitch Russo ca n't do it because he 's been in the papers a couple of times in the past three , four years . You have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely trust ? " Her laugh is bitter . " Is there anyone in the world you feel that way about ? " Johnny . How clever of him to show up just now . How perfect , confronting his parents on the phone while she was standing beside him . Too clever , maybe . Too perfect ? Her mind races with other possibilities , Peter Hoving , Mike Hammond , Paul Cooper , but it 's not like asking someone to mail a letter for you on their way to the supermarket . " I 'll have to think about it . " " I ca n't help you out on that one . All I can tell you is it 's critical you have a man with you . Who he is is up to you . " " Okay , assume I have someone . " One thing at a time . It will come to her , the answer is waiting for her to find it . " What else ? " " You have to look like you 're about to step into a church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Cleopatra eye makeup . Conservative . Totally untrendy . You know what I mean . I better check the time of their next meeting , but unless they changed it , it 's this Tuesday . Second Tuesday of the month . You do understand that you could be in real danger if you 're discovered , do n't you ? This is not some game of dress-up you 're playing here . " She 's already gone over that , had the risks pointed out to her , no , shouted at her , by Antonia . " I 'll take my chances . I have to find Joanna . So , if I do get myself a husband , does my story work ? I can  | say I found out about DASH from those people in Montana , the Murphy family . " " Tell them you heard about DASH from a friend of the Murphys ' . I remember someone , Kitty Stevens . Say she told you about Operation Safe Haven when you were passing through Montana four years ago . And she also told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hang on , I have to check something . " Maybe Peter Hoving would be the right choice . Peter 's smart , steady , will never tell anyone except Sarah . And it 's not fair to ask him to risk exposing himself to DASH . " Okay , yeah , they still put their notices on the back page of the Village Voice . Ironic , right ? All those old-time liberals would crap hammers and sickles if they knew what DASH was . The next meeting is day after tomorrow . There 's one in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn . You think you can be ready by then ? If you do n't get this together  --  husband , clothes , everything  --  do n't do it , Valerie . " It 's the first time he 's used her name , and she feels somehow safer . " I 'll be ready , " she says firmly . " Is there an address in that notice ? " " Here 's what 's going to happen . You 'll call the number in the ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message telling you when to call back . They 'll ask you a bunch of questions about how you heard about them , what you believe , and they 'll tell you where to go . It 's a different place each month . They do n't encourage drop-ins . You got all that ? " " I guess . And you 're sure I ca n't do this alone ? " " Absolutely . Things might move very quickly , and you do n't want to be caught short . Do n't even pretend you know anything about DASH except they 're concerned about the welfare of children . Play dumb . I know that 's a stretch but try anyway . " She laughs as she hangs up . Her hand is still on the receiver when the phone rings . Her caller ? She snatches it up , says hello at the same moment Antonia does . " Valerie ? It 's me . Johnny . " She hears a soft click as Antonia breaks the connection . " Do you have a minute ? " Johnny Starr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . About my father . Maybe he wo n't try his  | snort-and-bellow routine if I 'm right in his face . I can pick you up in half an hour . " " You want me to go to Taconic Hills with you ? " A two-hour drive up , two hours back . Time enough to tell him about DASH , to brief him on the story they 'll both have to have down cold , no flaws , no missing pieces . " I 'll be ready . Half an hour . "  | The only conversation has been about Joanna . Johnny has asked a few questions , and she 's answered him , but mostly they 've watched the landscape change . As they 've gotten farther from the city , the yards have grown more spacious , the trees denser , and the silence thicker . The sun is dipping toward the far hills ; they want to get to War-ren 's Rock Road before Martha and Lucas sit down to dinner , which they surely still do at exactly six every evening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows , an old Ford with enough dings and quirks to look as though it 's done its fair share of country work . She 's borrowed a little hope from her own shrinking supply . They 're well into Dutchess County , flying up the Taconic State Parkway , only five minutes from the Pine Plains exit that will bring them to the road to Taconic Hills , when Johnny says , " You really think my parents are clever enough to kidnap Joanna and figure out a way to hide her from the police ? " It 's time for him to know . She ca n't tell him about the phone call , not yet . And she wo n't mention the meeting until she 's sure he can be trusted . Lucas and  | Martha are n't the only ones whose reaction she 'll be watching this evening . This little jaunt to the country will be a test of another sort , one that experience has taught her Johnny might fail . In which case she 'll have to find someone else to stand beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choses her words carefully , remembering Kevin Murchison 's warnings . She tells him about DASH , careful to give him only as much information as she thinks he needs to know . " I do n't get it . These DASH people snatch kids out of their homes ? Because they think their parents are going to turn them into some kind of Satanic robots ? " He 's incredulous -- or , at least , he 's very convincing . " I 'll show you the articles if you do n't believe me . Kevin Murchi-son 's been writing about them for years . " " This Murchison  --  maybe he 's exaggerating , you know , to make a better story . I never read ? " And then he stops , mouth agape , and turns to her . " You think my mother and father . . . " " I do n't know , Johnny . Maybe . They could be . But we ca n't accuse them . We have to be careful . Murchison says when these people smell exposure they 're even slicker about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes fixed on the road . She should have told him sooner . He has less than ten miles to absorb the facts about DASH ; she 's had days , entire nights , to let the idea sink in . Rolling fields slip by , green streaks splashed against the blur of cloudless sky . When a sprawling white farmhouse winks from behind a stand of tamarack pines , the threat of tears pricks her eyes . Martha and Lucas Starr took so much away from her , and she 's angry at herself for letting it happen . Johnny glances away from the road to look at her , and she shifts in her seat , her back to him as she peers out the side window . " What ? " he says , still watching her when she turns to meet his gaze . " I miss it here . I could n't let myself think about it while I was trying to get my paper done , and now . . . well , I have n't thought about anything much except Joanna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized . I feel so stupid . Crying about scenery , of all  | things . " The tears are real , her face is damp with them , and she wishes she had n't done this now . He reaches across the seat , the way he used to for no reason at all ; his hand stops just short of touching her . She wants to comfort him , but she ca n't let him use this terrible situation to erase the mistakes of his past with a loving gesture . " You think you 'd like to come back here ? When this is all settled , I mean . " He grasps the steering wheel again ; he 's been looking at her instead of the road for too long . " Yes . I do n't know if it will be Taconic Hills exactly , but somewhere nearby . " If moving back here means having Martha and Lucas for neighbors , she 'll find another town . But , yes , her heart is here , where she can let winter coerce her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the sun has disappeared behind the tired old mountains to the west . No need to ask him if he plans to return to his ancestral home . The answer is obvious . It 's right for him to be in a city . Funny , she has n't recognized until now that his paintings throb with city colors . Even before he went to Manhattan , his basic palette of grays and blacks , shot through with those red or white or yellow slices of pure energy , vibrated with a kinetic power that 's missing in Taconic Hills . When they reach the intersection that marks the center of Pine Plains , she 's assailed by doubt . " Hold on , Johnny . Pull over and let me make a quick phone call , okay ? " The light changes . As he slips the truck into first gear , he looks down at his watch . " It 's five-thirty . " " I know . I wo n't be long . I just want to call Antonia and tell her I wo n't be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there 's been another call . And I want to postpone what 's coming . She gathers enough change to make the long-distance call as the truck lurches into the parking lot of Peck 's Market . Johnny pulls into a spot near the store entrance , and she hops down to the blacktop , runs to the pay phone , dials and tosses the coins hurriedly down the slot . From the cab of the truck , Johnny watches a young man with two school-age children as they head into the store , but she ca n't tell from his face whether he 's feeling longing or contempt or recognition .  | When Antonia answers , she says , " It 's Valerie . I 'm out with Johnny . I did n't want you to worry . I 'm not exactly sure when I 'll be back but it might be as late as ten . " " I 'm not keeping track , my dear . You come and go as you must . I 'll see you in the morning . " Then a click , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's clear from her voice . There was n't even time in that terse exchange to ask whether any calls have come in , but Antonia surely would have said so , would n't have hung up so quickly if the anonymous caller had made a second contact . The truck idles noisily ; she climbs into the cab , and Johnny pulls onto the road behind a station wagon piled with kids and groceries . " You ca n't even say the name of this group to your parents , okay , Johnny ? " He does n't answer . She almost asks him to turn back , forget the whole thing . But it 's too late . He knows about DASH , knows the dangers . She told him because she believed he would want to protect his daughter , and now she has to see this confrontation through . She ca n't control Johnny Starr ; she can only pray that she was right to trust him . She barely notices when they pass the Taconic Hills General Store and the Historical Society building , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taconic Journal , squints with open curiosity at the truck as they drive by . When they pull into the driveway of the Starrs ' white frame house , she 's calm . Like a camera , she 's going to record in her mind everything she sees , everything she hears them say or not say . The boxy Cape Cod sits on a hillock of green . The colonial blue of the shutters has faded a little , but the leaning oak that shades the living room tilts at the same funny angle , and the hedge beside the path leading to the front door has been kept trimmed so that it 's still exactly three feet tall . Even the white sheets and towels on the line in the back look as though they might have been hanging there the day she left . Before Johnny 's out of the truck , Martha appears in the doorway , her ample body blocking the entrance to her home . Her face registers first confusion , then surprise , then the delight that Valerie has dreamed about in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again after she thought that might never happen . " Johnny ! " Martha 's found her voice , but she ca n't seem to move .  | Her hands are thrust into the pockets of the yellow checked apron she 's wearing atop a shapeless , colorless dress . And then Lucas is standing beside his wife , and the twilight turns steely . He elbows Martha out of the way , then spreads his legs wide and plants his hands on his hips . " What 's she doing here ? " She 's here to uncover secrets . Valerie pushes open the door and hops out onto the gravel , returning his glower with a curt nod . Johnny has come around the truck to stand next to her , his shoulder touching hers . " Can we come inside ? " he asks , his voice controlled , neutral , eerily casual . " You can come inside if you 're ready to reconsider what we talked about this morning . " His face an alarming red , Lucas shakes off Martha 's hand on his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we better do our business here . " Johnny takes one step and then another , gravel crackling under the hard soles of his city shoes . Martha does n't seem able to move . They 're not responding to Johnny , but maybe that 's because he has n't said anything provocative . " This is ridiculous . Johnny and I are here to talk about Joanna . " Not yet . She ca n't say the words until she 's close enough to see every twitch of a reaction . " Nothing to talk about . " Lucas holds his position in front of his wife , as though he has to shield her from the horrible menace in the yard . How do you engage an adversary who refuses to admit there 's a war going on ? She thinks about flamethrowers or bombs , signals that Lucas and Martha would n't be able to ignore . Maybe they 'll have to practice a little guerrilla warfare .. . Johnny advances another step toward the battleground , hands in his pockets . " Yes , we do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's about to say something when Johnny reaches back for her hand and squeezes it . She understands  --  he wants to take the lead . That 's what Lucas will expect , that 's what he 'll want , and she 'd be foolish to disturb the tension that 's strung between her ex-husband and his parents , drawing them closer in painfully small steps .  | " You got that one right , mister . But you do n't want to do that now , do you ? You do n't want to talk about coming back to the Lord 's path . So , the way I see it , we got squat to talk about . " " I ca n't let you do that , Dad . You ca n't turn this into something that 's about me . Valerie 's right . This is about Joanna . Joanna is missing . A woman 's dead . I 'm not saying you 're responsible , but I get the feeling you know more than you 're letting on . " Lucas gives no indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the oak tree only straighter , no bend , no tilt , as though his feet have suddenly grown roots that go down so deep he 'll never move , even in a gale . Johnny lets go of her hand . He strides the last couple of steps that separate him from the two people in the doorway . If he ca n't control the rage that 's making his gait so stiff . . . but he passes Lucas and wraps his arms around Martha and presses his face against hers . Lucas pounces . Both hands on Johnny 's shoulders , he yanks his son away . " You stop that ! Your tricks are n't going to do you no good ! " Martha is frozen , bewildered . It 's up to Johnny ; he 's the key . For a moment Valerie 's sure he 's going to swing his clenched fist at Lucas but his hand drops and he takes a step back . " I 'm sorry , Mom . " His voice is soft , and he reaches for Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the pain I 've caused you . " " Oh , Johnny . " Martha swipes at her eyes , her cheeks wet with streaming tears . " Just tell him you 're going to go to church . That 's all he wants . " Johnny shakes his head . " I ca n't . I ca n't lie . That 's not what I 'm going to do . That 's not the only way for me to serve what 's right and good . Where 's Joanna , Mom ? Where is she ? " Lucas bounds down the steps and heads for the truck . Directly for Valerie . He 's not going to provoke her into doing something she 'll regret ? but she wo n't allow him to run her down , either . " What 're you doing here ? " Circles of white rim his dark pupils , his nostrils flare , his mouth quivers with fury . " I thought you were out of his life for good . "  | Now . " We 're here because it 's our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops to her mouth and her eyes widen . She pulls the screen door open and stumbles inside . " What are you talking about ? " Lucas thrusts his face closer . " You think letting your child get taken away is protecting her ? You think you protected my child by driving him to drink ? " " Tell me where my daughter is . " It 's a kind of trance , she knows it , and she 's glad , because it allows her to stay in the same spot , to speak without shouting Joanna 's name or Esther 's . She ca n't tell , she just ca n't tell what those words and that burning stare mean . " If you'da done your job right , if you'da paid attention , she would n't be gone . " Johnny 's father whirls around and stalks back to the stairs . His words are like a knife . " It 's her fault  --  that dead woman , Joanna , all of it . If only ? " " Do n't talk to her like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping him from going back into the house . Martha is only a shadow behind the screen door as the two men face off . Johnny 's voice edges into a shout . " You ca n't bully people into doing what you want . You ca n't trick them into godliness . It does n't work that way . " And then he walks away . Lucas stares after Johnny , openmouthed . " John Starr ! John , you come back here . John Matthew Starr ! " His head whips around as Martha pushes open the door and reaches for his arm , but he brushes her away and starts down the stairs . " You ungrateful , unholy sonofabitch . You come back here ! " By the time Lucas stomps to the gravel drive , Johnny has started the truck and Valerie is rolling up the window . As they pull onto the blacktop road , she can see Martha in the rearview mirror , sagging against the doorframe , her face slick with tears . Alone in the driveway , Lucas raises his fist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown into sharp spikes by the soft spring wind .  | The voices rise furiously , two women hurling accusations that the other is lying , has always lied , can never be trusted . A few minutes before nine and Antonia is at it again after a twoday silence , tuned to the hype-and-heartbreak on the television in her bedroom , where Nadia has just deposited a breakfast tray . How can she bear to listen to all that wretchedness so early in the day ? Valerie blocks out the noise , retraces her own thoughts , remem-bers . They 're going to do it . Yesterday 's telephone call to DASH went well ; tomorrow night , she and Johnny will smile and bow and scrape and lull the people at that meeting into telling them about Joanna . Surely one evening with DASH will turn up more than the " hundreds of man-hours " Russo said the police have put in on the case . He 'd dragged out that figure to try to placate her this morning when she phoned for an update . Was Russo including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . still have no suspects in the murder of Esther Klein . " She races down the hall to Antonia 's room , listening for Joanna 's name , but the volume has been turned down . " Did they mention Joanna ? " Her daughter 's name lodges in her throat .  | Frowning , Antonia nudges her dark glasses , fusses with the pillow behind her head . " No , not a word . I must say , I find it odd . Does n't your detective think it will be easier to find your daughter if they make more of it in news broadcasts ? " Relief or disappointment : Valerie is n't sure what she feels about Russo 's continued silence to the media . She explains Murchison 's theory to Antonia as the bright voice of the weather forecaster promises sunshine . " Part of me still wants to see her face plastered all over the news . Maybe it would help . " " They 're the experts . You must have faith in that . " Even though Antonia has raised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sympathy is unmistakable , welcome after that argument the day before . Impulsively Valerie says , " I 'm sorry , Antonia . It was terribly rude of me to blow up at you yesterday morning . I 've been so ? " " Shh . Please . Do n't do this to me . " So , she 's not even going to let her finish , is so upset and insulted that the gap between them ca n't be closed . But Antonia points the remote control at the television , clicks it off , and turns toward Valerie . " I 'm the one who must apologize . You 're under such strain , and then I make it more difficult by arguing with you . I 'm so very sorry , my dear . It 's just that I ca n't bear the thought of anything happening to you . I do n't know what I 'd do if ... Please forgive me . " A thick lump swells in her throat ; Valerie clasps the trembling hand . When she can speak again , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're going to make me cry . I 'm so sorry to burden you with my problems . Maybe I should n't talk about ? " " No ! " The sound is like a slap , harsh and startling . Reflexively Valerie withdraws her hand . Antonia continues . " That would be awful for both of us . When you went off with that man the second time , I was sure you were so angry with me you 'd never come back . It was such a relief when you called . If you keep things from me , I 'll know something is wrong , and I 'd only be able to guess the worst . I 'd hear it in your voice , in the way you walk across a room . No , Valerie , that would be cruel , do n't you see ? " Oh yes , she understands too well the subtle torture of living with  | someone who mutters answers to even the simplest questions and shuffles from room to room and pushes food around his plate , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be reading . Johnny was a master of body language , and she struggled to translate for years , at first trying to guess and finally asking what was wrong and always getting the same response . Nothing . Nothing . And the rest of it , the **36;0;TOOLONG , that reverberates in that one word . She does n't intend to do that to Antonia , who has been so good to her . " I 'm sorry for snapping at you . There is something I want you to know : Johnny 's coming with me to a DASH meeting . Kevin Murchison says if Johnny and I present ourselves as a couple who believe that God has sent us to help children , we 'll be okay . " There 's only one problem . If the anonymous caller is from DASH , I ca n't give them your telephone number . How could Valerie Vincent , Joanna 's mother , have the same number as some sweet , inquiring schoolteacher from Montana ? They 'd know right away , do n't you see ? So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask Nadia and Carl if I can give DASH their number . It will mean changing the message on their machine , at least for a while , but I ca n't think of any other way to keep DASH from getting suspicious . " Antonia shrugs . " They 're out taking care of some errands for me right now . I have no objection , as long as they do n't mind . I expect they 'll be back in a couple of hours . " " Then that 's the last little piece . Johnny and I have some details to go over , but I really believe we 'll be ready . I 've been thinking a lot about how we have to act at that meeting . " " Fervent . " That 's all she says , but it 's a sign that Antonia has accepted the inevitable . " Yes , I suppose that 's what we have to convey . That we 're pious people who ? " " Not pious . You do n't want to set up a holiness competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but fervent and willing to suspend your own judgment in deference to the will of the group . " She 's nodding , as though she 's turned the words over in her mind and found them sound . Antonia is in her element , giving advice about propriety . " Miguel knew so many different people from his business  | dealings , and I met a lot of them during the few years we had together . You 'd be surprised how many people need clearly defined rules and identifiable enemies . That way , if they fail at something , they can find fault outside themselves . I know how those people think . You must be well-mannered and narrow-minded . " Antonia has neatly labeled the ideas she and Johnny discussed ; remembering her words will make the act easier to pull off . " Low key , I think . I do n't want to say more than I have to because that would appear rude , and besides , I do n't want to make a mistake and give myself away . " " Good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not ladylike to hurry . Be calm and deliberate . You remember Mrs. Dillon , the woman in the blue bedroom in East Hampton ? Think about her , become her , and you 'll be halfway there . " Antonia is enjoying the game . Mrs. Dillon . The woman who shrank as though she 'd been physically assaulted when Antonia told the story of Miguel Carrera standing up at a black-tie banquet to announce that he had n't yet been served his main course when everyone else was already up to dessert . " Oh , Lord , if I have to become Mrs. Dillon , I hope it 's a very short meeting . " Valerie laughs , and the last frozen layer of tension between them melts away . " I 'm sure you 've already thought about your appearance . You must wear simple lines and unobtrusive colors . " Her cheeks glow and her words tumble out as her excitement mounts . This is Antonia 's forgiveness , and it 's welcome . " Good fabric , simple styles , no display of skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath , I think . Shoes with heels no higher than an inch . No colored hose . And very little makeup , although you must wear lip-stick . " Despite herself , Valerie ca n't help laughing again . " And how shall I wear my hair ? " " Tied back . " Antonia 's head is cocked , as though she 's selecting from a lineup of hairstyles . " Low on your neck , with one of those dreadful fabric-covered elastics everyone 's wearing these days . Is n't that what you told me last week ? That everyone on the afternoon dramas had the same hairstyle ? Well , that 's how you should look . That 's what they 'll expect . "  | " You 're wonderful . " She leans down and hugs Antonia gently , gripping the thin shoulders beneath the satin bed jacket . " I 'm just trying to help . Now you go ahead . I 'll be all right here until Nadia comes back . Tell MaryBeth you 're looking for an ensemble that reeks of quiet elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should be ? " " Restrained . " Antonia smiles and nods . " Exactly . " Seventh Avenue is thick with young women pushing strollers . She wants to warn each of them to hold on tight to their babies . Instead , she averts her eyes to the shop windows and reads every sign and poster with meticulous attention until she spots the sign for MaryBeth 's across the street . The shop is in the middle of the block , its doorway flanked by pots of daffodils and hyacinths . She starts to cross , looks to her left to check for oncoming traffic . A blue Ford shoots the light , and Valerie does a double take . Is that Kristin Denby driving ? She 's only met her a few times  --  in the job interview , and her first week of work at Antonia 's  --  but something about the driver 's face makes her think of Kristin . Did n't Antonia say she was away on a vacation , some island , Hawaii , the Caribbean ? The car reminds her of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they drove to the Great Smoky Mountains on their honeymoon . She rushes across the street and heads for MaryBeth 's before the memories can slow her down . A bell jingles when she pushes the door open . The store is like a summer garden , scented with the lilies of the valley that brighten the counter . In the corner , a freshet of water flows over a carved , glinting stone into a catchpool . A perfectly coifed blonde in a flaxcolored sheath introduces herself as MaryBeth and asks if she needs help . The woman who answered the phone when she called about DASH had that kind of voice , a bit of cultivated country club hush in her responses . Yes , certainly , tomorrow night at six . On Albemarle Road . I look forward to meeting you and your husband . " I 'm just looking , thank you . " Valerie ca n't quite bring herself to say she wants something quietly restrained .  | " Here 's an outfit I love . " MaryBeth 's face is hidden for a moment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an oatmeal color , from the rack . Not exactly what your average Iowa mom would wear to a PTA meeting . She wanders along the racks of spring clothing , thinking about Joanna . Two and a half days and still no sign of the woman who walked down the subway stairs with Joanna in her arms . The earth has not simply swallowed them whole . They 're out there somewhere , somewhere , unless No . She wo n't succumb to her worst thoughts . MaryBeth is hovering ; Valerie ca n't stand being in this scented , expensive atmosphere much longer . In the end , she walks out with an A-line skirt and matching blazer , a pair of low-heeled pumps , and two blouses , one white , one to match the wheat-colored suit . Even on sale , they cost as much as she used to spend on food for three months . Laden with packages , Valerie Vincent walks briskly through the late morning crowd . She has to hurry so she can meet Johnny at one , to go over their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes . She ca n't stand here on this friendly , crowded street as though she were just a shopper like everyone else , a woman with her life intact .  | He had the order sheet right in his hand , but Lucas Starr was sure he 'd forgotten something . Tenpenny nails , caulking , ax handles . His regular customers finally understood that he was n't just after their money when he advised them to replace their ax handles every couple of years . Any fool could see that when an ax handle gets all banged up , it loosens so that splitting large pieces of wood becomes a dangerous proposition . Was it something Martha reminded him about ? Not this time . She had n't said more than four words to him since John and that woman left , as though he was too dumb to tell she was angry just from looking at the way her mouth pressed together . She 'd get over it . She knew what was important . You could n't go around letting people disrespect God , disrespect the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could live on this green earth and do right . Maybe she had to work up to the kind of firmness it took , a woman like Martha , always trying to make people feel good by giving them what they wanted instead of what they needed , what was good for their souls . That was part of the problem , he had to admit , with John . They 'd always been too easy on him , mostly because of Martha 's softness .  | Well , that was n't how it was going to work this time . Lucas turned the corner , passed the housewares  --  stupid that people expected a hardware store to carry kitchen doodads , not hardware at all but these plastic dish drains and little cutesy containers with flowers on them that cost $3.99 . Did n't have the sense to know that a plain old canning jar would do just fine . He looked at his order list again , wandered past the paint section , then headed down another aisle . That was it . Clothesline . Thick , strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was useful for . . . And the price was going up next month . Who ever heard of prices going down these days ? So he better order more than he really needed , take advantage of the low price while he could . Same principle applied to John , did n't it ? They had this one last chance with the boy , and Lucas Starr was n't about to let his wife talk him out of what he knew was right . Nodding agreement to his silent resolve , Lucas Starr headed for the cash register . John was just going to have to make some changes in his life . That was all there was to it . Another time , he 'd allow himself to get royally , luxuriously pissed . But he was n't going to let himself brood about his father and he was n't going to give him what he wanted just to make peace . Those days were over , and besides , he had other things to think about , other things to do . Like that DASH meeting Valerie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , and he 'd said yes . For Joanna . Johnny Starr took another bite of his salami and provolone sandwich and licked a spot of mustard from his thumb . The room looked good ; whoever was moving in here was getting his money 's worth . Or hers . Theirs , probably , in a three-bedroom apartment like this . One kid , two , maybe , each in one of the smaller bedrooms . Family . In his mind he placed furniture around the room . A queen-size bed with a headboard that had one of those built-in bookcases , light wood for the dressers , maybe a rocking chair in the corner . And in the other two bedrooms , bunk beds for the boy , shelves for display-  | ing model airplanes and Little League trophies , twin beds with ruffled skirts for the girl , dolls on the shelves instead of model planes . Or maybe she was still only a toddler . Maybe she 'd wake in the night in her new room and not know where she was , disoriented and tearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and sang her to sleep with a half-whispered lullaby . Brushed the hair away from her head . Tucked the covers around her little shoulders as her eyes drooped closed and made sure she had her teddy bear . A teddy bear like the one he 'd seen in that store window on Second Avenue , a smallish creature all golden tan , his amber eyes inquisitive , serious , as though he knew wonderful stories and was likely to share them with the little girl as soon as her father walked out of the room . Laughing to himself , Johnny Starr wrapped the half-eaten sandwich in the paper , tossed it in the bag , and patted his back pocket to make sure he had his wallet . That teddy bear could n't be so very expensive , but there had been only one left and he had to make sure he was the one to get it . It was perfect . The silk scarf was n't right , and she wanted to find something more suitable today . Antonia 's birthday had come and gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . She knew the scarf would n't do two weeks ago , when the salesgirl , snapping her gum noisily , had folded it into the box and done a surprisingly good job with the wrapping paper and bow . She 'd taken it anyway . It was always so hard to find exactly the right gift for Antonia , and this was a birthday she seemed to think was a particular milestone . Kristin glanced at the white plush slippers . Not fine enough , although Antonia would scorn a gift that was chosen just because it was expensive . She fingered the rich , blue piping on a satin robe ; Antonia never wore bathrobes , only bed jackets , always insisted they be white . Like her furniture . Like those - snow- topped mountains in Vermont . Like the carefully combed mane of Charles Babcock 's hair . Books on tape ? No , Antonia wanted the stories to be hers alone , created for no one else , shared only by the storyteller who crafted them . -  | As she passed the window , she stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a superb job with her hair ; Antonia was sure to approve , would say how pleased she was that Kristin had finally made the change she 'd been urging for so long . A new bowl , filled with gardenias  --  that might be exactly right . But it would have to be black , and the perfect black bowl might not be so easy to find , might take more time than she had . Resigned to the search , Kristin started for the door , turned where the glass counter opened onto a wide aisle . And there it stood , the perfect gift . The largest bottle of that bergamot-scented cologne Antonia adored . Since the company went out of business , the cologne had become a precious commodity in that house . Antonia would cry out in delight , thrilled that someone knew her so well and had been so thoughtful . Maybe , when she presented her special gift to Antonia Carrera , the woman would understand .  | " You were successful , yes ? " The question comes from the study , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no mood for chitchat about clothing . " I did find an outfit , " she says , at once relieved and disappointed that Antonia is n't announcing another phone call that 's come in her ab-sence . " Show me your treasures , will you ? " Antonia clicks off the televi-sion . One article at a time , Valerie pulls the garments from the bag and offers them to the scrutiny of Antonia 's fingers . As she handles each piece , Antonia keeps up a stream of questions , asking about how Valerie was treated by the shopkeeper , inquiring about the activities on Seventh Avenue , the volume of foot traffic , the presence of new stores or restaurants . Valerie responds automatically , embellishing on the mundane details of the shopping trip while she goes through a mental checklist of all the things she and Johnny have to talk about when he comes by . But something Antonia says about how hard it is to park near MaryBeth 's jogs a memory . " I thought I saw Kristin Denby today driving down Seventh Ave- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ? You said she was leaving for a short vacation in the Caribbean , right ? " " Oh , I think that 's not until next week . Actually , maybe you did see her . She stopped by while you were gone . To bring me a birthday present , of all things . " Antonia seems uncomfortable with the idea ; she points to a familiar gold box on the desk . " Can you believe it ? She gave me the same thing you did . " Except that the bottle in the gold box is three times the size of the one she bought . Tropical Nights Apres-Bain . As the weather gets warmer , Antonia splashes it on as though it 's a replacement for air conditioning . " Well , then , I applaud her good taste . " Antonia smiles weakly at the joke , then touches her forehead with the back of her hand . " I 've just taken some of my headache medicine . I 'll be all right in a little while . Will you spend some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more minutes , until the medicine starts to work ? " How can she refuse ? Antonia wants to be surrounded by words , to help her forget her headache . That 's not a lot to ask . " Of course , " she says , and she sits at the desk . What can she talk about that wo n't end up upsetting both of them ? " What 's it like near the park now ? Is anything happening out there ? " Even with a headache , Antonia has sensed her dilemma . From the bay window , the scene outside is singularly uninteresting . Or maybe she 's just too worn out to see the story potential . " There 's not much traffic . The sun is just turning the tops of the trees bright gold . " " Tell me about the people . Is anyone walking into the park ? " Uneasy , Valerie looks up the street , down the street , sees no one . There , on the corner -- -she 'll move the young couple closer to the park entrance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their foreheads touching and their hands on each other 's shoulders . " " Ah , good . Tell me more . " There 's not much to see , but she continues anyway . " From here , they appear to be no more than seventeen or eighteen . Something 's made them both sad . He 's got his hand under her chin ? " She watches as the two take off down the street , a vigorous , decisive energy propelling them forward .  | " ? and she 's turning her head away . She 's wearing a tan raincoat , comes down almost to her ankles , and she 's got a huge purse , maybe it 's a book bag , slung over her shoulder . " Specifics . Antonia always wants specifics , as vivid as she can make them . But the young couple is nearly a block away now , the details sketchy at best . Surely Antonia will know she 's making up a story and not really describing the scene outside . " And the boy , what 's he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , with epaulets and lots of zippers . He 's got the collar turned up and his hands are stuck into the pockets of his jeans . He 's wearing pointy-toed boots , too . Oh , and there , when he turns his head , I can see he 's got a small gold earring . " The street is deserted now , the couple long gone around the cor-ner . Valerie continues : " She 's started to walk away from him and he 's standing there , frozen . With his hands out , but she 's not there for him to touch . Now he 's going too , in the other direction , kind of shuffling along . He 's turning to look at her , but she 's still walking at a brisk pace , head up . " " It 's not an argument , am I right ? What do you suppose has come between them ? " Antonia 's hands grip the armrests of the chair ex-pectantly . She wants speculation , too . Not just description but reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " I 'd say she was breaking it off with him . They seem too young to be so serious , but she 's the one who 's having an easier time of it . But , honestly , neither of them seems to be very happy about parting . " But , honestly , it 's all a lie . " You were that age when you started college the first time , were n't you ? " Antonia might need the distraction , but she just ca n't do it , ca n't give away another piece of herself right now . " I do n't want to talk about myself , Antonia . I 'm sorry . " Not really sorry , but she has to say it . Maybe she could have avoided all this by feigning her own headache . She could have escaped to her room as soon as she came in , a perfectly reasonable reaction to everything that 's been happening .  | " Nonsense . Again , I 'm the one who should apologize . Of course you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for that when things are resolved . When you and Joanna are all settled in here , and life is calmer . " Quietly , through clenched teeth , Valerie says , " Please , try to understand , Antonia . When Joanna and I are all settled , it 's going to be in Taconic Hills . Maybe I should find somewhere else to stay for ? " " I wo n't hear of it , Valerie . I did n't mean to upset you . Now , you must be exhausted . Why do n't you go upstairs and lie down , my dear ? I do feel much better . " Reprieved . All she wants is a door closed behind her and a quiet space . " I 'll be down in a while . " Her face still wreathed in light as the sun strikes the window , Antonia waves , and Valerie escapes up the stairs . She tosses the new clothes on a chair , pushes aside the canopy curtains , and lies down on top of the green quilt . She stares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a girl in a yellow dress walking on a leaf-shaded path in a country estate . No wonder Kristin chose that painting  --  she must have wanted to look at something that reminded her of solitude and languor , after a day of filling Antonia with stories . In truth , the account of the two young people in the park really did distract her for a time , took her mind away from Joanna for a few seconds , the way the stories she told herself as a child kept her from disappearing . Not really disappearing . But somehow those tales assured her that the world made emotional sense . Whenever she walked into a new school , it was the free times she dreaded . Recess , gym class , the lunch periods when she 'd sit at a table with a crowd of kids who had known each other all their lives . Sometimes she even wondered if she was really there . In her longago stories , no one looked through her as though she did n't exist . People were generous , fascinating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict and full of adventure . In the stories of her childhood , everyone lived in a universe defined by compassion and shared laughter .  | So different from the stories Antonia demands , with their intrigue and their intensity . She 's gotten better at creating those dramas , and it 's a good thing , too . The story she and Johnny will tell tomorrow night to a group of strangers will have to be the best one yet .  | Oh , Lord , it 's going to be a long day . Somehow , the time will pass . She 'll take a walk , find out if Antonia has any errands to keep her occupied until afternoon . She really should try to write at least a page for Kevin Murchison , a paragraph , even , but she wo n't , she knows , because sitting still will be impossible . Valerie Vincent tucks the blanket under the corner of the mattress , stands back , pulls it out , and starts again . By the time she 's satisfied with the results , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven . Ten hours to go before she can start to get dressed for the DASH meeting . Ten hours of trying to squash every horrible image that comes up when she thinks too long about what 's happening to Joanna . Ten to eight : Russo 's not in his office yet , but the newsstand on Seventh Avenue is open . She slips on her shoes , looks in the minor above the curved dresser , stops to shove her hair behind her ears . Alice Monroe would never go out without lipstick and with her hair springing out in five directions . But she 's not Alice yet ; it 's Valerie Vincent who needs to p 147 know whether anything 's appeared in the papers about Baby Jane Doe , and right now Valerie does n't care what people think when they pass her on the street . The carton from Bloomingdale 's is still on the table in the entryway when she returns , three newspapers tucked under her arm . Another chore to help pass the time : she 'll call and tell Kristin about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did n't Antonia say Kris-tin 's apartment was in the neighborhood ? That ought to be good for at least forty minutes . Twenty minutes to nine . Not too early to ask Antonia for Kris-tin 's phone number ; she 's already burrowed in her little nest in the study with the television for early morning company . But when she steps into the room , carton in hand , the television screen is dark . A man with tortoiseshell glasses stands beside the desk , tugging at the cuff of his tan and brown plaid shirt , smoothing the knife crease of his immaculate khakis . What she thought was an early morning talk show was only early morning talk . " Oh , I 'm sorry . I did n't realize you had a guest . " She backs away . She 's seen him before , she 's certain . He 's been here recently , one of Antonia 's East Hampton friends , perhaps . " Valerie , there you are . I was just saying good-bye to Mr. Mattucci . You remember Ernest Mattucci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come by several times since she started working for Antonia , but he 's out of uniform this morning . Without his usual three-piece suit and starched shirt she has n't recognized him . She forces a smile . " Good morning , Mr. Mattucci . " " Ms. Vincent . " He nods , gathers up the envelopes from the desk , then fastens the clasp on a leather attache case , his movements economical and impersonal . He usually comes closer to the end of the month , midmorning , nearer to noon than to nine , unless her mind is playing tricks . No , that is right . He always begs off Antonia 's invitation to stay for lunch . " I 'll talk to you in two weeks , then , Ernest . You 'll take care of those arrangements ? " " This morning . " He clasps Antonia 's hand ; a gold ring with the  | letters EM carved into the band glint in the morning light . " I 'd better be going . " His voice is deep , but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing her composure . She has to get hold of herself . If she does n't , she 'll blow the DASH meeting , and she ca n't afford that . " Good-bye , Antonia . Ms. Vincent . " And then he 's gone , his footsteps crisp against the wood floor . " Did you want something , my dear ? " Antonia 's cheeks glow with color , her flawless skin a study in contrasts , all cream and berries this morning . " I forgot about this package , the one that came the other day . " " Package ? " Evidently Antonia has forgotten too . " It 's for Kristin , from Bloomingdale 's . I think I 'll call her and ask if she wants me to bring it by . Do you have her phone number ? " Antonia tilts her head in thought . " It 's 555-0976 . I do n't know if you 'll find her home , though . She has so much to do ; what with wedding plans and fittings for her dress and appointments with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks . I 'll try anyway . Just for something to do . " Valerie reaches for the phone on the desk , dials the number she 's written on the small pad . It rings only once , and then a voice announces , " You 've reached the Denby residence . Please leave a mes-sage . " For days , it seems , she 's been talking to machines . " This is Valerie Vincent . I just wanted to let you know there 's a package here for you from Bloomingdale 's . If you 're going to be around this morning or early afternoon , I 'd be happy to bring it over . Just give me a call at Antonia 's when you get a chance . " " A machine ? You see ? Perhaps she is on that trip . Would you like breakfast , my dear ? Today may be moving too slowly for you , but you ca n't let yourself get lightheaded . Your blood sugar will drop if you do n't eat . Low blood sugar can be a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miguel would eat a pint of ice cream and drink three cups of sweet coffee , and then two hours later , when the first rush was over , he 'd sink into this terrible stupor . " Antonia smiles . " I do n't mean you 've been drinking , but you should eat something so your mind is clear . "  | The thought of food makes her feel ill ; even coffee would be too much right now . Valerie shifts the newspapers and edges toward the doorway . " Maybe later , Antonia . You go ahead without me . I 'll be all right . " " I know you will , Valerie . " She reaches out her hand . " I understand . You 're nervous and excited . You go ahead and read those newspapers . I 'll be here if you want company . " Valerie squeezes the outstretched hand and rushes upstairs . By eleven o'clock she 's gone through the newspapers , heard Detective Russo 's obvious discomfort when he told her they 'd put six more detectives on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her little bathroom could use a thorough scrubbing . She 's rummaging in the utility closet for a fresh sponge when the phone rings . Before she can stand , she hears Nadia 's voice calling to her from down the hall . " Miss Valerie , it 's for you . Miss Kristin . " Her heart stops racing , and she steps into the bedroom and picks up the phone . " Hi , Kristin . Thanks for returning my call . " " Hello , Valerie . I was out shopping . I 've been so busy lately , I practically have to make a list to remember to brush my teeth . And then , when the day 's over , I do n't even know what I 've accom-plished . " Kristin chuckles softly . Valerie smiles to herself , recognizing all those feelings , wondering when she 'll have the luxury of forgetting about time again . " I 'm sorry I missed you when you stopped by yesterday , " she says shyly . " Oh , I was only there for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appointment . Seventh Avenue is becoming a madhouse . Park Slope is getting almost as crowded as SoHo . At least there 's less attitude here . " If she were n't going back to Taconic Hills with Joanna when this is all over , she might even enjoy getting to know Kristin better . " And more reasonable prices . Listen , about that package . It came the other day . If you like , I 'll walk by with it . " " Thanks . That 's nice of you , but it 's only a sweater I ordered a month ago . I ca n't imagine why they sent it there . " " I do n't mind , really . "  | " Do n't bother . I 'll pick it up when I can . By the way , how 's Antonia today ? She had one of her headaches yesterday . I 'm sure she 's allergic to spring grasses or maybe the cherry blossoms . Every year it 's the same thing , those headaches start right in the middle of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specialist for six years . But you know how stubborn she can be . And how right she usually is . " Antonia 's not right about the DASH meeting . Not right about the risks being too great . Suddenly impatient , Valerie wants to end the conversation . " Well , as long as you do n't need that package , I guess I 'll ? " " Have you had any news ? About your daughter , I mean ? " How does Kristin know about Joanna ? Maybe there 's been an article in one of the newspapers or something on the television news , the radio . And then she remembers : Antonia called Kristin that first night , to bring groceries into the house . " No , nothing yet . Thanks for asking . " " Well , I hope things work out . Tell Antonia I sent my regards , would you ? " Without waiting for an answer , Kristin hangs up . Only six more hours to go . Fervent and deferential . The buttons of the silk shirt lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee , the leather belt from Kristin 's closet matches her shoes . The very picture of restraint . " Valerie , please come into my sitting room when you 're dressed . " All vigorous authority , that voice from the other end of the hall . No indication that Antonia Carrera has ever in her fifty-five years experienced even a speck of self-doubt . Valerie gathers her jacket and her purse , flips off the light , and follows the scent of Antonia 's floating gardenias down the hall to the alcove beyond the high , curved archway at the far end of the bedroom . " There you are , my dear . Come here and tell me about the light before you leave . " The scene on the other side of the curtain is so familiar she hardly needs to look to describe it . But Antonia will be listening for p 151 the whisper of fabric being moved aside , will wait to feel the sun or its absence on her skin . " It 's one of those wonderful , metallic afternoons . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds the air is golden . The shadows of the trees in the park are longer today . They 're reaching like tentacles across ? " " Now tell me about the people . Is the young woman and her friend with the leather jacket there ? " She can do this , but only for a few minutes . The clock on the bedside table ticks off the seconds  --  what has Joanna been doing in the time since she walked to the window ? ? as she scours the street for something to present to Antonia . " No , I do n't see them . But a florist 's delivery van is parked at the curb and a man in coveralls ? they 're faded but you can tell they were blue  --  is leaning against the back of a bench . He 's the only one on the street right now . " " That 's fine , dear . You sounded so tense before , I thought a little conversation would help you relax . Now , you must n't appear too anxious and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt and linen skirt ? Good . You 'll be home when , my dear ? 1 ' 11 wait up . " Wait to suck the juices out of her experiences . Later tonight , Antonia will wheel herself into the living room , allow them each a single glass of brandy , and indulge herself in the only gift Valerie can offer , a neat little package containing details of the evening . Everything she 's seen along the way . The people , the decor of the house . Overheard conversations on the street , if necessary , something unexpected , certainly , all for Antonia 's amusement . " I expect I 'll be back by nine or ten , but it might be later . No need to wait up . If you 're asleep , I 'll see you in the morning . " " Remember  --  use their family names . Mr. Smith . Mrs. Jones . Do n't call them Tom or Mary , even if they call you Valerie . Good luck , my dear . Be careful . " Antonia tilts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and skims the parchment skin with her lips , startled by the touch of Antonia 's hand reaching for her throat . The elegant fingers run along the collar of the silk shirt , then float back to her lap . " Very good . You must keep that top button closed . Class , my dear . It shows in the little things . Now go on . " Valerie tucks her purse under her arm . Deliberately . Without haste . It 's not ladylike to hurry .  | " I told you , " Johnny says as they wait for the light to change , " the subway was stuck for almost half an hour on the Manhattan Bridge . I even left myself an extra ten minutes but there was nothing I could do about it . " A trio of women in saris threaded with gold , their dark eyes crinkled with some private amusement , are waiting on the corner for the light to change . A gangly black man in oversized pants stands beside them , shoulders rolling in time to music only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's sure of that , and on the busy street she stops , closes her eyes , and sends her fears sailing off into the clouds . Blaming Johnny for breakdowns in the city 's infrastructure is n't going to make it any earlier . And walking into a convocation of judges twitching with annoyance at their tardiness is n't going to help gain their trust . As they scramble across the wide street graced with gabled frame houses and venerable trees in full leaf , she slips her hand in his . It 's just a role ; she 's only staying in character . " Try to calm down and I will too . I 'll tell them something , I do n't know . . . a sick aunt . Kevin Murchison says they 're big fans of  | traditional families , so maybe they 'll forgive us for being late . And you remember  --  we 're Mr. and Mrs. Monroe . Martin and Alice . " Martin and Alice Monroe are going to find Joanna . Unless the members of DASH have been warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are donning somber robes and fortifying themselves with Scripture readings before they accuse her of making a pact with the devil and flying through the air to attend a Black Mass . The house looks much like its . neighbors , broad porch wrapped around two sides , hydrangeas blooming in a neat border along the walk that leads to the front steps . " You okay ? " Johnny nods but he seems coiled inside himself , his hand locked tight around hers . She presses the buzzer beside the carved oak door , steps back , as she 's been instructed in the phone call , and waits . Her calm astonishes her . Curtains are lifted aside , but she continues to examine the brass doorknob , the gleaming knocker in the shape of a lion 's head , the dry , crinkled leaf beside the welcome mat . The door is pulled open by a woman about her age , surely under thirty , dressed in a slim blue skirt , matching jacket , and white blouse , the uniform of a mid-level paper-pusher . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Can I help you ? " she asks . " I called the other day . My name is " ? not Valerie , not Vincent or Starr ? " Alice Monroe . This is my husband Martin . " The prim woman peers behind Valerie , as though she suspects someone else might be lurking in the bushes . " We thought you were coming at six . It 's almost half past . " " I 'm so sorry . We tried to call and we got a busy signal . My husband 's aunt , the one we 're living with until our apartment is ready , she 's blind and in a wheelchair , and her usual attendant called in sick . Martin and I had to wait for the agency to send someone else . It seemed better for us to come late rather than miss the meeting altogether . " The scowl widens into a smile . " Come in , Alice . I 'm Pamela Cleary . We 're just about to begin . " The house smells of cinnamon and coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oven by a round-cheeked kf  | grandma in an apron . A grandma like Martha perhaps , the very picture of a matriarch whose sole pleasure is serving her family . Even with the lamps turned on , the living room is deep in shadow ; from the doorway , she memorizes faces she can barely see . Pamela Cleary bends over a man in a business suit , whispering her report about Martin Monroe and his old auntie , probably . Two other couples , older by at least a decade , sit on the twin upholstered sofas . They look like large bookends dressed in bland expressions and sensible shoes . The young woman makes introductions , each person rising in turn to shake Valerie 's hand , each hand a new test . She wo n't pull away , even though she recoils inside . She smiles and repeats their names to fix them in her mind : Jack Cleary , Colleen and Patrick Barnes , Helen and Arnold Lewiston . Such good , solid , Anglo-Irish names . Fine , upstanding citizens . Murmurs of welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cane-seated chairs near a brick fireplace . Too far from the door , she thinks , smoothing her skirt over her knees and glancing at Johnny . No way out except past the troops . Valerie swallows hard and folds her hands on her lap . Jack Cleary rises and straightens his tie , and suddenly she remembers where she 's heard his name . In one of the articles Murchison gave her . " Would you mind telling us what you told my wife on the phone , Mrs. Monroe ? I want everyone to hear it in your own words . " He brushes at his already perfect hair , a strange , horizontal smile on his face . The same smile he wore when he wrote letters to the editor of the Des Moines paper to denounce his brother ? She has to push that image out of her mind or she wo n't be able to do this . " Four years ago , I guess it was , we were traveling through the Northwest on vacation and we met the Stevens family . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't poised on the brink of their seats ready to pounce on her . " Kitty Stevens told us that her friends the Murphys joined a group that does a lot of good things on behalf of children . We care very much about children , my husband and I , and so naturally we were interested in the work DASH does . "  | Stares and silence . What do you know about my baby ? Valerie banishes the question ; she 'll get all tangled up if she lets her mind wander . " I mean , I do n't really know all that much about your activities , except that , when Mrs. Stevens talked about it , it sounded like something Martin and I would find satisfying . " Helen Lewiston smiles . " And how is Freddy ? " Freddy ? The Murphy children  --  Murchison has told her about them . There is no Freddy . Smiling , she says , " You must mean Philip , their son . I never really knew the Murphys , except for what Kitty Stevens told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Helen Lewiston nods . " You 're right . Philip . That 's his name . I 'd forgotten . Now , you do understand about confidentiality . We do n't talk to outsiders about our work , only to people we 're sure share our values and our goals . It would be so easy for the public to misunderstand what we 're about , so we ask that you tell no one what happens at these meetings . That way , everyone is protected . " The way you protect the children ? Valerie nods , hears the rustle of Johnny 's movements , wills herself not to look at him . " Pamela told her all that when she phoned , Helen . " Jack Cleary stands with his back pressed to the fireplace mantel , hands clasped behind him as though he 's about to step onto a balcony and deliver a papal blessing . It 's his rhythm that makes this group move from one thing to the next , and he fixes a piercing gaze on Valerie . " And she told her about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everyone wriggles forward , empty vessels yearning to be filled . They 're inclined toward Jack Cleary as though he 's their direct link to salvation . What a waste . He could be using all that power to send them out into the world to solve the problems of homelessness or bigotry . . . but that would be a different world and she would n't be sitting here wondering where her daughter is , who is feeding her , washing her face , tying her shoelaces . " Please tell us why you want to join DASH . Why you want to work with us . Beyond the obvious , I mean , your personal reasons , if you have any . " Now they shift toward her like a flock of expectant pigeons . She 's  | done enough preparation to have a response , and enough worrying to wonder how they 'll react to the crumbs she 'll toss them . " I did n't tell your wife about this on the phone , Mr. Cleary , but I do have personal reasons for wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them how difficult it is to dredge up her painful past . " I 'm not a hundred percent certain about the details  --  I was only six years old and I still wake up with nightmares , so I 'm not sure what part of it is bad dreams and what part I really saw . But I know something happened . In my neighbor 's living room . I was sleeping over at a friend 's house . It 's funny , I do n't even remember her name anymore because we moved away a few months after this night . " All I know is there was a baby and lots of candles and people dressed in black robes . Everyone had these large medallions hanging from long chains around their necks , five-pointed stars in a circle . Gold , I think . " The narrative is beginning to flow , and she has her audience 's attention . Everyone 's gaze is riveted to her face , except for Jack Cleary , who stares at the chair beside her , at Johnny . " They kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must have been wine because the baby did n't make a sound the whole time , into the baby 's mouth , passing her from hand to hand . Funny , I 'm not even sure why I thought it was a girl . It just never occurred to me to think anything else . There I was , halfway down the stairs , unable to move . I 'd gotten up thirsty and could n't find a glass in the upstairs bathroom . Anyway , I could n't make out what they were saying , except I remember hearing a strange singsongy chant , kind of like a constant hum . And then one of them picked up something shiny , it gleamed in the candlelight the way my father 's fishing knife glittered in the sun . That 's when I got too scared to stay there . " I was terrified they 'd discover me so I crept back to the bedroom . After a while I heard cars driving away and then my friend 's parents came up the stairs and looked into her room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop thinking about that baby and those stars around their necks . And the knife . I lay on the bed until the sun came up . Then I tiptoed down the stairs and ran across the wet grass to my own house . I never told anyone except my husband . Not until tonight . I always had this feeling that maybe I 'd imagined it all and that people would laugh at me . " Stop . Murchison has warned about too much embellishment . This  | is the right place to sit silently , to watch for signs of how they 've taken the story . " Nobody here thinks it 's a joke , what you saw . " Jack Cleary is the first to speak . The others have n't even looked at him , but she knows they 'll take a stand only after Cleary 's given them their cue . " You poor thing , carrying such an awful memory around all these years . " Bright tears splash from Colleen Barnes 's eyes . " You 've come to the right place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends of ours have , or . . . " Her voice breaks . " Some of us have children who have been forced to take part in those disgusting rituals . We know how far these people can go , how much of a shield has been put up to keep the public in the dark about their activities . Teachers , judges , social workers , cops  --  all bought off in bargains , literally , with the devil . They cover up for each other and they just keep on doing these ? " The woman 's face crumples , not with a look of outrage , but with the sagging , fearful expression of someone who knows she 's about to be chastised . By Jack Cleary ? " Grandparents too , " Patrick Barnes adds into the silence . " And day care workers and priests . Can you imagine ? Priests . You ca n't believe how far , how deep their network goes . " Arnold Lewis-ton 's eyes bulge with excitement . " All right , everyone . I can see Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have an important piece of business before we go on to matters that we must discuss in private . " Valerie waits , not eagerly but with the acquiescence she knows he expects . Johnny is balanced on the edge of his chair , concentrating on Jack Cleary . " It has come to our attention that a child must be protected . " This is not a dream , not some high school drama production in which she has a bit part . This mild-looking man really is talking about protecting children . He 's referring to her daughter . He must be talking about Joanna . " We need to find a placement for the child . A safe haven . And we must do this within the next two weeks . She 's been removed from immediate danger , but we have indications that it wo n't be secure , this haven , not for much longer . I 'll open the discussion by asking for recommendations . " Valerie keeps her eyes on her folded hands , not daring to look at II  | any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's absorbed enough of that to know it is n't her turn to speak . She ca n't , anyway ; her throat is tight with fear and anger . " I assume you 're talking about something that requires local action . " This from Patrick Barnes , whose voice is thin , watery , not at all senatorial . His wife reaches for his hand , but Barnes pulls away . " We need to do it differently this time . Too many people know us . " That 's why it 's been so easy to gain access to this group . This whole show has been for her sake , hers and Johnny 's . If not exactly street theater , then a bit of living-room dramatics so she and Johnny will agree to be the front-line troops for DASH , its public face . They all watch Jack Cleary intently , except for an occasional glance tossed in her direction to see if she 's properly impressed , sufficiently motivated , can read between the lines . Colleen Barnes pats her husband gently on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Maybe , " Valerie says , having no trouble making her voice sound hesitant , " it 's a sign that my husband and I are here today . A sign that we should be involved in this mission . " The smiles are unanimous . " I do n't know if we can let you do that , Mrs. Monroe . " This from Jack Cleary , delivered with paternal solicitude . " If you do n't have personal experience working with a group like ours , you have no idea what you might be up against . Before we ask you to participate in one of our missions , we need to hear what your husband has to say . You do understand ? We must ensure that children remain within intact families . " Johnny is sitting beside her like an alabaster statue . Maybe it would have been better if she 'd found someone else , a cop with undercover experience or a friend from Taconic Hills . They 've gone over and over the story , until he swore he was ready , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Look , Mr. Cleary , " Johnny says firmly , " I can appreciate your concern for your group 's interests , but I want you to know that I 'm one hundred percent with my wife on this . She wakes up in the middle of the night with nightmares . 1 do n't want other kids to have  | to go through that . We are definitely in complete agreement about this . " No one moves until Jack Cleary rises and extends his hand . " Good , that 's very good . We 'll see how things work out . There 's another meeting you should both attend on Friday night . Someone will call you before then to tell you where to go . We 'll see you then , Mr. Monroe , Mrs. Monroe . God bless you for coming . "  | They should run for their lives . When she hears the click of the lock behind them , she wants to vault over the porch railing and fly down the street until she ca n't see the rambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she and Johnny slowly make their way down the steps to the street , hand in hand . A slab of pavement juts up in the middle of the street , a gnarled tree root forces its way through two spikes of a rusted fence , supermarket flyers litter the sidewalk . Funny ? did she see any of these things before ? On the corner , Johnny has an attack of the shakes . " You did fine , " Valerie assures him . " Thank God it did n't go on any longer . I do n't think either of us could have lasted another thirty minutes . " " I have to get out of here , Val . Will you be all . right if I leave you here and catch a subway home ? " His mouth twitches , and a tic she knows too well dances in the corner of his eye . Better alone than trying to control his anxiety too . " Go ahead . I need to walk off some of my own nerves anyway . I 'll talk to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or if you hear anything else , right ? You 'll phone me ? " Yet when Johnny Starr leaves her , she almost calls to him . She  | wants to ask if he feels deflated too , if some part of him expected to walk out of that house with Joanna chattering between them . Prospect Park lies just ahead , and she heads for one of the dark paths carved into the green , undulating meadows that resemble alfalfa fields after first haying . Taconic Hills  --  she belongs there , in her small , sunny house , writing about her poor , benighted Salem women , with Joanna sitting beside her , piling wooden blocks into a teetering mountain . And Esther should be puttering in her tidy kitchen , playing bridge on Thursday nights with her cronies . Was Lucas Starr right ? Has she lost two people she loves because she did n't do her job right ? The old boathouse , rising at the end of the path like a columned Greek temple , is the backdrop for a group of people who glide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , faces stem with concentration in the twilight . When she slows to watch them , the footsteps behind her slow too . She slips the strap of her purse across her chest , picks up her pace , but the footsteps keep a steady counterpoint to her quickening gait . She kneels , pretending to shake a pebble from her shoe . " Alice ? I did n't mean to frighten you . " Pamela Cleary looks down through dark lashes . Her smile is apologetic . " You seemed a little upset . I did n't want you to go off that way . Where 's your hus-band ? " Was she watching from down the street when Johnny escaped in the direction of the subway station ? Surely this young woman has n't followed her just to offer a few comforting words . She has to stay sharp so she can  --  no , she wo n't use that word . Protect herself . She has to watch her back , that 's all . " He , uh , he was concerned about his aunt so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while . " Pamela Cleary lays a hand on her arm . " Oh , of course . I 'm sorry . I 'll go back to the house . Unless you want to sit for a minute and talk . " That Tai Chi class  --  they 're practicing movements that turn their opponents ' attacks to their own advantage . Away from her overbearing husband and his sycophants , this woman might be led into a discussion of things she could n't talk about in the house on Albemarle Road . " That 's very kind . But just for a minute . If I 'm late , my husband  | will worry . Besides , I do n't want to take too much of your time . " They walk to a bench that offers a lovely view of a thick-trunked willow whose new leaves are already trailing like languid fingers in the lake . In the distance , a radio throbs . " You know , I 've always thought it 's a little unfair , the way new people get put on the spot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does n't mean it 's fair . You have to tell total strangers these terribly personal things about yourself and we tell you nothing except group business . " Like so many of the closed societies she 's read about  --  the Rosicrucians , medieval clerics , the underground railroad of the Civil War days , the Salem conspirators  --  the lines of communication in DASH are controlled by a strict set of rules . It 's good to be able to put it in this perspective . " I 'm sure there 's a reason . I expect that if you do accept me and my husband , we 'll hear more about all of you as time goes on . " " Oh , I 'm sure we will accept you , Alice . You 'll get a chance to help the children . " Pamela Cleary toys with the clasp of her handbag , and Valerie waits her out . " I did n't believe my husband at first , " she says finally , her face reddening . " I have to admit Jack 's stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up because I could n't conceive of people being that . . . I guess the only word is bestial . He told me about them but I still did n't understand . We were eighteen when we met , twenty-three when we got married . On our wedding night , when I saw the cigarette burns on his buttocks and his groin , I thought I 'd pass out . It was terrifying to think his own grandparents could do that to their own flesh and blood in their demented ceremonies . Can you imagine ? " " That 's awful . " She can not imagine . She wo n't let herself think that such awful things might be happening to Joanna . Will not lose her focus to consider that Jack Cleary may have been a victim of unspeakable horrors . " It 's hard to believe his parents did n't know what was going on . This little girl your husband was talking about , is it like that for her ? " " Little girl ? " Pamela 's frown deepens . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , he did , he had to , she has to dig back and find some reference to a little girl . " Did n't he say she 's got to be protected ? " p 163 " No , I 'm sure he did n't say that . He said the children . ' He always says that . We all do . " And then Valerie remembers : it was n't just because she was thinking about Joanna , she really was listening to him . " He did say she 's out of harm 's way , actually his words were , She 's been removed from immediate danger . ' I felt so hopeful when he said it , wishing I could help . " Pamela Cleary 's frown evaporates . " You 're right . You are . Usually he 's very careful about not revealing anything that would accidentally put a child in greater danger . I did n't catch his slip , but now that you say it , I remember . " " I 'm so relieved I finally told someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weight has been lifted . " Valerie must n't let herself dwell on the subject of the child , ca n't give this woman the chance to see into her secret heart , where she keeps Joanna hidden away . " Did all the others really have similar experiences ? " " A lot of us , " Pamela says , but she 's retreated inside herself again . The welcoming smile is gone and she wo n't make eye contact . " You know , there 's something I do n't think my husband told you . " This is the real reason she 's been followed . Whatever the Cleary woman has said until this moment , it 's been preparation for what 's coming next . Valerie 's heart bangs wildly against her ribs . " There 's this journalist  --  that 's what he calls himself  --  with some very twisted ideas about what we 're doing , a man named Murchi-son . Valerie does n't flinch . " He 's done some really awful things , bribing a postal worker to intercept our mail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . He 's tampered with people 's cars and left things in their mailboxes . He thinks someone connected to us is responsible for killing his sister so he 's doing whatever he can to stop us . " Murchison has n't said a word about any of this . " He sounds like a lunatic , " Valerie says finally . " He is , and he 's a dangerous one . He once even sent a spy , someone who came around to one of our meetings pretending to be interested in our organization . Luckily , my husband did a little checking around and found out before it was too late . " Such a gentle voice , such a simple statement . But it 's a warning ,  | and Valerie feels a chill . " This person , this spy , never had the chance to do any real harm to DASH ? " " Oh no . Jack made sure of that . " This is n't the time to find out what Jack Cleary did to Kevin Murchison 's spy . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I better get going . I 'm glad we had the chance to talk , Pamela . I do feel much better . " Pamela Cleary hugs her , breaks away as though she 's overcome by emotion , and starts down the path that will lead her across the park , back to that awful house . After only a few steps , however , she turns . " If this Murchison character should try to contact you , Alice , the best thing would be to get in touch with Jack . Jack will know what to do . "  | A bell is blaring . The room is dark , except for the illuminated numbers on the clock radio beside the bed . Ten twenty-eight . She must have fallen asleep after she gave Antonia a quick report on the DASH meeting , so tired by the time she got upstairs that she dropped onto the bed fully dressed . The bell sounds again  --  Nadia and Carl must be out , and Anto-nia 's room is dark and silent . She bounds down the stairs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . When she looks out through the etched glass , she finds herself staring at Mitch Russo . The lock seems to have a mind of its own , but finally she manages to open the door . " Detective Russo . " His expression , harsh and forbidding , terrifies her . His eyes narrow as he closes the door and steps past her . " You mind telling me why you and your ex-husband went to that meeting tonight ? What exactly did you think you were doing , Ms. Vincent ? You put yourself in danger and maybe even screw up our investigation and what do you have to show for it ? These people are deranged . I do n't want another death on my hands . "  | 166 marIlyn wallace Another death  --  surely he 's referring to Esther , not Joanna . He should n't have frightened her that way , and he certainly has no right to reprimand her like an angry parent . Detective Mitch Russo has made his fair share of mistakes , and one of them may have cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me ? " He scowls and runs a hand over his hair . " Damn right that 's one of the reasons I 'm here . Look , Murchison 's a good guy and all that , but maybe he 's got a real blind spot when it comes to DASH , you know what I mean ? They 're not like the PTA , you understand ? It 's too damn dangerous . " Antonia used nearly the same words , and they 're no less condescending coming from this harried man . " Did Mrs. Carrera tell you that I went out tonight ? Or was it Murchison ? Who 's keeping tabs on me for you ? " " I 'm just doing my job , " he says , turning away from her gaze and looking out the window , " or trying to , anyway . Only I feel like your little game is making it harder . " " Well , here 's how I feel , Detective Russo . My daughter has been missing for four days . You 're only looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who murdered Esther . Which means that I 'm going to keep putting one foot in front of the other until I find her , even if you happen to think I 'm walking into a minefield . " " Even if it means putting Joanna at risk ? And do n't tell me what my priorities are , okay ? " Russo glares at her . " Let me tell you something , lady . Right this minute , two New York City undercover cops are putting themselves on the line by infiltrating a DASH meeting . We are doing our job , the one we 're trained for , the one we have the resources for . Will you promise to stay away from DASH ? For your daughter 's sake and for the safety of my cops ? " Damn Russo and his tight-lipped silence and his undercover cops showing up at a DASH meeting . He never said a word . No news . Nothing to report . So she made sure Alice and Martin Monroe filled the gap . They 'd gotten so close so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were doing ? " " Tell you ? If we went around talking about everything we do , three quarters of our cases would be ruined . Tell you ? No , Ms. Vincent . I did say we were doing everything we could . " Russo 's face burns red . " Now , will you back off ? "  | She can try to convince him that the contact she and Johnny already made with those people in DASH is valuable . She can tell him whatever he wants to hear so he 'll stop this harangue . Or she can ignore him . " I do n't know , " she says firmly . " I have to think about it . " Again Russo runs his hand over the bristly hair on his crown . " Your choice , lady . Your daughter and your decision . Anyway , that 's only one of the things I need to talk to you about . You have n't gotten any ransom demands , have you ? " Joanna 's all right now but if you contact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't qualify . Nobody 's asked for anything . She ca n't chance it now , ca n't risk the caller ? whoever it may be  --  finding out she 's betrayed him . Joanna 's life could depend on it . " No . No ransom demands . " " You 'll tell us if you do , right ? You wo n't try to play that game alone ? " That would be foolish , he 's right about that . " I 'll tell you if I get any demands for ransom . Are we through here , Detective Russo ? " " Not quite . We had a call from a neighbor of Mrs. Klein 's . Brought up some interesting questions . This might take a while . You mind if we sit down ? " She ushers him into the living room , lowers herself to the sofa . Russo chooses the white leather armchair near the fireplace , his dark eyes flicking over the brass lamp , the glass coffee table , the marble mantel . Whatever he thinks about Antonia 's spare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't show on his face . " We get these people all the time who call with wacko theories . I mean , they sit around with nothing to do all day but mind other people 's business . But this guy , this Mr. Sadowski , does n't seem the type . He phoned the TV station that ran the story the night of Esther Klein 's murder and they sent him to us . Mr. Sadowski told Teresa he remembered seeing someone about two weeks ago in a store on Flatbush Avenue . This woman was wearing a pin like the one your daughter was playing with the night she was kidnapped . " " Pin ? " She runs through the news story in her mind . Joanna 's tears , the yellow dump truck  --  that 's all she remembers . " When we brought her in , she was holding onto this dump truck for dear life . Would n't let go of it , so we figured we 'd let her keep it . You know , this kid had been through so much and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play with the stuff in the truck . Two shells , the kind my kids made into ashtrays at summer camp . A thimble , with all these painted roses around the edge . " " That was Esther 's . I remember she was afraid Joanna would pick it up and put it in her mouth and swallow it . I told her not to worry , that she stopped doing that when she was eleven months old . " " And a pewter pin . You did n't see it that night ? On the news ? " " A brooch ? " Not hers . And unless she kept it hidden away , Esther did n't have anything like that , nothing pewter . The only jewelry Esther ever wore was a simple silver bracelet and the Star of David that hung around her neck on a gold chain . " We got a copy of the tape from the news producer so we could show it to Mr. Sadowski . Teresa and I watched it with him maybe fifteen times . I want you to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That would mean seeing Joanna , those tears , her quiet , blank stare again . And her hair , Lord , so many tangles in that baby hair ... " Of course . Come into the study . We can watch it there . " She 's out of her chair , crossing the hall , turning on lights , flipping on the television , pushing the power button on the VCR . When she holds out her hand for the tape , he slips it into the machine and steps away . Jagged lines dance across the screen . As soon as the announcer 's voice introduces the Brooklyn reporter , she feels the damp sea air and smells the spilled gin again , as she did that night in East Hamp-ton . Then Joanna 's face fills the screen and everything else disappears . In the bright lights , her hair shimmers , fine and glinted with sparks of auburn , not as snarled as she 's remembered . And the tears are n't nearly as copious , just a trickle that finally leaks down onto her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way she looks directly into the camera with those green eyes  --  Joanna . Perfectly Joanna . When the screen goes blank , Valerie says , " Wait . " But the moment is over , and Joanna has been stolen from her again . " Well ? That 's a pretty unique piece of jewelry . You recognize it from anywhere , Ms. Vincent ? " Russo leans back against the desk , thick legs crossed at the ankles . A scrap of paper is stuck to the sole of one of his shoes .  | " I 'm sorry . I did n't even see it . I was looking at my daughter . " And feeling the fresh pain of loss , and a surge of anger at the woman who had stolen Joanna and at Russo , who had been her unwitting accomplice . " I 'll rewind it and run it again . I 'm going to freeze it on the truck . It 's not a real good shot but we 're having one of our techs making a still of it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only look at the bright yellow toy , at the thimble and the shells . And at the pin . " There . " Russo presses the pause button . She steps right up to the screen , but she 's wavering , her eyes drifting back to her daughter 's face . The pin is lovely . " I do n't recognize it . I 'd remember it . It 's definitely not the kind of thing Esther would own or wear . " She 's never seen it before , this faceless crescent , its curve a swing for a creature who appears to be a dragonfly-woman with delicate wings , her long dress flowing behind her as she rides the moon . Where did it come from ? " You did n't keep it ? " Of course he does n't have it . If it 's been stored in an evidence room somewhere , she 'd be examining the real thing . Russo shakes his head . As the tape rewinds again , he says , " Joanna was still holding it when they left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby up , truck and all , and started crying and kissing her face and talking to her in this teary , husky whisper . Damn good actress , if you ask me . " Damn uncritical audience , she wants to say , but does n't . " The other reason I 'm here is to tell you the medical examiner 's ready to release Mrs. Klein 's body . Have you made any arrangements yet ? " " I phoned . . . yesterday , I think it was . Parkview , on Coney Island Avenue . I 'm supposed to call them as soon as I hear from you . To tell them where they should go to pick up the body . " Body . The word is awful . It 's not really Esther she 's talking about . What happens to people who die without relatives , with no one around who can afford to bury them , or at least borrow the money from a kind employer ? Are they dumped in some deep hole in the ground or thrown on a mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries for them ?  | " Here 's the address . " He hands her a card . She slips it in her pocket , out of sight , but the talk of Esther has raised new questions . There 's the matter of rent on the apartment , the need to dispose of Esther 's belongings , to retrieve her own . Joanna 's toys , their clothes , the notes for her Salem paper .. . " Does this mean I can go back to her place and get my things ? " " Sure , we 've gone over everything and taken pictures and picked through the place . We 've found whatever we 're going to by now . But listen . . . you probably should get one of these services to come in and , well , scrub it out real good first . They know how to take care of these things . " Then there was that much blood , enough to make Mitch Russo think to tell her to get the apartment cleaned . Oh , God , Esther 's blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think someone was murdered , anyway , all clean and sanitary and confined in a small space , neatly , considerately , so that you could just roll up the mess in a paper towel and toss it in the trash ? All these days of focusing on Joanna , she has n't even allowed herself to think about how Esther died , could n't bear to imagine her enduring a long , painful death . Now it 's imperative to know every-thing . " Detective Russo , how was Esther murdered ? " His eyes narrow again and he looks away from her . " She was hit over the head with a cane . Hard enough to crack the cane . Cracked her skull when she fell . " Polished wood , a plain rubber tip  --  Esther kept the cane in the umbrella stand near the coat closet to remind herself to take her time on icy streets so she would n't slip again and twist her knee , as she had two years earlier . " So there must be fingerprints on the cane . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they match the prints of the woman who walked away with your daughter . Which means we still know zilch about who she is . The other set is Mrs. Klein 's . " He replaces the videotape in its cardboard sleeve . " She was one spunky lady . " " Spunky ? " How would he know ? " The M.E. found a clump of hair . Darker than yours . Twisted around Mrs. Klein 's fingers . "  | He does n't say the rest . That Esther fought to save Joanna . That she died in the struggle . " Listen , if you want , I can pick you up and take you to the funeral home tomorrow . Just leave a message at my office and I 'll - come by half an hour before . I should be there anyway . You never know with a murder who 's going to turn up to check out the body . I mean , here 's a perfect example . What if someone from DASH shows up and sees you there ? I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still wish you 'd stay away from DASH . " She 's not going to promise him anything , but she wo n't argue with the man , either . Esther 's bloodstained image keeps her silent . Russo stands in the doorway , the videotape stuck under his arm . " Just because you have n't answered me , Ms. Vincent , do n't think I 'm dropping this . I want you to tell me you wo n't go to any more of those meetings . " Maybe he 's right . Maybe she should leave it alone . The cops have been trained , have the support of backup waiting to break down the doors , pull guns if things go bad , the way all those television cops do . Television cops . . . On one of Antonia 's shows , they 'd reenacted an undercover operation in which a county road worker , an ordinary guy who 'd worked his way into a motorcycle gang , went to some meeting in the woods and helped the police find out who murdered his brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way ? " Look , I 've already been to one meeting . As far as I can tell , they bought my story and they trust me . And they told me about a child they 're getting ready to pass on to some new set of parents . To protect her from Satan , they told me . I want to go to the next meeting with Johnny , just like they said we should . And I want to wear a wire . " Said aloud , the words sound like a line from one of Antonia 's television dramas . " I 'm safe , you get information , and I get my daughter back . " Russo frowns . " No . I told you , it 's too dangerous and we 've already got our people working that angle . " " Then I 'll go without you . It 's not illegal , and I ca n't see how it would make it harder to find Joanna , just the opposite . " Mitch Russo looks as though he 's going to explode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck ; he holds his clenched fists tight against his sides . " You 're blackmailing me , right ? I 'm going back to my office now so I do n't say something I 'll regret . Sure , you 're not breaking any laws if you go to the meeting , but it 's not a real smart thing , you understand . Call me when you know about the funeral . Meanwhile , do n't mention this wire idea to anyone , not your ex-husband , not Mrs. Carrera , not even Kevin Murchison . " He 's going to go along with her plan . Maybe he wo n't let himself say yes right now , but he 's going to see the wisdom of using her as a way in to DASH . " Okay , I wo n't tell anyone . But I need to know in a day or two . " " You want to think about what would happen if one of them decides to show you a real welcome or something and they hug you and then start to wonder about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider that , Ms. Vincent . " " You 're right . I have to think about it so I 'll be prepared . But that 's why it 's better if we do this together . You let me know what you decide , Detective Russo . " He wheels around and stalks down the hall without saying anything . The door closes behind him , a polite click in the quiet night , and she pictures him walking along the park , shaking his head , and finally realizing she 's right .  | " I 'll come with you . " Antonia reaches across her dressing table and dips three fingers into the jar of face cream , then slathers it onto her face until she looks like an actor in a Japanese play . " I 'll have Carl bring the car around and we 'll go together . Funeral homes are difficult enough if you 're with someone , but they 're truly awful without company . You should n't be alone . " How many times has Antonia said that in the past week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chance to be quiet when she says good-bye to her friend . At least Russo wo n't follow her into the chapel and eavesdrop on her sorrow . " That 's kind of you , Antonia , but Detective Russo is coming by to pick me up . " Antonia 's concerned frown changes to a smile . " Of course , my dear . I only thought . . . Never mind . I 'm glad you 've got someone to drive you there . You ca n't get a cab anymore in Brooklyn and those car services , well , frankly , the vehicles smell of smoke and sweat and God knows ? " The telephone cuts off Antonia 's words . This has to be the phone call . About Joanna . Trembling , Valerie reaches for the receiver . " Yes , this is Valerie . " p 175 " This is Sally from Paragon Travel . Is there a Mrs. Carrera at this number ? " She ca n't catch her breath , can barely see through the haze of her frustration . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Antonia wipes the cream from her fingers , then smiles and holds out her hand for the phone . " Ah , Kristin 's honeymoon arrangements ? it will be my gift to the newlyweds . Here , take these tissues with you , Valerie . I expect you 'll need them . " " You mind the window open ? " Russo 's voice startles her . He 's hunched over the steering wheel , shoulders tensed and the back of his neck pleated against the collar of his shirt . " No , it feels good . I can smell flowers in the air , almost like springtime in Taconic Hills . " " You mean you do n't appreciate car exhaust and rotting garbage and that steam or whatever it is that comes out of those manhole covers ? " For the first time since Friday , Russo seems so uncomfortable that he 's actually chattering . " When I was a kid , my mother told me it was hell down there . I kept waiting to see a devil dressed in red pajamas like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires and poking people in the fanny with a pitchfork . " If only it was so easy to identify the true devils .. . " I 'm still not sure what makes that steam . I should find out , I guess . Someday . " All the things she planned to do someday . She ca n't start feeling sorry for herself now . " You gon na be okay for this ? I mean , you tell me what you want him to do and I 'll tell the funeral director . " The car rocks as they wait for the light to change , as though it 's straining to race away . Russo keeps his eyes on a sign across the intersection . " No . I 'm fine . I already explained everything to him last night on the phone . I 'll be fine . " The hush , the feeling that she left her real self behind and sent a shell that looks like her  --  she knows how it 's going to go , remembers from her mother 's funeral , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the ride along the road so glazed with ice the limousine crept for miles to the cemetery .  | And now , with Esther dead , there 's no one . The last person , except for Joanna , she thinks of as family , even though she shares none of Esther 's blood . She 's an orphan . She wonders about the word , what it will mean , until they 've parked in the lot behind the square gray building with the PARKVIEW sign in block letters above the door . Two men hover outside , yarmulkes fixed to the backs of their heads with bobby pins , the fringe of their talliths hanging below their belts like the tails of stray animals that have wandered under their shirts . The professional mourners . She shivers as she pushes past them through the heavy doors . The carpet is deep gray . A worn path leads to the chapel , but she turns in the other direction toward the door marked OFFICE and knocks twice . Russo follows her inside . How did gladiolas become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bland , disinterested face of a newscaster ; he beckons them to seats and offers stale crumbs of condolence . Then , as she knew he would , he gets right down to business . " With a body that 's been subjected to an autopsy , as I told you last night , Mrs. Vincent , we strongly urge a closed casket . You did say you elected cremation . Mrs. Klein was n't Orthodox ? " When she shakes her head , he goes on . " We can do it this afternoon and you can come back later , any time , really , to select an urn . " " I do want to be alone in the room with her for a few minutes . " If Esther had a daughter , if she were that daughter , she 'd be granted that much . The ruined body , organs removed and slits running the length of the abdomen , is no longer the woman she loved , but she still needs to tell her , whatever bit of Esther 's soul is within hearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is grateful for being loved . She has to do that . She follows the director out of the nondescript office through the waiting area empty of people , its chairs ready to receive mourners . He opens the chapel door and points to a closed casket lying atop a carpeted platform , then disappears as the door swings shut . The fine grain of the wood , polished to a sheen , is the same lovely , burnished golden oak as her hat forms . She 's letting her mind wander , not saying any of the things she 's planned . Perhaps Esther has some way of knowing . Maybe her spirit really can find its way into the deepest , most private places in her heart , to feel the love ,  | the grieving , the wish that Valerie could somehow turn back time to a week ago . What would you tell me if you could speak ? She 'll never know , not if she stands here for a year , but she 's not ready to go yet . This is the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as she was being murdered , did it to protect Joanna , and she paid with her life for the ferocity of her struggle . Esther fought back , the police said , and the fingerprints on the cane and the strands of hair tangled in her fingers will help them convict someone . But first the person has to be caught . Fingerprints , hair strands , pewter pins , what does any of it matter now ? Dear God , where is Joanna ? The chill air raises goose bumps on her arms and she shivers . Wear a wire  --  that was such a dramatic offer , but it will work . Before she and Johnny go back to the house on Albemarle Road on Friday she must convince Russo to let her go through with it . Both hands on the casket , the words she wants to say to her friend finally come . " I know you do n't believe in revenge , Esther , but I promise you , I 'm going to do everything in my power to make sure you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you . " Now she can go . Russo is waiting in the reception area in a chair near the door , his legs crossed and his jaw slack with inattention because there 's nothing to do , no one to watch . She had n't realized how exhausted he looks . When he sees her , he rises . " You okay ? " She nods , dry-eyed and composed , but she knows he 's not convinced . " I 've been better . Have you thought about it ? The wire , I mean . " " Sure . I 've thought about it . And the answer is still the same . " Bright daylight assaults her as he shoves the door open . All right , then , she 'll have to do it without him . " I want to walk back . It 's only about a mile . I 'll talk to you later . " If he 'd given her a different answer , she might have been able to sit beside him in his car and make small talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She heads off down the street toward the park , a green blur in the distance . Halfway down the block , a horn beeps . It 's Russo , motioning to  | the car . She scowls and shakes her head , and he pulls away behind a city bus spewing exhaust . The house feels almost like home , sun striking the uneven surfaces of the brownstone at an angle that makes it glitter with tiny lights . Not quite her home , but familiar . Except for the cottage she and Joanna shared until the Starrs invaded her life , she 's always lived in their homes , her mother 's , Johnny 's , Esther 's , and now Antonia 's , who has been so good to her through all this . It 's cool inside , and silent . Antonia must be napping ; just as well , since she has things to do . She takes her shoes off so Antonia wo n't be disturbed and then heads for the second floor . The risers are so solid that nothing creaks as she makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a voice calls to her from the bedroom at the end of the hall . " Valerie , I 'm so glad you 're home . Please come in here . " And she knows . These are the same words , and it 's with the same tremulous insistence that Antonia says them . Something is wrong . Antonia is propped against the pillows , the remote control in her hand ; a black and white Ginger Rogers twirls across the television screen to the strains of a gentle soft-shoe . " What happened , Antonia ? " The blind woman reaches out as though she 's searching for Vale-rie 's hand . " There 's been another phone call , Valerie . The same man , the same voice . Oh , my dear , I 'm so hopeful . "  | " He said it was very wise of you to take his advice about not contacting the police . And he said Joanna was doing fine . He made a point of that . I asked who he was , but he refused to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to you personally , and that he 'd call another time . " Valerie 's caught in a repeating loop of tape , reliving the hope and fear of that first phone call with each word Antonia says , mesmerized by the spinning in her own head . Her anonymous caller might be the person who will bring Joanna to the DASH meeting Friday night . Maybe he 's called just to let her know her daughter is unharmed , that she does n't have to worry about Joanna 's health and safety . But why would he do that ? " I think we both need coffee after all this , my dear . I 'll have Nadia bring some up . " Antonia reaches for the brass bell on the bedside table . Nadia appears , nods when Antonia tells her what she wants , and then goes off to fill the request . Antonia lies back against the pillows . She 's thrown aside the light afghan . The soft fabric of her trousers drapes against her withered legs , and she reaches down and pulls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | It takes a minute for Valerie to realize she 's talking about the trip to the funeral home . " About what I 'd expected . It 's almost a relief to be done with it . It feels a little like losing my mother all over again , in a funny way . " What made her say that ? She does n't want to unburden herself to Antonia . But now that she 's said it aloud , the hard shell of pain has a tiny chink , a promise that it may someday crack a little more . It 's true , she does know about the rest of this , how she 'll turn around expecting Esther to be there to hear her musings or to tell her about her day . " You must have been quite young when your mother died . You 're still young . I imagine you must have had a hard time of it . " Antonia 's head is canted toward her . With her finger she flicks off the remote , silencing the musical entertainment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . I used to think my mother was trying to torture me by moving around so much and she was sure I was trying to make her life miserable by acting out in every adolescent way I possibly could . I 'm glad we cleared things up before she died . " Her mother would have adored Joanna . It 's hard to think about that now without feeling a wrenching sense of loss . Nadia 's footsteps click along the wood floor . Coffee . . . Suddenly she knows she ca n't get through the rest of the day without a jolt of caffeine to keep her from sinking into the abyss of waiting . " Would you pour for me , please ? " Antonia holds her thumb and forefinger half an inch apart . " Just a bit of cream , please . Then , she never knew Joanna . That 's too bad . " What an eerie feeling , as though the woman has been listening in on her private thoughts . " She told me the day before she died that she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should remember all the things she 'd done wrong as a parent so I would n't make the same mistakes . I tried to make her laugh , told her I was insulted that she considered me a mistake . And then I said I planned to remember all the things she 'd done right , so I could pass them along to my daughter . Really , we were both apologizing for hurting each other . " " I can hardly believe you ever did anything to hurt her , not by design . You 're such a joy to me , I ca n't see you doing anything mali-cious. "  | In the shadowy room , Valerie understands she 's been invited to explain . " It was n't malice , but I can see now I was pushing her deliberately . I wanted her to either throw me out  --  which would prove that I was truly as bad as I was trying to be or put up with my antics until I wore myself out , ran out of ideas , and settled into adulthood . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? You reached some sort of understanding before either of those things could happen . " She can see her mother , arms folded , waiting in the doorway , and she shivers , remembering how close they came to going their separate ways that day . " I 'd been out with my friend Gene . Eugenia . Except she 'd never let anyone call her that , insisted we call her Gene even if she got teased about its being a man 's name . We were poking around the back roads , stopping every once in a while to pick berries or talk to one of the boys driving tractor in a field we 'd pass . We had a sixpack in the car and we decided to go sit with our feet in the stream out behind an old apple orchard where our friend Larry showed us morel mushrooms the month before . " We polished off the beer . It got cold , and I had to get back to study for my chemistry final . So Gene dropped me at home and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking like one of the original Furies . " She never got mad , you understand . It was always more like whenever I did anything wrong , she 'd get sad , kind of close herself up and give me one of these looks loaded with messages . About her disappointment . About my failure to help her get through her difficult life . " The coffee cup clinks against the saucer , and Antonia slides a finger along the inner rim until she 's found the right spot . " No wonder you felt you had to misbehave . It was the only way to break her out of that stupor . " Amazing how she seems to know certain things with such clarity . " That was what I was doing , only I did n't know it at the time . Anyway , I tried walking past her to go to my room , but she grabbed my arm . We may be poor , ' she said , but you do n't have to steal . ' I was indignant . I might have gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen a thing in my life . I had no idea what she was talking about , and I told her so .  | " She started screaming that I knew what she meant , that I 'd been breaking into people 's houses and taking their jewelry and silverware . She demanded to know where I kept all the loot , yelled that I was doing this to her just to make her life hell . I was really bewildered until she said something about Corrine , where did I meet this thief , she was going to call her parents and tell them to keep their daughter away from me . " Alarm and confusion make Antonia 's voice shrill . " You stole things from people ? Their jewelry ? With this Corrine person ? She was the instigator , I presume . " " Corrine Malfemme . Gene and I took forever to come up with the right name . My face turned a very bright shade of purple , I 'm sure . I told my mother she had no right to go into my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was seventeen and I was entitled to privacy and what was she doing snooping around reading things that did n't have anything to do with her . When I finished , she told me that I 'd left the notebook open on my dresser and she was putting my laundry away and saw it and could n't help reading it . " She did n't believe me at first so I told her again . What she thought was my diary was really just a story Gene and I were making up , an adventure we 'd started to write after the incident I told you about the other day , when we cooked breakfast at the reporter 's house on Copake Lake . " They 'd labored for hours , when they were supposed to be doing English homework and when they baby-sat for neighbors ' kids , adding a silver tea service here , a home alarm system there , trying to make the story sound as bad and real as they could . Antonia laughs , a staccato burst of sound that ends in a sigh of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misread you so completely . " " My mother said something just like that . We talked and talked about it , and finally she just got up and hugged me . That 's all , just a hug , but it was the first time she 'd done that in such a long time that I began to cry , and we just held on to each other until we started laughing . " " Surely incidents like that prepare you to be a better parent . You must have given a lot of thought to how you can keep the lines of communication open . With your daughter , I mean . So you do n't have to repeat the same difficulties with her as you did with your ? "  | From another room , a telephone sounds . It 's Nadia 's phone , the number Valerie gave to Jack Cleary . Before she 's halfway down the hall , the ringing stops . A loud , cheerful stream of Polish and Nadia 's husky laughter roll out into the hall from the bedroom she shares with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't an instruction from a honeyed voice telling her to be on a street corner to get her daughter . Is n't Russo or Gallagher , saying that Joanna is waiting for her at the precinct , that this time they 'll make sure the child is released only to her mother . Mommy . When she returns to the master bedroom , Antonia has finished her coffee . Valerie gathers the empty cups and loads them onto the tray . " I 'll just take these downstairs and put them in the dishwasher . Can I get you anything before I go ? " Antonia 's smile is touched with sadness . " No , I do n't need anything right now . You go ahead . We can talk about what you planned for your daughter another time . I know you 're restless . When you want some company , my dear , I 'll be here . You did n't really tell me very much about what it was like at the funeral home , either . Maybe later ... " And maybe not . Some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first good break they 'd had . Ramon Feliciano and his girlfriend had been seen on the street with a toddler . As soon as he heard the beat cop , what was his name , Sawyer , tell the story this morning , he 'd had a good feeling about it . Sawyer was bragging how he busted Feliciano two days ago for carrying a pebble of crack . Boasting about how he fought off an attack by Feli-ciano 's girlfriend , a hellcat of a woman with long dark hair who nearly scratched his face to ribbons while a kid in a stroller hollered like crazy . He 'd turned it over in his mind , talked it over with Gallagher , until it made some sense . Ramon Feliciano needed money to support his crack habit . His sheet was a long list of breaking and entering charges , ten years ' worth , plus the occasional late night flip of an old woman who should have known better than to be out on Fourth Avenue alone after dark . So maybe Esther Klein had been marked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed her home . Maybe the girlfriend noticed Valerie Vincent 's ID , thought the  | credit cards would be useful , only the Klein woman tried to chase them away , got noisy , which attracted the attention of the downstairs neighbor . Maybe she put up a struggle when they grabbed Vin-cent 's papers and one of them reached for the cane and smashed the old woman in the head again and again . Then , realizing what they 'd done , they 'd fled . Then they saw the kid and that piece of jewelry on the television news and really got scared because the pin was the girlfriend 's and could tie her to the murder . She came down to the station , claimed to be the kid 's mother , had all the papers , and off they went . It could have been like that . If they could find her , they 'd know . If she was the woman who came down to collect the kid , he 'd recognize her right away , he was sure of that . Mitch Russo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to see anything on the fifteenth pass that he might have missed the first fourteen times . " Okay , Mitch , let 's get this figured out . " Teresa Gallagher passed him a folded paper plate and some napkins . He peeled the plate back and pulled the sticky mozzarella back onto the slice of pizza . " You first , " he said , his stomach doing a somersault as he watched the oil gather into a pool on top of the thick cheese . " Where 's Feliciano and his girlfriend and the baby Sawyer saw with them ? They 're not home , they 're not at the garage where he hangs out , and nobody on the street 's saying a word . " Russo tossed the uneaten slice into a trash can , then wiped each finger carefully with a wad of napkins . " First thing comes to mind is they 're hiding . We have to put out the word we 're ready to cut him a deal on the crack bust if he comes up with the right information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge is in the mood . So maybe he 'll listen . " Gallagher shook her head . " Okay , macho man , who do we tell ? You have any good contacts in this neighborhood , or do we have to get someone who 's closer to the streets , Sawyer , maybe , to do our talking for us ? ' Cause I think my people are n't going to give Feliciano up if there 's a murder charge involved . And I want to have something to show for this time besides a case of heartburn and a 186 marIlyn wallace lost angel 187  | receipt for ten gallons of gas . " She bit into her pizza and chewed thoughtfully . Russo looked away . She was probably right ; it would n't be so easy to break community solidarity , if it meant turning in one of their own to a murder rap . " What about that guy at the bakery down near Atlantic Avenue ? You think he might get the word out to the neigh-borhood ? " Instead of answering his question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curb on the other side of the street . Two people in the front seat . A man and a woman ? Maybe two women , it was hard to tell from here . Might have been hard to tell even right up close , the way people all looked alike these days . A trickle of oil ran down Gallagher 's hand ; she blotted it with a napkin , crumpled the greasy paper plate , and stuffed the mess into the trash can . She lifted a pair of binoculars from the glove compartment of the car , sighted on the vehicle across the street . " Holy shit . That 's Feliciano . See that tattoo on the side of his neck ? The Chinese dragon ? It 's them . " He grabbed the binoculars and did a quick scan . A man with a scrawny ponytail and a woman with long dark curls . And a child on the woman 's lap . He could see part of the child 's arm , the top of a head , not enough to be sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the binoculars on the seat . " You stay on this side of the street and walk slow , like you 're out for a stroll , so you end up on the passenger side . I 'll cross over and come up behind the car and take the driver 's side . Let me get there first . " " Aw , gee , Mitch , you went first the last time . " But Gallagher was teasing , smiling at him , and they started walking at the same time . He stuck his hand in his pocket and curled his fingers around his revolver , the windbreaker suddenly too warm for the bright day . The couple in the Honda were arguing , shouting in Spanish . Feliciano 's hands smashed against the steering wheel . That little quarrel would keep Feliciano and his passenger occupied , would keep them from noticing two pedestrians closing in on their car . He was almost behind the car now ; his mouth was dry but he looked straight ahead . Not yet . Another couple of steps . A Boar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the driver glanced at the car . Russo wiped the sweat from his fore-  | head and approached the Honda . Gallagher was about fifteen paces behind , walking as though she were out for a Sunday stroll . Her hand , too , was stuck in the pocket of her blazer . Now . He leaned into the car . " Hey , can you tell me how to get to Prospect Park ? " Feliciano 's head whipped around , his eyes glittering with anger . " Get the fuck outta my face , man . Who are you ? Get outta here . " Feliciano turned his angry glare on Russo long enough to give him a good look . Gallagher came around from behind to the passenger side of the car and bent toward the car , her face not two feet from the child squirming on the startled woman 's lap . It was n't them . Was n't the woman who 'd come to the precinct . Was n't Joanna Vincent . " You have a hearing problem or what ? " Feliciano snarled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep walking , buster . " Buhstuh . Definitely a mean sonofabitch . But definitely not hooked up with the woman who carried Joanna Vincent out of the building Friday night . And certainly not sitting in this car with the child he was desperate to find . " Hey , man , take it easy . No problem . " Russo held his hands up and backed away , waited for Gallagher to come around beside him . They strode down the block in silence . " Shit , " he hissed when they turned the corner . " I was sure we were gon na wrap this whole package up , neat and easy . " " If you 're really bored we could bust them . " Gallagher grinned up at him . " Threatening an officer . Disorderly conduct . If we wait long enough , maybe we catch him being really abusive to her . Crime of the nineties , you know . Spousal abuse . " " I 'm not that bored . And do n't joke about that . You ever see what these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stopped walking , and stood , head bent , in the middle of the sidewalk . Her red hair blew across her face , and she reached up and brushed it away . " I was just blowing off , you know , so I do n't have to be thinking every ten seconds about where that baby might be . A little black humor . That 's what they call it , right ? "  | " No , they call it cynical bullshit . And it does n't sound so hot coming from you . " They had to stop this bickering . It was n't going to get them anywhere . But Gallagher 's face got all tight . " Because I 'm a woman ? Guys are the only ones with a license to be sarcastic ? You sound like my father . " If he were her father , he 'd be even sadder to see his daughter turning harder by the minute on this job . " I 'm sorry , okay ? We 're both disappointed . I 'm running out of ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her grit was a sign that the sniping was over . " I think we should talk to her . Valerie , I mean . Tell her what happened and find out if there 's anything she might have remembered about kids in the neighborhood bothering Esther Klein . Because even if it 's not Feliciano , the theory still makes sense . " " Sounds pointless to me . She already gave us everything she could think of . If she had any more ideas , she would have called me . " " Yes , I guess Valerie would n't keep something like that to herself . Funny how I think of her that way . Valerie . Does n't it seem like Valerie Vincent could be your sister or your neighbor or something ? " Or yourself . He could see how hard it was for Teresa Gallagher to keep her distance , but he understood . He 'd felt that way so many times through the years , especially when he first made detective . He nearly blew a case because he 'd felt sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by thieves . When he found out the guy was running an insurance scam , he vowed never to put himself in that position again . They were n't his friends , they were n't his cousins . They were perps or victims . But Valerie Vincent had definitely gotten to him . To both of them . " So , how would you tell your sister we came up empty again ? She 's gon na look at us with those eyes all full of disappointment , and finally she 'll let us know she expected nothing else from us anyway . " He was n't exactly thrilled at the prospect of going back there , but maybe Gallagher was right about asking one more time about Esther Klein and neighborhood kids . " Let 's get out of here . " They walked to the car , past the spot where the white Honda had been parked minutes before . When Gallagher clicked the seat belt in place , she said , " You know , I 've been thinking about her offer p 189 to go into DASH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer . She has to be , or she 'd have fallen apart by now . That scheme of hers actually might work . She 's already gotten pretty far with these nut cases . " " And you 'd want your sister to go in there with a wire ? Your civilian sister ? " He turned the key and the engine kicked over . " Maybe it 's worth a shot . I hate the idea , you know , but maybe .. . I do n't know . She 's smart , but she 's also too close to this case , too emotional , to be reliable . " " Too emotional ? Look at it this way , Mitch . She 's the most motivated person around . " Gallagher swigged from her diet cola and nodded . " And she 's already met those people . They told her to come back on Friday , right ? So that proves she knows how to handle her-self . " He felt his resistance sliding away in the face of Gallagher 's argument . They sure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media found out about Joanna 's disappearance , the NYPD was in for a shredding . How much worse could it get ? " I 'll drop you off , " he said as though the matter was settled , " and then go over there and talk to her . " He could n't do it . He kept seeing her face , those eyes , and he could n't bear knowing that , before he spoke to her about going in wired to the DASH meeting , he 'd have to tell Valerie Vincent he had n't found her daughter yet . At least it 's not worse news . He tried to take courage from that thought , but he drove right past the brownstone and kept going , all the way down Prospect Park West to the traffic circle at Fifteenth Street , hooking a right at the south border of the park and driving on until he realized what he was doing . The parking spot in front of the insurance office was empty , as though someone knew he was coming and had cleared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , but Cissie must have seen him pull up . She ran to him , her face white . " What happened ? Is it David ? It 's that motorcycle , is n't it ? Tell me , Mitch . "  | " No , babe , David 's all right . He 's twenty-one . You have to stop thinking about him like he 's still your little three-year-old . Nothing happened . I just needed to see you for a minute . " He 'd never done this before . And now he felt stupid , totally dumb to be standing on the street in the middle of the afternoon , in the middle of the messiest case of his life . Frightening Cissie like that . " I 'm sorry if I scared you , Ciss . I drove over here , I did n't even know why or where I was going . I just needed to see you . " The color was returning to her cheeks , and she stepped back and frowned at him . " It 's that missing baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ... It ca n't be . I told you this morning . I woke up with this feeling , it was so strong . Like God was telling me that little baby was going to be okay . I 'm never wrong when I get that feeling . You did n't ? " " No . That 's not it . Nothing like that . " He told her about the confrontation on the street , about his frustration and his anger and his embarrassment . Finally he understood why he 'd come to see Cissie before he spoke to Valerie Vincent . He could see it in his wife 's eyes , and he wanted to say it first . " I have to go talk to her about an idea that Teresa and I kicked around , but I needed to work this out before I saw her . It 's not about me feeling like a failure . It 's about a dead woman . And a missing kid and her mother . " Cissie wrapped her arms around him , and he buried his face in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother about your idea , " she said firmly . " And make sure you tell her about my feeling . You 're a good man , Mitch Russo . " Maybe he was , but he 'd rather be hearing someone tell him he was a good cop right now .  | Just as she steps out of the shower , the telephone rings . She ca n't tell which phone it is , Antonia 's or Nadia 's . DASH or her anonymous caller ? She 's dripping water all over the floor , ca n't stop to towel off . She wraps Kristin 's robe around her wet body and opens the door in time to hear Nadia say , " Yes , just a minute . I 'll have to get her . " DASH . " I 'll be right there , Nadia . " Her wet feet slap on the wood floor as she runs to the bedroom , pushing clumps of dripping hair out of her eyes . " Thanks . " Nadia hands her the phone and pads away down the hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , but she manages to get the single word out . " Is this Alice ? " A familiar voice . A woman , someone she 's talked to recently . Pamela Cleary . " Oh , hi , Pamela . Yes , this is Alice . " She 's not Valerie . Not Joanna 's mother . She 's a teacher . She 's Alice Monroe , and she wants to join DASH . " Now do n't be disappointed . We all know how much you and  | your husband want to help . Do n't take it personally . It 's not all decided yet , but I have to tell you the truth : we may use another family on this mission . Some members of the group believe it would n't be fair to ask you to do this so soon , not until you know a little more about what 's involved . You know what I 'm saying ? " What Pamela Cleary 's saying is they want to know more about her . And if what they find does n't meet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . She forces the panic from her voice . She must play the role  --  tell the story  --  of Alice Monroe . " That 's a shame . My husband and I went out and got a youth bed and some toys , new clothes , you know , little girl things . We thought you told us we 'd be able to help . Can I ask who it is , this other family ? " " I 'm sorry , I ca n't tell you that . " Pamela sounds truly regretful . " Please , do n't worry about it , Alice . You can still come to our regular meetings . Even if it does n't work out this time , there will be other opportunities . Jack says this is for the best . " Pamela 's heart is n't in it . She 's parroting his words , but the tone is all wrong , too apologetic , much too compassionate . " But the decision is still going to be made by Friday ? " " That 's my understanding . Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do know it 's going to be soon . We make plans and we wait to be told who , where , when . But not before tomorrow , I know that . " " Listen , Pamela , I 'd really like to talk to Jack . Can I stop by tonight , this afternoon , whenever it 's convenient ? " She 'll spin a tale for Jack Cleary to convince him that this child 's best chance for a positive , productive , yes , even pious future lies with Alice Monroe and her husband Martin . " Hold on a minute , all right ? " Pamela is going to plead her case . She 's taking a chance , pushing like this ; she 's not showing the proper respect for the authority of the group leader . She should have gone along with Jack Cleary 's plan , a good soldier . Oh , God , what 's she done ? They 're going to give Joanna away again to the wrong " Alice ? Jack says you and your husband should come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Can you be there at seven o'clock ? " It 's going to be all right . She can do this . " We 'll be there , " Valerie says , hoping that Pamela Cleary ca n't hear the note of triumph in her assurance . " Thanks . " She sets the phone back in the cradle and follows her damp footprints back to the small bedroom at the end of the hall . Every time she passes a window she pauses to look out . Traffic rolls by , people stroll or scurry along , and then disappear from the framed scene , and Valerie Vincent goes on with the business of waiting . This time , however , a dark car draws her attention . She watches with interest as it glides to the curb and parks near the fire hydrant two doors down . Detective Russo gets out and heads toward the brownstone . He turns left into the walk leading to the front door , and with each step he takes , she knows . The shoulders , the purposeful gait as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face all give it away and she knows . Joanna has been taken to a hospital so they can do tests to make sure she 's really as fine and healthy as she looks . Or they 're holding her at the police station , asking her questions , showing her pictures of suspects in Esther 's murder . Or Detective Gallagher is going to drive up in another car soon and Joanna will clamber out of the back seat and race to the steps . Unless Russo 's found her , and she 's not with him because he 's discovered something terrible , some unspeakable , unthinkable horror , and he She flies to the door . Russo 's standing with his hand on the buzzer , startled , mouth open . " I do n't have any news , Ms. Vincent . I 'm sorry , I really wish I had something to tell you , but I do n't . " He 's talking but she ca n't hear his words . She 's retreated again to the place inside herself where she goes to recover from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past few days , it does n't take very long for her to motion him inside . He heads for the study , and she follows behind .  | " If you do n't have any news he sits across from her . " I talked it over with Teresa  --  Detective Gallagher  --  and she convinced me we should let you do it . Go to that meeting on Friday with a mike and a recording device taped to you . I 'm not completely okay with the idea , you understand  --  we must be nuts to let an amateur take this on  --  but we 're going to do it . If you still think you can . " She could kiss him . She could lift his lumpy body from the chair and twirl him around the room in celebration . " Yes ! Of course I can do it . " " Look , besides the risk , there 's something else we did n't discuss . You got ta understand : going to that meeting  --  with or without a wire ? is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , maybe they 'll all just sit around and talk about the weather . You ca n't get yourself worked up thinking this is the end of it . " He can try to add his sober little note of warning , but Mitch Russo is n't going to steal this moment of victory from her . That meeting Friday night will be the key to finding Joanna . Better than that , she 's still holding out for the possibility that her daughter is going to be there , waiting to be taken to what they all think is a new home . Waiting to be folded into the loving arms of the woman who will feed her , bathe her , care for her with a mother 's love . " I have plenty of time to think about all the ways I might be disappointed later . Right now , I just want to be a little excited , okay ? " Russo shrugs , his face impassive . " Fine . Now listen . Detective Gallagher will come by on Friday afternoon and set you up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get used to how the wire works . We have to test the equipment and make sure the damn thing is n't going to jam up at the wrong second or something like that . " It wo n't jam . It ca n't happen like that . " Sure , good . I 'll be here . " " They called you , right ? " A pulse hammers inside her head . Russo could n't possibly know about the phone calls . Unless someone else told him . " Called me ? "  | " About the meeting Friday . You told me they were going to call you back to let you know where the meeting was . " She almost laughs with relief . " I spoke to Pamela Cleary about an hour ago . The Friday meeting is at the same place . We 're supposed to go talk to them tomorrow , too . A second interview . I think they just want to know a little more about us . And then we 're to come to the house again on Friday . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I can do both meetings with the tape and ? " " Let 's leave it the way we planned it , okay ? " Russo pushes himself out of the leather chair . " I 'd rather you did n't go to that meeting tomorrow at all , but if you do go , you go without the wire . We 'll do it on Friday . Meanwhile , I want you to think again about any neighborhood kids Mrs. Klein might have told you about . A delivery boy . Someone who followed her on the street , a kid who tried to snatch her purse , maybe . Like I said yesterday , we ca n't just give up on the other stuff . So you think about it . And call me later . " If she thinks about purse snatchers from now until Christmas , it wo n't help them find Esther 's killer . She knows that with a certainty she 's rarely felt since the moment in East Hampton when she saw Joanna 's wide eyes looking up at her from the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's probably a futile exercise , but I really will try to remember if I 've heard her say something about problems in the neighborhood . " Russo hesitates , then says , " My wife says we 're going to find her . Cissie always has these feelings  --  it 's kind of weird to be saying this ? but she made me promise to tell you . " " Thank her for me , would you ? " She closes the door quickly , so he wo n't see her tears and change his mind .  | The second one tasted even better than the first . Johnny wrapped his fingers around the handle of the squat , thick mug licked at the foam that lingered on his lips . Everyone was always trying to tell him what to do . Francine , Valerie , his boss , those peculiar , uptight people si around that house in Brooklyn , Martha and Lucas , especially Mt and Lucas , all his life , never trusting him to make the right chc Even when he was fifteen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they hovered and criticized and second-guessed never let him exercise his own judgment . Now Lucas was trying to force him into church and make over so that he wore their brand of propriety . Well , maybe that fine for him , a man living out of time , in a past that did n't exit most of the world anymore , but Johnny Starr was never again g to be held hostage to his parents ' demands . And ramrod Jack Cleary and his prissy little wife , jerking t around , trying to get them to see conspiracies everywhere . Si around in their gray suits and ties , with their wives in that Ste stupor , doing exactly what they were supposed to , all of them ried sick about Satanic cabals , so committed to sanitizing the w  | Kevin Murchison 's magazine articles were right on : those people did n't realize the filthy little corners of their own souls could use a good scrubbing . He lifted the glass to his lips , hesitated , then gulped down half the remaining beer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightheaded and a lot more powerful , but this was enough . Just this second one , he 'd finish it and stop . He could do this . Two beers , that 's all , and then he 'd walk away and feel better for it . He was the one deciding just how far to go . If he 'd learned nothing else in the year of counseling , it was that he was in control of his own behavior , not any of the people on that long list . And not the alcohol , that was for sure . Johnny Starr looked at his watch , glad for the twenty minutes before he had to leave to meet Valerie . He needed this time to get himself calm , to find that place where he could meet the person he 'd told them he was , God , what was the name ? He laughed . Anyway , if he could n't remember when he got there , they 'd only think it was his excitement and not that he 'd actually forgotten his own name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Alice . A my name is Alice and I come from Alabama . When she was a girl , did Valerie play that game ? Seemed like that 's all they did in second grade , those girls with their little pink balls on the blacktop of the school driveway as they waited for the bright yellow buses to carry them home . J my name is Joanna and I come from . . . where ? Where would she say ? Brooklyn , Taconic Hills , where ? " Get you another ? " The bartender offered her college-girl smile and nodded at his glass . " No , thanks . " He slid a ten across the damp surface and watched as she picked it up and set it beside the cash register while she counted out his change . He did n't want another one , did n't need it , was n't going to fall into those old patterns . Proof , was n't it , that he was stronger than any of them gave him credit for ? If nothing else , maybe Francine would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . She 'd been feeling so safe . Until that detective knocked on the door and forced Franny to hide in the bedroom and sent her running down the rickety , rusty steps of the fire escape . Maybe now she 'd finally see the wisdom of what he 'd been saying for months  --  if they got married she would n't have to  | worry about being shipped back , would be able to live like a normal person , without looking over her shoulder all the time . Just the two of them , making a life on their own terms . The two of them and Joanna . They 'd get Valerie to agree to a regular schedule of weekends , so that Joanna became a real part of their lives . The last of the beer cooled his throat as the half glassful slid down . Johnny Starr scooped up the change , slid a dollar bill to the edge of the bar , and looked at the door . Outside , the sun was so dazzling , people wore sunglasses to shield themselves from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to think , really think clearly without the distractions of all that brightness and noise . He was ready for whatever they planned to throw at him , prepared to convince those Clearys and their gang of four , the puppets , that he was Michael Monroe , husband of what 's her name , Alice , that 's it , and that they were fine , concerned citizens who wanted to help kids , that he was a good provider who believed that children needed to be shielded from the devil-worshiping idolaters , and that he polished his shoes and combed his hair and made his bed and cared about all those tiny details , that superficial minutiae they seemed to think mattered so damn much . What a bunch of lunatics . But that was n't his problem . And at least he 'd prove to Valerie that he was ready to be his daughter 's father . Going to these dumb meetings would accomplish that , if it did nothing else . When this was over , he 'd have plenty to do to settle into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting up the business , starting to paint again so that the images he 'd been wrestling with in his mind might finally come alive on canvas . Settling in for all the world to see with Francine and with Joanna . But first they had to get through the next couple of days . He was ready now . Johnny Starr grabbed a handful of mints , popped one into his mouth as he stepped out of the shadows . Five minutes left , just enough time to walk from the corner of Seventh Avenue and President Street to the Carrera house on Prospect Park West , where he was meeting Valerie . He made sure his shirt was tucked in all around as he headed down the street .  | Something 's going to go wrong . The persistent refrain is driving her mad . They may have a plan , but that does n't mean it 's going to work . The only thing she can do is stay alert and prepare thoroughly . First , the costume . A small-town teacher with her white blouse buttoned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-heeled , unscuffed shoes . She looks as though she could stand in front of thirty-five restless ten-year-olds for hours . The small gold hoops in her ears finish the picture . The image in the mirror is positively dripping with propriety . But it 's not only how she looks ; she has to play to her audience without hitting any false notes . So many ways she and Johnny can be unmasked . Too many possibilities for blowing the scene . He 'll be here in five minutes , an hour too early for the meeting on Albemarle Road , but he does n't know that , is n't aware of her little precaution to ensure that they 'll ring the bell precisely at seven . Even if they have to walk around the park until their feet ache , they will definitely be on time for this meeting . They 'll tell their story sincerely , emphatically , irresistibly , and she 'll have her daughter back . p 201 And then what 's to stop them from coming after her when she 's settled in yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joanna , grabbing her up off the street on her way home from school one day ? She 'll just have to find a way to keep them both safe , even if it means moving to another state and taking another name and never seeing the rolling hills of the Hudson Valley again . She tosses two twenties into the zipper section of her purse and lays the snapshot of Joanna in a dresser drawer , runs her finger along the curve of her daughter 's cheek before she slides the drawer shut . Soon , baby . Only a day . A breeze blows the curtains aside , and she reaches over to shut the window . Johnny Starr is across the street , leaning nonchalantly against a car as he looks up at her with a strange , sly smile lifting his mouth . His dark trousers and blazer look crisp , his white shirt dances with reflected light . He waves , then crosses the street , and Valerie Vincent runs down the stairs . How nice that one of them is relaxed and at ease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , and all 's right with the world . " Val , you look like the Saturday Evening Post . " He ambles up the walk , grinning broadly as he leans forward to kiss her . She swivels out of the way of his lips , and he misses her mouth and grazes the corner of her nose . Her shock is instantly replaced by an outrage so fierce she trembles . " You 've been drinking . " A sharp pain stabs at her temples as she shoves him away . He stumbles backward , reaching out for the post of the gas lamp . Just in time , he steadies himself against the flowerpot to break his fall . Okay , so this is what I was dreading , this is what had to go wrong . She should be furious , wild with anger , but oddly she feels relief . She does n't like it , hates it , in fact , but this she can deal with . She can explain this away to jack Cleary  --  an accident , Martin 's poor aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because he 's not going with her to that house , not with all those eyes watching him . She wo n't take the chance that Johnny will make a deadly mistake  --  an inconsistency in their story , an inability to stand without swaying . And they 'll smell the alcohol as easily as she has . u  | Even if he does n't do something utterly stupid , his drinking will be a deadly strike against them . She 's going alone . " What , Val ? What did you do that for ? " The linden tree casts dappled shadows that hood his eyes in darkness . " You 've been drinking , Johnny . " " Only one , Val . Only a beer . " He moves toward her , his hands in his pockets , diffident , boyish . Dangerous . He plants himself in front of her , tears in his eyes , the king of bad judgment transformed into the master of regret . " Get out of my way . And do n't follow me or I 'll call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . " Russo would do that for her , or Gallagher , if she can reach them . " You told me you were sober for nearly a year . Great time you picked to break your dry spell , Johnny . I do n't care if it was just this once , you 're a liar and you 're not ready to accept responsibility for yourself , never mind an eighteen-month-old child . I wo n't risk losing Joanna to save your ego , or whatever it is that made you think you could get away with it . You 're not coming with me , Johnny . Now , get out of my way . " To her amazement , Johnny Starr backs down the sidewalk and lets her pass . " I 'm going to that house , " he says under his breath , " and I 'm going to be part of Joanna 's life . " The curtain parts in the living-room window , and Nadia 's face appears from behind the thick floral drapes . The housekeeper looks like one of those coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching piece . The half face turns back to the room , reporting to Antonia , no doubt , and then the curtain falls shut . " No , Johnny , you 're not going . What 's your name ? Where do you come from ? What 's wrong with your aunt ? " If she had her hands on her hips , if she were shaking her head and wagging her finger in his face , she 'd look just like the kindergarten teacher she sounds like . Have they always chosen these roles : bad boy , reproving grownup ? " Monroe . Michael Monroe . And I 'm from ? " His face is bright with consternation and he looks away . " It was just two beers , Val . I 'm all right now and I 'll be perfect by the time we get there . " Now it 's two beers . Whatever the real number , it does n't matter .  | He 's not going . No way . Martin Monroe is about to be unavoidably detained . " You remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car and then drove away ? " he asks . " And you said you believed in forgiveness ? That everyone is entitled to their mistakes ? " " And do you remember the night you told me I could have my heart 's desire , that you 'd do anything I requested , no questions asked ? The game of Anything . If you 're going to bring up the past , Johnny , I 'd like to remind you that I never collected . " As soon as the words are out , she wishes she could snatch them back . That was another life , one they no longer share . The game of Anything  --  she has n't thought about it in years . She had suggested they play the local version of Truth or Dare , and Johnny agreed , as long as she was It first . " I want to know the saddest thing that ever happened to you , " he 'd demanded , and after she pulled on her socks and shoes because her feet were cold in the damp evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was seven years old , Wildflowers coloring book and all her crayons spread out on the kitchen table , not really paying attention to the strange man at the back door until she realized what he was saying to her mother . Her father was dead . He 'd been taken from the speedway to the hospital , but he was dead before they put him in the ambulance . Seething with anger at her father 's desertion and at her mother , who just slumped into a chair and sat there for an eternity after the man left , she 'd kept her head down and stabbed at the coloring book with the red crayon until her arm ached . Then she 'd turned to a new page and colored the petals and the leaves and the butterfly 's patterned wings , colored them black with meticulous precision . When it was her turn to ask Johnny for Anything , she 'd been too exhausted to collect . " That 's not fair , Val . " His cheeks are flushed , as though he 's been stung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that house , but it 's not because you want me to stay away . I can see you 're right , that I might mess up . I do n't . . . I ca n't ... " " I 'll walk you to the subway , Johnny . I 'll wait with you for your train . " And make sure you get on it going in the right direction . Back  | where you came from . Rage swells inside her , a glass bubble in her chest that 's about to shatter and cut her with slivers of regret and fear . " Do n't . Give me that , at least . I am going back . Let me go alone . " His face is gray now , defeated , and she resists the impulse to hurt him with more words . " Go home , Johnny . " He walks toward the Plaza in a dispirited shuffle , crossing one corner , then another , until finally he 's lost behind a covey of bicy-cle-riding children in the distance . When she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prospect Park West behind a silver-haired woman struggling with a Jack Russell terrier who seems determined to pull her into the middle of the street . " You just remember you 're the dog and I 'm the master , " the woman mutters as Valerie passes them . It 's all a matter of control . At Ninth Street , Valerie stops at the monument guarding the entrance to the park . A squirrel , its tail a forlorn imitation of the brushy curl she expects , watches her from the crotch of a tree limb bright with green leaves . In a blink , it scurries around to the other side of the trunk and winds its way into higher branches , as though it wo n't be visible if it does n't take a direct route . By the time she 's reached Albemarle Road her story is fixed firmly in her mind . She 's become Alice Monroe again . She 's ready for whatever is going to happen in the big white house .  | Jack Cleary 's face is perfectly neutral , the set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He must have practiced that uninflected expression in front of a mirror thousands of times before he got it right . It 's meant to keep her guessing , she 's certain , and it would be wasted effort to try to figure out what it means . Alice Monroe would n't notice , would simply accept what she sees . Alice Monroe 's a good girl , distracted by thoughts of her injured husband . " Well , I do hope he 'll be all right . Methodist Hospital , is that what you said ? They 've got fine doctors , especially in the emergency room . He 'll be fine . " For the first time since her arrival , Cleary smiles . " I think he will . It was awful , though , a pretty bad cut . " Valerie maintains the worried frown , concern for her poor husband who was rushed to the hospital after suffering a deep gash on his shin from a chain saw that ran away from him while he was cutting down a dead tree in his invalid aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder and guides her into the next room . Helen and Arnold Lewiston and Colleen and Patrick Barnes stand two by two beside the fireplace as she 's led to the sofa .  | This was supposed to be a private interview , just the Clearys and the Monroes . What are the others doing here ? The edge of a glossy photograph peeks out from the top of the manila folder in the center of the coffee table . Valerie twines her fingers together to keep from reaching over and snatching it up . " As you can imagine , " she says , her voice quavery with emotion , " Martin really wanted to be here . We 're both so anxious to hear your decision . " Jack Cleary stiffens . She 's pushing it again , changing the tempo , stealing control from the maestro . But it 's done , and she ca n't take the words back . A car blasting reggae rolls by outside ; the vibrations rise up through the floor , up the legs of the chair , thrumming insistently into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you think your place is by his side ? " Cleary 's standing now , not quite looming over her , but she has to look up to follow him as he moves toward her . He stops at the edge of the rug . " Martin made me leave , " Valerie improvises , grateful for the hours of practice spinning tales for Antonia . " I went with him to the hospital . The doctor told me he needed ten stitches and a tetanus shot and the cut had to be cleaned up . He wo n't be discharged from the emergency room for another few hours , the doctor said . I could n't do anything but hang around in the waiting room until then anyway . Martin was really upset that both of us might miss the meeting . He made me promise to come here . To represent us . " " Well , I can understand that . Now , let 's get to the business of the evening . " Jack Cleary signals his wife with a nod of his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Patrick Barnes rises . The fearless leader has n't spoken to him directly or even looked his way , but it 's clear he 's been given some silent , prearranged cue . Barnes takes up his position in the doorway , hands clasped in front of him , a mannequin at attention . " You came to us because those people in Montana sent you here , is n't that right , Mrs. Monroe ? The Stevens family , friends of the Murphys . That 's what you told us ? " As Jack Cleary speaks , Arnold Lewiston joins Patrick Barnes . Now they look like soldiers guarding the entrance to Fort Knox or something . p 207 This is a new script . She 'll have to hit her marks by feel . " Yes , that 's how I knew to look in the back page of the Village Voice to find out about DASH meetings . " Just answer his questions . Be a good girl . She reaches into her purse for a tissue , coughs discreetly behind it , and manages to blot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're here because you have a heartfelt interest in children . In making sure they do n't have the same terrible experiences you did as a child . You want to protect the children . You and your husband do . " Cleary 's pacing now , marching back and forth in front of her , staring down at the carpet . " Yes , that 's right . I ? " He whirls around and holds his hand out . " You do understand that there 's a reason this organization exists . Evil is being courted by certain people who seek power over the good . These people live to satisfy their own dirty , shameful impulses by enlisting the help of Satan , by becoming his agents and thereby giving up their right to live among the decent , God-fearing Christians of this country . " Jack Cleary speaks so softly she has to strain to hear him , yet he 's on fire . His voice bums ; his eyes radiate a passion she 's only imagined in the expressions of the Salem magistrates she 's studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in their hands . " Do you know what happens to people who think they can fool God 's agents ? We can not allow that to happen . Divine justice will make sure the liars and hypocrites are given their due in the eternal suffering that will be their lot , but we must see that earthly justice is meted out first . " " Mr. Cleary , I do n't know what you 're ? " " We must be sure ! " His voice thunders across the room and his face twists into a grotesque mask . " We can not send a child into greater peril . It 's hushed up , taken care of by the social workers . They 're all in on it . The judges , the judges especially . They sit there in their robes and make sure we look like fools because they ca n't wait to get home to their own disgusting rituals . " Panting , his eyes wild , he crosses the room . " How do we know you 're not one of them , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies to be killed on the altar of the devil . A self-ordained priestess with the power to decide that a poor little five-year-old boy who ca n't  | protect himself should be forced to wring a chicken 's neck until the warm blood spurts all over . Into his eyes and up his nose , so he ca n't breathe , and then to cleanse him , oh yes , that 's what they call it , cleansing , they burn the sin away with cigarettes and whip him with green branches until the blood runs down his buttocks . How do we know , Mrs. Monroe ? " His anguish is real , an awful , raw wound that has turned gangre-nous . Murmurs of agreement fill the room , small snuffling sounds from Arnold Lewiston , but Valerie holds herself apart from the sympathy . Whatever his experiences , however he was scarred as a young child , whether by some lunatic devil-worshipers or some unbalanced relative , Cleary has committed himself to fighting a conspiracy of dark-ness  --  and Joanna has become one of his casualties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't stand to think of what happened to . . . those children . Please , please , just let me take care of this child who 's in danger . " He shakes his head . " Not good enough , " he says , and her heart turns to ice . The other men disappear from the doorway , and a trio appears in their place , specters draped in long white robes , heavy crucifixes dangling from braided silk cords around their necks . They hold small carved boxes of different shapes in their hands . One of them steps behind Jack Cleary and pulls the curtains closed . She must go through with this overheated drama they 've prepared for her . It 's a test , and she 's going to pass it . And her reward will be Joanna . In the semidarkness the white robes flutter silently toward her , spirits drifting without weight across the thick carpet . All right , she 's going to be fine . Pamela Cleary  --  she 's the tallest of the three , those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair while the other two hold hands and stand at attention in front of the drawn drapes . " Lord , we commend ourselves to You for Your blessing and purification , so that we may find the way to serve You this evening and discover the truths You allow us to see . We ask that You give us the strength to perform Your work with love in our hearts and wisdom as our guide . We do this so that we may help the children . "  | As the figures glide toward her , she pictures Joanna in Helen Lewiston 's arms . Her breath aches in her chest . One of the three robed women strikes a long wooden match against a fireplace brick . It flares in the darkness , throwing undulating shadows against the wall and filling the room with a sulfurous stink . The woman touches the flame to the three candles on the mantel  --  why has n't she noticed them until now ? ? and an eerily festive light brightens the room . The shortest one  --  Colleen Barnes , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstretched and rising , as though she intends to levitate the sofa . The hood falls away from Colleen 's face as she lifts her arms higher . In the candlelight , her eyes glow red . Whether those eyes are glazed with drugs or holy awe , the woman 's in a state of ecstasy ; it trembles in her voice as she commands Valerie to rise . This is an initiation , some weird pledge night in this sorority of the convened . That 's better  --  thinking about it that way helps . Those high school girls used to spend hours coming up with stupid , demeaning tests for all the silly , eager applicants . This test is no different , except she 's no giggling schoolgirl and there 's more at stake than the right to wear some cheap piece of jewelry . Alice Monroe will get through this just fine . " Kneel in front of the candles . " This from Colleen Barnes . Surprising to hear such a direct command from that mousy little person who would n't even look at her the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get from ano-nymity . The sound of children 's voices laughing and shouting at their twilight games startles her . They 're out on the street , unaware of what 's happening just a few feet away . Who 's protecting them ? She hopes they 've learned how to do that for themselves . " Kneel . " This time the command is sharper . She walks to the spot designated by the pointing finger and sinks to her knees . Instead of letting her mind go blank with fear , she commands herself to stay alert , to think not only like Alice Monroe but also like Valerie Vincent , the woman determined to get her daughter back .  | Three pairs of shoes  --  she can tell which is which . Helen Lewis-ton 's high-shined brown loafers approach until Valerie can almost see her face reflected in the gleaming leather surface . " First we offer a prayer to the goodness of God to direct us to the truth . " Pamela Cleary is still standing in front of the fireplace . The guttering candles spin glinting lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is struck , and the heavy perfume of incense drifts down on a cloud of smoke . Are n't these women even a little embarrassed to be playing dress-up ? Surely they can see that all this ceremonial nonsense is just a device to whip them into the proper frenzy , to give them the courage to perform someone else 's dirty little secret rituals . She turns when she hears footsteps behind her , but a hand splays out on her head and forces her to face front . The brown loafers straddle her kneeling form . Two hands appear , a piece of black cloth suspended between them . Before Valerie can protest , a blindfold is slipped over her eyes and fastened at the back of her head by deft fingers . Antonia ca n't see but she listens better than most people . Despite her physical limitations , Antonia manages to carry off an air of mastery . It 's not just her money and the worldly knowledge she 's acquired . The woman exudes authority , and everyone around her knows she 's no fool just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor behind her ; a slight breeze stirs the air beside her face . Crepe-soled pumps : Colleen . Valerie 's spirits are buoyed ; she can do this , she 's certain of it now . " Rise . " Behind her , Pamela Cleary touches her shoulder and then lifts her hand away . Valerie stands up , spine straight , head high , shoulders pushed back . Joanna 's image shimmers in the void before her , and Valerie resists the impulse to rub her throbbing knees , which ache from playing supplicant . " You must understand , " Pamela says firmly , " that we are doing this only because we must . We can not allow an emissary of the darkness to come into our midst . For our own protection and to protect the children . " There it is again ; the phrase makes Valerie 's teeth clench . p 211 " Remove your clothes . I pray God clear you if you be innocent , and if you be guilty , discover you . " Valerie Vincent recognizes those centuries-old words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A month ago she copied the passage into her notebook from the trial transcripts . She 's about to undergo an examination .  | " I do n't understand what you said . You want me to . . . " She must delay them while she remembers the procedures . They 'll look for devil 's marks , witches ' tits , places on her body where the devil would suckle . Nothing as ordinary as a breast . A mole or a discoloration of the skin . Everyone has moles ; she has several on her arms , a small one on her upper lip , but they 'll be looking for hidden places . On her abdomen , to the right of her navel and an inch or so lower . It was how she decided whether or not to buy a bikini  --  if the mole showed , she 'd feel too exposed . And on her back , below her shoulder blade , a place that Johnny used to kiss after they 'd made love and were drifting off to sleep . How many more ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing . And she 'll stand here and bear it , for Joanna . " Do n't be alarmed . We 've all been through this , " another voice explains  --  Colleen  --  although it 's hard to be sure because the sound is muffled as it comes through the woman 's hood . " We have to make sure you do n't have any devils ' markings . It wo n't take long ; then we can go on to the real reason we 're all here . " Thank God , Mitch Russo did n't let her wear the wire to this meeting . p 213 She reaches for her top button , fingers trembling , girding herself against what she knows is coming . Martha Starr had looked at those hatpins on her desk so lovingly . In the Salem courtroom , girls shrieked about a witch causing apparitions to fly through the air and splash milk from oaken buckets onto the walls of a cottage kitchen , then watched gleefully as the jury of goodwives examined the accused for marks of the devil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden to speak the words every schoolchild has been taught . Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be Thy name , Thy kingdom come , Thy will be done , On earth as it is in heaven . What 's the rest ? She tries humming the tune to herself , gets to the same point and stops . Her blouse is open now and she 's shivering with cold . Give us this day our daily bread And forgive us our debts . . . or is it our sins or our trespasses ? What version will they want to hear ? What comes after that ? Lead us not into temptation . . . She 'll never get through it . Maybe they wo n't ask . And deliver us from evil . This is the evil she needs to be saved from . If God or Kevin Murchison or Antonia Carrera or even Johnny Starr could help her now , she 'd accept it gratefully . But she 's going to have to do this on her own . She reaches back to unzip her skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently aside . Light seeps in from the bottom of the blindfold ; at least she can get a bearing on her examiners . Cleary in front of her , Lewiston to her left . That means Colleen Barnes , slight and timid , is behind her . " I do n't really have to take off my bra or my panties . " Defiant . Her voice has that ring to it , she can hear it , and it might make them bolder . Beneath the blindfold , she opens her eyes wide . They 'll expect her to cry , that 's one of the proofs , witches ca n't cry . Her  | detachment wo n't serve her well . She has to give them at least a couple of tears . Without warning , she feels the first jab . She jumps back , clutching her arm , feeling the dampness on her skin . She 's bleeding on cue , proof of her innocence  --  witches ' tits never bleed . " What 's going on ? " she demands , as though she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst of it , Alice . Just a few more minutes . " And then she 's stuck again from behind , right under the shoulder blade . This time her yelp of pain and outrage is louder and she dances away , only to be shoved forward by hands against her back . Another poke , then another , and now she 's in the same fury she felt when she was nine and a group of sixth-grade boys snatched her sweater and played Monkey-in-the-Middle until she realized the only way to make them leave her alone was to stop trying to get her sweater , stop attempting to kick them or hit them . They wanted her to cry , that was all , and she would n't . But she will now , because she needs to prove she 's human , not an instrument of evil , not a dark visitation on this bright earth . Because Joanna needs her tears . " Please , " she whispers , " please stop . " She blinks her eyes hard beneath the black rag that 's tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the flickering light . Someone 's holding a candle so close she 's afraid it will burn her , and she thinks of Esther , all ashes and memories now , and the tears start down her cheeks . Before she can reach up to wipe her face , someone covers her bare shoulders with soft fabric , her own blouse , probably . It 's almost over , she 's passed this part of the test , there 's only a little more she 'll have to do . And then they 'll tell her how to get her daughter back . They do n't know it , but that 's exactly what they 'll do . " All right , you can get dressed now . " She reaches up to remove the blindfold , but a gentle hand on her arm warns her away . " Not yet . One more thing , Alice , and then we 'll be done . " Articles of clothing are placed in her hands , and she 's helped into her blouse and then her skirt . What else can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her skirt when she hears an insistent rap on the door . No one in the room moves . Then she hears footsteps , low voices , a sharp exchange . Something 's gone wrong . She reaches out in front of her , groping for a wall , the fireplace , a person . Her hand brushes something cylindrical , cold metal , scored vertically . The floor lamp  --  she 's been turned around so completely she 's in the opposite corner of the room . No one has stopped her , no one seems to be paying attention to her . She reaches for the blindfold and pulls it down . Jack Cleary and the trio of robed women huddle together in the doorway . His eyes meet hers and he stops talking , his whispered tirade interrupted . The women turn , puppets moving in unison , and she yanks off the black cloth . Where did she leave her purse ? It does n't matter . She has to get out of here . Her mind races in a hundred directions , slams into obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle things . " What happened ? " she asks quietly . " Is something wrong ? " " There 's been no Martin Monroe at the emergency room . In fact , no one 's been admitted to the Methodist Hospital ER with a chainsaw wound in two months . " Jack Cleary advances toward her , his face a chiaroscuro study where the candlelight catches on his chin or slides off into darkness . " You lied to us , Mrs. Monroe . Why did you do that ? " " Mr. Cleary , I do n't know who you talked to , but I resent you saying I 'm lying . Maybe no one 's told the switchboard operator , maybe the doctor listed my husband 's injury as something else ? " And if she can say that aloud , she 'd better react to the possibility . Her hand flies to her mouth and she shakes her head . " I 'm sorry , but this is very upsetting . His aunt might have heard from him . Do you mind if I call to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good . All she needs is fifteen seconds , and then she 's out of here . " Fine . You can use this phone . " He flips on the ceiling light and points to an old Princess phone , pink and scuffed , on the end table near the sofa
