The Gold Ring THE GOLD RING on the carousels was made of brass . Even as kids in Coney Island we did n't believe it was the real thing . By the time we 'd grown old enough to ride the outside horses and lunge out sideways to grasp the metal rings that swung toward us for the final few rotations , the carousel was no longer enchanting and we had no deep desire for the free ride that the last , lucky gold one awarded . By then we had nickels enough to go around again if we wanted to , but we tended to spend them on attractions that were higher and faster , more spectacular -- roller coasters -- and , for fun , the electric bump-cars . We were luckier with the staying power of our craving for things like pretzels , potato chips , jelly doughnuts , and chocolate bars . Mark Twain is said to have remarked that by the time we 're tall enough to reach the jar of jam on the high shelf of the cupboard , we find that we 've lost our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or my friends or any in the small family of four of which I was the youngest , not with edibles like halvah or salted peanuts , ice cream , kosher corned beef and hot dogs , or even salami sandwiches . When we found ourselves with enough cash to obtain as much of these delicacies as we wanted , we still had a hearty appetite for them , and we tended to indulge ourselves , and still do , by eating as much as , sometimes more , much more , than we truly did , and do , want . Of late , my best defense against corpulence has been to keep out of the house supplies of things to eat that reason cautions I should n't be stuffing into myself . Pistachio nuts , for instance , whether in petite jars or five-pound bags , have a feeble chance of extended survival once I discover them close at hand . If there 's ice cream in the freezer , I feel a commanding moral responsibility to move it out of the house as quickly as I 'm able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've discovered that salty pretzels go very well with just about any dessert I am likely to have at home . They 're also good by themselves . If , before going to bed , I happen to remember we have sliced turkey breast in the refrigerator , the odds are heavy that I 'll put some in my mouth as I find my way into the bathroom to brush my teeth -- on a couple of crackers , of course , or half a flat of pita bread , with salt and mustard . But it 's ice cream that still tastes most wonderful and is richest in evocative associations extending backward in time almost to the formation of memory itself , to brands and items long extinct -- to Dixie cups , for example , with their prized photographs of cowboy movie stars on the inside of the lid under a transparent waxed-paper seal . Like the evocations of the cookie to Proust , a meditation on ice cream soon takes me back to the age of eight or nine and into a family setting in which a small container is shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sister , a brother , and me . ( I was by many years the youngest . ) In summer , ice cream was everywhere . In autumn , though , after the change back from daylight saving time , and even in winter on a black night after dinner and before bedtime , the idea of ice cream might be voiced , taking on a sacramental meaning to our small family in our small apartment -- four rooms , looking out on West 31st Street near Surf Avenue in Coney Island . My mother -- finally relaxing in front of the radio with the rest of us , after shopping for dinner , preparing dinner , serving dinner , and cleaning up in the kitchen after dinner -- might say with her Jewish intonations that she would certainly very much welcome the taste of a little ice cream . We had no refrigerator then , no freezer -- no family living in our apartment building did -- and there would be no ice cream in the house . At that late hour only the soda fountain in a drugstore two blocks away was open . I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a dime to bring back a container . The flavor of our unanimous choice in those years was called Golden Glow . It 's hard today to believe that just half a pint of bulk ice cream could have been so satisfying to the four of us , but that 's all , as I recall , that a dime paid for . More than a dime for ice cream they could n't bring themselves to spend . We were prudent with money because we did n't have much , but I , the " baby " in the family , was never allowed to feel that . MY SISTER , SYLVIA , was seven years older than I. My brother ? Lee , originally Eli , born in Russia and brought to this country at the age of six , was seven years older than she was . In reality , they were only my half brother and half sister , the children of my father and his first wife , who had died . My mother was therefore a stepmother to them . They were , I realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said so , they must have felt at least a little like orphans . I was , then , the baby in the family , treated by everyone , in effect , like an only child , which in some ways I was . I had no inkling of these family relationships until I was well into my teens , and I was shocked nearly speechless when confronted by the discovery , which unfolded at my brother 's wedding . There , my mother 's role in the procession down the aisle was to walk behind him , alone , and I listened dumbfounded to the officiating rabbi praise her so generously for the loving care she had given the groom , the son who was not biologically her own , and the daughter , too . I felt victimized , disgraced . My response to rage then , as it chiefly is still , was to break off speaking to the person offending me . I stopped speaking to my sister one time when she took up cigarettes and another time when she bleached her hair . And this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possibly with so deep and vindictive a hurt that I would obstinately refuse to tell any of them the cause , for that would be speaking . My oldest friend in the world , Marvin Winkler , with whom as an infant I had often been lodged together in a playpen , was amazed not long ago when I recalled the incident and related my stunned reaction . He was puzzled by my surprise , for he had been informed of the relationship by his mother when he was still a child and cautioned against hurting my feelings by bringing it up . My sister , too , was taken aback to read my account of this event in a biographical piece about me for which she had also been interviewed . She , along with my mother and my brother , had simply assumed , she claimed , that I 'd known all along . It was not a scandal , not even a secret . They did n't talk about it because there was no need to . On the other hand , I know it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all to me about my father , least of all about an earlier marriage , until out of curiosity as an adult I began to inquire . And only once did my mother talk to me about him , volunteering the information that my father could eat a whole chocolate cake at a single sitting -- as a delivery driver for a wholesale bakery firm , cakes were easy for him to obtain -- and that before he went into the hospital with a bleeding gastric ulcer , his stool was as black as coal . She told me this as an admonition against my own appetite , for I could always eat as much cake as was given me , and still want more . I discovered early in life that shelled walnuts in a bowl of raisins make a lovely late-evening treat for uninterrupted munching till bedtime . I once overheard my mother recounting that when I was a nursing infant , she had to tear me away from the breast , for I would never finish , and I can believe her . DIFFERENT AS EACH OF US was from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did n't want to talk about , we were , and functioned as , a close family . It was not in our nature to complain , quarrel , demand , or gossip . I remember a number of tantrums I discharged as a juvenile , but I believe that from the time I was an adolescent , I had acquired the family 's stoic , resigned , and undemanding nature and did n't complain , quarrel , or gossip , either , My mother , finding herself after six years of marriage a widow with three children , two of them not naturally her own , had brought us up as the mother of us all , and my brother and sister had related to her as such . My brother , I learned , had at one time saved up money enough to buy her a better radio . The gift was poignantly apt , for my mother loved melodic music , Puccini arias in particular . And in those days of radio entertainment , amid the glorious profusion of comedy and variety shows , there was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other light classical pieces . Although the period was one of severe economic depression , everybody sooner or later seemed able to find employment . By the time I started school , my brother , fourteen years older than I , was already working at a brokerage in Wall Street as a customer 's man , a job for which he was to prove ill suited by his modest manner and unaggressive temperament , and by a disposition to be continually obliging to others . My sister , after graduating from high school and encountering a number of startling rebuffs at employment agencies , would eventually find herself starting at R. H. Macy 's department store , where she would remain for something like forty years . And I at sixteen , after classes at high school , would be cutting a dashing figure in a khaki quasi-military uniform as a part-time messenger boy delivering telegrams for Western Union , in office buildings in Manhattan weekdays , on a bicycle weekends to residences in Brooklyn , and mostly exulting in my duties with a sense of adventure and attentive curiosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dressmaker before her marriage , worked steadily at home at her sewing machine mending garments for neighbors and doing alterations for a cousin , Sadie Pacon , who owned a dress shop on Gravesend Neck Road in lower Flatbush nearby . She also found steady work at home from laundries , turning frayed collars on men 's shirts so that , from the outside and at the neck at least , the shirts looked almost good as new . Some weekend nights , mainly Saturdays , my brother would find extra income filling in at a catering hall for some banquet , dressing up appropriately for his suave role in the cloakroom or as one of the hall 's hosts greeting and directing arriving guests . Neighbors outside the apartment building seeing him depart in a tuxedo or a natty , double-breasted , summer sport jacket might remark that he was off on a heavy date . But I knew he was going to work . My mother liked to read . In Europe , her family had been bookbinders . From the Coney Island public library I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially Anna Karenina , with which she had long been familiar , and thought Dostoyevsky was crazy . Her brother ( my Uncle Sam ) late in life was employed repairing books for the library of Brandeis University , where his son , Harry Stein , a varsity player in James Madison High School in Brooklyn and City College in New York , was one of the athletic coaches . When my mother noticed an apple turning soft she would briskly plan a noodle pudding that made use of it rather than have it go to waste . She took threadbare bedsheets to her scissors and her sewing machine and converted them into window curtains . ( Often , as her eyesight weakened with age , I would help with the sewing by threading her needle . Today I would not be able to . ) If brother and sister had quarreled , she would n't let them go to bed until they had talked it out and made peace . She was never more happy than when a friend from the old country appeared unexpectedly . The visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My sister 's clothing as a teenager in high school , she recalls , came to her mainly as hand-me-downs from an older first cousin , who , because she was already at work in a business with her father , favored dresses of dark color , which my mother altered to fit . She also remembers feeling endlessly self-conscious , because she wore dresses rather than the skirts with blouses or sweaters fashionable among her schoolmates . Widowed twice , she is esteemed by a stepdaughter from her first marriage and by the three children from her second , all of them grown now . For a little while , far back before the age of sixteen , out of eagerness more than need , I hawked newspapers in the early evening , peddling the next morning 's editions the night before , crying , " Mexican , News , and Mirror ; morning pape ' ! " The American , a Hearst newspaper more reactionary than his Mirror ; was thicker than the others , cost more , and had few readers in the Italian and Jewish neighborhoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other newsboys who were trying desperately to keep ahead of me . I soon dropped that heavier paper from my inventory , and my sales cry became " Hey , get your morning News and Mirror ; morning pape ' ! " At best this was very small stuff , and I was lucky if I earned as much as a dollar . I bought the papers for a penny and a half , I think I remember , and sold them for two cents each , hoping for an occasional tip of a penny or two . People who wanted both might give me a nickel . I bought the papers from trucks near the subway station at Stillwell Avenue , usually eating a frankfurter while I waited for them to arrive , and wended my way home on a route along the boardwalk and the populous avenues of Surf and Mermaid in the hope that my last batch would be entirely gone by the time I got there . If not , a humorous , audacious plea to neighbors sitting outside their houses might do the trick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " was one shouted ploy to command immediate attention . Any papers that remained I might give away to mothers and fathers there who were my favorites . A wondrous incident remains indelibly alive -- it occurred only one time . At a boardwalk Irish bar one night , a thin man sitting alone at a table beckoned to me and reached out for one of my papers . As I stood there and waited in suspense , he opened it from the back , studying the racing results a few moments , and then returned it . And then he gave me a dime and wanted no newspaper . I was in heaven , strolling on air as I went back outside . I was in love with a world that had such humans in it . From repeated personal experience I 've learned that few pleasures are so thoroughly reinforcing to the spirit as the arrival of unexpected money . Not long ago , I was amazed to receive in the mail , with no advance word , a royalty check from my literary agent for almost $18,000 , representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my novels in East Germany . I had long since forgotten that I 'd even had a novel published there , and for the next hour or so I found myself grinning and humming a happy show tune or two . But I doubt very much that the sensation of well-being I experienced from this relatively huge windfall surpassed the joy brought me by that ten-cent gift I once received as a newsboy . It feels now as though that dime meant enormously more to me , and perhaps it did . Each of these benign surprises affecting me was a rapture someone born rich is not likely ever to enjoy . There are some pleasures money ca n't buy . OUR STREET AND neighborhood felt safe , insular , and secure , to a child an ethnic stronghold . Just about all the parents were immigrants , the majority from Eastern Europe . There was nothing and no one to fear physically . I did not really know who Hitler was . Our elders did , but I doubt that even they , or anyone , could have guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to set loose . I remember a day : It is late afternoon , and I can hear again the newspaper vendors tearing through our street with their high-pitched cries and their " extra " editions of the papers with glaring headlines announcing that Hindenburg had resigned as president of Germany to make way for Hitler as chancellor . They knew they would sell every copy that day , whereas I did n't know who Hindenburg was . Until much later , I thought he was a zeppelin . There was just about no fear of violence in that part of Coney Island where I lived and grew up . And there was practically no crime , unless one considers the peddling of ice cream or soft drinks on the beach a criminal activity -- the police did , but we didn't -- or later on , approaching the years of the war and to a broader extent afterward , the possession and smoking of marijuana . I did n't consider using marijuana a crime , either , although I never wanted to become " schooled " to be what was called a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even knew about the increasing prevalence of this activity , and my mother would have been of a disapproving mind toward anything thought wrong . Then after the war came heroin . In the nineteen years I lived on that street before going into the army -- except for two months away as a blacksmith 's helper in a southern navy yard , I lived nowhere else -- I never heard of a rape , an assault , or an armed robbery in our neighborhood . I do recall having heard of a hookmaker shot to death in a poolroom , but that was on West 25th Street , six blocks away , on the very border between the Jewish and Italian sections . It was n't really in our neighborhood , although we were eventually using that spot as a meeting place and the most convenient site for placing our bets on professional baseball games . It was run by a short , squat man called Sammy the Pig . The poolroom nearer my home was owned and run by a man we knew as Weepy . Nicknames were legion in Coney Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy Foofsen , an older youth , was already Sammy Fifteen by the time I heard of him . A little while later , even his nickname acquired a nickname : He was referred to as Six-Six-Three . These mutations in title appeared to arise and take hold quite naturally , as though by spontaneous generation ; no one person originated them . A guy called Chicago was Chi , then Shy . Mursh the Cripple had a leg in a clumsy metal brace from polio . In time , Mursh the Cripple matured into Mursh the Hopper . He was older , too -- one of the first guys we knew in Coney Island to own a car ; it was an automobile with just hand controls . And a prank of his was to sit in the space beside the driver 's seat , staring straight ahead with a placid smile and , with no person behind the wheel , operate the car with manual movements below the dashboard that were n't visible to disbelieving other drivers or pedestrians , who , startled , usually looked twice . My friend Marvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferable to Marvin . Murray Rabinowitz was Rup since childhood , in honor of his early surgery for a hernia , known then as a " rupture . " Danny Rosoff was Danny the Count . Squeezy and Frenchy were two girls -- I do n't know how they came to merit such racy monikers . Danny the Bull , another fellow my age , was given that name before the war because of his broad chest and muscular shoulders . After the war , he was soon rendered frail and woeful by an addiction to heroin . His father , a barber named Max , gave him a cruel new title , derogating him to customers in his shop as My Son the Junkie . THE LONE ACT of violence affecting me was one I unconsciously took pains not to find out much about until I was well into my thirties , and that was the death of my father in a hospital -- from internal bleeding after surgery for a condition that today I imagine would likely be considered almost routine , his bleeding ulcer . I prefer to believe that these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery rooms standard , the falling open of his stitches would have been detected in time and that he would have survived . I was just past five . I knew he was gone -- I do n't remember that I was ever told , I just knew -- but I had no notion of the cause . For thirty years I did n't care to ask . I did n't dare ? It was n't a secret . I did n't know , I eventually recognized in one startling moment -- and it came to me in an illuminating burst of understanding -- because I had never wanted to ask ; they did n't tell me , I guess , because with the passing of years they simply assumed I knew . It was not a gratifying subject for family discussion . The impact upon my brother and sister -- losing both parents in so short a time and finding themselves in the care of a stepmother they had known only six years -- would have been enormous . But not only did we not complain much in my family , we did n't talk much about anything deeply felt . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ever was I present when one of us shed a tear , at the funeral of a spouse . And that 's about all it was , a tear . About my father , I simply lost interest in him after he was gone . Later on -- outside the family , of course -- it became a conceit of personality to assert impertinently when the subject arose that I never missed him , and I do n't believe I did . I did n't have that tender admiration for a large and generous nature that Nabokov expresses for his father . I hardly knew mine at all . If anything , the passing away of Mr. Isaac Daniel Heller was for me more a matter of embarrassment than anything else . At the beginning of each term in elementary school , it was the procedure of the teacher to call the children one by one to the desk in front of the classroom to obtain information that included the father 's name and perhaps his occupation . Someone , teacher or sister , taught me the word deceased . I said it always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame and humiliation , and I hoped none of my classmates would hear . I did not feel I missed him . In later years , I might even wisecrack irreverently when hearing someone talk of an appalling home life caused by a father that I was fortunate mine was gone before he could inflict much damage . But I was biting my fingernails at the age of seven . And except for two hospital confinements very much later , during which my anxieties were focused on inescapable concerns , I have gone on biting them and I still do . In my late teens and afterward , I was suffering headaches before I understood what headaches were . Earlier , when someone spoke of a headache , I had no grasp of what was meant ; once I did get the idea , I realized that I had been having them all along , usually on weekend mornings and afternoons . They 've stopped . I studied my face in the mirror excessively . I had overheard that I was a good-looking child , mostly from repeated comments by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had not changed for the worse . I suffered boils more often than what was considered normal and had a school year of warts : There were seventeen on my hands and arms , including one large flat one on an elbow that did n't disintegrate with the others and had to be burned off by Dr. Abe Levine ( who charged two dollars for the office visit and the treatment ) . I had a crazy fear I was going bald , because the hairline at my forehead was so much higher than at my ears . I did what I conceived I could to " train " my hair , and I moved the part from one side to the other , and then to the center and then off again to the side , and then tried it without a part , plastered flat with a stiffening hair tonic , and then with waves . I did other little things I still would n't want to tell anybody . I measured my height by the level of my eyes and therefore believed dismally that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much shorter than boys who were shorter than I. It was vanity , of course , but I 'm inclined now to believe that it was a very anxious vanity founded on a wobbly formation of what R. D. Laing might have called " ontological insecurity . " I was prone to fantasizing , daydreaming -- and to good effect : I brought my rather overworking imagination into the classroom in book reports and compositions , and in this schoolwork I excelled . I can think of these examples : For a book report on Tom Sawyer in one of the earliest grades I donned the mantle of Tom Sawyer tasked with the assignment of writing a book report on the work in which he is the principal personality ; in the seventh grade , when I was about twelve , for an autobiographical written assignment supposedly by a subject in history . I became , in a first-person account -- not Abraham Lincoln , which would have been ordinary , others would have chosen him -- but the metal in the gun that was used to shoot him . I was born , I remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron ore . Papers like these were read aloud as outstanding , which was the reward I aimed for . I very strongly did want to excel and be noticed . And one time I used some savings to surprise my brother with a gift for Father 's Day . I bought him a carton of cigarettes , Camels , and it cost a dollar then . And I still am unable to decide , aware now of unconscious motivation . whether the deed was one of sincere gratitude and affection or merely a stunt contrived to excite comment and win me some complimentary attention . Or both . Another time , nearing the age of sixty , while experimenting with psychoanalysis as a remedy for alleviating stressful moods in the throes of a rancorous divorce , I had a coherent dream in which my brother , Lee , who then was living and in good health , was dead and resurrected from the grave to rejoin the family in the old apartment house in Coney Island , where my mother , who had long since died , was alive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I protested astutely that I probably would n't have had that dream of my father-as-brother the night before were I not in this treatment and if I had n't known I would be coming to see him that morning . And he , chuckling in his upholstered armchair , did n't disagree , and conceded that the psychoanalytical process was indeed to a large extent " neurogenic , " a word I had not heard before and have not heard since . NOT LONG AFTER my father died , we moved from our old apartment into one of equal size directly across the street , and that is the one I think of as the home in which I grew from childhood . It had four rooms . All of the apartments seemed to have four rooms , one a full kitchen , one a living room that routinely also functioned as somebody 's sleeping place . In spring , with us as with others , the ROOM FOR RENT sign went up , the notice went out to neighbors , and we took in a boarder for the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends or relatives nearby . None of us , not my brother or sister or I , could recall with certainty how we disposed of ourselves for the period in which we gave up that room . My sister does remember a situation in our first apartment with two parents and a child boarding in one room , while one of us slept in the kitchen . She ca n't remember which one of us it was . It was to one of these boarders that I owe my first exposure to classical music . He politely requested permission to tune in to station WNYC on our radio when it was n't in use ( in use by me , usually , listening -- to the despair of my mother -- to big-band swing ) . WNYC was a classical music station . I did n't have to listen when he played the music he preferred , but I did have to hear . And I was overwhelmed when I recognized in these classical performances so many melodies already familiar to me as popular songs from Your Hit Parade and other radio programs : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " You Are perhaps " This Is " My Song of Love , " " The Lamp Is Low , " and a host , more than one host , of others ( " The Isle of May , " " April Showers , " " No Star Is Lost in My Blue Heaven , " Tchaikovsky again , and what appeared to be a genuine Negro spiritual and was , in fact , astonishingly , the largo from Dvorak 's New World symphony , " Going Home " ) . And it was while I was listening alertly to discover more of these that other strains I had n't heard before were played and repeated and became recognizable and appreciated . When families moved from one flat in Coney Island to another , it was mainly to take advantage of the usual " concession "  - -  a rent-free first month or two given to the new tenant . When they moved away from Coney Island into areas of loftier economic standing , it was because they could at last afford to . The clearest memory I preserve of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongings had been transferred , going back with me and bringing a broom to sweep out , still one more time , the corners of all the rooms . He did n't want the new tenants , he explained , to think that the ones preceding them , us , were slobs . He would retain this conscientious and considerate trait , this regard for comportment , till the end of his life . In the new apartment , after being put to bed , I would frequently and furtively imagine , or hope , that a policeman was stationed at each end of our segment of the dark block , keeping vigilant watch on my building and window to safeguard me from -- I can not imagine what . Except for the threat of true poverty , against which I was protectively kept ignorant , there were no dangers . Both inside and outside the house we were safe . There were no kidnappings or burglaries , and always in decent weather there were scores of kids on the street to play with , and grown-ups to watch and keep an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were encouraged , boys and girls , to walk on our own to the grade school close to half a mile away , crossing streets . We walked home for lunch at noon , walked back to school for the afternoon session , returned on foot when classes ended at three , without fear , without harm . Except in summer , there was n't much danger from automobiles ; this was a low-income neighborhood during the Great Depression , and there were n't many automobiles . From about the age of nine or ten , we could play in the street at night or roam the boardwalk until we sagged with sleepiness or someone came to fetch us.
