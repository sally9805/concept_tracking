No high heels , no children under 8 . <p> ( 708 ) 887-7575 . <p> A wealth of design ideas flows through a mansion overlooking ponds , streams and hills , home to this month 's " Gift to Children " designer showcase house in Burr Ridge . <p> The $ 1.2 million mansion in the Falling Water subdivision presents a framework of oak floors and moldings by the acre and lots and lots of windows . On this canvas designers worked their magic with faux painting of every sort , lush fabrics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window treatments . <p> Designer Barbara Mulvihill consulted with drapery specialist Sandra Wesson and came up with an unusual fabric valance that looks like a suspended-in-air length of undulating ribbon . Put some fancier wave shapes into Christmas ribbon candy and you 've got the idea . <p> The fabric is attached with Velcro to the wave-cut edge of a board set horizontally above the top of the windows in the dining room . Beneath the valance , flowing draperies in a print so muted it seems almost like navy and white stripes are caught back with a flap of solid blue fabric . <p> The walls glow with a pale treatment of paint layered with mica , then sealed with five hand-rubbed coats of Italian wax . <p> The kitchen is the center of this house , with most other ground-floor rooms flowing out from it . Walk around the lazy-L-shaped center island with its second sink and you can see out to the foyer , dining room , breakfast room , back hall and family room . Through windows above the wall sink , view the waterfall and pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron epergne on the island with fresh fruits , candles and ivy to provide color against the background of pale oak cabinets . <p> A wide doorway and a picture-window-size opening above a counter both look through to the breakfast room , and across it through walls of windows to the pond . " We wanted the eye to look out the window across the pond , " Marks said . So she kept the windows basically uncovered , just hanging a little swag of soft green gingham above them . <p> Faux bamboo chairs edge a glass-top table set on an oak base with fluted edges , the ensemble standing on a needlepoint rug with many squares , each depicting a different flower . <p> Not all designers adhered to the theme of jewel colors . Some chose jet and alabaster , often with an overlay of gilt . <p> Color does glow in the library , where Robert W. Smith hung the multiangled walls with a Bordeaux red satin-stripe paper , then topped it with a border of red with dull gilt Chinoiserie patterns , on which is superimposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The space above the bay window was too narrow for the wide border , so he hand-cut smaller china plates from a matching paper and pasted them in to fit . A red lacquer Chinese altar table fills a wide niche and supports decorative objects including a blue-and-white , tall ginger jar and many brass candlesticks . <p> Deep red walls in the living room by Pamela Miller Whitehead are set off by raspberry draperies , a raspberry brocade sofa and two black easy chairs . All the furniture looks upholstered but actually is covered with close-fitted slipcovers that can be removed for a seasonal change ( and ease in cleaning ) . <p> The huge family room in the rear corner of the house , by Shirley George of Dale Edmunds Interiors , has walls glazed a soft brown , with a 2-story window framed by a hand-painted border that required three weeks of work . Furniture is cushy white chenille , and the white carpeting that prevails throughout the house is set with two faux leopardskin rugs . <p> Do n't miss the powder room off the foyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big water lilies and a butterfly . When it 's on canvas you can peel it off and take it along to your next house . <p> In the loft overlooking the foyer she hung the walls with sheer gold fabric over a draping of white . A black baby grand piano being played by a computer stands out against white furniture and walls painted gold over white . <p> The prize for charm goes hands down to a little girl 's room by Betsy Fredrickson and Alicia Farrell . Walls with just a drop of pink in the paint sport a few hand-painted flowers , so high they 're almost out of sight where the ceiling angles in to form a tray . They mimic the flowers on a white print comforter on a bed with a white box-pleat skirt and sheets edged with Battenberg lace . <p> An antique christening gown is draped across the foot of the bed and an old pine chest adjoining it . Five flower-print plates are grouped above a desk , and next to a huge armoire are a doll-size dresser and bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is topped by a Battenberg throw . <p> Through the bathroom and into the closet , another doll 's bed and chair sit in a corner , and each brass clothes hook supports a piece of handmade child 's clothing . The most delightful is almost entirely covered with bright cross-stitch patterns . <p> Everything is white , black and gilt in the master bedroom and sitting room . Color returns going down the back hall of the second floor . At one point the hall turns and widens briefly . It was made into a sitting area with a chair whose back is carved like an old French hot-air balloon , and a bombe-front black chest narrowly trimmed with gold and set with candlesticks , including some that act as book ends . <p> A blue bedroom by LeAnn Roe and Susan Conner of Plunkett Furniture features sponge-painted blue and gold walls below the chair rail , and white wallpaper with blue and gilt French Empire decorations above . A white ceiling fan sports an unusual and handsome crystal bowl light fixture , and the high metal four-poster bed has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white toile . <p> The house has two half-baths downstairs , and each of 4 bedrooms upstairs has its own bath . The back bedroom by Darlene McFarlane features a bed covered and draped with a fabric of green and mauve flowers on a white background . Two antique-look bedside tables are hand-painted with flowers . @x QUIRKY PHILANTHROPY AND REFORM THEOLOGY seem unlikely bedfellows , but between them they have created one of the newest and most interesting schools of divinity in the United States . Welcome to Beeson , an increasingly admired evangelical but ecumenical seminary on the campus of Samford University near Birmingham , Alabama . Financially endowed beyond the dreams of most other comparable religious teaching establishments , Beeson celebrates its 21st anniversary this year . It owes its rising reputation to two remarkable founding fathers . The crusty and mildly eccentric benefactor behind the school was Ralph Waldo Beeson ( 1900-1990 ) , a former sales agent for the Liberty National Life Insurance Company ( now Torchmark ) . He bet his life savings on Liberty shares during the stock exchange crash of 1929 , eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s . This made him a fortune of well over $100 million . He spent little of it on himself , living so frugally that his reluctance to buy new trousers became a local legend . Beeson lived in a modest home on Shades Moun- tain overlooking the Samford campus . He donated several new buildings to the university , saying that he liked to look out from his bedroom and keep an eye on his philanthropic investments . By far the most generous of these was his endowment of a new divinity achool with a gift worth more than $70 mil- lion , believed to be the largest ever from a single donor in the history of theological education . In 1988 he attached conditions to his founder 's bequest that have subsequently shaped the school 's scholarship and spirituality . Beeson was brought up as a Methodist- his father 's name was John Wesley Beeson- he married a Baptist , and they became Presbyterians , but he resisted the narrow exclusivism of these traditions . He insisted that his school should be interdenominational and nonsectarian while at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to the heritage of the Reformation . The result is that Beeson today describes itself as " confessional , covenantal , evangelical , ecumenical and reformational , " a combination that exists in no other seminary on an American university campus . Ralph Waldo Beeson requested two other conditions that have proved distinctive for his school . First , that it should stay small , and second , that it should be easily affordable . Under the terms of his will , the student body is limited to a total of 180 . Students pay maximum annual fees of $5,500 , although two-thirds of them make average payments of $1,700 and one-third pay nothing at all . By comp- arison , most other divinity students in peer insti- tutions ( i.e. , Wheaton ; Fuller ; Dallas Theological Seminary ; Gordon-Conwell ) have to pay much higher fees- usually at the $15,000-$20,000 level . Because Beeson is neither driven by enrollment numbers nor constrained by the usual funding pressures , it can afford to aim for excellence in both the selection of its students and the appointment of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as synonymous with the school as the major benefactor 's is its original and only dean , Dr. Timothy George . In the early days he was exhorted by calls from Mr. Beeson in his aerie on Shades Mountain , " Now , Timothy , I want you to keep things orthodox down there .... I want you to train pastors who can preach . " Virtually all the young men and women who graduate from Beeson with its flagship MDiv ( Master of Divinity ) degree go on to become pastors who preach in a wide variety of churches and ministries around the world . They are well grounded in Scripture , as a third of the curriculum is focused on Greek , Hebrew , and biblical studies . The leading lights of the faculty include LyIe Dorsett , who according to his dean " teaches evangelism in a way that brings together the mind of C. S. Lewis and the passion of Richard Baxter , " and Robert Smith Jr. , a renowned preaching lecturer and author of several books on pulpit oratory , including the best-selling Doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I met these and other eminent faculty members , as well as many students , when I recently lectured at Beeson . Modesty compels me to admit that my favorable view of the school may have been influenced by the fact that I was there to receive its annual award in Christian biography for my John Newton : From Disgrace to Amazing Grace ( Crossway , 2007 ) . The institution seems to have quite a niche in Anglophilia , since recent campus speakers from my home country have included Margaret Thatcher , John Major , Chrie Blair , and John Pollock- a far better British biographer than your columnist . But after making allowances for the possibility that the prize ( and the accompanying check ! ) may have provided me with a rose-colored perspective on Beeson , there is at least one more reason why the school is riding so high . It is the scholarship and leadership of its dean , Dr. Timothy George . I FIRST MET TIMOTHY GEORGE five years ago when I was writing another Christian biography , Charles W. Colson : A Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and J. I. Packer were the principal Reformed theologians in the galaxy of professors and pastors assembled by Colson to lead a long-running symposium known as Evangelicals and Catholics Together ( ECT ) . The quality of these scholars was so outstanding ( the principal Catholics were the late and much lamented Cardinal Avery Dulles and Richard John Neuhaus ) that their published delib- erations broke new ecumenical ground . However , ECT 's gentle murmurings about unity were reported on the front page of the New York Times under the ominous headline " How the Evangelicals and Cath- olics Joined Forces . " This cost Colson 's prison minis- try over $1 million in withdrawn donations . Hard-line Reformationists such as R. C. Sproul even claimed that Rome 's denial of the Lutheran doctrine of sola fide ( justification by faith alone ) meant that " the Roman Catholic church is neither a Christian body nor a Christian church . " To his credit , Timothy George stood firm through these bigoted vaporings , and 20 years later ECT continues to make a fine contribution to the cause of interdenominational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the wealth and warm welcome of Beeson lies a dean with a touch of ecumenical steel . He is a distinguished author in his own right , with notable works such as Theology of the Reformers and Is the Father of Jesus the God of Muhammad ? ( answer : no ) . But first and foremost Timothy George is a widevisioned educator of excellence , a successful preparer of pastors , and an internationalist obeyer of Christ 's great commission " Go and make disciples of all nations . " No wonder Beeson 's impact as a divinity school is being felt around the world as well as setting a fast and faithful pace in the groves of theological academe.
