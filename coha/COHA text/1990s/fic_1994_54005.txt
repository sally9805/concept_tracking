IT WAS A STRANGE COMbination , businessman and speculator , collector , lover of baseball . Everyone at the convention had all the elements to some degree , but Curran knew it was a question of which motivation was dominant . If he could find that out , intuit it somehow , discern it , he might get an edge in the bidding . <p> He tried to keep his face impassive during the Lull , tried to stop the fingers on his left hand from tapping the side of his chair , tried to suppress the sweating , the throat clearing , the swallowing , the dozens of silent , auto-nomic betrayals of anxiety . The competition had to believe he was in control , calm , cold-blooded , ruthlessly relaxed enough to do whatever was necessary to get The Duke . Whatever was necessary . <p> He had n't expected it , none of them had . Only twenty minutes earlier he 'd been walking through the aisles , his mood a mixture of condescension and nostalgia . You found all kinds here , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at five New Yen each , to hard core ( and hard surface ) wheeler-dealers , looking for a quick score on a case of 21st century Ki Fu 's or a half dozen " specially preserved " Dwight Gooden 's . A hobbyist 's tender compulsion expanded ( and perverted ) to unfeeling commercial carnivore . Conventions of this kind had spread across six terrestrial continents and three lunar colonies , and there was even talk that , next year , there 'd be one on Ceres . It seemed like any place you had ten thousand people , regardless of whether there was any external atmosphere , two hundred were in the business . <p> Of course , baseball was only one category . There were basketball players and football players and actors and politicians . Hell , if you were intellectual , there were even novelists and scientists  --  but somehow the sound of " I 'll trade you two Norman Mailers for a Stephen Hawking , " just did n't feel right to Curran . For him , as for so many others the tributes two centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gum and memorializing the ancient greats : Ty Cobb and Dizzy Dean , Joe D. , Willie , Oisk , Aaron , Clemente , Mickey  --  <p> And The Duke . <p> He could n't believe it when he heard it . He 'd just paused at a station manned by a thirtyish woman hawking " mint condition " Rip Repulski 's , when the announcement came over the PA . " There will be an auction in the green room beginning in ten minutes . Among the players available is the Brooklyn Dodgers ' Duke Snider , to be sold as a singleton . " <p> Curran had been lightheaded , the funk lasting even through the auction 's opening rounds . He 'd been searching for The Duke for years , and now , out of the blue , here it was within his grasp . He 'd emerged from his reverie only when the bidding had hit 40 thousand New Yen and the number of bidders had dropped to four . Quickly , Curran had upped the stakes , punching in 53 thousand New Yen and forcing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew one of the remaining players vaguely , a paunchy , sour faced man named Rabinall , whom he 'd briefly spoken to at a convention in Nuevo Miami in the early 2140 's . Rabinall had wanted to buy a Whitey Lockman from him , but Curran had demurred at the last moment , stubbornly refusing to come down a final notch in price . Speculator , he 'd thought . Bottom-liner . In-and-outer , with no feel for the game . Of course , it was quite irrational . The other bidder , a woman , was a mystery . <p> Curran wondered : Had either of them ever played the actual sport , as he had ? Were they holo fanatics , as he was , watching game after game , present and past , day after night , losing his wife , his kids , his job  --  until that became his job ? Had they paid a hundred extra New Yen for the old baseball stats to be installed in their neuroplants , so that they could tell you , as he could , George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ERA in 2089 ? <p> Probably not . . . and probably better off for it . <p> The bidding was about to resume . Why the hell did it have to be live and not over holo ? But , of course , that was the idea  --  smell your competition sweat . Feel his/her tension . Taste it in the air . <p> " I have a bid for 59K , " announced the crisp synthetic voice of the auctioneer . <p> Curran looked at his screen . It was Rabinall . Curran had a decision to make , a tactic to decide on , and it had to be done quickly . He had an absolute upper spending limit of 75K . He was a moderately wealthy man , but he 'd been investing heavily in his collection  --  all right , not investing , indulging  --  but the fact was he 'd reached the very farthest edge of his credit . And so it came down to a matter of game psychology . Did he go right to the precipice at once , demonstrating thereby to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . or did he methodically just top the other offers for as long as he could , hopefully projecting a kind of implacable persistence and saving what could be a significant amount of money ? <p> He punched in 75K . And waited . <p> " Going once at 75K , " said the auctioneer . A blue square appeared at the woman 's position on the screen . She 'd dropped out . <p> " Going twice . . . " said the auctioneer . <p> Curran could barely breathe . He had it , it was his , he 'd finally  --  <p> Inside Rabinall 's red square , a number came up : 80K . A nearly inaudible whimper escaped Curran 's lips . It was over . Finito . He punched in his blue square , inhaled , and dazedly stood up . " Sold for 80K , " he heard the auctioneer intone , from what sounded like a great distance . He was surprised to see the woman approaching . <p> " Too bad , " she said . She was a blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it always was ) if she 'd ever been reconstructed . <p> " Win some , lose some , " he noted stupidly . <p> " You know him ? " she asked , tilting her chin in the direction of Rabinall , who was collecting his boxed Duke from the machine . <p> " Not really , " said Curran . " He once tried to buy a Whitey Lockman from me , but that 's about it . " He paused . " You ? " <p> " Sold him a Monte Irvin last year at Sao Paulo . Were you at that one ? " <p> " I only go to eight a year . I missed Sao Paulo . " <p> " He made quite a splash there . Took home a Willie Mays , if I recall correctly . " <p> " Willie Mays ? " Something began to jell in Curran 's mind , a complex chain of neurons lost some inter-synaptic resistance . Whitey Lockman , Monte Irvin , Willie Mays . . . . He rubbed his eyes , and was not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You still want The Duke , " said the fleshy man , his tone flat and certain . <p> He held the precious container in his pudgy hands . <p> " Yes , " said Curran shakily . <p> " And you know what I 'm after . " <p> Curran inhaled . " You 're collecting . . . Giants . New York Giants of the nineteen-fifties . " <p> Rabinall lifted an eyebrow . Curran had misjudged him . Misjudged him entirely . There was passion here , and quite beyond the financial . <p> " Trade , " said Rabinall . <p> " You have n't found another Lockman , " ventured Curran , and he knew immediately he was correct . " So what is it , Whitey for the Duke ? " <p> " Do n't be absurd , " said Rabinall . " The two were n't remotely comparable players . Check the stats . Check the market . " He paused , pursed his lips . " I know you have a Sal Maglie . " <p> So that was it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Maglie , over his career , had been both a Giant and a Dodger . Curran considered , inhaled ( he hoped ) inaudibly . He took one more shot . " I give you Maglie and Lockman , you give me the Duke  --  and a player to be named later . Market worth 10K . " <p> " No player , " said Rabinall . " Straight-up trade . " <p> Curran waited , stalled just to see Rabinall sweat . Because he understood Rabinall fully now , understood him as well as he did himself . Finally , tight grin slowly widening , he said , " Deal . " <p> Later , when it had all been done , the exchanges made , the guarantees signed , Curran had gone for a walk , childishly and foolhardily still clutching the singleton container of the Duke . <p> He 'd done it , he finally had a team . Brooklyn Dodgers , circa 1952 . Complete at every position . Erskine on the mound ; Hodges , Robinson , Reese , and Cox in the infield ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Duke in the outfield . And he 'd bring them to term , too . No computer investing for him , no hoarding the seeds without tasting the fruit . No sir . He had n't bought all that equipment for nothing . The Artificial Womb alone had cost 40K ; the Nano-neural Educator , 32K ; the Growth Accelerator , a cool 75K ( including re-conditioning ) . <p> Once more , he fondled the battery-cooled container , with its cargo of precious cells . He wondered from where on the Duke 's lithe body they had come , whether they 'd been donated or stolen , scraped or shed , sold legally or black-marketed . No matter , he 'd have plenty of time to read the pedigrees , as he 'd done so often before . One of the pleasures of ownership . <p> Yes , these cells would be cloned , all right . They 'd develop , they 'd mature , and the Duke would play again . Glide effortlessly through the green grass in center field to make a graceful , leaping , time-frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right with that sweet , fluid swing  --  a ball going , going , gone for a home run . <p> Yes , the Duke would return to the game . They all did , and why not ? Sure , the Educator would pre-dispose them to accept the contracts he would offer  --  not that they would n't be eminently fair  --  but , more cogently ( was he a mystic ? ) , it was in their blood . To be a ballplayer . The best of the best . What else could they do ? <p> They 'd have a great time . He 'd take them on tour , his own team , and they 'd play everyone . The tragic 2032 Eagles , whose cells were all scraped from the site of the sub-orbital crash . The awful 1998 Florida Marlins , losers of 136 games in a single season . The 2129 Slashers , with the robot third baseman . All of them , every one . <p> Some day , thought Curran , they might even meet the 1950 's New York Giants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might conceivably end up pitching for each team . The thought made him smile . Now that would be a game . <p> <p> By Robert Grossbach <p> Robert Grossbach last appeared in F &SF; in April , 1985 , with his story " Rift . " He returns with the second baseball story of this issue , " A Feel for the Game . " Robert belongs to that most passionate group of all baseball fans , the Brooklyn Dodger fans . Like his team , he has moved from New York to Los Angeles . " I suppose my move to LA began to stimulate some strong feeling of nostalgia , " he writes , " and one day I simply felt an overwhelming compulsion to write this . I am usually a planner and a plodder but this one emerged , if you 'll pardon the analogy , like a cat coughs up a hairball . It was n't a bad feeling . " <p>
