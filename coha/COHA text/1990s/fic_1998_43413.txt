WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE <p> Jess , Henry Violet , and Benny Alden , four orphaned children , run away , thinking that their grandfather is coming to claim them . Although they have never seen him , they believe him to be a cruel man . <p> During a storm , they take shelter in an old railroad boxcar that they find stranded in the woods , and decide to live there . They furnish it with a few odds and ends that they find in a dump heap . Henry finds a job in a nearby town helping young Dr. McAllister and his mother , and returns each night to the boxcar home with food and other supplies . The doctor becomes very curious when Henry brings his little brother and two sisters along with him one day to help with the cherry picking . That night , Dr. McAllister is surprised to find an advertisement in the paper , offering a reward of $5 , 000 for information concerning four lost children . ' Whew ! " he exclaims , when he reads the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V <p> The Alden Steel Mills stood a little aside from the city of Greenfield , as if they were a little too good to associate with common factories . James Henry Alden sat in a huge leather chair in his private office . He was a man nearly sixty years of age whose dark brown hair was still untouched by gray . He had rather hard lines around his mouth , but softer ones around his eyes . Printed on the glass top of his door were these words in black and gold : <p> J. H. ALDEN-President Private <p> Once a year , J.H. Alden allowed himself a holiday . He loved watching healthy children run without their hats , jump , throw rings , swim and vault with long poles . And in company with three other extremely rich men , he arranged , once a year , a Field Day for the town of Intervale . The men attended it in person , and supplied all the money . Today was Field Day . <p> All through the spring and early summer months , boys were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field Day . And not only boys , but men old and young , and girls of all ages trained for it . Prizes were offered for tennis , baseball , rowing , swimming , running , and every imaginable type of athletic feat . But usually the interest of the day centered on a free-for-all race of one mile , which everyone enjoyed , and a great many people entered . Twenty-five dollars and a silver trophy cup were offered to the winner of this race . Sometimes the cup was won by a middle-aged man , sometimes by a girl , and sometimes by a trained athlete . Mr. Alden smiled as he closed his desk , ordered his limousine , and went out and locked the door of his office . The mill had been closed down for the day . Everyone attended Field Day . <p> Henry was washing the concrete drives at Dr. McAllister 's at this moment . He heard the doctor call to him from the road , so he promptly turned off the hose and ran out to see what was wanted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stopping his engine . " You ought to go to see the stunts at the athletic meet . It 's Field Day . " <p> Henry did not wish to delay the doctor , so he hopped in . <p> " Ca n't go myself , " said Dr. McAllister . " I 'll just drop you off at the grounds . There 's no charge for admittance . You just watch all the events and report to me who wins . <p> Henry tried to explain to his friend that he ought to be working , but there was actually no time . And when he found himself seated on the bleachers and the stunts began , he forgot everything in the world except the exciting events before his eyes . <p> Henry had no pencil , but he had an excellent memory . He repeated over and over the name of each winner as it appeared on the huge signboard . <p> It was nearly eleven o'clock when the free-forall running race was announced . <p> " What do you mean-free-for-all ? " asked Henry of a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody , " explained the boy curiously . " Did n't you ever see one ? Did n't you see the one last year ? " <p> " No , " said Henry . <p> The boy laughed . " That was a funny one , " he said . " There was a college runner in it , and a couple of fat men , and some girls-lots of people . And the little boy over there won it . You just ought to have seen that boy run ! He went so fast you could n't see his legs . Beat the college runner , you know . " <p> Henry gazed at the winner of last year 's race . He was smaller than Henry , but apparently older . In a few minutes Henry had quietly left his place on the bleachers . When the boy turned to speak to him again , Henry was gone . <p> A man stepped up to him quickly . <p> " Want to enter ? " he asked . " No time to waste . " <p> " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of white shoes and some blue shorts . He liked the look of Henry 's face as he paused to ask in an undertone , " Where did you train ? " <p> " Never trained , " replied Henry . <p> " I suppose you know these fellows have been training all the year ? " observed the man . " You do n't expect to win ? " <p> " Oh , no ! " replied Henry , apparently shocked at the idea . " But it 's lots of fun to run , you know . " He was dressed and ready by this time . How light he felt ! He felt as if he could almost fly . Presently , the contestants were all marshaled out to the running track . Henry was Number 4 . <p> Now , Henry had never been trained to run , but all his life he had loved running so much that he preferred to run rather than walk . In school he had always tried to beat the boys on bicycles . He also possessed an unusual quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought to himself , and it 's the second half-mile that counts . Its fun to run , anyhow . <p> It was fun , certainly . He felt as if his limbs were strung together on springs . He ran easily , without effort , each step bounding into the next like an elastic band . <p> After . a few minutes of this , Henry had a new thought . Now you 've seen how easy you can run , let 's see how fast you can run ! <p> And then not only Henry himself , but the enormous crowd as well , began to see how fast he could run . Slowly he gained on the fellow ahead of him , and passed him . With the next fellow as a goal , he gradually crept alongside , and passed him with a spurt . The crowd shouted itself hoarse . The field all along the course was crowded with people . Henry could hear them cheering for Number 4 , as he pounded by . <p> Six runners remained ahead of him . Here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair between two runners , but a gradual victory between the best runner and overpowering odds . Henry could see the finish-flag now in the distance . He began to spurt . He passed Numbers 14 and 3 . He passed 25 , 6 , and 1 almost in a bunch . Number 16 remained ahead . Then Henry began to think of winning . How much the twenty-five-dollar prize would mean to Jess and the rest ! Number 16 must be passed . <p> " I 'm going to win this race ! " he said quietly . " I 'll bet you I am ! " The idea lent him speed . " Number 4 ! Number 4 ! " yelled the crowd . Henry did not know that the fellow ahead had been ahead all the way , and just because heHenry-had slowly gained over everyone , the crowd loved him best . <p> Henry waited until he could have touched the other runner . He was within three yards of the wire . He bent double , and put all his energy into the last elastic bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire . <p> Then the crowd went wild . It scrambled over and under the fence , cheering and blowing its horns . Henry felt himself lifted on many shoulders and carried , panting , up to the reviewing stand . He bowed , laughing at the sea of faces , and took the silver cup in a sort of dream . It was a wonder he did not lose the envelope containing the prize money , for he hardly realized what it was when he took it . <p> Then someone asked , " What 's your name , boy ? " <p> That called him back to earth . He had to think quickly while catching his breath . <p> " Henry James , " he replied . This was perfectly true , as far as it went . In a moment the enormous signboard flashed out the name : <p> HENRY JAMES , No. 4 , AGE 13 <p> WINNER OF FREE-FOR-ALL <p> Meanwhile , the man from the dressing room was busy locating Mr. Alden of the Alden Mills . He knew that was exactly the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , sir , " he said smiling . " I says to him , You do n't expect to win , of course . ' And he says to me , Oh , no , but it 's lots of fun to run , you know . ' " <p> " Thank you , sir , " returned Mr. Alden . " That 's a good story . Bring the youngster over here , if you do n't mind . " <p> When Henry appeared , a trifle shaken out of his daze and anxious only to get away , Mr. Alden stretched out his hand . " I like your spirit , my boy , " he said . " I like your running , too . But it 's your spirit that I like best . Do n't ever lose it . " <p> " Thank you , " said Henry , shaking hands . And there was only one person in the whole crowd who knew who was shaking hands with whom . Certainly James Henry and Henry James did not know . <p> With twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he edged through the crowd to the gate . <p> " That 's the boy , " he heard many a person say when he was forced to hold his silver cup out of harm 's way . <p> When Dr. McAllister drove into his yard , he found a boy washing the concrete drives as calmly as if nothing had happened . He chuckled quietly , for he had stopped at the fairgrounds for a few minutes himself , and held a little conversation with the scorekeeper . When Henry faithfully repeated the list of winners , however , he did n't mention that he himself had won the free-for-all . <p> " What are you going to do with the prize ? " queried Dr. McAllister . <p> " Put it in the savings bank , I guess , " replied Henry . <p> " Have you an account ? " asked his friend . <p> " No , but Jess says it 's high time we started one . <p> " Good for Jess , " said the doctor absently . " I remember an old uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank and forgot all about it . He left it in there till he died , and it came to me . It amounted to sixteen hundred dollars . " <p> " Whew ! " said Henry . <p> " He left it alone for over forty years , you see , " explained Dr. McAllister . <p> When Henry arrived at his little home in the woods with the twenty-five dollars ( for he never thought of putting it in the bank before Jess saw it ) , he found a delicious lunch waiting for him . Jess had boiled the little vegetables in clear water , and the moment they were done , she drained off the water in a remarkable drainer and heaped them on the biggest dish with melted butter on top . <p> His family almost forgot to eat while Henry recounted the details of the exciting race . And when he showed them the silver cup and the money , they actually did stop eating , hungry as they were . <p> " I said my name was Henry James , " repeated Henry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Jess . " It 's clever , too . You can use that name for your bank book . " <p> " So I can ! " said Henry , delighted . " I 'll put it in the bank this very afternoon . And by the way , I brought something for dinner tonight . " <p> Jess looked in the bag . There were a dozen smooth , brown potatoes . <p> " I know how to cook those , " said Jess , nodding her head wisely . " You just wait ! " <p> " Ca n't wait , hardly , " Henry called back as he went to work . <p> When he had gone , Benny frolicked around noisily with the dog . <p> " Benny , " Jess exclaimed suddenly , as she hung her dish towels up to dry , " it 's high time you learned to read . " <p> " No school now , " said Benny hopefully . <p> " No , but I can teach you . If I only had a primer ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have saved all the wrapping paper from the bundles , you know . " <p> Jess stared off into space , as she always did when she had a bright idea . <p> " Violet , " she cried at last , " remember those wood chips ? We could whittle out letters like type-make each letter backwards , you know . " <p> " And stamp them on paper ! " finished Violet , her cheeks flushed with eagerness . <p> " There would be only twenty-six in all . It would n't be awfully hard , " said Jess . " We would n't bother with capitals . " <p> " What could we use for ink ? " Violet wondered , wrinkling her forehead . <p> " Blackberry juice ! " cried Jess . The two girls clapped their hands . " Wo n't Henry be surprised when he finds that Benny can read ? " <p> Now from this conversation Benny gathered that this type-business would take his sisters quite a while to prepare . So he was not much worried about his part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips very cheerfully and watched his teachers with interest as they dug carefully around the letters with the two knives . <p> " We 'll teach him two words to begin with , " said Jess . " Then we wo n't have to make the whole alphabet at once . Let 's begin to teach him the word see . ' " <p> " That 's easy , " agreed Violet . " And then we wo n't have to make but two letters , S and E. " <p> " And the other word will be me , " cried Jess . " So that 's only three pieces of type in all , Violet . " <p> Jess cut the wiggly S , because she had the better knife , while Violet struggled with the E. Then Jess cut a wonderful M , while Violet sewed the primer down the back and gathered a cupful of blackberries . As she sat by , crushing the juice from the berries with a stick , Jess planned how to make the ink pad . <p> " We 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid , " she said at last . <p> But finally they were obliged to cut off only the uneven bits of cloth which hung around the edges . These they used for stuffing for the pad , and covered them with a pocket which Violet carefully ripped from her apron . When this was sewed firmly into place and put into a small saucer , Jess poured on the purple juice . Even Benny crawled over on his hands and knees to watch her stamp the first S. It came out beautifully on the first page of the primer , purple and clean-cut . The E was almost as good , and as for the M , Jess 's hand shook with pure pride as she stamped it evenly on the page . At last the two words were completed . In fact , they were done long before Benny had the slightest idea that his sisters were ready for him . <p> He came willingly enough for his first lesson , but he could not tell the two words apart . <p> " Do n't you see , Benny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wiggly S says see ? " But Benny did not " see . " <p> " I 'll tell you , Jess , " said Violet at last . " Let 's print each word again on a separate card . That 's the way they do at school . And then let him point to see . <p> The girls did this , using squares of stiff brown paper . Then they called Benny . Very carefully , Jess explained again which word said see , hissing like a huge snake to show him how the S sounded . Then she mixed the cards , and said encouragingly , " Now , Benny point to s-s-s-ee . " <p> Benny did not move . He sat with his finger in his mouth . <p> But the children were nearly petrified with astonishment to see Watch cock his head on one side and gravely put his paw on the center of the word ! Now , this was only an accident . Watch did not really know one of the words from the other . But Benny thought he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of him ? Not Benny ! In less time than it takes to tell it , Benny had learned both words perfectly . <p> " Good old Watch , " said Jess . <p> " It is n't really hard , " said Benny . " Is it , Watch ? " <p> During all this experiment , Jess had not forgotten her dinner . When you are living outdoors all the time , you do not forget things like that . In fact both girls had learned to tell the time very accurately by the sun . <p> Jess started up a beautiful little fire of pine cones . As they turned into red-hot ashes and began to topple over one by one into the glowing pile , Jess laughed delightedly . She had already scrubbed the smooth potatoes and dried them carefully . She now poked them one by one into the glowing ashes with a stick from a birch tree . Whenever a potato lit up dangerously , she gave it a poke into a new position And when Henry found her , she was just rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Burned ' em up ? " queried Henry . <p> " Burned , nothing ! " cried Jess energetically . " You just wait ! " <p> " Ca n't wait , hardly , " replied Henry smiling . <p> " You said that a long time ago , " said Benny . <p> " Well , is n't it true ? " demanded Henry , rolling his brother over on the pine needles . <p> " Come ! " said Violet breathlessly , forgetting to ring the dinner bell . <p> " Hold them with leaves , " directed Jess , " because they 're terribly hot . Knock them on the side and scoop them out with a spoon and put butter on top . " <p> The children did as the little cook requested , sprinkled on a little salt from the salt shaker , and took a taste . <p> " Ah ! " said Henry . <p> " It 's good , " said Benny blissfully . It was about the most successful meal of all , in fact . When the children in later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the baked potatoes roasted in the ashes of the pine cones . Henry said it was because Jess nearly burned them up . Jess herself said maybe it was the remarkable salt shaker which had to stand on its head because there was no floor to it . <p> After supper , the children still were not too sleepy to show Henry the new primer , and allow Benny to display his first reading lesson . Henry , greatly taken with the idea , sat up until it was almost dark , chipping out the remaining letters of the alphabet . ( to be continued in the next issue ) <p>
