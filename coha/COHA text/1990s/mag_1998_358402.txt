Until there 's a body count , until there 's a tearful post-rehab Barbara Walters interview , until there 's vehicular wreckage in a Parisian tunnel , most of us have limited tolerance for celebrities who gripe about the supposed burdens of fame . That Madonna , of all people , of all celebrities , should make the rejection of stardom and materialism the major theme of her new CD , Ray of Light ( Maverick/Warner Bros. ) should rightly make thinking people pause . Did n't she , from the very start , insist that we love her , demand that we worship her golden calves , her exposed iconic midriff , her conical Jean-Paul Gaultier bras ? Did n't she , Marilyn-like , pursue the starring role in Evita , and Hollywood thespianhood in general , with .45-cal. ambition ? Was n't that she on the back cover of her 1992 shock-pop album Erotica sucking on some stranger 's foot ? Is n't she the original Material Girl ? <P> But this is Madonna ' 98 , at the close of an exhausted millennium , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only be used ironically , when everything has come full circle and the Spice Girls can look and sound the way Madonna did 15 years ago and still be hailed as fresh and fun . So you move on . Madonna is the head of the record label  --  the aptly named Maverick  --  that released last year 's band of the moment , the electronica-charged act the Prodigy ( Maverick is part of Time Warner , the company that owns TIME ) . It makes sense , then , that Ray of Light draws on electronica for sonic inspiration . Madonna ' 98 is also a new mother ( her daughter Lourdes is 17 months old ) ; she has also been studying the Cabala ( a form of Jewish mysticism ) , practicing yoga and learning Sanskrit . <P> All this is fuel for her new fire . Now the spotlight feels to her like an inferno , and her popularity looks like an abyss . " I traded fame for love , " she laments on the CD 's opening song , the gently cascading Drowned World/Substitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she confesses " Looking at my life/It 's very clear to me/I lived so selfishly . " <P> Madonna , in the lyrics on this album , finds solace in family and philosophy . " You breathe/New life/Into my broken heart , " she sings on Little Star , a swirling lullaby-like song about her daughter . On another track , the chanting Shanti/Ashtangi , Madonna sings in Sanskrit  --  something that , not too many years ago , would have been about as unthinkable as Hanson today singing in Serbo-Croatian . In translation , a line of Shanti/Ashtangi reads " I worship the gurus ' lotus feet/ Awakening the happiness of the self revealed . " Madonna in only six years has gone from sucking on feet to using them as catalysts for spiritual revelation . <P> The album has a liquid feel ; melodies and rhythms wash and flow into each other . This , however , is not a current of water but of electricity : the album is propelled by synthesized sounds , electronic drumbeats and artificial noises . Madonna is clearly borrowing heavily from cutting-edge electronica-tinged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Orbit , Madonna 's collaborator on the CD ( he co-wrote and co-produced nearly every track ) says she might release a second CD featuring the songs that were too experimental to make the album . " It would be like the play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead , " says Orbit , who has also worked with Seal and Massive Attack . " You 'd see the original album from a slightly different angle .
