Kathe writes , " Sylvia Plath is a great favorite of mine:genius and ferocity , a pure velocity of attack ; what might she have done with those years since her death ? The famous quote from A. Alvarez  --  ' Poetry of this order is a murderous art '  --  dovetails with Robert Lowell 's summation , in the introduction to Ariel : ' Her art 's immortality is life 's disintegration . ' But I prefer Nabokov in Pale Fire : ' We who burrow in filth every day may be forgiven perhaps the one sin that ends all sin . ' " <p> The maisonette was cold , had been cold , it was cold all over London in this winter where every pain was shaped and clear and made of purest ice . Hands on the table , hands on her head , flat hands with palms as still and cold as sarcophagus marble , my Christ was she going to cry again ? No . No . She would not cry for him or anyone , bastard , bastard and her , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in Spain , she hoped they were both dead . The children were asleep ; she had just checked them , dim peaceful faces and they did not know about their father , did not know they were better off without him , better off if he were dead . <p> Ach , du . <p> Like voices in her head , auditory hallucinations . She did not have them ; shock treatments , yes , but she did not have voices in her head or if she did it was poetry 's own voice , not the muse but the bloody angel that flies behind it , no hands at all but talons springing bright as broken bones from the seamless flesh of its arms . She had written three poems this week , might write three more ; or thirty ; they would make her name , she had written that to her mother . Long letters to her mother like blood trailing on the floor , blood on the ice freezing like jelly and she with a stick to pick it up , messing it back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father ?  --  pushing the stick from her hands , her cold hands empty again and the stick snapped in half like a broken bone , its lines like runes , instructions in dark angles so subtle and opaque that no one could fail to understand . Voodoo dolls , magic mirrors broken in slivers and slats like the gates of hell , the gates of heaven , all of it power and glory but who had the power , really , and the glory that comes with it like stink comes with shit , who ? Not her , there at the table , not her with her head in her hands . <p> It was two thirty in the morning , temperatures falling cold as old stones , old black stones and she had been trying to write , write a new poem about old black stones . The rooms were clean and quiet ; toys and clothes in order , kitchen clean , three cups and one tray of uncooked muffins lying like sacrifice on the minuscule counter . She thought she heard her neighbor stir , downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole pink body one susurrating whisper ; thought she heard her daughter sigh in the midst of a dream . Little girls are born with dreams , cuffed needs inside like little eggs waiting to drop , fall fat like fruit , like the seeds of babies ; but they do n't need them . What they need are weapons , armies ; they need to be armies , they need to be able to fight . Little boys are taught how to do that ; it is a knowledge assumed as necessary as knowing how to point your penis when you piss . team how to fight , hit , throw stones , black stones like pennies on her eyes , she would lie m a grave like a trundle bed and who would care then ? Not him . <p> Her hand on the paper like automatic writing , like using the planchette , its little needle the pointy nose of some feared pet , grave weasel , ferreting out the damned : you , and you . And you , especially ; you did n't think we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write since midnight , since two ; she had talked to her neighbor , his face swarming out of the light belowstairs like some bewildered god , a modern god left without magic in the normal miracle of electricity . She had wanted to borrow some stamps ; he had asked her if she was all right : " You are n't really well , are you ? " Are you ? Did he see somewhere in her face the shadow of the stones , did he see black spots left behind , little cancerous spores like pits left burned by feet made of acid , what did he see ? There on the paper before her , the word , spore ; or was it spoor ? How cold it was in here , it was hard to see the paper , harder still to hold the pen . I 'm fine , she had said ; do n't call the doctor , I 'm fine . <p> So many doctors ; this new one was not bad , he seemed to understand , so many pressures on her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the paralytic cold . Of her other difficulties , of her husband and that woman , he was sympathetic , he was not unkind . Again and again he reminded her of her children , of her friends , her mother and brother , the people who cared : like an army of love , massed around her to give her strength . She needed strength , now more than ever ; given at times to anger but at heart she was not a fighter ; better , perhaps , if she had been . Little girl dreams ; and flung stones ; it was cold enough to freeze stones in here , sacks of ice split open to show like a pearl the motionless heart . <p> She had always hated the cold . Little girl days , watching the ocean ; the spray like the sparkle of weapons , tips of arrows shining in the sun . Her dead father underground , no light for him . She felt her hand move across the paper , felt the pen as if it were another finger , sweet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was what allowed her to write . Did everyone have something like that , some rich handicap that in paradox freed its host ? Her husband , what was his deformity ? A penis that hissed like a snake , a fat red snake with one hot eye ? and hers , what was hers , patent-leather bitch with her heavy scent and her voice like a man 's , what did she have that made her special ? Besides him ? <p> Her hand distracting moving again and she read the line aloud to herself like honey on the tongue : read it again but softly , she did not want to wake the children , wake her neighbor below stairs ; he needed his sleep . She needed sleep , too , but she needed this more . <p> Black stones , the poem told her , were in essence secret monuments to suffering scattered across the unforgiving earth as grave markers for sadnesses and sorrows yet to be : and the job of each to find and gather the stones belonging to him , to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monument to the human capacity for self-inflicted pain . And what  --  pen in hand and in the dark , what is in your pike , what lies in half-completion waiting agonies to be ? <p> The baby made a noise ; a car passed outside . Her bladder ached lightly and she stood for a moment , one hand on the chair 's back , the other on her own , pressing where the pain seemed to be . So many pains below the surface ; so many spots she could not reach . On the chair , draped like mockery the party dress , blue bodice glittering false and sweet ; she looked away ; she looked down . Sitting in the ear , hands in her lap she had been sitting in the car and suddenly there was her neighbor , knocking on the window , was she all right ? People were always asking her that ; was she ? The blue bodice tight as a secret against her heart and she had told him she was fine , then too , just fine ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice long holiday , a long rest . She might have said , I 'm going off to war ; for war you need weapons ; perhaps that was in the poem , too , hidden like a snake in the pile of stones . So many stones . <p> Here a stone for her father 's death , dark sugary light surrounding it like infrared ; red-eyed and eight years old , she had composed a document for her mother to sign : I WILL NEVER MARRY AGAIN . What a big stone that was , yet unheavy ; without trying she could lift it with the bent tip of her nail . Beside it another stone for her mother , a small one shaped like a kidney ; and a smaller stone still , for a baby unborn . <p> More  --  so many ?  --  for men , most so small her own sad contempt might have goaded her into overlooking them had she not stumbled , stubbed her toes ( like her father , in fact , before her , and what were those red marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding like a job begun in the vertiginous moment that these stones too were hers to carry and to keep . In her hands they were not so heavy , though walking in the cold made them more so , the long cold shadow born of the darkness of the biggest stone of all . That one she deliberately sidestepped , big and black as a monument itself , heavy as the weight of his body in the dark ; it was , she thought ( and said ; did she say it aloud ? ) no longer hers to carry : let her carry it instead , the covetous bitch , let her bear the burden now . <p> Other stones  --  the New Yorker disappointments , the O'Connor class , all of it now as if seen from a painless distance , yet the edges of each stone still shone with a particular and vindictive clarity , as if they had been freshly sharpened not an hour before . Newer rejections ( as he , the bastard , was basking in light ) made their own pile , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of them , a waterless strand : her poverty , her loneliness , even the cold made a carpet of black all the way to the horizon , an endlessness like the tears of the dying of those who die alone . Despairing of bearing them , she let fall the ones in her arms ; there were too many , it was all too much , an army equipped with a pile this big fierce black edges like excised teeth and the world itself one howling mouth , velvet-dark like the jaws of a guard dog , slick and scentless , dangerously cold . <p> You could burn to death , in cold like that . <p> The baby began whimpering in earnest ; she rose , back twingeing , to check on him , moving quiet and surely as upon the surface of a lake , frozen water slick and hard as promises , depthless as the edge of the knife , the smile in the darkness , the heavy scent of gas . <p> Now it was three thirty , quarter to four ; she had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end the poem held her , kept her cramping hands busy . What if  --  head to one side , sinusitis ache but she was too busy , now , to notice  --  what if there were a way to make of the stones more than monuments , what if instead they were weapons , but weapons to be used on others rather than self ? And take the step , not a long step at all , a logical motion to make of the stones themselves an army , who was it sowed the dragon 's teeth ? She did not remember , English major , Smith girl , she should remember . Perhaps the poem itself was a stone . Perhaps it was her stone , perhaps she ought to throw it at someone , good and hard , no secret about that and she almost laughed ; or did she ? Did the baby stir ? Sweet baby , sometimes it was so hard to look after him , to look after them both ; fatherless woman with her fatherless children , alone on a plain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them your flesh on which to sleep , to make a carpet keeping them from the cold ; she loved her children ; it was so hard . <p> The pen in her hand moved a moment ; she ignored it ; stubbornly it moved again and the stones shifted , now they were a path , built deliberate and strong for the wheels of iron , the chariots of the queen : warrior queen , and what a grand tradition that was , bare breasts and hair like eagles , their very gaze enough to split a rock , split the boulders in their paths and beside them the men , running panting , trying to keep up . They knew , those women  --  with a smile , there was no denying it , a smile there in the sober light  --  they knew all about war , about tactics and plans , about ways to thwart the enemy even when he lies beside you ( and how he lies ) ; they were not fooled , they were not afraid . It was crippling fear , debilitating as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stone on your heart . A warrior queen , what would she do ? smash the stone , or the heart it breaks ? Smash your head open like a stone , and let the cold brain bleed out like jelly through the cracks . <p> Tired , now , of thinking , the brief exhilaration making her instead ready to weep , like the false gaiety of alcohol , giddy champagne nerves , when had she last drunk champagne ? When had she last had reason ? To friends she had determinedly crowed in false bravado of her newfound escape from the suffocation of pure domesticity , she was free now , she was doing what she had always wanted to do ; her work was tremendous in its new liberation , well that was true , these poems were the best of her life . Her life : what else ? Again her thoughts circling , thinking of him , then of her baby boy , a little tyrant too to one woman , one day ?  --  or more , her mouth turning down again , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered so long she knew how it was done , without fanfare , without tears if possible , certainly without the long distorting grimace ; a pale frown would do as well , as well . What about him , this boy-baby , her son ? and what about her daughter , plump toddler 's cheek and trusting eyes , innocent of the need for weapons , she did not even guess there was a war . How to look at such innocence , both of them , neither of them knew a thing about men and women , love and envy , the way it feels when the black millstone grinds against your heart , the way it feels to breathe blood and call it air . How to keep them safe , how to save herself ? how to understand , these stones so real she could feel them , feel them in her hands like Medusa 's breasts , big , contemptuous and cold . She put her hands to her face and did not cry , but felt somewhere  --  in the gripe of her belly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tears , rolling , turning like acid in a vase , the shivering sea undrowned by all the stones in all the world . <p> And how could she change that ? <p> Finished , now , with the poem ; done thinking anti her hands loose and empty on the table , pen down and paper folded ; she had left a note downstairs , pinned to the hallway pram . No solution but an elegance of decision , there was calm in a decision , a space delicious as the pure moments post-fever where the scorched body can relax for a heartbeat 's minute before taking up the sterner work of health . She knew what needed to be done , as surely as any warrior queen , sure as the wheels of chariots grinding sparks from the stones below . <p> Turning on the gas , hand on the dial like the hand of the angel who opens at last the book of life , the silent seeping odor and she bent , half-kneeling , to the door , one toweled hand to steady her motion  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so tired  --  the other past her bending head , bending as if in benediction to slip into growing warmth the metal tray of muffins , breakfast for the children , for herself : hard little pumpernickel muffins like black stones to be heated till they were soft ; and warm ; and ready . She filled the three mugs with milk ; already it was light outside . <p> <p> By Kathe Koja <p> Kathe Koja has one of the most distinctive voices in the science fiction field .
