When the diplomatic equivalent of a bar fight threatened to break out last week in the United Nations Security Council , Bill Clinton 's most outspoken foreign-policy official unblinkingly held her own . The ruckus was touched off by Saddam Hussein 's chief emissary , Tariq Aziz , who accused the U.S. of ignoring Iraq 's good behavior and maliciously refusing to lift an economic embargo against Baghdad . Since less than a fortnight earlier Baghdad had menaced Kuwait with more than 80,000 troops , Aziz 's remark was disingenuous , if not absurd . The task of pointing this out fell to Madeleine Albright , the American ambassador to the U.N . " Words are cheap , " she bluntly declared . " Actions are the coin of the realm . " <P> That 's the kind of flinty performance that makes Albright the steadiest and clearest voice on the Clinton foreign-affairs team . Her willingness to wield the big stick whenever the President needs to make a point , in contrast with the painful hedging often employed by Secretary of State Warren Christopher , has put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates for the Secretary 's job if he is pushed into retirement after the midterm elections . " She is hot around here , " says an Administration official . " A star , " says another . " A crown jewel , " chimes a third . <P> In the process of earning those plaudits , Albright has transformed the job of U.N . ambassador from passive messenger to power player . In addition to explaining U.S. foreign policy , she now helps plot its direction . In an Administration initially wary of foreign entanglements , it was she who led calls for American involvement to prevent an exodus of Rwandan refugees into Zaire . Before that , she argued for a heightened U.S. role in Bosnia . <P> The daughter of a Czech diplomat who thundered against totalitarianism , Albright is most effective when taking the offensive . Three weeks ago , she referred to another speech by Aziz as " one of the most ridiculous delivered at the U.N . by Iraq . " And in July , she reduced the U.S. message to Haiti 's illegal military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soon , or you can depart involuntarily and soon . " But behind each appearance of a freewheeling attack lies careful prep work . She assiduously maintains her Washington power base , shuttling from New York City as many as five times a week , and seldom lets fly a rhetorical cannonade without first getting an O.K. from the White House . <P> Some detractors , however , view her as an apparatchik dutifully carrying out Clinton 's policy . Others carp at her penchant for television  --  the President has personally ordered her to appear as often as possible  --  suggesting it reflects a superficial approach to foreign-policy issues . ( " Ambassador Halfbright " is whispered by several adversaries in U.N . corridors . ) Hypersensitive U.N . diplomats also resent her absence from the U.N . party circuit , but she pleads too little time " to go schmoozing around the halls . " " The people I work with appreciate the fact that I 'm plugged into Washington , " she says . " I 'm in the inner circle . I 'm involved in everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
