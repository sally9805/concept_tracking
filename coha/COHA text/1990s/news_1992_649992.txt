Every time I went out to the car , I 'd slide myself in and pull that pack of smokes from the slot in the dash . Without looking at it , staring into the afternoon haze , I 'd run my fingertip back and forth over the unopened plastic tab and breathe . Thinking , but not really thinking . Breathing , but not thinking at all . Every break , every company-granted fifteen-minute block , I 'd go sit out in the lousy heat and play with the cellophane wrapper on a cigarette box as I sat sweating in the passenger seat of my not-so-old American sedan . <br> The doors would be open , there in my numbered spot between the video and audio production buildings , with the stereo on but not loud enough to hear . No breeze to move the smoky cloud over the satellite dishes behind their padlocked-fence enclosure . Signals shooting up and shooting down : weather radar , classic rock , and auto races . Wavelengths encoded with infomercials and kung fu ; pornography and cooking shows . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They go right past . Alien civilizations will see them , and know us through storm warnings , kung fu movies , and porn . <br> I had not smoked a butt in nearly four years , having quit soon after Elise and I were engaged . I bought the pack the day she told me she had spoken to a divorce lawyer , and it had stayed in my car ever since . I 'd never moved it , except for the times I went out to sit and not think , holding the box in my hand  --  they were Camel Filters , even  --  and I 'd play with the wrapper and say to myself : how bad would it be to have just one ? <br> Finally , there in my car with my shirt sticking to my skin , I thought , Well fuck it , it 's done , she 's moving out today , I 'm having a goddamn smoke finally . The moment I 'd started to pull the golden tab with some sort of conviction , my cell phone buzzed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from where I had placed it above the stereo . <br> " Andy . " A deep voice ; just enough gravel , just enough weight . Made for TV and radio . <br> " Mr. Nelson , you have saved me from smoking my first cigarette in a long time . " <br> " I never understood why you quit . " <br> " You know why I quit . " <br> " That was your first sign of weakness , Andy . You gave in . That 's why you 're where you are today . " <br> I threw the pack into the center console . " Are you trying to cheer me up somehow ? If so , it 's not working . " <br> " I know how you feel . I do . My first divorce was hard . So hard . They 're all bullshit . But trust me , they get a lot easier . " <br> " Jesus , maybe . . . maybe I 'd like to not make this a habit ? " <br> " Ha ! " Mr. Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anything better in radio land today ? " <br> " Today , radio land is going pretty well . I think . We never know how the corporate masters are feeling . An e-mail got forwarded around this morning about cuts in the news department now that the merger is on . Remote offices are worried , but I have a feeling it 's only a rumor . " I tried to sound like I was n't concerned . <br> " You 're safe , Andy . Everyone needs the weather . You 're good ! You 've got that good presence . " <br> " I suppose . " <br> " But you really should get back into television . You were made for television . " <br> " I 'm pretty happy where I am now . " <br> " Really . " He coughed again . " Well , if you end up feeling not so happy , I might happen to know about an opening at the Omaha affiliate  --  " <br> " You mentioned . Things are fine in radio land . " <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Lots of tornadoes in Omaha , Andy . Cyclones ! I know you love those tornadoes . " <br> " Things are good for me here , Mr. Nelson . I mean it . " <br> " And easy , I 'm sure . Okay , you go get the headphones back on and put another no-chance-of-precip forecast in the can . But if you feel like getting back in front of a camera  --  " <br> " I 'll call you . " <br> " Call me anyway . And hang in there . I know it 's hard . I know how you feel . I know how you felt about Elise . " <br> " Thank you , Mr. Nelson . " <br> And that was that . I pushed the sunshade back against the windshield and locked up the car . Mr. Nelson  --  my old coach , mentor , and friend  --  called almost daily to check in . He knew things were rough . And he did a pretty good job of keeping my spirits up , even if it meant me hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day . <br> The air-conditioned blast as I reentered the audio building made my skin go tight with goose bumps . Our weather and news outpost was on the second floor , and I skipped riding the elevator for a jog up the stairway in a pathetic effort to get some sort of exercise . That daily trot was my only sort of exercise back then , and even if it did nothing for my overall fitness , at least I could fool myself and the beer-fed sheath of fat entrenched around my middle into believing I was submitting myself to some kind of regular physical activity . <br> If a wheezing run up the stairs to my studio got me feeling just a little bit better , the sight of my obese engineer , Vikas , usually helped me a lot . At least my physical state had not fallen that low . Not yet , anyway . Vikas sat behind the glass wall , slouched down in his rolling chair before his grand engineering board , a corporate polo shirt with a dark wet stain from his diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer . Maybe a little too young , and maybe a little too earnest . I loved the guy , though , shirt stain and all . After hours , in a total violation of company policy , he used the studio to record his hip-hop masterwork , voicing the angst of the Indian diaspora under the alias of DJ Fatty Vik . Vikas was born in Pasadena . <br> " Things better , Chief-o ? " he asked over the monitor , stifling a belch with his fist to his mouth . That was what he called me , Chief-o , like something out of a Rushdie novel . <br> " Nothing 's better , Vik . " <br> " It 'll get better . " <br> " That 's a . . . how old are you , Vikas ? " <br> " Twenty-four . You know that . And why ? Are n't you forty ? " <br> " Christ . Vik . Stop it . I 'm only ten years older than you . " I looked at him through the glass and held up both hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Only ten . " He was joking , but man . That hurt . I took my place in my chair and untangled my headphones . " Not forty yet . But I am starting to think nothing gets better after thirty . " <br> Vikas furrowed his brow , like he was afraid for a moment that it could really be true . The fear must have passed , because he rolled himself up to his controls and applied his chubby fingers to the knobs and sliders there . " Let 's hit the Central Valley bump again , Chief-o . " <br> I found my notes on my keyboard and pulled the microphone down and adjusted the pop screen . " There 's a twenty percent chance  --  " <br> " Come on , Andy , your levels are shit . Up . " <br> I repositioned the mic and closed my eyes . " Twenty , twenty , twenty . " <br> " Yeah . There you are . That 's it . " <br> I pressed on the sides of my headphones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance of some much-needed rain-shower activity in the Central Valley . Fresno , Selma , and other towns along the ninety-nine corridor can look for gusty winds as those scattered cloudbursts move through in the afternoon . San Diego County , you 're looking to continue that record of five hundred and eighty days without measurable precipitation , with no end to the extraordinary drought cycle in sight as high pressure once again becomes entrenched over the Pacific . From your Constellation Satellite Radio West Coast weather headquarters , I 'm Andy Dunne . " <br> " That 's it , " Vikas said . <br> " You sure ? " <br> " That was fine . I know you 've got . . . you want to just get going ? " <br> " Let me do those drive-time bumps . " <br> " I 'll get drive time . " Vikas almost looked embarrassed when he said it . " And I 'll do the uploads . " He saw me furrow my brow through the glass . " Corporate 's all gone home , dude . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " Thanks , Vik . " <br> " Go take care of your stuff . " <br> I shuffled my notes together and gathered up my things , and Vikas swatted at my arm as I walked past . To the right , the way I 'd normally go , the way I needed to go , was the stairway down to my car . To the left , two doors over in a double-size studio , were the Dubs , the Masters of Kung Fu and Asian Cookery , the artists more formally known as the Asia Pacific Voice Talent Studio , LLC . I could have gone ; could have seen what action flick or humiliating game show Lam and Billy and the rest of their genial and bilingual crew were cranking out that day . I could have checked if they 'd needed me for a crowd scene , or maybe a shout as a villain fell from a balcony . I could have , as more often was the case , gone to pick up takeout and beer for the troops on their forty-fifth , sixtieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Hillary . Hill , the voice of the Heroine , the voice of the Demure . The voice of the stooped old lady , or the game-show co-host . The voice of the Martial Arts Badass Chick . <br> My deep crush and secret shame , Hillary Hsing . <br> To the left were Hill and the Dubs , and to the right were my car , a commute , and the harsh smack in the face of a house  --  my house  --  with most of the furniture removed from it . <br> I went right , and down the stairs . <br> <br> Chapter Two <br> <br> The Five slowed to nothing just north of La Jolla , a dead stop , and the cigarettes kept staring at me from their slot below the stereo . I did n't give in . I just rolled down the windows and sat , waiting for something to move . And finally , in my pants pocket , there was a kind of motion : the heart-stopping buzz of my phone signaling the receipt of a text message . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all been out drinking when I entered her number into my contacts , and I had n't realized she had the silent " H " in her last name . <br> " why did n't you stop in ? " the message said . <br> I started to thumb a reply , but traffic began creeping along again , so I called her . <br> " Andy , " she said . " Andy . Are you okay ? " Hillary was born in London and grew up between there and Hong Kong , where her family had business . Her prep school accent was sublime . <br> " Do n't know , really . " <br> She sighed . " Why did n't you come over ? Lam has something for you . It 's in a big bottle . He says you should be celebrating . " <br> " Lam is crazy . " <br> " He is crazy . But he 's sweet . They all feel bad for you , Andy . I feel bad for you . " <br> My wife slept with one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done so . Straight up . This surprised me , because I had believed for several months  --  at least  --  that she was just too busy or tired for sex . I know I would n't have been much of a participant , and she was a busy woman , I suppose . Busy getting nailed by her client . As I 'd been drifting along , Elise had been busy living . <br> When she told me we were getting a divorce , I said okay without much of a pause . I felt like I deserved it , knowing it in a way no one else did : my heart was secretly devoted to Hillary Hsing . Hill and I had been talking on the phone and visiting each other 's offices almost every working day for nearly two years . Two years of " accidental " run-ins in the lobby , and proximate seating in group lunches with the Dubs . Two years of cracked fortune cookies and glances over water glasses . Month after month of text messages  --  hello good night see you tomorrow  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . <br> Even though we were both nominally devoted to someone else and nothing had ever explicitly been said or done or felt between Hillary and me , I still thought I deserved to be stoned to death . Mental adultery ; my affections had gone elsewhere . Elise 's request for a divorce seemed reasonable . <br> " I 'm fine , " I said . Lam 's gift was tempting , however , and I tried to calculate how much time I 'd lose driving if I got off at the next exit and went back to the city to get it . <br> " Andy , " she said . " That e-mail I sent  --  " An incoming call chimed through , clipping her voice . <br> " Hill , hold on , I need to grab this . " I was certain for an instant it would be Vikas , phoning to let me know that corporate had heard one of his bumps and I was now fired . <br> " Call me later , " she said , and I glanced down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the display . <br> " I will . " I pressed the answer button . " Hello ? " <br> " Are you okay ? " my sister asked . <br> " Everyone is asking me that same question today . What is up with that ? " <br> " Andrew , stop it . Are you okay ? Where are you ? " <br> " On the Five . Like Solana Beach . Creeping . " I rolled on past the Solana exit . Lam 's gift could wait until tomorrow . " I 'm fine , " I said . <br> " You 're not . I can tell . " <br> " Okay , I 'm not fine . Jesus Christ . Of course I 'm not fine , Leigh . What the fuck do you think ? " <br> " Do n't get like that . Come over and have dinner with us . " <br> " I need to go home . I mean , I need to go to my house . And see what 's left . " <br> " Come over , Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going to be very good company . I may get drunk . I may drink myself to the point of stupor . " <br> " Andy , you ca n't  --  " <br> " Grant me tonight . Come on . Elise is now officially moved out . My things are gone . My things , Leigh . I need to mourn their departure . " <br> "  --  no , it 's Hannah 's media program . The interview part is tomorrow . The shadow day . " <br> Hannah . My almost-sixteen-year-old niece . She was a sophomore at the alternative arts high school , and had asked a few weeks earlier if she could follow me around at work for a day with a camcorder . <br> " Oh , shit , " I said . <br> " Do you not want to ? I can call them , maybe she can reschedule ? " <br> " No , no , no , I just totally forgot . Totally . Forgot . " <br> " You really do n't have to . I know you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leigh . What time ? " <br> " Are you sure ? " <br> " I 'm sure . Time ? " <br> " She 's supposed to be with you for a full school day to get credit . But we can fudge . No later than nine ? " <br> " No later than nine . " I passed a car broken down next to the concrete median divider . <br> " Do n't sleep in , " Leigh Anne said . <br> " I may not have an alarm clock anymore . " I was only half joking . " No , I have an alarm on my phone . I wo n't sleep in . " <br> " I love you , Andy . I know you 're upset . Do n't go overboard tonight . " <br> " Thank you . I love you too . " <br> Five years older than me , Leigh Anne worked as a career counselor for several local school districts . Her husband , Lieutenant Matthew Packard Sr. , USN , was a chaplain in the navy , and seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So when my sister was alone with her daughter , Hannah , and her son , Matt Number Two ( I refused to call him Junior ) , Uncle Andy tried to help out . Leigh and I had n't been so close when we were kids ; she liked boys and antagonizing our mother , while my brother Jason and I liked baseball , thunderstorms , and setting things on fire . I never really knew my sister until we both found ourselves in Southern California . I needed a place to stay , and she needed help with her kids . After Jason died , we grew much closer . <br> At Encinitas , their exit , I thought maybe I should just go and spend the night with them . I pulled off the highway , but drove right on past their road , figuring they did n't much want to watch me wallowing in self-pity . On top of that , I did n't want Hannah or Matt Number Two to see me getting loaded . <br> Down at the Coast Highway I turned north . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bikes . And gawkers . Slowly driving gawkers . I cursed myself for getting off the Five . From time to time I looked out at the ocean where a sailboat pounded north through the waves , probably beating its way back up to the little yacht basin at Oceanside . Elise and I had talked about getting a sailboat sometimes . That would have been good . <br> I would have liked a sailboat . <br> Past Leucadia and the big lagoon I aimed myself back up and away from the sea . Over the freeway that would have had me home by now , and east into the dry brown suburbs . My development , when I turned into it , looked dusty , ash-covered . Like a sepia-toned photograph , but real life . The houses and cars and yards seemed filthy and gray , and the palm trees and ornamentals in the dirty yards were limp . Dead . <br> My neighbors liked to ask me when the rain would come . I should know , right ? Here I was , Mr. Meteorologist , a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an AMS seal of approval .
