<p> AN ALTERNATIVE TO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION <p> Editor  --  Your July 13 editorial , " Reaping What UC Sowed on Affirmative Action , " would have better been titled " Reaping What Civil Rights Leaders Sowed on Affirmative Action . " <p> Civil rights leaders have been brain-washing black youth for years that they can not succeed in this " racist " world without special preferences . It should be no surprise that black applicants are afraid to attend a school that believes in their ability to stand on their own without any favoritism . <p> This is not what James Meredith or Rosa Parks fought for when they challenged the truly hostile environment of Alabama and Mississippi 40 years ago in order to assert their civil rights . It is a major step backwards when today 's black students are afraid to compete on a level playing field . <p> Nevertheless , I agree with your suggestions of looking into alternatives to encourage diversity . I especially like your idea of admitting the top 4 percent from each California high school as this would give hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many whites and Asians are n't privileged and they need to be part of the picture too . While " character indexing " will certainly help blacks and Hispanics , it will give these forgotten poor whites and Asians hope too . <p> DAVID KURRENT <p> Pinole <p> . <p> BEYOND TEST SCORES <p> Editor  --  Your editorial , " Reaping What UC Sowed on Affirmative Action , " in the Sunday , July 13 issue was superb . Of particular note is your statement affirmative action not meaning accepting unqualified students , but instead allowing " consideration of factors and qualifications other than simply test scores and grades , which are not necessarily predictors of ultimate career success . " Obviously , Ward Connerly is backpedaling as fast as he can in trying ostensibly to find other means for encouraging minorities and his attack on Herma Hill Kay is the most reprehensible kind of red-herring finger-pointing imaginable . <p> Connerly should have given some thought to his own recent statement , " I am petrified at the fact that we have as far to go as we do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have  --  and had  --  to go was precisely the reason for nurturing affirmative action in the first place and , through it , fostering the talents and abilities of people who do n't fit the simplistic grade and test-score mold . <p> As for the regents having the courage to renounce their 1995 vote in favor of court interpretation of Prop . 209 , until they are strong enough to overcome " Governor Pee Wee 's " ( with thanks to Greg Lucas ) and Connerly 's mean-spirited , " I 've got mine " strong-arm tactics , we wo n't see any progress . <p> On the other hand , the courage of the young people who turned down the proffered UC admission to attend other stellar law schools is truly admirable . They will surely have more impetus to succeed after having made such a choice . <p> ANITA HILL <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> STATE BAR AND MISCONDUCT <p> Editor  --  We note State Bar Administrative Officer and Chief Court Counsel Scott J. Drexel 's criticism ( Letters , July 13 ) of Reynolds Holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a Little Behavior Problem " ( Chronicle , June 29 ) . <p> Mr. Drexel 's rebuttal went along fine until the beginning of his second paragraph commencing , " The State Bar and the State Bar Court take seriously their responsibilities for prosecution and adjudication of attorney misconduct . " <p> When did the State Bar start ? Several years past a charge of dishonesty by an attorney who was a state legislator , in violation of Section 6106 Business and Professions code , was presented the State Bar . <p> The State Bar chief trial counsel responded that attorneys who are legislators are exempt from provisions of Section 6106 ! This assertion was false , yet the " lying legislator " escaped discipline and having been term limited by Proposition 140 , is now an employee of the Legislature at a salary in excess of that in his earlier position . <p> RALPH D. MORRELL <p> Chairman <p> Northern California Coalition <p> for Limited Government <p> Dixon <p> . <p> WELFARE REFORM TRAVESTY <p> Editor  --  Thanks for allowing Greg Lucas from the Sacramento Bureau to give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Legislature . As an artist with a California Arts Council residency , I teach photography to inner-city teens and see many of them driven to the edge of despair as social services are destroyed in the name of " reform . " <p> Mr. Lucas ' commentary was a welcome change from the balanced " just the facts Ma'am " reporting most reporters have to do the other six days of the week . Although he started by leveling the most blame at Wilson and the Republicans for the attacks on poor people , I was glad to see he properly included Clinton and friends as accomplices in this travesty . <p> Please send my regards to Mr. Lucas . With a few more journalists like him , more of us Californians will have some understanding of what is happening in our state . <p> SCOTT BRALEY <p> Oakland <p> . <p> OUTING LEFT AND RIGHT <p> Editor  --  A miracle has occurred ! After years of either ignoring Debra J. Saunders or angrily responding to her perpetual negative attitude , I have finally read a column by her which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 6 column on the " outing " of Congressman Jim Kolbe , R- Ariz. , was the most positive work I have ever read by her . While I disagree that closeted gay public office holders should not have their hypocrisy revealed if they constantly speak and vote against the interests of the gay community in our great country , Kolbe 's vote on the so-called Defense of Marriage Act was validly based on " states rights " and not " gay rights . " He should not have been " outed " for that vote , alone . <p> Ironically Saunders ' column segued beautifully with Mark Sandalow 's excellent column of the " outing " of author David Brock by the right wing because his new book on Hillary Rodham Clinton did n't defame her enough in the eyes of the political right . <p> Brock was quoted from an interview with Esquire as saying that years ago he was derided by the liberal Daily Californian staff because he supported Reagan 's invasion of Grenada . He eventually became in his words a writer who " kills liberals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clinton book when his honesty and integrity caused the right wingers to " out " him because he is gay , a fact that was generally known , and never was a problem before . <p> Sandalow 's column quotes Brock as saying , " There is a self-identified , hard-wired ' conservative movement ' that can function as a kind of neo- Stalinist Thought Police that rivals anything I knew in Berkeley . " <p> Unfortunately that works on the liberal side also . Kolbe is quoted in Saunders ' column as saying , " The enemy . . . is the politics of exclusion . " I wholeheartedly agree with both . Demagogues , whatever their stripe , act as major roadblocks to productive political dialogue . <p> DUKE SMITH <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ENGLAND 'S PRIDE <p> Editor  --  I 'm sorry that columnist Scott Ostler ( Sunday , July 13 ) has such a problem with England 's seeming pride in its judicial past which included capital punishment . Perhaps its pride is , rather , derived from the fact that the state no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nice if his next diatribe were directed against the " barbarity " that our society still tolerates , instead of his imaginings about another country 's past . <p> I would much rather have an amusement park ride than debates regarding the merits of gas chambers versus lethal injections , would n't he ? <p> DIANE DelMONTE <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> OUTCRIES <p> EDITOr  --  In the matter of C. Sykes ' July 6 letter , our family 's favorite authoritarian letter writers since the early 1980s are Dorothy Applegate ( our most favorite ) , Tom Edwards ( our second most favorite ) , Ed Arnold , Denis Kray , Pete Laurence , Richard Carlson and Luke Asbury . We thrive on controversy . It brings out the best in us . <p> Tom Edwards and these other letter writers are expressing their own suppressed tendencies ( similar to the accused ) in the disguise of their own " vilification , calumny and inflammatory " outcries . It is a psychological process called projection . <p> These outcries give the ultra-conservatives an extremely unique opportunity to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is intelligent to develop these qualities ( that we see in others ) within ourselves . <p> DICK KING <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> WAR BRIDES ' REUNION <p> Editor  --  Do you know a war bride from World War II ? If so , you 'll want to let them know that the War Brides of World War II will be holding their fourth annual reunion October 31-November 2 at the Best Western Hotel in Arlington , Va . <p> If you 'd like more information , please contact the War Brides at P.O.
