The next generation may call me old-fashioned , but these counterfelt clearings really work By Gary Clancy // My wife and children claim I 'm not much on keeping up with the times . Okay , I 'll admit I fought hard to keep my favorite bell-bottomed jeans long after they had gone out of style . But hey , I could n't see spending good money on fashionable pants with pleated fronts and straight legs when the old bells were still in wearable shape . Then , just a couple of years ago , my oldest daughter took me aside and said , " Dad , do you realize that you 're the only man I know who still has long sideburns ? They went out of style ages ago ! " " They did ? " I replied , genuinely shocked . " Huh . Me and Jim Zumbo still wear them . " So I guess an incident that occurred in western Illinois last fall should n't have surprised me . I had just spent an incredible early November day hunting over a mock scrape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at camp about the impressive bucks that had paid a visit to my creation . But as I raved on , four of the other hunters in camp-all of whom were about the same age as my oldest children-stared at me as if to say , " What in the heck is the old guy talking about ? " When I finally stopped to catch my breath , one of the bowhunters , a late-twenties-something hunter from Pennsylvania , took a hard hit of his Dew and said , " Man , I remember reading about mock scrapes when I was a kid . But I did n't think anyone actually used them anymore . " Call me old-fashioned or just slow to change , but when I find something that works for me , I stick with it . And , kid , mock scrapes work . CURIOSITY CAN KILL Any bowhunter can tell you that the toughest challenge in bowhunting is coming to full draw without getting picked off by a mature whitetail buck . But if you can get these movementsensitive creatures to focus on something-anything-then undetected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overhanging branch above a mock scrape , or sniffing around in the scrape itself , coming to full draw is much simplerand not just for the obvious reason that the animal is preoccupied . Most of the dozens of bucks that have visited my mock scrapes over the years have hung around the area for at least a couple of minutes . That 's plenty of time to get a handle on the adrenaline surging through your veins and wait for a deliberate , relatively easy broadside or quarteringaway shot . WHERE TO SCRAPE Whitetails are fundamentally curious creatures . If a buck sees or smells a mock scrape you can bet he 'll stick his nose in the dirt and do a little rubbing and licking of his own on the overhanging branch . The trick is getting your handiwork noticed by the deer . It does no good to make mock scrapes in an overgrown tangle where you ca n't see more than 20 feet in any direction . Instead , make them along old logging roads and natural deer trails and on ridges in semi-open timber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scrape to find it . However , there 's one exception to this open-country rule : Do n't give in to the common temptation to make mock scrapes along the edge of a field , even if natural scrapes are already there . Mature bucks are seldom bold enough to work field edges during shooting light-most likely , you 'll just be wasting your time . Photograph The most important feature of a mock scrape is the overhanging branch-an aromatic branch . One way to keep the limb fresh is with a saturated Scent Wick , a procedure that demands the use of rubber gloves . // To further play off the animals ' curiosity , I make a mock rub or two on trees alongside or behind my scrapes to attract deer that would otherwise pass by without seeing the ground pawings . If a buck saunters over to inspect the rub , he 'll no doubt see the scrape and turn his attention to it . If you blow your chance on one of these visitors , hang in there . Once a buck has visited a mock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as he 's not spooked-something I 've been able to confirm from daytime stands and with motion-activated cameras at night . WHEN TO MAKE SCRAPES Whitetail scraping activity is at its zenith during the two weeks prior to peak breeding . Naturally , those 14 days are when hunting over mock scrapes is most productive . If you can muster the patience , hunt all day . Even though most bucks visit my scrapes during the first two hours of morning light , I 've had enough animals pay a visit throughout the rest of the day to convince me that all-day sits are well worth the discomfort-plan on the pain and bring along a thick seat pad . That 's not to suggest that the pre-rut is the only time mock scrapes work . On the contrary , I begin making scrapes up to three weeks prior to the beginning of serious natural scraping . Even though it 's a month or more before any does are ready to be bred , a buck is fully capable of breeding . I suspect these early mock scrapes may also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks usually make the year 's first scrapes . When a dominant buck finds one of my early mock scrapes on his turf , I have a hunch it inspires more than just curiosity . And besides , what have I got to lose ? In all of my years hunting over mock scrapes I have yet to see a buck spook around my fake creations . I figure I 've got everything to gain by being the first buck scraping where I hunt . Photograph Once the scrape is cleared , use a stick to work doein-estrus scent into the soil-liquid , gel or paste solutions are fine-then top it off with freeze-dried urine , which will be activated later by precipitation . Photograph Another no-hassle way to keep scrapes fresh is with a scent dripper . Hang the container above the scrape 's overhanging branch so that it drains onto the limb . // HOW TO MAKE SCRAPES There 's nothing scientific about making a mock scrape , but be sure to wear rubber gloves and clean rubber boots when you 're doing so . Any human scent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the scrape positioned upwind and within " gimmee " range of your stand . Other than that , I 'm convinced the most important aspect of a mock scrape is the overhanging branch . Most of the deer I 've witnessed at my scrapes pay little attention to the scrape itself . Only a handful have actually urinated in it . But the " licking branch " gets plenty of attention . It seems to be the real message center of the whole operation . Five feet or so is the perfect height for an overhanging branch , but bucks will work branches substantially lower or higher , even going so far as to stand on their hind legs to get at the thing . If you have the perfect location for a mock scrape , but no overhanging branch , cut a live branch from a tree and wire it in place . I ca n't explain why , but live branches are much more effective than dead ones . I use forehead gland , pre-orbital gland , deer saliva and even tarsal gland scents on the overhanging branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doe-in-estrus urine for doctoring the overhanging branch , and that seemed to work fine , too . Do n't worry about specific brands here . The type of scent you use is not nearly as important as making sure that some scent is always lingering on the branch . I usually have a dozen or so mock scrapes in place at any one time on the properties I hunt , so it 's impossible to personally freshen the scents at each one every day . For many years I 've solved the problem by positioning a Wildlife Research Scent Dripper on a limb above the overhanging branch so that it dribbles scent down the branch and into the scrape . A new product from Wellington Outdoors makes that procedure even easier . The company 's 24 Hour Scent Post attaches directly to the branch and the deer do the rest-the more deer work the branch and nuzzle the Scent Post , the more scent is activated . An even simpler option is to take an absorbent sponge or material such as the Scent Wick from Wildlife Research , apply a generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the overhanging branch with a twist-tie . Once the branch is in place , use a stick to scrape away leaves and grass directly below the branch to form a patch of bare ground roughly the size of a laundry basket . Then use the same stick to work a generous amount of doe-in-estrus lure into the scrape . I also like to work some Mrs. Doe Pee 's freeze-dried urine into the dirt and then sprinkle some on top when I 'm finished . This dry concoction gets activated by moisture at a later date , keeping the scrape freshly scented in my absence . Another sneaky trick for keeping the scrape fresh longer : Bury an entire bottle of scent in the scrape . I use James Valley brand scents for this application because they come in convenient small jars . Poke a half-dozen holes in the cap of the jar with a hammer and nail , then bury the bottle just beneath the scrape 's surface . It works like a champ . Whether a mock scrape lures a buck into revisiting the scrape after discovering it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for you to draw your bow without being detected , you 're the winner . And despite what my family might say about my bells and ' burns , winning with whitetails never goes out of style . Photograph If you use bottled scents , try this trick : Punch holes in the lid of a scent bottle and , using a stick , dig a hole in the scrape just deep enough to bury the jar . // <p>
