" Any reporter who covers crime knows that when the flash-bang goes off at the front door , the SWAT team is storming the back door , " says correspondent Elaine Shannon . And so , when Pablo Escobar Gaviria , the ferocious leader of the Medellin drug cartel , surrendered to authorities in Colombia last week , Shannon knew that the real story lay elsewhere . " Escobar is a terrific sound- and-light show , " she says . " But people of such towering stupidity always flame out . " In her eyes , the group to watch is the Cali cartel . And , as deftly laid out by her in one of this week 's cover stories , its members have the brains . <P> " I look at organized-crime groups the way I might analyze companies in which I am considering investing , " says Shannon , who has kept tabs on the Cali group since 1984 . " Medellin had more wholesale and retail outlets , but the organizations were sloppy and high-handed . Cali , on the other hand , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and security . They 're like Detroit and the Japanese automakers used to be . " <P> Shannon is the author of Desperados : Latin Drug Lords , U.S. Lawmen , and the War America Ca n't Win . The book was turned into last year 's Emmy-winning mini- series Drug Wars : The Camarena Story . She began working on our cover piece last fall by interviewing U.S. drug-trafficking experts . In March she went to Colombia to describe the world of the cartel chiefs . <P> Meanwhile , TIME 's Latin America bureau chief , John Moody , and Bogota reporter Tom Quinn had been angling for an interview with cartel patriarch Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela . Finally , word came in April that the " Chess Player " was ready to talk . Moody and Quinn flew from Bogota to Cali and waited tensely for a phone call . " We began to worry : Had Rodriguez changed his mind or , worse , was this some elaborate trap ? " John recalls . About 50 journalists have been killed in Colombia since 1980 . But the call eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Cali chief talked calmly . " There was no blood dripping from fangs , no guns in hidden holsters , no ugly threats , " says Moody . " My abiding impression of Rodriguez is that he could be anyone 's dad or uncle . " And that 's the true terror .
