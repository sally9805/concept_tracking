<p> There 's not much joy in buying a new roof Getting furniture reupholstered gives you something of beauty to enjoy . New carpeting or a bright new paint job will surely give you at least a little pleasure . But a new roof , unless you 've let the old one deteriorate to the point where you have buckets strewn about the house , wo n't make much difference to you . <p> There will , however , be a big difference in your wallet . Roofing work is expensive . And unless you make your roof purchase carefully , you may spend hundreds or thousands of dollars more than necessary and get less-than-satisfactory results . <p> Even if you avoid a major mess , minor problems are common-damage to plantings around the house , uneven courses of shingles , or lengthy delays , for example . <p> The key to success is to find a good firm , agree in writing as to exactly what you want done , and keep a close eye on the job as it progresses . <p> The following pages should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a good job . We 'll also suggest actions you can take on your own to maintain your roof . Choosing a Firm <p> First , you will have to match a contractor to your roof Some work on all types , including slate , wood shake and shingle , asphalt shingle , metal , built-up , and single ply . Others are more specialized . Some make repairs on roof types that they do n't install or install types that they wo n't repair . <p> Your odds of being satisfied are better , of course , with firms that have consistently satisfied other customers . Check complaints filed against each firm with local government consumer affairs offices . <p> One way to increase your chances of satisfaction is to contract for roofing work on a fixed-price basis , with most or all of the price to be paid after the work is completed . <p> It 's well to think in advance about the kind of leverage you 'll have if you are not satisfied with a firm 's performance . By choosing a firm that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs officials and licensing authorities will have the threat of license cancellation as one form of leverage in working to resolve a dispute . You also enhance the chance that the local authorities will feel you deserve their help-because you have taken the care to choose a licensed contractor . Ask any contractor you are seriously considering for proof of a currently valid license ; then verify by calling the appropriate licensing officials . <p> An additional advantage of dealing with a licensed contractor is that local jurisdictions often have financial-responsibility provisions built into their licensing requirements . These provisions come in two forms . <p> First , there are bonding requirements . Many jurisdictions require firms to secure a $5,000 or $10,000 bond from a private bonding company . If a firm fails to perform under your contract , you will be able to seek compensation from the bonding company . This is especially important if a firm goes bankrupt or simply disappears . A bonding company may require that you get a court judgment against a firm before it will release funds to you . But , like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you if it believes that you have a sound case . <p> A $5,000 bond will not fully protect you , of course , if your loss is $8,000 . Furthermore , if a firm goes bankrupt , there are likely to be other customers with claims . The bonding company 's total liability is for the amount of the bond , and , in most jurisdictions , claims are paid based on the date of filing . If another customer files before you , there may be little or nothing for you . <p> A second type of financial responsibility provision that may be built into licensing requirements is participation in a claims fund where the local government pools some of the license fees it collects from contractors to provide funds for settling complaints . <p> If you wish to give yourself protection beyond that afforded under state and local licensing requirements , you can ask your contractor to secure for you a " performance bond " in the amount of your contract price . You can expect this to add an extra 1% to 5% to the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover your full claim and is not subject to other customers ' claims . Although performance bond requirements are common in contracts with commercial customers , they are rare in contracts with homeowners , and a responsible but small contractor may find it difficult to get one . Nonetheless , this is an option you may want to discuss with potential contractors . <p> Insurance . If a third party is injured by a contractor working on your home , or if one of the contractor 's employees is injured , you might be liable . The best protection is to be sure the contractor has liability and workmen 's compensation insurance . The licensing provisions of some jurisdictions call for proof of insurance . But the only way to be sure a contractor has insurance is to ask to see a " certificate of insurance . " Insurance companies readily issue such certificates . <p> Other Signs of Stability . You want to be as sure as you can be that your roofer will be around to finish your job and that you wo n't be left fending off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your house . <p> A good way to get evidence of financial soundness is to ask for , and check , credit references . You can ask for the names of major materials suppliers . Then ask the suppliers how much credit is commonly extended and what the contractor 's recent payment performance has been . <p> You can also drive by to take a look at the contractor 's place of business and you can check how long the firm has been in operation . An easy way to check back a few years is to look at an old phone book . Or you can check with your local Better Business Bureau . <p> Your Warranty Protection . You may get two types of warranties on roofing work : a warranty on materials from the manufacturer and a warranty on workmanship from the roofer . The shingle warranties offered by the major manufacturers are very similar . Asphalt shingle manufacturers , for example , agree to pay for the cost , including labor , of repair or replacement of shingles proven to be " defective . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you buy . The manufacturer 's exposure is reduced on a pro rata basis each year over the course of the warranty 's duration . On a 25-year warranty , for example , the manufacturer 's liability would be reduced by 4% of the total labor and materials cost each year . <p> Most roofers ' warranties of their labor are much less well spelled out . Some simply say " labor guaranteed to X year(s) . " Others say " guaranteed against defects in workmanship for X year(s) . " It 's not clear whether these statements mean that you will recover only if you can prove that the work was done improperly , or whether it is enough merely to show that the roof leaks . It 's also unclear whether , if the workmanship is defective , the contractor must provide only labor , or must also provide required materials . <p> You 'll be better protected if you find a roofer who will let you write into your contract in addition to all other warranties : " If roof leaks within X year(s) , except as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor and materials to eliminate all leaks . " <p> Roofers ' warranties most often run for a single year , but some are for two years , five years , or more . And most have different policies for different types of roofs . Remember that a long warranty period wo n't do you any good if the firm is n't around to honor it . <p> Price . The quality of a roofer 's work and its financial responsibility are , and should be , the first considerations for most homeowners . No price is a bargain for a roof that leaks or looks unattractive or that is simply never installed . But once you have identified roofers that measure up on these factors , price becomes critical . <p> Most roofing work is done on a fixed-price basis , following an estimate . You should get several bids . We ca n't give you a firm rule as to exactly how many bids you should get . There is no way to know in advance how much the next bid will gain you . Getting another bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , if it is higher than one you already have . <p> Here are a few guidelines on getting bids : Invite out more firms than you really care to see . Some wo n't show up for months , if ever . When you 've seen enough , simply call the remaining firms and cancel . Use estimators as your consultants . When getting your first few bids , you probably wo n't know exactly what work is needed . So ask each firm for its suggestions and the reasons behind them ; then weigh the arguments and settle on your own set of specifications . Once you have a firm description of your specifications , call back the firms you 've already seen to invite them to adjust their bids , and give a copy of the specifications to any additional firms you wish to have bid . You probably do n't have to be there when the estimator comes unless you suspect your roof has defects that can be spotted only from inside your house-most roofing estimators are accustomed to working up bids from the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a copy of your specifications . Get more bids on larger jobs . If you can save 10% on a $5,000 job , that 's $500 , but a 10% saving on a $500 job is only $50 . Get more bids on jobs where labor , rather than parts or materials , is relatively important . Firms have to pay roughly the same amount for parts and materials , but they may differ significantly in what they pay per hour for labor and in how much their workers can accomplish per hour . Get more bids if it 's easy-for example , if you 'll be home anyway or if you can arrange for the roofer to see the job without your being there . <p> For small roofing repair jobs , some firms work on a time and materials basis . Avoid this arrangement if possible ; you 're much safer with a fixed-price contract . But if you must pay by the hour , check the hourly labor rate , whether that rate is for one or two workers , the minimum charge , whether you 're charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll find getting this information is like pulling teeth . How to Deal with a Roofer <p> It 's not enough to choose a good roofer . To get the roof you want , when you want it , at the best possible price , you must also deal with firms carefully . <p> Be sure you know what you need . Inspect your roof carefully . Does it all need to be replaced or are parts of it newer , in better shape ? Are the gutters all right ? How about the flashings ? Is there rot in the fascias or sheathing ? ( Sheathing can often be inspected from the attic . ) You can get free help from each estimator you talk with ; each may point to slightly different remedies . Although to make your shopping meaningful you will want estimates on about the same work from each firm , you will also want to ask for their proposed variances from the basic work plan , the reasons for these variances , and the effects of the variances on cost . <p> Specify in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimators give you will often be imprecise . Simply write in your own specifics before you sign . For example , for an asphalt shingle roof . Specify , by picture or words , exactly what roof areas are to be covered . Indicate whether or not old shingles are to be removed . The reasons for removing old shingles before applying new ones are , first , that additional layers may overstrain underlying sheathing and structural lumber and , second , that old shingles can become warped as they dry out and age , causing new shingles to appear uneven . For these reasons , most of the local codes prohibit application of more than two layers of shingles except in unusual circumstances . On the other hand , extra layers of shingles provide somewhat better insulation , and it costs less to roof over than to remove old shingles before re-roofing . If shingles are to be removed , indicate that a layer of asphalt felt is to be applied under the shingles as required by local codes . Also indicate the weight of the felt . Some roofers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tear and gives an extra measure of insulation and protection against leakage . But some code requirements are only for 15-pound material . Specify the types of shingles to be used-their color , shape , and weight . Light colors tend to absorb less heat and may therefore last longer , but there 's no hard evidence on how much longevity you gain , and dark may look better on your house . Using shingles with a 35-year warranty rather than a 25-year warranty might cost you about 50% extra and we have been able to find no scientific evidence that 35-year shingles will really last significantly longer than 25-year shingles . Indicate which , if any , flashings are to be replaced , which are simply to be resealed , and what materials are to be used . Unless the contract says so specifically , a roofer is not legally required to repair or replace flashings . If you have copper flashings now , most experts recommend that you reuse them . Aluminum flashings , on the other hand , are often replaced since they are more frail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be aluminum , copper , or some other material-and what weight they will be . If flashings are to be copper , insist on at least 16-ounce ( per square foot ) material , and try to get 20-ounce material for valleys . If flashings will be aluminum , insist on at least 0.016 weight for chimney and vent flashings , and at least 0.019 weight for valleys . A weight of 0.025 is better still . The heavier the flashings , the less the chance that they will be damaged on installation or will erode away , and the greater the possibility that they will be reusable in the future . Write in a requirement that the firm haul away all debris ; otherwise , you may be stuck with a mess and no legal right to make the contractor remove it . It costs a contractor about $100 to haul away shingles removed from an average-size roof . Indicate whether metal drip edges are to be installed at the eaves and the rakes . These edges , which prevent water from rolling back under the shingle edge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a dollar per foot . <p> Be similarly specific on other types of roofs . For example , say how many layers and what kind of gravel or slag is to go on a built-up roof , what grade of shingles is to be used on a wood roof , and what type and weight of metal and paint are to be used on a metal roof . <p> If possible , require in the contract that the firm secure a permit and that work be inspected and approved before final payment . To get more than a cursory check from the ground , you will have to supply a ladder and ask specifically about each item required by your contract . The permit also gives your local building inspector an extra measure of leverage in pressing for correction if a job is done improperly . <p> Indicate in the contract when work is to begin and how long it is to take . Given frequent customer dissatisfaction with delays , you will want at least to have the right to get out of a contract and find another roofer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a fixed price for the work to be done and the formula for covering any contingencies . You should be able to get a binding contract at the price your firm gave you in its estimate . Most firms , however , will insist on a loophole for the possibility that they will find damaged fascias , sheathing , or structural lumber . Most of the contracts we saw simply stated that the required carpentry would be done on a " per foot " or a " time and materials " basis . You should be sure your contract states how charges will be figured . Typical is $1.50 to $2.50 per square foot , or per linear foot . Also ask that the contract give you the option of choosing another firm to do your carpentry . <p> Seek to pay for your work as late as you can , and indicate in the contract what the schedule of payments is to be . Although companies have their standard policies on payment scheduling , most will bend to accommodate a customer with good credit standing . In particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pay in full until the job is completed . Press for enough leeway in your payment schedule that your house is likely to have to face some stormy weather before the final payment is due . <p> Be sure that the firm carries workmen 's compensation and general liability insurance . Before you sign a contract , ask to see certificates of insurance . If the insurance documentation is not available at the time you wish to sign , you can write into the contract : " Contractor is required to provide homeowner with certificates of workmen 's compensation insurance and personal liability and property damage insurance . Work is not to commence , and no payments are required , before such certificates are provided . " In addition , it 's a good idea to write in a statement that you " will be held harmless for any damages which would be covered by general liability or workmen 's compensation insurance . " <p> Press for a strong written guarantee . On asphalt shingle roofs , manufacturers ' guarantees ranging from 20 years to 35 years are most common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single year , but you may be able to get a 2-year , 5-year , or longer one . <p> If after signing a contract you wish you had n't , move to cancel it . If a roofer solicited your business at your home , you are free to cancel until midnight of the third day after signing . Be sure to put your cancellation letter in writing . It is sufficient to get it in the mail within the 3-day cancellation period , but it 's a good idea to send it by registered mail so that you can get a record of the mail date and of its receipt by the contractor . <p> If possible , be at home some of the time when the work is being done . If you are , you can catch early any misunderstandings about the materials to be used , and you can spot any gross flaws in workmanship . <p> If you are not at home , be sure to leave a number where you can be reached . Your roofing firm will do better by you if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems arise-such as problems with unexpected sheathing or an unexpected second layer of old shingles . <p> If possible , give the roofers access to a toilet , an occasional cold drink , and other comforts . <p> Keep records . Keep a file with your contract and specifications , any contract modifications , invoices , canceled checks , and lien releases from subcontractors and materials suppliers . <p> If you are not satisfied with your roofer 's work , complain . First negotiate directly with your roofing firm . If that does n't work , complain to one of your state or local complaint-handling services . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS ( 2 ) <p> <p> This article is excerpted , with permission , from Washington Consumers ' Checkbook , fall 1991 . <p>
