The crowd in the Hilton ballroom could n't have been more excited if Elvis had turned up . Instead , this being Washington , the star was a fiftysomething politician , and as soon as his trademark helmet of white hair breezed through the door at stage right , 400 freshly elected conservative state legislators leaped to their feet and chanted , " Newt ! Newt ! Newt ! " By the time Newt Gingrich had concluded his now familiar excoriation of the liberal welfare state , he had the faithful rushing the dais as if they were at a rock concert , shouldering each other aside just to be near their hero . An agile woman from Oregon exclaimed to her friends , " I touched him ! " <P> Gingrich , newly anointed Speaker of the House and slayer of the Old Order , was naturally pleased by this adulation , but also somewhat shaken . True , he had presumed to plan months before the Nov. 8 election exactly how he would lead the Republican House that begins its work this week . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor on the intense public and press interest in his every casual utterance , nor on the spectacle of the President scrambling to pull himself aboard the Republican tax-cut bandwagon . Gingrich , who classifies most experiences as either neat or weird , pronounced these very weird . Yet he takes his new prominence quite seriously . On the morning after the Hilton speech , a rainy Saturday in mid-December , he met with a dozen of his top advisers and asked them , almost plaintively , " How would you use who I am becoming ? " <P> Right now Americans are divided three ways on Gingrich : they love him , loathe him or ca n't figure out who he is . But what Gingrich is becoming is this : the pre-eminent political leader in America . As the new Republican * rulers of Congress converge on Washington to begin their reign this week , they will find the Democrats still in shock from their repudiation in the November elections  --  and grumbling that they are leaderless to boot . President Clinton , they complain , has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . Said a senior Administration official : " Part of the strategy , to the extent there is a strategy , is to wait and see what Gingrich and company do . " The President 's pre-Christmas promise of a middle-class tax break and wholesale cuts in Cabinet departments only seemed to ratify the G.O.P. agenda . Senate majority leader Bob Dole , meanwhile , has been distracted by travel and fund raising in pursuit of his presidential ambitions , and is playing the cautious establishmentarian . Into this vacuum Gingrich gladly rushes , seizing the initiative and setting Washington 's agenda . <P> Though he can be meanspirited ( suggesting that Democrats are somehow responsible when a woman in South Carolina admits to drowning her two young sons ) and just plain goofy ( sponsoring a bill to apply U.S. law to space colonies ) , Gingrich is providing the energy , imagination and confidence that , at least at this pregnant moment , seem lacking among other leaders of both parties . The new Speaker will gavel the House down to real work three weeks earlier than usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the way it operates . He will seek speedy passage of a balanced-budget amendment , tax breaks , spending cuts and other measures the Republicans promised in their " Contract with America . "
