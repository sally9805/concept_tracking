CON More money . More teachers . More time . The oldest recipe for school improvement is " more . " Popular today is the push to extend the school day . With champions like Sen. Edward Kennedy , Secretary of Education Arne Duncan , and President Obama , advocates are ready to spend whatever it takes to add more time to the school day . The president recently declared that " the challenges of a new century demand more time in the classroom . " " More " is a winning political strategy . It avoids hard choices or the need to identify waste . But excellence requires finding ways to accomplish more rather than to get more . Plus , we have tried the " more " strategy . Largely because of a hiring binge that has boosted teacher ranks 50 percent faster than enrollment over 35 years , school spending has skyrocketed . After inflation , spending has tripled in four decades . The results ? Not so great . Adding time is expensive . National adoption of the extended-day model used by schools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would cost $40 billion to $70 billion a year . With the same teachers , materials , and techniques in place , it 's unclear how we can be confident this money will purchase something other than more of the same . Spent otherwise , those dollars could finance raises of $50,000 or $60,000 for the nation 's 1 million best teachers -- doubling pay for the top third . Now , more time certainly can be a good idea . A defining characteristic of high-performing charter schools like the KIPP academies is a longer school day and Saturday instruction . Of course , their recipe also calls for talented and impassioned faculty , firm discipline , a powerful school culture , and students who have chosen to be there . Unfortunately , the " more time " crowd focuses only on the most expensive part of that recipe , apparently hoping the other ingredients will sort themselves out if kids sit in classes longer . In fact , research is more mixed than advocates usually acknowledge . A 2003 Review of Educational Research analysis tallied dozens of studies and found no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies , including the 1994 National Education Commission on Time and Learning report , have found increased instructional time modestly linked with higher achievement -- but that argues for making good use of time before seeking more . Two decades of research from the National Center for Education Statistics suggest that teachers spend only about 68 percent of class time engaged in instruction ; the rest is consumed by everything from paperwork to assemblies . But advocates find it easier to demand more time than to dirty their hands squeezing fat out of the school day . Fad ? Directly relevant here is the " small high schools " fad . In the late 1990s , reformers noticed small high schools had surprising success with at-risk students . Billions were spent in urban districts on new , small high schools or to reconfigure high schools into smaller " schools " that shared a building . Results were disappointing . The idea was sensible enough , but it turned out that many of the new schools lacked the talented teachers , impassioned founders , autonomy , and intensive support that made the pioneering efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 26 schools in the multimillion-dollar ELT initiative , caution is warranted . Beyond money , these schools are getting exceptional support , coaching , and acclaim . It 's hard to be sure how much the time itself really matters . Simply locking students in mediocre schools for additional hours presumes that the proper response to chaos or tedium is more of the same . And ham-handedly extending the day can disrupt fruitful activities for millions of youths who have rewarding lives after 3 o'clock . A longer day could make sense for many students and offer a respite for stretched families . Where schools know how to use the hours , where talented teachers have the ideas and energy , and where families think the student would benefit , OK . But before proposing expensive new policies , wedging kids into lousy schools for hundreds of extra hours , and imposing substantial new demands on teachers , let 's ensure schools are making good use of the time they have . Excellence requires finding ways to accomplish more rather than to get more . Frederick M. Hess is director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of Tough Love for Schools .
