Section : U.S. News The moment is ripe , but politics-as-usual may spoil the chance <p> Years , and likely even decades , will pass before as auspicious a moment comes along for saving Social Security . Start with general agreement that there 's a problem  --  a baby boomer problem  --  that needs to be fixed . Add a second-term president  --  the baby boomers ' president  --  intent on building his political legacy and absorbed by the idea of ensuring that the system does n't run short of money as his generation swells the ranks of retirees . Add rarities like a muscle-bound economy , a federal budget in the black , and the absence of election-year posturing , and suddenly , surprisingly , the planets seem aligned for reform . But before anyone gets too high on promise , consider some other things : Washington is so consumed by political gamesmanship and mistrust  --  and the country is so unsure of what it wants  --  that this opportunity looks likely to fade . <p> As President Clinton this week convenes a two-day White House summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dialogue "  --  there is still nothing approaching consensus on a reform plan or even how to start down the road to a deal . And the clock is ticking . Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel estimates that the window of opportunity will start to close " if we 're not making any progress by July . " <p> Tough choices . All eyes remain on Clinton , who insists that he wants a deal . " I believe he really does want to achieve this , " says Bill Archer , chairman of the crucial House Ways and Means Committee . " But he 's got to be willing to make tough political choices . " <p> For the first time last week , there was an indication that Clinton may be ready to move . Administration officials told U.S. News that the president is leaning toward a bargaining framework much like the one that resulted in 1997 's remarkable balanced-budget agreement . While the president will not put forth a specific bill , as many Republicans have called for , his advisers say that he will outline " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late next month . Then he will invite Republican congressional leaders to join White House negotiators and Hill Democrats in a closed-door Social Security summit to hash out a deal . <p> Archer is one of the few lawmakers who participated in both Social Security overhauls  --  in 1977 with President Carter and 1983 with President Reagan  --  and knows firsthand that only presidents can direct Congress through Social Security 's roiling political waters . " The only way we 're going to have an opportunity to bring this to culmination is for the president to submit a plan and defuse the politics , " says Archer , whose committee would draft any Social Security reform bill . But even moderate Democrats like Texas 's Charles Stenholm are still baiting the Republican side : " Republicans are in the majority . It 's incumbent upon them to lead . The president only needs to establish a framework . " <p> Elusive compromise . Clinton administration officials insist they wo n't let themselves be pushed into putting forth a bill . " We do n't want our ideas to be DOA as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adviser . A detailed blueprint would only become a target for attack , as Clinton learned from his 1992 health care proposal . The administration 's hope is that Clinton would present ideas that Democrats could rally around and that the public would like , such as rejecting any reform plan that cut benefits for current Social Security recipients . But the goal would be to include an olive branch for conservatives and others , such as by signaling Clinton 's willingness to go along with some kind of minimal privatization scheme for future recipients . One option : a hybrid system that " adds on " modest private accounts to a worker 's regular Social Security benefits . <p> Clinton 's plan would cut through the who-jumps-first dilemma while isolating the bargainers from hard-liners in both parties . It 's clear that any deal is going to leave unhappy people on both sides of the aisle . Many Democrats worry that Clinton will become an undertaker to the most enduring legacy of Franklin Roosevelt and the Democratic Party . They fear that Clinton , eager for consensus , will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton already has expressed " open minded " interest in the idea and that he and his aides are currently studying variations of it . But conservative Republicans are set on getting substantial privatization and folding a big tax cut into the mix . <p> Assuming both sides are sincere about making a deal  --  as they were about balancing the budget  --  a summit may be the only hope . But that just gets people into the room . Then the question becomes whether Clinton 's tactical mastery can translate into a significant legislative accomplishment , something that has eluded most of his presidency . The answer will depend on whether he can steer everyone through one of the most complex social-policy thickets the nation has faced . <p> Stated simply , the problem with Social Security is that it starts running out of money around 2032 . That 's when , with the 76 million baby boomers in retirement and a smaller number of workers contributing taxes into the system , Social Security funds will cover only 75 percent of benefits . How to come up with the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 2027 ) would help . So would raising the income cap on Social Security taxes beyond the current $68,400 . A good deal of pain can be cushioned by applying the large budget surpluses that are projected over the next two decades . As Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers puts it : " We 've got the money now and a problem later . " <p> At the heart of any reform will be the highly contentious issue of tapping the booming stock market . Should individual workers choose where their Social Security contributions get invested , similar to the way millions of Americans manage their 401(k) plans ? Or should government keep the system largely as it is but invest a small amount of Social Security funds in stocks and bonds , instead of in safe but low return Treasury bills as now ? <p> The attraction of such private retirement accounts is the promise of a greater return on stocks , which have averaged 8.2 percent over the past 40 years . Returns on Social Security over the next 35 years are projected at about 1 percent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stock market mean some workers will do better than others . And Social Security is more than just a retirement system . Some 30 percent of beneficiaries are disabled workers , widows , and the children of deceased workers . Critics claim that most privatization plans include deep cuts in this social-insurance commitment . <p> Still , just last spring , privatization seemed a sure thing  --  and the basis for a Social Security deal . At least that was the conventional wisdom in Washington as influential Democrats like Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan signed on . But now opponents are emboldened by the volatile stock market and voters ' recent rebuke of Republicans . Last week , a coalition of labor unions , African-Americans , women , and other liberal groups  --  looking for payback after helping Democrats to their surprising election results  --  announced the formation of the New Century Alliance for Social Security . Members denounced privatization as something that would destroy Social Security 's guarantee of a minimum retirement income and warned politicians against negotiating with privatization supporters . " We do n't ask arsonists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesse Jackson . Nebraska Sen. Robert Kerrey , a proponent of privatization , shot back at the " doomsayers " who " do not trust the intelligence , ingenuity or fighting spirit of the American people " to come out better by making their own investments . <p> Generational surprise . Such heated public rhetoric may only reflect a similar , if quieter , private debate taking place across America 's dinner tables . That was clear in Edina , Minn. , at the Thanksgiving table of Irv and Katherine Carr . More than 50 family members showed up for the meal that featured three turkeys , a ham , eight pumpkin pies , and three cheesecakes . The Carrs , like most Americans , value Social Security and want to see it survive , but most have not paid close enough attention to propose how to do so . <p> The exceptions are 75-year-old Irv , who retired from his insurance management job last year , and his 24-year-old granddaughter Liz Kramer . It 's Irv  --  who has a standing offer with each of his grandchildren that he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invest it for them  --  who believes privatization will ensure the retirement security of his eight children and 25 grandchildren . ( " If Social Security was a private company and ran their employee pension fund the way Social Security is run , they would be tossed in jail , " he says . ) And it 's Liz , working for a Washington-based group that is fighting privatization , who worries that precipitous change will particularly hurt generations ahead of her . ( " I believe in the concept of Social Security as a building block for retirement , " she says . " So it 's very important to me that it stay as low risk as possible and be guaranteed for as long as someone should live . " ) <p> Social Security reform gets portrayed as a war between generations  --  with baby boomers and the young fearing there will be no retirement savings for them and the elderly seeing change as a threat to their livelihood . But the role reversal in the Carr family shows that American attitudes on such a complex issue are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no politically safe reform . And given that Social Security 's " crisis " lies far in the future , chances are slim for fixing the problem during Washington 's brief moment of opportunity . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Last chance . Reforming the nation 's retirement system may become President Clinton 's ultimate test . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Family feud . It 's not just the politicians who are fighting over how to fix Social Security . Families like the Carrs of Minnesota , gathered for Thanksgiving , ca n't reach consensus either . <p> Joseph P. Shapiro ; Ben Wildavsky ; Kenneth T. Walsh ; Major Garrett ; Franklin Foer <p> Section : U.S. News The Players A Social Security deal rests in many hands Bill Clinton . Only he can lead the way . But while he hankers for a legacy ( beyond Monica ) , even he is not sure what he means by " saving Social Security " : privatization or other less drastic reforms ? While aides battle for his heart and mind , liberals on the outside fret that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " According to White House sources , there will be a plan to open bargaining by January 's State of the Union address . Lawrence Summers . Even more than presidential economic adviser Gene Sperling , he may be a key indicator of the administration 's mood . Conventional wisdom holds that Treasury 's No. 2 is the biggest fan of privatization . But recently , he has cooled . Could it be that this Gore guy is protecting the veep 's 2000 prospects ? As in : Can Gore afford to tick off liberals with a Social Security overhaul ? John Sweeney . Wall Street and right-wingers , the AFL-CIO boss says , dreamed up the Social Security " crisis " as a pretext for trashing the current system . To preserve the status quo , the union pledges to launch " the most aggressive grass-roots campaign " in its history . Which Democrats will be first to throw themselves in the union 's way ? Hillary Clinton . Once maligned as the Democratic Party 's most knee-jerk liberal , she 's now among its best hopes for unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first lady may be the only person in the White House capable of rallying the Democrats ' left and center wings around a single reform . Bob Livingston . The soon-to-be speaker says it 's his No. 1 priority , alongside tax cuts . And he 's just the seasoned closed-door deal maker to work it out with the White House . But if Clinton 's got problems on the left , Livingston has them on the right . He has to contend with a plethora of Republican plans and egos . The key issue may be whether he and Ways and Means Committee Chair Bill Archer can get on the same page . Trent Lott . The majority leader has yet to stake out a clear position . This leaves him plenty of wiggle room for a back-room compromise , as he did with the balanced budget . But after the election debacle , Lott seems in no mood to dole out concessions  --  or trust the White House . Steve Forbes . Will it be a deal or a campaign issue ? Keep an eye on presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libertarians , the **28;1615;TOOLONG candidate will tolerate nothing short of total privatization . Alan Greenspan . Even the most mild kvetching from his economic bully pulpit could sink any reform proposal . Already , the Federal Reserve 's high priest has said that he is keen on the idea of private accounts . But what else does he think ? John Rother . So far , there 's only deafening silence from the top lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons , the group that turned Social Security into the " third rail " of politics . Have its 37 million members decided it just really is not their problem anymore ? The bull market . An ill-timed dive in the Dow Jones industrial average could put a sock in all this talk of sticking retirement dollars in the stock market until the deal-making window closes . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Lawrence Summers <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Hillary Clinton <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Archer <p> By Franklin Foer <p>                @ @ @ @ @
