<p> Forget the hackneyed oysters , chocolate and caviar , aphrodisiacs only for those starved in imagination . The most powerful aphrodisiac is still a well-told story . <p> At least it is in the hands of Chilean author and master storyteller Isabel Allende . Her erotic new book on food , " Aphrodite , " is filled with personal reminiscences , recipes , history and folklore , as well as stories she calls " the greatest enhancement to eroticism , as effective as the most knowing caresses . " <p> Allende , the author of such acclaimed novels as " The House of Spirits " and the evocative collection " The Stories of Eva Luna , " will read from her new book at the PEN/Faulkner Reading Series at 8 p.m . Friday at the Folger Shakespeare Library . <p> She will choose some particularly delectable excerpts to give the flavor of the book , she says in a telephone interview from her home near San Francisco , culminating with the book 's story about a voluptuous woman she calls Colomba , Colomba 's hopeful suitor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $ 26 ) is Allende 's seventh book and the first she 's written since " Paula , " a memoir of her 27-year-old daughter , who died in 1992 following a year-long coma . <p> She admits that the new book takes a much lighter , conversational approach than any of her previous books , but that was intentional . Writing it was a healing process for her , " a way of coming back to the body and senses after seven years of mourning , " the 55-year-old grandmother explains . <p> " Writing this book , I 've been laughing for a year . It 's so wonderful . This book pulled me out of the writer 's block I did n't want to admit I had . " <p> Although the book focuses on food and its powerful influence on the senses , Allende confides that she would be considered , at best , " a decent cook , " but one who ca n't follow a recipe . <p> " I do n't think in a linear way . I invent all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . <p> Her husband , however , is a wonderful cook , she adds . Just seeing him chopping away , rattling pans , evokes feelings of great culinary and romantic anticipation . " A man who cooks is sexy , a woman is n't ; maybe it 's too reminiscent of domestic archetypes , " she observes in her book . <p> She and her husband have even worked out their own private language of food . <p> " If I 'm ready to talk after a fight , but too proud to apologize , I make my Reconciliation Soup . When he smells that cooking , he knows I 'm sorry , " she says . <p> When an amorous night is planned , one of them will put all their favorite foods on the table in no particular order . Fresh salmon , caviar , chocolate and strawberries mean only one thing . <p> " And when he 's not willing to perform , he makes us Mexican food because he knows we 'll eat so much of it we 'll end up sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says with a laugh . <p> That 's far from what happens in her book , however . Like a slow , seductive lover , Allende teases , tempts and titillates with mesmerizing stories and legends about gluttony  --  sexual and otherwise . <p> Allende describes her book 's loose structure ( there is no table of contents and no index ) as equivalent to " a conversation with a friend in the kitchen . " <p> That it is . It meanders . It repeats itself . It includes weird anecdotes , disgusting customs ( if you 're squeamish , do n't read the section that begins , " Food , like eroticism , starts with the eyes , but there are people who will put just about anything in their mouth " ) and discomfiting stories about husbands and stepchildren . <p> But it 's also entertainingly full of Allende 's strong opinions ( " I ca n't imagine why snails are so valued ; alive they are repugnant , and cooked they reek of garlic and soil " ) , plus a treasure-trove of sensuous paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is these long-ago romantic guides that Allende strongly believes should be rediscovered and appreciated . <p> " We live in a world that is so sexualized , but without sensuality , " she insists . " We have separated the brain and the body . We pamper the body , but for aesthetic reasons . We do n't really love it . " <p> Researching her book , she says , gave her the chance to revive some of the captivating ancient tales about food and sensual pleasure that seem to have been forgotten . <p> " Erotic literature is fascinating , " she says enthusiastically . " I found some real jewels in my research , like the Japanese courtesan of the 11th century cavorting with her carp and many other wonderful stories . " <p> More modern , but equally intriguing , tales come from Allende 's own colorful family and friends . The story she plans to read Friday is about her friend Colomba and an amorous art professor . Armed with a picnic basket bulging with Colomba 's favorite vegetarian delicacies ( chilled rose wine , mushroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the professor planned first to sate , then to seduce her . How an irate bull sharing their picnic pasture ruined those plans is part of the story 's charm . <p> Stories like these are the strong point of Allende 's book . The culminating recipe collection is rather limp , but that can be forgiven . Anyone reading this book should not be looking for yet another cookbook  --  or even a manual on lovemaking . As Allende notes , the purpose of an aphrodisiac is to take you " from gluttony to lust . " What you do from there is up to you . <p> As for which aphrodisiac dishes a budding romantic should make , Allende says it depends on the size of the kitchen . <p> " In a tiny kitchen , alone with my lover , it would be an omelet with caviar or a seafood dish . Something that 's simple and fast . If it 's too complicated , you have no energy left for lovemaking afterward , " she counsels . <p> If the kitchen were huge or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the digging , she 'd choose the book 's recipe for an Easter Island aphrodisiac stew that slowly cooks in a covered pit dug in the sand ( or in a very large pot or casserole in the oven . ) <p> But , she adds , " there are truly no real aphrodisiacs . Oh , maybe some drugs that relax you or stimulate you , but it 's what your brain and your imagination attribute to food that turns you on . <p> " What works in every culture , " continues Allende , " is variety . " <p> And a good story . <p> As she writes in her book , " Professional lovers know that with women the best aphrodisiac is words . The G spot is in the ears . " <p> Isabel Allende will read from " Aphrodite " as part of the 1997-98 PEN/Faulkner Reading Series at 8 p.m . Friday in the Elizabethan Theatre of the Folger Shakespeare Library at 201 E.

" What you do from there is up to you . <p> Reconciliation Soup <p> ( 2 servings ) <p> In her book " Aphrodite " ( HarperCollins , $ 26 ) , Isabel Allende writes : " The creation of this soup was a matter not of chance , but of necessity . It is a practically infallible aphrodisiac that I always fix after some terrible fight , a flag of truce that allows me to make peace without humiliating myself too greatly . " In an interview , she adds that because the soup is heady with the aromas of mushrooms and garlic , the instant her husband smells it , he knows she 's ready to kiss and make up . <p> 1/2 cup chopped portobello mushrooms <p> 1/2 cup chopped fresh porcini mushrooms ( 1/4 cup dried ) <p> 1 cup cremini mushrooms <p> 1 clove garlic <p> 3 tablespoons olive oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> 1/4 cup port <p> 1 tablespoon truffle-flavored olive oil <p> Salt and pepper to taste <p> 2 tablespoons sour cream <p> If you ca n't find fresh mushrooms and must use the dried ones , soak them in 1/2 cup of good red wine until they spring up happily ; in the meantime , while they 're soaking , I calmly drink the remainder of the wine . Then I mince the garlic clove for the pure pleasure of smelling my fingers , because I could just as easily use it whole , and then saute it with the mushrooms in the olive oil , stirring vigorously for a few minutes  --  I 've never counted , but let 's say five . I add the stock , the port and the truffled olive oil  --  not quite all of it , I leave a couple of drops to dab behind my ears ; let 's not forget , it 's aphrodisiac . I season with salt and pepper , and cook over low heat with the lid on until the mushrooms are soft and the house smells like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the blender ; this is the least poetic part of the preparation but unavoidable . The soup should end up with a slightly thick texture , like mud , with a perfume that makes you salivate and awakens other secretions of body and soul . I put on my best dress , paint my fingernails red , and serve the soup in warmed bowls , garnished with a dollop of the sour cream . <p> Per serving : 364 calories , 4 gm protein , 9 gm carbohydrates , 33 gm fat , 6 mg cholesterol , 7 gm saturated fat , 319 mg sodium <p> Noodles With Artichokes <p> ( 2 servings ) <p> Allende recommends this dish for reconstituting exhausted and ravenous lovers because it is saturated with aphrodisiacs .
