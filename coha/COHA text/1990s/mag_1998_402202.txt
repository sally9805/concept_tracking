A ROUNDTABLE ON DADDY HUNGER // Losing-or never having-a father may be a source of pain well into adulthood , but it does n't have to last forever . ESSENCE asked some of our wisest minds to help us find ways to move past the sense of loss and into our own strength . We brought together our Between Us columnist , Gwendolyn Goldsby Grant , Ed.D. , psychologist , sex counselor and author of The Best Kind of Loving : A Black Woman 's Guide to Finding Intimacy ( HarperPerennial ) ; our Feeling Good columnist Brenda Wade , Ph.D. , family psychologist , motivational speaker and coauthor of Love Lessons : A Guide to Transforming Relationships ( Amistad Press ) ; and Geoffrey Canada , president and CEO of New York City 's renowned Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families and author , most recently , of Reaching Up for Manhood ( Beacon Press ) . In this discussion , moderated by writer Diane Weathers and ESSENCE health editor Ziba Kashef , they show us the path that leads to healing the wounds . The Issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gwendolyn Goldsby Grant : You might as well call daddy hunger " skin hunger . " That absence causes a real need to have someone to be close to . There was a woman I interviewed for my book who said , " I needed a hug , Dr. Grant , and I got pregnant . " Half these little girls going around having sex really just needed a hug . Dr. Brenda Wade : The majority of the women I 've worked with who were abandoned by their fathers suffered from depression , anger , isolation or severe relationship disturbances . Yet they were capable in many cases of phenomenal success in terms of education and career . It 's quite striking . Geoffrey Canada : At Rheedlen we see the phenomenon of missing fathers so starkly in our work with young women . Many young girls have never had a relationship with a man . I worry that the first time some man says " I love you " to them or even acts affectionately , they 're going to do whatever that person wants because they 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed other patterns in women with absent fathers ? Wade : Half the women I referred to earlier have never had a viable relationship-and would n't let a man get close to them if you paid them a million dollars . They wear mean expressions on their faces to the point where you want to ask " What 's wrong ? " They 've learned that 's a defense to keep men away . Canada : Many of these women and girls have never experienced someone reaffirming who they are as people . When my daughter was a sophomore in high school , she was absolutely distraught because she could n't get dates with boys . We were having this long conversation , and I realized she did n't know whether she was attractive to men . I remember spending time convincing her , saying " No , honey , you are beautiful . " Girls do n't get that when there is n't a father present . Wade : Let 's not forget that a form of abandonment often takes place even when a father is present . He might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three jobs , or has an addictive illness or is emotionally shut down . ESSENCE : What specifically does a present , involved father give a girl that she ca n't get anywhere else ? Grant : She gets to mirror herself off someone who loves her and who is of the opposite sex , so then she wo n't need it from every man out there . Without that mirror , you may get yourself involved in sexual matters too soon . When that happens , you lose your ability to be a person who can make conscious choices . You 're allowing men to make those choices for you based on their assessment of you , not your assessment of yourself . Healing Ourselves ESSENCE : What can women do to be healed ? Wade : Any woman who has been abandoned physically or emotionally has a hole in her spirit that needs to be filled . You are either going to fill it with something unhealthy , or you 're going to fill it with self-love and the love of people you can count on-your friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Women also need to get information about their absent fathers . It 's very freeing for people to find out as much as they can about this mystery man . Where did he come from ? What happened to him ? Who was in his family ? What were his pains ? Why did he leave ? Canada : If your village right now is just your house , with you and your mother and maybe a couple of people you know , try to expand that to other folks who might be supportive . That could be in churches , social clubs . This puts our lives into a context . So many young people are growing up with no idea of how they connect within their families or within the larger world . Once they have a better understanding , the world makes a lot more sense to them . ESSENCE : What else can we do to heal ourselves and fill the hole that is left ? Wade : If the father can be found , it 's important to confront him either in person or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be found , then it needs to be done in what is called , in gestalt therapy , the hot seat . This is an exercise where you imagine him sitting in a chair opposite you and tell him what it was like growing up without a daddy . Confronting him in person or through a letter or exercise is something you would do with the help of a professional therapist or at least some kind of support group , because , while it 's very liberating , the emotional repercussions of a confrontation , whether real or imaginary , can be profound . It 's important to get the help you need to get the feelings out . They ca n't heal if they 're kept inside . Once they 're out , then the old thinking pattern can be broken . Instead of thinking , I 'm helpless , I 'm a victim , I 'm always going to be abandoned , you start to feel , I have some energy available now . I 'm not a victim ; I just got the feelings out ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where I fit in life , and I can choose a different path . Canada : The other thing you can do is be really overt with your story and your need for comfort . Wade : The only way through this loss is to express it , release it and grieve it . I ask people to do mourning rituals , where you might just sit and say , " I 'm going to mourn the loss of my father . I 'm going to sit here , and I 'm going to rock , I might cry , I might not cry , but I 'm mourning the fact that I did n't have a daddy . " Forgiveness is the end product of that long process . Most people say , " Oh , I 've forgiven him , " but they 've really kept all the feelings inside ; the anger 's still sitting there . The forgiveness is n't complete without the release and without the grieving . ESSENCE : How is one 's spiritual life important to this process ? Wade : It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned person without developing a strong spiritual core . Without that spiritual connection , there is always a sense of incompleteness . Mending Our Relationships ESSENCE : Can women who grew up in this situation have healthy relationships with men ? Wade : Many sisters look at a man as either somebody who 'll never ever live up to their fantasies or , conversely , somebody who sooner or later is going to abandon them just like Daddy . It 's easy to paint all men into that corner . But in The Road Less Traveled , M. Scott Peck , M.D. , says , " A woman who believes that men ca n't be trusted will never meet a man she can trust . " To combat those stereotypes , I suggest learning more about men . Read about them , talk to them . There are a couple of books I like : I Do n't Want to Talk About It ( Fireside ) by Terrence Real , which is about male depression , and A Man 's World : How Real Is Male Privilege and How High Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada : There are many guys who did not grow up in households with a stable relationship between the adults , so they have n't been able to figure out how adults relate to one another over time . As young women begin to share some of their own concerns and pain , they also have to be aware that they may be tapping into something in the men with whom they get involved . Wade : If a woman knows she 's talking to a man who may also have been abandoned , she should not be so quick to be sexually involved . If you discover he 's also abandoned-and we tend to look for somebody with our same issues so that we can heal them-then it 's possible to say , " We both have this loss in our backgrounds . I need to deal with it , and it seems to me that it would be a big mistake for me to get heavily involved with you , if neither of us has dealt with this . Now , would you like to work on this with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman have to look out for ? Wade : All too often a person who has been abandoned turns around and abandons herself . She 's not able to pay attention to her own needs . She does n't know how to get nurturing . She does n't even know when she needs it or that it 's important to be touched in a nonsexual way . Building Fatherhood ESSENCE : What should our goals as a community be about this issue ? Canada : In our communities , we have n't taught men what their role is when they 're not the traditional breadwinners . If you are n't that , what do you do ? We do n't know . Men generally are n't told that it 's critical and important that they learn how to love their children . We do n't CONTINUED ON PAGE 198 teach boys to do that or reinforce that kind of behavior . Instead we reward boys for macho strutting around . Then we wonder why these guys do n't have the sense of " That 's my child , I love this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it developed . ESSENCE : Give us one final piece of advice . Grant : You must think of yourself as the most precious person in the world . Remember : Your body is a temple-not condemned housing with a new tenant every month . Your house , your temple , is not abandoned . You live there . Love is n't something somebody brings you . Love is within you , and no one can ever take that away from you . No matter who comes , no matter who goes . Wade : Fatherless daughters must know that it is possible to heal after abandonment . You can transform that experience . I have seen so many women blossoming into full relationships , full creative and artistic and career success . People need to have that sense of hope . Sometimes you embark on that journey and think , Am I ever gon na get there ? Yeah , you will get there . It just takes a willingness to examine your life honestly . It takes persistence . It takes patience . <p>     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
