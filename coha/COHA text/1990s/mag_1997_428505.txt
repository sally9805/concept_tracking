Section : Culture &; ideas Los Angeles 's $1 billion cultural center hopes to play to the masses <p> Like a cultural El Nino , the $1 billion Getty Center opening in Los Angeles this week is being credited with everything from reviving civic architecture in a city with no center to providing a cure for Hollywood 's cultural inferiority complex . One local billionaire has already declared the Getty " too good " for Los Angeles . Others simply expect it to act that way , with its highbrow West-side address , mandatory parking reservations , and record-breaking price tag . The Getty even included a helicopter pad in its 110-acre site in the Santa Monica Mountains , overlooking the city . <p> But if this wealthiest of cultural institutions seems bent on doing all it can to accommodate the elite museum crowd , museum officials say great efforts also are being made to make the Getty accessible to the masses . At a time when museums and other arts institutions increasingly are being accused of alienating the broad communities they claim to serve , populism has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign  --  which promotes " Your Getty Center "  --  to the museum 's public facilities and ethnically diverse programs . " We have a lot of explaining to do , about what we are and what we will not be , " says Barry Munitz , who takes over in January as head of the $4.5 billion J. Paul Getty Trust , which includes the center 's museum , conservancy , and research institute . <p> Outreach . It may be tempting to dismiss this Getty-of-the-people approach as an elaborate public-relations move , but it is part of a larger national trend . Cultural institutions across the country , whether their motive is political correctness or a more urgent search for cash , are trying hard to find new ways to broaden their base beyond traditional museum visitors and theatergoers . Last fall , for instance , the $180 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center opened in a desolate and dangerous area of downtown Newark . Sunday afternoon family dance programs and music events are well attended by the black and Portuguese communities nearby . Washington , D.C. 's Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballet , every evening in its Millennium theater , events that draw a younger , more diverse crowd than does the center 's more formal programming . <p> Attendance has in fact been rising at large museums , thanks mostly to blockbuster shows and the growth of gift shops , restaurants , and other attractions that make art only a part of the experience . But a recent report by the National Endowment for the Arts said arts institutions today draw the same " highly skewed " audience they always have : They are older , less integrated , and richer than the general population . The NEA report laid the blame on the arts community itself : Artists , the report said , too often enshrine themselves  --  literally and figuratively  --  in temples out of reach of most Americans . <p> The Getty 's approach is based on more than a decade of audience research , focus groups , and pilot programs aimed at engineering an experience that is educational while painless enough to appeal to people who do n't normally go to museums . At the new museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van Gogh , Cezanne , Renoir , and others are beautiful in their simplicity and also small enough so that they never overwhelm . There are relaxing couches and chairs at every turn . And , most important , the claustrophobic atmosphere that characterizes so many museums has been completely designed away by Richard Meier , the celebrated New York architect behind the entire Getty project . Each gallery has an exit hallway that leads visitors outside , where they can get a breath of fresh air ( by L.A. standards ) , sip an iced cappuccino , or take in the spectacular vistas that stretch from the Pacific to the desert to the mountains to the skyscrapers of downtown L.A. <p> Throughout the five two-story pavilions housing the pre-20th-century collection of paintings , sculpture , antiquities , and decorative arts , there are information rooms packed with every conceivable educational aid . Samples of wood , gold leaf , and other materials used in the artworks are available for visitors to inspect . They also can learn about bronze-casting techniques , for instance , or attempt a marquetry puzzle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts in the gallery next door . There are interactive computer programs , time lines that put art objects into historical perspective , graphic panels identifying artistic styles and periods , and even a public graffiti space for sketching and writing . <p> Picture me . During their years at the Getty 's Malibu museum ( now closed for renovations ) , researchers discovered that parents often are reluctant to go to museums with their children  --  not because they fear the children will misbehave or be bored but because they might ask questions their parents ca n't answer . Yet children who visit art museums with their parents are much more likely to return : thus , the creation of the Family Room , an activity center where parents and children can get comfortable with the museum before they see it . In the game " Picture Yourself , " for example , children can dress up and pose in black lace like Goya 's Marquesa de Santiago or don great red robes like those worn by Angostino Pallavicini in his 17th-century portrait by Flemish artist Van Dyck . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their parents feel secure . <p> In addition to these attractions , the Getty offers a full calendar of special events  --  daytime , nighttime , for teenagers , children , and senior citizens . There are ethnic dancers and bilingual storytellers , guest lecturers and visiting scholars , weekend family festivals , and parent workshops . Admission is free ( parking is $5 ) , and many visitors will surely come just to see the place , sit by the fountains , wander the gardens  --  including the huge Central Garden , a work of art in its own right  --  or ride the gleaming tramway that runs ( or rather crawls ) from the parking lot to the top of the hill . " I would be very discouraged if the Getty became one of the largest tourist attractions in Los Angeles for all the wrong reasons , " says Richard Koshalek , director of L.A. 's Museum of Contemporary Art . " Art can sometimes be entertaining , but entertainment is very seldom art . " <p> Still elite ? Even if it were , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be enough to broaden its audience over the long haul . ( Not unexpectedly , early parking-reservation patterns for the museum read like a Top 10 list of L.A. 's whitest and wealthiest neighborhoods . ) To attract a wider audience , the Getty is relying on an outreach campaign , and on strengthening its ties with the Los Angeles community . Over the years , the Getty has invested its vast resources ( roughly $200 million a year ) into not only expanding its collection but developing long-term partnerships with local schools , community groups , and other art institutions throughout Los Angeles . <p> In recent weeks , schools , churches , and neighborhood groups have been papered with preparation kits and instructions on how to make group reservations at the Getty Center . Community organizers and educators were invited to tour the new six-building complex weeks ago , as well as join in the glittering pre-opening galas . Special events and parties have been hosted for the workers who built the Getty and their families . And Getty educators have dispersed all over Los Angeles  --  materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mar Vista Family Center in Los Angeles  --  one of the Getty 's longtime " community partners "  --  education specialist Elizabeth Escamilla recently gave teenagers a bit of perspective on how antiquities are relevant today . Using a " Got Milk ? " ad featuring Dennis Rodman , she pointed out how his pose and reference to the nectar of the gods were nothing more than a modern-day take on Statue of a Victorious Athlete , a fourth-century B.C. bronze now on display at the Getty . " They make the connection , " says Escamilla . <p> The Getty might not have had to work so hard to connect with Los Angeles if it had just built its museum closer to where most of Los Angeles lives , rather than high above the city 's most exclusive neighborhoods . One architecture critic called the complex " a gated community for art . " ( Two far more accessible sites were turned down early in the planning process . ) Limiting parking to 1,200 spaces , then requiring reservations , also reduced public access , even though public transportation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a much greater impact on the city had it spread its various institutes around , rather than group them together . Even Richard Meier 's widely acclaimed modern design of steel , glass , and Italian travertine ( the stone of ancient Rome ) has been knocked by some as too 21st century , too remote . <p> J. Paul Getty , the long-dead oil baron whose money made the new Getty possible , probably would have agreed . The old man abhorred things modern ( his museum overlooking the Pacific in Malibu was a re-creation of an ancient Roman villa ) . And Getty would have hated the cost even more than the design . He was an unregenerate tightwad who stayed in cheap motel rooms and made guests at his London home use a pay phone . Perhaps the only thing he liked less than spending his money was giving it to the IRS , which is why he left $700 million , the bulk of his estate , to his museum when he died in 1976 . Under the aegis of Harold M. Williams , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $4 billion , making the Getty the richest cultural institution in the world . <p> But while the Getty 's money has enabled it to acquire some of the world 's great art , fund projects all over the globe , and shun commercialism ( there will be no blockbuster shows at the new museum ) , it could do only so much to smooth the building process of the new Getty . The Hoover Dam was completed in less time than it took to draw up the plans for the Getty ( six years ) . By the time the center was finished , another seven-plus years had passed . Indeed , the history of the Getty 's 13 years of construction could fill a museum on its own . And it will . The museum 's story will be the first temporary exhibition in its new home . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The center 's special events and educational programs are designed to attract families . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : On a mountain ridge above Los Angeles 's toniest neighborhoods , the Getty includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pre-opening event , Cameron Mott , 5 , tries some art making of his own while his parents look on . <p> By Betsy Streisand <p>
