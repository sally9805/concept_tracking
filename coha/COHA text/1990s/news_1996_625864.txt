<p> CAMPAIGN 96/PRESIDENT/The choices will be hard <p> Sen. Bob Dole , R-Kan. , won in the Iowa caucuses and Pat Buchanan was a strong second . <p> It appears the religious right will be able to nail down tightly the anti-abortion plank in the Republican Party platform . <p> The choices in the presidential election are going to be very difficult for those who are pro-child , pro-family and pro-choice . <p> But then , we know from her best-selling book that first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is pro-child . <p> Also , President Clinton has co-opted former Vice President Dan Quayle 's preachments on family values and he is pro-choice . <p> One choice will be to vote for this pair of congenital liars who will promise lower taxes and less government and would go back to the left if elected . <p> The other is to vote for a Republican who would cut taxes and reduce the size of government , but is a religious descendant of those in Salem who would hang all witches . <p> Ford A. Bankston , Houston <p> Viewing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelley for witnessing the execution of Leo Jenkins , who murdered two of her beautiful children ? ( " " Do not view executions , " Viewpoints , Feb. 13 ) . <p> Since I am the mother of a murdered child ( my only ) and a friend of the Kelley family , defending this new right of victims to witness in Texas is easy . <p> Recent surveys show that 93 percent of the people support this right . Those polled state that they would exercise this option if their loved ones were murdered . <p> Make no mistake , the Kelleys ' lives can and never will be as they were before this brutal loss , but I will say that the closure they and all victims must have is now in place . <p> We , the victims of violent crime in Texas , are beginning to see that our rights are just as important as the criminals ' rights , as it should be . <p> Just think about it . . . we are having to fight for ours . <p> Lee Wells Flowers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very easy to present tax plans like the flat tax so that they appeal to everyone . The details and ramifications are so complicated that incorrect projections are hard to refute . I am sure there are detailed computer models of the U.S.economy that could be used to analyze the proposals . <p> This would be a great project for Ross Perot . He would understand the computer model , have the funds to bring the data to the people and be able to present it on charts we could understand . <p> Parrish Hirasaki , Dickinson <p> GOP hurt by albatross <p> " " Pro-choice albatross ? " I refer to John C.Gallagher 's Feb. 12 letter . <p> This shows how perspective is a funny thing . It seems to me that the party with the albatross around its neck is not the Democratic Party , but the Republican Party . <p> And the name of the albatross is not " " pro-choice , " but " " pro-life . " <p> The pro-life movement led to the downfall of the Republican Party in the 1992 presidential election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defeat again in 1996 . <p> The party that this issue has damaged is the Republican . And I , for one , could not be happier . <p> Ray Stelly , Houston <p> President does n't get it <p> So President Clinton considers discharge of military personnel who are HIV positive an " " abomination . " <p> As a man who actively avoided military service , he just does n't get it . Military service can mean living and working with other personnel in circumstances that are virtually intimate . HIV is both communicable and invariably fatal . If I were a soldier , I would most definitely not wish to share a foxhole with someone so infected . <p> One suspects that Clinton is again playing fast and loose with an issue that can translate into life and death for someone else . The administration 's attitude toward HIV and AIDS can be seen as political posturing at its worst . <p> If the disease in question were tuberculosis , the question would not have arisen . The attitude toward AIDS is quite clearly a litmus test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearest indication of his contempt both for traditional values and common sense . <p> Ca n't we send this man back to Arkansas in November ? <p> Philip M.Giraldi , The Woodlands <p> Taiwan free from China <p> Regarding Weili Yang 's Feb. 11 letter , " " Reunification of China " : <p> Taiwan has been separated from China for more than 100 years , and 85 percent of Taiwan 's residents have settled there so long that they have planted their roots in Taiwan . Most of the Taiwanese are not enthusiastic with the policy of " " reunification " set by the Kuomintang Party ( KMT ) which has controlled Taiwan for 50 years by means of oppression . <p> Despite the fact that " " over 50 percent of the respondents from a recent poll favored the status quo , " it does not mean they favor the policy of reunification . The Taiwanese have started to voice their concerns about their future . They want Taiwan to be an independent country and free from China . <p> Cheng Y.Chuang , president , Houston chapter , Formosan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only way to resolve the problem with the rodeo scholarships is to eliminate race- or ethnic-based scholarships entirely . <p> Can you imagine the outrage if the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo gave out scholarships that were for white kids only ? <p> And what 's with this Johnny Mata and L.U.L.A.C. protesting darn near everything ( Chronicle , Feb. 11 ) ? If they care so much about Hispanics , why are n't they down in Mexico trying to straighten out that cesspool of a country so people do n't have to risk their lives to come here ? <p> Gregg Steven , Richmond <p> Be cautious about bill <p> Thanks for Edwin Yoder 's Feb. 7 column , " " Where new act will lead us is nebulous " : <p> Finally , here is someone who has been able to concisely and clearly express my own doubts regarding the recent passage of the new telecommunications package . <p> Eager to see new laws enacted with less bureaucracy , I 'm doubtful if we can trust " " media moguls with a mania for mergers and acquisitions " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a say or choice will we , the consumer , have once all the grabbing and fighting have been settled and the big communications giants have decided themselves the way to divide the huge information highway pie ? Whose interests are really protected here ? <p> Like Yoder , I also say let 's be cautious and see where this new act is taking us . Let 's hope we 'll have the power to restrain the big telecommunications giants ' appetite and still have a way to smooth out the kinks as they appear . <p> Nora Alden , Houston <p> Look beyond the cliches <p> When will Chronicle writers like Nancy Mathis look beyond the cliches for an understanding of the 1994 elections ? <p> Her Feb. 9 Page One story on the two political parties paying heed to the force of women starts from a baseless notion of " " angry white males " being responsible for the GOP wins in November , 1994 . Many , many women - both informed and concerned but certainly not angry - took steps to correct what we perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of a Democratic president and Democratically controlled Congress . <p> I worked with hundreds of these nonangry but well-informed women - and men - to bring out the Republican vote in 1994 . <p> Sheryl Berg , Republican precinct chairman , Pct. 92 and chairman , Clear Lake Victory ' 94 phone bank .
