<p> The Olympic stage is always full of drama , a place where heartwarming moments are unrehearsed , yet delivered with stunning eloquence . <p> There are tales of triumph and tragedy and stories of rabid determination that take precedence over outcome . And , at their best , the Olympics make us feel good about our country and about ourselves . <p> The 1996 Olympics in Atlanta are only 250 days away and surely will provide more chapters to a history rich in memories . <p> Here 's a look back at our country 's 10 most memorable moments in the history of the Summer Games . <p> 1 . Jesse Owens : The son of sharecroppers and grandson of slaves , Owens became an international hero for his performance at the 1936 Games in Berlin . <p> Amid Nazi propaganda that portrayed black men as inferior , Owens captured gold medals in the 100-meter dash , 200-meter dash and long jump and as a member of the 4x100-meter relay team . <p> Owens set Olympic records in the 200 ( 20.7 ) and the long jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time of 39.8 seconds stood as a world record for 20 years . He emerged as an unlikely favorite of the German masses and was embraced by German competitor Luz Long in full view of Adolf Hitler after his record-setting leap in the long jump . <p> Although he returned to a ticker-tape parade , Owens ' career was reduced to racing against horses , dogs and motorcycles . But his stunning performance in Berlin crossed racial and ethnic barriers and provided a brief moment of unity in times of turbulence . <p> 2 . Mark Spitz : After a disappointing performance at the 1968 Games in Mexico City , Spitz arrived in Munich in 1972 with the agenda of becoming the first athlete in any sport to win six gold medals in a single Olympics . <p> Spitz did even better by winning seven golds in swimming . He set world records in all four of his individual disciplines and in two of the three relay races . And he atoned for significant embarrassment . <p> In 1967 , Spitz won five gold medals at the Pan-American Games and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he won only two gold medals at the 1968 Games and carried the burden for four years . <p> 3 . Wilma Rudolph : One of 22 children , Rudolph weighed only 4 1/2 pounds at birth and endured a traumatic childhood that included bouts with polio and scarlet fever . The latter caused her to lose the use of her left leg , and Rudolph began wearing a cumbersome brace at age 6 . <p> But in an amazing story of perseverance , Rudolph became a track star by the age of 16 and completed her personal triumph four years later . <p> At the 1960 Games in Rome , Rudolph won gold medals in the 100- and 200-meter dash and as a member of the 4x100-meter relay team . <p> 4 . Bob Beamon : It is known simply as " the perfect jump , " one that sent Beamon into an apoplectic seizure in the aftermath of his stunning accomplishment . <p> One foul away from elimination , Beamon raced down the runway at the 1968 Games in Mexico City and jumped into history by leaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nearly 22 inches . <p> After the jump , fellow competitor Lynn Davies looked at Beamon and said , " You have destroyed this event . " <p> Suddenly aware of what he had done , Beamon collapsed , overcome with nausea and tears . <p> Although many were suspicious about the wind readings ( they were measured exactly at the legal limit ) , Beamon 's feat was hailed as the greatest athletic achievement in history . In the 33 years since Owens had jumped a world-record 26-8 1/4 in 1935 , the mark had been advanced only 8 1/2 inches . In one moment , Beamon added another 21 3/4 inches . <p> 5 . Jim Thorpe : In 1950 , Thorpe was voted the best athlete for the first half of the century , and it 's easy to see why . <p> An All-America halfback at Carlisle in 1911 and 1912 , Thorpe also excelled at track and was chosen to the U.S. Olympic team in 1912 . In Stockholm , Thorpe won the pentathlon , took fourth in the high jump and finished seventh in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never competing in the event and throwing a javelin for the first time only two months before , Thorpe dominated the event and won with a world-record 8,412 points . The performance was so good that it would have earned him a silver medal at the 1948 Olympics . <p> The King of Sweden made a presentation to Thorpe , calling him the " greatest athlete in the world . " <p> " Thanks , King , " was Thorpe 's famous response . <p> It was learned a year later , however , that Thorpe had earned $ 25 a week playing minor-league baseball in 1909 and 1910 . The Amateur Athletic Union came down hard on Thorpe , demanding his medals back and striking his name from the record books . <p> In 1983 , 30 years after Thorpe 's death , his medals were returned to his children and his name reinstated in the record books . <p> 6 . Greg Louganis : In a moment that made the sporting world shudder , Louganis bashed his head on the board on a reverse dive during the preliminary round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the pool and required stitches . <p> Yet in a dramatic show of courage that was a defining moment of the 1988 Games in Seoul , South Korea , Louganis returned later that day for his last three dives and qualified for the finals . The next day , he easily won the gold in the springboard event to become the first man to sweep both diving medals ( springboard and platform ) in two consecutive Olympics . <p> Louganis since has revealed he tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS in March , 1988 , before the Seoul Games . <p> 7 . Billy Mills : During the two weeks he spent in the Olympic Village , Mills had n't been asked a single question . After a stunning upset in the 10,000-meter race at the 1964 Games in Tokyo , that changed in a hurry . <p> Mills , a Sioux Indian born in South Dakota and orphaned at 13 , shocked the field with a final sprint in the homestretch . He won by three yards before a roaring crowd of 75,000 . <p> Just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break free from the congested pack and shoved Mills , who went staggering to the outside of the track . That set up Mills ' dramatic kick to the finish line . <p> Mills ' time of 28:24.4 was an Olympic record and 46 seconds faster than his previous personal best . <p> 8 . The 1984 Games : When the Olympics came to Los Angeles in 1984 , there were many question marks . Could the United States successfully host the Summer Games ? After all , the country had n't done so since 1932 . Could the Games be a success despite a boycott by the Soviet bloc ? <p> And after the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Games in Moscow , was America committed enough to its Olympic effort ? The answer was resounding and emphatic . Not only were the Games a tremendous financial success , they turned into a big party , American-style . <p> The United States won 174 medals , including 83 golds . There were superb individual performances from Carl Lewis , who won the gold in the long jump , 100 meters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by Pernell Whitaker , Tyrell Biggs and Mark Breland , won nine golds , two silvers and one bronze . In gymnastics , Bart Conner won two gold medals and Mary Lou Retton captured our hearts like Olga Korbut and Nadia Comaneci had done in earlier Olympics . And the men 's basketball team , which was led by Michael Jordan , also won the gold . <p> 9 . The Dream Team : Some complained it ruined the marriage of the Olympics and amateur athletes . Others said it was an exercise of American muscle showing up the competition . <p> But there never has been a collection of talent like the Dream Team , which won the gold medal at the 1992 Games in Barcelona , Spain , by destroying the competition by nearly 43 points per game . <p> With stars such as Michael Jordan , Magic Johnson , Scottie Pippen , Larry Bird and Charles Barkley , the United States won the gold medal by smothering Croatia 117-85 in the finals . But it was the stirring victory ceremony that put an indelible mark on Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American flag over the Reebok logo on his warmup jersey . Team members exchanged embraces with the Lithuanian contingent . And all of the ambivalence these millionaire athletes once displayed about the competition disappeared into genuine patriotism . <p> Johnson called it the greatest triumph of his career , while Jordan said he never had felt more proud to be an American . <p> 10 . Florence Griffith Joyner : At the 1988 Games in Seoul , " Flo-Jo " turned the spotlight to women 's track and field and established herself as the fastest woman in the world . <p> With long fingernails and tresses ( and without the flashy bodysuits she wore at the U.S. Olympic trials ) , Griffith Joyner won three golds and one silver . She won the 100-meter dash , set a world record in the 200 meters that still exists , and her time in the 100 ( 10.54 ) would have earned a bronze medal in the 1956 men 's event . <p> Besides outshining her talented sister-in-law , Jackie Joyner-Kersee , Griffith Joyner also helped the 400-meter relay team take gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and American record . @x A couple of times each month something stirs in my heart , and I know the only way to quiet the churning is to attend Mass . Once I 'm there , however , I stare at the guy hanging on the wall and think , " What in the world am I doing here ? " You see , I was raised in a middle-of-the-road Protestant church , no crucifixes in sight . Nevertheless , in my 20s and 30s , I ended up volunteering with the Catholic Church both in Latin America and the United States . Occasionally , to my chagrin , I toyed with the idea of spurning my Protestant prejudice and embracing Catholicism completely . In Latin America I attended Mass sporadically , watching the proceedings as an outsider , a tourist . One time , though , in a moment of clarity , I understood . I saw the priest hold the host aloft as I had before , but this time when I heard it crack and watched it break into pieces , I knew I had found an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and in my visits in the barrios - the snapping and shattering of people 's fragile lives summed up in one thin wafer . My mind whirled in stunned confusion , and I went forward to receive Communion ( illegally , of course ! ) because I yearned to be a part of whatever was happening in that place . At the same time I recognized the weighty responsibility participation placed on me - all of us sitting in those pews had to put that wafer back together again . There was no other way . And compassion was the glue . It did n't matter if we came from Los Leones , where two-story houses were surrounded by lush gardens and high stucco walls , or if we were from a one-room tin shack in La Lucha ; we were the Body of Christ- a living , breathing entity in this world at this moment . I wanted to dance down the aisles , shouting , " 1 get it ! I get it ! " Later , however , I successfully subdued the yearning and stuck with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charities and in the Catholic Worker movement introduced me to Jesus ' radical compassion . Over the years the church 's compassion-based social justice teachings filtered into my unconscious like layers of dust . I never felt the settling until I lived several years without the church in my life . I missed being immersed in these teachings ; I missed the Eucharist . So , after 19 years of thoughtful consideration , I became a bona fide member of the Roman Catholic Church . Consequently , here I am , a part of something I do n't quite understand and probably never will . I wonder if other nascent Catholics have had some of my traumatic experiences . Do others feel insecure and conspicuous ? I usually sit in the back so no one can spot my fumbling . Once I made the unfortunate mistake of being the last one in line to receive Communion . There was nothing inherently wrong with this except that the man in front of me was 6 foot 5 and just as broad . This would n't have been so had if the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall man stepped aside and I stepped forward , my open hand outstretched in supplication , I was staring at the back of the short man , who thinking he had served the last parishioner , was sprinting for the altar . Perhaps a seasoned Catholic would have weathered this well , perhaps one comfortable in the church would have called out , " Hey , Father , what about me ? " But I stood frozen , feeling everyone 's eyes heating up my backside ; my outstretched hand begging for a simple piece of bread . " Okey , dokey , " I thought , and turned away from my spiritual sustenance , away from God , rejected at last . In my heart the funeral bell tolled . The jig was up . The whole church saw the truth laid bare- she 's a fraud ! She was n't born a Catholic . She never learned the Baltimore Catechism . And worse , God was saying , " Get out , you of little faith ! What are you doing here ? " I turned , smiling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halfway down the aisle several parishioners pointed behind me , so I turned and here came Father apologizing profusely . I- gratefully , humbly , " Oh , thank you , God " - consumed Jesus on the spot , received the grace I had come for , and returned to my seat . I can cross myself with ease now , but I mumble the prayers hoping no one notices that I do n't know them . ( Neon light flashing over my head , arrow pointing down - " She 's not genuine ! " ) Part of the problem is that I attend services both in Spanish and English , so I know parts of the Mass in both languages . I have the " and also with you " down , which is n't saying much , since it 's only four words in Spanish or English . I say the " amens " quietly in case I interject them at the wrong time . I do n't even attempt the Creed , but let it slide into my soul through my ears . Because of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Catholics break it up near the end , and it feels weird not to just jog right into " For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever . " Wait , wait , I caution myself , until the priest says his part . Then I get to say the last line and feel like I have completed something . Did n't I learn the prayers in RCIA classes , you ask ? No , I never went to classes . When I finally decided to join the church , I called an older priest friend for advice since he knew of my rebellious and doubting spirit . He said , " Find an old priest , the young ones are too conservative . " I lucked out - the priest in our town was nearing retirement . I was going to be in Mexico when the classes would take place , so instead , he and I met several times . He brushed aside my fears of not knowing the prayers and the outward signs of belief and said they would come in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the significance of the Eucharist , and the meaning of life . I loved it . I consumed several excellent books by Ronald Roiheiser , O.M.I. , that convinced me that I was making the right choice . I asked the priest three times about my non-traditional thoughts , and three times he stretched out his arms and said , " The church is like a big umbrella , sheltering all different kinds of Catholics , liberal and conservative , the questioning and the certain . The church needs us all . You 'll be fine . " Several months after I was confirmed , I visited a North American priest friend who had worked in my town in Latin America . We had had lively , heated discussions in the past concerning birth control , homosexuality , and other hot topics . When we started up again , I reminded him that I was now a part of the church . " You 're no Catholic ! " he bellowed . " Ha ! " I cried back . " I am , I am , I am . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , we 'll have to work on you . " I am , I am , I am a groping , confused neophyte , wondering what in the heck I 've gone and done , but I did it , and God is working on me . At every Mass , my prayers start with , " OK , God , here I am , now what ? " A friend of mine says of prayer and meditation , " Just show up . It 's the being with the Being that matters . " And so I show up because there 's something here I crave . At every Mass I say , " Just say the word , and I shall be healed . " At every Mass I say , " Lamb of God , you take away the sins of the world . " At every Mass I gaze at the Christ , a perfect circle , broken into pieces , as he was broken , as his people are broken , and then we eat him . Even I get the profound privilege of consuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be one . Then we , a changed people , touched by something unnameable , are charged to go in peace . As I walk to my car , I contemplate this responsibility placed on me : To leave this place of reflection where it is easy to be aware of God and to practice peace in a broken world . " Oh Jesus , help , " I say . I am never sure when I wander in and awkwardly genuflect and find a place on the pew what will happen . But I always know when I leave that I am different , that because of this hour in my life , because I heard the words and said the words and prayed the words and then welcomed Jesus into my life one more time , I am different . I am no shining star of the church . I do n't volunteer at the fish fry ; I do n't give much money ; I am not a paragon of Catholic morality in the wider world . My theology is skewed from ignorance and stubbornness . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . But here I am , God , here I am.
