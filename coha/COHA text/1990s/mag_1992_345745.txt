Short , chunky and menacingly combative , Harvey Myerson is one of the country 's most talented trial lawyers . But according to charges that will be heard in Brooklyn 's federal courthouse next week , he is also one of the most tainted . After building a reputation representing the likes of Donald Trump , Shearson Lehman and former Treasury Secretary William Simon , Myerson stands accused of swindling $3.5 million from clients and partners and faces as much as 20 years in prison . Said prosecutor Sean O'Shea after the initial indictment last year : " We have here an unprecedented pattern of greed and dishonesty by a lawyer at the top of his profession . " <P> For Myerson , 52 , the charges signal a precipitous fall from grace . And as in Greek tragedy , his fate seems the result of a fundamental character flaw . Despite a hefty draw of $1.4 million from his $400-an-hour rate at the prestigious New York law firm of Myerson &; Kuhn , Myerson 's profligate life- style  --  featuring Ferraris and Rolls-Royces , five homes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more . In 1988 , for example , Myerson took family members on a chartered-jet vacation to Maine  --  and allegedly billed client Shearson Lehman ( without the firm 's knowledge ) for the trip . <P> But Myerson apparently saved his best treats for a string of mistresses . In 1989 a top New York model joined him at the Kentucky Derby . According to the indictment , clients Kelley Oil and ICN Pharmaceuticals picked up the tab . Another model received an $86,000 Cartier ring and a $24,000 full-length mink , courtesy of Myerson 's unsuspecting law partners . To attract prospective lovers , sources say , Myerson liked to pose as a movie producer and " audition " young agency models in his office . " To Myerson , there is just no distinction between persuading a jury and persuading his wife or clients or partners of something , " says a former partner . <P> In the courtroom , Myerson has been a master at proving deception in others , regularly badgering witnesses into submission and throwing himself shamelessly at juries . " Please God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged jurors at the 1986 conclusion of his most famous case , an antitrust action brought by the upstart U.S. Football League against the monopolistic practices of the National Football League . Myerson and the U.S.F.L. won  --  but they received a humiliating $3 in damages and the lesson that even courtroom victories are no guarantee of riches . <P> The son of a Philadelphia silk wholesaler , Myerson made his mark in the 1970s at the venerable New York law firm of Webster &; Sheffield . But his craving for power and wealth caused constant friction with partners , many of whom were relieved when Myerson was wooed away in 1984 by Finley , Kumble , an aggressive 700-lawyer firm that became synonymous with ' 80s-style greed .
