<p> A pop quiz for the start of the new school year : Take the highest number of students that ever attended United States schools ( 52.7 million ) . Add the lowest unemployment rate in 27 years . Factor in new laws mandating reduced class sizes . Question : Where will the schools find the teachers they need to fill this fall 's classrooms ? In New York City , new math and science teachers are coming from Austria and bilingual teachers from Spain . Mississippi is offering a free college education to students who commit to teaching in districts with critical shortages . Texas and California are making teachers out of ex-aerospace engineers and volunteer parents . Teacher recruitment used to be a bland business , involving the usual prospects from local teachers colleges . To be local was good ; to be known was better . " School districts historically have not been very creative in the ways they go about recruiting teachers , " says Emily Feistritzer , of the Washington-based National Center for Education Information . But this year the annual scramble for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routines . Schools are looking further afield and tapping into a deeper pool of applicants than ever before . The realities of finding teachers in a tight labor market , however , could lower standards in tough-to-staff districts . In response to such pressures , Kentucky is allowing five districts to hire substitutes who have only a high school diploma , " as a last resort , " Kentucky officials say . New York stayed ahead of the hiring game to avoid a repeat of last year 's fiasco , when 3,000 teaching posts remained vacant the week before schools opened . This time , school administrators tried new recruiting strategies , including importing 24 math and science teachers from Austria and seven Spanish teachers from Spain . " We were the first US school system to recruit in Austria , " says Gary Barton , the administrator in charge of teacher hiring for the New York City Board of Education . " We received applications from over 100 qualified applicants , " says Mr. Barton . Interviews were done by teleconferencing . The new recruits are temporarily housed in dorms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . They 've also had tours of the city , crash courses in New York culture at City College , and help in setting up bank accounts . " We did n't want 100 people the first time . We could have had problems with such a large group . We wanted to start small and build on this , " he adds . New York hired 7,500 teachers last year , and 5,000 this year . The city estimates it will need yet another 30,000 new teachers over the next five years . Math , science , and Spanish are the posts most difficult to fill . For next year , Barton says he already has his eye on Switzerland and Scotland , in addition to Austria . All three countries have healthy reserves of qualified teachers , a number of whom have indicated interest in working in the US . The city is also stepping up recruiting efforts in Massachusetts and Puerto Rico . In addition , the Board of Education set up satellite recruitment offices to ease hiring in 11 of the city 's poorest districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better applicant pool has been the difficulty of navigating the recruitment process . There 's often a battery of tests , prescribed courses , and a formidable bureaucracy . Applications may go astray , phone calls are n't answered , and hiring decisions frequently come down to the wire . " Districts wait until the last minute to hire , so you have schools all over the country that open with vacancies , " says Ms. Feistritzer . " It 's a very inefficient way and a very unprofessional way to do business , but it 's been going on for years . " Marjorie Adler , the Philadelphia School District 's human-resources director , says that " people experience our hiring process as frustrating and cumbersome . They get distracted and go elsewhere . " She is setting up a new information system to track applicants who may be a year from a job decision , " so they do n't go away feeling that no one ever cared about them , " she adds . The city 's new approach is already showing results . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening day of school . By historic standards of shortage , that 's small about 100 teachers - but not if it 's your kid 's kindergarten teacher , " she adds . Boston is also tackling an antiquated recruitment process . Last year , the city set up a computerized database of teacher candidates , held its first-ever teacher fair , and began offering job guarantees to top student teachers . It also expanded advertising in newspapers across the country and completely reworked its recruitment literature . " We 've redone the entire process , " says Karen Cahill , director of recruitment for the Boston Public Schools . " Before , nobody knew if there was a rhyme or reason to whether we called someone back for an interview . Now we have a strong process . " With an eye to the future , state lawmakers in July approved $ 20,000 bonuses , over four years , to recruit top teachers . About 40 percent of the state 's 70,000 teachers will turn over in the next decade . <p> Big states , smaller classes But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as California and Texas , that are on the front lines of the drive for new teachers . They 've already rejigged the system , purchased the ads , and boosted the incentives . Now , the push is to attract new people . Since California passed class-size reduction legislation three years ago , the number of teachers teaching on emergency permits has jumped to more than 18,000 . Often , these teachers wind up teaching the toughest classes in the poorest schools , with little support . " About two-thirds of those who began teaching on an emergency permit never got a permanent credential . It 's a revolving door and a waste of resources , " says Michael McKibbin , who directs an $ 11 million **25;574;TOOLONG program for the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing . " But we found that if we provide them with a solid program that makes sense , if we give them a teacher to serve as a mentor and help them , and not just put them in the coldest classroom in the corner with no supplies , they stay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some 6,000 teaching interns have gone through this program in the last three years . Most came into the program from a second career . This year , California is expanding its program to include those who need even more training and course work to achieve full certification . These " pre-interns " will also be provided training and mentoring as they teach full time in California classrooms . " We 've got architects , lawyers , doctors , and even a missionary , " says Joan Sellers , who directs the intern program for the West Contra Costa Unified School District , in Richmond , Calif . " The first question we ask these candidates is why they decided to go back into teaching at this point in their life . Many tell us that they chose their first profession for the money , but found that what you look for at 20 is not so satisfying at 40 , " she adds . In Texas , the teacher crunch has set off a frenzy of incentives and alternative-training programs to attract and keep qualified teachers , especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signing incentive . " I 've been here 22 years , and we 've never been fully staffed , " says Loretta Simon , spokeswoman for the Dallas Independent School District . For the most part , the city has matched the growing student population - 2,500 new students each year - with more teachers and schools . But this year , the district is still about 185 teachers short of its full 9,800-teacher quota , she adds . In most big cities in Texas , Hispanics make up the majority of the student population , but more than 2 of 3 teachers are Anglo . " The greatest need is in the lower grades , " says Jo Nell Drayden , manager of staffing and recruitment for the Houston Independent School District . " When the language in the home is Spanish , then the child grows up speaking Spanish , and they wo n't get much English until they get to school . We need to be prepared to meet the needs of those kids . " In addition to raising teacher salaries , Houston has created what Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated Hispanics and other professionals into the teaching profession . More than 26 Texas school districts have set up **28;601;TOOLONG programs that are bringing more minorities and mid-career professionals into teaching . " These are not quick-and-dirty programs ; data show that these people are as good as or better than people coming through traditional programs , " says Feistritzer , who conducts annual surveys of **25;631;TOOLONG programs . In both California and Texas , officials hope that this new strategy will provide a steady source of qualified new teachers . " We see these people as naturals to be teachers if we provide them the career ladder to get there , " says Mr. McKibbin . <p> * Staff writers Scott Baldauf , Marjorie Coeyman , and Mark Clayton contributed to this report .
