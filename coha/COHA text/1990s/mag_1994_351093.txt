( WHEN STEVE ROSS , NEAR death with cancer , checked into a Los Angeles hospital in late 1992 , he registered as George Bailey , the self-sacrificing common-man hero of Frank Capra 's It 's a Wonderful Life . No doubt that was how the man who masterminded the merger of Time Inc. ( which owns TIME ) and Warner Communications wished to be perceived . But the Steve Ross who emerges in Master of the Game ( Simon &; Schuster ; 395 pages ; $25 ) , New Yorker staff writer Connie Bruck 's intelligent and fascinating biography , is composed equally of George Bailey , Don Corleone , Felix Krull and Oskar Schindler  --  Steven Spielberg has said Ross was a model for the portrayal of Schindler in Schindler 's List . <P> Born in Brooklyn in 1927 to a once affluent Jewish family that lost everything in the Depression , Ross was a young opportunist without an opportunity until he married a woman whose father owned a string of funeral parlors . Within a few years , Ross expanded the company 's businesses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1967 Ross acquired a powerful talent agency , and two years later , he bought the faltering Warner Bros. studio . <P> As Bruck amply demonstrates , Ross 's charm made him a natural for Hollywood , where everyone is a vortex of ego and where success belongs not to those who count the beans but to those who extravagantly spoil the stars . If Barbra Streisand wanted a painting , why not buy it for her ? If Dustin Hoffman was vacationing in Europe , why not provide him with a yacht ? If Steven Spielberg was looking for a home in the Hamptons , why not arrange the sale for him ? " It 's about people , really  --  realizing what they want , " Ross once told Bruck . <P> With Ross expertly stroking egos , Warner prospered astonishingly , but his highly personal , unbusinesslike style had its darker side . Bruck provides the most detailed account yet of an illegal cash-skimming operation at the Mob-run Westchester Premier Theater in the 1970s . Ross 's best friend , Warner executive Jay Emmett , pleaded guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bruck leaves the unmistakable impression that Ross himself was deeply involved , which Ross steadfastly denied . ( Ross cut off Emmett summarily when Emmett began cooperating with the prosecution . ) <P> The silver-tongued Ross always extricated himself from dicey situations and moved on to the next play in a bigger game . The 1989 merger of Time Inc. and Warner was his triumph . Personally , he reaped $193 million in stock from the deal , and while , technically , Time was acquiring Warner , and Ross and Time chief Nick Nicholas were to be co-CEOs , Ross quietly maneuvered himself into supremacy by dazzling the board with promises of a rich future . He then orchestrated a coup in which the directors ousted Nicholas . <P> The only thing Ross could n't wheedle to his own advantage was cancer . On his deathbed , unable to ply his wiles , he was superseded at Time Warner by Gerald Levin . Superseded but not replaced . Ross was the inimitable master of the art of seduction . From Spielberg to the Time Inc. board , he convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really George Bailey .
