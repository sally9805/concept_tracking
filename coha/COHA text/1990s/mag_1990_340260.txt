Television is one of those peculiar institutions ( professional sports is another ) where the underlings often wield more clout than their bosses . The faces onscreen , after all , are what count for the audience , not the faceless executives who ostensibly hire and fire them . David Burke , president of CBS News , found that out the hard way , when he suspended 60 Minutes commentator Andy Rooney last month for allegedly making offensive remarks about blacks and homosexuals . The uproar over the suspension was instant and unrelenting . Thousands of complaints from viewers poured in to CBS . Press critics chided the network for trampling on Rooney 's free-speech rights . CBS colleagues , most notably 60 Minutes executive producer Don Hewitt , lobbied on Rooney 's behalf . <P> Last week the boss capitulated . With just three weeks of the three-month suspension completed , Burke reinstated Rooney . " Painful though these events have been , " said Burke in a press release , " we have all learned a great deal about how sensitive and fragile our society is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt if great care is not taken in conducting public discourse . " Rooney was back on the air Sunday night with a comment about the controversy . <P> Rooney 's troubles stemmed from remarks attributed to him in a gay magazine , The Advocate . He was quoted as saying that blacks had " watered down their genes because the less intelligent ones are the ones that have the most children . " In a letter published in the same issue , Rooney expressed his distaste for homosexuality in blunt and ill-informed terms . Rooney denied making the racist remarks . But insiders say it was the letter  --  which was sent without Burke 's approval  --  that was most responsible for the suspension . <P> The campaign for Rooney 's reinstatement was fierce . Hewitt even posted a memo at CBS headquarters blaming a dip in 60 Minutes ' ratings on Rooney 's absence . A much more important factor : last week ABC scheduled the hit show America 's Funniest Home Videos opposite it . Though Burke did not elaborate on the reasons for his change of heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preponderance of public opinion . " Says he : " It took a lot of courage to do what ( ( Burke 's ) ) done . " <P> Burke may need more than courage to survive in his increasingly hazardous job . Rumors swirled last week that the CBS News chief , who was named to the position in August 1988 after eleven years at ABC , was about to resign . In the corridors of CBS News , Burke was criticized not only for his handling of the Rooney affair but also for his aloof and uncommunicative management style . ( Burke , head of one of the nation 's leading news organizations , routinely turns down all press interviews . ) He is also under pressure to reverse the ratings slide of the CBS Evening News . Yet CBS sources last week discounted reports that Burke 's job was in jeopardy . CBS Broadcast Group chief Howard Stringer praised Burke for dealing with " a delicate and complicated issue with thoughtfulness and strength . He has my and this company 's full support .
