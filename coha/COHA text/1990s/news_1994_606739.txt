<p> Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson was very nearly called home Friday morning as he headed toward the organization 's fourth annual conference . <p> Soon after takeoff from his base in Norfolk , Robertson 's plane blew a hydraulic valve , according to coalition spokesman Mike Russell . " It was everything the pilot could do to get the plane back to the ground safely , " Russell said . <p> The religious broadcaster was saved , so to speak . He got another plane and winged his way to the Washington Hilton in plenty of time to inspire the 3,000 coalition members who had come from all over the country to share prayers and strategies for the political battles to come . <p> Perhaps Robertson was chastened by the experience , but that did n't stop him from telling the crowd that " God intends it to be ... one of the most powerful political forces " in the country 's history . Nonetheless , the coalition is presenting itself in more low-key terms these days , hoping to attract with honey what it could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fiery crowd , whooping and hollering at the drop of a " Joycelyn Elders . " So many struggles to wage  --  against socialized medicine , the pork-barrel crime bill and public schools with too much teaching of evolution and not enough prayer . And the Christian Coalition 's burden grows heavier every minute that the Clinton administration stays in power . <p> " The coalition was known for the so-called below-the-belt issues , " said coalition member and Baltimore attorney William Hall during a break between sessions . " They were opposing homosexuality , abortion , radical feminism . Now it 's a much broader group . " And a more pragmatic one too . The talk was of grass-roots campaigns , voter registration , party politics . Amy Dencklaw came with her sister because they 're " sick and tired of the way the liberals are running the country . " At home in Fort Dodge , Iowa , she added , " we got a lot of people that are wanting us to come back and recharge their batteries . " <p> Patty Gascoyne , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trip with her 3-month-old son , Simeon , because she wants to teach him and her other three children " what their duty is as little citizens . " <p> On her shirt she wore a nickel pasted on scraps of red , white and blue fabric  --  a reminder , she said , of former Arkansas state employee Larry Nichols . " He has 40 boxes of documentation about Bill Clinton dealing with cocaine and money laundering , " Gascoyne said . <p> As the coalition strives to control the House , the Senate and the White House , it is trying to infuse its 1.4 million members with a new pragmatism . If the Christian Coalition is to reach its goals , members were told , they have to follow a few simple strategies : Be reasonable . Be practical . Be nice . <p> Speakers offered myriad tips for putting this approach into action . Divide the electorate into three categories , conservative strategist Paul Weyrich advised grass-roots activists : the saints , the " savables " and the sinners . " You do n't spend time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also do n't spend time with the sinners . Now theologically , that 's very bad . But politically , it 's good . " <p> Next lesson : " It is not a crime to vote for somebody less than perfect . " It 's all about leverage . " Often you can get more out of somebody that is traumatized by a close election , that needs your help , " Weyrich explained . " It 's worth electing even one of the turkeys if you have enough schwack with them that you can get ' em to work right . " <p> ' Sleeper Agents ' <p> Talk show host G. Gordon Liddy was one of the more audacious bearers of the pragmatism message . Striding to the podium to the strains of " The Stars and Stripes Forever , " he admonished a ballroom packed with coalition members not to be " abrasive " and " strident " as they try to recruit new allies . <p> The coalition has succeeded by borrowing old Communist strategies , Liddy dared to say . " Emulate even more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They had sleeper agents , agents of influence . ... If you have someone widely known as a Christian , it may be difficult to get that person into an administrative position . If that person is not constantly trumpeting his Christianity ... you can get them in there . At a key moment , you can cast a key vote , and the other side does n't know what happened to them ! " <p> Jews  --  even non-observant Jews  --  have great potential , he counseled . " They are inherently conservative , " he said . " You do n't want to alienate them and frighten them by saying , ' This is , by God , a Christian country . ' ... Remember , you need all the allies you can get . Your enemies are many and we are still few . " <p> Despite his appeal for politeness to the opposition , Liddy could n't resist a swing at the second-biggest pinata at the conference ( after Surgeon General Elders ) . When he watched President Clinton give his message on Haiti last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed was Clinton 's haircut . " Now he 's going to a Navy barber and he 's wearing a blue suit , which is the closest thing to a uniform that turkey ever put on in his life ! " <p> Despite Liddy 's momentary lapse in politeness , Joe and Lela Springer , senior citizens from Warrenton , said they got his message . " We do n't want to be pushy or offensive in our witness , " Joe said . <p> " Kindness is the key , " Lela added with a smile . <p> In the Minority <p> Baltimore attorney William Hall and his sister , Pamela Hall , who is music director at Howard University-owned WHUR-FM , were conference-hopping . They had stopped at a convention of black broadcasters and visited the Congressional Black Caucus meeting before arriving at the Christian Coalition gathering . <p> " This is a good venue for African American Christians to meet other Christians , " Pamela said . " Because oftentimes we do n't get to meet them . And we need to link together for a common cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Her brother , who is coordinator of Bill Brock 's Senate campaign in Baltimore , concurred . " I think Martin Luther King said 11 o'clock on Sunday is one of the most segregated hours in the week , " he said . " That 's a matter of culture . African Americans feel more comfortable around other African Americans , and I think white Americans feel the same way . ... The black church is still the strongest institution in the black community , and it is one of the few places where African American men can retain leadership responsibility . It 's a traditional setup . " <p> Conservative as he is , Hall acknowledged that he is in the minority at a gathering like the Congressional Black Caucus . " One of the things that helps me a lot in that regard is my relationship with God , " he said . " My relationship with God says I 'm to be at peace with all men . " <p> Hall said the coalition is urging him to bring more people of color into the fold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly , the group could use Hall 's help . In a session on minority outreach with perhaps 100 attending , only a handful of African Americans were present . <p> Souvenirs <p> These things were for sale at the Christian Coalition conference : <p> * A " Clindom " : a miniature condom that " lets you smoke without inhaling . " <p> * A video called " The Gay Agenda in Public Education . " <p> * A child-size " I 'm in God 's Army " T-shirt . <p> * A " Praise ! " exercise video : " Over 70 minutes in length featuring your favorite Hosanna ! music . Praise and worship music ! " <p> * A T-shirt reading , " A ' Condom-nation ' reaps ' condemnation . ' " <p> College senior and budding entrepreneur Bryan Skalku of Lithonia , Ga. , ran the Conservative Collectibles booth , where items for sale included the " Clinocchio " T-shirt , depicting a long-nosed Clinton with the caption " Will he ever stop lying ? " <p> " I figure I 've still got two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The reason it sells so well now is because so many people are so upset with Bill Clinton that they 'll spend money to prove it . I go outside Braves games and sell these Clinton T-shirts and make 200 bucks in an hour . " <p> In the next aisle over was the Precious Feet stall , selling jewelry depicting tiny gold footprints " the exact size and shape of an unborn baby 's feet at 10 weeks after conception . " <p> Dinah Monahan of Snowflake , Ariz. , explained that the symbol was created by her mother after someone showed her a picture of an aborted fetus . " My mother saw it and she designed what I believe was an inspiration , " Monahan says softly . " When you wear them , it is a very nonconfrontational way to speak for the humanity of the unborn . " <p> Bill Davis was proprietor of the Jeremiah Films booth , offering an array of videos . Among them : the 13-volume " Pagan Invasion " video series , including " Halloween : Trick or Treat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience , celebrate this pagan holiday ? " Also " Evolution : Hoax of the Century ? " and Volume 13 , " Doorways to Satan , " exploring how Hollywood has " brought Americans to an insatiable lust for sex , violence , witchcraft , perversion and occultic mysteries . " <p> Davis said he enjoys the plain folks who stop by . " They want honesty . They want change . And it 's very refreshing to talk to ' em , " he said . " That 's the kind of people that make up the Christian Coalition  --  they 're just nice Middle Americans . "
