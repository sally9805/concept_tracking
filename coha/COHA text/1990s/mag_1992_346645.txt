Ndokanda , a bangombe pygmy , hunkers down beside me . Holding the bridge of his nose , he lets out a loud bray  --  his dead-on imitation of the cry of small rain-forest animals called duikers . These deerlike creatures make the noise in the throes of giving birth , and Pygmies imitate it because other duikers come running when they hear the call . This time , however , the braying attracts a large band of chimpanzees , drawn by the prospect of dining on vulnerable duikers . For a moment I feel the shiver of being hunted . <P> But when the chimps spot the Pygmy and his three white companions , the animals stop dead in their tracks . Their bloodlust gives way to astonishment , as if they are seeing something they have never seen before . They begin stamping their feet , shaking their arms , calling to one another and throwing branches at us . As many as 25 animals scream from all sides . Each time we make a move , a new round of calls erupts among the chimps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , for more than two hours , the mesmerized chimps hover around us , drawing to within a few arm lengths . I am flabbergasted . Wild chimps do not react this way to humans in any other part of the African rain forest . But this is no ordinary meeting of fellow primates . For the chimps surrounding us , seeing humans amounts to an ape version of Close Encounters of the Third Kind . <P> In this drama , we are the aliens . We have ventured into the last vast unexplored rain forest on earth  --  the unsullied Ndoki region of northern Congo  --  a place where the animals do not know what to make of us because they have never seen humans before . <P> The word Ndoki ( pronounced en-doe-key ) means " sorcerer " in Lingala , and this is indeed an enchanted , mysterious place . Guarded by swamps to the south and east , hills to the north and the forbidding Ndoki River to the west , the region is almost inaccessible . Pygmies have crisscrossed central Africa for thousands of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the fringes of this 3 million-hectare ( 7.5 million-acre ) expanse of virgin forest , which is about the size of Belgium . <P> Our 15-day expedition , led by botanist Michael Fay of Wildlife Conservation International , has taken us to parts of the forest we believe no human has ever seen . We are catching a glimpse of the rarest treasure on this crowded planet : an ecosystem as pristine today as it was 12,000 years ago , before humans began to transform the earth . Our journey into unknown territory is a grand adventure , one that is as exciting as it is daunting . At one point , Fay must persuade apprehensive Pygmy trackers to continue through the Ndoki , for legend holds that the forest is home to Mokele Mbembe , a dinosaur-like creature that can kill elephants . <P> Mokele Mbembe could hardly create more of a stir than we do in this previously undisturbed land . Gorillas stare and scream at us , and sometimes charge , but almost never run away . Colobus and cercopithecus monkeys crane their necks to eye us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere the favorite game of hunters , look up from their rooting and peer at us calmly through the low brush for several minutes before moving off toward new forage.
