Only in New Zealand can you scale the Alps , explore glowworm caves , and pick orchids in December . <p> When Air New Zealand banks to land in Auckland . passengers catch their first glimpse of the color below . Bright green countryside erupts into volcanic cones filled with grass ; a million dots swell to become wandering livestock . <p> Auckland is New Zealand 's largest city and , says local Rodney Dearing , " If you want to know about New Zealand society , then Auckland 's the place . " Dearing says New Zealanders are pioneers at heart , enjoy the outdoors , and like to be surrounded by trees . That explains why the city is liberally sprinkled with parks where flowers grow in profusion and gardens are carefully tended . <p> But to really sample this two-island country , you need to travel further south , close to prime farm country . Here , visitors can enjoy rigorous sports such as black-water rafting in underground caves . Each rafter is supplied a wet suit , miner 's hat with light , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ceiling as you drift quietly along . A slight hum is heard . the water moves faster , and when it becomes a roar , you drop down a waterfall . " After that rush of adrenaline , " one participant says , " you hang on to the person in front in the dark and form a human chain through a glowworm cave . " <p> Waitomo Caves , a few miles away , were discovered a century ago and are filled with stalagmites and stalactites . " The glowworms have the ability to switch their lights off when we turn ours on , so it has to be dark to see them , " says caves guide Diane Carey . " They spin sticky lines to catch insects , 30 or 40 each , and when insects are trapped , they suck them up like a piece of spaghetti . " <p> Back above ground , in Te Awamutu , a community of gently rolling hills and perfect farms , Bob and Beryl Ferguson take in guests on " farm stays . " They still live and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racehorses because they have a share milker running the dairy . " Beryl and I milked cows for about 30 years , " Bob says , " and we had enough , so we got a bloke with lots of money to come in and buy all our cows and the machinery . We still own the land , but the share milker does all the work , and we get 50 percent . " <p> When they decided to take in guests for DB &B;  --  dinner , bed and break-fast  --  they thought it would mean rare entertainment . " Our first guest was a Canadian who was supposed to stay overnight , but we had him for a month , " Beryl jokes . " He turned out to be just splendid . He was 78 , came from Toronto , walked a lot , and did n't want to go anywhere else . " <p> A farm stay usually includes afternoon tea , walks around the property , and conversation after dinner . It can mean participating in the morning milking at 5:30 a.m. , watching dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learning about weight gain , crop rotation , animal ailments , forage and " fair dinkum authentic bull meat . " It also can mean sampling roast hogget , which is an aging lamb . " A hogget tastes best in my opinion , " Bob says , " and goes to the works ( the butcher ) between 9 months and 18 months . After that , he 's a bloody sheep . " Visiting the Natives <p> Rotorua is in the middle of the North Island . For centuries , this place of thermal action , bubbling mud , numerous explosions of steam , and sulfur smells has been home to the native Maoris . They 've learned to live with the odor and use the steam and hot water for cooking , heating , and bathing . <p> Today , Rotorua is one of New Zealand 's most popular destinations for tourists . Rainbow Springs offers nature walks through the bush , plus ponds teeming with trout , a kiwi house , and an aviary filled with native birds . A gondola takes visitors to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathtaking views of the town and the lake . <p> " These geysers erupt longer than Old Faithful , " explains Carl Leonard , a Maori guide , dancer , carver , and warrior at the Maori Arts and Crafts Institute . " Sometimes in the village , the geothermal activity causes the ground to fall away . One woman thought she had a garden until she noticed her vegetables were steaming instead of growing . A hole had opened up , and the ' garden ' had become a stewing pot . " A Capital City <p> Wellington , the capital of New Zealand , sits on the southern tip of the North Island on Cook Strait . It is the seat of government , an honor wrenched from Auckland in 1865 when gold was discovered in the South Island and commerce moved south . Houses around the city cling to precipitous slopes , the wind is usually serious , and Cook Strait is dangerous . Views over Lambton Harbour from Mt . Victoria and Tinakori Hill are fabulous , and Mr. Victoria includes a memorial to Rear Admiral Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Pole . <p> Within a few miles of Wellington is Rimutaka Forest Park , with sandy beaches and bright blue ocean , plus sheep , lambs , and seals . The mountains rise steeply upward , and rivers tumble sharply down . Visitors can opt for a short tour in the bush or along the coast to see the seals or can take more leisurely safaris into the park in four-wheel-drive vehicles . Fishing Holiday <p> Ray Grubb and his wife , Marion van der Goes , own Lake Brunner Lodge on the South Island , which you can reach via train from Christchurch across the Canterbury Plains and up through the fabulous scenery of Arthur 's Pass . Get off at the tiny station called Inchbonnie . <p> Lake Brunner is the oldest fishing destination in New Zealand and considered by some , including Grubb , to be the world 's best " fishing hole . " " It 's a difficult fishery , " Ray says , " with clear water where you see the fish before you catch them . " <p> Full-time guides are available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take nature walks , watch birds , ride horses , or visit the only white heron nesting grounds in New Zealand . <p> Marion is a masterful cook . " Fishermen get very hungry , " she says . " The food I serve is as fresh as I can get it and with good flavor . And I keep it simple . " Her touch is evident in the rooms that are pink and mauve , pretty and clean , and boast fresh flowers . Each bed has an electric blanket and several pillows . Even if the stove 's lit in the hall , guests need long johns and sweaters because the lodge is often damp and drafty . The Other Alps <p> Rain is common here . Nine inches fell one recent October day . During the siege , the roads from Greymouth to Franz Josef Glacier were often under water , the Southern Alps and the Tasman Sea could not be seen through the mists , and cows and sheep clung to the high country . Waterfalls rushed down the mountainsides , rocks and bushes slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed his cows in a driving rain toward the milking barn . A normally clear stream turned red from leaf mold and debris rushing out of the mountains . <p> " Nature rules down here , and people merely accept it . Everything is constantly in action , " says Bob McKerrow , Westland National Park 's field center manager . " The Maori name for the glacier is Naromata ohime hoketeri , which comes from a story about a woman who enjoyed walking in the mountains . One day , her lover was following her and he fell down a crevice , hence the name which means ' tear drops of the glacier woman . ' " <p> Westland National Park stretches from the main divide of the South Island to the Tasman Sea against massive rain forests and a narrow plain to the ocean 's edge . Franz Josef Glacier sits where two great tectonic plates meet . It 's an earthquake fault . The high country at the top of Franz Josef and Fox Glacier , more than 11,000 feet , claims enormous amounts of snow and frigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are beyond belief . <p> Even in pouring rain , people walk in the bush or on the glacier in rented hobnail boots , raincoats , and with guides . The area is so isolated from the rest of the country , " all the species are locked away here , " says Bob , " There are 19 species of native fresh-water fish in the area and 14 species of native orchids , which are perfect in December . And we think we 've discovered a new variety of kiwi . " The Adventurers <p> Queenstown sits at the edge of Lake Wakatipu , beneath a remarkable chain of mountains appropriately named The Remarkables . The city  --  called Queens-town because miners said it was fit for a queen  --  is famous for tramping , skiing , mountain climbing , jet boating , river rafting , bungee jumping , and golf . <p> For guided tramps across the mountains , reservations are necessary . The Milford Track is the most famous , but the Greenstone Valley Walk is also good . " The Greenstone takes three days , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident Allison Paterson . " You get a good mattress , sleeping bag , and linen , so you do n't have to carry it with you . Guides do the cooking , the huts have hot showers , and there 's always a fire to warm and dry you . " <p> When Allison and husband Jeff are not tramping , they share their home with visitors . New Zealand home stays are popular ; the locals learn about new places , and the visitors gain insights into the people and area . " We like to entertain Americans , because they accept us as we are , " says Allison . <p> If the weather is clear , you can take local helicopter flights around the mountains and longer trips to Milford Sound in the heart of fjord country . In the summer , there is river rafting , jet boating , and bungee jumping . <p> The Kawarau Bridge spans a narrow gorge 143 feet above the aquamarine Kawarau River . It was built in 1880 , taken out of commission in 1960 , and restored by A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hackett set the standards , and his commercial enterprise opened for business in 1988 . With a rubber bungee attached to an ankle harness , participants pay $85 to jump off the bridge . Bungee tension is set according to weight so the jump-master , for safety reasons , knows how far the jumper will bounce . <p> " The ankle harness causes no harm , our safety record is perfect , and about one percent change their mind and get their money back . The longer you wait , the less likely it is you 'll go , " says Andrew Brinsley , manager . More English Than The English <p> Christchurch is at the edge of the Canterbury Plains , a rich agricultural area opened in 1850 by 782 English settlers . A statue of Queen Victoria stands at the entrance to Victoria Square , many street names boast of an English heritage , and the gently flowing Avon River slices through the center of town . Punts ( small , shallow boats with flat bottoms and square ends , propelled by poles ) take riders up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same name in Shakespeare 's birthplace . <p> Christchurch 's port , Lyttelton Harbour , named after an English lord , is to the south . It is set in a volcanic cone that opens itself up to the Pacific . Coach tours offer overviews of the city and its history , besides trips to the harbor ; many include Devonshire tea . Skiing in the mountains to the west is good through spring . The wizard of Canterbury resides at Cathedral Square , as does the town crier , a historical figure who rings his bell and reads the day 's news . Self-guided walks start here . And The Kiwi Beat Goes On <p> An Englishman once described New Zealand as " a bloody great farm . " He had a point . However , the two-island nation offers more than a rural holiday in a remote destination that seems remarkably like home . Where else can you scale the Alps , explore glowworm caves , steam your dinner in a thermal stewpot , and pick orchids in December ? <p> PHOTO : Weather permitting , visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glacier . The more adventuresome can plan an overnight trek to the hut on the 11,437-foot Mount Tasman . <p> PHOTO : Because New Zealand wildlife is carefully protected , tourists are likely to encounter yellow-eyed penguins , fur seals , albatross , and cormorants . Fishing trips can yield salmon that weigh more than 30 pounds . <p> PHOTO : Bungee jumping off the Kawarau Bridge is considered a " personal achievement " for persons willing to pay $85 for the honor . A videotape documents the jumper 's bravery . <p> PHOTO : Barely the size of Colorado , New Zealand is home to 3 million people and 65 million sheep . No visit to the two-island nation is complete without tea at a farmhouse and a demonstration of sheep shearing . <p> PHOTO : Considered more British than Britain , Christchurch boasts a town crier , a wizard of Canterbury , and a river called Avon . Here , visitors enjoy a leisurely cruise through town . <p> By C. J. Hadley <p>                @ @ @ @ @
