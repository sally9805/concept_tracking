Inflation runs riot , sapping an already weakened economy ; people go cold and hungry . A weak democratic government fails to maintain order , and is vilified by nationalists furious at the country 's fall from world power to beggary . An attempted coup designed to install a dictatorship collapses , and its leaders are tried for treason . But after a final economic breakdown marked by mass unemployment , fascists come to power with wide popular support and institute a ruthless totalitarianism . <P> Historical parallels are never exact , of course . The Soviet Union is not fated to replay this capsule history of Germany 's Weimar Republic . But the possibility can not be dismissed either . And this time the drama might not take as long as the nine-plus years that elapsed between the failure of Adolf Hitler 's 1923 beer-hall putsch and the founding of the Third Reich . <P> Some experts fear trouble in Russia and other Soviet republics even this winter , if food shortages deepen into famine and provoke riots . " Perhaps the threat of dictatorship has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says former Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze , who accurately foretold the failed August coup attempt by old-line communists . " I am afraid of uncontrolled , spontaneous ( ( crowd ) ) movements , " he adds . " The people are tired , and food is lacking . " <P> Lev Timofeyev , a prominent Russian republic economist , is more specific , and even gloomier . Says he : " If we do not introduce full-fledged private-property rights and freedom of private entrepreneurship within the next two months , we are in for such catastrophes and upheavals that they will sweep away ( ( Russian President Boris ) ) Yeltsin , ( ( Prime Minister Ivan ) ) Silayev and you and me . This country is already in the midst of a real economic and financial catastrophe . If the West does not help us , we are in for some very serious attempts to restore a fascist-type regime . " <P> Moreover , even if Russia and the other republics somehow get through the winter and begin the economic shock treatment Timofeyev demands , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy , which may not bring prosperity for many years . Meanwhile , the nation is certain to suffer rising unemployment as inefficient industries are shut down and continued inflation as more and more prices are set free . That would be an explosive mix anywhere , but especially in the U.S.S.R. ( or whatever loose confederacy may succeed it ) . Inefficient as the old communist economy was , it did provide jobs of a sort for everybody and a steady , if meager , supply of basic goods at low , subsidized prices ; Soviet citizens for more than 70 years were conditioned to expect that from their government . Says a Moscow worker : " We had everything during ( ( Leonid ) ) Brezhnev 's times . There was sausage in the stores . We could buy vodka . Things were normal . " <P> But if there are disturbing resemblances to Weimar , there are also heartening differences . One is the diametrically opposite attitude of foreign governments . The victors of World War I were bent on humiliating and punishing Germany and saddled the Weimar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources . The winners of the cold war are warmly encouraging nascent democracy in what used to be the U.S.S.R. and are considering pumping in money and goods to prop it up .
