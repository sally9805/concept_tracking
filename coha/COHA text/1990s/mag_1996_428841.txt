Very few stars among the billions in our galaxy have received individual attention , and of those only a handful have been scrutinized as intensely as Eta Carinae . This truly massive blue variable , weighing about 100 Suns , gained its fame in the mid-19th century when it underwent a 20-year eruption to become the second-brightest star in the sky for a brief period . That unusual outburst produced a circumstellar bipolar nebula , which itself has been the subject of much study ( S &; T October 1995 , page 12 ) . In 1995 an international team of astronomers led by Kris Davidson ( University of Minnesota ) observed ultraviolet emission from the nebula with the Hubble Space Telescope . Team member Sveneric Johansson ( University of Lund ) spotted unusually bright ionized-iron emission and determined that the best explanation for the phenomenon is also highly unusual : an ultraviolet laser . " There simply are n't that many ultraviolet photons around , " says Davidson . " Natural infrared lasers are very rare in space ; this ultraviolet laser is even more difficult for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen before . " Johansson presented these results last December at a conference in Paris . The researchers hope to return to Eta Carinae with HST to study the nebular gas over a wider range of wavelengths. // Pulsating Eta Carinae // In another area of Eta Carinae research , Augusto Damineli ( University of Sao Paulo ) has found a 5Y2-year cycle wherein periodic dimming of certain spectral lines coincides with peaks in the star 's near-infrared light curve . Damineli believes that this cycle represents recurrent episodes of radial expansion and cooling in the star 's photosphere . In Astrophysical Journal Letters for March 20th , Damineli points out that the 5 1/2year cycle fits well with all brightening episodes in Eta Carinae recorded during the past 50 years , as well as with three large outbursts noted in the last century . The next outburst is predicted to occur around December 1997 . Finally , a team of astronomers led by Arnout M. van Genderen ( Leiden Observatory ) observed Eta Carinae from October 1992 to August 1994 with the 50-centimeter Danish telescope at the European Southern Observatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented evidence that the star pulsated with a period of 58 days during a relatively quiet period between the larger outbursts . These presumably nonradial pulsations are indicative of aging massive stars . <p>
