<p> " Hey , man , you do n't have to answer to anyone in this scene . That 's what it 's all about . . . Know what I mean , man ? "  --  Jack Nicholson in " Psych-Out . " <p> WHAT BETTER place to revive " Psych-Out , " a melodrama about the hippie love generation of the 1960s , than at the Red Vic Movie House , located in the heart of the Haight-Ashbury , the very place where the movie was shot in the latter months of 1967 . <p> When the film screens Friday through next Sunday it will serve as a time machine to the San Francisco days when love was the word on the street , beads were the most popular form of jewelry , the young were called " flower children " and " do your own thing " was the catch phrase for a generation that had eschewed the Establishment to live a loose , free , indolent lifestyle . <p> " Psych-Out " was produced by Dick Clark for American-International Pictures and stars Jack Nicholson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ponytailed leader of a psychedelic rock quartet . His co-star , Susan Strasberg , portrays a naive deaf woman who arrives in the Haight looking for her missing brother . She 's quickly befriended by Nicholson 's live-in band mates , who dress her in a miniskirt and introduce her to LSD and other hallmarks of the generation . <p> The philosopher of the gang ( " it 's all one big plastic hassle " ) is Dean Stockwell , who wears an Indian headband and serves as the conscience of Nicholson whenever his old Establishment ways start to dictate his behavior . Hanging around the edges of the Haight is Bruce Dern as a crazed sculptor nicknamed The Seeker , whose motto is " God is alive and well in a sugar cube " but who has burned himself out on one LSD cube too many . The Seeker , who looks like a derelict Jesus Christ , also happens to be Strasberg 's missing brother . <p> It is an unusually objective portrait  --  neither endorsing nor criticizing the counterculture lifestyle  --  that became one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards the film is uncommonly tame . But that also makes the film seem an encapsulation of a fascinating time and place , unflawed by genre demands , and hence very likable and approachable . There is no raw sex or bloody violence  --  one is able to sense that director Richard Rush was trying to accomplish his portrait of hippie life with a sense of integrity . <p> Reached at his office in Los Angeles , Rush admitted he had n't seen the film in a while , but he clearly recalled the film 's evolution . " It 's really part of an unofficial trilogy of films I made for AIP in 1967 , the others being ' Hell 's Angels on Wheels ' also with Nicholson and ' The Savage Seven . ' I 'd first worked with Nicholson as far back as 1961 in my very first picture , ' Too Soon to Love , ' so we 'd already established a good working relationship . " <p> He recalled that " I felt great trepidation about doing these films but I had a mortgage to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out ' is a picture I 'm fond of . I did n't feel that way 15 years ago ; then it did n't seem to hold up culturally , it seemed specifically ' 60s in attitude and style . But the last time I saw it I decided its attitude and style now are exactly what give it its charm and a sense of historical depiction . " <p> Out of " Psych-Out , " Rush said , " emerged the Nicholson persona that would stick with him . Mostly a s- -  --  eating grin that says ' I 'm putting up a brave front but I 'm really a phony . ' An irrevocable charm was behind that persona , and it was exciting to watch it grow on the screen . " <p> Rush , who went on to make big-budget features for the studios such as " Getting Straight " ( 1970 ) , " Freebie and the Bean " ( 1974 ) and " The Stunt Man " ( 1980 ) , arrived in San Francisco in the late fall of ' 67 with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which originally had been titled " The Love Children " when Nicholson wrote the first draft . That script had been rewritten by E. Hunter Willett and Betty Ulius , and then revised extensively again by Rush before the cameras rolled . <p> " I personally felt that the hippie movement was the most exciting , glorious sociological event of the century , " Rush said . " It symbolized the anti-war movement , it marked the birth of the ecology age and it recognized a kind of oneness with nature . All monetary and material things were discarded in favor of spiritual ones . It was the total antithesis of yuppism . " <p> But the counterculture did n't think that Rush and his crew were so cool when they hit the Haight- Ashbury . " There was a definite hostility toward us . The hippies took one look at our trucks and equipment and figured we were there to exploit the movement . " <p> Rush could n't call the police  --  " that would have alienated everyone even more . So I solved the problem in a macabre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Angels who had worked for me previously in ' Hell 's Angels on Wheels ' and ' Savage Seven . ' I felt awful about it . I felt like I was doing a film about the French underground and calling in Nazis . But the hippies had an immediate respect for the Angels  --  the common denominator was dope and a sense that they were all outlaws . " <p> RUSH refused to use the film as a way of preaching . " The movement was so colorful I felt it spoke for itself , negative or positive . I wanted to permeate the look and feeling of the hippies and capture the vague inarticulateness between people . If the film takes any stand , it 's against drugs , but even that is implicit and never verbally addressed . " <p> There are attempts , however , to capture the psychedelia of the LSD experience . In one sequence , a hippie on a bad trip imagines his friends as zombies from a horror movie and tries to cut off his hand with a power saw . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stream of fire . The one soft-focus love scene symbolizes the mating of Nicholson and Strasberg with scenes of wheat fields and flowers . This was just before the demise of the Hollywood code , so Rush was forced to shoot the scenes out of focus . <p> The film does not have the crude look of many low-budget efforts , an asset that Rush accredits to his cinematographer , Hungarian-born Laszlo Kovacs , who went on to become the director of photography on many major films in the 1970s and ' 80s . " Kovacs was a daring cameraman , the best hand- held cameraman I 've ever encountered , " Rush recalled . " We experimented with ' critical focus , ' a photographic style that uses long lenses and demands careful focusing . The technique we started later became an industry standard . " <p> Strasberg , the daughter of acting coach Lee Strasberg , was brought into the project by Nicholson . She was 29 , married to actor Christopher Jones and had a year- old daughter . " She brought a lot of talent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others in the cast in small parts are Henry Jaglom , who would go on to become an independent producer-director , and Garry Marshall , who would develop into a major TV producer and film director ( " Pretty Woman " ) . <p> By the time Rush had finished shooting " Psych-Out , " he noticed a major change in the Haight-Ashbury . " It had been a glorious summer in ' 67 , but once winter hit , the runaways without shelter found the going difficult . By then the dope thing had lasted too long and had become a necessity instead of an experiment . The Vietnam War was not ending  --  in fact it was escalating . And riot control was setting in . Two years later I would be concerned about students at the barricade in ' Getting Straight . ' The best of hippie times was over . "
