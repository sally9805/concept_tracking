Last March , Laurel Winter gave us the gentle fantasy story " David 's Ashes . " She returns now with a tale of two sisters , a melancholy story , yet one that leaves a lingering sweet taste . <p> ANZY WOKE ME . " TRY THIS , " she said , putting a cup to my mouth just as I exhaled a dream breath . Too hot , but my mouth barely noticed . Summer , I tasted . Being young . One of the wild cousins of mint . Sun filtered through green leaves . " Oh , yes , " I said , gulping down as much as I could before she took the cup away . She never let me have a whole cup of any tea . Just tastes , so I would never be satisfied . A good taster is never satisfied . " What do you call it ? " She smiled . " Seventh Summer . Do you think that 's right ? Something that evokes childhood . Actually , I was thinking more of being eight , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I tasted the name , too . In my sister 's business , the brewing of names is almost as important as the brewing of teas . " That 's good . " I coughed on the last word , and Sister let me have another sip of summer tea . I held it in my mouth for a moment before I swallowed , savoring youth , wellness , warmth . When it was gone , though , I shivered . " Poor darling , " she said , pulling the green and gold afghan up to my chin and tucking me in . " I should n't have wakened you , but the tea buyer is coming tomorrow and I wanted to get this ready . Forgive me . " I just nodded and closed my eyes . The afghan is one I made as a girl and stored in my wedding chest . Anzy fetched it a few years ago , shook out the cedar chips , brought it to my bed . Perhaps I should have called the box of hopeful belongings a funeral chest instead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her voice poked a hole in the sleep that was forming around me . I opened my eyes again . Her long gray hair was pinned back haphazardly , as usual . She envied my hair , I knew , soft silver curls . I kept it short , because lying on a pillow all the time would tangle long hair . Anzy cut my hair for me ; sometimes I suspected she cut it crooked out of jealousy , but it still looked good . Hair was such a small thing to envy , when she had everything else . " Of course , dear sister . Bring another tea . " When she brought it , I could tell from the scent that it was one of her dark teas . I almost refused , but she brought it up to my lips firmly and tipped the cup . If I did n't drink , it would spill on my afghan and the scent would be with me for days and the stain forever - or at least for as much of forever as I was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the tea in . Bitter . Salted with tears . Cool as the earth at grave depth . But curiously , the flavor lightened as it passed through my mouth , the bitter and salt transforming into a soft , new flavor that kissed my tongue and evaporated , leaving pure , cool water to flow down my throat . She did n't ask me if I liked it . " Does it work ? " Her fingers were nervous around the cup . " It 's called " Beyond . " " I just nodded , too tired to compliment her further , too tired to taste another tea . I closed my eyes and let the sleep take me away from the bed and the tea and the sister with long gray hair . When I woke up , the tea buyer was there , tasting the new teas , getting reacquainted with a few old favorites he had almost forgotten . " Ah , " he said , " I 'll take as much Night Silk as you have . " " You 'll take it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anzy , her voice daring and teasing and coquettish . Which of course the tea buyer did n't notice . He was young and strong and rakish , even though he was n't handsome . What interest would he have in an old woman with untidy gray hair ? I saw him through the sheer curtain that separated my room from the kitchen . He was sitting on the bench at the side of the table , on the end farthest from my room . His expression stayed serious and businesslike . " Oh , I 'm sure I have plenty of things to trade . New silks , fine dried seafish , sweet spices and sour , something for your sister . " He looked toward the curtain then , although I 'm sure he could n't see me in the darkened room . That 's another thing my sister envies ; the tea buyer always asks about me and sometimes gives me a small gift : usually a book . I can not read the books anymore ; my hands tire , and my eyes , and my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't read , what they might say .... Anzy tossed her head . " You 'll have to have all that and more to go away with my fine new teas . " Ah , so I had n't slept through the tasting of the new teas . I inched myself up on the pillow , to see better . Anzy set five stone jars on the table , warm from the oven , not too close to one another . Into each she put a pinch of a new tea . Then boiling water from the long-spouted kettle into the first jar and the last . I shuddered , knowing that would be the dark new tea , the one to drink cool . I wanted to taste it again , and yet I did n't . The tea buyer bent over the first stone jar and took in the aroma as it brewed . His eyes closed as he concentrated . When the tea was brewed to my sister 's satisfaction , she put a net over a clean cup and poured the tea . I wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot jars in her bare hands , but she is a brewer , and has done it so many times she does n't notice anymore . Just as the tea buyer does n't notice when the tea is hot enough to scald a lesser tongue . While he was bringing the cup to his lips , she moved to the end of the table and poured the last cup , to sit and cool . I could tell he was curious over this , for most of her teas are for drinking hot . His eyes followed her as she poured , but then he brought himself back to the cup in his hands . I like to try to predict which tea he is tasting by the expression on his face as it enters his mouth : surprised or pleased or shocked or whatever . This time , there was just mild satisfaction , so I guessed Twilight Garden , which I found adequate , but a bit boring . " I call this Twilight Garden , " she said , when he did n't speak . " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the bench to sit before the second jar . My sister frowned , erased the expression , and poured the second jar . This time it was Seventh Summer and the tea buyer fell in love with it . " Yes , yes , " he said , " I can sell this tea . " He even allowed himself to take a second sip , and a third . My sister waited , looking smug , until he moved to the third jar . Coming Home , it was ; a mix of familiar and strange . And the fourth was Rejoice . The tea buyer liked both of them , although not as well as Seventh Summer . And then it was time for the last cup . My sister held her hand above the cup , checking the temperature . " Wait , " she said . The tea buyer waited , sniffing the air above the cup for its dark aroma . I 'm sure my sister let him wait longer than was necessary , to build his anticipation . He was at the nearest end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could smell the tea from my bed- or at least imagine that I did . My sister tested the temperature again , then curled her fingers around the cup and gave it to him . I saw the bitterness bite him , the sad saltiness , and then his eyes widened at the sudden touch of flavor that vanished even as he met it . He looked toward the curtain ; perhaps he saw me , lying in the darkness ready to die . " Beyond , " whispered my sister . He did not take a second taste , but he nodded to her , to acknowledge the power of the tea . My sister cleared the jars away while he went out for his goods . She hurried , spilling some of the Seventh Summer tea ; it smelled like life itself . After she wiped it up , she peeked around the edge of the curtain and saw me lying awake . " Did you see ? " she whispered . " He loved them all . " " Except the Twilight Garden , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She sniffed . " He 'll buy some . Now why do n't you nap for a while ; you 're bound to be tired . " I wanted to see the trading . " No , " I said , although I was . " Open the shutter for me . " She did , although she clearly did n't want to . When the shutter was open , one could see in through the door curtain as easily as out . Whenever I was awake , the tea buyer always came in for a moment and talked with me and gave me a gift . Anzy banged the shutter to one side and left the room . The door curtain was still swaying when he entered the kitchen with his bulging pack . " Greetings , " he called to me . " I hope we did not wake you with our dealing out here . " " No , " I said . " No , I was awake . " He smiled and thumped the pack down on the cleared table . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a book , " said my sister , her voice cold . " She has n't read the last ones yet - and wo n't ever . " The tea buyer looked at me , and saw the truth of her words . " Oh , it is n't a book , " he said , although I could tell he was lying . " I brought you something else this time . " I could see him thinking fast . " First I must do my trading with your sister , though . " Her face flushed , and that was gift enough for me . He had business dealings with my sister ; he did n't have to talk to me . She was angry , so she did n't trade well . The tea buyer tried to tease her out of it , but she did n't let go . I saw the point where his lips tightened up and he decided to use her anger against her . She was too angry to see . I felt a hollow pleasure , watching them . The tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think well with the anger in her head . And the envy . There is something to be said for being envied , but she was getting less dried fish - which I love - and less of everything else as well . I tried to think of a way to help her , but I was so tired , and I had to save the energy to stay awake for my present . I saw the small book that he had been planning to give to me ; he whisked it back into his pack as soon as it turned up . Was he lingering over the wares as he traded , deciding what would be my gift ? He did not take any of the Twilight Garden . He took fifty packets each of Coming Home and Rejoice , all of the Seventh Summer , and all but one of the Beyond , as well as a good assortment of her older teas . For this he gave silks and spices and dried fish and meat and fruits and some pressed paper and deep blue ink - but not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creations . She just wanted him to pack up and go away , I could tell , and he began to do so . He packed up the teas in tight bundles and placed them in the far interior , where there was no chance of them getting wet , even if the pack fell in a river . He packed up the extra fruits and meats and the rolls of cloth - except for one . He put one in his pocket and my heart leaped . And I was right . After he had his pack tied , he came through the curtain and sat right on the edge of the bed . " You ca n't lie there reading all the time , " he said . " It will spoil your eyes . " He reached into the pocket and pulled out a piece of silk , blue and blue and blue , a dozen different colors of blue , and worked with threads of silver . " This will go with your blue eyes and your silver hair . " He actually lifted my head up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck , with the ends trailing down to my hands so I could feel it between my fingers . I could n't do more than smile my thanks . Sleep crept over me and wrapped me in silk . WHEN I WOKE UP , the tea buyer was gone . Anzy had put away all the goods she 'd bartered for and was sitting at the table creating a new tea with my silk tied around her head , hiding her dull , gray hair . She looked almost beautiful , with the silk accenting her blue eyes . " It 's mine , " I said , trying to sit up . She looked at me through the curtain , and untied the silk . " Of course . You were asleep . I did n't think you 'd mind . " She came in , draped the silk over me like a blanket . I minded . " You will have it soon enough , when I am dead . " There was a silence deeper than her darkest tea . We did not talk about my dying ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since we were girls , really . Now it was near , and I knew it , and so did she . She had brewed it into her latest tea . I gathered the silk in my hands . " Let me have it as long as I am able , my last gift from the tea buyer . " I was tired again , my eyelids falling shut as she nodded . My time was spent in sleep , in tiny moments of waking , in sips of tea and my sister 's hands stroking my face with the edge of the silk - when she was n't bathing me , or changing the bedclothes . Or working in the kitchen . She was brewing a new tea , something difficult ; sometimes I would open my eyes for a few seconds , just in time to see her dump her attempts thus far and start over . Sometimes she would be crying . And then she woke me , my head held in the crook of her arm , the other hand holding a cup of tea . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for you . " She held it to my lips . " Taste it . " The new tea seared my lips , too hot again . It burned my tongue with promise , a flavor that built up and up and up until you knew there was no end to it , no end to anything . Sweet and sour and bitter and salt - all of them together , but mainly sweet . I asked a question with my eyes . " Tomorrow Tea , " she said . " I call it Tomorrow Tea . " " He 'll buy it , " I whispered . She gave me another sip , and when I had swallowed , another . The taste built forever in my mouth : cities that would never fall , infinite gardens , the wind and the sea . She helped me drink the entire cup , leaving me full of tomorrow . " Wear the silk , " I murmured . I moved one hand , to try and give it to her , but the effort made me sleep again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant . Did I hang onto life until he came again ? Was I already dead ? Did the Tomorrow Tea give me a glimpse of time yet to come ? The tea buyer sat beside my sister at the long table . She wore the silk on her head . They both drank cool , dark , bitter tea that turned to water in the back of their throats and left a fleeting taste of wonder . There was a curtain between us . And I was there and then gone , with the taste of tomorrow carrying me into something other than sleep as my eyes closed .
