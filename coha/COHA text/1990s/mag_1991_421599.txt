<p> Where do we go from here ? Today 's fossil fuels wo n't become fuel fossils overnight , but now is the time to look seriously for other energy sources . Will coal , even so-called clean coal , be stoking the world 's stove in 2025 ? Will petroleum products propel our cars  --  and continue to wreak havoc on fragile ecosystems ? Never has the cost of energy  --  the environmental cost , that is  --  been more profound . <p> The urgency with which the earth 's citizens investigate these questions , in fact , has never been greater . Policymakers and politicians have gotten wind of this buildup of harmful greenhouse gases around the globe , primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels . They must answer to an increasingly concerned public no longer willing to tolerate the polluting energy sources and policies of the past . <p> Researchers and engineers are also hunkering down , fine-tuning the technologies for clean , renewable energy alternatives . Forward-thinking entrepreneurs are pitching in , too , by finding the means to make them economical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an array of renewable energy sources that hold promise for the future . The status reports that follow highlight some of the energy options facing world leaders and utility companies . As we race toward the twenty-First century , however , we will need to face an even greater issue : Our entire energy infrastructure must be reevaluated . On to the post-fossil era . <p> Illustrated by PETER MENZEL <p> HAS SOLAR ECLIPSED ? <p> Once upon a time , solar power was the golden child of energy . In the Seventies politicians embraced it , environmentalists hailed it as the answer to the energy crisis , and enterprising businesses took advantage of generous federal incentives to develop solar ventures , President Jimmy Carter even had solar panels installed on the White House . <p> Within months of President Ronald Reagan 's inauguration , however , he ditched the solar collectors , signaling the slashing of solar research budgets for eight consecutive years . From 1981 to 1989 , U.S. funding for solar energy and other renewables was cut from $750 million to $150 million , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collector manufacturers went out of business or left for other shores . <p> Despite federal funding barriers , however , the solar industry has flourished . More than 1.2 million U.S. buildings now sport solar water heating systems , and the political climate for developing other uses for solar energy appears , well , sunny . And in 1990 federal research and development budgets increased by 30 percent . " In the Seventies there was virtually no solar industry , " says Scott Sklar , executive director of the Solar Energy Industries Association . " Today it 's a mature , billion-dollar industry . Nowhere is this more apparent than in California 's Mojave Desert , where an array of collectors now produces roughIy 350 megawatts of power , almost half the capacity of a nuclear power plant and 92 percent of the world 's solar supply . Built by the Luz Corporation , the system uses mirrors mounted on parabolic troughs to focus sunlight onto pipes carrying synthetic oil . Heat from the oil creates steam that drives a turbine generator . Luz 's electricity costs about eight cents per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawback : Prime sites for such solar thermal-electric plants are confined to the sunny Southwest . Other solar technologies , however , such as seasonal solar energy storage systems could potentially fill in where sunlight is less abundant . Demonstrated primarily in Europe , these systems gather heat during summer months and store it underground for use in the winter . <p> Solar photovoltaic cells , however , hold the greatest potential . Semiconductor devices , photovoltaics convert sunlight directly into electricity , producing no pollution or noise , and do n't require any moving parts . Today 's best cells convert 36 percent of their area 's sunlight into electricity , up from about 16 percent in the mid-Seventies . Promising thin-film devices , one fiftieth the thickness of human hair , should let the sun shine even brighter . <p> Photovoltaic electricity now costs five times more than conventionally produced energy . But photovoltaics should eventually yield electricity cheaper than what we have today because thin-film cells can be easily mass-produced , says Princeton University energy analyst Robert Williams . <p> The climate for solar development may be improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late for the United States to reclaim its early edge in the world market . " It 's a question of whether we 're going to do it ourselves or sit back and let the Japanese run our solar energy factories , just like they 're doing in the auto industry , " Sklar says . <p> By Steve Nadis <p> BIOMASS FOR THE MASSES <p> In a remote village in central India , a barefoot farmer beams with pride as he shows off the community 's power source : an underground tank where cow manure , straw , and other plant residues are converted into methane gas for cooking and lighting . <p> Bioenergy-burning plants , wood , and agricultural waste for fuel-is nearly as old as man , Today millions of Indians and Chinese use such materials for energy . Biomass , mainly in the form of firewood , already provides 14 percent of the world 's energy , equal to the 21 million barrels of oil produced by OPEC every day , according to the Biomass Users Network , a consortium of 46 Third World nations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuels , researchers are now taking a closer look at the potential of biomass energy . By converting biomass to electricity in numerous small-scale power plants , Third World countries could radically reduce their consumption of oil and coal , says Princeton 's Robert Williams . <p> Indeed , produced at a sustainable rate , biomass has a lot going for it . Carbon dioxide , released when biomass is processed , burned , or fermented , balances the carbon dioxide consumed during photosynthesis . The bottom line : Unlike fossil fuels , biomass does not contribute to global warming . <p> Williams believes biomass , especially in the form of wood chips and sugarcane waste , could power electric plants that use new technologies borrowed from jet engines , as well as the coal-fired power plants that biomass could ultimately phase out . The plants would rely on gasification , a process of converting the solid fuel into gas by burning it with low oxygen , similar to banking a fire in a wood stove by shutting down the air intake . A by-product of gasification , carbon monoxide would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; waste heat would be recycled to power an additional steam-driven electric generator . <p> Such technologies could easily furnish electricity in the 80 developing nations that grow sugar . Over the next 40 years , the gasification of waste bagasse , the part of sugarcane with the juice extracted , could produce 70 percent more electric power than all the countries produced by burning coal and oil in 1987 . Biomass power plants could also gasify low-quality wood harvested from forests or grown as an energy crop on hundreds of millions of acres of nonproductive grasslands , pastures , range , and deforested lands . <p> To succeed , producing energy trom biomass will require responsible agricultural and industrial practices , warns Sam Baldwin , a physicist with the Off ice of Technology Assessment . In Brazil , for example , 44 million cars are currently powered by ethanol , a biomass fuel made from fermented sugar , and the discharge of untreated ethanol by-products has fouled many of the rivers in the country 's northwest . <p> Moreover , if countries fail to use only surplus , waste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up consuming trees needed to control erosion , dung needed for fertilizer , straw necessary to replenish soils , and even such food ingredients as cornstarch and sugar . " I 'd hate to see a choice being made between food for the poor and fuel for the rich , " Baldwin says . <p> By Ben Barber <p> NUCLEAR WINNER ? <p> The two words nuclear energy pack as much emotional punch as A-bomb , cancer , or AIDS . Chernobyl and Three Mile Island have become emblems of great hopes dashed much as the Challenger disaster forced NASA to overhaul the U.S. space program . Unlike the space program , however , the nation 's nuclear industry-which has contracted no new plants since 1978-appears indefinitely stalled . <p> But not doomed . Growing concern about global warming may offer the ailing industry a chance for a comeback , says Carl Goldstein , vice president of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness . According to a 1989 council report , nuclear-generated electricity reduced utility emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 percent . Nuclear plants produce almost no particulate emissions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor do they generate noise or visible pollution or require large numbers of vehicles to haul fuel . <p> That 's the good news . The downside of nuclear power-the safety of reactors and the disposal of radioactive waste-continues to challenge researchers . Nuclear 's " second coming " will require solutions to both problems . <p> Most American nuclear power plants , including the one that neared meltdown at Three Mile Island , have light water reactors . For many of them , when problems crop up , plant personnel must activate systems designed to avert potential disasters . The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) is currently reviewing plans for an advanced light water reactor ( ALWR ) that takes human fallibility into account . It sports passive safety features dependent on natural physical processes  --  gravity , natural circulation , and convection . The ALWR is simpler to build and operate and has lower generating costs than current nuclear plants . <p> The United States is far from alone in the search for a safe reactor . One promising though untried reactor is the process inherent ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reactor would be completely submerged in a pool of water laced with heat-absorbing boron and would cool by natural convection . The reactor would be virtually invulnerable to a catastrophe caused by operator error , terrorist attack , or conventional war , <p> Even as scientists come up with safer reactors , they still must solve the problems of storing long-lived radioactive waste and decommissioning worn-out reactors . To date public outcry has halted the establishment of any long-term dump site for nuclear by-products . <p> Indeed , widespread fear of nuclear power may be the industry 's foremost roadblock . In two recent polls , more than 75 percent of Americans reported that they believed nuclear power to be important . The same percentage of respondents , however , rejected or reserved judgment on a nuclear plant in their own neighborhoods . <p> Thomas Murley , director of the NRC 's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation , believes time is on nuclear 's side . " In the beginning , people were afraid of electricity or of riding in a vehicle that ran on gasoline , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ten years with an accident , then they might begin to feel that nuclear power really is a viable alternative . " <p> By Steven Scott Smith <p> LAST GAS <p> Picture this : The earth 's deserts are sown with solar collectors , sprouting vast fields of photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight directly into electricity . An electric current is then passed through pools of water , splitting the H2O into its component gases ( one part oxygen , two parts hydrogen ) . Hydrogen gas is captured , stored , and piped to urban areas . Boilers burn it to heat homes . Power plants use it to fire the generators that produce electricity , Filling stations pump it into cars , trucks , and buses . Hydrogen , the most abundant element in the universe , is harnessed in the service of humankind . And because it returns to the atmosphere and recombines with oxygen , all you get when you burn it is more water . <p> Although solar technologies are not the only way to electrolyze water and produce hydrogen gas , solar-based hydrogen systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan Ogden of Princeton University 's Center for Energy and Environmental Studies estimates that it would take only 24,000 square miles of solar collectors ( about half of one percent of U.S. land area ) for hydrogen to replace all of the oil used in the United States . <p> Hydrogen enjoys widespread use in industry today , most notably to manufacture ammonia and process petroleum products ; and photovoltaic technology is familiar to anyone with a solar-powered. pocket calculator . But an overhaul like the one Ogden envisions , requiring the erection of a whole new energy infrastructure , is decades away . <p> Steady advances in solar-cell technology may advance the hydrogen age in more piecemeal fashion . By the mid-Nineties , Solarex , the largest U.S.- owned manufacturer of photovoltaic cells , will be inexpensively mass-producing photovoltaics made of ordinary window glass coated with a thin film of silicon . By the end of this decade , Solarex vice president David Carlson believes , solar-hydrogen systems will begin to appear on a small , independent scale in communities isolated from traditional energy sources . A village in Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array , hook it up to a modest-size electrolyzer , electrolyze the hydrogen on-site , and then store or use it for heat and car fuel , or run it through fuel cells to generate electricity at night . <p> Hydrogen-powered cars , of course , require an infrastructure before they become commonplace . ( Hydrogen gas stations , for example , must be readily accessible . ) In the meantime , engineers face a big challenge : how to store enough hydrogen in a car to give the vehicle a reasonable traveling range , BMW has developed a car that runs on liquid hydrogen and has a range of 190 to 200 miles . But the system still requires two to three times the volume of a normal gasoline tank . Liquid hydrogen must also be kept at - 423 degrees F , making self-service hydrogen gas pumps impossible , says Christoph Huss , BMW 's product information manager in North America . And because some hydrogen may be released when the engine is not running , garages would have to sport sophisticated ventilation systems . <p> Beyond the technical obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , " Solar energy in the Sahara alone can supply the world 's energy needs , " Huss says . " But if you use the Sahara or the desert in the Arabian states , many people will still be afraid of depending on these countries for energy . " <p> Considering the Persian Gulf conflict , Huss 's point is well taken . But with fossil fuel supplies dwindling , political discussions of the future of clean , limitless hydrogen may well be academic . <p> By Mary McDonald <p> HOT PROSPECTS <p> Deep within the earth , where tectonic plates collide , magma boils and sputters , creating a steamy brew that represents a gold mine of untapped power : geothermal energy . <p> Mexico , New Zealand , and Iceland already produce much of their energy from geothermal , and scientists say the Philippines , Indonesia , and other oil-poor developing nations of the Pacific Rim , rich in volcanic heat , could easily reap this earthly treasure . But geothermal energy also promises to help meet America 's power needs . <p> Current systems , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam deposits 6,000 feet to 10,000 feet below the ground to turn turbines and generate electricity , Science , however , is fine-tuning the process . Acting as high-tech divining rods , computers pinpoint geothermal hot spots , and a new crop of sturdy pipes and materials defy the corroding heat of the underground . Scientists at Southeaster Massachusetts University , moreover , are perfecting systems that test the resilience of well gear in the lab , a step up from costly wait-and-see drilling . <p> Researchers are also finding ways to trick nature into providing an endless supply of steam by making use of hot dry rock . To test the technology , U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) scientists have targeted a site in the mountains near New Mexico 's Los Alamos National Laboratory where volcanoes rumbled hundreds of thousands of years ago . <p> To produce steam , scientists drill two wells 10,000 to 15,000 feet deep into rock and then force water down one well to create fractures in the bottoms of both wells , The goal : to pump water through the latticework of fractures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam . <p> Molten rock , however , represents an even hotter geothermal prospect . In a pilot project in Long Valley , California , DOE researchers will drill down 20,000 feet to just above the chamber of molten rock in a dormant volcano , where temperatures could reach 1200 degrees C  --  potentially producing enough steam energy to power a city of 1 million . <p> But you do n't have to have a volcano in your backyard to take advantage of the earth 's changing temperature , says Paul Lienau , director of the Oregon Institute of Technology 's Geo-Heat Center . Some 110,000 homes and businesses nationwide use low-temperature heat pumps that rely on a network of pipes less than ten feet underground . The pipes are warmed in winter and cooled in summer . Water running through the pipes heats or cools the facilities . The cost : about $8,000 per unit . <p> Within 20 years , says Ted Mock , the DOE 's director of geothermal research , geothermal energy should provide the United States with about 5,000 megawatts of electricity ( equal to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public safety . Call it no contest against geothermal 's chief competitor , natural gas . " If we are really serious about our future , " says Dave Anderson of the National Geothermal Association , " geothermal is ready . " <p> By Dana Points <p> WINDS OF CHANGE <p> Hikers along California 's Cameron Ridge have a choice of spectacular views : To the east the Mojave stretches under a cloud-cluttered sky . To the west , on every hilltop , rows of giant pinwheels spin like hummingbirds in overdrive . This is wind power in action . <p> Born out of 1980 tax incentives , wind farms got off to a stormy start . In order to harvest time-limited credits thousands of faulty machines were rushed into action , and millions of dollars were sunk into ill-conceived projects . By 1985 the government had withdrawn incentives and cut research grants by 90 percent , Observers confidently penned obituaries for the industry . <p> Today wind power , among the cleanest and most competitive of renewable energy sources , is making a brisk comeback . " Since 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ten cents , and reliability has increased from sixty to ninety-five percent , " says Randall Swisher , executive director of the Washington-based American Wind Energy Association , In California , Pacific Gas and Electric , the state 's largest utility , will purchase most of the 2.5 billion kilowatt-hours that state wind farms are expected to produce this year . <p> For the handful of wind entrepreneurs who prevailed , the Eighties proved to be a time of trial and error . For example , once planners learned that the energy output of two machines just 100 feet apart could vary by as much as 20 percent , they began " siting " the placement of every windmill they installed , rather than grouping them . Moreover , farm operators now wash their equipment once or twice a month to clean away grime , which can reduce a turbine 's efficiency by 30 percent , <p> The industry plans greater technological fixes in the future . In one promising cooperative effort , the Electric Power Research Institute , Pacific Gas and Electric , and wind turbine manufacturer U.S , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will spin at the speed of the wind , rather than at the fixed speed of standard turbines , increasing wind capture by as much as 10 percent . Other groups aim to improve windmill efficiency through better blade design . <p> Other things to look for : advanced materials that yield lighter , stronger components , extra tall towers , and rotors that can bob up and down , in addition to moving east and west in pursuit of the wind . These improvements should reduce the costs of wind electricity to about five cents per kilowatt-hour by the mid-Nineties . According to DOE estimates , costs should drop even more in the next 20 years . <p> Even so , while the technical problems are solvable , wind power could use a little help from Uncle Sam , says Robert Jans , an energy consultant in Byron , California . Government funding for the development of wind turbine technology in Europe is currently estimated to exceed U.S. federal support ten times .
