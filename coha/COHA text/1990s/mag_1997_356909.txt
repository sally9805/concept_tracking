RUPERT 'S CABLE COMPROMISE <P> In the satellite business , just as in real estate , location is everything . So when Rupert Murdoch ended up with satellite slots at 110degrees west longitude , he knew he had the equivalent of a condo in Malibu . The position offers panoramic views of the U.S. <P> But finding the right thing to do with the real estate was surprisingly difficult . Murdoch 's ambition  --  to build a global carpet of satellite dishes  --  requires a partner to deliver programming to American homes . In February he announced plans to buy a 50% stake in EchoStar , a start-up that owns birds at 119degrees . That deal cratered earlier this month , so Murdoch cut a tentative agreement with his adversaries in the cable industry . He may give up rights to his slots in return for nonvoting shares of PrimeStar , the satellite company that includes TCI and Time Warner . He failed to force the cable guys to carry all his programming , but he will get greater distribution . The cable giants get a slice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rough neighborhood , though : market leader DirectTV lives at 101degrees . <P> YOU SANK MY BATTLE CHIP ! <P> Digital CEO Robert Palmer must have known that picking a fight with Intel might start an all-out war . Last week he got one . <P> Two weeks after Digital sued Intel , claiming patent infringement , the microchip giant struck back with a devastating suit of its own , charging that Digital was misusing confidential information . Worse , Intel  --  which sold an estimated $150 million of chips to Digital in 1996  --  threatened to choke off the vital supply . Wrote general counsel F. Thomas Dunlap : " It 's unreasonable to think the relationship ... can remain the same . " In other words , let 's starve the s.o.b.s . <P> Intel , meanwhile , is battling more significant problems . On Friday the firm warned that second-quarter earnings were likely to be softer than expected . In response , the stock stumbled 7% . But insiders say the company is still seeing impressively strong orders for its new Pentium II chips . Given Intel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect a rebound . The champ , Digital is learning , is still the champ . <P> SMOKIN ' JOE CAMEL NEAR HIS LAST GASP <P> He 's cool . He 's suave . And soon smokin ' Joe Camel may also be history . In a 3-to-2 vote last week , the Federal Trade Commission charged that R.J. Reynolds violated federal laws by using Joe to hawk cigarettes to kids . The surprise decision , which reversed a 1994 ruling , was based on internal Reynolds documents that suggest Camel relied on Joe to boost its share of the under-18 market , which has leaped to more than 13% since 1987 , when Joe Camel was first introduced in the U.S. ; Camel 's share of the youth smoking market was then less than 3% . Later this month , the ftc will try to put teeth in its ruling by persuading a court to ban the ad everywhere except in bars and nightclubs , places it hopes even smoking teens wo n't be . <P> MICHAEL JORDAN SMELLS MONEY <P> Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan did n't win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utah 's Karl Malone . But Jordan could claim another kind of MVP , as in Most Valuable Perfume . His Airness 's first shot at fragrances , Michael Jordan cologne , is a swish , with sales flying over $60 million in its first six months .
