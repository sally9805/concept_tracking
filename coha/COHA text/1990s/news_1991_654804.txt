<p> IT 's Saturday noon . I 'm back from the office ( we work six days in Beijing ) , and after a quick lunch I 'll take off on my Flying Pigeon bicycle to meet Zhou Fan , our nine-year-old granddaughter , at the bus stop . She 's coming to our house from her boarding school and has to change buses at a busy intersection . I escort her across two main streets and onto the next bus back to our home . It 's a cold day ; the wicked wind from the north ( Siberia or Mongolia , I 'm not sure which ) is sending people scurrying . <p> I get out my old black corduroy padded shoes , faded down jacket , and thick-knitted mittens . No telling how long I 'll have to wait for the buses , and the ride itself can be one cold blast . I arrive early at the bus stop . So far , so good . Last week , Zhou Fan got there first - no waipo ( maternal grandmother ) . I vowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small figure rushes toward me , warm jacket flying open , no mittens , or cloth sandals . I ask about mittens , and Zhou Fan shows me how her sleeves are so long she really does n't need mittens . Like most Chinese children , she 's wearing a jacket several sizes too big ; sometimes one sees very small children with sleeves practically dragging on the ground . The theory is for jackets and shoes to be big enough to last several years , but I imagine they wear out long before they reach their proper fit . I put Zhou Fan 's dirty-clothes bag under the clip on the back of the bike , the book bag in the basket in front , and off we set on our street crossings to the next bus stop . <p> Zhou Fan is chattering irrepressibly , full of week-at-school events ; I catch only a scrap here and there ( my Chinese still far from fluent ) , pushing the bike and making what I hope are appropriate responses . There 's something about the harmonica the teacher was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oh yes , the essay she wrote last week after we went to the farmers ' market together and loaded up our bikes with bargain-price fruits and vegetables . That time she rode on the back of her auntie 's bike , since the market is just across from the Big Bell Temple , not far from our home . I thought her essay was quite good , but my admiration for anyone able to write in Chinese , especially at such a young age , is boundless . <p> We 've successfully made it across the first big street when I hear Zhou Fan singing a familiar tune , one that takes me back to December in the United States . " We wish you a merry Christmas ; we wish you a merry Christmas ; we wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year ! " Her English-language teacher is obviously keeping an eye on the calendar . We both sing lustily now , dodging bicyclists to reach the next curb , then on to the next big street , where a policeman is signaling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never having yet figured out a Chinese traffic cop 's signals , I wait for the lights and a break in the steady flow of cars , trucks , buses , and bicycles to make our way safely across to the next bus stop . <p> Bus 323 is nowhere in sight , so Zhou Fan has time to eat the candy and bananas her waigong ( maternal grandfather ) tucked into my pocket for her . ( Candy during the week at school is strictly forbidden . ) The bus seems to be taking its time and a goodly crowd gathers at the stop . Zhou Fan suggests I go on ahead , but I like to see her safely aboard . When I 'm there , I figure , the usual brutal boarding of Beijing buses may ease up a bit . I 've even seen a helping hand reach out to get her up the steps of the always overcrowded bus . <p> Zhou Fan is impatient and now suggests we walk to the next stop . I 'm afraid we 'll miss the bus - if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Merry Christmas " and bucking the wind , which nearly stops us in our tracks at times . Surprisingly , we make it to the next stop before the bus arrives . <p> I see her securely on , just scraping past the closing doors , then speed off on the Flying Pigeon . When I turn into our compound about 20 minutes later , I spot her small figure sauntering along ahead of me . The jacket we had zippered and the hood we had tied are swinging wide again . This Chinese child is not to be bound in , whatever the temperature . We sing our way home . <p> Softly , softly Zhou Fan opens the door , so as not to waken her waigong from his postprandial nap . But we 've taken so long that he 's already up . We greet him with a rendition of " Merry Christmas " and our weekend with Zhou Fan begins . <p> Our granddaughter comes from a small town in Hunan Province . I acquired her , her uncles , cousins , aunts , parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extended Chinese family ( the nuclear family is nonexistent in China ) when I married her waigong , a Beijing journalist from a Hunan family . An only child under China 's family-planning scheme , Zhou Fan , like all the other only children in China , is doted upon and given the best of everything , so far as possible . <p> The best education was not to be had in her small town . Her parents , both from a generation brought up in perilous times and thus severely deprived academically , felt a good education was of the utmost importance . She came to Beijing to attend boarding school five and a half days a week . Early Monday morning her waigong takes the two-bus trip back to school with her . She has a Beijing residence permit now , but neither of her parents do , so she had to come to the city alone . Her mother was born in Beijing , but during the Cultural Revolution ( 1966-76 ) she was sent as a middle-school student to Inner Mongolia to work in a youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Beijing , overcrowded , is wary of granting residence permits . HER father , Baba , took the parting with his child the hardest . Both parents <p> came to Beijing to see her safely installed , then Baba went back to his job . Several times we saw tears in his eyes . <p> Zhou Fan 's school is on the outskirts of Beijing and was set up primarily for Army " brats . " It 's one of only two boarding schools in the city and we had to do a bit of finagling to get her in . <p> Since the school 's in a military area ( although it seems to be used only for officers ' homes ) , foreigners can not enter , but I went on a special excursion to the area one Sunday ( actually , it 's considered one of Beijing 's " scenic spots " ) . Zhou Fan showed me her classroom ( through the door 's window ) and dormitory building . She 's quite happy there . She was most impressed the first week by how polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , she said , the boys were always beat-ing each other up and no one was ever polite . It 's a poor town - factory workers and erstwhile farmers - and the education level is not high . I found it drab and rather dismal , although the people were friendly enough . <p> In Beijing , we have more " cultural " activities and Zhou Fan 's mother , like mothers everywhere , is anxious that Zhou Fan partake . I got tickets for everyone ( her mother was still here then ) to a performance of Beethoven 's Ninth , and it was the first time Zhou Fan had ever been in a concert hall . She left the house with my field glasses , in case the seats were far back . They turned out to be right over the stage and everyone was delighted to be able to watch the conductor and see the instruments and singers up close . Zhou Fan did n't fall asleep either , which is now a problem sometimes , since she has gotten into the habit at school of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six ) . <p> That night , Zhou Fan slept on the floor of our room and the next morning was busy writing something . Not her homework , it turned out ( she 'd finished that the day before ) , but a letter to her father . It was quite long and when she 'd finished , she read it to us . Really a good letter , but I found something missing : not one word about Beethoven , supposedly the highlight of her week . I asked her why . " Oh , I forgot ! " <p> Deflated , I thought back over her letter to see what was the highlight of her week . The big , important event she wanted to tell her father about was her trip back from school on the public bus when she and several classmates , one by one , gave up their seats to elderly women as they boarded the bus . ( The bus starts at their school , so they all originally had seats . ) That way they were all " little Lei Fengs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always doing good deeds for others and never thought of himself first . He became a model - China is big on models - some years ago , and after the " turmoil " in 1989 , government leaders could find no better model than Lei Feng to put before the youth , so he was resurrected . For Zhou Fan and her classmates - but not for university students - the model seems to be working . <p> Now Zhou Fan 's aunt and uncle have arrived , on their way home from work . Originally , the idea was for Zhou Fan to spend the weekend with them , but their house , not far away , is heated by only a small coal stove and the coal has been of such poor quality the last year or so that it 's always cold there . Besides , they have no hot water except what they heat on the gas cooker , so baths ( in a wash basin there , in a tub here ) , and the weekly clothes washing are better handled here . Zhou Fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , plays to the grandstand . <p> She 's normally a bright , helpful , thoughtful child , and when she 's alone with us , she 's quite natural . I was noticing some Canadian children the other day , and it struck me how much more " adult " and self-assertive they were . Zhou Fan , like most Chinese children , is still a child , still protected , although I 'm often amused by her adult expressions at the dinner table , in obvious imitation of her parents . I can still talk with her , however , about such things as what her favorite toy bear ( brought to her from the United States ) does at school on weekends while she 's away ( the bear plays with the other children 's animals , Zhou Fan says ) . Her teacher says she listens to what she says , the Chinese way of saying she 's an obedient child . <p> Right now I hear her voice in the other room reading aloud to her admiring family . She stops and comes to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The program we 've been looking forward to on TV is beginning . <p> Three generations line up on the bed to watch Beijing Opera stars put on a gala performance . Beijing Opera is supposedly going through hard times , unable to hold its audiences these days - the young people find it boring - but we all like it . I do n't understand the words , of course , but how many Western operas does anyone understand ? The way the singers ' voices modulate around the syllables and musical notes always makes me think of good jazz singers - it 's the same principle . BEFORE long , aunt and uncle leave and Zhou Fan curls up on the floor next to our bed to sleep . I 'm always first up , so it 's some time the next morning before I hear , " I wish you a Merry Christmas " coming from behind the bedroom door . I enter singing and find her carefully folding up her quilts the way she 's been taught at school . Then she and waigong eat breakfast together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions of what appear to be quite abstruse subjects . ( I found out later she was asking him , a specialist in nature writing , where animals came from and why their paws were n't like our hands . ) They 're both happy as clams to have an audience . <p> Homework follows - reciting the English alphabet ( they do it together , being at about the same level ) and the phrases she 's learned by rote : " How do you do ? I 'm fine . " Then it 's " Let 's sing a happy song to see the new year in " and we 're off once again on " Merry Christmas . " <p> We all go to the bus stop and Zhou Fan , wearing the new padded pink-and-white sport shoes I bought her , a bit large , by order of her aunt , hops on alone . Quickly a hand reaches down to help her on . It 's a young woman in Army uniform spending her Sunday being a good Lei Feng . Aunt and uncle will meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take her shopping and to see in-law relatives , then she 'll be back for the night and the early-morning trip with waigong back to school .
