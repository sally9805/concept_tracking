For The Chairman , The Joint Chiefs OfStaff : Forbes T. Willis Forbes T. Willis Brigadier General , USMC Executive Officer , JCS TOP SECRET Chapter Two Brussels , Belgium 1320 Hours 11 November 1964 Brigadier General Harris McCord , USAF , thought he had yet another proof , if one were needed , that life was full of little ironies . Sixteen hours before , he had been at the USMC Birthday Ball at the Hotel Continental in Paris , tripping the light fantastic with his wife . He had been wearing his mess dress uniform , complete with real medals rather than ribbons , and with more silver embellishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engage in what promised to be a really hairy exercise , he was wearing a somewhat baggy tweed jacket and well-worn flannel slacks . Just before he had left Paris , he had been told to wear civilian clothing . What he had on was all that had come back from the dry cleaners . There were five peers , most of whom he knew , at least by sight , all in civilian clothing in a none-too-fancy conference room in the U.S. Embassy , waiting for Colonel Sanford T. Felter and his staff . The whole damned continent had been socked in , and Felter 's plane had had to sit down in Scotland to wait for Brussels to clear to bare minimums . He had heard of Felter , but he had never seen him in person and he was not very impressed with him when he walked into the room . Felter was small and slight , and wearing a baggy gray suit . He looked like a stereotype of a middle-level bureaucrat . " Sorry to keep you waiting , gentlemen , " Felter said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a key from his pocket and unlocked the padlock that had chained-more accurately , steel-cabled-it to his wrist . " My name is McCord , Colonel , " General McCord said , and went to Felter and offered his hand . " I 'm glad you were available , General , " Felter said . As the others introduced themselves to Felter , McCord considered that . Felter knew who he was , and there was an implication that he had asked for him by name . That was flattering , unless you were rank-conscious , and thought that general officers should pick colonels , rather than the other way around . " I think the best way to handle this , gentlemen , " Felter began , " is to give you a quick recap of what 's going on in the Congo , specifically in Stanleyville , and then to tell you what we intend to try to do to set it right . " There are 1,600 people , Europeans , white people , held captive by Olenga 's Simbas in Stanleyville . A four-column relief force-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Frederick Van de Waele of the Belgian Army has been charged with suppressing the rebellion , which includes , of course , the recapture of Stanleyville . " There have been some successes , as you probably know from your own sources , but there is no way that Van de Waele can make it to Stanleyville before the end of the month . That poses two problems . The first is the rebels ' announced intention to kill the hostages , a threat we consider bona fide , before Van de Waele can get to them . " The second is that we have hard intelligence that since 20 October , at least two , and probably as many as four , unmarked Ilyushin-18 turboprop aircraft have been flying arms and ammunition into the Arau airbase in northern Uganda , from Algeria . Should they decide to do so , it would be easy for them to move the arms and ammunition to Olenga 's forces . The possibility of their doing so , it is believed , increases as Van de Waele 's mercenaries and ANC troops approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Belgian premier , Spaak , that the first priority is to keep those 1,600 people alive . The Belgians have made available the First Parachutist Battalion of their Paracommando Regiment . I 'm familiar with it . The First Battalion was trained by the British Special Air Service people in World War II , and they pride themselves now on being just as good . The regiment is commanded by Colonel Charles Laurent , who is a fine officer , and who I suspect will lead the First Battalion himself . " They will be carried to Stanleyville in USAF C-130 aircraft . After the airfield is softened up with some B-26s , they will make a parachute landing and seize the airport . Part of the force will remain at the airport to make the airport ready to receive the C-130s , and the balance will enter Stanleyville , find the Europeans , and bring them to the airport . They will be loaded aboard the C-130s and then everybody leaves . No attempt will be made to hold Stanleyville . I do n't want any questions right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " These gentlemen , " Felter went on , turning to indicate the men he had brought with him , " are Lieutenant Colonel Lowell , Captain Stacey , Lieutenant Foster , and Sergeant Portet . They 're Green Berets . Colonel Lowell is on the Strike staff , and wrote Dragon Rouge . Captain Stacey and the others have been practicing a somewhat smaller operation intended for Stanleyville , now called off . But they know the town , and rebel dispositions and the probable location of the Europeans , and I brought them along to share their expertise . " The light colonel , Lowell , General McCord thought , looks like a bright guy , if not much like a Green Beret . Stacey looks like a typical young Green Beret captain , a hard charger , tough , mean , and lean . The black lieutenant , Foster , looks as if he could chew railroad spikes and spit tacks . The sergeant . . . there 's something wrong with him : His face is scratched and blotchy and swollen . He can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his face is also wrong with his hands . " Colonel Lowell , " Felter went on , " as soon as we wind it up here , will be available to explain any questions you might have about the OPPLAN for Dragon Rouge . Stacey and Foster are going to go liaise with the Belgians . " Felter looked at General McCord . " I 'm going to give Sergeant Portet , to you , General . He 's a former airlines pilot , with extensive experience in the Congo-including , of course , Kamina and Stanleyville-and equally important , because he was involved in getting the B-26- Ks to the Congo , he knows most , if not all , the Cubans who will be flying them . " A former airlines pilot ? McCord wondered . What 's he doing in the army as a sergeant ? A Green Beret sergeant ? " Glad to have all the help I can get , " McCord said . He had another thought : I wonder if " the airlines pilot " caught whatever is wrong with his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's contagious ? Felter looked around the room . " I have rough OPPLANs here . Study them overnight , and be prepared to offer fixes for what is wrong with the OPPLAN tomorrow morning . " He paused , then went on . " That will be all for now , gentlemen . Thank you . But keep yourselves available . " Felter and three of the three Green Berets started to leave the room . Lowell opened a well-stuffed briefcase . Felter caught the sergeant 's attention and nodded toward General McCord . The sergeant went to General McCord . " Colonel Felter said I am to make myself useful , sir , " he said . McCord resisted the temptation to offer his hand . " You 've been into Stanleyville , Sergeant ? Flown into Stanleyville ? " " Yes , sir . " " Purely as a matter of idle curiosity , I 've looked at the Jepp charts , " General McCord said . " I know we can get 130s in there . " " Yes , sir , easily . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How many will it take at once ? " Portet 's swollen face wrinkled in thought . " No more than six at once , sir , " he said . " To be safe , I would say no more than five . There 's not much of paved tarmac , and the unpaved areas wo n't take the weight of a C-130 . " " Colonel Felter said you were an airline pilot ? " The rest of the question went unspoken , but Sergeant Portet answered , smiling wryly . " I got a postcard from my friends and neighbors at the draft board , General . " Then , as if he was no longer able to resist an awful temptation , he put his hand up and scratched at the open blotches his face-with a hand that was similarly disfigured with suppurating sores . " What 's wrong with your face , son ? " General McCord asked . " And your hand ? " " It 's nothing , sir . A little rash . " " A little rash , my ass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been that way ? " " It started on the plane from the States , sir , " Jack said . " It 's some kind of an allergy , probably . Nothing to worry about . " " Where were you in the States ? Bragg ? " " Yes , sir . " " Come with me , Sergeant , " McCord said . He had seen the military attach 's office on the way to the conference room , and he led Jack there . There was a captain on duty , who glanced up and was not very impressed with what he saw . Two messy Americans in mussed clothing , one of them with what looked like a terminal case of scabies on his face . " Yes ? " he asked . " I 'm General McCord , " McCord said , which caused the captain to come to his feet and to stand to attention . " Yes , sir . " " Would you be good enough to get me the commanding officer of the nearest U.S. military medical facility on the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll be all right . I do n't want to get put in a hospital now . " " I expected as much from a Green Beret , " McCord said . " But I would be very surprised if they 'll let you get on the airplanes , much less jump on Stanleyville . It looks to me as if the whole purpose of the Belgians is to keep Americans out of it . " " My stepmother and stepsister are in Stanleyville , General . I 'm going in . " McCord looked at him . Before he could frame a reply , the captain handed him a telephone . " Colonel Aspen , sir . " " Colonel , this is General McCord . This may sound a little odd , but I want you to dispatch , immediately , one of your best medical officers . I am in the U.S. Embassy , and I have a young sergeant with me who , if my diagnosis is correct , has been rolling around in poison oak . " There was a pause . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to argue about this . I expect to see either you or one of your doctors here within twenty minutes . " He hung the phone up , and turned to smile at Jack . " They give you a shot , " he said . " It clears it up in a couple of hours . I had it in survival school in Utah a couple of years ago . " " Thank you very much , sir , " Jack said . " Do n't get your hopes up about anything else , Sergeant , " General McCord said . " I know they wo n't let you jump on Stanleyville . " " Yes , sir , " Jack said . " So tell me what else I should know about the airport in Stanleyville , " General McCord said . Chapter Three Stanleyville , Republic of the Congo 0600 25 November 1964 As a tradition , the men of the First Battalion , the Paracommando Regiment , Royal Belgian Army , continued to use the English-language jump commands the battalion had learned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand UP ! " the jumpmaster ordered . The two outside files of men inside the USAF C-130 , called " Chalk One " in the OPPLAN , stood up and folded up their nylon and aluminum pole seats back against the fuselage wall . " Inboard sticks , stand UP ! " The two inside files rose to their feet and folded their seats . " Hook UP ! " Everybody fastened the hook at the end of their static line to a steel cable . " Check static lines ! Check equipment ! " Everybody tugged at his own static line , to make sure it was securely hooked to the cable , and then they checked the harness and other equipment of the man standing in front of them-that is to say , in the lines that now faced rear , and led to the exit doors on either side of the aircraft . Now the jumpmaster switched to French : " Un minute ! " and then back to English : " Stand in the door ! " Chalk One was down to 700 feet or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retarded , close ( at 125 mph ) to stall speed . " Go ! " Sergeant Jack Portet , wearing the uniform of a Belgian paratrooper , was the sixth man in the port-side stick . The Belgians had been sympathetic to someone who wanted to jump on Stanleyville because his mother and sister were there . And if he got into trouble with the U.S. Army , c'est la vie . Jack felt the slight tug of the static line almost immediately after exiting the aircraft , and a moment later , felt his main chute slithering out of the case . And then the canopy filled , and he had a sensation of being jerked upward . There was not enough time to orient himself beyond seeing the airfield beneath and slightly to the left of him , and to pick out the twelve-story , white Immoquateur apartment building downtown before the ground seemed to suddenly rush up at him . He knew where he was now . He landed on the tee of the third hole of the Stanleyville golf course . He landed on his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to dump a little air from the nearly emptied canopy , there was a sudden gust of air and the canopy filled and pulled him off his feet . He hit the quick release and was out of the harness a moment later . He rolled over and saw that the sky was full of chutes from Chalk Two and Chalk Three . And then there were peculiar whistling noises , and peculiar cracking noises , and after a moment Jack realized that he was under fire . And there did n't seem to be anybody to shoot back at . And then , all of a sudden , there was : There were Simbas firing from , of all places , the control tower . He dropped to the ground , worked the action of the FN assault rifle , and took aim at the tower . As he lined his sights up , the tower disappeared in a cloud of dust . In a moment , he had the explanation . Two paratroopers had gotten their machine guns in action . Jack got to his feet and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation , either something captured here , or the jeeps or the odd-looking three-wheelers on the C-130s that were supposed to land , the officers would get first crack at it . And he wanted to be there when it arrived . He had to get to the Immoquateur , and he needed wheels to do that . A sergeant drove up in a white pickup with a Mobil Oil Pegasus painted on its doors . One of the Belgian officers looked around and then pointed to Jack . " That one , l'Americain , knows the town . Put half a dozen men in the back , and make a reconnaissance by fire . " And then he made his little joke . " You better hope you get killed , " he said to Jack . " When Le Grand Noir , " The Big Black , " by which he meant , of course , Lieutenant Foster was looking for you and could n't find you , he said if you jumped with us , he was going to pull your legs and arms off , one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of the Mobil Oil pickup , holding the FN in one hand . But he was suddenly very frightened . Not of fighting , or even of dying , but of what he was liable to find when he got to the Immoquateur . They first encountered resistance three hundred yards down the road , just past the Sabena Guest House . A Simba wrapped in an animal skin , with a pistol in one hand , a sword in the other , charged at them down the middle of the road . Behind him came three others , armed with FN assault rifles , firing them on full automatic . The pickup truck screeched to a halt . Jack went onto his belly , his rifle to his shoulder . As he found a target , baffled to see that the Simba 's weapon was firing straight up into the air , there was a short burst of 7-mm fire over his head . The Simba with the sword stopped in midstride and then crumpled to his knees . Before he fell over , a torrent of blood gushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the fallen man in absolute surprise . Then they stopped shooting and started to back up . There was another burst of the fire from the pickup , this time from several weapons . Two of the three Simbas fell down , one of them backward . The remaining Simba , the one in Jack 's sights , dropped his rifle and ran away with great loping strides . There was another burst of fire from the truck , no more than four rounds from a paratrooper 's assault rifle . The Simba took two more steps , then fell on his face to the left . Jack scrambled to his knees and turned to look for the truck . It was already moving . He jumped onto the running board as it came past , almost losing his balance as the driver swerved , unsuccessfully , to avoid running over the Simba who had led the charge with a sword . There was a furious horn bleating behind them , and the pickup pulled off the shoulder of the road . A jeep raced past them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in short bursts , at targets Jack could not see . The pickup swerved back onto the paved surface , almost throwing Jack off . There was the sound of a great many weapons being fired , but none of the fire seemed directed at them . They reached the first houses . There were more Simbas in sight now , but none of them were attacking . They were in the alleys between the houses , and in the streets behind them . The jeep that had raced past them was no longer in sight , but Jack could still hear the peculiar sound of the Browning firing in short bursts . The Mobil Oil pickup truck came to an intersection and stopped . Jack looked at the driver . " You 're supposed to be the fucking expert , " the driver said to him . " Where do we go ? " " Right , " Jack ordered , without really thinking about it . The Immoquateur was to the right . The pickup jerked into motion . Fifty yards down the road , they came across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , and a twelve- or thirteen-year-old boy , sprawled dead in pools of blood in the road , obviously shot as they had tried to run . Jack felt nausea rise in his throat , but managed to hold it down . Ahead , over the roofs of the pleasant , pastel-painted villas , he saw the white bulk of the Immoquateur . Then there was fire directed at them . The pickup screeched to a stop in the middle of the street . Jack felt himself going , tried valiantly to stop himself , and then , bouncing off the fender , fell onto the pavement , on his face . He felt his eyes water , and then they lost focus . Jesus Christ ! I 've been shot ! He shook his head , then put his hand to his face . There was something warm on it . Blood ! I 've been shot in the face ! He sat up . Someone rushed up to him . Indistinctly , he made out one of the paratroopers leaning over him , felt his fingers on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all right , " he said . " All you 've got is a bloody nose . " He slapped Jack on the back and ran ahead of him . Jack 's eyes came back into focus . He looked at his lap and saw blood dripping into it . He looked around and saw his assault rifle on the street , six feet from where he was sitting . He scurried on his knees to it , picked it up , fired a burst in the air to make sure it was still functioning , and then looked around again , this time at the Immoquateur . There were bodies on the lawn between the street and the shops on the ground floor . Simba and European . He got to his feet and ran toward the Immoquateur . Jack recognized one of the more than a dozen bodies on the lawn before the Immoquateur . It was the Stanleyville station manager of the Congo River Steamship Company . He had met him when they had shipped in a truck . He had been shot in the neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shotgun . The stout , gray-haired woman lying beside him , an inch-wide hole in her forehead , was almost certainly his wife . Jack ran into the building itself . There were two dead Simbas in the narrow elevator corridor . One of them had most of his head blown away . The other , shot as he came out of the elevator , had taken a burst in the chest . It had literally blown a hole through his body . Parts of his ribs , or his spine , some kind of bone , were sticking at awkward angles out his back . He was lying in the open elevator door . The door of the elevator tried to close on his body , encountered it , reopened , and then tried to close again . Jack laid his FN assault rifle against the wall , put his hands on the dead man 's neck , and dragged him free . The elevator door closed , a melodious chime bonged , and the elevator started up . " Shit ! " Jack went to the call button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not illuminate . He ran farther down the corridor and pushed the service elevator call button . It lit up , but there was no sound of elevator machinery . He went back to wait for the first elevator . One of the Belgian paratroopers from the pickup truck came into the corridor , in a crouch , his rifle ready . " The sergeant said you are to come back to the truck , " he said . " Fuck him , my mother 's upstairs , " Jack said . The Belgian paratrooper ran back out of the building . The elevator indicator showed that it was on the ninth floor . Then it started to come down . The Belgian paratrooper came running back into the building . Jack wondered if he was going to give him any trouble . " I got a radio , " the Belgian said . " They are leaving us . " Jack felt something warm on his hand , looked down and saw blood . The elevator mechanism chimed pleasantly , and the door opened . Jack stepped over the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as Jack pushed the floor button . The door closed and the elevator started to rise . It stopped at the fourth floor . A Simba in parts of a Belgian officer 's uniform did not have time to raise his pistol before a burst from Jack 's assault rifle smashed into his midsection . The noise in the closed confines of the elevator was painful and dazzling . Jack 's ears rang to the point where he knew he would not be able to hear anything but the loudest of sounds for a long time . The paratrooper with Jack jumped , in a crouch , into the corridor and let loose a burst down the corridor . It was empty . The Simba he had shot had backed into the corridor wall and then slid to the floor , leaving a foot-wide track of blood down the wall . Jack thought he saw life leave the Simba 's eyes . He took the Simba 's pistol , a World War II-era German Luger , from his hand , stuffed it into the chest pocket of his tunic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it after him . The chime sounded melodiously again , the doors closed , and the elevator started up again . When the door opened , they were on the tenth floor . There was no one there . Neither Jack nor the paratrooper moved . The chime sounded again , and the door closed . Jack reached out with the muzzle of his FN and rapped the rubber edge of the door . The door started to open again . Jack , copying what the paratrooper had done on the fourth floor , jumped , in a crouch , into the corridor . But the corridor was empty . Jack ran to the door of the Air Simba apartment . It was battered , as if someone had tried to batter his way in , and there were bullet holes in it . He put his hand on the doorknob . The door was locked . He banged on it with his fist . " Hanni ! " he shouted . " Hanni , c'est moi ! C'est Jacques ! " There was no answer . He raised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area of the knob . The butt snapped off behind the trigger assembly . He felt tears well up in his eyes . He pulled the trigger to see if it would still work , and there was another painful roar of sound , and a cloud of cement dust as the bullets struck the ceiling . He raised his boot and kicked at the door beside the knob with all his might . There was a splintering sound , and the lock mechanism tore free . Jack kicked it again , and it flew open . The Belgian paratrooper , in his now- familiar crouching stance , rushed into the apartment . There was not the expected burst of fire . Jack ran into the room . Hanni was standing in front of the bedroom door , white-faced . " Bonjour , madame , " the Belgian paratrooper said . Hanni saw Jack . " Oh , my God ! It is you ! I thought I was losing my mind ! " " Hanni ! " Jack croaked . The bedroom door opened . Jeanine appeared . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . Black . Wearing an animal skin . " Do n't shoot ! " Hanni screamed . " He 's a friend ! " " Jacques , do n't ! " Jeanine said when Jack trained what was left of the FN at him . " Who the hell is he ? " " Captain George Washington Lunsford , " the man in the animal skin said , " United States Army , at your service , sir . " He walked into the room with his hands above his shoulders . " Jacques , for God 's sake , " Hanni said , " he saved our lives . Put the gun down . " Jack saw Ursula Craig holding her baby in her arms in the bedroom . Beside her , a large knife in each hand , was an enormous , very black woman . " Mon Dieu , " the black woman said . " C'est Jacques ! " Jack went to the bedroom . Mary Magdalene dropped the knives and enveloped him in massive black arms . As her huge body heaved with sobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over , " Mon petit Jacques , mon petit Jacques . " " I hate to break that up , " Lunsford said , " but there are savages all over the building , and I 'd feel a lot more comfortable if I had my rifle . " Jack freed himself . " You okay , Ursula ? " " I am now , " she said . Jack turned to Lunsford . " Captain , I heard there were Green Beanies here , but I did n't expect to find one dressed like that . " " He knew what the Simbas would do once they saw the paratroopers , " Hanni said . " He came to protect us . " " I was undercover . If I go get my rifle , " Lunsford said , nodding at the Belgian paratrooper , " does he know what 's going on , or . . . " " Je suis votre service , mon capitain , " the Belgian paratrooper said , coming to attention , and then added , almost as if he was embarrassed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bedroom and came back with his rifle . " That radio work ? " he asked . " Oui , mon capitain , " the Belgian said . " Then you get on it , and tell somebody important where we are , and to come fetch us , " Lunsford ordered . " Oui , mon capitain , " the Belgian paratrooper said . " You close the door , " Lunsford ordered Jack . " We 'll put the ladies back in the bedroom until the cavalry gets here . " " Yes , sir , " Jack said .
