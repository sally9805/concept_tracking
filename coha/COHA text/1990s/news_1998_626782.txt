<p> For the majority of NASCAR fans who would like to see someone , anyone , besides Jeff Gordon win the Winston Cup championship this year , we will give you the good news first . <p> Four other drivers have a legitimate shot at winning the title this season . <p> Now for the bad news . With the 1998 season just past the halfway point , Gordon is on top of the points standings again and remains the man to catch . <p> " That kid in the 24 car , " as Dale Earnhardt calls him . " He 's the mark to beat . " <p> With 17 of 33 races completed , NASCAR has experienced a little bit of everything this season . Things started on a high note with Earnhardt finally getting that elusive first Daytona 500 victory . <p> But the same track was the site of the low point of the season five months later when wildfires in Florida forced NASCAR officials to postpone the Pepsi 400 , an event that was going to be the first race shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In between those two occurrences , there have been a lot of surprises along the way . Jeremy Mayfield has moved up to contender status on the Cup circuit ; the track at Texas Motor Speedway has been rebuilt ; and a rising star with a familiar name has emerged in the Busch Grand National Series - Dale Earnhardt Jr . <p> Maybe in a year or two , the younger version of The Intimidator will be a challenger to Gordon , because the days of Junior 's dad being able to compete for a title may be over . In the last 76 Cup races over three seasons , Earnhardt Sr. has one victory . Gordon has 24 . <p> Gordon hopes to add to that total in the second half of the season . This weekend is the final break before the drivers race for 16 consecutive weeks to decide the 1998 championship . <p> " You take a deep breath and try to regroup for the rest of the year , " Gordon said . " When you have a good first half , it kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four victories , five poles and 11 top-10 finishes this year , it does n't look like Gordon needs much additional motivation . But he will need to keep up the pace in the DuPont Monte Carlo if he hopes to win his third championship in the past four years . <p> Last season was the closest three-way finish in history when Gordon edged Dale Jarrett by 14 points ( 4,710 to 4,696 ) and Mark Martin by 29 points . <p> All three drivers went to the final race at Atlanta with a chance to win the title , and this season could have a similar finish . Three drivers are within 137 points ( less than a one-race difference ) of Gordon . Martin is 52 points back ( 2,527 to 2,475 ) , and Jarrett is 46 points behind Martin . <p> Mayfield trails by 137 points in the fourth spot , and teammate Rusty Wallace remains within striking distance at 220 points behind Gordon in the No. 5 spot . <p> " I think the championship is as wide-open as it has even been , " Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look too far ahead . We 've got a lot of races to go . " <p> No one has come closer to the title without winning it than Martin . The 39-year-old Arkansas native has finished in the top six in each of the past nine seasons , including second place twice and third place three times . In 1990 , he fell just 26 points short of Earnhardt . <p> " I can just about taste it , " said Martin , who drives the Valvoline Taurus . " We 've been so close that I know what it feels like to have a shot at it . <p> " I 've had my heart broken in this sport a lot more times than I 've experienced overwhelming joy . But we know we have awesome equipment , and we just have to keep coming up with strong finishes . Then , we will see where we are at the end . " <p> Jarrett , who drives the Quality Care Taurus , has been in the battle at the end the past two years , finishing third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41 , Jarrett knows what it takes to stay in contention . <p> " You have some really good teams with drivers that are hungry for a championship , " Jarrett said . " I think the next five or six races will show who is going to be there down the stretch . <p> " Every team in the top five has had slumps this year , and the teams that can show the most consistency over the rest of the summer are the ones that will have a shot at it . You ca n't afford many bad weeks . " <p> Mayfield has n't had many bad weeks this season , but he had one last weekend at New Hampshire when he finished 30th after an accident . It was the first time this season Mayfield had failed to finish in the top 25 . The 29-year-old Kentucky product has 10 finishes in the top 10 , including eight in the top five . <p> Mayfield , who drives the Mobil 1 Taurus , earned his first Cup victory in the Pocono 500 on June 21 . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several weeks , and he clearly has benefited from the alignment with Wallace in forming the Penske/Kranefuss team . <p> " I knew there would be some ups and downs in a long season , " Mayfield said . " But with all these races in a row , you ca n't get too high or too low . You just have to move on and try to stay consistent . <p> " A lot of guys have told me that once you get the taste of that first win , you 'll never be satisfied with second again . Well , I never was satisfied with second before we won . " <p> Gordon feels the same way , but at age 26 he has won more races in less time than any driver on the circuit . <p> " To me , every race I do n't win is a disappointment , " Gordon said . " There are many more disappointments than victories in this sport . But you know you are working for something special - the championship . It 's not a great race car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone on the team coming together for a common goal . " <p> <p> NASCAR at midseason <p> Best moment <p> Dale Earnhardt finally getting that elusive victory in his 20th try at the Daytona 500 . <p> <p> Worst luck <p> NASCAR and Daytona International Speedway officials having to postpone the Pepsi 400 because of the wildfires in Florida . The event was going to be the first Winston Cup race shown in prime time on a major network , but it 's unlikely CBS will carry the race on the new date of Oct. 17 . <p> <p> Best decision <p> Texas Motor Speedway owner Bruton Smith deciding to reconstruct the track after Winston Cup drivers complained again about problems with the racing surface . The repaving and reconstruction process cost more than $ 2 million , but the improvements will be worth it if TMS gets a second annual date in the Cup schedule . <p> <p> Biggest surprise <p> The success of Jeremy Mayfield , who has benefited from teaming with Rusty Wallace and has blossomed into one of the best drivers on the circuit . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few laps to go at Richmond , which was the first time NASCAR had stopped a race so it could be completed under a green flag instead of a caution . Dale Jarrett believed it cost him a victory , and he was furious when Terry Labonte bumped him from behind to get the lead and take the checkered flag . <p> <p> Best sight <p> Every member of every crew lining up on pit row to congratulate Dale Earnhardt as he headed for Victory Lane at Daytona . <p> <p> Worst accident <p> The 20-car collision at Talladega when Dale Earnhardt 's car was bumped by Ward Burton before flipping on its side and smashing into Bill Elliott . Earnhardt suffered facial burns from the fire in Elliott 's car . The crash brought about more discussion on the dangers of cars being bunched together because of restrictor plates used at Talladega and Daytona . <p> <p> Worst driver <p> Todd Bodine , who was fired after failing to qualify the Tabasco Pontiac in eight races . <p> <p> Best driver <p> Mark Martin . Most NASCAR followers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans who do n't like him . But if you ask the other drivers , the majority will tell you it 's Martin . " He 's the best out here without a doubt , " said Bobby Labonte . <p> <p> Best rookie <p> Kevin Lepage . The points total says it 's Kenny Irwin Jr. , but Lepage has done more with less . Driving a Robert Yates car that 's a proven winner ( the Texaco Ford ) , Irwin ranks 27th in 16 races , failing to qualify for one race . But Lepage ranks 37th in just 14 races while driving equipment that ca n't compare with what Irwin drives . No wonder Jack Roush signed Lepage last week .
