<p> THE CONSEQUENCES OF MASS IMMIGRATION <p> Editor  --  As a Chinese immigrant , I wish to respond to T.J. Rodgers ' letter of July 14 which argued that immigrants are economic assets . This presumably includes the hundreds of thousands of non-citizen legal immigrants who receive SSI welfare and Medicaid , costing taxpayers well over $ 10 billion in 1996 alone ! <p> Mr. Rodgers , like many other executives in Silicon Valley , promotes mass immigration but refuses to accept one of the many consequences of exponential population growth driven in large part by continued large scale immigration : growing congestion . <p> Studies claiming mass immigration as an economic asset do not include many costs resulting from exponential population growth/high levels of immigration , among them , deterioration of quality of life , environmental degradation , traffic control , pollution control , social tension , etc . <p> Many immigrants are assets , but current historically high levels of immigration , about 1 million legal immigrants a year and an estimated 300,000 illegals , benefit employers like T.J. Rodgers at the expense of American and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coalition for <p> an Immigration Moratorium <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> WHITHER ENLIGHTENMENT ? <p> Editor  --  How many more stories are we going to have to hear about young girls having babies and abandoning them in public bathrooms or dumpsters or garbage cans before the public becomes more enlightened about sex education and abortion ? <p> ROBERT C. EDWARDS <p> Oakland <p> . <p> KOOKS AND BUFFS <p> Editor  --  Why do editors love to assert that Americans love conspiracy theories ? Do they think it is fun to believe that U.S. officials are lying about extra terrestrials ? Or presidential assassinations ? Is that why they call such critics " buffs " ? Why is it necessary to call people who think there may have been a wider conspiracy in Oklahoma City " kooks " ? Why is it necessary to assert that " endless speculation tears the country 's spirit " ? <p> Why has the Chron attacked the anemic rights of citizens to convene grand juries ? Secrecy and a lack of accountability are the enemies of humanity , not openness and investigation . <p> PETE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Editor  --  Your criticism of Governor Wilson 's welfare reform proposals is unfair and inaccurate . Governor Wilson had no choice but to stop Assembly Democrats from gutting the spirit and letter of the federal welfare reform in California . <p> You failed to note that the governor 's proposal prevents recipients from exhausting their five-year limit in another state then moving to California to start the clock ticking for another five years . I call that welfare fraud . <p> You also fail to note he has proposed an additional $ 277 million for child care services so mothers can gain the respectability and pride of work . He also proposed over $ 200 million in workfare programs . <p> Taxpayers have been subsidiz ing recipients for too long . The country demanded welfare reform so much so that Bill Clinton was forced to sign the historical bill that will begin to address the harm done by destroying the initiative to work . <p> Governor Wilson was a leader among U.S. governors in implementing the first experiments with workfare . Judging by this newspaper 's unrelenting criticism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserves . That is to be expected . But at least report on the governor 's proposals accurately . <p> ARTHUR BRUZZONE <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> MUSEUM 'S CONUNDRUM <p> Editor  --  It 's sad that the de Young Museum would trade its choice location to be squeezed into downtown , where it will be just another big building , all because they ca n't seem to beat the car conundrum . The museum claims it ca n't survive unless it accommodates everyone in his or her personal 3,000 pound steel encumbrance . But people with cars will leave them at home ( or at least at a distance ) if transit options are designed to suit the need , and are frequent and reliable . Have the best minds been brought together to come up with a public transportation solution to the dilemma ? <p> One thing for sure . The museum board should quickly dismiss a move to the site of the Transbay Terminal . In case the museum directors had n't noticed , there is a vital , functioning facility there right now , through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The irony of tearing down a public transit facility for the purpose of getting the museum closer to public transit is chilling . The museum should not play accomplice to Willie Brown in his ill- conceived scheme to demolish the terminal . <p> VICTORIA WAKE <p> Albany <p> . <p> AARON WILLIAMS CASE <p> Editor  --  Thursday 's Open Forum article from Van Jones proves the point that if you tell a lie often enough it becomes truth . Mark Andaya , no matter what else he may have done to enter the police department or while he was with it , did not kill Aaron Williams . Aaron Williams killed himself when he took a large dose of crack cocaine which induced excited delirium during or after his violent struggle to avoid being taken into custody by police . One of the best and most respected coroners in the country , Dr. Boyd Stevens , said that was so . Further , none of the officers present at that incident violated San Francisco Police Department policy in effect at that time . <p> Were it not for the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that resulted from this incident , an incident they forced to public notice in order to discredit or even destroy police authority in our country , Aaron Williams would have passed into history as he was , a criminal , involved in crime , who brought about his own demise . <p> Mr. Jones noted several " lessons " which should be learned by this incident . I agree , in part , with only one of them . The city must ensure that all police applicants are given a thorough background check and only those best qualified hired . As for calling for a ban on pepper spray , the only alternative , Mr. Jones , would be hitting people with a police baton , or shooting them , when they violently resist arrest . <p> LARRY P. BARSETTI <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> DEBATE ON DYING <p> Editor  --  Max Voigt 's comment in the Open Forum of July 10 seems to imply a disappointment with the recent Supreme Court decision on the " right to die . " What the court really said was that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wisdom in the reasons for this opinion . The court explained well the abuses that could ensue from legalizing physician assistance in dying . <p> On the other hand , there is no legal mandate for taking extreme measures to sustain life . It is therefore important that people express their wishes about medical treatment in the event of an emergency while they are still of sound mind . We urge everyone to sign a durable power of attorney or a living will for health care and leave it where it is readily accessible . <p> CAROL BRAGA , M.D. <p> Hospice by the Bay <p> . <p> NEW DEAL PROJECT <p> Editor  --  For a study of the legacy of the New Deal in the San Francisco Bay Area , The Institute for Historical Study would like to hear from men and women who worked on New Deal projects ( WPA , CCC , etc. ) and can share reminiscences , photographs , or other documentation of their experiences . <p> We are especially interested in finding people who helped to create public buildings , city or regional parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute for Historical Study , P.O.
