While it was not an easy decision to arrive at , one of the Blacks on the jury that found former heavyweight boxing champ Mike Tyson guilty of raping a beauty pageant contestant gave Jet a behind-the-scenes view of how they reached the verdict . Kenneth T. , one of two Blacks on the 12-person jury , said despite some grumblings by Tyson supporters who said the fighter got a raw deal , " this time and in this situation , the justice system worked . " The jury found Tyson guilty of raping Miss Black America contestant Desiree Washington , an 18-year-old from Providence , R.I. , at the Canterbury Hotel in Indianapolis last July 19 . Convicted on one count of rape and two counts of deviate sexual conduct , the 25-year-old boxer faces a maximum prison term of 20 years on each count , which would be served concurrently , when he is sentenced . " How could you all do that to that man ? " a Tyson backer asked Kenneth the day after the guilty verdict . His reply was simple : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be there . " After hearing almost 50 witnesses during ten days of testimony at the Marion County Courthouse , the jury , escorted by sheriff 's deputies , were taken to a room there to begin deliberations . They had been sequestered for almost two weeks during the trial , which garnered widespread media attention for Tyson , his accuser and the jury . The jurors had to be relocated from the Indianapolis Athletic Club , a downtown hotel and health spa to the Hilton Hotel , following an early morning three-alarm blaze midway through the trial . Two firefighters and a Chicago businessman were killed in the fire . All of the jurors were safely evacuated . Before the proceedings resumed , each juror was questioned to determine if they were too upset by the fire to continue on the panel . The request by a third Black juror to be excused after the fire was granted . Jurors were spared any details regarding the fire until after they had reached a verdict , Kenneth said . Once the closing arguments were presented on both sides , jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The way we started our deliberations , we came in and we did n't discuss anything ( about the case ) . During a sequestered trial , you 're all together ... but you can never talk about what you feel about the case , " Kenneth began , giving a glimpse behind the proceedings that led to Tyson 's conviction . He said all the jurors had questions in their minds that the prosecution and defense had left unanswered . As part of their civic duty , Kenneth said the group had the responsibility of separating speculation from fact to reach a verdict . But first off , they took a preliminary count to see where each juror stood in the case , he explained . " Before we opened up any type of arguments , we just took a preliminary count . The count was private and it came up 6 to 6 , " Kenneth said . The 24-year-old said " Then we started talking and deliberating . We were all taking notes . And about four hours into the deliberation , we took another count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate pizza and drank soft drinks as they pored over the evidence presented in the case . " The people who were not in agreement were pretty well known by this time , " said Kenneth , who is married and the father of two . He added , " Then the arguments got to be kind of heated . " After another four hours or so , another vote was taken with the remaining three holdouts siding with the majority for a 12-0 decision , he said . " It was a difficult thing to do . But at the end , we were all in agreement that we had made the best decision based on the evidence that we had , " Kenneth noted . A behavioral specialist in the local public school system , Kenneth said reaching a decision was one of the biggest challenges he 's ever faced . " They told us rape cases are always the hardest . In any other type of case you have solid physical evidence . In a murder case you have a weapon , fingerprints , but a rape case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really tough , because it all went basically on the credibility of the witnesses . " There was tons of evidence that both sides had , but most of it was inconsequential . Plus , there were a lot of inconsistencies in the testimony of Tyson and witnesses for him , " Kenneth said , explaining the jury 's decision in the case . He said the jury in the Tyson case made its ruling without regard to race or social status . " I 've heard people commenting that we were trying to make an example of him because he 's a celebrity , but that was n't it , " Kenneth assured . " If it had been me on trial , no special consideration would have been taken . We had to take out the fact of his celebrity status and look at it as an everyday trial . " he added . Furthermore , Tyson 's case was heard " by a jury of his peers " and racism played no part in the decision , Kenneth said . " I feel we ( Blacks ) were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as the jury was concerned . " While he admits " there are still a few flaws in the justice system-and that 's something that will just have to be dealt with in the long run-this time justice was served .
