Descending north off Chairback Mountain along the Appalachian Trail in Maine , I rounded a turn and stopped . A few steps ahead , the trail plummeted down a steep talus slope-just the sort of place where unstable footing and the bear-size load on my back could add up to a potent recipe for disaster . But the sun was setting and there was no time to stand around brooding , so I lengthened my trekking pole and adjusted my backpack suspension to " downhill . " A suspension system you can quickly adjust to handle the trail 's ups and downs is just one of the attention-grabbing features on Arc'Teryx 's new Bora 95 , a big pack designed for multiday backpacking and mountaineering trips . There 's also a deep , vertical back pocket so voluminous it stowed my foul-weather clothing , gorp bag , and extra water bottle with room to spare . Arc'Teryx started out making packs and harnesses for rock climbers , and true to the company 's roots , the Bora 95 bears a body-hugging suspension system . Dual stays aligned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A pair of long straps runs from the hipbelt , behind the back padding , to just above the shoulder . Tightening these straps shifts weight deliberately onto your hips , which is the preferred mode for lugging heavier loads or humping uphill . Loosening the straps allows the hipbelt to pivot , which is ideal with lighter loads ( when you do n't want all that rigidity ) and on descents ( when your hips work harder and rock more ) . The Bora 95 rode like many of the other high-end packs I 've worn , until I adjusted those straps in midstride . The way the weight shifts from uphill , or flat , mode to downhill is subtle , but the longer I wore the pack , the more I appreciated the change in gears . The hipbelt , which is made of four layers of foam curved to mimic the shape of your hips , requires several hours to break in , according to the owner 's manual . My first day I carried a heavy load of about 60 pounds , and my hips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its word , the hipbelt softened up and fit comfortably the next day . On several summer trips I found the carrying capacity of the Bora 95 to be more than I needed . It easily swallowed up to six days ' worth of food , a two-person tent including poles , and all my other gear . The sleeping bag compartment has an adjustable rollaway divider that partitions interior space . The large pocket clips to the top of the pack 's main body and lets you snug the contents down vertically , while side compression straps mounted directly to the pack 's frame cinch the load horizontally . All told , the compression system made even a bouncy load obedient . This pack pleases with little details , too . A flexible plastic plate behind your head can be popped outward to create a wide mouth for top-loading , and popped inward for maximum headroom . Hook-and-loop material lets you adjust the angle at which the hipbelt webbing exits the belt , a concession to all those differently shaped hips out there . All zippers are fitted with easy-to-grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to the pack 's capacious interior . The top pocket can be removed and used as a fanny pack . And there are two straps outside the bag compartment for securing your sleeping pad . The pack 's construction is ironclad . All seams are bound ( doubled over for reinforcement ) and stress points are either backstitched or bartacked . The main body is made of 420-denier nylon , with 1,000-denier Cordura in high-abuse areas . My one complaint is fairly minor . The exterior side pockets are a bit too shallow for water bottles . Although Arc'Teryx designed these long , thin pockets for accessories like climbing wands and tent poles , backpackers need a convenient stash for their bottles . Arc'Teryx does sell an optional hydration system ( bladder and feeder tube , about $24 ) that fits in the map pocket . The Bora 95 could be a little too high-tech for some folks . I invested more time educating myself about this packs operation than I probably have with any other model . Arc'Teryx has recognized this and plans to include detailed instructions with new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricacies . Photograph <p>
