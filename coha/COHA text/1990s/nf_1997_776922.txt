Introduction // Most historians of my generation , born on the eve of the Nazi era , recognize either explicitly or implicitly that plowing through the events of those years entails not only excavating and interpreting a collective past like any other , but also recovering and confronting decisive elements of our own lives . This recognition does not generate any agreement among us about how to define the Nazi regime , how to interpret its internal dynamics , how to render adequately both its utter criminality and its utter ordinariness , or , for that matter , where and how to place it within a wider historical context.Yet , despite our controversies , many of us share , I think , a sense of personal involvement in the depiction of this past , which gives a particular urgency to our inquiries . // For the next generation of historians  --  and by now also for the one after that  --  as for most of humanity , Hitler 's Reich , World War II , and the fate of the Jews of Europe do not represent any shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these events in present-day historical consciousness seems much greater than it was some decades ago . The ongoing debates tend to unfold with unremitting bitterness as facts are questioned and evidence denied , as interpretations and commemorative endeavors confront one another , and as statements about historical responsibility periodically come to the fore in the public arena . It could be that in our century of genocide and mass criminality , apart from its specific historical context , the extermination of the Jews of Europe is perceived by many as the ultimate standard of evil , against which all degrees of evil may be measured . In these debates , the historian 's role is central . For my generation , to partake at one and the same time in the memory and the present perceptions of this past may create an unsettling dissonance ; it may , however , also nurture insights that would otherwise be inaccessible . // Establishing a historical acccount of the Holocaust in which the policies of the perpetrators , the attitudes of surrounding society , and the world of the victims could be addressed within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best-known historical renditions of these events have focused mainly on the Nazi machinery of persecution and death , paying but scant attention to the wider society , to the wider European and world scene or to the changing fate of the victims themselves ; others , less frequently , have concentrated more distinctly on the history of the victims and offered only a limited analysis of Nazi policies and the surrounding scene.The present study will attempt to convey an account in which Nazi policies are indeed the central element , but in which the surrounding world and the victims ' attitudes , reactions , and fate are no less an integral part of this unfolding history . // In many works the implicit assumptions regarding the victims ' generalized hopelessness and passivity , or their inability to change the course of events leading to their extermination , have turned them into a static and abstract element of the historical background . It is too often forgotten that Nazi attitudes and policies can not be fully assessed without knowledge of the lives and indeed of the feelings of the Jewish men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at each stage in the description of the evolving Nazi policies and the attitudes of German and European societies as they impinge on the evolution of those policies , the fate , the attitudes , and sometimes the initiatives of the victims are given major importance . Indeed , their voices are essential if we are to attain an understanding of this past.For it is their voices that reveal what was known and what could be known ; theirs were the only voices that conveyed both the clarity of insight and the total blindness of human beings confronted with an entirely new and utterly horrifying reality . The constant presence of the victims in this book , while historically essential in itself , is also meant to put the Nazis ' actions into full perspective . // It is easy enough to recognize the factors that shaped the overall historical context in which the Nazi mass murder took place . They determined the methods and scope of the " Final Solution " ; they also contributed to the general climate of the times , which facilitated the way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with fervent nationalism and rabid anti-Marxism ( later anti-Bolshevism ) as its main propelling drives  --  that surfaced during the last decades of the nineteenth century and reached its climax after World War I ( and the Russian Revolution ) ; the new dimension of massive industrial killing introduced by that war ; the growing technological and bureaucratic control exerted by modern societies ; and the other major features of modernity itself , which were a dominant aspect of Nazism.Yet , asessential as these conditions were in preparing the ground for the Holocaust  --  and as such they are an integral part of this history  --  they nonetheless do not alone constitute the necessary cluster of elements that shaped the course of events leading from persecution to extermination . // With regard to that process , I have emphasized Hitler 's personal role and the function of his ideology in the genesis and implementation of the Nazi regime 's anti-Jewish measures . In no way , however , should this be seen as a return to earlier reductive interpretations , with their sole emphasis on the role ( and responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary interpretations have , it seems to me , gone too far . Nazism was not essentially driven by the chaotic clash of competing bureaucratic and party fiefdoms , nor was the planning of its anti-Jewish policies mainly left to the cost-benefit calculations of technocrats.In all its major decisions the regime depended on Hitler . Especially with regard to the Jews , Hitler was driven by ideological obsessions that were anything but the calculated devices of a demagogue ; that is , he carried a very specific brand of racial anti-Semitism to its most extreme and radical limits . I call that distinctive aspect of his worldview " redemptive anti-Semitism " ; it is different , albeit derived , from other strands of anti-Jewish hatred that were common throughout Christian Europe , and different also from the ordinary brands of German and European racial anti-Semitism . It was this redemptive dimension , this synthesis of a murderous rage and an " idealistic " goal , shared by the Nazi leader and the hard core of the party , that led to Hitler 's ultimate decision to exterminate the Jews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , and the interpretation presented here traces the interaction between the F*hrer and the system within which he acted . The Nazi leader did not take his decisions independently of the party and state organizations . His initiatives , mainly during the early phase of the regime , were molded not only by his worldview but also by the impact of internal pressures , the weight of bureaucratic constraints , at times the influence of German opinion at large and even the reactions of foreign governments and foreign opinion . // To what extent did the party and the populace partake in Hitler 's ideological obsession ? " Redemptive " anti-Semitism was common fare among the party elite . Recent studies have also shown that such extreme anti-Semitism was not unusual in the agencies that were to become central to the implementation of the anti-Jewish policies , such as Reinhard Heydrich 's Security Service of the SS ( Sicherheitsdienst , or SD ) . As for theso-called party radicals , they were often motivated by the kind of social and economic resentment that found its expression in extreme anti-Jewish initiatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we shall see , sometimes outside it , there were centers of uncompromising anti-Semitism powerful enough to transmit and propagate the impact of Hitler 's own drive . Yet , among the traditional elites and within the wider reaches of the population , anti-Jewish attitudes were more in the realm of tacit acquiescence or varying degrees of compliance . // Despite most of the German population 's full awareness , well before the war , of the increasingly harsh measures being taken against the Jews , there were but minor areas of dissent ( and these were almost entirely for economic and specifically religious-ideological reasons ) . It seems , however , that the majority of Germans , although undoubtedly influenced by various forms of traditional anti-Semitism and easily accepting the segregation of the Jews , shied away from widespread violence against them , urging neither their expulsion from the Reich nor their physical annihilation . After the attack on the Soviet Union , when total extermination had been decided upon , the hundreds of thousands of " ordinary Germans " ( as distinct from the highly motivated SS units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted no differently from the equally numerous and " ordinary " Austrians , Rumanians , Ukrainians , Balts , and other Europeans who became the most willing operatives of the murder machinery functioning in their midst . Nonetheless , whether they were conscious of it or not , the German and Austrian killers had been indoctrinated by the regime 's relentless anti-Jewish propaganda , which penetrated every crevice of society and whose slogans they at least partially internalized , mainly in the context of the war in the East .
