" . . . the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans , born in this century , tempered by war , disciplined by a hard and bitter peace . . . "  --  John F. Kennedy , Inaugural Address , 1961 <P> These stirring words commemorated the last time that one generation ceded power to the next . The 22-year age chasm between President-elect Bill Clinton and George Bush is the second largest in U.S. electoral history , surpassed only by the 27 years separating Kennedy and Dwight Eisenhower . But this generational conceit is unlikely to be updated as a theme for Clinton 's Inaugural Address . Imagine a hapless Clinton speechwriter struggling to reduce the baby-boomer life experience to tough-minded Kennedyesque cadences . No way would the incoming President dare tell the unvarnished generational truth : " Again , the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans , born after World War II , nurtured in prosperity , aroused by Vietnam , sustained by rock ' n ' roll , tested by drugs and promiscuity , embraced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living standards . " <P> At 46 , Clinton will be the third youngest President in history , out-youthed only by Kennedy and Theodore Roosevelt . For 40 years , World War II was a dominant life experience for eight Presidents in a row . All of them served in uniform  --  even Ronald Reagan , who sometimes also projected the fantasy that he had seen the horrors of combat . Clinton was not born until a year after Japan surrendered . " World War II is as far away from Bill Clinton 's generation as World War I was for George Bush 's generation , " observes Andrew Cherlin , a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University . " What is happening is that the first half of this century is receding in our institutional memory . " <P> As the nation 's first baby-boomer President , Clinton will bring to the Oval Office a fresh mental map of generational impressions . Gone are the Andrews Sisters , Kilroy and the Berlin blockade . In their place come Father Knows Best , Elvis , 1960s folk music ( Chelsea Clinton was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam protests , the 1972 George McGovern crusade and Watergate . Despite the politically exaggerated privation of his childhood , Clinton came of age at a moment of exceptional national privilege , when a studious young leader from Hot Springs , Arkansas , could aspire to an elite educational odyssey that carried him from Georgetown to Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship to Yale Law School . America of the 1960s worked for Clinton in ways that many children of today 's hard-pressed middle class can scarcely imagine .
