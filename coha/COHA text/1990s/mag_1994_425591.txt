Section : School Wars American Education Under Siege <p> RACHEL , a mentally retarded , speech-impaired 9-year-old with an IQ of 44 and a mental age of 4 , sits in a California classroom , obliviously staring at a textbook that is upside-down in front of her . Across the country in New Jersey , Rafael , a mentally retarded 5-year-old with an IQ of 59 and a mental age of 2 who can not speak intelligibly and who must be taken to the bathroom every 15 minutes , creates havoc with frequent outbursts , tantrums , and assaults on teachers , aides , and other students . <p> These scenes are the result of a movement called full inclusion , ' whose supporters declare that putting children like Rachel and Rafael into separate classes is a form of illegal discrimination . Proponents argue that full inclusion is required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) , which says disabled children should be educated with nondisabled children to the maximum extent appropriate . ' Yet IDEA also requires that public schools provide highly specialized education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is precisely what full inclusion fails to do . <p> Backed by ideologues in the U.S. Department of Education 's Office of Civil Rights , full inclusion is the latest egalitarian fad to be imposed upon the nation 's schools . The purpose is to eliminate the separate education of nearly all handicapped children and force them into regular classrooms , ignoring the objections of their parents and the recommendations of professional educators . In short , it represents a triumph of liberal ideology over education under the guise of civil rights . <p> In its most mindless form , full inclusion puts mentally retarded , speech-impaired , non-toilet-trained , extremely disruptive children with disparate needs in regular public-school classes . These children are supposed to pursue individualized curricula with aides , under the aegis of the teacher who is attempting to teach the whole class . To accomplish this formidable task , the teacher would be expected to bone up on special education and rely on an array of consultants . <p> In practice , the handicapped children would be denied the small-group , multi-sensory , carefully sequenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided by skilled certified teachers . The non-handicapped children would be denied their regular instruction and , to a greater or lesser extent , see their classes converted into special-education classes . This is an educational nightmare in which all the children emerge as losers . <p> It gets complex when you have kids with a broad range of abilities , ' Mary Crampton , a teacher in Eden Prairie , Minnesota , recently told the Wall Street Journal . Miss Crampton had taught a seventh-grade social-studies class that included eight low-IQ children and a deaf child with cerebral palsy as well as several gifted students . She described the class as a three-ring circus . ' <p> The American Federation of Teachers was so alarmed at the concept of full inclusion that it called for a moratorium on the practice in a December 1993 statement . It 's not just teachers who are paying the price , ' the AFT warned . Inappropriate inclusion lowers expectations that any student in that classroom can get the education they deserve , and the student who needs the most help invariably suffers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no resemblance to what most well-wishing people think of as mainstreaming children with disabilities into regular classrooms . It places children who can not function into an environment which does n't help them and often detracts from the education process for all students . ' <p> The policy presumes that handicapped children benefit by being placed with non-handicapped children . There is no scientific basis for this belief . Indeed , experience shows that such children are more isolated in the regular class , which imposes greater psychological pressure on them , resulting in behavior problems . Advocates of full inclusion respond to requests for substantiation of their claims by accusing critics of lacking sympathy for handicapped children . <p> Despite the dearth of evidence that full inclusion works , the policy has been endorsed by two federal appeals courts . In the 1993 case Oberti v. Clementon Board of Education , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the school district had violated IDEA by placing Rafael Oberti in a separate special-education class . The court decided that Rafael could be satisfactorily educated in a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior , and his need for frequent trips to the bathroom . In the 1994 case Holland v. Unified School District of Sacramento , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Rachel Holland , staring at her upside-down textbook , was a fully participating member of the class . <p> Cases of this sort were anticipated by the U.S. Supreme Court as early as 1982 . In Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley , Chief Justice William Rehnquist specifically warned against judicial interference with the formulation of educational methodology under IDEA : Courts must be careful to avoid imposing their view of preferable educational methods upon the States . The primary responsibility for formulating the education to be accorded to a handicapped child , and for choosing the educational method most suitable to the child 's needs , was left by the Act to State and local educational agencies . ' <p> The good news is that the cases decided in favor of full inclusion are law in only 2 of the nation 's 11 federal circuits , and there is contrary case law in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that controls public schools in this country , striving to comply with guidelines from the Education Department 's Office of Civil Rights and avoid lawsuits , sees these cases as the wave of the future . Whittier High School in Whittier , California , recently adopted a plan to integrate all children into regular classes , regardless of disability . Fred Zimmerman , Whittier 's principal , told the Wall Street Journal , With recent court cases , this will be the direction of all schools . ' <p> Suppose you are the parent of a non-handicapped child forced to attend quasi-special-education classes . Or suppose you are the parent of a handicapped child and want the special education to which your child is entitled by law . What recourse do you have ? Congress ca n't help you , because there is nothing wrong with the law ; it has simply been misinterpreted . Federal judges are not subject to the electoral process . The Supreme Court ca n't review Oberti because the school district did not appeal ; it may review Holland , but that case does not present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the immunity of an entrenched federal bureaucracy . <p> It may take parents some time to learn what is happening to their public schools and that they are powerless to do anything about it . Once they wake up , they may choose to wait through a few years of chaos until the same federal courts tell them that the decision in Oberti was a mistake , that parallel instruction and full inclusion really are not mandated . <p> On the other hand , with the havoc of full inclusion added to gross inefficiency , court-ordered secularization , and the conversion of schools into laboratories for social experimentation , these parents may finally give up on public education and join the growing number of Americans who support school vouchers . <p> As the exodus from public schools continues , the public-school system could be downsized to accommodate the children of the liberals who support full inclusion  --  unless , of course , they are already sending their kids to private schools . <p> By THOMAS J.
