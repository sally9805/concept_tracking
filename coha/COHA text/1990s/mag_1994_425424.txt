At first ridiculed for his hunch that a bacteria ( and not Marshall has since been proven right . <p> Stop worrying or you 'll get ulcers , people used to say . This was once considered sage advice , even by doctors , but it is now clear that worrying is n't the cause of this painful and sometimes fatal ailment . Rather , in most cases , ulcers are caused by a simple bacterium that can be readily killed with antibiotics and Pepto-Bismol . Instead of suffering with long-term and thus expensive ulcer drugs that are only palliative , patients are now cured with the new treatment . <p> The ulcer breakthrough came from an unexpected source . Barry Marshall , a brash young Australian doctor from Perth , was first ridiculed and now is lauded for pointing out that the Helicobacter pylori bacterium causes gastric ulcers . <p> For decades , doctors believed bacteria could not survive in the hostile hydrochloric acid environment of the stomach . The subject was considered closed until Barry Marshall , unable to get attention from the medical community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria to prove his point . He got sick , as he predicted he would . <p> Today , Dr. Marshall is trying to spread the word that more costly treatments such as Zantac and Tagamet are only maintaining , not curing , ulcer patients . Zantac , the most commonly prescribed medication for ulcers , costs from $64.99 to $98.51 monthly , when taken twice a day . Tagamet , less often ordered by physicians , costs $66.49 to $84.06 a month . <p> Drugs are not the only expense in traditional ulcer treatment . Innumerable work hours are lost when doctors tell patients that stress causes their ulcers . Employers , as well as employees , suffer when doctors advise ulcer patients to shorten their work week , change jobs , or even retire . <p> " Stress is what gets blamed when we do n't have the answer , " Dr. Marshall told us . " People with ulcers need not have their intelligence insulted because of the problem . It is such a relief now to simply take some antibiotics . <p> " I think regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. pylori is present , then they should be treated with antibiotics . Just having the bacteria and gastritis is enough to cause ulcer like symptoms . Therefore , I do n't advocate that people with H. pylori always have x-rays or endoscopies . " <p> While researching the Marshall story , I came across an ulcer Victim in our editorial offices . Ed Cortese , about to celebrate his 30th anniversary as an director of Jack and Jill magazine , had acquired an ulcer  --  a status symbol among art directors and managing editors . With a great deal of reluctance , he announced that he would be leaving our offices in Indianapolis soon . Although leaving his " baby " would be devastating ( both Ed and Jack and Jill had accompanied ' the move of The Curtis Publishing Company from Philadelphia to Indianapolis ) , Ed 's family in New Jersey , which included his physician son " Buzz " in Newark , wanted him home . <p> Before Barry Marshall 's coup de main , most doctors would have agreed that Ed 's work and worry had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worried , " he confessed to me . " Tossed about on the horns of this dilemma . " <p> " But Ed , " I assured him . " It is n't the stress . You can keep your stress and cure your ulcer at the same time . " <p> He was given a prescription for 250 mg metronidazole ( Flagyl ) four times a day and 500 mg tetracycline four times a day for two weeks . He was also to take two Pepto-Bismol tablets four times a day for four weeks . Local doctors are reporting up to a 90 percent cure rate with this triple therapy . With prescription and instructions in hand and a smile on his face , Ed walked off delighted to know that his ulcer might be cured and he could go right on worrying until he finally decided to go or stay in Indy . This talented illustrator at age 72 is the executive to whom all of the Children 's Better Health Institute 's artists report . Under his direction , six other children 's health publications have joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his longstanding job and his family 's desire to have him home . We assured Ed he could stay on staff and freelance from New Jersey . A FAX machine in his new home would solve his worry problem ; antibiotics will no doubt cure his ulcer . <p> Ed 's case was not the only one I encountered recently . The previous night , a favorite nephew confided at a birthday party that he was on Zantac for treatment of a long-term ulcer problem , but that there had been no noticeable improvement of his symptoms . As I explained Barry Marshall 's regimen to him , I thought how seldom I could feel so sure about recommending a new treatment for a longstanding problem . <p> Though Barry Marshall spoke of getting the word out worldwide , I feel there is much work to be done here at home . We talked with pharmacists from around the country to determine the prices of various ulcer treatment regimens and to find out how often they are being prescribed by physicians . We were told that Zantac is still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a super-strength Tagamet ) is also often prescribed in conjunction with amoxicillin . Tagamet is being less often prescribed . We asked other pharmacies around the country how frequently patients are being given antibiotics and Pepto-Bismol instead of Zantac . Zantac won . Many pharmacies reported that they are still filling prescriptions for Zantac without any mention of antibiotics . Health cost containment advocates will win when ulcers are cured in months instead of maintained for years . <p> We asked the pharmacists for their prices on the ulcer treatments and have published the wide range of costs in the survey above . Generally speaking , the costs were highest on the East and West coasts . <p> Next , we called Dr. Glenn Lehman , chairman of the gastroenterology department at the Indiana University School of Medicine . I felt certain he would be teaching his residents the Barry Marshall regimen . Sure enough , he was even fine-tuning the antibiotics and bismuth treatment . <p> " How much Pepto-Bismol do you prescribe ? " I asked . <p> " Thirty cc 's four times a day for a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Two hundred fifty milligrams every six hours for two weeks . " <p> " Tetracycline ? " <p> " Five hundred milligrams every six hours for two weeks . " <p> Dr. Lehman confirmed that with antibiotics and bismuth , patients no longer need to take lifelong Tagamet for their ulcers or gastritis . He reports that with the new treatment , they have an 85 percent cure rate at the Indiana University Medical Center . <p> " Ideally , you would identify the organism first , " he told us , " but it is n't always necessary to do the blood test for Helicobacter pylori before treating patients with documented ulcers , who do n't have another reason for having an ulcer . " <p> Dr. Joseph Katz , a gastroenterologist at Community Hospital in Indianapolis , was equally enthusiastic about the Marshall treatment of ulcers . " I have to keep them on Pepto-Bismol for a month after a two-week course of antibiotics . If I do n't , my patients ' ulcers recur , " he told us . <p> Barry Marshall told us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $50 . " There are more expensive and convenient treatments to take , but none of these really work much better than antibiotics with Pepto-Bismol , " he said . <p> He explained that bismuth ( the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol ) inhibits much bacteria in the gut . When it reaches the stomach acid , it precipitates into an insoluble compound , which is why its absorption is very low . Although only locally active in the stomach , it is present in the stool , and a high concentration of bismuth inhibits all those bacteria . <p> Dr. SerVaas : Have you ever tried bismuth subgallate instead of Pepto-Bismol ? <p> Dr. Marshall : Not in the U.S. I know bismuth subgallate is one of the other formulations of bismuth that is available . I 've used it in a couple of patients , but I have n't done studies with it . In Europe , they 've used other bismuth salts : subcarbonate and sub-gallate , which have been around for about 200 years for the treatment of indigestion and gastric problems . But no one really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were just antacids . Probably , they are all good treatments for gastritis . <p> Dr. SerVaas : The reason I was asking you about bismuth is that , coincidentally , we have had some salesmen who suffered from flatus , and they used a product called ColoFresh , which contains bismuth subgallate , to reduce the odor . They used it before dining with customers , and it worked . They also claimed it did wonders for halitosis . <p> Dr. Marshall : These are products that are used for colostomy patients ? <p> Dr. SerVaas : Yes , exactly . <p> Dr. Marshall : Bismuth kills all of those anaerobic bacteria that produce those smelly gases . <p> Unfortunately , we failed to ask Dr Marshall if gastric ulcers cause bad breath and if antibiotics and bismuth treatments eliminate halitosis . <p> Dr. SerVaas : It seems to me , with your fertile brain , that you should be working with the gastroenterologists to find the causes of ulcerative colitis and Crohn 's as well . <p> Dr. Marshall : I think , with molecular biology techniques , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these things in the next ten years . <p> Irritable bowel syndrome , also often blamed on stress , may be the next to go , Dr. Marshall said , with an enthusiasm that makes us believe the brash young doctor may be on the trail of another bug . <p> Dr. Marshall recently left full-time clinical duties at the University of Virginia to devote more time to projects relating to Helicobacter pylori . The Helicobacter Project is still underway at the University of Virginia . <p> When not at home in Charlottesville , Virginia , Dr. Marshall spends a great deal of time lecturing around the country and the world , trying to get the message about Helicobacter pylori out to patients and doctors alike . Serving as a consultant to a pharmaceutical company , Dr. Marshall is also working on a noninvasive diagnostic breath test that can detect the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the stomach . <p> The test will use carbon-13 or carbon-14 that , when ingested , reacts with the stomach enzyme urease . The simple breath test can accurately detect the presence of Helicobacter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uncomfortable endoscopy . <p> " Typically , a patient with stomach complaints could have a blood test or breath test to detect Helicobacter infection , " Dr. Marshall said . " Then , after a two week treatment , a second breath test would be done to confirm that the infection was cured . " <p> Patients interested in learning more about Helicobacter pylori can contact the Helicobacter Foundation . The phone number is 804-977-1594 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Unable to test his theory with laboratory animals , Dr. Barry Marshall became his own guinea pig and swallowed a nasty concoction that contained nearly a billion Helicobacter pylori bacteria . His stomach lining became inflamed , as he predicted it would . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Dr. Marshall 's hypothesis that antibiotics could cure H. pylori-induced ulcers have been confirmed by more than a dozen medical studies , most recently by a team of Austrian researchers reporting in The New England Journal of Medicine . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Today , Dr. Marshall is trying to tell the world that gastric ulcers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ulcer regimen . " Stress , " says Dr. Marshall , " is what gets blamed when we do n't have the answer . " He believes that a similar bug may cause some irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) problems , long considered to be stress-related . <p> SURVEY OF ULCER TREATMENT COSTS TABLE <p> By Cory SerVaas , M.D. <p> Illustrated by Don Trawin <p>
