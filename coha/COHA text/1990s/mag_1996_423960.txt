Two managers at a great high-tech company developed a new way to lead . They stood aside and let subordinates come up with the answers . // Second-rate systems can be found even at Hewlett-Packard one of the world 's best managed corporations and currently No. 9 on FORTUNE 'S list of Most Admired companies . HP 's North American distribution organization handles billions of dollars in products , from PCs to toner cartridges , from order to delivery . But there was a problem : On average , it took a languid 26 days for a product to reach the customer . Employees shuttled information through a tangle of 70 computer systems , some decades old-and this at a leader of the hightech industry . The job of reengineering the process fell to two seasoned managers , Mei-Lin Cheng , 44 , and Julie Anderson , 46 . They came up with an extraordinary strategy . Assigned to create entirely new processes , they bought freedom from their bosses at HP by agreeing to produce significant and measurable improvements in customer satisfaction-in less than nine months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team of 35 people from HP and two other companies , explained the ground rules-and then vigorously refused to tell anyone what to do . Result : They met the deadline and achieved their goal . FORTUNE : What was wrong with HP 's business as usual ? ANDERSON : We were just cranking the wheel , taking care of this problem , satisfying that customer , making the goals for this year and then next year doing the same thing all over again . Patching things together with bubble gum did n't feel good . This complaint is not about HP . The whole economy is changing , society is changing , and organizations are stuck in a certain way of managing . We have n't got a system that matches where we need to go . CHENG : We were both passionate about not doing things the same old way . I was striving for a much higher level of integration of my work and personal life . I 'd come home after giving someone a negative performance evaluation and escape into jogging , so I could just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how to structure this project , and pretty soon we said , " Maybe we should n't have a structure at all ? " When people are free to define their own goals and roles at work , their commitment intensifies , and the job becomes more personally meaningful . You do n't feel as if you 're leaving your real self in the parking lot before you come in to work . Your contribution can be richer . You 're energized at the end of the day , instead of feeling I 'm dead , give me a drink . FORTUNE : Do n't remind me . How do you create this miracle of integration ? ANDERSON : Let me explain the situation first . We were creating a complicated system , using millions of dollars of offthe-shelf software from an outside vendorSAP-to create a single , unified database covering everything from the customer order through credit check , manufacturing , shipping , and warehousing to invoicing . We had to reengineer all those systems , so it was incredibly complex . We wanted everybody-including team members from Andersen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the whole system . CHENG : Most of these complicated information-technology projects fail-the industry 's failure rate is as high as 70% . You 're taking too long , and you 're over budget . And by the time you get it done , the business need has changed . ANDERSON : We decided that if we could n't get results in one year , we were probably taking the wrong approach . That 's why , when we started last November , we agreed to put our heads in the noose by committing to real business results before the funding review scheduled for nine months later . We ended up meeting that target in eight months . Our pilot program focused on one customer , an office-products distributor that accounted for a large share of the multibillion-dollar sales of this part of HP . We 've consistently delivered products to them in eight days , vs. 26 days before . That enabled them to cut their inventories by nearly 20% while increasing service levels to their customers . And so we got our funding for the project 's second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the team so effective ? ANDERSON : We took things away : no supervisors , no hierarchy , no titles on our business cards , no job descriptions , no plans , no step-by-step milestones of progress . We located as much of the team as we could in one office , explained the time frame and the business measures , and left them to figure out what to do . The idea was to create a sense of personal ownership . FORTUNE : And the result was complete chaos ? CHENG : Naturally . ANDERSON : We started with a two-week training and orientation program , to familiarize everyone with the existing processes and the needs of the business . For instance , we all physically followed an order through every step . When the order was sent to HP headquarters for batch processing on an outdated computer system , everybody took a bus to headquarters and talked to the people there about their jobs . The tour took three days , but everyone got a tacit understanding of the process . Practically everywhere we went we saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were devoted to reconciling information from one computer system to another . We introduced a couple of key ideas , such as the value of considering diverse points of view , and MIT professor Peter Senge 's systems thinking , which emphasizes learning skills and teaches a perspective encompassing the whole of a situation , not just the parts . We simulated a kindergarten classroom with little chairs and crayons , to remind people of how they felt when learning was fun . CHENG : It set the tone : We 're all in this together , guys . We 're going to do something different . FORTUNE : Let 's hear about the chaos . ANDERSON : When people came back from the orientation , they were anxious to start . Everyone felt the time pressure . They asked us how to organize the work , and we just said , Start . They spent the whole first month in one long meeting , trying to figure out what to do . CHENG : Eventually they agreed that the first step should be conceptual design . So they tried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach was to have a group working on one module , let 's say finance , and other teams working on other modules . But then we realized that if we worked on each piece separately , the traditional way , we 'd run into the old problem of how to integrate them later . One person told me she spent the first two months feeling we were wasting her talents . Then she realized we were n't actually preventing her from contributing , so why not just do it ? FORTUNE : They must have had smoke coming out of their ears . ANDERSON : Oh , yes . Some people would come up to us and say , Why do n't you just tell us what to do so that we can move on ? This is a big waste of time . And we 'd say , If we give you an answer , it might not be the right one . This was their introduction to the idea that no one of us can see the whole system perfectly . The more people focusing on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I am smarter than you , you are wrong . This is your chance to try something different . FORTUNE : How much of that was sincere and how much was theater ? ANDERSON : Well , I really did n't know what the right answer was . I could have made some suggestions . I had some ideas that might have helped ... FORTUNE : Probably some very good ideas . ANDERSON : Yes . FORTUNE : And yet ? ANDERSON : I sat on my hands . Chewed on my fingernails . CHENG : I had some internal struggles about not speaking out . I sometimes woke up in the middle of the night , wondering what the next step should be . ANDERSON : I never slept better . I felt like a burden had been taken off my shoulders . I was out of the rat race . The difficulty was that we 'd all been rewarded for being able to stand up with a chart and point to results . We could n't do that anymore . As we struggled with our new roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team , to serve as role models of living with that vulnerability . FORTUNE : How often were you reporting in to your masters at HP ? ANDERSON : Not very often , if we could avoid it . It was very hard to honestly represent the situation in those early days in a way that would mean anything to people from outside the team . We would meet the project 's sponsors in the hallways , and they would ask how things were going . We would say , Well , fine , you know , we 're still working on it . FORTUNE : HOW did the team finally get out of the rut ? ANDERSON : We 'd made some progress , but within a couple of months we were in a tough spot . Some people suggested that , since we already had the SAP software , we could try to execute orders on it . We had some very lengthy discussions about that . Finally somebody said , This is like the movie Groundhog Day . Bill Murray plays a character who relives one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out how to get to the next day of his life , so he tries all sorts of things . He begins by learning simple things , like remembering not to step in a puddle on the street . Eventually he learns to stop living just in his mind , to listen to his heart and soul . Each time the day began again , his clock radio played Sonny &; Cher 's " I Got You Babe . " That story became the metaphor for our team . Every day at 8:30 A.M. we 'd play that song . And every day we tried to process an order through the system . FORTUNE : So the real secret here is dealing with bite-size problems one by one ? ANDERSON : In a way . The idea was to try things out and learn as we go along-to learn by practicing , like an orchestra or a sports team . People in business too rarely get a chance to practice . CHENG : At first we did n't have a complete system , so we represented the various pieces with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Boise , a Lego Polynesian boat stood in for a Japanese supplier , a can of beans was Finance . The first time we put an order into the system , we could n't even get it to the warehouse . I remember one discussion then about whether to stop the practice . A team member said , Why do we have to be perfect right away ? Imagine this as Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard starting the company . Do you think they waited until all their order-fulfillment processes were perfect before opening the door for business ? The team kept at it , identifying problems and improving the system bit by bit . The first time we successfully simulated getting an order all the way to the customer , the process took about ten days . Something would break down , and we would have to fix it . Finally we got to the point where we could do an order in a day . Then we started launching simultaneous orders , making it more and more complex . FORTUNE : What have you learned ? ANDERSON : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have introduced . Every morning there is a practice meeting where we discuss what happened yesterday , what did we learn , what are we struggling with , what are our priorities . CHENG : Another lesson : You do n't need to tackle complexity with complex solutions . Our approach is to jump in , bite off what we can chew , and learn as we go . You 've got to start without knowing where the journey is going to take you . ANDERSON : What we 're trying to do is to build the capacity to learn , first in individuals and ultimately in the organization . That 's the only way we know to get an organization that 's nimble in responding to business needs . We 're both still learning what our role as managers should be . One thing we know for sure , though , is that we do n't make the decisions . <p>
