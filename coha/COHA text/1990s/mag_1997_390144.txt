Every day , TV news exposes our children to murders , kidnappings , and bombings . How can we calm their fears and help them feel safe ? // Eight-year-old Caitlin Tanner* and her classmates ca n't stop talking about JonBenet Ramsey , the little blond beauty queen whose murder last December has been the subject of countless newscasts . At an age when their tastes run to baggy blue jeans and simple T-shirts , most of the girls ' commentary revolves around why they do n't like JonBenet 's fancy clothing , and how silly it is for little girls to wear makeup . Occasionally , they come seeking a parent 's reassurance : " Mommy , am I as pretty as JonBenet ? " But every week or two-after yet another story airs on the evening news-more disturbing questions arise : " Mommy , you would never let anyone kill me , right ? " ' There 's no shortage of news to terrify a child : Heaven . ' s Gate , Bosnia , Oklahoma City , O.J.

" Kids today live in a world where violence is the norm , " says Ellen Casper , Ph.D. , a clinical psychologist practicing in Ohio . " There are things to be afraid of that did n't confront us when we were children . When there are stories about a man taking a child out of her bedroom in a safe neighborhood , children have good reason to be afraid . " Most of the time , a child 's fears can be calmed with a simple reassurance , but in some situations that same child 's reaction may he more extreme-often because she 's imagining what it would be like if what happened on the news happened to her . " Kids tend to spend their thinking energies on the " what-ifs , ' ' " says Casper . " They wonder : " What if I was kidnapped ? What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen Morris , Ph.D. , a clinical psychologist in Utah who has experience in treating children traumatized by exposure to violence , recalls his own feelings of terror at news stories hc heard as a child in the 1950 's . " We were being sent home from school for these air-raid drills , " he says . " I had gotten it into my head that if the clouds were pink , it meant there was nuclear fallout , and I remember being so frightened that I would n't get home before I was hit . " While parents must first protect their children by limiting the amount of televised violence they 're allowed to watch ( see " Too Young for TV News ? " ) , it 's also important to make sure children are n't so sheltered that they 're unable to deal with the things they encounter when they 're away from parental controls . " Parents have to be prepared to deal with the fact that children are going to hear about these events one way or another , and they are going to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a professor of psychiatry at Havard Medical School and the director of the Media Center of Boston 's Judge Baker Children 's Center . From child psychologists and social workers , here 's how to help your child deal with frightening news stories : Photograph * 1ome names have been changed to protect privacy . // Encourage them to talk Often a parent 's first instinct when faced with a child 's irrational fear is a reflexive , " Oh , do n't be silly , honey . " " Parents think if we do n't talk about it , children will forget it , but it 's not so , " says Betsy McAlister Groves , director of the Child Witness to Violence Project at Boston Medical Center . Instead , says Groves , ask questions that will draw your child out , and help you understand exactly what 's bothering her . She suggests phrases such as : " Why are you asking me that ? What did you see ? What scared you ? Do you still think about it ? When ? What worries you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violent event , they 're going to want to know : " Could something like this happen to me ? ' ' " says Casper . " Do n't just wait for them to ask questions and assume if they do n't , then they 're not frightened . Be sure there 's no misunderstanding . " Jayne C. Shelton , a licensed clinical social worker in private practice in Utah , worked with a 7-year-old girl who began having crying fits and refusing to go to school after watching news reports on the Oklahoma City bombing . " Someone 's going to blow up my school , " she kept telling her parents as she clung to them when it was time to leave for school . A few weeks after her fear surfaced , the first grider 's parents contacted Shelton . " This was not a disturbed child , but she was having an extreme reaction , " says the social worker . When Shelton asked the girl to describe what would make school safe , the response was simple : " If Daddy was in school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father to tour the school with his daughter and the principal , and the father made reassuring comments to the girl as he inspected the locks on the doors , fire detectors , and emergency numbers near phones . On subsequent days , the girl 's older brother , also a student at the school , took time to visit her in class , and within a couple of weeks , the girl was going to school without worry . Answer simply Although it 's important to talk to a child about what they may be hearing on the news , too much talk can be even more upsetting . " It 's important to be careful with language , " says Groves . " Give children the information they 've asked for but not more than they 've asked for . " Lisa Verhovek , a mother in Houston , learned that lesson during O.J. Simpson 's criminal trial . Her son Gordie , then 8 , had seen televised reports on the verdict and asked his parents about the case . " We got into a discussion about jurors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they make mistakes . He then got it into his mind that juries are fallible , " says Verhovek . Like many children his age , Gordie , took the idea personally . " At bedtime he 'd say , " I ca n't sleep , I 'm worring that when I grow up I 'm going to be accused , and the jury is going to make a mistake , and I 'm going to have to go to jail , ' ' " she recalls . Her response was prompt , and completely reassuring . " I said , " This will never happen to you . This is a rare case . The system works . ' ' " Within a few days , Gordie was falling off to sleep without fear , although he continued to ask about the case for several weeks . Find the source Pinning down the exact cause of a child 's fear , as Verhovek did , also makes it easier to choose a course of action . Groves consulted on the case of an 8-year-old boy from suburban Boston who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the California case of Polly Klaas , in which the young girl was kidnapped from ber home and killed . It turned out that the boy 's bedroom was near a sunroom with big sliding glass doors ; his perception was that it would be easy for a kidnapper to come through those doors and take him away . Once they knew this , his parents moved him into another bedroom , and that was enough to calm him . " As long as he 's away from doors , he feels safe , " says Groves . Reassure , reassure , reassure While some children may require only a single reassuring response , others may need to be conforted over and over - a behavior that child threapists say is completely normal . " Sometimes we miscalulate how frightening these things are for children , " says Madeline Levine Ph.D. , a clinical psychologist practicing in Marin County , CA , and the author of Viewing Violence : How Media Violence Affects Your Child 's and Adoloscent 's Development .

For a child , asking questions is a way of relieving their anxieties , " says Dr. Poussaint . Along with reassurance and empathy - " I 'm upset , too , but this wo n't happen to you ; I 'm here to protect you " - it 's also important to adhere closely to the child 's regular routine . " Their sense of order in the world is shaken , " says Groves . Bedtime , school , soccer , and meals should continue to be predictabe parts of your child 's day . " Life goes on , " says Groves . " Do n't just say it , demonstrate it . " Appeal to logic Arm your child with concrete ways to deal with the things that upset them . This ammunition can come in many forms , explains Morris . " The idea is to take the fear and look at it in some sort of rational terms : " I can see this really scares you . Let 's talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't think it ever will , but here are things you can do .

Morris taught him the laws of probability , a concept he was old enough to understand .

" You can demonstrate that there 's some distance between where this frightening thing happened , and where you live , " says Shelton . " It 's very important to help children collect facts , " says Groves . " If they 're armed with facts , they can confront the things they imagine can hurt them . " * <p>                 @ @ @ @
