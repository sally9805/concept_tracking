WHEN LIFE EXPLODED <P> " This report should end discussions about whether God created the earth . Now there is no way to deny the theory of evolution . " MARTIN WOLF Karlsdorf , Germany <P> YOUR ARTICLE WAS A REFRESHING LOOK at the new discoveries related to evolution COVER STORY , Dec. 4 . Darwin 's theory is regarded by many as the best explanation of the evolution of life on this planet and is not questioned by most people . Biology classes teach Darwinian theory as one that is basically accepted by scientists . I was surprised and excited to see the idea of sudden bursts of evolution brought into public discussion . These are legitimate possibilities , presented by the explosion of biological diversity , that do not fit nicely into Darwin 's theory . I had studied them in my biology class but found it frustrating that many others were not familiar with them . This report was a bold move . KEVIN SMITH Aurora , Illinois <P> I AM NOT A ZEALOT ON ANY SIDE OF THE origin-of-species debate , but when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got excited . It implied that a group of scientists has somehow figured everything out and that the Big Bang is no longer a theory but fact . But actually this concept of evolving life should still only be referred to as a theory , because it can not be scientifically proved . DOUG WEST Lebanon , Oregon Via E-mail <P> IT REALLY TAKES A WRITER WITH IMAGInation to be able to describe the blow to the current theories of evolution as crossing " a critical threshold . " All the phyla of Earth " appear " so suddenly that this is called an " explosion . " Darwin himself would have been blown away . But Canadian paleontologist Guy Narbonne absorbs this gigantic problem by saying , " ... there also seems to be a non-Darwinian kind of evolution that functions over extremely short time periods  --  and that 's where all the action is . " TIME 's nonscientific speculation is the height of gullibility . You tell us that after the Cambrian explosion , everything else was a piece of cake . Even the human brain might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could some human brains be tinkering with details to try to prop up entrenched dogmas that are being severely undermined by marvelous discoveries like this one ? JULIA HENDRICKSON Calistoga , California <P> IF STEVEN JAY GOULD 'S BOOK WONDERful Life , which described the strangeness of early fossils , was fascinating , your update of new scientific findings is more so . It not only adds pieces to this intriguing puzzle but also goes one step further : making an analogy between the events of the Cambrian explosion and the characteristics of a chaotic system . In so doing , you raise a disturbing question : Might not theoretical biologist Stuart Kauffman 's idea of the intrinsic instability of the evolving system be greatest when the gradient of change is at its steepest ? If so , is the closing paragraph of your report pointing out the precariousness of human existence in the face of the current technological ' ' big bang ' ' ? CHARLES F. ( ' ' CHICK ' ' ) KELLER Los Alamos National Laboratory Los Alamos , New Mexico Via E-mail <P> A MORE APPROPRIATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Bust . " One hundred and thirty five years of Darwinism out the window just like that ? What a poor excuse for the absence of transitional forms . The Book of Genesis is looking better all the time .
