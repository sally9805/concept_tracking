<p> WHEN Stephen Sondheim took on the score for " A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum " in the late 1950 's , he was going on 30 and musically frustrated . Broadway knew him only as the lyricist for Leonard Bernstein 's " West Side Story " ( 1957 ) and Jule Styne 's " Gypsy " ( 1959 ) . <p> But since his teens , when he was tutored by Oscar Hammerstein 2d , Mr. Sondheim had considered himself as much a composer as a lyricist . A music major at Williams College , he had taken postgraduate composition lessons with the brainy Serialist Milton Babbitt . He knew a vast amount of music , had written several shows and dozens of songs , and was aching to produce a score for Broadway , both lyrics and music . <p> " Forum " ( 1962 ) finally gave him that chance . His songs spilled over with elegance and compositional skill , as if the author were showing off . Catching the current production at the St. James Theater , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pointed to later adventures  --  though not in the way it seems on the surface . <p> For all the talk of " Forum " harking back to the days of good clean farce , theatrically it is an experimental work . It completely subverts the heritage of what is called the book show , handed down by Rodgers and Hammerstein , where the songs emerge from the plot . In " Forum , " the songs purposely interrupt the farcical plot , giving the audience a needed break from the madcap hysterics . Mr. Sondheim 's lyrics are endlessly inventive ; his music is genial and felicitous . Yet this is the work of a composer still in search of a distinctive voice . <p> He found that voice , not , as so often argued , by pushing the boundaries of theater music but by looking backward to the music he revered . Conceptually , the Sondheim shows would grow increasingly outlandish : a ghoulish tale of an avenging London barber and his pie-baking paramour who slice ' n ' dice then bake ' n ' serve their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet no matter how theatrically daring , every Sondheim show seems to have a purely musical agenda as well : his music is very often about other genres of music . While the composer has acknowledged this in interviews , his use of the evocative technique is more central to his work than has been noted . His borrowings are pervasive and encompass music as far afield from Broadway as Schubert lieder and Japanese pentatonic folk songs . Of course , all creators evoke , imitate or just plain steal from works they admire . Think of Picasso , whose early paintings are both a homage and a challenge to Cezanne , a master he revered and grappled with . <p> In Mr. Sondheim 's case there are two factors that seem inseparable from his " play " with older genres : he is famously a creator of riddles and games ; and he is an extremely private person . In the first case , deconstructing another composer 's style and reinventing it in one 's own language can be compared to solving a puzzle . In the second , adapting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Sondheim allows an unusual degree of expressive freedom to infuse the music , revealing an affection for the older style that is infectious . <p> Some of his evocations are explicit  --  pastiche songs , he calls them . " Follies " ( 1971 ) , which recounts the memories and regrets of former follies showgirls meeting for a 30th reunion , is virtually a compendium of old-time song forms meticulously rendered . " One More Kiss " comes right out of Sigmund Romberg operettas . " Love Will See Us Through " could be a Jerome Kern tune with a wry Ira Gershwin lyric ( " But though I 'll do my utmost/ To see you never frown/ And though I 'll try to cut most/ Of our expenses down . . . " ) . " Losing My Mind " evokes George Gershwin with a melancholy lyric by Dorothy Fields ( " The sun comes up/ I think about you/ The coffee cup/ I think about you . . . " ) . <p> Sometimes Mr. Sondheim 's looking back can seem almost neoclassical , not unlike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music that commented upon older music he loved . Mr. Sondheim 's 1973 work , " A Little Night Music , " is a good example of this technique . To tell this cynical story of prosperous , inconstant Swedes at the turn of the century , he wrote a score that dances in three-quarter time , evoking 19th-century European parlor music , German lieder and Brahms waltzes . <p> IN BORROWING FROM OLDER sources , Mr. Sondheim honors them . Like Stravinsky , he recreates the classical genres in his own voice , modernizing the harmonic language . " The Miller 's Son " is a clear example , a song of bleak resignation sung by Petra , the household servant . In mood , meter and texture , " The Miller 's Son " echoes " The Miller and the Brook , " from Schubert 's great cycle , " Die Schone Mullerin " ( " The Lovely Miller 's Daughter " ) . Yet the astringent harmonies , the supple vocal line , the bitterly ironic lyrics and the restlessly syncopated middle section represent Mr. Sondheim in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does not matter : the resemblances are indisputable . <p> This preoccupation with musically commenting upon other music can be heard in every Sondheim show ; but the seeds of the technique were planted in " Forum " and cultivated in his subsequent shows , as a look at the early work reveals . <p> For example , in " Forum , " when Philia , a vacuous maiden who belongs to a trader in women , sings " Lovely " to Hero , the young Adonis next door , the song both spoofs and pays homage to the old-time romantic Broadway ballad , like something from Irving Berlin 's slightly sentimental vein . " I 'm lovely , " Philia sings rapturously ; " all I am is lovely , lovely is the one thing I can do . " Mr. Sondheim 's affection for the old-fashioned song form he so carefully evokes transforms the moment and the character . The empty-headed Philia seems tender and self-effacing . We laugh , but we like her . <p> In " Anyone Can Whistle , " completed two years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This black comedy of Cora Hoover Hoople , a crooked mayor who devises a phony miracle to rescue her town 's finances and assure her control , bogs down with heavy-handed explorations of insanity and was a commercial failure . The score though retains a cult following . <p> The wistful title song is a prime example of a Sondheim book song , as he has called them , a straightforward lyrical utterance that emerges convincingly from the book . But the score is dominated by pastiche songs . Mr. Sondheim uses the idiom of the brassy 1940 's star-turn musical to make Cora ( the role created by Angela Lansbury ) seem anachronistic and fake . Here , his attempt to use pastiche to comment on the characters seems forced . <p> His achievement in " Company " ( 1970 ) was to brilliantly integrate the evocative songs into a theatrical concept . To convey the dilemma of Bobby , a bachelor incapable of commitment and everybody 's best friend , Mr. Sondheim turned for musical sources to contemporary pop . The songs are strewn through with disco rhythms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sultry Latin pop ( " Barcelona " ) . <p> A new collaborator , Jonathan Tunick , who would become Mr. Sondheim 's most frequently used orchestrator , spiked the band with electric guitars and synthesizers . Yet the harmonies are Sondheimesque , rich with ninth chords and pungent dissonances , more sophisticated than anything found in 60 's rock and pop . <p> In later shows , Mr. Sondheim seems to have chosen subjects for the chances they gave him to evoke distant musical genres . " Pacific Overtures " drew loosely from Far Eastern musical traditions to tell the story of Commodore Perry 's expedition to Japan . The other obvious source is Gilbert and Sullivan , who also tried their hand at evoking Japanese exotica . <p> " Sunday in the Park With George " ( 1984 ) is the composer 's take on contemporary concert music idioms . His harmonies , drenched in the tonally unhinged plushness of Ravel and Debussy and the tart language of Britten , depict the painter Georges Seurat attempting to bring order to the chaos of his life . The elements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodies and motoric rhythms  --  perfectly capture the painter 's radical dot-dot-dot technique . <p> " Sweeney Todd " ( 1979 ) is a homage to Victorian melodrama with a manipulative modern musical device . It begins in utter grimness . But as Sweeney 's story unfolds and his mission of homicidal revenge becomes clear , the music gets lighter so as to cushion the gore . Except for those moments when the Greek chorus of downtrodden Londoners appear to warn us about him , the dramatic perspective is Sweeney 's . The music urges us to see the demon barber of Fleet Street as a man driven to crime by vicious injustice . We are meant to be swept away by the rhapsodic lyricism of " Pretty Women , " sung by Sweeney in a duet with the lecherous Judge Turpin . <p> IF " A LITTLE PRIEST , " THE ACT I finale for Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett , were a nihilistic song about cutting up powerful people ( or luckless nobodies ) and baking them into pies , the audience would get up and leave . Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repartee  --  bad puns and all . The music seductively invites you to find something daffy and endearing in Mrs. Lovett and her repellent idea . Only at the end , when Sweeney is finally stopped , do the choristers win the moral ( and musical ) debate that has been waged in the show . <p> After " Sweeney Todd , " the evocations are increasingly overshadowed by what Mr. Sondheim has called his modular technique , in which all the themes , inner voices and bass lines in a score derive from the same few musical ideas . This was not new to his work . In " Sweeney Todd , " for example , the four-note , dirgelike " Dies Irae " motif for the chorus gets inverted and turned into the first four notes of " These Are My Friends , " Sweeney 's haunting ode to his gleaming razors , his instruments of revenge . <p> The technique of thematic interrelatedness is strikingly employed in " Merrily We Roll Along " ( 1981 ) , Mr. Sondheim 's most crushing failure and my favorite Sondheim score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was writing what his detractors have always accused him of being unable to write : a tuneful , sassy , nostalgic Broadway show . He even makes fun of himself in one lyric , when a slick producer admonishes Franklin and Charley , the songwriting team we follow ( in reverse , since the show has a backward chronology ) from jaded middle age to youthful idealism . The producer thinks their new songs are too highbrow . " There 's not a tune you can hum , " he sings . " Why do n't you throw them a crumb . " <p> Compositionally , all the songs in " Merrily " derive from a few melodic motifs , providing a musical parallel to the interactions in the lives of the three central characters . Mr. Sondheim 's craft is hidden . His listeners are invited to just sit back and enjoy the tunes , among his most memorable ( " Good Thing Going " and " Not a Day Goes By " ) . <p> " Into the Woods " ( 1987 ) is another modular score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of fairy tale characters who get mixed up in one another 's fables . The 1994 " Passion , " however , Mr. Sondheim 's most recent musical , suggests that his use of evocation as a technique may be coming to an end . <p> In " Passion , " there are echoes of Impressionism , and the military compound where the story takes place is captured with drum riffs and brass fanfares . But Mr. Sondheim 's abiding concern is to weave the music intricately into this unsettling story of a homely , sickly , well-read woman with a manipulative love for a handsome young military officer . The meshing of score and story is so complete you can hardly tell when the music stops and speaking begins . Perhaps Mr. Sondheim succeeds too well at what he is attempting , for the music almost disappears into the drama . <p> But a recent revival near Washington was reportedly a revelation , which should come as no surprise . Mr. Sondheim 's scores , like those of other masters , take time , often years , to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sunday <p> CORRECTION : An article on page 5 of the Arts and Leisure section today about Stephen Sondheim refers incorrectly in some copies to the winner of the Tony Award this year for best revival of a musical .
