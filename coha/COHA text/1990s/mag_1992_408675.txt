Where have all the dealmakers gone ? From their low profile you might assume they had retired en masse to a Caribbean tax haven . Or perhaps joined the witness-protection program . Well , they are traveling under an alias . The new name for people who used to call themselves venture capitalists or leveraged-buyout specialists : private equity investors . Says Steven P. Galante , who publishes the monthly newsletter Private Equity Analyst : " Lets face it . Instead of calling yourself an LBO artist , you might as well just call yourself Satan . " Much more than the name of the game has changed . The conditions that made these investors so successful , at least for a glorious blip of time  --  Silicon Valley 's boom , Wall Street 's limitless leverage  --  do n't exist anymore . The word got out that despite some highly touted killings , venture capital partnerships started up after 1983 produced meager average annual returns of less than 4% . Even some of the LBO partnerships at Wall Street 's Noble House , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sources of capital began drying up . Banks and insurance companies , stuck with acres of bad real estate loans , did n't want any more illiquid , high-risk , low-return investments . From year-end 1989 through October 1991 , the assets of these private equity partnerships fell 34% , to $24.9 billion , according to a Private Equity Analyst survey . In particular , capital held by LBO firms dropped 32% , to $11.2 billion . Figuring that the feasible debt-equity ratio for deals has shrunk from 9 to 1 down to 3 to 1 , the actual purchasing power of LBO firms has fallen 73% in only two years . Despite this difficult environment for dealmakers , a select group of firms is surviving and even prospering in the hung-over Nineties . Here 's how : CAPTURING THE CASH FLOW C. Kevin Landry TA Associates * Approaching a quarter century in the business , Boston 's TA Associates is one of the most admired , longest-running , and largest of the venture capitalists . The firm has $700 million under its wing , and managing partner Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work by scouring the annual Inc. magazine listing of the 500 fastest-growing private companies . He figures that only 5% received financing from professional venture capital firms because these little speedsters are increasingly cropping up outside venture capital 's traditional domains of computer and medical technology . So Landry is no longer poking into garages and elbowing his competitors out of the way looking for the startup that will become the next Apple Computer . Now he is looking for service companies that have proven growth records , for example HMOs or money management firms , and continue to whiz along at a good clip . TA calls these financings " growth buyouts . " A case study : Jenny Craig International , the chain of weight-loss centers founded in 1981 by Sid and Jenny Craig . TA financed a $100 million leveraged recapitalization of the company in 1989 and received a seat on the board of directors . In 1991 , Jenny Craig had sales of $412 million , a 16% increase over 1990 , itself up a plump 99% , and earnings of $31 million . Now it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nutri-System . Says Landry , who joined TA after receiving his MBA from Wharton in 1968 : " We like companies that have long-term competitive products . " Human nature being what it is , that 's exactly what Jenny Craig has . Customers drop their excess weight , then gain it back and re-up for the program . Far from faulting the regimens as unsustainable fad diets , they blame themselves for lack of discipline . After all , they did lose the weight in the first place . The underlying characteristics of the service businesses TA invests in are good cash flow , low overhead , and a stream of revenues from the customer rather than from selling a few big-ticket items . These guidelines rule out technology fields such as computer hardware where the maddeningly short product cycles keep getting even briefer , in favor of software outfits , as well as money management firms and medical service companies . When they cashed out in the past , venture capitalists traditionally sold stock to the public . But that 's changing too . " In our business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Landry . " When we get outside the technical area , the entrepreneurs often ascribe some value to being private . Their friends and competitors are n't public , so that 's not a symbol of success for them . " TA must find other ways to get its money back , and these can include special dividends or a merger with another company . HIGH-TECH TRADITIONALISTS Shelley and Susanne Harrison Poly Ventures * The thread that runs through Shelley Harrison 's investments is a desire to link American innovation with Asian manufacturing skill . His first deal , in 1988 , came about because he discovered the American inventor of a high-performance computer printer that uses optical fibers rather than lasers . Harrison was intrigued by the chance to compete in a field dominated by the Japanese , who make the critical components of virtually all the laser printers sold in the U.S. , including those marketed under the Apple and Hewlett-Packard brands . Several major American companies turned down his invitation to invest in the printer company . " They yawned and said , " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' " Harrison recalls . So the dealmaker , who speaks Mandarin , set up a joint venture with Taiwanese investors to manufacture the products there . The company , Photon Imaging , plans to release a printer in 1993 with a resolution of 600 dots per inch , twice that of today 's standard Japanese-made , American-marketed laser printers . Harrison is co-founder of a determinedly high-tech venture capital firm , Poly Ventures , in suburban Farmingdale , Long Island . Its offices are on the graduate campus of the old Brooklyn Polytechnic  --  now called Polytechnic University  --  where Gordon Gould invented the laser . A New York City native , Harrison studied under Gould while pursuing his Ph.D . in laser physics . In 1973 he co-founded Symbol Technologies , which holds worldwide patents for its light , hand-held laser bar-code scanners that companies use to keep track of inventory . But Harrison left Symbol after its second public offering in 1981 to travel through the Far East and pursue life as a venture capitalist . In 1987 he raised $30 million from pension funds , insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his alma mater . Polytechnic University is a special limited partner in the company and gets 5% of the capital gains in return for giving Harrison 's group access to the university 's patents . Harrison , 49 , and his three partners  --  including his wife , Susanne , 47  --  raised a second fund of $23 million in 1991 . The idea is old-style venture capitalism : small-dollar equity stakes in high-tech startups . Poly Ventures has invested in 17 companies so far , and Harrison never goes anywhere without a small card bearing the home phone numbers of his 17 CE0s . LEVERAGE IN DISGUISE Theodore Forstmann and Brian Little , Forstmann Little Co. * The walls of Forstmann Little &; Co. ' s Manhattan offices are decorated with Depression-era posters . Aptly so , because the LBO firm does well in hard times . Between September 1988 and March 1990 , it did not make a single investment , looking a little foolish but determined to wait for the right opportunities . Then in 1991 , after prices had fallen , Forstmann raised $1.5 billion and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarries : Gulfstream Aerospace for $850 million and General Instrument for $1.75 billion . In forceful speeches and op-ed articles , Theodore Forstmann , 52 , has been a cranky critic of the irresponsible use of junk debt in 1980s deals , especially the kind practiced by his archrival a half block away , KKR . But while Forstmann has refused to finance his deals with junk bonds because they place perilous interest burdens on companies , his deals were , and continue to be , highly leveraged affairs . Like other firms , Forstmann has an equity fund , but its ace in the hole is a huge , $2 billion pool dedicated to buying subordinated debt from the companies it takes over . The firm 's way of crafting deals is illustrated by its purchase of Gulfstream . First , Forstmann put up half the money , over $400 million , from its own funds and then borrowed the other half from banks . One-quarter of the Forstmann contribution is equity . The rest is subordinated debt , paying one percentage point above the rate for five-year Treasury bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other quarter is equity . That means the overall debt-to-equity ratio is a hefty 7 to 1 , likely to magnify the ultimate rate of return and not much less than the lofty 10 to 1 common a few years ago . But thanks to the subordinated-debt fund , Forstmann does n't need to issue junk bonds or dubious payment-in-kind paper to complete its work . How did the firm line up such a big , cheap , captive source of debt ? Forstmann has a love-me , love-my-dog policy . The 20 limited partners  --  mainly pension funds , plus a few insurers , banks , and wealthy individuals  --  must contribute to this debt pool if they want a piece of the action in the lucrative equity fund . Although the details are n't subject to public disclosure and thus ca n't be checked , Forstmann claims an 87% annual rate of return for its completed equity investments over 12 years , subtracting the general partners fees and percentage of the profits . To improve the subordinated-debt fund 's rate of return  --  32% a year on completed investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal . THE LOW-TECHIES Stanley Golder , Carl Thoma , and Bryan Cressey Golder Thoma &; Cressey * When Stanley Golder , 63 , Carl Thoma , 42 , and Bryan Cressey , 42 , began working together at First Chicago 's venture capital arm in the mid-1970s , they backed a then-obscure upstart called Kohlberg Kravis Roberts . In 1980 they left the bank to start their own firm , Golder Thoma &; Cressey . Located in Chicago , far from the blandishments of Silicon Valley , they decided to specialize in low tech . GTC 's first deal , a beeper outfit called Paging Network , created a pioneering model that combined elements of venture capital , leverage , and empire building that the firm has imitated many times since . The model calls for finding a highly fragmented service industry ready for consolidation . Then the partners launch or buy a company and build it into the leading player by recruiting top managers and backing them in a series of acquisitions . The investment profits come partly from the effects of leverage  --  the deals usually have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and achieving economies of scale . Paging Network has brought its original investors 60 times their money . Rather than waiting for aspiring entrepreneurs to approach them , hat in hand , GTC comes up with its own ideas for new companies . Once the deal is done , a GTC partner may work close to full time with the company for as long as a year , often serving as chief financial officer . No passive investors here . GTC currently manages $400 million , with stakes in 30 companies in fields such as lawn care , propane distribution , fast-food restaurants , and printing . A typical deal : In 1989 the firm launched Golf Enterprises with the purchase of Jim Colbert Golf . The company , with 1991 sales of $29 million , now owns 19 public courses in seven states and is aiming for 100 courses by decade 's end . Because many public golf courses lose money , " this is a case when good management makes a huge difference , " says Cressey . So when Golf Enterprises buys a course , one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees do n't disappear into some employee 's pockets . Astonishingly , many courses do n't have registers . No wonder they do n't have profits either . KKR 'S COURSE CORRECTION William Reilly , Charles McCurdy , and Beverly Chell K-III Holdings * Now that the kind of huge deals it engineered in the 1980s are thin on the ground , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is taking a leaf from Golder Thoma 's book . KKR 's first " annual review , " which the habitually secretive firm released in early 1990 to explain its ways and deflect public criticism , announced an important new vehicle for future investments . The firm would create companies " by finding an experienced management team , backing them financially , and helping them build a business from scratch by acquiring several small companies in a related industry . The pilot effort is K-III Holdings , a partnership formed by KKR in January 1989 to acquire publishing companies . Prices had fallen to attractive levels in that industry because potential buyers could not find bank financing and most of them were reeling under enormous debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top executives from Macmillan : William Reilly , 53 , Charles McCurdy , 36 , and Beverly Chell , 49 . Together they own 25% of K-III . KKR , which had backed Reilly 's unsuccessful bid to save Macmillan from the depredations of Robert Maxwell , contributes the equity portion of K-III 's investments and owns the rest . Reilly says that K-III aims to build a publishing giant on the scale of the one he left , planning ultimately to take it public . So far he has ten acquisitions , including the Funk &; Wagnalls encyclopedia , the Daily Racing Form from Rupert Murdoch 's News America Corp. , and a passel of Murdoch 's consumer magazines . K-III 's properties also include scientific and professional books and trade publications , such as Ward 's Auto World . The companies had total revenues of $800 million in 1991 . Reilly 's deals have around 40% equity , with the rest coming from bank lending , which even in these parlous days is available to financiers with the KKR imprimatur . The buyout firm is busily cloning the K-III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Granum Communications to buy undervalued radio stations ; so far the partnership has bought two in Dallas and one in Orlando , Florida . In June , KKR launched a partnership with Cablevision Industries Corp. , a cable TV operator , and endowed it with $250 million of equity capital for buying cable companies . The first purchase , a 65,000-home system in Long Beach , California , was made for $132 million in December . DANCING AMID DESPAIR Sam Zell and David Schulte Zell/Chilmark Fund * It 's amazing how time can refine rough edges . For years Sam Zell , 50 , has preyed on troubled companies and distressed real estate , reveling in epithets such as " grave dancer " and " vulture capitalist . " In keeping with his roughneck persona , Zell motorcycles to his Chicago office and rarely wears ties , preferring sweat suits to dress suits . Outsider though he may be  --  at least by Wall Street standards  --  Zell 's time has most definitely come . Says he : " Restructuring is what I 've always done for a living . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990 , Zell raised $1 billion from pension funds , endowments , and foreign investors , dedicated solely to investments in troubled companies . The partnership , called the Zell/Chilmark Fund , is co-managed by David Schulte , 46 , a former Salomon Brothers investment banker , whose summer home is located in the Chilmark section of Martha 's Vineyard . Between 1988 and 1991 , Zell lined up another $1 billion in a separate fund for real estate investments . He was able to raise big money partly because he offered unusually favorable terms to his backers . Dealmakers typically charge their investors an annual fee of 1.25% to 2.5% of the money under management , plus 20% of any capital gains . Not Zell . Before he and Schulte may receive their 20% of the capital gains , they must achieve at least a 10% annual return for their limited partners and give back all management fees  --  often tens of millions of dollars . Zell is frank that these arrangements were " crucial " to attract such a large pool of capital . So far , Zell/Chilmark has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy 80% of the bonds of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. , the big West Coast department store owner , which had filed for Chapter 11 the previous February . In March it clinched a deal to buy 18% of the Revco chain of drug stores , also in bankruptcy , for up to $250 million . Zell propounds a contrarian view of real estate as well . When almost no one is buying , he is . " Our strategy is to buy the best-quality product in the best-quality location at below replacement cost , he says . " The real estate arena is full of despair . Every deal you want to do translates into a loss for someone else . You must convince the seller  --  99% of the time a financial institution  --  that it 's in his economic advantage to take the hit today rather than wait for recovery . " Never mind that it 's also to Zell 's advantage . <p>
