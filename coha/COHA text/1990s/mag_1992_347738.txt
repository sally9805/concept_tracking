When Bill Clinton was phoning world leaders the day after he won the election , he made a point of placing a call , right after talking with Britain 's John Major , to a farm in Worthington , Massachusetts . He wanted to thank Tony Lake , described by a campaign aide as the " heart and soul " of Clinton 's foreign policy team , for orchestrating the strategy that managed to neutralize voters ' concerns about Clinton 's inexperience on the world stage . Characteristically , Lake was not hanging around Little Rock or jockeying for West Wing office space . He had already returned to his cows , his close-knit family and his students at Mount Holyoke College . Friends tease him about being Cincinnatus , but his love of rural independence is no act . " I moved up here because I did not want to spend the next however many years of my life trying to get some job in Washington , " he says . " I just have a very happy life here . " But high office  --  National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . <P> He has been a popular and respected professor of international relations for 11 years , since leaving Jimmy Carter 's State Department , where he was director of policy planning . He is the author of five books on U.S. foreign policy . When he talks , his eyes are penetrating and his humor is wry . Described variously by associates as " a stalwart Puritan , " " immensely kind , " " the opposite of a self-promoter " and " a tough competitor , " he seems psychologically centered , surprisingly devoid of the egotism and Machiavellian qualities often found in presidential advisers . <P> Lake backed into the campaign . Last fall he was writing a book about how Republicans had managed to turn foreign policy against the Democrats in voters ' minds , and how Democrats might do better . He interviewed his former deputy at policy planning , Sandy Berger , who was directing the candidate 's foreign policy staff . Berger implored his old boss to act on his theories rather than write them up . After meeting with Clinton , Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mid-December . It was a hit , and Lake became Clinton 's senior national security adviser . <P> Working mostly by phone and fax with Berger and three other foreign policy analysts  --  Michael Mandelbaum , Nancy Soderberg and Leon Fuerth  --  Lake limited his traveling to Thursday through Monday so he could continue teaching . Clinton gave speeches stressing mainstream foreign policy themes : promoting democracy , a strong but revamped defense and the need for creative thinking on global problems like the environment . He counterpunched on Iraqgate and Irangate . On a few carefully chosen issues like aid to Russia , the need to help Somalia , and punishing Serbia for " ethnic cleansing " in Bosnia , the Democrat took positions slightly forward of Bush 's and waited for events to squeeze the President his way . He criticized the Bush Administration for being too cozy with authoritarian regimes , such as the one in China . Each of these cases reflects Lake 's view that American values and ideals should be a greater part of the foreign policy equation , in contrast to the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Baker .
