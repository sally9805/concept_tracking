<p> IT 'S not unusual to purchase a property in Argentina with a hefty stack of $ 100 bills from the United States . <p> Expensive horses have been bought in Saudi Arabia for a couple of " bricks " of $ 100 dollar bills , each brick containing $ 400,000 , still shrink-wrapped as when they left the US Federal Reserve . <p> Duty-free shops in Manila and taxi cabs in Hanoi , Vietnam , gladly take dollars . <p> Around the world , American currency - cold , green cash - turns many wheels of commerce . <p> " The growth in the use of United States currency abroad in the past five or six years has been extraordinary , " says Dorothy Bradbury , deputy assistant US Treasury secretary for federal finance . <p> Favored for its relatively stable value and the backing of the world 's largest economy , US cash outside the nation 's borders now totals more than $ 263 billion , up from about $ 100 billion in 1985 , the Fed estimates . <p> How much cash is $ 263 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills , there would be roughly one for every two people , excluding Americans . <p> In a world of many uncertain , unstable currencies , dollars in a sugar bowl or under the mattress often provide a measure of certainty and stability for those who can obtain them . <p> Seeking refuge against hyperinflation or a sudden currency devaluation are only the most prominent reasons for the dollar 's resilience . People also use greenbacks as a currency for illegal drug deals , to avoid red tape of local regulations , and as an almost universal means of payment by tourists . <p> The trend is global , Ms. Bradbury says . Greenbacks are in demand in South America , Central America , Asia , the Middle East , Eastern Europe , Russia , and Africa . <p> Dialing for ( pallets of ) dollars <p> How does so much money get overseas in the first place ? <p> Some is carried in pockets and purses , such as when Mexicans working in America return to visit their families . <p> Much flows through the international banking system , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or computer chips . Crisp bills are shipped by the pallet-load to those who can afford to buy and use them . <p> " If a business or an individual overseas wants cash in exchange for a deposit account in his bank , or for another currency , we are usually glad to do it for an exchange fee , as long as it is legal , " says an official of a large American commercial bank with extensive international operations . <p> The East Coast bank is one of several that supply US currency to overseas banks and businesses . The official asked not to be identified , in part because these banks became publicity-shy after media reports of counterfeit $ 100 bills traveling the globe . <p> In many nations , cash dollars are in decline , a result of governments stabilizing currencies or leaving a communist past behind . <p> Former East Bloc bastions Russia and Poland are examples . And for now , the buck is less than almighty in Brazil and Israel ( see related articles , right ) . <p> In Poland , recent stabilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of Communist rule there , hard-currency stores sold Western goods for dollars . <p> After communism collapsed in 1989 , with Poland 's free market still struggling , the dollar was in common use . Inflation was a problem , and the zloty , the local currency , was not convertible into hard currencies such as dollars . Now , with the zloty recently made convertible and inflation largely under control , the dollar 's role is diminishing . <p> In Russia , the ruble has stabilized somewhat , and so use of the dollar has eased . And the central bank has kept the dollar-ruble exchange rate in a fairly narrow corridor , so the dollar is no longer useful as an inflation hedge . But Russians may still be holding up to $ 20 billion in American cash , the preferred way of keeping savings . Banks are not trusted , so dollars are harbored in tool cupboards , books , and under mattresses . <p> Firms owned wholly by Russians are forbidden to price goods in anything but rubles . So many companies simply mark prices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dollars . <p> The Philippines may have a very different political past , but here , too , the dollar as cold cash seems to have lost some of its allure . The reason : the complete lifting of foreign-exchange controls in early 1993 and the related weakening of the dollar against the Philippine peso . <p> Dollars are no longer saved in cash in the Philippines as a hedge against inflation because the peso has been so strong . Bolstering demand for the peso are remittances from Filipino contract workers overseas . <p> While no longer hoarding dollars in bank vaults , Filipinos still keep dollars for travel or for purchases in duty-free shops in Manila . Duty-free goods are now available for pesos in free port zones such as Subic and Clark , both of which hosted US bases until recently . <p> Until this summer , global demand for dollars had been growing at about 8 to 10 percent a year , but in June and July the growth stopped . The growth resumed in August , but at an annual rate of about 6 percent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear why the growth flattened in the summer , says a Fed spokesman , nor does the Fed have statistics that prove the flattening was due to overseas factors , although this is suspected . The currency supply in the US changes at a much steadier pace , overseas only as they are demanded . So the currency stabilization in various parts of the world cuts the demand in those areas . <p> Other factors can reduce demand for dollars . One example is widespread worry in Russia that older US $ 100 bills will become obsolete early in 1996 when the Treasury offers a new $ 100 bill . <p> Another factor could be the growing importance of the Japanese yen or German mark in some areas . <p> In Bosnia , the German currency is commonly used alongside the Bosnian dinar , while greenbacks puzzle shopkeepers . <p> In Asia , Japan 's growing investment has boosted the yen 's role in business circles . But on the street , the paper money of choice is still the dollar ; yen are often accepted at a discount to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not necessarily dollars . Citizens have a long tradition of stashing money under mattresses , a habit bred by low interest rates during more than four decades of communist rule . Economists there say citizens hold $ 25 billion at home . Some is in foreign currencies , but little in dollars . <p> The Chinese renminbi has appreciated during the last two years , and many people now prefer to hold their savings in this national currency . <p> Chinese fortunate enough to have passports and who travel use dollars , mainly to buy items at duty-free stores . Friends and family often ask these travelers to buy big-ticket items for them , such as foreign-made television sets and videocassette recorders . <p> Passing up pesos <p> But if the dollar 's role has diminished in some country 's , it remains strong in others . <p> In Mexico , the peso 's 55-percent decline in value against the dollar this year has boosted demand for dollars . Advertisements for expensive goods such as computers or rental houses in upper-crust neighborhoods are now seen more often in dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of Mexican business owners - envious perhaps of humble Mexican migrants who earn dollars in the US - proposed they be allowed to open dollar-based bank accounts within Mexico . The unfolding saga of Raul Salinas de Gortari ( brother of a former Mexican president ) , with his $ 100-million-plus in Swiss and other accounts , reminds Mexicans that dollar accounts outside the country are nothing new to some in their society . <p> Africa was never colonized by the US , but the dollar is the foremost currency across much of that continent - even in former French colonies . It is readily accepted in restaurants , in many hotels , and by almost anyone on the street . <p> In Sierra Leone and Mozambique , countries worn down by vicious civil wars , the dollar is even more widely used . War-torn Angola has tried to crack down on traders who exchange money on the streets , but people still do it , partly to get better rates than in official exchange houses .. <p> Only those clued in know where the traders lurk , and trades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trader was met . <p> In Burma , one can get 120 kyats , the local currency , for $ 1 on the black market . But the government maintains an official rate of just under six kyats to the dollar . <p> To appease foreigners and to absorb as much of the black market as possible , the government offers Foreign Exchange Certificates , worth $ 1 , which can be exchanged for 100 kyats each . <p> Counterfeiters galore <p> With the popularity of the dollar has come competition from counterfeiters . <p> As the US Treasury prepares to fight back by issuing harder-to-copy $ 100 bills in 1996 , many people in other nations worry that the new bills will make their dollars worthless . Some businesses in Russia have stopped accepting $ 100 bills . <p> The US government is waging an information campaign in many parts of the world , including Russia , to inform people that all existing legitimate US currency will continue to be good , says Ms. Bradbury of the Treasury . Ad agencies are being hired in many countries to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it issues a new note , but relies on commercial banks to trade in worn-out bills for new ones . By contrast , when some governments issue new notes , the old ones are sometimes not accepted in exchange , as has happened in Russia . Holders simply lost their money . <p> Part of the problem in Russia , though , has been the presence of counterfeit $ 100 bills , some of which are quite similar to authentic bills . According to Bradbury , some discounting is going on in Russia in unofficial ( nonbanking ) circles now when people exchange dollars for rubles . An international banker with Bank of America , based in San Francisco , says some Russians may be doing this discounting out of concern about counterfeit bills , which they will not be able to exchange in banks for the new $ 100 bills . <p> Africa also has its share of counterfeit $ 100 bills , and many hotels now wo n't accept any $ 100 bills . <p> Two investigative news reports in the US this year - one in Reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotlighted an alleged counterfeit operation abroad printing $ 100 bills that are supposedly very hard to detect as false . Reportedly these bills have reached Russia and other countries in large numbers . The two articles do not agree on either the geographic location of the alleged operation or on the number of bills supposedly put in circulation . <p> Reader 's Digest , whose article appeared last March , cites Iran as the source of the slick counterfeit $ 100 bills , while The New Yorker , whose article appeared seven months later and did not mention the Reader 's Digest piece , cites Lebanon and Syria as possible counterfeiting sites . <p> Seizures of counterfeit US currency abroad by the US Secret Service jumped to $ 120 million in 1993 from $ 30 million in 1992 . In July of 1993 , a House Republican task force released a report on how Iran was fi this is certainly one area . <p> Bradbury says that credit card and check fraud far outstrips all counterfeiting efforts . <p> Treasury officials have made a number of trips this year to interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations all over the world . They say that detection of counterfeits is handled ably in almost all cases . These officials also say the new $ 100 bill will keep US currency-printing technology well ahead of increasingly sophisticated methods available to counterfeiters . <p> Many nations have seen use of cash dollars by citizens decline as they control inflation or leave a communist past behind . Former East bloc bastions Russia and Poland are examples .
