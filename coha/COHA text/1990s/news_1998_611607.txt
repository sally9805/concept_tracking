<p> Aggressive police action on minor criminal offenses and traffic violations apparently helped reduce the number of homicides in the District and Prince George 's County last year to levels not seen in a decade . But police officials and researchers agree that declining drug use by adults and a smaller population of young people set the stage for the historic reduction in slayings . <p> Police often blame " factors beyond our control " when crime is on the rise , then try to take credit when crime falls . But killings fell so sharply in Washington and Prince George 's last year  --  by 24 percent in the city and 42 percent in the county  --  that even many skeptics concede police work in both jurisdictions had something to do with the drop . <p> Several analysts said the sudden reduction in homicides and other violent crime may mean the Washington area finally is joining other urban areas across the country experiencing dramatic declines in crime . The driving forces behind the national trend remain hotly debated , but higher incarceration rates , a strong economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population and more effective policing are among the factors cited . <p> Police officials in both jurisdictions acknowledged that residents continue to live in fear and to complain that there are n't enough officers in their neighborhoods . <p> " I think we 're on the right track in preventing crime , but we have a long way to go in dealing with the perception of crime , " D.C. police Assistant Chief Robert C. White said . " There 's a real disconnect between what we 're doing and the community feeling the difference . It does n't matter how much of an impact we have if communities do n't feel they 're safer . " <p> Months before he retired amid scandal in November , D.C. Police Chief Larry D. Soulsby ordered several hundred officers back onto city streets to enforce a " zero tolerance " crackdown on minor offenses . For the year , arrests in the District were up about 20 percent over 1996 , D.C. officials reported , and almost all of the increase was for minor crimes such as drinking in public . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of dollars in overtime for officers to patrol high-crime areas , stop cars and search for firearms . The strategy resulted in officers more than doubling the number of traffic stops in 1996 and seizing 40 percent more guns . <p> It is impossible to say whether the traffic stops in Prince George 's and the new deployment in the District caused the sharp decline in killings . But in New York , crime plummeted to 30-year lows after police put hundreds more officers on patrol in problem areas and ordered them to attack such low-level offenses as spraying graffiti and playing loud music . <p> Researchers said last year 's policing changes in Washington and Prince George 's may have tipped the balance or accelerated an inevitable decline . Drug use among adult arrestees in Washington has been declining slowly for several years , and the number of young people  --  who are considered more likely to commit crimes  --  also has been shrinking . <p> " If you think about crime increasing , there 's no single thing that explains an upward trend , " said Dennis Kenney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law enforcement think tank in the District . " The same thing works in the opposite direction . <p> " I suspect the ability of the police to reduce crime is not a stand-alone ability . When you have conditions causing crime to decline , then changes in police activity can accelerate and contribute to that trend , " Kenney said . <p> In Washington , there was a 19 percent drop in all reported crime last year , including an 18 percent reduction in all violent crimes . D.C. police reported that 301 people were killed in 1997 , compared with 396 the year before . The number of homicides remained high for a city Washington 's size , but it was the lowest number the District has recorded since 1987 . <p> The drop in violent crime in Prince George 's was led by the decline in homicides : 83 last year , compared with 142 in 1996 . The 1997 figure was the lowest for any year since 1986 . County police have not finished compiling overall crime statistics , but Farrell said gun-related violence dropped about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The steep drop in homicides shared by the District and Prince George 's did not extend to other large jurisdictions in the area , where there are far fewer killings and the fluctuations are less significant statistically . Fairfax County recorded 16 killings last year , up from 14 the year before , and Montgomery County had 22 homicides last year , compared with 13 a year earlier and an average 25 a year during the 1990s . <p> Officials said the decline in killings in Prince George 's and the District could mark the end of the intense violence that began in 1987 , when crack cocaine unleashed a wave of crime in several communities in the eastern half of the District and western Prince George 's . The epidemic transformed the District 's quality of life and fueled the flight of middle-class families that has crippled the city . <p> The violence peaked in 1991 , when both the District and Prince George 's had record-high numbers of slayings , a combined 643 . <p> Police officials , prosecutors and detectives in both jurisdictions said the sharpest drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that skyrocketed during the crack invasion . Some officers and analysts said that suggests the crack market has matured and that there are fewer turf battles occurring among drug dealers now . <p> Tests conducted by the District 's Pretrial Services Agency document the decline in demand for crack , though they also show record marijuana use among juveniles . The agency said 39 percent of adult arrestees and 6 percent of juvenile arrestees tested positive for cocaine last year , compared with 64 percent and 22 percent , respectively , in 1988 . <p> " The crack cocaine epidemic has slowed , and that certainly has had an impact , " White said . " We still have a severe drug problem and serious gang problems but not of the magnitude of the early ' 90s . " <p> But White said the D.C. police deserve a large share of the credit for last year 's decline in crime . He explained that 500 officers were moved from desk jobs and specialty units onto street patrols in June , when the department replaced its 138 scout-car beats with 83 new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each area are responsible for developing and implementing strategies to reduce crime , he said , and officers who do n't succeed are demoted or transferred . <p> " It 's important to have people being territorial and responding to a specific area all the time , " White said . " Then , they can focus all of their energy on the same problems , and the department can hold people accountable . " <p> Many officers have been enforcing the department 's zero-tolerance policy on quality-of-life offenses such as urinating in public . The theory is that the crackdown will help restore order to communities and that criminals will be less willing to carry a gun for fear of getting stopped for other violations . <p> White said that officers made 57,836 arrests citywide last year , compared with 48,003 in 1996 , and that almost all of the increase could be attributed to arrests for less serious offenses . <p> Although much of the attention focused on the D.C. police department in 1997 was negative  --  from widespread mismanagement chronicled by consultants hired by the D.C. financial control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieutenant who was indicted on an extortion charge  --  researchers said that Soulsby 's deployment of more officers on the street probably had the greatest effect on crime . <p> After the consultants found that two-thirds of the department 's 3,600-member force made 10 or fewer arrests each year and that only 16 percent of the officers were available for daily patrols , Soulsby sent more officers to the street . When it became public that homicide detectives were solving only about one-third of their cases , he replaced all the supervisors in the unit . <p> " The personal conduct of the chief may not have a lot to do with what 's happening on the streets , " said Lawrence Sherman , chairman of the Criminology Department at the University of Maryland at College Park . " The biggest problem was the tiny percentage of the force on patrol . To the extent that changed , that alone could easily account for major reductions in crime . " <p> Sherman and other criminologists said the situation in Prince George 's is more clear-cut . " That 's much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and developing a strategic plan to reduce crime and relentlessly implementing it , " Sherman said . <p> Prince George 's County Executive Wayne K. Curry ( D ) recruited Farrell from the Metro-Dade Police Department in the Miami area two years ago and entrusted him with broad authority to run the county police force . Since then , the chief has expanded community policing , launched a crackdown on open-air drug markets and focused extra patrols on " hot spots " of crime identified by computer mapping . <p> Although Curry has set aside funds to expand the department to 1,400 officers , Farrell said the department 's biggest challenge remains manpower . The county has fewer than two officers per 1,000 residents , compared with the District , which has more than six officers per 1,000 residents . <p> Farrell sought to overcome the manpower shortage by getting more help from the FBI and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and by using overtime funds to pay officers to work additional time to patrol high-crime areas , make traffic stops and search for guns . The idea is to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as catch criminals . <p> Farrell said officers stopped more than 2 1/2 times as many motorists last year  --  48,289 stops , compared with 18,445 the year before . At one point during the summer , the department ran out of tickets to give motorists because the state could n't provide them fast enough . <p> At the same time , Farrell said , serious complaints against officers fell 13 percent , and preliminary figures indicate that gun seizures climbed about 40 percent , from 1,345 in 1996 to 1,902 last year . <p> " The bottom line is homicides ended up down 40 percent , and I think a lot of that had to do with this tremendous increase in traffic stops , " Farrell said . " The beneficial effect really comes when you deter those who otherwise would break the law . " <p> John Eck , a criminologist at the University of Maryland at College Park , noted that both Prince George 's and the District have " focused attention on the uniformed branches doing basic cop stuff " in high-crime areas , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime . He said the shrinking population of young people in both jurisdictions also might have affected the decline . <p> According to U.S. Census estimates , the number of people ages 18 to 24 in Washington fell 44 percent from 1990 to 1996 ; in Prince George 's , the population in that age group fell 14 percent during those years . <p> " If crack had not declined , if the population had not aged , the policing might not have had as much of an impact , " Eck said . " But neither of those trends would explain a decline as sharp as we 've seen without the police pressure . " <p> Staff writers Maria Elena Fernandez and Brooke A. Masters contributed to this report .
