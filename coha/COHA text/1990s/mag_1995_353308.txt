Last weekend marked the 25th anniversary of Earth Day . Not coincidentally , it also marked the 25th anniversary of Earth Shoes . An appreciation : <P> What are Earth Shoes ? They were the first shoes to be marketed with a " negative heel " - meaning their heels were actually lower than their raised toes . This was said to mimic the effect of walking in sand and to make for orthopedically superior posture . In appearance , Earth Shoes pioneered the flanged , boxy look that epitomized much ' 70s design and can be seen in such later icons of the decade as Bruce Jenner 's hair and the A.M.C. Pacer . <P> Did Earth Shoes originate somewhere in Scandinavia ? No , Milan . <P> Really ? No . Of course they 're from Scandinavia . Designed in 1957 by a Copenhagen yoga instructor named Anne Kals , the shoes were first marketed in the U.S. under license by Raymond and Eleanor Jacobs in 1970 . Impressed by Earth Day crowds gathering near their just opened store in New York City , the Jacobses made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that very day from Anne Kals Minus Heel Shoes to Earth Shoes . From a marketing standpoint , it was probably a wise move . Indeed , the couple soon found themselves presiding over a multimillion-dollar business . At the height of their popularity , Earth Shoes were available in dozens of styles : sandals , clogs , hiking shoes and deluxe , fleece-lined ankle boots . Sales peaked in 1974 ; in 1977 , after a dispute with banks , the company was placed in bankruptcy and Earth Shoes went the way of quadraphonic Helen Reddy albums  --  though the former have a place in the permanent collection of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City . <P> Did Al Gore used to wear Earth Shoes ? The Vice President told TIME that he can not remember whether or not he ever had a pair . <P> Where do the top footwear tastemakers of the ' 90s stand vis-e-vis Earth Shoes ? Manolo Blahnik , the pre-eminent European shoe designer , is an unabashed Earth Shoe fan : " It was the first shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social statement ! " American shoe designer Kenneth Cole is another fan : " What was originally an antifashion statement 25 years ago has today become fashionable . They are a relaxed and comfortable alternative to other fashionable footwear . " <P> They 're really coming back ? A Manhattan boutique specializing in trendy ' 70s memorabilia reports a sales boomlet in vintage Earth Shoes . And negative-heeled shoes continue to be manufactured by the Roots shoe company of Canada ; demand is reported to be highest in Japan . By LINA LOFARO
