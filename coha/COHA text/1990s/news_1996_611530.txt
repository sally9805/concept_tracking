<p> Here in one of the most fervently pro-military cities in the country , the civic culture has long embraced new defense installations with patriotic zeal . If the Pentagon wanted to open or expand a base , the huge community of military retirees could be counted on to welcome it with open arms . <p> That is , until the Marine Corps decided to move eight squadrons of CH-53 Super Stallion and CH-46 Sea Knight transport helicopters from two soon-to-be-closed Marine air bases in Orange County to the Miramar Naval Air Station here  --  and walked straight into a minefield . <p> The planned transfer ignited a barrage of opposition by local residents  --  many former career military people who do not want helicopters flying over their houses for safety , noise and environmental reasons . When the Navy Department gave final approval to the move earlier this month , the residents found themselves in the unexpected position of preparing a lawsuit against the government many of them spent a lifetime sworn to defend . <p> The Miramar controversy also has led to an unlikely coalition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from such liberal Democrats as Sen. Barbara Boxer and Rep. Bob Filner , a civil rights activist from San Diego , to Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham , a conservative Republican and decorated Navy fighter pilot during the Vietnam War . Also opposed is San Diego Mayor Susan Golding , a Republican who has worked to diversify the city 's economy beyond the military into high-tech and other industries . <p> Calling the Miramar decision " nonsensical " and more costly than locating the helicopters 100 miles north at the more remote March Air Force Base in Riverside , Filner said he and Boxer will introduce legislation aimed at blocking Pentagon spending for the transfer . <p> Fueling the outrage was a decision by the Pentagon this month to transfer a Marine helicopter base in Okinawa to a nearly mile-long offshore platform it will build to satisfy Japanese concerns over noise and danger . If Defense officials could go to such lengths to accommodate the residents of Okinawa , the San Diego critics contend , why could not they do the same here ? <p> " It 's an odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff Frederick , who flew F-4 Phantom fighters in five tours in Vietnam and retired in 1985 . " Most senior officers , when they first heard about the opposition to this transfer , were pretty angry . We 're generally very patriotic and loyal people . <p> " But when we saw the environmental impact statements and the proposed flight paths , a lot of old military types got pretty worked up , " Frederick said . He bought a house 12 miles north of Miramar , well out of the flight path of the Navy F-14 Tomcat fighters that operated there until the Navy decided to move its squadrons , including the elite " Top Gun " command , out of that base . <p> The immediate object of the residents ' anger is the ear-splitting thwack thwack thwack of the rotors of the 13,000-horsepower CH-53s as they fly overhead and the possibility that someday one of them may malfunction and plummet like a stone onto houses below , or worse , collide with another aircraft in the darkness of night . <p> " We 've been around these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems there are . This is the second busiest airspace in the country , " said Frederick , who also used to fly Navy helicopters . <p> Another opponent , Richard Hertzberg , a former Coast Guard lieutenant commander , said that on environmental grounds alone , the decision to move the helicopters to Miramar should never have been made . An estimated 673,000 people live in or immediately adjacent to the planned flight paths . <p> The helicopters and their supporting infrastructure will emit 1,600 tons of air pollutants a year , said Hertzberg , a commercial power company executive . Even though power companies spend $ 45 billion a year to comply with the Clean Air Act , he said , the Pentagon pushed aside a report by the Environmental Protection Agency indicating the helicopters could degrade the air quality around Miramar more than the Navy estimated . <p> Other opponents said a pair of the low-flying helicopters will produce noise levels double that needed to wake up residents and half again as much as is needed to impair normal conversation . <p> But there is a deeper anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is arrogance and disingenuousness on the part of the Pentagon in pushing through the transfer of the 112 helicopters in the face of credible evidence that they could have just as easily been deployed to March AFB . <p> Jerry Hargarten , a World War II Navy veteran and retired DuPont Co. executive , has a modernistic , rambling home with a spectacular view he does not want downgraded by the helicopters . Hargarten , who heads an opposition group called Move Against Relocating Choppers Here ( MARCH ) , accused the Marine command of making the decision to transfer the helicopters and then putting together the paperwork to justify it . <p> " They were well down the road on this plan and never dreamed it would be opposed by people who are very patriotic , very conservative and very favorable to the Navy and Marine Corps . They felt they had to defend it anyway , " Hargarten said . He said he believes the original decision against moving the helicopters to March AFB stemmed partly from a reluctance by the Marine Corps to share a base with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local residents , in Hargarten 's view , came when the Defense Department announced on Dec. 2  --  the same day the Pentagon gave final approval to the Miramar transfer  --  that a U.S. military helicopter base in Okinawa will be transferred to a planned 4,900-foot offshore platform as a way to reduce the noise and danger of flight operations on the southern Japanese island . <p> " That to me defines the arrogance of the Department of Defense . They move to reduce the danger of helicopters to Japanese civilians the very same day they turn their backs on the fears of San Diego residents , " Hargarten said . " That turned a lot of pro-military people against the military . We have no other recourse but to go to court . " Added Frederick : " I 've served my whole career in the military , but my pride in the service motivates me to pin them to the wall on this . Right now the military has a bad reputation in this town . " <p> A Marine Corps spokesman at the Pentagon , Maj. Scott Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a " comprehensive and significant way " by the environmental impact statement and a supplemental report that was not required and that delayed the final approval by nearly six months . Campbell called the Okinawa decision an " apples and oranges comparison , " noting most of the $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion cost of the offshore platform will be borne by Japan . He said the intent of the decision by the federal Base Closure and Realignment Commission to close the Tustin and El Toro bases in Orange County was to save money , although he acknowledged the decision to transfer the helicopters to Miramar was made by the Marine Corps . <p> " There was an effort by the Navy to be extra sure the concerns of the community were heard , considered and addressed , " Campbell said , noting that flight paths were altered , minimum operating altitudes raised and other changes made to accommodate safety and environmental objections . He denied that the quality of life in the area would be adversely impacted and said that a survey shows that a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president of the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce , which has supported the move , said it will bring about $ 500 million a year to the local economy , in addition to the nearly $ 400 million to be spent building new barracks , hangars , landing pads and other facilities . <p> " You have to stand back and look at this realistically . Without the helicopters , the base Miramar can not be justified . If the base closes , we have a tremendous hole in our economy , " he said . He said defense-related spending accounts for nearly $ 10 billion a year , or 13 percent of San Diego 's economy , and that the military has to be accommodated . <p> " The Chamber of Commerce does look at the military as a business partner , " Ledford said . " If we challenge the legitimate actions of our military , we 're only hurting ourselves . "
