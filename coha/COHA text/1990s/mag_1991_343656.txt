If there is any specimen lower than a fornicating preacher , it must be a shady scientist . The dissolute evangelist betrays his one revealed Truth , but the scientist who rushes half-cocked into print or , worse yet , falsifies the data subverts the whole idea of truth . Cold fusion in a teacup ? Or , as biologists ( then at M.I.T. ) David Baltimore and Thereza Imanishi-Kari claimed in a controversial 1986 article that the National Institutes of Health has now judged to be fraudulent , genes from one mouse mysteriously " imitating " those from another ? Sure , and parallel lines might as well meet somewhere or apples leap back up onto trees . <P> Baltimore , the Nobel laureate and since 1990 president of Rockefeller University , has apologized , after a fashion , for his role in the alleged fraud , and many feel that the matter should be left to rest . He did n't , after all , falsify the data himself ; he merely signed on as senior scientist to Imanishi-Kari 's now discredited findings . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whistle , Baltimore pooh-poohed O'Toole 's evidence and stood by while she lost her job . Then , as the feds closed in , he launched a bold , misguided defense of the sanctity of science . <P> What does one more lie matter anyway ? Politicians " misspeak " and are forgiven by their followers . Pop singers have been known to dub in better voices . Literary deconstructionists say there 's no truth anyway , just ideologies and points of view . Lies , you might say , are the great lubricant of our way of life . They sell products , flatter the powerful , appease the electorate and save vast sums from the IRS . Imanishi-Kari 's lie did n't even hurt anyone : no bridges fell , no patients died . <P> But science is different , and the difference does define a kind of sanctity . Although we think of it as the most secular of human enterprises , there is a little-known spiritual side to science , with its own stern ethical implications . Through research , we seek to know that ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't sound so tame and beaten , or God if the word were n't loaded with so much human hope and superstition . Think of it more neutrally as the nameless Subject of so much that happens , like the It in " It is raining " : something " out there " and vastly different from ourselves , but not so alien that we can not hope to know Its ways . <P> When I was a graduate student in biology  --  at Rockefeller , where Baltimore also earned his Ph.D .  --  I would have winced at all this metaphysics . The ethos of the acolyte was humility and patience . If the experiment did n't succeed , you did it again and then scratched your head and tried a new approach . There were mistakes , but mistakes could be corrected , which is why you reported exactly how you did things , step by step , so others could prove you right or wrong . There were even , sometimes , corners cut : a little rounding off , an anomalous finding overlooked .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
