CBS AFFILIATE GOES POSTAL OVER LETTERMAN <P> Sometimes even small guys like to flex their muscles . Nick Evans , owner of Spartan Communications , a CBS affiliate , was miffed when some advertiser-friends of his had trouble getting into the Late Show with DAVID LETTERMAN . Seats were found for them eventually but apparently not fast enough . Evans yanked the show off the air for a week on the six stations he runs because of " the arrogance of the Letterman organization and the weak ratings , " he says . Viewers were treated instead to infomercials , reruns of Married ... with Children and Judge Judy . Perhaps that 's why a local lawyer filed an informal complaint against Evans with the FCC . <P> ATTABOY , ATATURK <P> It 's the fight over Cyprus all over again , starring ANTONIO BANDERAS this time .

Though this is his initial venture in film production , he 'd enlisted Bruce Beresford as director and , according to the New York Times , had managed to get a lot of the financing on the strength of Banderas ' participation .

Photo rights are haggled over by magazines ; impressive sums of money are paid to the couple 's charity of choice in return for access . But MACAULEY CULKIN and RACHEL MINER , who got married at the perilously young age of 17 last month and only now have released ( free of charge ! ) their photos , did n't play that game . Cynics may remark that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each . Romantics , which these two seem to be , might insist that they are young , in love and nothing else matters . Take a look at the picture : two out of three ai n't bad . <P> THE LONG WALK TO REMARRIAGE <P> When you 've spent 27 years in prison , every birthday is precious . NELSON MANDELA of South Africa made his 80th even more so by marrying his sweetheart , GRACA MACHEL , 52 , the widow of a former President of Mozambique and an advocate for international child welfare . Rumors of wedlock had been rife , but Mandela had betrayed no hint of matrimony , even as he received birthday gifts early on Saturday at the presidential residence in Pretoria . Then , in the afternoon , a press conference of " national importance " was announced , luring reporters from Mandela 's home outside Johannesburg . With the press out of the way , the couple were wed in a private ceremony .
