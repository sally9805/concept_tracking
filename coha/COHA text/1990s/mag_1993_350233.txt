Bill Clinton and H. Ross Perot may be reluctant to acknowledge it , but the U.S.-Mexican border is already wide open to trade and likely to remain so whether the North American Free Trade Agreement passes Congress or not . In Laredo , Texas , last week 18-wheelers thundered back and forth on I-35 , hauling American-made computers , machine tools and other goods to Mexico and bringing back Mexican-produced TVs , beer and foodstuffs . At the same time , Mexican shoppers streamed across the Rio Grande to splurge at Laredo 's glittering Mall Del Norte , where retailers such as Sears and B. Dalton books are often packed . " NAFTA or no NAFTA , free trade is here , " says Kiko Zuniga , a Laredo businessman who has built three warehouses to handle the flow of merchandise . " All NAFTA can do is increase our sale of goods . " <P> This booming two-way commerce reflects a recent transformation that has brought free markets to Mexico . The impact extends far beyond border towns and deep into the American heartland , which sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began lowering its trade barriers , annual U.S. exports to the Latin American country have more than tripled , to nearly $41 billion . That has turned a U.S. trade deficit with Mexico of $5.2 billion in 1986 into a $4.7 billion surplus last year . " Almost all the real effects of NAFTA have already happened , " says Paul Krugman , an M.I.T. economist . " Mexico has already had the big liberalization . We 're talking not about an investment boom that 's going to happen , but one that 's under way now . " Many American companies with a foothold in Mexico 's market of 88 million people have ambitious expansion plans there regardless of NAFTA 's fate . Dallas-based Southland Corp . operates 180 7-Eleven stores with joint-venture partners in Mexico and will open 20 more by the end of the year . Wal-Mart opened a block- long supercenter in Mexico City in September , along with five Sam 's Clubs warehouse stores . The Arkansas-based company is completing a second supercenter in Monterey , Mexico , this month , plus two more warehouse clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1994 , and plans to build more than 50 outlets over the next five years . <P> Almost all the things Perot and other NAFTA critics say are going to happen if the agreement is signed have already happened . The largest  --  and most controversial  --  migrants to Mexico have been the automakers and other big manufacturing firms that have built assembly plants , or maquiladoras , along the border and employ low-wage Mexican labor . This process has been going on for more than 20 years . The factories export the vast bulk of their output , basically duty-free , back to the U.S. Some 2,200 maquiladoras , most of them American-owned , employ more than 500,000 Mexican workers . Not only has the shifting of the facilities to Mexico cost some Americans their jobs , but lax environmental standards and poorly enforced regulations have turned large stretches of the 2,000-mile border into toxic cesspools . Maquiladoras are blamed for the noxious brown cloud that often overhangs El Paso , Juarez and other cities , as well as for the foul wastes that flow into the Rio Grande @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
