* An affable , articulate former French paratrooper , Alain Gomez , 53 , is one of the biggest men in European electronics . The chairman of France 's state-owned electronics giant , Thomson ( 1991 sales : $12.7 billion ) , he has run out of patience . After ten years of battling the Japanese , he believes Europe is in danger of losing many of its high-tech industries . He has reason to worry . While Thomson 's $6.3 billion defense business remains profitable , losses mount in chips and consumer electronics . To keep those two divisions alive , the French government intends to merge them into CEA Industrie , its profitable nuclear power company . In an interview with managing editor Marshall Loeb and London bureau chief Carla Rapoport , Gomez argued for radical action against the Japanese . He knows his opinions on protectionism are extreme , but they do reflect a darkening mood in parts of Europe : As you look at the future , what is your biggest concern ? The Japanese will get 30% of the European car market by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can European carmakers survive ? I do n't know . At Thomson we have two major businesses in their firing line  --  one , semiconductors , has been deeply wounded , and the other , consumer electronics , is next on the list . In consumer electronics the Japanese have 50% of the market . Thomson and Philips are the only major European survivors . Autos and electronics are Japan 's equivalent today of the imperial army and navy of the 1930s and 1940s . The main problem is pressure on prices . Japanese wage costs are not so much different from ours . Labor costs are not the issue . The issue is twofold : They control their own distribution networks , which allows them to sell at higher prices at home than abroad . And the whole Japanese system is an industrial war machine . What can we do about it ? We can try to develop a defensive strategy  --  to gain time , to survive until something changes . One thing that wo n't change is Japan  --  at least not in time . Western governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's go back to economic theory . The Western world has been infected by liberal economics , just like the intelligentsia was seduced by Marxism in the 1930s . The members of the British establishment who joined the ring of five in Cambridge and spied on the West for Moscow are like the guys today who espouse Adam Smith and David Ricardo . Free trade has become a new kind of fanaticism . This causes great delight to our Japanese competitors , who just do n't believe their eyes . But the basis of that free-trade doctrine does n't stand up any longer in the era of high-tech industries . It rested on the notion that competitive advantages were given out fairly by God  --  Portugal made wine , England cloth , and so forth  --  for the benefit of the whole world market . But when you get to high tech , anyone with the necessary will and means can grab the advantage . Once they have it , they can keep it . They can light a heavy financial and human resources fire under R &D; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricing , and continue to keep others out . This is exactly what Japan did . Now , David Ricardo 's comparative advantage system can work only if the system remains static and industry does n't advance . If you can preempt the comparative advantage and keep it , then the system will work only for the benefit of the preemptor , such as Japan today . So let 's forget about Adam Smith and David Ricardo . Comparative advantage is not an excuse sent by God for being subdued . It 's something to be conquered or , in our case , recovered . And for that you need money and time , which equals protection . What kind of protection ? Strong , prohibitively strong , tariffs . Why ? The revolution in consumer electronics has been caused by declining prices in real terms by 7% to 10% year after year . It has been killing us . The European companies that are still alive were able to increase their productivity year after year by that factor . Because of that efficiency , a tariff policy would allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets very quickly . At the end of the day , it would be to the advantage of the consumer . Do you really believe that when Japanese companies have reached dominance , they will not recover through price hikes the billions of dollars they have taken from Japanese consumers and investors in order to attain that position ? This kind of protectionism must be acccompanied by strong modernizing policies . We must adapt our educational system , social system , class relationships , and management structures . But we ca n't do that while we 're losing one point of market share a year . There is a danger , of course , that even if we get the breathing space we wo n't take advantage of it . But if we do n't try , in five years all could be lost . We need five to ten years of tariffs to get out of our current downward spiral and get back on par with the Japanese . Of course , if we do this , we must say at the start we 'll dismantle the tariffs starting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariffs would lower Europe 's standard of living by making things more expensive . Why would consumers agree to such draconian measures ? What does it mean to be a happy consumer if you are permanently out of work in a declining nation ? Governments need to educate people . In France I think it would be easy . At the moment , consumers do n't blame Japan ; they blame us  --  European managers . That 's unfair . It is true that in the 1970s and 1980s , managers ' eyes were not on the basics of business : quality and labor relations . America blew it . American management became somewhat old . Europe blew it . We had it too easy . There was too much diversification and short-termism , too many financial gimmicks and fads . But those chapters are over . If we give up , we say goodbye electronics , which in a few years will be 10% of our GDP . Can you imagine if none of that industry is left in Europe ? If we are working only at Japanese-owned factories ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with that ? I think the British are wrong , completely wrong . They believe that an infusion of Japanese capital and management through transplants of factories will revitalize British industry . I do n't believe a word of it . A few thousand jobs in Wales or Scotland are not the issue . The issue is the repair of the national tissue of technological and managerial competence . There is not one example  --  not one  --  of the Japanese establishing a major R &D; lab outside Japan . To the contrary , they take technology out of other companies . They are buying our scientists and our technology and our high-tech startups . They are taking technology out of the U.S. and Europe . How many European managers are working in Japanese transplant factories ? If British industry has to be rejuvenated by a transfusion of Japanese manufacturing , it would take thousands and thousands of British managers and scientists working in Europe a la Japonaise , which wo n't happen . It 's typical European gullibility not to understand the danger . The free-traders are confusing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the revival , the saving of Western Europe was a direct consequence of the transfusion of U.S. companies ' management , technology , and expertise and the opening of U.S. universities to European scholars . I do n't believe for a second that that is what is happening now . Japanese business schools and companies are closed to Westerners . We 're creating a free-trade arena between ourselves in Europe ; that 's a good idea . But in doing that , we 've given the Japanese the best gift they could have dreamed of . We are creating what will be the biggest market in the world for them . And the irony of the situation is that they are the ones who coined the phrase Fortress Europe . What a joke ! What is the impact of European unification on foreign trade ? European countries are no longer individual nations . On the other hand , Europe  --  the new unified Europe  --  does not yet exist . This is the main problem of Europe now , not only for our industrial competitiveness but also for our immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get away from history . There never was in modern history any creation of a new nation out of separate nations without protection of markets . When Adam Smith and David Ricardo were writing around 1776 , Britain was erecting very high tariffs that lasted until 1846 . When the British attained supremacy , they forgot about those tariffs . The United States had very high tariffs from the end of the Civil War until shortly before World War I. So why not us ? We do n't need the impulse of external competition to make us run . The European market is the biggest market in the world . If it is 100% deregulated , competition between ourselves would be certainly pressing enough to constrain us to stay in shape . <p>
