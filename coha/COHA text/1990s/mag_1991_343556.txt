More than any other malignancy , cancer of the prostate has a reputation for stealth . While 122,000 American men were diagnosed with the disease last year  --  making it the leading cancer among men  --  70% of those tumors had already managed to spread beyond the gland and into the rest of the body without being detected . Frustrated surgeons have long hoped for a test that could pick up more of these cancers before they become inoperable . Now they may have got their wish . Researchers reported in last week 's New England Journal of Medicine that a new method could potentially spot 20% to 30% more cancers than do rectal exams alone , the current means of early tumor detection . <P> The simple $50 test , based on a protein called prostate-specific antigen , or PSA , will soon be offered to men over 50 who are at special risk for the disease , including blacks and those with a family history of the ailment . Some experts contend that all older men should be tested . Predicts lead author Dr. William Catalona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should dramatically alter the statistics on prostate cancer . " <P> Rectal examinations have been the standard for early diagnosis for nearly a century . But this method , in which doctors probe the prostate gland manually , has not been very popular with patients or their doctors . In West Germany , where men over 40 can be tested for free , a recent study found that only 15% actually agreed to have it done . Physicians point out that the exams often fail to detect smaller cancers and those that originate on the front of the gland . The method is also subjective . One expert remarked that all he can tell his medical students is that the gland feels " like the soft skin at the base of the thumb " while a tumor feels " like a knuckle . " Concluded Dr. William Cooner , a PSA expert at the University of South Alabama : " The rectal examination has served us very poorly . " Several alternatives have been tried over the years , the most recent being an ultrasound probe . Although this proved somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $200 to $300 an exam it is too costly to use for routine screening . <P> The basis for the new assay , PSA , is a protein produced by cells on the surface of the prostate and thought to play a role in preventing semen from coagulating . An enlarged prostate ( due to cancer or other problems ) leads to higher levels of PSA in the blood . Doctors already use PSA tests to monitor the effectiveness of prostate-cancer therapies , such as irradiation or hormonal treatments . Some researchers have argued that the exams should replace much more expensive bone scans as a way of determining how far the cancer has spread . <P> But the method is by no means foolproof . Catalona stresses that 21% of the men in his study with prostate cancer actually had " normal " PSA levels . Thus the test should be used only in combination with a rectal exam , he said , and even then some cancers will be missed .                   @ @
