<p> Kinky Friedman <p> 8:30 and 10 p.m . Thursday <p> FitzGerald 's , 6615 W. Roosevelt Rd. , Berwyn <p> Tickets , $ 15 <p> ( 312 ) 559-1212 <p> Country singer-novelist Kinky Friedman just returned from his first tour of South Africa . While there , he discovered that he 's very popular in the Nelson Mandela camp . It is a small world , after all . <p> Friedman , who lands at FitzGerald 's in Berwyn on Thursday , appeared on a Johannesburg television show with Tokyo Sexwale , considered the heir apparent to Mandela , South Africa 's president . Last year , Sexwale was elected the first black premier of the province that includes Johannesburg and Soweto . <p> " Tokyo and Mandela spent 27 years ( as political prisoners ) on Robben Island ( a penal camp ) , " Friedman said . " During the television show , the commentator told me , " You know , Tokyo is a fan of your music , and it is difficult to get in South Africa , even today . ' So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robben Island . They got a lot of bootleg tapes there . He did say , ' Dolly Parton was our very favorite . ' But I was right up there . " <p> Friedman has embarked on an extended " God Bless John Wayne " tour that celebrates his new 20-tune compilation CD " From One Good American to Another " ( Fruit of the Tune , Box 440 , Montclair , N.J. 07042 ) and his eighth mystery novel , God Bless John Wayne ( Simon &; Schuster , $ 22 ) . The Kinkster , who will be performing without his band , the Texas Jewboys , will sign books and CDs between shows Thursday . " From One Good American to Another " features unreleased versions of some of Friedman 's most politically incorrect material . <p> Friedman spent almost a month in South Africa . He made a pilgrimage to Breaker Morant 's grave and left last week with God Bless John Wayne as the No. 2 best-selling book in South Africa , behind Tom Robbins . Friedman found that fans there  --  even after years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than knee-jerk American listeners . <p> " I do n't change my show at all , " he said . " If I say ( the ' n-word ' ) in a lyric , I leave it in , no matter if I 'm in Texas , Chicago or South Africa . Black , white , Indian , in South Africa , they understood where I was coming from . In America , the South has been through similar things as South Africa . Race relations there are probably better than they are here . Because people in South Africa , of all colors , have a sense of humor . It 's out in the open . <p> " They know they 've had a very oppressive government . I was told if I had done this ( tour ) five years ago , it would have been a disaster . I would have been arrested , everyone would have hated it . As it is , they know I 've been out of step with the world and had my share of misunderstandings . South Africa has , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Whitney Houston . The country has a great wind of promise blowing through it . " <p> Just like Friedman , who turned 51 on Halloween . <p> God Bless John Wayne trails Ratso , his tried-and-true Dr. Watson character as he searches for his birth mother . Friedman has written himself into his books in the guise of a New York-based , Cuban cigar-smoking private detective . God Bless John Wayne returns Friedman to his New York City landscape , made obvious from the book 's first sentence : " It was raining cool cats and Kosher hot dogs in the city that afternoon . " <p> " I think the author has matured , " said Friedman , whose books have been translated into 10 languages . " My own mother stepped on a rainbow ( died ) 10 years ago . She grew up in Chicago and is buried here . It makes the search for Ratso 's real mother poignant . One of the joys of writing is that people appear to be getting a lot more out of my books than I 'm actually putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood , what are Jews going to think , what are country fans going to think ? I 'm writing to entertain myself . " <p> Friedman has had one close call with Hollywood . A few years back , Friedman , Bob Dylan and Dennis Hopper were ready to embark on an independent film " Cowboys Are Frequently , Secretly Fond of Each Other , " based on Friedman 's script . It wound up instead as a Friedman-Willie Nelson duet . <p> " Working with Hollywood is like trying to play piano in a whorehouse , " Friedman said . " I told people I did n't want River Phoenix to be Kinky Friedman . And River stepped on a rainbow and went to Jesus . Then we began negotiating with John Candy to play Ratso , because he was a big Kinky fan . And then he stepped on a rainbow and went to Jesus . Then I pulled the whole project off the burner . " <p> Good idea . <p> Friedman has finished his next novel , The Love Song of J. Edgar Hoover , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his friend . In it , mysterious murders occur on Nelson 's endless tours . <p> " It 's tentatively called Road Kill , " Friedman chuckled . " Willie always says the trick is not to slash your wrists before you hit the next town . He 's like all of us in music , an applause junkie . You can do a great show in Cape Town and move on to Johannesburg the next night . But with a book , it 's not true . It 's one of the longest , surviving structures a man can build . " ENT08.0AI$ TEMP$ PAPER:CHICAGO SUN-TIMES <p> Earlier this fall while visiting friends in upstate New York , I went to a local farmers market one Friday morning . I was in paradise , my eyes widening as I looked at the delicious array of fruits and vegetables . <p> A stand at which homemade pies were being sold immediately caught my attention . Each dessert looked sublime , but one in particular , a caramel apple pie , seemed irresistible . I wanted to buy it for dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already planned , including dessert . <p> Back in Massachusetts the next week , I kept thinking about that pie and how it must have been made . Finally , last weekend I invited a small group to our house for a casual fall supper and set out to re-create the Adirondack apple pie . <p> I used a favorite recipe , and after the pie was baked , I drizzled it with good store-bought caramel sauce and sprinkled it with chopped pecans . I served the pie warm . <p> Luckily , my first attempt was successful , for everyone asked for seconds  --  and for the recipe . <p> Before this quintessential autumn dessert , we enjoyed orange-scented pork tenderloins , buttered noodles , baked acorn squash and some fresh sugar-snap peas . <p> Though the pie makes a memorable dinner finale , it 's good enough to stand on its own . <p> Inviting friends for apple pie and coffee after a bike ride , a football game or even after the movies would be an easy way to entertain and a good excuse to enjoy one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Makes 6 to 8 servings <p> Crust : <p> 1 cup flour <p> 1/4 teaspoon salt <p> 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar <p> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter , chilled and cut into small chunks <p> 2 tablespoons shortening , chilled and cut into small chunks <p> 2 1/2 tablespoons ice water <p> Filling : <p> 5 to 5 1/2 cups of 1/4-inch-thick slices peeled and cored Granny Smith apples <p> 1 cup sugar <p> 1 tablespoon flour <p> 1/4 teaspoon salt <p> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon <p> 1 teaspoon lemon juice <p> 2 tablespoons diced unsalted butter <p> 6 tablespoons purchased caramel sauce <p> 2/3 cup chopped pecans <p> 1 .

Although he officially retired at the end of 2007 , he still needs and wants to work . Since then , he has sent out about 150 rsums and met with half a dozen employers . But so far , none of the interviews -- many conducted by managers who appear much younger than Palmer -- have panned out . " You 're always at a disadvantage when the economy is not in good shape , because then it becomes a buyer 's market , " he says . Palmer is one of 1.6 million unemployed Americans ages 55 and older . Although this group is still more likely to be employed than the overall population ( which has an 8.1 percent jobless rate ) , the unemployment rate for those age 55 and older jumped from 3.2 percent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Department . The uptick is partly due to more people seeking work during the traditional retirement years , according to Richard Johnson , an Urban Institute researcher . " It 's now tougher for people to maintain their preretirement lifestyles without working , " he says . It 's possible to re-enter the workforce after 50 . But you might need to spruce up your rsum for today 's changing job market or even consider a new field . Here are strategies older workers can use to move their rsum to the top of the stack , score an interview , and land a new job : Play down your age . Age often brings wisdom , but wisdom can seem awfully expensive to a hiring manager . You do n't have to list every achievement . " You should consider not putting dates like graduation dates on your rsum , " says Tom Musbach , senior managing editor of Yahoo HotJobs . " You do n't want to lie if asked , but on your rsum , you do n't want to broadcast that you graduated in 1960 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a career coaching and networking firm , 65 percent of senior-level executives age 40 or older say they downplay their age on their rsums . Older workers must appear up-to-date with the modern workforce , so be sure to list work experience most relevant to the job for which you 're applying . That way , your rsum will turn up in job-bank searches . Some retirees are turning their age into an advantage . Rosemary Facchini , 62 , a retired English teacher and nurse in Chadwicks , N.Y. , was updating her will when her lawyer commented on her impressive system of organizing papers and suggested that she market the idea to other seniors . Now she runs a small business , Two Red Kitties , that sells personal-document organizers , primarily to baby boomers and retirees . Use examples . Do n't just say you have good communication skills ; give concrete examples of how your abilities boosted a former employer 's bottom line . " If you 're applying for a financial position , you can find out what system of accounting the company uses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last three jobs , " says Steven Greenberg , CEO and founder of Jobs4Point0.com , a job-search website for those 40 and older . It helps if you can quantify how much money your skills made or saved the company . You might be expected to show as well as tell . " In a sales or marketing-related position , your follow-up has to be excellent because that 's part of the job and you 're showing me what kind of salesperson you are , " Greenberg says . Emphasize your flexibility . A common misconception is that older workers are unfamiliar with new technologies and resistant to change . " You have to demonstrate your flexibility and adaptability and comfort with technology , " says Mark Anderson , president of ExecuNet , a networking firm for senior-level executives . So play up any computer experience you have : Include a link on your rsum to a website you designed , or describe a program you implemented that improved work flow . Offer new info . Most people know that following up is the best way to make sure your rsum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone without a plan . Offer new information about yourself that applies to the job and is n't included in your rsum or cover letter . " You want to call out something to your experience each time you follow up , " says Greenberg . " You 're creating more data points for the employer to have about you and make a decision about you . " Be a problem solver . Companies are looking for employees who can help them stay competitive . " Finding out what problems a company may have and then positioning yourself as a solution to that problem is a really important way to set yourself apart from a person who comes to the interview and just answers questions , " Anderson says . " You have to demonstrate what you can do that is better than what others can do . " Try to appear optimistic , even if your job search has you feeling bleak . Apply to companies that are n't hiring . Many positions are never publicly posted . " With so many people seemingly out of work , employers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates that they have to weed through to find the jewels , " says Rene Ward , founder and publisher of Seniors4Hire.org . " The recruiter will network and/or search rsum databases to select candidates . " Try sending your rsum to companies that do n't have open positions listed on their websites . Tell acquaintances about your job hunt . Let your network of friends and colleagues know you 're looking for a new job . " The way you are going to find your next opportunity is through a network of people who know what you can do , " says Anderson . After Arlene Carter , 59 , of Seattle was laid off from a real estate and property-management company five years ago at age 53 , she tried responding to job advertisements , but none of those worked out . She eventually found out about her current gig as a fundraiser and public-relations representative for a nonprofit while chatting with other parents at a parade . " My granddaughter and my current boss 's daughter were on a float together , and she said , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " Carter says . Focus on fields that welcome older workers . After age 50 , you probably do n't want a strenuous job that requires standing or repetitive motion all day . There are plenty of industries that welcome older workers , such as healthcare , education , and the government . ( These fields are also proving to be relatively recession resistant . ) Pat Egan Dexter , 77 , of Mesa , Ariz. , knew that her current position tutoring kindergarten students for Experience Corps would be senior-friendly when she saw an ad for the job in a senior center newsletter . You might also want to consider consulting and part-time work that could lead to a full-time position . At the very least , these jobs could put you in touch with people who may have jobs to offer . Cultivating new skills or going back to school can also help . After retiring from a job as a high school guidance counselor , Robert Ward , 68 , of Lewes , Del. , went back to nursing school and now works as an on-call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class at the local hospital . " Look into something you believe you would like to do , and train for it , " he says . " And make sure before you even enter the trade that there is a need . The health profession is not going anywhere . People are going to continue to get sick , and people are going to pay for it one way or another . " Of course , the most important tip is to not give up , even though the current job environment makes that a pretty tempting option . And if you do n't find a job right now , these tips will put you in a better position to succeed when the economy does recover and companies look for experienced workers to help them grow .
