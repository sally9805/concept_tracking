<p> KRENIE Stowe 's medical practice is housed in an ordinary-looking strip center across the street from Tomball Regional Hospital . In a waiting room bustling with babies and women speaking Spanish , a big sign asks , " " Are you interested in Depo-Provera ? Tubal ligation ? Birth control pills ? " <p> A young woman holding a cherubic-looking baby stands in a hallway and smiles shyly at a passerby . She 's here to get care for her son , but also the free birth control pills she could ill afford otherwise , pills that will help her avoid another teen-age pregnancy and all the troubles that go along with it . <p> Another doctor with Stowe 's credentials might seek to do something more illustrious than dispensing birth control to poor women or bestowing low-cost immunizations on their young . <p> She 's a doctor with a medical degree from Albert Einstein College of Medicine . She 's a lawyer who graduated " " magna cum laude " from Harvard Law School . She holds a bachelor 's degree in literature from Yale University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andover Academy . Stowe could be pulling down the big bucks , living the kind of rarefied life often conferred upon the nation 's best and brightest . <p> Instead , she 's put out her doctor shingle in Tomball and welcomed folks not accustomed to finding open arms in waiting rooms - the destitute , the undocumented , the Medicaid-dependent . Not surprisingly , in little more than one year , Stowe 's pediatric and adolescent medicine practice has swelled to around 2,000 patients , most of whom live in the surrounding rural counties . <p> But office care for indigent youngsters is only part of the plan . Krenie and her mother , Maria Frontis Stowe , also a physician , last spring created a nonprofit agency they believe could revolutionize community health care in this country . <p> It 's called the Frontis Project , named after Krenie 's grandfather , Constantine Frontis , a Greek immigrant and physician who practiced medicine in Beaumont in the ' 40s . In addition to medical services , with a heavy emphasis on family planning , the Frontis Project encompasses everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support services that help patients navigate the Medicaid maze or simply get to appointments on time . <p> It 's all part of a holistic approach that says how well people do in their health care relates to how well they do in their lives . And vice versa . <p> " " We talk about access to care , but it 's not as simple as just sticking a clinic on a corner or setting up a new bus route , " says Krenie . " " It 's much more integral and deep than that . It 's about how people who are depressed or angry or victimized have trouble getting things for themselves . " <p> Her law school work focused on issues like patient rights ; her social philosophies have been honed ( among other places ) in a Harlem ghetto , at a big-city neonatal intensive care ward and on an Indian reservation . <p> Reinventing the American health-care system may sound like a tall order , until you spend time with Krenie , an unrepentant iconoclast who has spent the better part of 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a method she apparently learned from Maria , her equally iconoclastic mother , who learned it from her father , Constantine . <p> Listening to their life story is like reading a textbook chapter on idealism , of the real-world variety . <p> Maria Stowe is a grandmotherly woman with a lilting voice and warm smile , whose attire hints at the exotic : an upswooped Grecian bun , bright pink lipstick , black tights , chunky silver jewelry . She ushers a visitor around the office , past shelves of give-away infant formula , past a spacious playroom filled with donated toys , past a table loaded with fruit . Many of their young patients " " live on rice and beans and thus have major dietary problems , " says Maria . <p> Like her daughter , she speaks fluent Spanish , from the years when she ran a family health clinic in Juarez , Mexico . It was there she treated women sick and dying from septic abortions , women who were on their fifth or 10th or 20th pregnancies , women whose babies were born with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make international headlines . <p> Though she is a doctor , Maria is the backbone of everything in the Frontis Project that is nonmedical in nature . She oversees Mujeres Unidas , a microenterprising group of local , poor Hispanic women who sell imported goods on consignment at a local shopping center , bake and sell tamales , and clean houses . <p> Maria is the one who shows the new mother how to find her way to the WIC office ; she 's the one who makes sure the 16-year-old mother whose baby has a heart murmur wakes up in time to get to a morning referral at Texas Childrens ' Hospital . She speaks briefly with a young Hispanic woman who is sorting through donated clothes in a hallway . Then she shows off a shelf of free vaccines she finagled from the state . Much of her time , she says , is spent on the telephone , cutting through bureaucratic red tape . She 's good at it . <p> " " We do a huge number of immunizations , " says Maria , in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , has just " " horrendous " immunization statistics , some of the worst . " <p> She leads past a small examining office where Krenie is speaking to a patient while simultaneously breast-feeding her 3-month-old son , Isaac . Krenie is Greek-American ; her husband , John Taylor , is African-American and a full-time college student who plans to attend law school . Krenie likes to tell the story of how , right before she moved to Tomball , she asked a local health care professional about the extent of the town 's African-American community . <p> " " He told me , ' Oh , they have that problem over in Waller ( county ) . ' I thought to myself , ' Well , you have that problem here now ! ' " she says , laughing heartily . <p> Krenie has brought Isaac to work with her almost since he was born ; he has his own room , complete with a bed and stuffed toys , plus the loving attention of the women who work there - Maria , who dotes shamelessly on him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Virginia , a friend who helps out . Moving unseen through the office is the spirit of Constantine Frontis , a man whom Krenie never met but who had an enormous influence on her life , she says . <p> " " Mother told me stories about him every day , " she says , settling into a chair after the last patient has left . She is as commonsensical and pragmatic as her mother is lilting and nurturing ; the two talk to each other like old friends instead of mother and daughter . <p> " " Krenie is very much like him , " says Maria as she gently rocks Isaac , now asleep on her shoulder . " " They 're connected in spirit . They 're both very nonjudgmental . " <p> Maria , who tends to answer questions by telling stories , tells a few about Constantine . He left Greece as a young man , fed up with the fascist regime headed by his brother Athanasios Frondistis , brigadier general of the Greek army and close friend to the king . He came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't considered proper to treat patients with certain skin colors . He treated them anyway . He treated them even if they could n't pay , or if all they could pay was a batch of okra or a pair of shoes . <p> Maria 's father was gone much of the time , making his rounds to the rice fields of Beaumont , to the decrepit shantytowns that housed the town 's poor blacks . Sometimes he would take his young daughter along with him , trips that left her with lasting images of poverty and segregation . <p> Constantine died at age 40 , when Maria was 12 . <p> At 19 , she married a " " wild , spoiled rich kid " and moved to an exclusive enclave in Connecticut . By the time Krenie was 6 , Maria had had enough of the pampered life . <p> " " I decided I was never going to have my child grow up in a segregated place , " she says . <p> When Maria left her husband , she and Krenie moved to Manhattan where Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , working with teen-age heroin addicts . Like her father , she would often take her young daughter along on rounds . In the Harlem housing projects , Krenie saw firsthand the problems wrought by poverty , drug addiction and de facto segregation . <p> " " My interest in teen pregnancy prevention , especially , came from those years , " says Krenie . " " It was very clear to me even as a youngster that it was a big , big , big piece of the problem . " <p> Maria worked three jobs to keep them afloat and enrolled Krenie in the Manhattan Country School , a progressive private school that was one of the first in the nation to strive for racial balance . Children from upper-crust New York families sat next to children from the ghetto . <p> While she was doing social work , Maria got the idea for a mobile unit that would go into inner-city areas and dispense desperately needed health care . She and Krenie stayed up all night designing a prototype . Her idea was rejected . Angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Universidad Autonomo de Guadalahara . In Mexico , Krenie attended an international high school , where she frequently got embroiled in philosophical arguments with teachers and was eventually kicked out . <p> She left Mexico and was admitted to the prestigious Phillips Andover Academy on scholarships , loans and grants , which is how she funded all her education , she says . After graduation she attended Yale , during which time she did crisis pregnancy intervention for the Women 's Health Service in Connecticut . <p> Medical school always had been her goal , but she did n't perform well on standardized tests , despite having excellent grades , she says . She applied to 35 different medical schools , none of which asked for a follow-up interview - except for Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Harvard Medical School . At the latter , she says , the admissions person skeptically eyed her resume , with its listing of her volunteer work at Mexican clinics and her pregnancy , contraception and abortion counseling . <p> " " She looked at me and said , ' My , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever done anything that 's not medically related ? Ever been a member of the glee club or something ? Do you like to cook ? ' " Krenie laughs uproariously . <p> Krenie was admitted into Albert Einstein , where she says she found a relentless focus on science , memorization and " " the whole doctor-as-god " mentality - an experience that shaped her determination to approach healing differently . <p> With a specialty in pediatrics , she did her first year of residency at New York 's Bellevue Hospital , a sprawling , inner-city teaching hospital . A portion of her residency was spent in the neonatal intensive care unit , where the majority of her patients were premature babies born to drug-addicted mothers . Krenie watched in anger as millions of dollars were spent trying to keep these babies alive , a futile quest since most were also infected with the HIV virus , either through their drug-using mothers or through multiple blood transfusions . ( This was in 1985 , right as blood began to be screened rigorously , she says . ) " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ward , " she says . <p> Disillusioned , she left her residency after one year - not a prudent decision , she admits , looking back - and enrolled in law school . This time , Harvard embraced her . And Krenie , it seems , had found her milieu : A self-proclaimed " " leftist , " she reveled in passionate discussions with equally left-leaning professors . Even the sexism she encountered at Harvard , a particularly harsh strain that she says made medical school look like a walk in the park , had its bright side . <p> " " It did wonders for my development as a feminist , " she says . <p> " " It 's such an interesting experience to be hated , hated by such a large number of people . It did a lot for me . " <p> She did clerkships for the American Civil Liberties Union , the National Abortion Rights Action League , the AIDS Law Clinic and the National Health Law Program in Washington , D.C. But the lure of the front lines was too strong : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no kids , no folks . " So Krenie went back and finished her medical residency , this time at a primary-care community clinic . <p> While Krenie pursued her different degrees , Maria completed medical school , did one year of post-graduate work at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York , then returned to Mexico to work in the clinic . In 1988 she and Krenie both attended the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston for one year but withdrew over dissatisfaction with the curriculum . Maria returned to Mexico to work in a rural clinic but left when she ran afoul of political types who did not approve of her efforts to promote reproductive freedom among the indigenous women , she says . Since returning to the United States , she has worked primarily as a psychotherapist . <p> For t he most part , the two women share an intensely intertwined history : Where Maria has gone , Krenie has gone ; where Krenie has gone , Maria has gone . This includes the time after Krenie completed her public clinic residency , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota . <p> " " Most of the choices I make about work have to do with ideas I have that are theoretical that I want to check , " says Krenie . <p> The idea she wanted to explore in North Dakota was : How are health problems of the rural poor different from those of the urban poor ? <p> Not by much , she discovered . On the reservation , where 3,500 people from three tribes were squeezed into tenement-style housing plunked down on vast tracts of land , Krenie found the same ailments she saw in the ghetto : rampant alcoholism , diabetes , hypertension , heart disease , heavy tobacco use , domestic violence , child abuse , massive school dropout rates , teen pregnancy . <p> " " There would have been crack-cocaine abuse except it was n't around , " she says flatly . <p> But she made things better , she says . By focusing on prevention - she and Maria established birth control programs for teens , a boys ' hockey team , immunization programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she left in 1994 . <p> By then she was married to John , a drug and alcohol abuse counselor in the Air Force who 'd gotten stationed in North Dakota . ( They dated as teens , then met again in 1982 and married in 1991 . ) They wanted to move some place warmer , some place were they could peaceably raise a mixed-race child , some place with a poor , rural population where Krenie could put her theories of proactive health care into practice . <p> When Tomball Regional Hospital came calling , she was primed . <p> Krenie explains that there 's a tremendous shortage these days in primary-care doctors - that is , those who have n't specialized in high-paying fields like neurology or cardiology . Especially in the Tomball area , she says , there was a real need for pediatric care . <p> She put her name on a list of doctors willing to be recruited , and that 's how the Tomball hospital found her . They set her up with an office , which helped : Krenie says she owes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd wanted to open a community health clinic and have the hospital pay her to run it , but they wanted a " " private sector doctor " instead , she says . <p> Krenie says her relations with the hospital are cordial , mainly because " " I 'm a really good doctor . " <p> Karen Frye , director of marketing and physician recruitment for the hospital , agrees . <p> " " We 're fortunate to have a physician like Dr.Stowe , who is professional , compassionate and provides high-quality care , " she says . " " We 're a community-based hospital , and we continue to seek out physicians of her caliber , who realize our vision of improving and providing for the community . " Not all Krenie 's patients are on Medicaid or uninsured - the ratio is about 60 percent Medicaid , 40 percent self-paying or insured - but mixing middle-class and poor patients in the same waiting room is core to her philosophy . Even those who ca n't pay much pay something , she says ; few pay nothing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private sector and was " " astonished " to find that doctors routinely turn away patients on Medicaid , that it 's perfectly legal to do that . <p> " " I learned quick and hard just how much ( the American health-care system ) is like JCPenney , like Sears . If you do n't have the money up front , if you do n't have insurance , you do n't get seen . There are exceptions among some doctors , of course , but the vast majority are that way . The vast majority use collection agencies and the whole nine yards . I was amazed . " <p> She says most doctors in her area limit their Medicaid patients to 10 percent to 20 percent of their practice ; the only other pediatrician in Tomball does n't accept them at all . <p> Most area obstetricians also are n't accepting new Medicaid patients , she says , which means many poor women in labor ( who 've had no prenatal care ) end up in the hospital 's emergency room . Krenie performs Pap smears for mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them birth control pills , because they ca n't find that service elsewhere . <p> Krenie finds many things wrong with the current health-care system , not the least of which is the way caregivers routinely ignore their unique window into patients ' lives . As healers of the body , says Krenie , they 're trusted . They can ask questions and get answers . But so often , they do n't ask . Krenie talks about something she calls " " social triage , " an idea central to the Frontis Project . <p> In emergency rooms , nurses practice something called medical triage , which means they make minute-by-minute decisions on who gets care next based on medical needs . In Krenie Stowe 's version , health workers adjust their approach given the specific social needs of the patient . Who will not give her child medicine because she ca n't afford the prescription ? Who might not come to the next appointment because she 's a victim of spouse abuse ? Who 'll do fine with just basic instructions ? Who needs to be led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking questions and then acting on the information . <p> " " One reason ( health-care ) compliance so often fails is because there 's no tailoring , " says Krenie . " " Caregivers use the same sort of schtick basically with everyone who walks in the door . <p> Even if the schtick is pretty good , it 's not going to work for a lot of people . " Some would say where a patient lives , or who with , is none of the doctor 's concern . Illiteracy , teen pregnancy , drug abuse , poverty - these are social problems , not medical ones . Krenie says if you do n't get involved , you 're not living up to your responsibility as a physician . <p> Still in its infancy , the Frontis Project so far has operated under the auspices of her private practice , using her own money . Now the mother-daughter team is formally seeking funding for yet another part of their dream : a mobile unit that would take medical care directly into the rural community . This service is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are underserved , forcing poor residents to drive for miles and miles for basic medical care , or to forgo such care at all . <p> The project , which theoretically is separate from her practice ( she wanted to fold her office doors and just " " become " the nonprofit organization , but was advised against it ) accepts clothes , food and volunteers from the community . So far , the people of Tomball have responded energetically to the project , says Maria . <p> What Krenie could really use now ( besides $ 167,000 for the mobile unit ) is a crackerjack grant writer , she says . She envisions the day when the Frontis Project is duplicated throughout the nation , with health-care givers attacking social ills at their source . <p> " " These sorts of problems ca n't be changed by conglomerates , by huge entities " she says . " " But they can be changed over time , day-to-day , with relationships . "
