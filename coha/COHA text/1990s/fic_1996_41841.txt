In 1969 , except for the yearly wardrobe changes of the young officers ' wives , Randolph Air Force Base had barely acknowledged the decade . The young officers discussed shoeshines , the laundry that put the sharpest crease in their everyday khakis , which colonel gave the best TDY . Friday afternoons the wives met them at the Officers Club . The best wives ordered pink drinks and said little . Others drank beer or bourbon and seven , swiveled on their bar stools , and looked toward the door . <p> None of the young officers talked about the war on base . They had made their choices : Air Force ROTC or Officer Candidate School , emphasis ground duty , stateside . Some felt smug and safely patriotic about their decision . Some regretted it , felt that anything , even a tour of duty in Nam , would be better than reporting every day to the Education and Training Division , three years of Orwellian routine , a complex of duties so particular and minute that only a few realized there was nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their promotions , striving for the recognition of Colonel Teale and Colonel Dunne . <p> Here is a second lieutenant from Grand Island , Nebraska , a town that was neither grand nor on or near an island . If he had a metaphorical turn of mind , he might draw some parallels . He has a master 's degree in elementary education and a wife , but has run out of military deferments and has made his choice . He says it 's the right thing . No one asks if he believes it . <p> He bought his wife the Air Force Officers ' Wives Handbook , and half hoped she would n't get a job when they moved south so late in the summer , but the Eli Whitney High School needed a teacher to take over its accelerated program and her credentials were good . He went with her to the job interview , but no one asked her age so he could n't accuse her of lying . The first weeks of the term she 'd come home late , crying , and he said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to monitor her classes . After a few months , he did n't hear any more about the twentyyear-old senior and part-time bull rider who came to her class drunk or the student ROTC hall guard who demanded her hall pass , but she still came home late , every night . <p> He asked his parents for the down payment for a house just offbase . His next-door neighbor was a staff sergeant who encouraged the young second looey and his wife to poison the clover that swept the front lawn and to set in pale squares of greenhouse grass . " Those poor devils who lived here before , " the sergeant kept saying , " they did n't know shit about grass , poor devils " <p> Colonel Teale and Colonel Dunne liked to tease the new second lieutenant 's wife because she looked cute when she argued with them about Easy Rider or the naked teenagers in Romeo and Juliet . At school , one of her students gave a report on Kent State and another was called down to the office because in a class discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second lieutenant 's wife was called down to the office , too , but it was for skirt length . The vice principal requested that she wear a longer skirt to Parents ' Night . She asked if a pants suit would be all right , but he started tapping the black book she 'd heard about in the Communist incident so she said yes , of course . Later , she would describe this as an ignominious epiphany : for want of a below-the-knee dress , a good little girl was lost . <p> Some of the young officers had almost completed their three years . They had parties where people wandered around with glow-in-the-dark flowers and symbols painted on their faces . Even enlisted men came to these parties . One of them drove a white van with a big yellow peace sign emblazoned on the side . The young second lieutenant was n't so comfortable at these gatherings , although he painted FUCK on his forehead with lime-green Day-Glo and thought it was pretty funny because he forgot about it when he went on a beer run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . She was sitting in a corner with a guy everyone called Dopey who 'd received a dishonorable discharge for mental incompetence . It was time to get his wife out of there so he pulled on her hand . Even though he always teased her about her weight , there was n't very much to her , never had been , and he was surprised to feel the strength of her resistance , surprised to hear the power in her scream . After that , everything moved in slow motion , the way cinematographers were starting to film riots , protests , police brutality . He felt her go limp beneath him , as if she 'd been trained . He saw people rush to her , heard the man with the yellow peace sign say she could stay in his van . Someone slipped her what looked like a business card . <p> The young second lieutenant made love to his wife that night . He said everything had evened out . She had hurt him , and he had hurt her . <p> When the second lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her parents , blaming liberal friends and how they put ideas in an innocent girl 's head . Her mother saved that letter twenty years before showing it to her daughter . " You should have it , " she said . " I did n't want you to throw it away . I think you can use it . " <p>
