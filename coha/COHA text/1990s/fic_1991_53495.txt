THEY 'RE SITTING at breakfast . Well , Jack 's sitting . Goody 's standing over the griddle flipping pancakes in Jack 's direction when Jack lifts his head out of the book he 's reading and asks if there 's any more orange juice . Goody 's thinking about the comedienne she watched on TV last night . " Ever notice that domestic appliances all sound angry ? " the comedienne had said . " Vacuum cleaners , garbage disposals , electric mixers  --  they sound all mouth . " The audience laughed . Jack laughed in the bed beside her . " Argumentative . Put out . A little insane if you want to know the truth , " the comedienne had said . " I can see why they make babies cry . I can see being afraid of some of them myself  --  the way they slosh and suck and grind things up indiscriminately . I can see begging out of housework because of fear . " Then the comedienne had brought a little rat terrier on stage and announced that the dog was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ripped the Electrolux to smithereens . It dragged the vacuum cleaner all over the stage and disemboweled it . <p> Anyway , Goody hears the assault-and-battery sound of clothes banging around in the dryer at the exact instant Jack inquires about more orange juice , and you might say she 's temporarily inspired . She thinks of hissing at him : " Ssssserve yourssssself , Jack " - sort of like a steam iron . But she does n't . She refills his little orange juice glass with a pert twist of her wrist . Nothing to it , really . She enjoys being queen of the kitchen . <p> Out the kitchen window the sun spins over the trees like a bright wheel of good fortune . " It 's a nice day out , " Goody says . " Maybe we ought to till up the garden ? Maybe we ought to set out the seedlings ? " <p> " We ? " Jack says . " Whoa there just a minute , " Jack says , laying down his book . " I dreamed I went to Siberia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to his flush-faced reading . He 's the readingest man she 's ever known . When his face goes into a book it stays there with this naughty inflamed look like he 's gazing up somebody 's dress . He reads like a blind man , touching the pages , line by line , with one slow finger . He shapes the words silently with his lips in such an earnest schoolboy way that Goody will begin to make excuses for him the longer she watches . <p> Through the glass porthole of the clothes dryer she sees his Levi 's tumbling around her dainty things , the hot metal zipper snagging the lace in a kind of hard-core ballet . In the ripply old toaster she sees herself looking merely astonished that it all comes down to this : Jack and her so unremorsefully who they are . Why does n't anybody look sad ? <p> " We 're going to Pain and Ollie 's tonight , " she tells Jack . " I told Pam I 'd bring a pie . " <p> " A pie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " So I 'll need you to move , " she says . " I 'll need to roll it out on the table . " <p> " Well , " Jack says , smushing out a cigarette . " Pam and Ollie 's is it ? I sure do like Pam 's jokes . ' How do you make Swiss bread ? ' ' You use your basic dill-dough . ' " <p> " That Pam , " Goody says , shaking her head . <p> " You said it , " Jack says , laughing . <p> She looks past him out the window where the dog is tied to a tree . He 's just lying there , hungry and lonesome and chewing on a raggedy flip-flop . God knows why he does n't bark . She 'd bark . <p> She feels moved to lay a hand on Jack 's shoulder . " Are we going to be friendly today , Jack ? " He grins up at her and shrugs . " We could risk it . " <p> " It 's all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole truth , is it ? She wants the friendliness to mean something : laid out plain between them like a little heart-shaped welcome mat that they can wipe their feet on before they enter the Dreamhouse . In the Dreamhouse Jack will read her like a book , his fingers sliding over her love-story skin . And he will want to mow the grass , want to till the garden . He will whistle while he works . " At your service , ma'am , " he 'll say , kissing her on the cheek . <p> A cloud passes over the glittering sun , and the kitchen darkens so distinctly that Goody feels uneasy , as if a sign has been given that the wrong wish was granted . But it 's just a feeling , and now it 's gone . <p> " Sure , we can be friendly , " Jack says , tilting backwards in his chair with an air of largesse . " It 's Saturday , after all  --  treat day . So sign my treaty . " Then he smacks his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to me , and you 're going to think I 'm a genius , " he says . He grabs her hands and pulls her into his lap . <p> " I need to roll out that piecrust , Jack . " <p> " Woman 's work is never done , and I 'll tell you something  --  it makes me damn nervous . Just sit a minute . You 're in for a shock . " <p> She sits a minute , perched on his knees , but it 's as if she expects a prank , that at any second his knees will fly apart and drop her through the trapdoor space between them . " How about letting me make that pie ? " Jack says . <p> Jack 's a big man , and friendliness makes him look even bigger . Suddenly he 's taking up the whole kitchen , spreading in his chair : a brawny , smoky , cast-iron stove of a man . " You just relax a while , " he says , lifting her gently off his lap . " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , collect $200 , and go spend it all in one place . " <p> " Is this a joke ? " Goody asks . <p> " Take you a bubble bath . Flip on the tube . Do n't forget it 's Saturday-there 's cartoons . " <p> " Jack ? " Goody says , but she does n't know what she means . <p> " All I need is the recipe , " Jack says . " Just write it down for me , then go your merry way . Go out shopping and have yourself a time . Buy something nice for the house  --  a chain saw maybe . " <p> " Oh , " she says . " I get it now . I was waiting for the joke to be on me . " <p> " What joke ? " Jack says . " Now get me the recipe . " <p> " You mean you seriously want to make a pie ? " <p> " Yup , " Jack says . " I think a serious cherry pie , but I could go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling out the crust , I 'll think seriously about it . " <p> " But you 've never made a piecrust in your life ! " Goody cries . <p> " So where 's the ingredients ? Where 's the pans ? Point me in the direction of that machine you call a stove . " <p> " No , " Goody says . She lays a hand on his hambone arm and she almost says , " You 'll fail , " but she does n't . <p> " I can read , ca n't I ? " Jack bellows . " You write it all down and I 'll read the directions . Big damn deal ! Some mystery ! " <p> " There 's more of a mystery than you know , " Goody tells him . " I 've been making piecrusts for twenty years , and I still hold my breath , praying each one will turn out right . This is a pie we 're taking out somewhere . It 's got to look good . It 's got to be on its best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , and salutes . <p> " You do n't understand a thing about it , Jack . There 's so much stuff to remember , lots of things you do by feel . Something could go real wrong , Jack . " <p> " Is it dangerous ? " he says . " Could I get hurt ? Does seem like I read of a man once who was making a pie , fell in , and never came out . " <p> Goody sighs . " The thing is , Jack , that you do n't start out learning how to make a pie . You learn how to boil an egg first ! " <p> Jack opens a drawer , snaps out a fresh apron , ties it on , his big red fingers looping the strings into tidy symmetrical bows . <p> " It 's sweet , your wanting to help , " she cajoles , " but you ought to watch me make a demo-model first . I 'm not trying to sound like a snob , Jack , but pie making 's a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , catches it , twirls it with a scribbling flourish . " Pie-casso ! " he says . <p> When the telephone rings , he snaps it right up . " May you speak to the lady of the house ? " he says , test-driving a rolling pin between his palms . " She 's gone out . Can I take your message ? I 'll bet you 're selling something . Encyclopedias ? Well , I do n't know when she 'll be back . She may be gone for good . Nobody knows why she left , or where she went , or what could have ever pleased her . Maybe she wanted encyclopedias , and you 're just too late . " <p> He hangs up the phone , turns on the tap , and washes his hands with Comet . <p> Jack may not be the real Jack anymore : that 's what Goody 's thinking . Yesterday at Food Lion she saw this tabloid headline : I WATCHED ALIENS CLEAN MY KITCHEN . <p> " So hurry up , " he says to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She sits at the kitchen table and writes on a paper bag . But how can she describe the thickness the dough should be when you 've finished rolling ? Or the trick with waxed paper for flipping the dough into its dish  --  all those littlest details that make every difference ? Do n't use whole tablespoons of chilled water ; be scant . Roll the dough out quick so that it does n't get tired . If it gets tired it will fall apart , just like everything else . <p> Goody hands him the paper bag , and he reads it word for word . He 's not going to make this pie , no sir , he 's going to solve it . " Just call me Pie-instein , " Jack says . <p> The phone rings again , and it 's Gypsy , her best girlfriend . Children are whooping in the background of Gypsy 's tumbling house , dogs are barking , the TV 's on too loud . Gypsy 's not a modern girl  --  she still rolls her hair up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Goody pictures her sitting on the divan in that cornball T-shirt Hank brought her from the dairy that says GET HIGH ON MILK  --  OUR COWS ARE <p> ON GRASS . She 's probably sitting on the divan , wearing her crown of orange juice cans because she and Hank are going out tonight , and she 's saving her hairdo until then , like a costume . <p> Gypsy 's calling on her ironing break . She 's got the ironing board set up in front of the television so that she can watch the Smurfs with her kids . Gypsy loves to iron . She calls ironing her therapy . She 's been corresponding with a woman she saw on a talk show who compared ironing to the joys of sex and got booed . Once she read Goody a letter the woman had sent her . It was all about ironing a man 's shirt  --  the sort of letter you keep reading over and over to see if there 's more than meets the eye , more than an attack on permanent press  --  but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gypsy asks . She feels responsible for the dog . She talked Goody into taking the dog after Goody lost the baby . <p> " I 'll be honest , " Goody says . " The dog depresses me . " <p> " He 's such a friendly dog , " Gypsy says . " I 've never seen a dog so eager to please . Maybe you 're just not a dog person . " <p> Goody wants to say that it 's the dog 's friendliness that depresses her the most . Pat him , kick him  --  it 's all the same to the dog . He 'll sit all day tied up to his tree , just grinning . Wo n't whine , wo n't bark . <p> " You get out of a dog what you put into a dog , " Gypsy says . " Is he eating good ? " <p> " Eats anything , " Goody tells her . " That 's not the problem . He 's no trouble , if that 's what you 're getting at . Eats salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him stuff from the trash can and he wo n't bat an eye . I 've seen him go for coffee grounds and cigarette butts , wagging his dumb-ass tail . He 'll wolf it all down . When he 's finished , if the pan 's the aluminum foil kind , he 'll eat the pan , too . He likes metal . He ate a screen door once . He ate the knobs off our gas grill . " <p> " I 'll tell you what 's wrong with you , " Gypsy says . " You need to get pregnant again . " <p> When Goody hangs up , she ca n't relax , she ca n't take a ride on the Reading . She wanders upstairs and turns on the shower . She could take a long bath with her bath oil beads , stretch out , soak and daydream like a girl , but she does n't . She steps into the streaming water and tilts her face into the spray . A shower makes her feel busier than a bath . She thinks : Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be ; Zippety-Doo-Dah ; Do n't B-fiat  --  B-natural . She thinks maybe she ought to dig out her camera and snap a picture of Jack working that pie . But what would it prove ? She bets herself that Jack would blur like UFO 's always do in photographs . <p> What does Jack mean by this pie ? To make a pie is one thing . To mean a pie is another . Is this a meant pie , Jack ? Or a mean one ? <p> Lord knows they 've had enough trouble lately : Jack 's layoff , losing the baby , then Jack and his first wife 's boy , Rodney , getting busted last year for selling cocaine . Once a month Goody drives up to Virginia to visit Rodney , but Jack wo n't go . Jack wo n't write Rodney letters either . Wo n't read the letters Rodney writes . <p> Goody takes Rodney the things he asks for in his letters : fancy French cigarettes she can never remember by name , gourmet candy bars , Rolling Stone magazine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view of the Blue Ridge mountains . Some days when the sun 's out and the mountains are shining , Goody thinks Rodney 's a spoiled brat , and would n't she like to trade places with him and be able to lounge around all day , smoking French cigarettes , instead of working her skinny butt of for the phone company ? She sits across from Rodney in a lawn chair and thinks how clean and rested and well cared for he looks . He looks like a rich man 's boy . He keeps a tan yearround , and they did n't take away his Rolex watch . Sometimes she envies him  --  all his trouble circumscribed by his sentence . Whenever she mentions Jack to Rodney , he looks at her with real pity . <p> Rodney 's only twenty  --  a minor in her book  --  but he sold cocaine and he wo n't be eligible for parole for another three years . None of their friends know because he was arrested somewhere up North , and now he 's stashed in Virginia . Everybody thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack when Rodney got a leave from duty , and Jack said almost never , that Rodney was stationed in the Caribbean on an atomic submarine , underwater six months at a time . The way Jack slid this lie right out , so quick and sly and practiced , sounded to Goody like the beginning of more trouble . <p> " Wow , " Pam had said , and she swooned toward Jack like he was really something for having his son on a submarine . " Is it a yellow submarine ? " Pam asked , grinning . <p> When she steps out of the shower , Goody smells the baking pie . Despite the herbal-scented steam of the bathroom , the hearthy fragrance insinuates itself , tricky and friendly both . A man in her kitchen is baking a pie , and who would have ever guessed it , what it would be like ? It should feel like having everything . She rubs herself hard with a towel , combs out her hair , slithers into some new red jeans and a tank top . She looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiat , her arms thin and shapeless as oars . She 's hard , hard . Her wet hair hangs on her shoulders like a drapery of nails . You work too hard , she says to the mirror . You think too hard ; you worry too hard . The only phrase that comes to mind when she gazes at her reflection is hard-headed woman . <p> Downstairs , no sign of Jack . The kitchen is piled with unwashed breakfast dishes , unrinsed pots , mixing bowls , clogged wooden spoons . The cabinet doors are flung open in all directions . The countertops need wiping ; there 's a fallout of flour on the linoleum floor . It looks like a kid 's been playing war there . <p> Then she sees the pie shell . Jack 's first pie shell . It 's sitting on top of the stove , cooling . The edge is fluted perfectly , a lovely sandy color . But the center of the piecrust , the pancake part that 's supposed to lie fiat , has risen , has swollen into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of Goody 's old thrown-away diaphragm . <p> Jack blasts through the back door , red-faced , still in his apron , winded . He 's been throwing a ball to the dog . The dog follows him , slinking , cowed by the invitation but aroused by the sweet smell of baking . <p> " What happened to it , Jack ? " Goody asks . " Why did it rise up like that ? " <p> " You tell me , " he says , " and make it a good one . " <p> " I do n't have any idea , " Goody says . " You act like I sabotaged the thing . " <p> " You said it , not me . " <p> " I wrote everything down , " Goody says . " I swear it . " <p> " You wrote everything down all right , " he says , unfolding the recipe from the pocket of his apron . He points to the last thing Goody wrote down . " ' Prick pie , ' " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a sense of humor ? " <p> " It means that you take something like a fork , and you jab at the dough , Jack . You make air holes so the pie can breathe . " <p> Jack unstraps himself from the apron and flings it across a chair , " It 's got to breathe , " he says to the dog . " You want to give it a little mouth-to-mouth ? " <p> " ' Prick pie , ' " Goody says , " I get it now ! " She covers her mouth quickly before she laughs too hard . " You thought it was an insult ? Oh , Jack ! That 's not my way . Come on , honey , that sounds like something Pam would say . " <p> Jack looks at her meaningly . " No she would n't , " he says quietly . His gaze seems to bolt her to the floor . He does n't blink ; he 's not smiling . " Not Pam . Not to me . Not ever . " <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrowfully . He squats down and sets it on the floor beside the dog . But the dog wo n't eat it . He sniffs it , whines , licks the pie until it 's glazed with his drool . Then he slinks under the kitchen table and lies down , looking scolded although nobody 's said a word . <p> Goody and Jack just stand there watching the pie the way Goody suspects you 'd probably watch the sky if the H-bomb were finally dropping . You probably would n't panic when the end was near ; you 've grown up all your life knowing it could happen . You 'd stand there waiting only for the roar of an illumination you had n't guessed at yet  --  that 's how it would be . You 'd think only about filling that cradle of space between the second you did n't know anything and the second you wished you did n't . <p> " You wanted to make that pie for one reason and one reason only , " Goody says softly . " You wanted to impress Pam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , but once she tells it , it feels absolutely right . Feels like she was born knowing it , like her whole life with Jack has been building toward this blast . And clearly , like some afterimage , she sees Pain coming to the door in a V-neck sweater , braless , barefooted  --  the sort of forty-year-old woman who still wears an ankle chain . She sees Pain open the door and gawk at this pie Jack is holding  --  his first pie , mind you  --  and it 's a beaut : the crust all fluted like a seashell , a perfect tan color . She sees Pam 's eyes loom first at the pie , then at Jack , then dismiss the whole notion because Jack is carrying the pie in that awkward way a big man will carry his wife 's pocketbook if he 's asked to fetch it  --  like it 's a contaminate : plutonium pie . <p> Next she sees Pam reconsidering because it 's just so queer for Jack to be holding a pie that she 's bound to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of pie Goody 's made  --  she 's cagey , Pain is-which is Goody 's cue to say , " Ask Jack , " while Jack stands there grinning , waiting for the compliments to roll in . Then Pam starts falling all over him , praising that pie . She says it 's cosmic . She pinches off a piece of the crust and tastes it right there on the doorstep . She swoon-rolls her eyes and smacks her lips . " Fandamntastic , " Pain says . Then she covers Jack 's hands with her own and gently lifts the pie away , regarding it with such devotion that it seems like a precious little baby they had together . <p> <p> By MARIANNE GINGHER <p>
