Section : SPENDING Automobile sales are down . Incentives are up . and you can knock $1,000 or more off the list price if you know the right numbers . <p> In the movie Cadillac Man , Robin Williams ' character and his car salesmen co-conspirators in sleaze raise their beer bottles in a Chinese restaurant and toast the motto of the dealership : " Nobody gets out alive . " So much for the movies . In reality , with auto sales down 10% from a year ago , most salesmen and manufacturers ca n't afford to treat their customers like prisoners anymore . That 's why this is one of the best times in years to get a great buy on a new car . Consider : <p> The average incentive is now a record $1,000 , and models such as the $15,000 Pontiac Grand Prix and the $23,000 Buick Riviera come with $2,000 rebates . <p> Ford and Honda , among others , have been quietly serving up so-called dealer incentives on some models  --  factory-to-dealership payments that give sales managers leeway to move cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can even occasionally find manufacturer-sponsored 2.9% financing that carries a payment-lowering four-year term  --  a relative steal compared with today 's average 11.82% car-loan rate at banks . <p> Despite these advantages , buying one of life 's most enjoyable products still ranks up there with a root canal as one of life 's least pleasurable experiences . Manufacturers are n't making the task any easier by starting and stopping their rebate and dealer-incentive programs . Chrysler , for example , just cut rebates from $1,000 to $750 on five models-Dodge Spirit and Shadow , Plymouth Acclaim and Sundance , and Chrysler LeBaron sedan  --  while introducing a $500 incentive for its stretch minivans . And some dealers continue pressuring customers into buying quickly . " The car business is based on not giving the consumer the time to compare prices , " says Remar Sutton , a car dealer turned consumer advocate who designed the CarFacts buyer information program for the Credit Union National Association . <p> For the smartest advice on driving a new-car bargain , MONEY interviewed a score of industry analysts , consumer advocates , lending officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas , 32 . Thomas ( pictured on page 124 ) , a service representative in the regional telephone voice-mail service of U.S. West in Denver , was told by a dealer that the 1990 four-wheel-drive Toyota Xtracab pickup truck she wanted would cost $20,000 plus $600 to $700 in add-on fees for freight and dealer handling . She flatly rejected the price , since a buyer 's guide provided by her credit union cited the dealer 's wholesale cost as a mere $14,400 . " They were trying to take me for all they could get , " Thomas recalls . Meantime , an auto broker she had consulted found her the same truck at another dealer for $15,231  --  only $831 over cost  --  plus $800 in state and local taxes . Says Thomas : " I just love my truck , and the price was very reasonable . " ( For advice on how to use such a buying service , see the box below . ) <p> Auto analysts agree on this key rule for making your way through the new-car market today : keep all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you have one , is one deal . Financing the new car , if you wo n't be paying cash , is another . And negotiating the new-car price is one more . Car salesmen like to jumble the three together , making it harder for you to figure out your true costs of buying and financing . <p> Before setting foot in a showroom , you should decide whether you want to join the 13% of new-car customers who lease instead of buy . Leasing makes the most sense if you normally borrow when purchasing an auto and if you plan to trade in the car within five years . You wo n't get : much of a tax break for taking out a car loan anymore : only 10% of the interest is deductible this year ; starting in 1991 , none of it will be . And if you like to trade in cars frequently , a lease could allow you to cut your monthly payments for a midsize model such as the $14,000 Chevrolet Lumina by 20% to 30% compared with a car loan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headache of selling or trading in your used car ; you simply return it to the leasing company or dealership . <p> Assuming that you 've decided to buy , not lease , these step-by-step strategies will help to keep you from getting taken for a ride in a dealer 's showroom : <p> If you plan to trade in a car , get a used-car price service to help calculate how much you can expect to receive for the auto . Once you know that number , you can determine how much money you 'll need from savings or borrowing to pay for your new car . You can get a fairly reliable estimate of your old car 's trade-in or resale value at your library , bank or credit union by leafing through the latest copy of the National Automobile Dealers Association monthly Official Used Car Guide , a pocket-size paperback . Many bookstores and newsstands sell a competitor : Edmund 's Used Car Guide ( $4.95 , published quarterly ; also available by mail from Edmund 's , 515 Hempstead Tpk. , West Hempstead , N.Y . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently introduced phone service known as Auto Priceline ( 900-999-2277 ) , which gives prices on used cars and trucks in your state . Cost : $1.75 for the first minute plus $0.75 for each minute after . You 'll probably get more for your car if you go to the trouble of selling your auto through the classifieds rather than by trading it in at a dealership . <p> Pay cash if you can ; if you ca n't , carefully analyze dealer financing or consider tapping an existing home-equity credit line . Automakers and dealers trumpet their cut-rate financing , but their lowest rates are usually only for loans that must be paid off in two years . Consequently , while the rates are great , the monthly payments are exorbitant . Such short-term deals are best avoided . One recent exception : Ford 's four-year , 2.9% loan on the sporty $12,500 Probe . Monthly payment : $249 . The other catch with below-market financing from a dealer is that if the model has a rebate attached to it , you generally wo n't be allowed to claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose the rebate because , as the table above shows , cutting the amount you finance reduces your total and monthly costs more than does lowering your interest rate . <p> If you must borrow , an existing home-equity credit line may be your best choice . ( Since origination fees on home-equity loans can run as high as $2,000 , it rarely makes sense to open one solely to finance a car . ) The advantages of home-equity lines for car purchases are that interest on them is generally fully tax deductible up to $100,000 and that the average rate , now 11.65% , is slightly lower than the average for auto loans at banks . Thus a taxpayer in the 28% federal bracket who wants to borrow $12,000 for a car will save roughly $800 over the life of a four-year loan by going with an 11.65% home-equity loan rather than an 11.82% loan at a bank . The tax break also makes home-equity lines $500 or so cheaper overall than a typical credit union car loan at recent average rates of 10.71% . Remember , though : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house on the line if you ca n't make the payments . <p> When choosing a new car to buy , do n't overlook today 's wallflowers . Inventory costs are a car dealer 's biggest expense and , with the end of the model-year coming in September , sales managers are especially eager to unload models that are n't selling as well as they did last year . Select one  --  such as the Dodge Daytona or the Pontiac Firebird  --  and you could be on the road to a bargain . <p> That 's how Pirie Jones , 32 , a Los Angeles talk-show hostess on the cable-TV E ! Entertainment Television channel struck the deal that saved her $9,500 on a TC sports car ( pictured on page 126 ) , a joint venture between Maserati and Chrysler . The car , which was not burning up the sales track , carried a $33,500 sticker price and a $6,000 dealer incentive . Jones told a local Chrysler dealer she would consider buying the yellow two-seater in the lot for " under $25,000 . " Later that day she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position by finding out how much dealers actually pay for the models that interest you . Here again , your library or credit union can probably help with the research . Ask to see a copy of one of the industry publications that show dealer costs for new cars and trucks . Two examples : guides from Kelley Blue Book and Automobile Invoice Service . <p> Look for a car 's invoice price  --  the dealer 's wholesale cost . As a rule , the dealer expects to make a profit of 5% or 6% over invoice . But if you drive a hard bargain , you can get a new car for 3% over invoice . So consider yourself a savvy negotiator if you pay no more than $300 over invoice for a new subcompact car costing $10,000 or less ( like a Ford Escort ) , $500 over invoice for a mid-price car such as a Buick Regal at about $15,000 , and $750 to $1,000 over invoice for a $20,000-plus car such as most Cadillacs . Cars in short supply and hot sellers , including many Japanese imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay at least $1,000 over invoice on the $15,000 Honda Accord , for example . <p> Learn what special deals manufacturers now offer on the models you like . An excellent source is the " Incentive Watch " column in the weekly trade paper Automotive News , available at credit unions and public libraries . This table notes the size and expiration dates of all rebate and low-rate financing programs offered by domestic and foreign car makers . It also shows which models have the incentives that manufacturers award dealers for unloading specific cars ; these incentives rarely appear in newspaper auto ads . Cars with such dealer incentives are perfect targets for hard bargaining , since the salesmen need your money to collect on them . Dealers will share their savings with you if you push . Currently , dealer incentives of $250 to $4,000 are awarded on an enormous selection of cars . The June 18 Automotive News " Incentive Watch " column listed dealer-incentive plans on more than 40 models , including the bargain-priced $6,000 Hyundai Excel , the $18,000 four-wheel-drive Isuzu Trooper and the $37,000 blow-your-doors-off Chevrolet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any lure . Rebates , dealer incentives and financing terms have a shell-game quality . Some deals last for only a few weeks . For example , Chrysler 's generous $2,500 rebate on its Dodge Raider sports utility van is scheduled to disappear Sept. 1 . <p> Do n't let a dealer stick you with last-minute add-ons that will inflate your purchase price . If you 're not careful , a salesman can tack on as much as $1,000 worth of extras . Stoutly refuse any hard sells for supposedly necessary protections such as rust-proofing and fabric conditioner . The metal used in cars today is already treated to resist rust , and that $75 to $100 anti-stain fabric conditioner for resisting stains is overpriced , says Jack Gillis , author of the Car Book ( Harper Collins , $8.95 ) . Stand fast against paying " dealer preparation " costs  --  usually $100 to $200 . These fees are already included in the invoice cost . <p> Above all , take your time . Do n't be afraid to visit five or more showrooms before committing to a car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Plymouth Voyager SE minivan , Linda Murray , 28 , a homemaker in Durham , N.C. , recently knocked nearly $3,000 off the $18,860 price she was originally quoted . " Taking my time was the biggest help , " says Murray . " I was not anxious . The salesmen would say : ' How soon do you want the car ? ' and then I 'd say : ' How soon do you want to sell ? ' " <p> by Jerry Edgerton <p> THE PROS AND CONS OF HIRING A PROFESSIONAL HAGGLER <p> Retired music professor Joseph Schmoll of Houston ca n't stand dickering with auto , salesmen . So when he decided to buy a 1990 Ford Taurus GL , Schmoll went to the buying service of Houston 's American Automobile Association . The AAA wangled the car for $980 below its $15.157 sticker price  --  roughly $1,070 over dealer cost . While conceding that a tougher buyer might have been able to negotiate a lower price , Schmoll says : " I 'm happy . I avoided all the hassle . " Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hassles  --  because sometimes your own hard bargaining can get you the car you want for slightly less . <p> Most buying services work the same way . First you tell the service the exact model and color you want and pay a fee of $150 to $800 ; local AAA buying services collect their $75-per-car fees directly from dealers . ( To use an AAA buying service , you must join the organization . Cost : $18 to $65 a year . ) Then the pro typically delivers the car to you at $100 to $1,100 above the invoice price . A low-cost national auto broker called Car/Puter ( 800-221-4001 ) operates a bit differently . For $22 , the company refers you to the nearest of its 600 affiliated dealers . There you are likely to pay only $50 to $150 over invoice for a domestic model ( $300 to $600 for imports ) . Lobbying muscle by car dealers has banned auto brokers in a few states such as Maryland and Texas , but AAA and Car/Puter are exempt because buyers pick up cars at dealers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have a car to sell , you 'll probably have to find a buyer yourself , since most services do not arrange trade-ins . And repairs may be slow if you take the car to a local dealer for warranty work . Chances are this wo n't be the dealer who sold the car , so you 'll be asking him to fix for free an auto that did n't earn him a profit . <p> SIZING UP YOUR MONTHLY PAYMENTS <p> As this table shows , reducing the amount you finance on a car loan can cut monthly payments even more than lowering the interest rate . In the first example , we assume you finance over four years $13,500 of a car you buy for $15,000 . The second and third examples assume that you get the price down to $13,800 and finance either $11,300 or $9,800 . Home-equity total payments are calculated on an after-tax basis for someone in the 28% federal bracket ; the other loans do n't account for taxes , since those write-offs will disappear in 1991 . Dealer-financing terms vary considerably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept rebates .
