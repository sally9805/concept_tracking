<p> WHAT the Canadian Klondike was to mining , this windblown , treeless island in the Aleutian archipelago is to commercial fishing . <p> The once-lowly pollock and other bottomfish species have become undersea treasures . In 1984 , 4,469 metric tons of pollock were landed in Alaskan waters by domestic vessels ; in 1990 the total hit 1.4 million metric tons . <p> Two catalysts caused the bottomfish boom off Unalaska : Americanization of the vast Bering Sea fisheries ; and surimi , a seafood paste used to make imitation crab meat and other foods . <p> But gold-rush economics clash with sound management of the ocean resources here . <p> The 1976 Maguson Act , amended in 1987 , established a 200-mile US zone , pushing foreign vessels out and giving American ships free rein . But while this has removed foreign competition , it has irritated relations within the US industry , and has created new environmental pressures in the Bering Sea . <p> Factory trawlers , ships 100 feet to 350 feet long with compact processing plants aboard , take more than 85 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Commerce Department 's North Pacific Fishery Management Council . <p> Owners of the Bering Sea factory trawler fleet , totaling some 70 vessels , take credit for creating the surimi market and say they are entitled to all they can catch . With a capital investment exceeding $1.1 billion , they can not afford policy changes that would limit their catch , they say . <p> " This is absolute life or death , " says Bruce Buls , spokesman for the Seattle-based American Factory Trawler Association . <p> But onshore seafood processors , now pressing the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to reserve half the Bering Sea pollock catch for them , say the mostly Seattle-based trawler fleet will lay waste to Alaska 's resources . Only the shore-based operations , they argue , are dedicated to preserving Alaska 's fish stocks . Their supporters , including state and local officials , this week are pleading their case before the council in Kodiak . <p> " I do n't think we can sit idly by and see ( the local industry ) all destroyed and , after the factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive off and go somewhere else , " says Frank Kelty , an Unalaska city councilman and seafood manager at Alyeska Seafoods Inc . <p> Meanwhile , fish stocks are threatened . Uncontrolled fishing in international waters just outside the 200-mile zone , where Alaska-bound fish are harvested by foreign fleets , is another threat , says North Pacific council member Henry Mitchell . <p> " The problems are not just the factory trawlers . The problems are , in general , fishermen and factory trawlers - there 's too many of them and there 's too few fish , " Mr. Mitchell says . <p> The crash of the Stellar sea lion , designated last year as a threatened species , suggests strains on the pollock stocks . From the Kenai Peninsula to the Aleutians , sea lion counts plummeted 75 percent in the past 15 years . Biologists say the animals , which feed on juvenile pollock , are starving . <p> SHEER waste is one of the worst practices in the frenzied fishery , critics say . A 10th the trawl-caught Bering Sea bottomfish is tossed overboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processing system ; the wrong species is without value to the offshore operation . <p> This year , the first that National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) observers have counted discards , factory trawlers threw 73,784 metric tons of whole fish overboard from Jan. 1 to April 7 . <p> Of the fish processed aboard the ships , up to two-thirds of the mass is tossed back after the most valuable parts are made into surimi or filets . <p> Sometimes the whole fish is discarded , usually dead , after the valuable roe - a delicacy in the Japanese market - is stripped from the females . Pollock roe-stripping is outlawed , but the practice continues for rock sole . <p> And concentrated waste dumping has " soured " areas of the Bering Sea , altering its ecosystems , says Larry Cotter , chairman of the North Pacific council 's bycatch committee . " The ground is completely covered with decaying carcasses , and the oxygen is depleted . " <p> Shore-based plants , in contrast , have an incentive to process all that is delivered to them because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex , where a new $12 million fish-meal plant opened last August , a use is found for nearly every part of the fish . <p> State-of-the-art computer technology produces surimi . Cod for the Portuguese market is split , salted , and stacked in an ancient technique . Fish heads and cheeks are processed for the Norwegian market . Cod stomachs , used for soup , are packaged for the Koreans . Fish meal is turned into livestock feed ; bone meal is also crushed and bagged . Fish oil is burned to heat the plant 's steamers . <p> But Mr. Buls , tired of the trawler industry being " villified , " says fishermen delivering to processors also can be wasteful . The newest factory trawlers have fish-meal plants and other equipment to capture the value of now-discarded fish sections , he says . <p> The trawl fleet 's growing bycatch of untargeted species also looms over the Bering Sea . Trawl nets that sweep the ocean floor are indiscriminate , gathering halibut , herring , crab , and salmon . Elderly Yup'ik Eskimos have complained that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty . Some 65,000 chinook salmon , a species dwindling in the Pacific Northwest , were snared in trawl nets from Jan. 1 to April 7 , NMFS reports . <p> Mr. Cotter says factory trawlers are eroding all West Coast halibut stocks by fishing in a Bering Sea zone formerly set aside as an incubator area . " We 're robbing the North American coast of its future recruitment , " he says . <p> Enforcement is indeed a challenge in this largely unregulated fishery that reaches into the Bering Sea 's unpoliced " Donut Hole , " the gap between US and Soviet zones . <p> Skeptics say the NMFS observers posted on trawlers are often inexperienced , susceptible to bribery , and victims of intimidation , violence , and rape . A fisheries police force is largely absent here . Only the Alaska Department of Fish and Game , which oversees shellfish harvests , has a full-time presence . The US Coast Guard has no Unalaska office . <p> Back on land , onshore processors also pose problems . Even before March , when the new $70 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the island 's freshwater supply . Processors have been cited for air and water pollution violations . Unattributed fuel spills and trash dumps now taint the sea and beaches . <p> Just who owns the Bering Sea fisheries is at the heart of the debate here . The factory trawler association has branded the mostly Japanese-owned shore-based plants , " Japan Inc . " An onshore preference would concentrate power in the hands of two Japanese giants , Nippon Suisan and Taiyo Fisheries , the association warns . <p> But onshore advocates , pointing to substantial foreign ownership in the factory trawler fleet , say investors ' nationalities matter little . Resource-conserving Japanese companies are better for Alaskans than resource-wasting Seattle companies , they say .
