Syrian President Hafez Assad ordinarily is no one 's idea of a cooperative statesman , not with his record as a bloodily repressive dictator . But Assad is shrewd enough to sense which way the winds of world power are blowing . So last week he accepted the American formula for a Middle East peace conference . That , in effect , made him the first Arab leader since Egypt 's Anwar Sadat to agree to public , direct peace talks with Israel : that is what the conference is supposed to lead to , after a brief ceremonial opening . <P> None of which necessarily means that a conference will meet anytime soon . At least one of Assad 's motives was to put the onus of blocking peace squarely upon Israel , should Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 's government balk at accepting the same terms . Shamir is alert to that danger , but he is far from avid for a peace conference . <P> So , as U.S. Secretary of State James Baker toured the region , the betting was that the Israeli leader would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Moshe Arens predicted to the newspaper Yediot Aharonot that Baker would leave without any agreement that " will bring about the meeting he wants to organize . " Even if Shamir accepted , right-wing parties would almost certainly leave his coalition and topple the government . New elections would then delay a peace conference further . <P> Even so , Assad 's move underlines the extent to which once unfriendly countries are concluding that it is prudent to please the U.S. , the world 's sole remaining superpower . The Syrian President had long been a client of the Soviet Union and a leader of the rejectionist Arab states that opposed any dealing with Israel . But , American analysts believe , at the end of the gulf war Assad realized he had reached a turning point : he could become the unrivaled leader of Arab radicals  --  or he could bid for status among the moderates . Assad decided , as one American diplomat puts it , that " the future is with the U.S. and with the Cairo-Riyadh-Damascus axis "  --  and that only the U.S. could help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter to George Bush last week , Assad accepted two U.S. ideas : that the United Nations send only an observer to the peace conference ( Syria had originally wanted the U.N . to play a major role ) and that , after the conference had broken up into bilateral talks between Israel and individual Arab states , it reconvene only if the participants agree . Israel in effect could veto resumption of the full conference . <P> Shamir and his advisers , however , do not want U.N . participation in any form . They see the U.N . as being implacably anti-Israel . One official further scents a propaganda trap in the proposal to give Israel a veto over reconvening a multisided conference . The purpose , he fears , is to enable Syria and other states to put all the blame on Israel if the bilateral talks deadlock and Jerusalem does not let the full conference meet again .
