<p> IMPEACHMENT AND TRIAL . BUT FEW PEOPLE TODAY KNOW THE STORY BEHIND HIS TROUBLED TERM . <p> Greeneville , Tenn. - The impeachment hearing began with a melodramatic warning from the president 's chief accuser . <p> " Unfortunate , unhappy man , behold your doom , " railed Rep. Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania . Others called the president a " despicable , besotted , traitorous man , " his career marked " by a degree of perfidy and turpitude unheard of in the history of the rulers of free people . " <p> And you thought Georgia Rep. Bob Barr 's been giving President Clinton a hard time . <p> The year was 1868 and the president was Andrew Johnson , a hardheaded Tennessee unionist whom Abraham Lincoln had tapped as his second-term vice president . <p> Johnson ascended to the presidency after Lincoln 's assassination in 1865 and soon found himself in a bitter struggle with Congress over Reconstruction policy . Considered a turncoat in much of his home region during the Civil War , Johnson as president was attacked for being soft on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became the only president  --  so far  --  impeached by the House and tried in the Senate . The vote was 35-19 for conviction , one short of the two-thirds majority needed for ouster . Johnson served out his term but was n't nominated for another . <p> His obscure and stormy presidency is getting more attention these days , thanks to Bill Clinton 's travails . But not much more . He usually gets a passing mention and little else . <p> So who was Andrew Johnson , and how did he earn his odd place in history ? And what , if anything , does his story teach us today ? <p> " That we 'd all do better to keep a cool head , " answers Alvin Gerhardt , director of the tiny Andrew Johnson Museum and Library at Tusculum College , near Johnson 's hometown of Greeneville in the east Tennessee foothills . <p> Paul Bergeron , a University of Tennessee professor who has spent 11 years working on a multivolume compilation of Johnson 's papers , says there are some obvious similarities between Johnson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it did in 1868 , and you had a Democrat chief executive who was n't going to back down . It was a partisan battle then , and it appears to be now , " Bergeron says . <p> There also are obvious differences . Johnson 's troubles had nothing to do with sex or deceit , although his foes did n't hesitate to demean his character . Johnson 's impeachment stemmed from his open defiance of a hostile Congress and specifically of a law to limit his ability to fire appointees  --  a law later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court . <p> Mark Corey , superintendent of the Andrew Johnson National Historic Site in Greeneville , speaks with passion about the legacy he preserves . <p> " When I came here I knew almost nothing about Johnson , but in studying his life and story this is a man I have come to respect immensely , " he says . " He was outspoken and stubborn but he did what he thought was right , and the only law he ever broke was one that would have weakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was thoroughly self-made , with no formal schooling . He 's the only ex-president ever sent back to the U.S. Senate . <p> At the historic site in Greeneville , a pleasant town of 14,000 an hour northeast of Knoxville , visitors stroll through a museum and two of Johnson 's homes . A short distance away , Johnson , his wife , Eliza , and their five children are buried in a stately hilltop plot that affords a view of the Blue Ridge Mountains . <p> Visitation is up because of the Clinton affair , but only a little , says Corey . <p> " It clarifies some of the issues at stake today , " says Janice Webb of nearby Jonesborough , Tenn. , touring the site for the first time . " I think some of the reasons behind the dispute are the same . There are policy differences and a Congress at odds with the president . That 's not to say what Mr. Clinton did was n't wrong , though . " <p> A few miles away , the Tusculum College museum houses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pock-marked oil portrait said to be used for target practice by his mischievous grandsons . <p> Johnson was born in North Carolina , the son of a poor handyman who died when Johnson was 4 . At 14 he was apprenticed to a tailor , but later fled his employer and for a time was wanted for escape . He eventually moved with his mother and stepfather to Greeneville , where he opened a tailor shop . At 18 he married Eliza , a schoolteacher . <p> Johnson built a prosperous business and took an interest in politics . With Eliza 's help , he polished his reading and writing skills and practiced public speaking by debating college students . <p> At 21 he became an alderman and at 23 Greeneville 's mayor . From there he jumped to the Tennessee Legislature and the U.S. House . In 1841 he was elected Tennessee governor , and after two terms the state Legislature sent him to the U.S. Senate . <p> Johnson was a fiery advocate for the white working class . In Washington he championed the Homestead Act granting free land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public education tax . <p> Johnson owned five slaves before the Civil War and never exhibited much interest in blacks ' rights . However , as the war loomed he viewed slavery as a tool of the Southern aristocracy , which he openly loathed . <p> " He certainly had racist beliefs that whites were superior and blacks inferior , " Bergeron says . " But when the war came along he was ready to renounce slavery because it had been bad for the South . He never wavered on abolition once he committed . " <p> Upon Lincoln 's first election to the presidency , in 1860 , Johnson took his stand by opposing secession . " I voted against him , " he said of Lincoln . " I spoke against him . I spent my money to defeat him . But still I love my country ( and ) the Constitution . " <p> To Johnson the issue was open and shut : The Constitution denied the right of secession , so secession was illegal . His stand made him a hero in Washington and a marked man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pocket of pro-Union sentiment . He stayed in Washington when the war started , a senator without a state . <p> In 1862 , after Union armies occupied most of Tennessee , Lincoln sent Johnson to Nashville as military governor . Two years later Lincoln , a Republican , was looking for a new running mate who could balance the ticket . He chose Johnson , the unionist Southern Democrat . <p> Johnson 's debut on the national stage got off to a wobbly start . He showed up drunk at his vice presidential inauguration after using whiskey and painkillers to fight a fever . In a rambling speech he boasted of his plebian roots , mocked the diplomatic corps in their " fine feathers " and left spectators shaking their heads . <p> Lincoln  --  who followed with his " with malice toward none , with charity for all " speech  --  rose to Johnson 's defense . " I know Andy , " he said afterward , " and Andy ai n't a drunkard . " Seven weeks later , Lincoln lay dead . Johnson also was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve and never attacked the vice president . <p> " I feel incompetent to perform duties so important and responsible as those which have been so unexpectedly thrown upon me , " a stone-sober Johnson said at his swearing-in . <p> Johnson allowed Lincoln 's widow , Mary , several weeks to vacate the White House , then moved in with most of his family , including five grandchildren . His personal life was hardly serene . One son , Charles , had died in 1863 after falling from a horse and another , Robert , was an alcoholic . Eliza was sickly and cloistered herself in the White House residence . Oldest daughter Martha served as " lady of the White House " at most functions . <p> Johnson enjoyed a political honeymoon for a time , but his war with Congress  --  and specifically with the Radical Republicans led by Thaddeus Stevens  --  gradually escalated . Johnson 's vision of Reconstruction  --  he preferred the term " restoration "  --  was to readmit Southern states much as they were , minus slavery and with leadership loyal to the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believed . <p> The Radicals pressed for greater federal involvement and black suffrage and would n't recognize newly elected Southerners in Congress . Johnson vetoed a string of Radical-backed measures , including the first Civil Rights Bill , partly on grounds that the states chiefly affected were n't represented . In most cases his veto was overriden . <p> Johnson spurned chances to forge deals with moderate Republicans , and the battles grew more partisan . Johnson 's foes searched vainly for evidence of financial misdeeds , and a few hotheads claimed he 'd conspired with Lincoln 's assassins . An initial impeachment attempt in 1867 , based on vague charges of " usurpation of power , " never got out of the House . <p> But Johnson 's foes soon had legal ammunition . Amid the policy disputes Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act , aimed at preventing Johnson from firing appointees  --  namely the Radicals ' chief ally in his Cabinet , Secretary of War Edwin Stanton . <p> Johnson , viewing the law as a direct challenge to power , moved to replace Stanton anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office . <p> In early 1868 , Stevens ramrodded an impeachment resolution through the House . Most of the 11 articles cited the violation of the tenure act ; others cited Johnson for berating congressional foes and degrading the office . <p> The Senate trial began March 30 before a full gallery of officials , their friends and reporters . Johnson never appeared at the trial and was muzzled by his lawyers , led by former Attorney General Henry Stanbery . He argued that the Tenure of Office Act was unconstitutional , adding that Stanton was n't covered anyway because he 'd been appointed by Lincoln . <p> The Senate voted May 16 , following presentations of the opposing cases , closing arguments and several adjournments . The Radicals knew they could count on 35 votes for conviction , but they needed one more . The pivotal vote belonged to Republican Edmund Ross of Kansas , who 'd been warned that a vote for acquittal was political suicide . <p> He voted not guilty and later said : " I almost literally looked down into my open grave .

" I fancy I can already smell the fresh mountain air of Tennessee , " Johnson said as he headed home . A month later son Robert died in Greeneville of an overdose of drugs and alcohol . <p> Despite his personal and political scars , Johnson 's ambition still burned . He ran for office twice and lost . Then , in 1874 , he was sent back to the Senate by the Tennessee Legislature , defeating three former Confederate generals . <p> " He always said that was the most important election of his life , " Gerhardt says . <p> Six months later , during a visit to his daughter 's house in Tennessee , Johnson died at age 66 . <p> " The history this man leaves is a rare one , " The New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in this country ; it would have been quite impossible in any other . " <p> The Times said Johnson 's " posthumous fame would have been brighter " had he never been president , but concluded : " Whatever else may be said of him , his integrity and courage have been seldom questioned though often proved . . . . He erred from limitation of grasp and perception , perhaps , or through sore perplexity in trying times , but never weakly or consciously . " <p> More eloquent , perhaps , were the last wishes of Johnson himself . He asked that his body be wrapped in an American flag , a copy of the Constitution placed under his head as an eternal pillow . <p> If it was popular vindication Johnson wanted , he receives it to this day .
