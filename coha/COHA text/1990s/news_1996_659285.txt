<p> The Federal Trade Commission decided that Time Warner Inc. may proceed with its $ 6.5 billion acquisition of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , a deal that will create the world 's largest media conglomerate . <p> The FTC approval came on a 3-2 vote on Sept. 11 , a day before it was announced . The two commissioners casting " no " votes argued the agency was being too strict in the requirements it was imposing before allowing the acquisition to go forward . <p> Both Time Warner and Turner have scheduled Oct. 10 shareholder meetings to approve the deal , and the merger is expected to close shortly after those votes . <p> The FTC said its decision , which follows the outlines of a settlement negotiated with FTC staff in July , will become final following a 60-day public comment period . <p> " This settlement would preserve competition and protect consumers from higher cable service prices and reduced programming choices by ensuring that competing cable operators , new technologies and future programmers can gain access to Time Warner-Turner 's customers and programming , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the FTC limited the influence of a major Turner shareholder , Tele-Communications Inc. , the nation 's leading cable television business . <p> The deal was valued at $ 7.5 billion when it was announced Sept. 22 , 1995 , but the value of Time Warner stock has sunk since then . <p> Commissioners Mary Azcuenaga and Roscoe Starek dissented in the approval vote , arguing the government should not have demanded any changes in the merger . <p> " To reach this result , the majority adopts a highly questionable market definition , ignores any consideration of efficiencies and blindly assumes difficulty of entry in the antitrust sense in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary , " Azcuenaga said . <p> Starek said : " If the reasoning of the complaint is carried to its logical conclusion , it constitutes a basis for challenging any vertical integration by large cable operators or large programmers .

That could include broadcasting the 24-hour news channel planned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp . <p> " While the proposed merger of Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting is one of the biggest and most complicated deals that antitrust officials have reviewed , the central issue it raises can be summarized in one word : access , " Pitofsky said . <p> The settlement also limits TCI 's investment in Time Warner to about 9 percent of the voting shares . TCI currently owns about 21 percent of Turner . Under the original merger contract , that stake would have become a 7.5 percent investment in Time Warner , and it could have been increased to 15 percent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 billion business created by the venture .

But so far the Dole campaign has agreed officially to cooperate only with Fox , which also will provide a one-hour prime-time forum for the candidates the night before the election . <p> Coalition members still held out hope for a standardized format that they believe will reach the most voters . <p> Ellen Hume , executive director of PBS ' Democracy Project , announced the appearances are scheduled to begin just before 8 p.m. the night after the last debate . <p> But one hurdle remains : the Dole campaign insisted it has not agreed to participate . Hume had noted that Clinton and Dole have disagreed whether the presentations must be live or whether Clinton can speak from the Oval Office . <p> PBS said it will follow the recommendation of the Commission on Presidential Debates to decide whether third-party candidates such as Ross Perot are considered major contenders and qualify for the offer of free air . <p> Paul Taylor , a former reporter for The Washington Post who spearheads the coalition , said the major networks will return soon with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' lead . <p> Conservative Group Says Media Coverage Less Liberal <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) - A conservative media watchdog said coverage of the August political conventions offered signs that journalists are curbing what the group describes as news organizations ' liberal bias . <p> " I am happy to say there is some surprisingly good news in our quest for balanced journalism in the national media , " said Brent Bozell , chairman of the Media Research Center . <p> The group has complained that the four major television networks have been quick to label Republicans " conservative " and conservatives " extreme " while failing to label Democrats ideologically . <p> But this time , the networks labeled Democrats " liberal " 71 times , compared to 30 instances in which Republicans were called " conservative . " <p> Yet , Bozell said Sept. 12 the networks were more likely to call Republicans " negative , " " mean , " or something similar . Such labels were applied to Republicans 34 times , while Democrats were so tagged 6 times . <p> The judge in O.J.

They may leave the room and sketch from memory but can not depict the judge , jury or court staff . <p> Fujisaki also has barred cameras , saying they would distract from the dignity of court proceedings and encourage participants to play to the camera .

" <p> " This has nothing to do with the abortion issue itself , " he said . " It is about citizens speaking to other citizens without restriction . " <p> The ruling arose from a 1992 Georgia congressional race in which Daniel Becker , a Republican candidate , used television ads that included photographs of aborted fetuses . <p> An Atlanta television station aired one such ad just before 8 p.m. on July 19 , 1992 , then asked the FCC if it legally could refuse to run such ads when children probably would be watching . <p> The FCC staff denied the request , saying Becker 's ads were not indecent . But when Becker later tried to buy afternoon broadcast time for a 30-minute advertisement entitled " Abortion in America : The Real Story , " the station said the ad was indecent and refused to air it except between midnight and 6 a.m . <p> Becker appealed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indecent . But the commission said that because graphic political ads can be psychologically damaging to children , broadcasters can refuse to air them when children normally would be watching . <p> The appeals court , however , said that by permitting broadcasters to restrict ads to off hours , the FCC was violating its own regulations that require stations to ensure candidates access to time periods with the greatest audience potential . <p> Fox Sports Net to Debut Nov. 1 <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - Fox Sports Net , the national alliance between the Prime Sports regional sports networks and Fox , makes its debut Nov. 1 . <p> Fox Sports Net consists of the seven regional sports cable networks currently operating under the Prime Sports name , as well as the Sunshine Network in Florida and Fox Sports Arizona . <p> " Fox Sports Net provides a ... network-caliber production and promotion delivered through local regional cable outlets , focusing predominantly on local teams , " Fox Sports president David Hill said Sept. 19 .
