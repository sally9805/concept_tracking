<p> " Bums . " That 's what Radio Havana called them . And indeed , some of the 125,000 Cubans who fled to the U.S. 10 years ago were thugs and hoodlums . But not photojournalist Eduardo Suarez . His is a classic American success story , even though his finances are a little out of focus . <p> The date : May 22 , 1980 . The place the dingy industrial port of Mariel , 27 miles west of Havana . The time early evening . There on the docks under a cloudless , moonlit sky stood television cameraman Eduardo Suarez , 30 , his bride of seven months , Betty , 22 , and her 55-year-old mother Rosa . Taking advantage of Castro 's temporary liberalization of Cuba 's emigration policy , they had come to Mariel to embark on a life of freedom . In just 18 hours , that new life would begin as it has for millions of immigrants in America , at the bottom of the social and economic ladder . <p> Slowly they filed onto a 50-foot shrimp boat named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 25 people . That night it sat low in the water , jammed with 80 or so refugees , some of them just released from Cuba 's mental hospitals and jails . Money ? The Suarez party had none ; it was illegal to take Cuban pesos out of the country . Belongings ? The clothes on their backs , a blanket and a single pillow . Hopes and dreams ? Of those they had plenty . And the next day , after a voyage that began calmly and ended with the passengers retching , salt-stained and exhausted , Eduardo , Betty and Rosa could begin to act on them , initially from a resettlement camp in a World War II seaplane hangar in Key West . There to greet them that steamy Friday afternoon were 3,000 or so of the 125,000 boatlift exiles who came to be branded " Marielitos "  --  a pejorative term that literally means little people from the port of Mariel . <p> Fast forward to May 6 , 1990 . The place the now abandoned seaplane hangar , long since cordoned off by barbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sultry late Sunday afternoon , is Eduardo Suarez , 40 . But this time he arrives as a 13-time Emmy Award-winning producer , director , cameraman and operations manager for Channel 51 , a Spanish-language television station in greater Miami , whose 605,000 Cuban expatriates ( 31% of the population ) make it the second largest Cuban city in the world . The intense professional , who makes about $65,000 a year , has come to film La Calma Despues de la Tormenta ( The Calm After the Storm ) , a documentary about the Mariel refugees ' fate . As he gazes at the hangar , the hair on his forearms rises . " Me erize  --  I have goose bumps , " he says , then adds , " I came through here . " <p> And he has barely looked back . In the 10 years since the May-to-September 1980 Mariel boatlift , Eduardo and his shy , practical-minded wife Betty have built an American dream . They both have good jobs he at the TV station , she as a $19,000-a-year draftsperson for the Northwest Miami engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch house along a canal in a middle-class neighborhood in Southwest Miami , complete with 33-foot swimming pool , coconut palms and , yes , a white picket fence . Cost : $86,000 , financed four years ago with a 30-year , 9.5% fixed-rate mortgage . They have a high-spirited and independent two-year-old daughter , Andrea . And they have all American aspirations a parochial-school education for Andrea followed by the college of her choice , as well as financial security for themselves . <p> But to realize their aspirations , the Suarezes will need to bring their finances into sharper focus . Like many immigrants , they have been concentrating on making money , not managing it-and their spending is so out of control that nearly 30% of their income remains unaccounted for . Then too , with Andrea to look out for , Eduardo needs to beef up his life and long-term disability insurance . And he and Betty  --  whose English , like Eduardo 's , is spotty-have yet to take the simplest and least expensive step to protect their daughter 's future making a will . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mariel refugees  --  belies the stigma that the Cuban boat people bear . Of the 125,000 whom the Cuban government allowed to leave in 1980 , only some 2,000 were confirmed criminals or mentally ill persons freed by Castro . " The U.S. has always wanted to pick the best brains of our people , " Radio Havana cackled at the time . " Let them also pick up the bums . " Although a few exiled felons were apprehended by U.S. immigration officials , most were not . " The conditions were too crowded , " says U.S. Army Col. Juan Armando Montes , who coordinated the reception . At the peak in early summer , he says , some 3,500 people were arriving every day . <p> As a result , within months of the boatlift 's end in September , some Mariel refugees had committed murders , burglaries or hijackings . Yet many others became model citizens . Indeed , says Lisandro Perez , chairman of sociology and anthropology at Miami 's Florida International University and himself a 1960 Cuban refugee , Mariels were driven less by politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make money and put their kids through college . " <p> The Suarezes are a perfect example . Eduardo had worked as a television cameraman on and off for seven years in Cuba in the 1970s . Top pay the equivalent of about $300 a year . But he was drawn to the U.S. after a 1979 visit to his ailing father in Miami ( the elder Suarez died last March ) . " In Cuba , " Eduardo explains , " you had to work closely with the Communist party in order to advance . " Trouble was , Eduardo never identified with any regime . " I just wanted to live up to my potential , " he says , " and I needed freedom in order to do it . " <p> The decision to emigrate , though , was excruciating . For Eduardo , it meant leaving behind his mother , brother and , hardest of all , five- and six-year-old Edgar and Elianne , his son and daughter from a previous marriage . Betty , though she had an older sister and an aunt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave her father Rolando , a contractor . " He could n't even speak the word good-bye , " she recalls . <p> The 18-hour , 104-mile ride on the Tropic Dream was peaceful at first . In the middle of the night , however , the boat began to pitch in rising seas . Betty and many others became seasick . And all were bedraggled by the time the captain  --  himself a Cuban exile-turned them loose in Key West the next day . The captain 's advice ? " The first year is the hardest , " he told them . " You 'll cry a lot and wish you never left Cuba . But then things will get easier . " <p> His words proved prophetic . The Suarezes moved into an eight-foot-by-10-foot bedroom at Betty 's aunt 's house . Eduardo found a $3.10-an-hour job as a photo lab assistant . Betty , who had studied drawing at the Instituto Tecnologico Oswaldo Herrera in Cuba , landed a drafting position that paid a scant $4,992 a year . Both were lonely and depressed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Betty , who grew up in a comfortable Havana neighborhood . " For the first 12 months , I even missed the walls . " Adds Eduardo : " I thought about my children all the time . " <p> Their first break came within two months , however , when Eduardo was hired as a cameraman for $4.50 an hour at Channel 23 , a nonunion Spanish-language TV station . They moved to their own one-bedroom apartment , paying $350 a month in rent , and stayed there two years while Eduardo advanced to chief photographer and Betty moved to the engineering firm . By 1984 , they were ready to buy a $54,000 two-bedroom townhouse in suburban Kendall ( " we thought it was our castle , " says Eduardo ) . And in ' 86 , they closed on their current dwelling . Call it Miami Nice the gleaming white interior of the 20-year-old home bespeaks extensive renovation . The money for the $30,000 project came from savings and a $7,000 , 18% consumer loan from Southeast Bank on which the Suarezes still pay $115 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eduardo 's career was booming . He was promoted three times at Channel 23 before becoming operations manager at rival Channel 51 two years ago . Eduardo has now won more local Emmy awards  --  13 , for outstanding camera work , producing and directing  --  than he has spent years in this country . But which Emmy does he cherish most ? Numero uno , for a piece about the 1982 crash in New Orleans of a Pan Am flight that originated in Miami . He still keeps a yellowed Miami Herald clip about the awards ceremony . " This award means a lot to me , " he told a hushed crowd of 2,000 . " It is true this is the land of opportunity . " Neither Eduardo nor Betty would move back to Cuba , even if Castro left power . Says Betty : " This is our home now . " <p> While the Emmys were impressive signs of success , the Suarezes ' greatest reward by far since coming to America was the birth of Andrea in May 1988 . " She is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eduardo , " and I want to give her everything I can . " <p> But when it comes to Andrea 's education , the Suarezes will not be able to afford their dreams unless they reform their spending . In some ways , life at Casa Suarez seems like one big fiesta . Concedes Eduardo : " I love having many people at my house . " Most Sundays , for example , eight to 10 members of their large extended families gather at the Suarez 's home for one of his specialties churrasco al barbecue , an Argentine beefsteak dusted with mojo criollo  --  seasoning salt  --  and grilled over hickory chips . Average cost for the feast $80 . The couple also enjoy dining out with friends at places such as Malaga , a $15- to $20-a meal Spanish joint in Miami 's pulsating Little Havana , and Christy 's , a clubby Coral Gables steakhouse where prime rib for two , plus wine , costs about $75 . On top of that , they go for lunch every day with colleagues from work . " Eating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , it 's also his Achilles heel , since he and Betty spend around $10,000 a year eating out . <p> With this and other spending , including the home renovation , the Suarezes have set aside only about $11,700 over the past few years . That 's simply too little , given their approximately $85,000 combined salaries . About 60% of the savings is in a 5 1/4% passbook account and 40% in a 7% bank certificate of deposit . Also , on the advice of a colleague , Eduardo rolled over $3,200 of his Channel 23 profit-sharing money into Individual Retirement Accounts invested in a real estate limited partnership and a money fund at Dean Witter ( recent yield 7.8% ) . Betty has about $6,000 in the engineering firm 's retirement plan , about 85% of it in a money fund and the remainder in a real estate limited partnership . <p> As for liabilities , in addition to the $4,500 they still owe on the home improvement loan , Eduardo and Betty have $4,500 outstanding on an 11.5% three-year home-equity loan . They took it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let balloon to $6,000 , mostly to cover the costs of clothing , gifts and furniture . The monthly payment is $115 . Auto loan balances total $7,248 on her ' 86 Thunderbird and his ' 89 Mitsubishi Galant . Payments on both come to $600 a month , and insurance on the cars costs another $1,400 a year . Eduardo 's and Betty 's life insurance and his disability coverage ( Betty has none ) come through Channel 51 ; the premiums , deducted from his paycheck , total $148 a year . But Eduardo 's life insurance would pay only about $1.30,000 on his death ( $280,000 if he dies in an accident ) and $60,000 for Betty in the event that her death is accidental ; otherwise , she is uncovered . On the disability side , Eduardo 's policy would pay two-thirds of his salary , beginning 26 weeks after he 's injured and lasting until age 65 . <p> These and other fixed expenses , however , amount to only about 70% of their income . The rest remains unaccounted for , although they think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty 's father came over from Havana for an extended stay last October and again in April  --  the latest in a stream of visiting in-laws . The Suarezes picked up the tab , including air fare , of $2,500 to $3,000 . In addition , several times a year , Eduardo sends packages stuffed with cash , Nikes , Nintendo games and the like to Edgar and Elianne , now 15 and 16 respectively ( " as the children get bigger , the gifts get more expensive , " he sighs ) . Eduardo says he can not put a figure on how much he and Betty have laid out to help their families over the past 10 years except that it amounts to " many thousands of dollars . " And every penny , he adds , was well spent . <p> Yet some of that money no doubt should have gone into savings . And even Eduardo seems to realize that now . " Before Andrea , I never really thought about the future , " he says . " I just did what I had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADVICE <p> THE PROBLEMS : Curb spending , make an estate plan and save for Andrea 's education . <p> THE SOLUTIONS : Start budgeting , write wills , shore up life and disability coverage , and invest in conservative , growth-oriented mutual funds . <p> MONEY asked Miami certified financial planners Joseph Ross of First Affiliated Securities and Harold Evensky of Evensky &; Brown to advise Eduardo and Betty Suarez on how to get their finances in shape . Recommendations : <p> Get a grip on cash flow . Although the Suarezes have fared exceedingly well in their careers , they wo n't be able to control their finances until they figure out where their money is going . For two months , the couple should keep a daily log of all their fixed and incidental expenses  --  " down to the penny , " Ross says . " The more you find to put away , the more you 'll have for Andrea 's future . " One way Betty and Eduardo can immediately and painlessly begin to save is by expanding the credit line on their 11.5% home-equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money to pay off the $4,500 balance on their 18% consumer loan . Interest on the home-equity loan is fully tax deductible ; that on the consumer loan is only 10% deductible this year and not at all in 1991 . First-year after-tax savings : $404 . They should not , however , use the credit line for extra spending . <p> Shore up insurance and write a will . Even before Betty and Eduardo begin saving for Andrea 's education , they should set aside enough money to ensure that she is well taken care of if something happens to them . " Andrea does n't start school for three more years , " Ross points out . " But one or both of you could die or become disabled tomorrow . " With the help of an attorney , therefore , Betty and Eduardo should draw up wills immediately and include provisions in them for Andrea 's guardianship . Probable cost : $400 to $800 . They should also supplement their life insurance . Evensky figures Eduardo should have $400,000 of total coverage and Betty $150,000 that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He recommended universal life policies , which combine insurance with tax-deferred savings , offered by Fee for Service , a no-load insurance company in Tampa . Cost : $1,400 a year for Eduardo and $510 for Betty . Eduardo should also boost his disability insurance to cover 80% of his salary , instead of 67% , at an added cost of $317 a year . Since Betty contributes about a fourth of the family income , she should also have 80% disability coverage . Her premium will run $340 a year . <p> Paying for school . Evensky estimates that 13 years of parochial school for Andrea ( including kindergarten ) plus four years of private college will cost more than $140,000 in today 's dollars  --  or $367,000 if college costs rise a plausible 7% a year . " If the Suarezes set aside about $1,000 a month and earn a moderate 7% on their money after taxes , " he says , " they can pay for it . " The $1,000 goal is admittedly a tough one , but the Suarezes should aim for it nonetheless  --  putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best returns of any financial asset ( about 10% a year before taxes ) . The Suarezes , says Evensky , " can afford to take some risks . In fact , with so many expenses ahead of them , they ca n't afford not to . " The planners suggest that Eduardo and Betty begin making regular contributions to a couple of conservative equity funds with strong long-term records . Examples : Lindner Fund ( no load ; 314-727-5305 ) and Mathers Fund ( no load ; 800-962-3863 ) , which are up 97% and 111% respectively over the five years that ended on June 1 . <p> Eduardo and Betty Suarez were slightly overwhelmed by the planners ' recommendations . But they started keeping track of expenses , as the advisers suggested , and expanded their home-equity , line of credit . They also planned to write wills and augment their insurance coverage . " We Ye lived here 10 years , and no one ever told us about these things , " said Betty of the planners ' advice . For his part , Eduardo was determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you really have to plan a lot , " he observed . " We must . and we will . " The leaking hole in their budget <p> Their expenses aside , the Suarezes are n't sure where nearly 30% of their income goes .
