Suddenly , it was all too easy . Ridiculous even . The impossible became the probable . The fool was being crowned king ; the tortoise was flying to the moon . Quite simply , my crosshairs were on the eland bull , and when I touched the trigger , nearly two decades of frustration would have a happy ending . Of the game I had seriously pursued during my hunting career , the eland had been the only animal to steadfastly remain unobtainable . Not that I had n't hunted long and hard , or that I 'm an unlucky hunter , it just seemed that the gods of hunting had decreed that the eland would elude me for all eternity . Like Sisyphus , the tragic figure of Greek mythology who is doomed to forever push a stone to the crest of a mountain , I seemed destined to forever follow eland tracks across the endless sands of Africa without firing a shot . Eland are the largest of Africa 's antelope , weighing upward of a ton , with mature bulls standing nearly six feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more feet of height , making the eland one of the most magnificent of Africa 's game animals . With such size and impressive fighting equipment , an eland bull could be a murderous force if he was so minded , but instead eland are timid creatures that would rather run than fight . And running is something they do very well . I learned this the first time I hunted eland . That was in Botswana back during the early 1970s when sport hunters were first discovering the hidden treasures of that remote land . It was my first safari , and like any first-timer , my ambitions were mainly focused on lions , elephants and Cape buffalo . Other species , such as eland , I planned to bag along the way whenever taken with the notion or presented with the opportunity . I hunted hard and had some good luck , but near the end of the hunt discovered that though most of my licenses were filled I was still short on eland . In fact , we had n't even seen an eland . Lew Games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing eland because we had been hunting in the northern part of Botswana . Eland , he reckoned , would be farther south , in the arid vastness of the Kalahari . So we packed camp into a couple of trucks and crawled south until , literally , we were up to the running boards in desert sand . The first time I saw eland they were a long way off and running . I do n't know why they were running , they just were , covering tremendous distance in a steady , swaying trot , their enormous dewlaps swinging from side to side as they dissolved into the shimmering desert mirage . For the next few days I learned the wrenching hopelessness of hunting eland in their own country . When other game runs away , it runs for a reason . When that reason is no more , it stops running . Not so with eland . They run for the vaguest of reasons . Even when danger is too far away to be seen or sensed they run , and they keep on running far beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insane marathon runner , building a barrier of distance so vast and difficult to cross that nothing can reach them . And there is no end to the land , no fence , no mountain , no river to stop them , nothing but thousands of miles of sand . The following year I was back in the Kalahari . It was the first safari of the season and the eland had n't seen a hunter for months , but they were still far away and still running . In three weeks ' time I saw plenty eland , usually in herds of 20 or more , but I never saw one that was n't either running or farther away than a half-mile . A couple of years later my pal Fred Huntington and I landed in what had formerly been known as French Equitorial Africa but at the time of our safari was being ruled by a bush-league emperor who called his kingdom the Central African Empire . We had come a long way and paid a lot of money for one thing  --  giant eland . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorful and wearing more massive horns . The spiraling horn of a giant eland can be four feet in length and measure more than a foot around at the base . I 'd earned an eland , and now was the time to collect . With three weeks to do it in , I planned to hunt eland every daylight hour if need be . I even hired extra trackers so that if one team wore out I 'd have a fresh team ready to hit the sand and pick up the trail . During those weeks I was charged by a lion and killed a record-book buffalo . I even passed up a shot at what had to be the world-record Roan antelope , as we were on the trail of an eland , and I did n't want to stop . But I never saw that eland  --  or any other . One day we followed the big tracks of a single bull for six hours . The scattered brush was such that we could n't see ahead for more than 200 yards , but the trackers figured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might get a shot , and I was convinced that this would be the biggest eland of all time . Mine . But then , for no reason that I could understand , the tracks became craters  --  the bull was running . The trackers shook their heads mournfully and slapped their legs , indicating that the eland was running hard , then pointed to the horizon . That 's when I decided I 'd had it with eland . But that all changed when Jack Slack called . Jack , a longtime shooting and carousing pal , had been the sales manager for Leupold scopes longer than the angels could remember and was about to retire . And his company wanted to show its appreciation by treating him to an African safari . Would I be interested in going , too ? Until that moment I had been suffering from African burnout : too many airports , too much paperwork , too many tse-tse flies , mosquitoes , snakes , greedy government officials and too many mean lions . But like an old warhorse who snorts to life when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Especially because George Martin , a good friend who heads the publications of the National Rifle Association , was coming , too . We decided to hunt Botswana , with the arrangements and details being handled by Jack Atcheson &; Sons ( 3210 Ottawa St. , Butte , MT 59701 ) . Our outfitter was Hunter 's Africa , the venerable safari firm that had outfitted my safari there two decades earlier . Most of the professional hunters I 'd met in Botswana back then were gone , victims of time and the sudden deaths to which professional hunters are heir , but one or two were still there , elegantly polite reminders of an era when safaris were leisurely holidays of the privileged few . Our jumping-off place was Kasane , situated near where the Chobe River joins the mighty Zambezi . It had been a squalid collection of mud huts and corrugated iron sheds 20 years before . Still squalid , the village had grown tenfold to include a service station or two , a motley collection of government offices , and rows of doorless beer joints where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to dump our gear in the Toyota hunting trucks and dash for the bush . A happy surprise was the professional hunter assigned to me : George Hoffman  --  an American ! By long established tradition , the ranks of professional hunters have been filled by Englishmen , Portuguese , Frenchmen , Belgians , Germans or natural-born Africans of European descent , but an American  --  never ! Somehow it just did n't seem proper , sort of like entering a mule in the Ascot Derby . But over the past several years a number of Americans have gone out to Africa and earned their professional license . Some have gotten themselves killed and others have just been laughable , but a small handful of Americans have proved that they can not only match their skills with the best , but even add some good old Yankee know-how . Of these , George Hoffman is the best I 've seen in action . I first met George long ago at a hunting conference and found him to be a keen rifleman and handloader . His pockets were filled with hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One idea in particular caught my attention , a magnum case united with a .416 bullet . This was to become the .416 Hoffman , the best known and most successful of dangerous-game wildcats , eventually evolving into the .416 Remington Magnum . Thus in George I acquired not only a knowledgeable gun nut worth listening to , but a proficient , American-speaking guide . Just how good a hunter this American was I would discover before too many days had passed . We were hunting in September , late in the safari season , and our plan called for George Martin , Jack Slack and me , each with our professional hunters , to hunt out of three separate camps during the first half of our safari . This was a mixed blessing because even though it allowed us to efficiently hunt vast areas without interfering with each other , it also meant that we would not get to share sundowners and relate the day 's adventures at campfire time . My primary interest was Cape buffalo because I was itching to try my brand-new Ruger M-77 Magnum in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , I 'm told  --  and Federal 's Premium Safari .416 loads . But we all know what goes wrong with the best laid plans . Mine started going wrong the moment we rolled into camp and were met by a gaggle of excited natives , all wanting to be the first to tell us what had happened during George 's absence . Nearby milo fields had been harvested and the empty fields were pushing up patches of tender grass . Eland had discovered the sweet grass and were feeding in the open fields at night . Eland , dammit , eland , my curse had followed me . I 'd promise myself not to hunt eland and had brought a license only at the last moment when George had said there was a chance we might happen across a stray bull or two . Now we were getting reports that several eland bulls had been spotted only a few miles away . " Hold on , " I snapped , " we 're here to hunt buffalo . If we start chasing eland , this safari will go totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George why ; even when bewitched by the exotic incense of an African campfire and solaced by the smoky nectar of Scotland , my tales of eland remained sad ones . Next morning we left a couple of hours before daylight  --  too early , I thought , for the short ride to buffalo country  --  and George was acting a bit mysterious . It was late winter below the equator and the morning was cold enough for a down jacket . Bietsi and Idea , George 's team of trackers , huddled shivering in the back of the Toyota , fuzzy balaclavas pulled under their chins . Our route took us past a settlement of grass huts where the last embers of the night 's fires glowed dimly and layered the still air with pungent smoke . The road sometimes disappeared altogether , and tress that had been uprooted and tossed in the trail by passing elephants had to be skirted and the route found anew . In places the sand was so soft and deep that we growled along in low gear for long miles . At a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin there was a tap on the roof of the cab and George stopped and switched off the headlights . Bietsi , leaning down from the back of the truck , pointed into the darkness and whispered a few words to George . One of the words was " eland . " Even before he explained , I realized why George had been so mysterious . We were near the milo fields , and George 's plan was to check out the reports that eland had been feeding there . " Get your rifle and let 's take a walk . We just might bump into an old bull . " When we reached the edge of the milo fields we found a narrow strip of tall , dense weeds growing along a narrow dry wash snaking across the field . By following the wash and staying behind the screen of weeds , we could get to the middle of the vast field without being spotted . Walking single file , with me at the rear , we 'd gone about a half-mile when I glanced over the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tips of eland horns ! For a long moment I just stood and watched , seeing no more than the top foot or so of the sharp horns of six or eight bulls . It was like standing behind a seven-foot wall while a silent parade passes , seeing only the bayonet tips of marching soldiers . Realizing that only I had spotted the eland , I snapped my fingers to get the attention of George and the two trackers , who by that time were several yards ahead . Pointing toward the weeds , I held my fingers over my head to imitate the horns of eland , then touched my ears to indicate that they were very close and could hear us . Bietsi and Idea , both of whom are half bushman , reacted instantly , dropping into a crouch and running ahead , searching for an opening in the screen that would allow a better look at the eland . By that time there was enough light to see fairly well , and for hundreds of yards ahead the dense grass remained impenetrable . Only yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was cut off by a wall of vegetation that would stop a truck . The frustration was familiar . As expected , the trackers never found a suitable opening , and the bulls eventually scooted out the far end of the milo field without me getting a shot . The next morning we were at the edge of the field an hour before dawn , hiding the truck in a far corner and walking a mile or more so that we were centered in the end of the field where the eland had escaped the day before . Finding our way in the brush with flashlights , we found an overturned tree at the edge of the forest that would make a good shooting rest as well as offer concealment from the spooky eland . My rifle was a David Miller custom Mauser in .338 Winchester Magnum topped with a 4X Leupold scope  --  scarred veterans of more than a dozen safaris and Alaskan treks . For once , rather than my usual handloaded 250-grain Nosler partition bullets , I was equipped with Federal 's Premium Safari load using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet would still be hitting hard , and a billboard size eland is a hard target to miss even at that distance . From where I crouched I commanded better than a quarter-mile  --  from full left to right  --  of the eland 's exit route . Now we only had to wait until daylight . The very difficult had become the very easy and my spirits were with the clouds . Surely the eland jinx was over . Day comes fast in the northern Kalahari . First the horizon glows with a thin line of blue sapphire , then an explosion of light blows away the night . In a matter of short minutes I could see 100 yards , 500 , a mile , and then to the farthest ends of the vast milo field . Nothing ! No eland ! Through my binoculars I could see a pair of ostriches , their long necks reaching to the ground , but no other creature . Bietsi and Idea , who needed to binoculars , made sad clicking sounds with their tongues . They were as puzzled as George and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be there . But I understood well  --  my eland jinx would last forever , and having become so familiar with failure , the disappointment was n't all that great . " Now you know , " I said to George , " about eland and me . " Bietsi and Idea pulled up their balaclavas for a smoke and regarded me in silence , wondering , I suppose , what sort of bad magic this stranger could have that would make huge animals disappear from the face of the earth . Before we had traveled many paces , Idea , and then Bietsi , began pointing at the ground and making back and forth sweeping motions with their arms . Crossing tracks . Eland ! The bulls had been there after all , but had left before we arrived . Perhaps lions had moved in , or possibly they had heard our truck , but they had been there in the night . " How far are you willing to walk ? " George asked . " Until I drop . " " Then let 's go find some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after mile , and walking in soft sand is exhausting ; but why not give it one more try ? If for no other reason than to convince George once and for all that hunting eland with me was a hopeless proposition . But then , I did n't know how determined George Hoffman could get . Our plan was simple . In fact , there was no plan other than getting on the eland tracks and following . It is the most primitive form of hunting , and the purest , but following eland in their own territory is a losing game . Our only hope was for them to stop and bed down , but that would be miles into the bush , far from the milo fields of Nunga . I carried my rifle rather than let one of the trackers do it because I knew that if we spotted eland it would only be for an instant and I would have to be ready . Once we passed a sable antelope , coal black with a white face , studying us from no more than 50 yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . The tracks wandered deeper into the bush without reason or apparent direction . Occasionally a single track or two would separate from the main group , and at other times stray sets of tracks would join the ones we were following . Following the eland 's trail was not difficult ; their hoofmarks were clearly visible in the sand , and in time each set of tracks came to have its own personality . We kept up a steady pace , walking fast , but even so I guessed that for every mile we covered the eland were covering two . But I was wrong . It happened so fast that I do n't remember it well . We had been staying close together , with Bietsi and Idea walking in front , their dark , slightly slanted bushmen 's eyes scanning the bush ahead . Then suddenly they were on the ground , motioning me down , too . I could see nothing , but the trackers ' urgent motions told me that eland were close . But where ? " They are bedded down under the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close behind me . " Let 's crawl ahead until you can get a clear shot . " With George at my heels , I bellied forward about 10 yards , pushing my rifle ahead . Then I found a tree big enough to stand behind and slowly raised to a standing position . Seconds later George was pressed behind me . There , scattered before us , utterly unaware of our presence , were six mature eland bulls . They lay on their knees , bodies profiled and heads erect . " The big one is on the far side , " George whispered . " All but his head and neck are hidden by that bull in front , you 'll have to shoot him in the neck . " Now it was easy  --  too damned easy . With the animal only about 50 yards away and a tree to steady my aim , there was no way I could miss . Pinching the rifle 's safety between my fingers and moving it slowly so there would n't be a metallic click , 20 years of eland hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to myself , " I 've earned an easy shot . " The crosshairs scarcely trembled when I settled them high on the bull 's neck , just behind his head . Then I began pressing the trigger , and kept on pressing until the .338 buckled and I lost sight of the eland . I called the shot perfect , but what I saw was a cloud of dust beyond the bull . All I could figure was that the partition bullet had gone through the eland 's neck and kicked up dust beyond , but George was shouting , " Shoot again . Shoot again . " But at what ? My bull had to be dead , but all I could see were eland crashing into the brush , almost totally hidden by their own dust . Then there was nothing . I had missed . For a long while I did n't believe it , but I had missed . I told George the shot had been perfect and that the eland had to be hit and down somewhere nearby , probably dead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trackers say the bull was n't hit when he ran away . " But to make sure , he had Bietsi and Idea look for blood . There was no sign , and finally I accepted the fact that I had missed . The feeling ca n't be described . Like missing the 100th shot at the Grand American Handicap after 99 straight ? No , worse . Like a girlfriend saying , " No , " to your marriage proposal after a 10-year courtship ? Worse . It was the failure to crown all failures . I supposed there was nothing to do but head back to the truck . The sun was overhead and our hemp water bag was nearly empty . But already George and the trackers were studying the sand for scattered tracks of eland . " Idea says the big bull went this way . " I could n't believe it . Following the eland had been tough enough when we were relaxed and moving slowly . Now George was proposing that we try to keep up with a smart old bull that had just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what the hell , I thought , this was the way eland hunting was supposed to be . Impossible . I promised myself that never again would I hunt eland . I 'd given it my best shot  --  literally  --  and had n't been good enough . When we saw the eland again it was as in a dream . Why it had stopped I will never understand . Bietsi and Idea only stood motionless when I stepped in between them . In all of that thick forest , the bull and I were standing in the only place that we could have seen each other from so far  --  more than 200 yards . Yet the distance was only a thoughtless abstraction , as was time . Probably it took no more than a second for the crosshairs to find their mark on the eland 's chest , but everything was in slow motion . The bull was facing me straight on , head erect . This was my final chance , a fast offhand shot . Then the rifle kicked and everything disappeared . I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bietsi angling to the side , and the two were shouting to each other . I could n't understand what they were saying , and I could n't see the eland . Was it running away ? " They say , ' Come quickly , you may have to shoot him again , ' " shouted George . He was running , too . And then I was running , working the bolt of my rifle . The bull had run more than 300 yards with my bullet in his chest . Then he had stopped and lay down for the last time . Only then did the impossible become the real . George and Bietsi went to find the truck and were gone for a couple of hours . Idea went to sleep and I sat on a log beside the eland , reliving a hunt that had begun 20 years before and finally , had ended . <p>
