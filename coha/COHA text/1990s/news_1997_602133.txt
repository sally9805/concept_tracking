<p> Guest CEO : Boeing 's Philip Condit <p> Sometimes good times are too good . Boeing , the world 's biggest builder of airliners , is having trouble building jets fast enough to fill a record number of orders . On Oct. 3 , it took the unprecedented step of stopping all 747 and newer 737 production for 20 days to remedy a shortage of parts and workers . Condit , 56 , talked with USA TODAY airline reporter David Field . <p> Q : Did any of your airline customers complain when you said last month that you were delaying their deliveries ? <p> A : We 've had some negative responses , but it 's important for the customers to know that we will live up to the letter of the contract , even if we are late only a few days on a delivery . The rapid buildup was in response to customer need . <p> Q : Who is to blame for the delays ? <p> A : It does n't pay to blame in situations like this . It 's a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest . The problems in the process are not in a single spot . It 's like a python swallowing a pig . What we are dealing with now are the results of things that were done 18 months or two years ago . We are asking , were the right parts ordered ? Did the suppliers get the right instructions ? And then we ask , did they spin up as they should have ? <p> Q : Questions have been raised by some , among them consumer advocate Ralph Nader , about controlling quality in a time of rapid growth like this . What 's your response ? <p> A : I think that their concern is what I would call a generic concern . It was n't specifics , but , " Gosh , you 're more than doubling your production rate . Can you keep the quality ? " The answer is yes . . . . The one thing we sell is the safety of our product . <p> Q : Can you plan for business cycles well enough that growth does n't surprise you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're only going to know one thing : You 're going to be wrong . All you can do is try to learn from the last time . <p> Q : Do you have any insight about predicting business cycles ? <p> A : The simple little red book answer is that people who can really see the ups and downs ought to be on the ( stock ) market . Can you call the corners ? A lot of people can call the slope . We 're on a downhill slope right now , or we 're on an uphill slope right now . The question is , where does that turn ? And that is notoriously hard to call . <p> Q : You 've hired 12,000 people this year , not counting the 63,000 you inherited with the August purchase of McDonnell Douglas . And last year , you hired 21,000 , for a current workforce total of about 225,000 employees . How can you manage this ? <p> A : When we inherited the McDonnell Douglas people , we knew we were getting good people . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful . You ca n't just hire a lot of people and hope that some of them are keepers . ( We 've ) done a lot more testing this time , looking for mechanical skills , because I can sort of measure that . <p> But I also want to hire really good people who can learn quickly , who have the aptitude to be those wonderful experienced people . And I 'm a lot happier in this cycle than I 've ever been before . <p> Q : But how do you manage them ? <p> A : Communications . Today , I can communicate with 85,000 at Boeing directly with the push of a little red button . And soon that will be 150,000 , and then 225,000 , with a single keystroke . That 's e-mail and other ways to use the modern electronics . <p> Q : So you do n't manage by going out and walking around ? You 're well known for just showing up on the line or in other work areas . <p> A : Sure , I pop in on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , a strategy . Certainly , most management styles go back to a militaristic communications organization . After all , if you 're Attila the Hun and about to go across Europe with a couple hundred thousand of your closest friends , you need a communications system . There still has to be leadership , but I think the organizational structure will look different . <p> Q : The organization may be different , but airplanes look pretty much the same , do n't they ? <p> A : There is a big difference in the way we make them , and the thing that I am most proud of is the change in our culture that led to the design of the 777 ( the large twin-jet that entered service in 1995 ) . It was designed by teams that worked in virtual reality , and by teams that came from different cultures in the world . And by our customers . <p> Q : An airplane was designed by the airlines ? <p> A : Yes , and that created a problem in some parts of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us things , and some people in the company thought that they were trying to tell us how to do things . They were n't . They were telling us problems . <p> Q : For example ? <p> A : They were n't trying to tell us how to design the wing ; they were telling us that the fueling ports ( inlets ) were in the wrong place on the wing . Or they were telling us that putting a light in the middle of the compartment that holds the black boxes may have been logical to us but was n't to them . They had the experience of bending down in the room to see the instructions on a box that is mounted low down  --  and finding that they were between the box and the light and so needed to hold a flashlight in their teeth to see what they were doing . <p> Q : You seem proud of the " Triple Seven . " <p> A : I like what happened . I like the fact that we decided to do some things differently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was happily jumping up and down on the first flight , why I was so excited : Did n't I think it was going to fly ? I knew it was going to fly . That was the culmination of a journey of doing some things very different , very exciting , and it worked . <p> Q : Tell us more about the cultural changes . I 've just spent two weeks at Boeing , and it seems like a pretty structured place . <p> A : When we painted the nose of the 777 with the slogan " working together , " we meant it . The plane was designed by teams , not hierarchies . <p> Q : Any other lessons ? <p> A : The importance of change . Of the 12 largest U.S. companies that were in existence at the turn of the century , only one is still in business . That company ( General Electric ) has changed dramatically . We 'll remain a plane-builder , but we are a different company . <p> Tip for success : <p> Learn to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . Sometimes , when a customers tells you a solution , if you listen carefully , they 're really telling you what the problem is. " - Philip Condit <p> Jets are n't built before they are sold <p> Q : Is airplane building inherently different from , say , cereal processing or widget making ? <p> A : Our business is very cyclical because of the ups and downs of the world airline business . We do n't build airliners " on spec . " We build to order because the product is so expensive . We 're not going to turn up our production just because we think next year is going to be a good year . <p> Q : But it 's always been cyclical , has n't it ? <p> A : ( This upturn ) clearly happened faster than anybody forecast . And you get into an issue where you 're balancing the needs and desires of your customers , which was , " We need airplanes , " and your own capability ( to produce them ) . If we had taken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-year increase , made it much more gradual and gotten fewer problems  --  and been less responsive to customers . <p> Q : Now you 're looking for thousands of skilled workers . Was that why you bought McDonnell Douglas ? <p> A : No . We were a company that was clearly the lead player in commercial airplanes . Eighty percent of our revenue was coming from commercial and we saw real opportunity in space , some of the defense markets , but we were n't going to get there by internal growth .
