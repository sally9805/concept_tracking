Halfway through the men 's 400-meter final at the world track and field championships in Gteborg , Sweden , last week , the leaders were even , making their differences seem mere matters of style . World-record holder Butch Reynolds , whose 43.29 has stood since 1988 , ran so tall and so long that Michael Johnson , with his lower knees and shorter gait , seemed a maxed-out trotter trying to stay with a thoroughbred . // But then , passing 200 meters in 21.3 seconds , the trotter began to sprint , and he showed a marveling world ( and a devastated Reynolds ) that he is the modern incarnation of Jesse Owens . // Owens , the hero of the 1936 Olympics , said he ran as if the track were the top of a hot stove ; he tried to snatch up each foot the instant he put it down . Johnson , burning through the third 100 meters in 10.45 , perfectly embodied Owens 's technique . Then in the stretch , running away , his lead yawning past six meters , Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Owens 's mechanics . // When Johnson was a single stride from the finish , the clock on the infield to his left still had n't reached 43 seconds . Johnson did n't look at it . Reynolds tried to . " I could n't see it , " he would say , " but Michael was so far ahead .... " Reynolds was sick with fear . " For seven years the record has been a part of life , a part of me. " // Only when he had crossed the finish line did Johnson allow himself a sidelong glance at the clock . Later , many watching the slow-motion replay of this moment would cry out in surprise : He wanted that world record . He did not quite get it . His 43.39 was .1 of a second shy , allowing Reynolds perhaps another week , perhaps another year of queasy stewardship. // In any other athlete a simple look at the clock , a passing betrayal of ambition , would hardly be cause for wonder . But in Michael Johnson we have a champion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range and his durability . // Indeed , there is danger that the whole of what Johnson went on to do in the worlds  --  running six preliminaries and three finals , winning the 400 last Wednesday and the 200 on Friday , anchoring the victorious U.S. 4 x 400-meter relay team on Sunday and moving the International Amateur Athletic Federation to consider changing the Olympic schedule of events to allow a reprise of his 200-400 double in Atlanta  --  may obscure the merit of his performances . // The 400 he ran , for example , was intrinsically superior to the world record . Johnson had to run three rigorous 400s ( 45.49 , 45.15 and 44.90 ) to make the final , while in 1988 Reynolds had gone to Zurich rested , as had his opponents . The men behind Reynolds in Zurich had better times than those behind Johnson in Gteborg , proof of the drain of the rounds in Sweden . // Johnson had not coasted to a stop after the 400 before the dean of European track experts , Robert Pariente of the French sports daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dieu , 10.45 seconds for the third 100 ! On the turn ! " he said . " Impossible . " Johnson had left his opponents so fast that he eased the sting of their defeat . Bronze medalist Greg Haughton of Jamaica ( 44.56 ) and seventh-placer Roger Black of Britain ( 45.28 ) held up their heads and said they were honored to be in Johnson 's wake . // Johnson trotted a victory lap , his satisfaction evident but measured . In part this was because he had to run a heat for the 200 meters the next morning , but it was also because Johnson is simply not given to dramatic displays . This , not so curiously , struck a nerve in the man who has given track wondrous theater. // Carl Lewis , before flying home to Houston to tend the strained hamstring that forced him to withdraw from the long jump , spoke with Ian Thomsen of the International Herald Tribune and said , " This world championships , it 's boring . The electricity is not there . There 's no buzz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomsen pried out of Lewis that the missing element was ... Lewis , or a suitable heir . " If that 's it , that 's it , " said Lewis . " The one American they 're trying to build up , Michael Johnson , he does n't have it . He 's not doing anything for them . " // But many athletes set goals and work toward them for reasons other than making themselves immortal , or even famous . Five years ago , when Johnson , not long out of Baylor , became the only man to be ranked No. 1 at both the 200 and the 400 , he began hearing that he had a chance to brand himself on our collective imagination . Johnson , who was called a nerd in high school in Dallas for his neat , scholarly , organized ways , found that possibility at best amusing and at worst distracting , which would never do . Even now , asked if his unprecedented double at the worlds made history or satisfied personal goals , he said , " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one else has done , and that turned out to make history . " // And to win the Gteborg crowd . " The people supported me before I 'd even run a heat here , " Johnson said . " One kid kept yelling , ' Magic , Magic .... ' " Once I figured out that he meant me , I was touched . I also think it was a great championships . " // Had he stuck around , even Lewis might have found these worlds mildly diverting . In the women 's 400-meter hurdles , the perfectly matched Kim Batten and Tonja Buford , both of the U.S. , did battle with hardly a thought of a record and in the process shattered a big one . Batten ( previous best : 53.72 ) and Buford ( 53.63 ) , great friends , found themselves inseparable as they swept over the ninth hurdle and into the stretch . Buford had led early , but Batten had her by a foot over the last hurdle . Yet Buford has often been the stronger finisher. // " If she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Batten said later . // " I leaned as best I could lean , " said Buford. // Batten just leaned better . Both staggered over the line too spent to react to the crowd . As the thunder grew , Batten was the first to sense what it might mean . She turned to the clock and was astounded to see it stopped at 52.61 . " Tonja , " shrieked Batten , " we broke the world record ! " // Buford was timed in 52.62 , so both women had eclipsed the standard of 52.74 established by Sally Gunnell of Britain in 1993 . Each chopped more than a full second from her best . " I said to myself last night , if I set a personal record , I 'd be happy with bronze , " said Batten . // If Lewis were not so jaded , he might have seen the 110-meter high hurdles race of the U.S. 's Allen Johnson . Johnson clobbered the third and seventh hurdles in the final but was uncannily unaffected , staying ahead of Britain 's Tony Jarrett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees buckled . Miraculously , he recovered to win in 13.00 , within striking distance of the world record of 12.91. // Or , if Lewis 's sense of drama demanded the spectacle of old enemies slashing at each other anew , he could n't have looked away from the women 's 200 last Thursday , though he might have wanted to . The world 100-meter champion , Gwen Torrence of the U.S. , ran a spectacular race , winning by more than three meters in 21.77 over Jamaica 's 35-year-old Merlene Ottey . But as Torrence was telling a TV interviewer that she had been spooked by the theft of her shoes before the race and feared sabotage , the scoreboard flashed the results . Instead of leading the list , Torrence 's name was at the bottom , accompanied by a dread DQ for disqualified . Replays had shown that she ran at least three steps on the inner lane line in the latter part of the turn . // The reaction by several of Torrence 's competitors was unconcealed delight . Torrence has been much disliked since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barcelona Olympic 100 , that some of those who had beaten her were aided by drugs . What Ottey said in Gteborg evened the score . // " She cheated , " said Ottey . " She ran about two meters shorter than everybody . " Even though , as eventual second-placer Irina Privalova of Russia pointed out , the error could not have made a difference of more than a few inches , Ottey 's words staggered Torrence . " She did n't hurt me as a competitor , " Torrence said the next day , her voice catching . " She hurt me as a person . I 've always instilled in my little boy that you do n't have to cheat to win . Now he 's at home reading that I cheated . " // It was inevitable , then , that Ottey and Torrence would meet one last time , anchoring their nations ' 4 x 100-meter relay teams on Sunday . They even got their respective batons in step with each other . Then Torrence outran Ottey by more than a meter . Pleasantries were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poignant return of a beloved champion , he should have been there to see the 800 meters of Cuba 's Ana Fidelia Quirot . The 1992 Olympic bronze medalist , who lost only one race between 1988 and ' 90 , had suffered hideous burns over her chest , neck and arms in a kerosene fire in January 1993 . While near death in the hospital , she gave premature birth to a daughter , who died 10 days later . By the end of that year she was back running . No passionate missions ? When Quirot presented herself at the start of the 800 final , the scars on her chest and legs shone dully in the Scandinavian sun . // At the gun Quirot took shelter from the wind behind Meredith Rainey of the U.S. and Kelly Holmes of Britain . Off the last turn , she drew wide , and there it was , the old stride , the old irresistible kick . Quirot won going away in 1:56.11 ( a victory aided , she granted , by the disqualification of Mozambique 's world champ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation ) . " This is , " Quirot said , simply and tearfully , " the happiest day of my life . " // If he could have stood all that boredom , Lewis would have seen that it was left to Michael Johnson to define the worlds with the 200 meters . Indeed , Lewis would have found himself agreeing with Johnson 's manager , Brad Hunt , who for some time has felt that Johnson 's stone face might be effective in competition but has given the wrong impression of the man . // " He is purposely isolated from his competitors , " said Hunt . " He 's never going to allow them inside . But he is so focused he almost isolates himself from his fans . At the end of last season , I said to Michael , ' You need to show the audience how much you enjoy what you do . ' " // Johnson took this under advisement . In the final yards of June 's U.S. national 400 , which he won in 43.66 , he tried a little vaudevillian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that just offended Reynolds , who finished second , and prompted cries that Johnson might have thrown away a world record by not running through the finish . No , waving did n't seem right . Johnson determined to let the moment suggest the gesture . // The 200-meter final at Gteborg had everything , even disbelieving opponents . Britain 's John Regis said he had never been able to run one fast 200 the day after a 400 , let alone three prelims and a final over two days . So every evening Johnson had turned himself over to a massage therapist for up to two hours to soothe away the stiffness . But his real secret , if it can be called that , is a lifetime of hard workouts done with exceptionally short rests . // The day was warm , the crowd expectant . As the finalists went to the set position , Johnson stared so sharply at a point in front of him that you expected later to find there a puddle of melted urethane . Yet at the gun he seemed to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out behind Brazil 's Robson Da Silva and Namibia 's Frank Fredericks . Then Johnson simply rolled past , not as a thunderbolt but as a gathering storm . He was a meter ahead off the turn and running with full power . He held his shoulders low in the last meters , and his downturning grimace showed that he was flat-out . // He won , looked again for the clock , saw that the time was 19.79 , equal to his best but still .07 of a second from Pietro Mennea 's altitude-assisted world record of 19.72 set in 1979 , and threw his head back in an instant 's lament . " It was unbelievable to come so close twice , " he would say . Then Johnson let his dominant emotions flood in . And what he did next should be where we depart these worlds . // Yes , Johnson would cruise a 44.12 leg in anchoring the U.S. 's 4 x 400 relay on the last day of the meet , when a cold wind bent the rushing birches and made you understand where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Johnson 's performances got the authorities to look at accommodating his hoped-for double in Atlanta , although IAAF president Primo Nebiolo insisted Johnson could handle the 200 semi and the 400 final on the same day , saying , " If he wants to run backward , he could do it . " // But the enduring image of Johnson in Gteborg should be his act after the 200 . He looked at the crowd , spread his arms wide and collapsed backward in a child 's gesture of exhaustion , relief and contentment . In that moment , spread-eagled and vulnerable , Johnson achieved all anyone , even Carl Lewis , could ask . This private man found a way to let us see exactly how much he enjoyed what he had done .
