What is golf ? You stand behind Casey Martin and watch him hit a dozen nine-irons . Time and again , a shallow divot flies and the ball rises above a backdrop of evergreens with a languid draw , dropping at last on wet green grass a few feet from the flagstick. // Martin 's swing testifies that he 's a player . He has that unhurried tempo , the balanced follow-through , those perfect little rectangular divots . Surely this is the essence of the game  --  player , club , ball , target . But then a young man runs up with a message : Martin is to phone his lawyer , " ASAP. " // The golfer thanks the young man , leans the club against his bag and starts walking toward the clubhouse . Or rather , he limps . Every time Martin 's right foot touches the ground , his left foot lurches forward to absorb his weight . // You can walk better than Casey Martin . So can a four-year-old . So can most septuagenarians . But neither they , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin did a few weeks ago with the aid of a golf cart . In fact , no one has succeeded at tournament golf by virtue of his walking ability . // So you wait on the range of the Eugene Country Club , watching members amiably slice and skull , and you ask again the question that the limping Oregonian has recently forced upon the governing bodies of the game : What is golf ? // Big questions make big waves . As Martin v. PGA Tour neared its Feb. 2 trial date , satellite trucks began parking next to the federal courthouse in Eugene . Guys in wrinkled sport coats took notes , and Court TV petitioned U.S. Magistrate Thomas Coffin for the right to cablecast the trial . Down the coast , the California legislature passed a resolution supporting the 25-year-old pro golfer , following the lead of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors , which recently praised the Stanford graduate 's " courage and honor in tackling an issue of interest to all Americans . " In the nation 's capital , a defeated presidential candidate wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Funny how big questions can nest in little issues  --  in this instance , Martin 's campaign to get the PGA Tour to let him ride a motorized cart in its events . The world of tournament golf has split into two prickly camps . One side , led by Tour commissioner Tim Finchem and legends Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer , argues that walking is a traditional and intrinsic part of the game and that Martin will gain an unfair advantage if he rides . The other side , which includes Tour giants Greg Norman and Tom Watson , says that shotmaking is paramount in golf , and the game will not be harmed if the Tour accommodates a disabled player . Of course , there are also many interested outsiders , from those who insist that Martin 's case falls under the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) to those who grouse that he is merely whining and wants special treatment . // " It was never my intention to make trouble for the Tour , " Martin said last week between prep sessions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . " Specifically , two years of dragging his right leg around various mini-tours had convinced him that shotmaking and course management were not enough . " Something had to give . I needed to quit ... or get a cart . " // Last week Martin probably wished he had asked for an airplane instead . He was deposed until 10 o'clock on Monday night by the Tour 's lawyers , grabbed a few hours of sleep at his parents ' home in suburban Eugene and then drove a hundred miles in the rain to Portland , where he caught a 7 a.m. flight to Washington , D.C. , for a press conference the next morning with Iowa senator Tom Harkin , who wrote the ADA , and former Kansas senator Bob Dole , who backed the legislation . After a tour of Washington landmarks , Martin flew back to Oregon on Wednesday , arriving home after midnight . " He 's absolutely exhausted , " said his stockbroker father , King Martin , " but he would n't have a case if there was n't an ADA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down the hallway from his father 's corner office at Salomon Smith Barney , Cameron Martin , Casey 's older brother , pulled a phone headset off his ear . " I urged him to go , and now he 's glad he did . But Casey is worn out . He keeps saying , ' I 'm going to forget how to play golf . ' " // This must be what fame is like . You wander through the television section of a department store , and Martin 's face fills all the screens . He is the newest icon in Nike 's " I Can " campaign . In his TV spots and in person , Martin , a Christian , is handsome , polite , earnest and bright  --  none of which , by themselves , would make him anybody 's poster boy . // At Stanford , where students with a range of abilities are commonplace , he studied economics , played piano at fraternity parties , studied the Bible , mentored a Hispanic youngster and led the Cardinal golf team to an NCAA championship  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a food crank with a condiments phobia . He shuns mustard , ketchup , mayonnaise and relish , and for a stretch in childhood lived almost exclusively on white rice . Which is interesting but not marketable . // And he keeps his leg covered . " The leg is unattractive , " he explains . " It 's not that I 'm ashamed of it . God created me this way . But it 's not something to display . " For that reason Martin was relieved last week when Judge Coffin ruled that Court TV could not televise his trial . " I 'm going to have to show my leg in court , " Martin says , " and I do n't want it on Hard Copy " // Question : Would Hard Copy want pictures of his leg ? // Answer : Yes . The tabloid show recently offered a Portland videographer several thousand dollars if he could get a clear image of Casey 's withered limb . // The pictures that really tell the story are the X-rays taken of Martin 's leg over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulatory disorder that causes blood to pool in his lower right leg . He lacks the deep venous system that would normally nourish the bones below the knee , so his tibia has become increasingly brittle . " You look at the X-rays , year by year , and the bones go from healthy white to dark and darker , " Martin says . " They 're deteriorating . " His orthopedic surgeon , Donald Jones , describes Martin 's right knee as " that of a 70-or 80-year-old " and warns that should Martin stumble or step in a hole , his leg could simply snap . The prognosis , if that were to happen ? Amputation above the knee . // " So many articles about Casey minimize the seriousness of his condition , " says his mother , Melinda Martin . " From the time he was a baby , he has lived with pain . He used to hemorrhage every few months , and each time , we had to splint him or put the leg in a cast . " // The Martins wanted their little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extraordinary . As a grade-schooler , he transformed his bedroom into a junior think tank and began cranking out straight-A report cards . When an aunt decided to get rid of an old piano , the Martins claimed it for Casey . Before long he was sight-reading pop tunes and wading happily into the New Age pianism of George Winston . // The most poignant part of Casey 's development was his attachment to his athletic brother , Cameron , who is 2 years older . Cameron played varsity basketball at South Eugene High and wound up at Oregon on a golf scholarship . Casey played sixth-and seventh-grade ball but had to quit because of cartilage damage in the weakened knee . Golf , however , was a game the two boys could share with each other and with their dad , who played to a 10 handicap at Eugene Country Club . " They never really competed against each other , " Melinda says of her two sons . " They supported each other in everything . " // They still do . Cameron did n't make last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happier if he had . " We keep pinching ourselves , " he says . " Casey 's tournament win , the Nike deal , the capital trip , the Greg Norman call .... " // Especially the Greg Norman call . Casey was in the Senate dining room , lunching with Senator Harkin , when he was asked to take a call on a phone in the hall . The caller was Norman , whom Martin had never met . " The Tour is putting pressure on me to testify on its behalf , " the world 's second-ranked player told Martin . " But I wo n't make a very good witness for them because I 'm on your side . I hope you get your cart , and I look forward to playing with you someday . " // Cameron , having told the story , beams . " It 's hard for people to believe , " he says , " but I get as much pleasure out of Casey 's success as he does . " // Now you 're at a table in the Eugene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have hardly enough guile to cope , much less prosper . True , he stares warily at the boneless breast of chicken on his plate ( " I ca n't explain why I 'm so strange about food " ) , but he answers questions about his trials  --  and trial  --  with almost saintly detachment . " There are a few comments I scratch my head over , " he finally concedes , but only because he 's pressed . " Someone said , ' They do n't allow mopeds in football , so we should n't have carts in golf . ' But there 's a difference , is n't there ? The play in golf is hitting the ball , which I can do , while the play in football is running to catch the pass . " // So you add this to your list of big questions : What is fair ? Giving Martin a cart might not be fair to Ken Venturi , who , dehydrated and nearly delirious , won the 1964 U.S. Open at steamy Congressional . And it might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Merion a year after his near-fatal car crash . // Those might not be fair analogies , either . " I love the stories about Venturi and Hogan , " King Martin said last Thursday , " but those stories miss the point . Neither Venturi nor Hogan was disabled . They had hope , and they had the opportunity to recover . " Staring thoughtfully at the Masters-green carpet beneath his feet , the worried father added , " Casey doesn't. " // Two days later , Melinda Martin sat in a living room crammed with extra furniture ( the Martins are building an addition to their house of 23 years ) and made roughly the same point : The Tour compared apples and oranges when it denied her son the right to ride . " There was no compassion , " she said . " Casey has always been one to follow the rules . He has never been a rebel or a crusader . At every stage of his life people have embraced Casey . Now he 's reached this level "  --  she shrugged helplessly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Actually , it 's the rare player who weighs in on the Tour 's side without first praising Martin . It is the Tour 's corporate response  --  conditioned by Finchem 's sincere belief that tournaments are public accommodations only up to the gallery ropes  --  that strikes many as anachronistic . The ' 90s , after all , have been a decade of inclusion , a period in which the game has shed its discriminating skin and begun to celebrate minorities , women , juniors and , yes , the disabled . // " We had such a neat team at Stanford , " Martin says to illustrate the point . " My senior year we had Tiger , who is black ; Notah Begay , who 's Native American ; William Yanagisawa a Japanese-American ; me , a handicapped guy ; and Steve Burdick , our boring white guy . I was the only player who came from a country club . I mean , we blew away every stereotype . " // The NCAA , when asked , blew the dust off the Rules of Golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Since turning pro , Martin has either limped or ridden , according to the rules of the tour in question . This year , he used a cart for two events on the Nike tour , the PGA Tour 's developmental circuit  --  but only because the Tour 's lawyers stipulated that he could ride until his trial . Showing extraordinary composure , as well as a flair for the dramatic , Martin won his first Nike start , the Lakeland ( Fla . ) Classic . // But the Martin family sees Casey 's window of opportunity as very small and closing . " I would be very surprised if he 's playing tournament golf 10 years from now , cart or no cart , " says his father . Casey 's mother thinks three to five years is a reach : " He could be in his backswing , " she says , " and his leg could just snap . " // So finally you stand behind Casey Martin as he plays the white spinet in the room just off the kitchen . His right leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his left foot . He plays with expression and power and  --  surprisingly  --  without melancholy . He seems transported by certain selections ( Winston arrangements of Pachelbel 's Canon in D and Bach 's Jesus , Joy of Man 's Desiring ) and energized by others . He plays Prince 's Purple Rain , Billy Joel 's New York State of Mind . // " I used to think years in advance , " Martin said last week , his trial date looming . " Now I just think about tomorrow . " // You look at the plastic milk crate on the floor , filled with songbooks . Then you look at the untroubled pianist , filled with hope . That 's when you consider asking the toughest question of all , the Bacharach and David biggie : What 's it all about ?
