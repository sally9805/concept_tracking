<p> In the nation 's capital in the 1880s , Henry and Clover Adams founded the Five of Hearts , ' an elegant circle who helped define an age <p> London had its Bloomsbury group , Paris the salon of Gertrude Stein . Washington in the late 19th century had Henry Adams and the Five of Hearts  --  an elite circle who helped define an age and whose gift for friendship connected them to the most influential figures of their time . <p> " Among us , we know all mankind , " Adams boasted of the Five of Hearts . He exaggerated , but not much : they knew Mark Twain and Walt Whitman , Henry James and Edith Wharton , Bret Harte and William Dean Howells , Horace Greeley , Robert Louis Stevenson , Bernard Berenson , Andrew Carnegie , the painters John La Farge and John Singer Sargent , the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and every President from Abraham Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt . The five and their friends are celebrated in a new exhibition , " The Five of Hearts : Henry Adams and His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 at the Smithsonian 's National Portrait Gallery . <p> Like many friendships , the Five of Hearts ' flickered into being by chance . It was the autumn of 1880 . Henry Adams and his wife , Marian ( " Clover " to friends ) , had just come home to Washington after a year in Europe , where Henry had been looking into the beginnings of American diplomacy for a book . A Harvard professor who had given up teaching history in order to write it , Henry left Europe with no regrets , convinced the future belonged to the United States . <p> He intended to watch from a front-row seat , in Washington , and by December the Adamses were settled in the capital 's choicest neighborhood , in a graceful three-story mansion on Lafayette Square , facing the White House . Out went invitations to tea  --  though not to everyone . With two Presidents in Henry 's family ( grandfather John Quincy and great-grandfatherJohn ) and a small fortune from Clover 's industrious Massachusetts forebears , the Adamses were unawed by power and wealth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms . What they craved were companions who amused  --  bright minds , lively conversationalists , cultivated men and women who displayed what Henry called " taste and dexterity . " <p> In the winter of 1880-81 , no one amused Henry and Clover more than Clarence King and John and Clara Hay of Cleveland . King , a dashing blue-eyed bachelor who wore his beard and blond hair cropped close , was director of the U.S. Geological Survey . John Hay , who had begun his Washington career at 22 as a secretary to President Lincoln , was serving as Assistant Secretary of State . King and Hay had been close friends for years , and both had known the Adamses slightly in the past . <p> Once assembled , the quintet met almost daily for tea , often dined together and soon solemnized their bond by giving themselves a name  --  the Five of Hearts . Though they left almost no record of these first encounters , it is easy to picture them in the Adamses ' high-ceilinged drawing room , surrounded by superb English paintings  --  Turners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine collector 's eye . Around the room , on elegant Oriental rugs , were potted palms and wine-red leather armchairs , cut low and small to fit their owners . Henry Adams stood just 5feet 4 , Clover 5 feet 2 . Hay was Clover 's height , Clara slightly taller . At 5 feet 6 and muscular , King was the burliest of the lot . In age they ranged from 42 ( John and Henry ) to 31 ( Clara ) . King was 38 , a year older than Clover . <p> Like most groups of friends , the Five of Hearts had a few traits in common  --  and many differences . Henry and Clover Adams were linked by the Brahminism of Boston , but John Hay , raised in Illinois , was a frontiersman  --  a species considered innately inferior by the denizens of Beacon Hill . Clara Hay , the daughter of an immensely rich Ohio businessman , rarely uttered a word and seemed a strange companion for her loquacious husband and his witty friends , who talked unceasingly and punned without mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye problem , Hay pronounced it a case of " cataract . " King leaned toward a diagnosis of " tom-cataract . " Clover , impatient with Hay 's reverence for the elaborate prose of Henry James , declared that James ' chief defect was not that he bit off more than he could chew but that " he chaws more than he bites off . " <p> All the male Hearts had won literary accolades : Hay as the author of comic verse and an editor of Horace Greeley 's New York Tribune , Adams as a political journalist and the editor of the North American Review , and King as the author of Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada , a collection of essays written during his years as-a geologist in the American West . <p> In politics , the Five of Hearts believed fervently in democracy but feared that the ideals of the Founding Fathers were being perverted . Henry Adams expressed some of his worries in a novel , Democracy , which satirized corruption and greed in the Washington of President Ulysses S. Grant and his successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democracy became a best-seller and the object of a national guessing game : Who had written it ? Outside the Five of Hearts , almost no one knew until after Adams ' death in 1918 . <p> John Hay thought America had less to fear from the rich than from the growing political power of immigrants , who in his view were too easily swayed by demagogues . He too would voice his apprehensions anonymously in a provocative novel , The Bread-Winners , which appeared in 1883 . <p> As women , Clover and Clara could not vote , but beyond that they occupied little common ground . Clara was the model pious , upper-class Victorian wife and mother . Clover longed for children but took no comfort in religion and chafed at the social conventions that kept women in the shadow of men . Clara was quiet and docile , Clover outspoken , rebellious and pungently clever . " Congress bumbles on , " she wrote her father . " Everyone laughs at its assumed spasms of virtue . " King admired Clover 's spirit but revered the " calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her repose , he thought , even Nirvana seemed " fidgety . " <p> The Five of Hearts shared a love of literature and , unlike their expatriate friend Henry James , who found his native land too lacking in nuance for the making of novels , they were ardently American . Henry Adams not only believed the future belonged to the United States , he dared to hope that he and his friends would be among " the first faint rays of that great light which is to dazzle and set the world on fire hereafter . " <p> For Henry and Clover , the only cloud on this bright horizon was the departure of their fellow Hearts . James A. Garfield would be inaugurated on March 4 , 1881 , succeeding President Hayes , and both Clarence King and John Hay took it as an opportune moment to slip out of Washington . The Hays were returning to their easeful life in Cleveland , where John helped Clara 's father manage his millions . In his spare time , Hay collaborated on a life of Lincoln with John George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Civil War White House . <p> King began his career surveying the mountains of California and in 1867 , at 25 , was named leader of the U.S. Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel , one of the most ambitious scientific undertakings Congress had ever funded . With a crew of 35 , he spent nearly ten years studying one of the wildest stretches along the planned route of the first transcontinental railroad , from the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada to the eastern slope of the Rockies . King 's team made maps , catalogued flora and fauna , and helped pave the way for settlement by sizing up supplies of water , coal and other resources . Widely praised , King 's work led to the creation of a permanent agency , the U.S. Geological Survey , with King as its first chief . But now in 1881 , eager to turn his knowledge into a fortune , he was leaving government to go to Mexico in search of the fabled lost silver mines of the conquistadors . <p> To Hay and Adams , King was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphs as a scientist and leader , the fact that his life showed no gap between idea and action won their admiration . In politics , the only arena where Adams had tried to exert influence , his one practical achievement would be helping draft , for Senator James Donald Cameron of Pennsylvania , an amendment calling for the recognition of the independence of Cuba from Spain . Adams ' thoughts invariably led to a sense of futility . Hay was less despairing but found it easier to carry out the wishes of others than to steer his own course . All three men considered public service to be an obligation . But A-dams waited for someone in government to ask his help , while Hay could not leave Washington quickly enough . Only King , they felt , had discharged his civic duties with pride and satisfaction . They might write history , but King would make it . <p> Listening to Henry and John praise King , Clover mockingly declared that she " never knew such fanatic adoration could exist in this practical age . " Henry observed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ; but women were many and Kings were one . The men worshipped not so much their friend , as the ideal American they all wanted to be . " Sure King would succeed , Hay and Adams were among the first to invest in his Mexican mines . <p> Garfield moved into the White House , the Five of Hearts said farewell , and without the others Clover found teatime a bore . She escaped it by taking long afternoon rides . Typically , the Adamses rode together in the mornings , and Henry spent his afternoons writing history in his study . But in spite of time and distance , the friendship of the Five of Hearts flourished . Shuttling between Mexico and a business office on Wall Street , King saw John and Clara in Cleveland and Henry and Clover on Lafayette Square . The Hays called on the Adamses , and the Adamses traveled to Cleveland . Scores of letters flew back and forth , many on stationery embossed with five small red hearts arranged in the playing-card pattern  --  the contribution of John Hay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hearts enclave on Lafayette Square , the Hays and Adamses acquired a piece of property at the corner of H and 16th streets ( present site of the Hay-Adams Hotel ) . King was invited to join but declined . Discouraged by a lengthening list of financial complications , he was also feeling oppressed by his bachelorhood . " I am human and could not bear the exasperating spectacle of your and Hay 's domestic happiness , " he confessed to Adams . <p> Adams and Hay went ahead , commissioning the most celebrated architect of the day , Henry Hobson Richardson . Though Clover disparaged Richardson 's Romanesque hulks as " neo-agnostic , " she was soon sufficiently absorbed to keep the Hays up to date on their house by recording the construction with her camera . Photography had become a passion . She hauled her big box camera to Rock Creek Park , posed her beloved Skye terriers with their front paws on a tiny table set for tea and made portraits of numerous friends , including Richardson , John La Farge , future Supreme Court Justice Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . A favorite among the Five of Hearts was her picture of John clasping a copy of Democracy to his breast as if he had written the book . The fact that critics variously accused Hay , King and both Adamses of writing it became one of the Hearts ' long-running inside jokes . <p> Photography was a welcome distraction from sorrows the Adamses felt but did not fully understand . For unknown reasons , they could not have children , which became a grief to Clover . Like many who came of age in the years just after 1859 , when Darwin published his theory of evolution , Henry and Clover were religious skeptics . After listening to the famous Phillips Brooks preaching , Clover lamented , " neither heart nor brain got any food . " <p> Clover eventually appears to have suffered a religious crisis . To Henry 's distress , she insisted that a cross be carved on the facade of their new house . Henry , perhaps struggling for a deeper grasp of Clover 's spiritual anguish , made it the centerpiece of another clandestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of Clover 's personal and physical traits , tries to reason her way to faith but concludes in despair that it can not be done . It would be years before Henry would share the secret of Esther even with his fellow Hearts . In the spring of 1885 , Clover 's father died , and she sank into a depression that never lifted . On December 6 , a few weeks before the new house was finished , she drank potassium cyanide , one of her photographic chemicals . <p> Her suicide was front-page news , and with public humiliation added to private guilt and sorrow , Henry vowed to survive by not looking back . " I feel like a volunteer in his first battle , " he told John Hay . " If I do n't run ahead at full speed , I shall run away . " Characteristically , Henry turned his grief inward . He was overwhelmed , too , by learning from letters of condolence how many sorrows others had endured . " What a vast fraternity it is , " he told his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " <p> Although the stationery with the red hearts disappeared after Clover 's death , the shock of her loss seemed to bind the friends closer together . In the summer of 1886 , while Henry traveled in Japan with John La Farge , Hay and King laid plans for another colony  --  this one at Lake Sunapee in New Hampshire , where the Hearts could summer with one another and a few special friends , such as Harper 's Magazine editor and novelist William Dean Howells . King instructed Adams to bring home a Japanese house for a corner of their acreage , imagining that he and John and Henry could pass their days there , writing history together . ( The serene and obliging Clara , King fantasized , would tend to their domestic needs . ) <p> Adams felt no attraction to Sunapee . Nor was King 's enthusiasm as deep as it seemed . In 1887 , unknown to his friends , he embarked on a romance in New York with a black nursemaid named Ada Copeland . King was 45 , Ada 26 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ceremony that included everything but a marriage license . There was one other lapse : the groom told the bride his name was James Todd . <p> Mr. Todd installed Mrs. Todd in a comfortable house in Brooklyn , and over the next eight years they had five children . As King juggled his two lives he spent long periods away from Brooklyn  --  pursuing mining ventures , playing the gentleman at the Century and Metropolitan clubs in Manhattan , and visiting his friends on Lafayette Square . Mrs. Todd thought she knew why Mr. Todd was away . He had told her he was a railroad porter . <p> Though King counted Hay and Adams his closest friends , he could not bring himself to tell them about Ada Todd . He grew so furtive that Hay began to suspect he had joined " some oath-bound order which pledged him , under fearful sanctions , never to tell anybody anything . " <p> The strain of King 's double life caught up with him in 1893 . Deeply in debt to Hay and further hurt by the summer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old spinal injury flared up . For weeks , fraught with tension , he was unable to sleep . One Sunday , exhausted and in excruciating pain , he stood before the caged lions of the Central Park Zoo . Someone bumped him , and he went berserk . He was arrested , booked on charges of disorderly conduct and carried off to an asylum . <p> IS CLARENCE KING INSANE ? asked the New York Sun . Adams thought not , but as he read the newspaper accounts of King 's breakdown he deduced that something remained untold . What it was he did not care . All he wanted was his friend 's recovery , and as soon as King was well enough to travel , Adams took him off to the Caribbean for a long holiday . <p> Back home , King was full of promises for Hay . The loans would soon be repaid , he vowed . " I have resolved . . . to smother and hide my pessimistic hate of civilization and be as straight-laced and wooden and fatuously American as anybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved of all the stable boys whom fate has raised to the nth power . . . and carry off the role of a good practical sensible American bourgeois cad , to the queen 's taste .... I have sinned , I own , in allowing my nature to influence my life . I shall do it no more till I am able to say to my nature , ' at last it is your turn , be free ! ' " <p> King loathed the tycoons of the Metropolitan Club , not because he shared Adams ' conviction that they were greedily ruining America but because the demands of their world stood between him and his first love , science . There was no " truer hero , " he believed , than the scientist who " never loses heart in a life-long grapple with the powers of the universe . " He seemed qualified for a place in the scientific pantheon , but supporting both his mother 's large household in Newport , Rhode Island , and his secret family left him no money or leisure to pursue his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excursion , Henry 's life after Clover 's death fell into a pattern of summers abroad and winters on Lafayette Square , where his breakfast table acquired the celebrity his drawing room once had . Served at 12:30 , a Henry Adams breakfast was governed by only one rule : guests must invite themselves . Friends were encouraged to bring new faces , and without being told , understood that the host would tolerate anyone but a bore . <p> When breakfast adjourned , Henry spent afternoons working on his magisterial nine-volume History of the United States during the Administrations of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison . He finished in 1889 , shortly before Hay and Nicolay completed the ten volumes of their Abraham Lincoln : A History . <p> After leaving Washington in 1881 , Hay showed little interest in politics . In those days , his friend Mark Twain hoped Hay would run for Congress , believing that the " presence of such a man in politics is like a vase of attar of roses in a glue-factory  --  it ca n't extinguish the stink , but it modifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glue-factory . " But in 1896 , at the prompting of Mark Hanna , a Cleveland industrialist and Republican kingmaker , Hay wrote generous checks to William McKinley 's Presidential campaign and shouted himself hoarse on Republican hustings . After trouncing William Jennings Bryan in November , McKinley rewarded the somewhat reluctant Hay with an appointment as ambassador to England . <p> Adams accepted the Hays ' invitation to make the voyage to Britain , but when he saw how little time the new ambassador 's schedule left for friends , he moved on to Paris . " London does not need me , " he concluded . He would not permit himself to say it was Hay who did n't need him , but when the two friends parted in the spring of 1897 , they headed in opposite directions . Hay was looking toward the new century and America 's emergence as a world power . Adams , wanting no part of it , had already sought refuge in the soaring cathedrals of the Middle Ages . Intrigued by these marvels of stone and stained glass , he threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that eventually led to Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres . <p> For his part , John Hay had no intention of abandoning Henry Adams , and the moment he began planning a Nile cruise for his first official leave , he sent word to Paris . " Mrs. Hay says you must go , " he told Henry . Adams replied at once : " If Mrs. Hay says I am going to Egypt with you , you may bet your life that it is so . " <p> On February 15 , 1898 , while the ambassador and his party lazed on the Nile , the American battleship Maine blew up in Havana harbor . By the end of April the United States was at war with Spain , and by August the hostilities had ceased . " It has been a splendid little war , " Hay crowed in a note of congratulations to his friend Theodore Roosevelt of the Rough Riders . Indeed it had . With the Spanish defeat , Cuba won its independence from Spain , and the United States gained possession of Puerto Rico , Guam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preliminary armistice agreement would soon be signed , Hay headed for the English countryside to recover from a kidney ailment . Surrounded by family and friends , including Henry Adams , he soon felt restored , but his leisure came to an abrupt halt in mid-August with a cable from Washington . President McKinley wanted him to be Secretary of State . After discussing the matter with Adams , Hay accepted , dreading the burden of office but feeling it would be wrong to refuse a President 's request . <p> Asked who would succeed him as ambassador , Hay said that if the choice were his , he would pick Henry Adams . Henry had a thorough knowledge of diplomacy , and the London mission had been almost an Adams family franchise : Henry 's father , grandfather and great-grandfather had served as ministers to England . With no standing in McKinley 's crowd , Henry knew he had no chance , but Hay 's notion pleased him deeply . " All my life I have lived in the closest possible personal relations with men in high office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one of them who has ever expressed a wish to have me for an associate in his responsibilities . " <p> As Secretary of State , Hay met with mixed success . He won applause in 1899 for his Open Door Policy in China , which put the United States on an equal footing with the European powers trading there , and for the 1901 Hay-Pauncefote Treaty , which gave the United States control of the Panama Canal Zone . But his popularity in London , which he assumed would be an asset in managing U.S. relations with Britain , turned out to be a millstone . In his first round of negotiations with England for control of the Canal Zone , he failed to consult the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . The Senate retaliated by accusing him of Anglophilia and rejecting the treaty , thus forcing Hay to scrap a year 's work and start over . <p> Adams watched in dismay , unhappy for Hay and for himself as he considered what two decades across from the White House had done to his own character . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to playing the spider , and squatting in silence in the middle of this Washington web , and I have seen so many flies and other insects caught and devoured in its meshes , that I have now a little the sense of being a sort of ugly , bloated , purplish-blue , and highly venomous , hairy tarantula which catches and devours Presidents , senators , diplomats , congressmen and cabinet officers . " Now his friend Hay was " caught in the trap , " he added , " and , to my infinite regret , I have to make a meal of him as of the rest . " <p> Still delightful and diverting despite his difficulties , Clarence King occasionally turned up on Lafayette Square , dreaming as always of bonanzas and the day he would return the $120,000 he now owed Hay . ( It was a mark of his spirit that King often signed his letters to Hay " Unremittingly yours . " ) He worked unflaggingly to support his mother and his subterranean family . Hurrying from one geological consulting assignment to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see your dear face every night when I lay my head on the pillow and my prayers go up to Heaven for you and the little ones , " he wrote from one of his trips . " Lonely seems my bed ! Lonely is my pillow ! " <p> He made his last visit to Washington in the spring of 1901 , just before leaving for the Arizona desert . He hoped the dry air would cure the tuberculosis he had developed . He died on Christmas Eve , two weeks before his 60th birthday . For the Hays it was a dismal end to a dismal year . In June their 23-year-old son had fallen to his death from a hotel window , and in September President McKinley had been assassinated . <p> Shortly before King died , he revealed his identity to Ada Todd but still could not find the courage to confide the story to Hay and Adams . If it was disapproval he feared , he sadly underestimated his friends . When they learned about Ada soon after his death , they were unperturbed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , " Adams said . " He was the ideal companion of our lives . " Hay became Ada 's anonymous benefactor , setting up a trust fund to provide her with a small income . <p> Grieving , and fatigued by his unending feud with the Senate , Hay talked of resigning from the Cabinet but settled for spending less time at his State Department office . He came home at I in the afternoon , read dispatches and wrote until 4:30 , then rang Henry 's bell . They took a walk and had tea with Clara , the Five of Hearts now reduced to three . <p> By 1902 , Henry was convinced that his day  --  and Hay 's  --  had passed . After dining at the White House with the Hays and the bumptious President Theodore Roosevelt and Mrs. Roosevelt , Adams told a friend that he and Hay had been " shoved up to a distinct seniority ; we are sages . I felt it not only in Hay 's manner , but in Roosevelt 's too , and it is my creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave Theodore to surround himself with his own rough-riders . " The 20th century , in which Roosevelt gloried , terrified Henry Adams : " This huge , great ghastly automobile of a country seems just about to roll over us all , and squash us into one enormous mince-pie . " <p> After the election of 1904 , Hay thought the President would name a new Secretary of State , but when he read in the newspapers that Roosevelt expected him to stay on , he did not protest . He died in 1905 , a few months after the new administration began , at the age of 66 . <p> " Hay 's death strands me , " Adams mourned . " I am now left quite alone , with no thought or wish except to follow as quietly and easily as possible . " Sensing the time had come for a summing up , he helped Clara edit John 's letters and diaries for publication , and he put the final touches on his own memoir , The Education of Henry Adams . One of the great autobiographies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't say as for what it does : though King and the Hays appear , there is not a word about Clover . <p> Chilled by the restraint and cynicism of The Education , Clara urged Henry to turn to the Bible for consolation . " You have said that all the good in your life has come from women , " she reminded him , without directly challenging the book 's most peculiar silence . " Will you not listen to the least among your women friends ? " Henry replied that he had pored over the Bible , to no avail . <p> In 1908 , hoping to live near her only sister , Clara began building a grand house in Cleveland ( now part of the museums of the Western Reserve Historical Society ) . Her sister died before the house was finished , and Clara never lived there . She died in 1914 , at 64 . <p> Between frequent laments that he had lived too long , Henry Adams had a thoroughly satisfying old age . In 1912 , after recovering from a stroke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live-in secretary-companion . Told of Henry 's interest in the Middle Ages , she had arrived bearing a volume of medieval French songs . When she sang a few , Henry , charmed by melodies that seemed to him to end " with their tails in the air , " promptly purchased a Steinway and sent to France for more songs . At 74 , he had acquired a new passion . <p> Aileen also took Henry for regular visits to Clover 's grave , which was marked with a haunting bronze figure sculpted by Augustus Saint-Gaudens . For 30 years , no one had dared to mention Clover in Henry 's presence , but after Aileen found the courage to ask him about his wife , he spoke of her happily and often . <p> In March 1918 , a few weeks after Henry 's 80th birthday , the German Army stunned the world with Big Bertha , an artillery piece capable of shelling Paris from 75 miles away . " Life has become intolerable , " Henry declared . " This is no world for an old man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He died before the month was out . <p> Years before , reflecting on the disappointments of his generation , Henry had decided that life was a bafflement . How ironic , he thought . He and Hay had spent years and vast sums writing histories no one cared to read ; his friends Saint-Gaudens , La Farge and Richardson  --  the best artists of their day  --  had failed to win lasting renown . After his own lifelong quest for knowledge he still felt supremely , irredeemably ignorant . <p> Casting about for the organizing principle of such a universe , Adams settled on chaos . What besides luck  --  or chance or fate or whatever one called it  --  explained how a man like John Hay , who cared so little for success , could rise to one of the highest offices in the land while the drive and brilliance of Clarence King ended in ruin ? Henry found comfort only in the thought of his friends , and he wished " they might be allowed to return together for a holiday , to see the mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mistakes of their successors ; perhaps then . . . they would find a world that sensitive and timid natures could regard without a shudder .
