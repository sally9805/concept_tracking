Every movie , it now seems , is a sequel of every other movie . Writers pick over the carcasses of hit films and try to extract the golden elements for their own projects . Why , it 's Die Hard in a minivan , or Pretty Woman but with Lassie and Beethoven , or Terms of Endearment only she gets the Ebola virus . It 's filming by numbers-last year 's box-office grosses . The uniform look and feel of recent films suggest that the mad scientists in A Clockwork Orange had it wrong . You do n't make a viewer a zombie by force-feeding him scenes of sex and violence . You do it by making every movie a dull retread , in a Mobius strip of mediocrity . <P> In this dumbed-down universe , the prospect of Batman Forever gave some hope . The series ' first two films , directed by Tim Burton , were the top summer hits of 1989 and 1992 ; Batman Returns was also a wonderful film . Joel Schumacher , director of Forever , has n't Burton 's creepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storytelling talent . He also wanted to give the series a fresh look , with a new Batman-Val Kilmer for Michael Keaton-in a new costume and car , both retooled in fine Corinthian leather . Even Gotham gets a make-over . <P> The only thing Schumacher and his scrupulous craftsfolk forgot to give the movie was life  --  the energizing spirit of wit and passion that makes scenes work and characters breathe . The script , by Lee Batchler , Janet Scott Batchler and Akiva Goldsman , settles for the stale pose of antiheroic dialogue and TV sitcom irony . Barbara Ling 's sumptuous production design is mainly a reminder of better , quirkier films ( Blade Runner , The Hudsucker Proxy ) . The special-effects aces have created a big destruct-o-fest , with explosions all over Gotham , yet the film is pizazz deficient . A series of set pieces with no forward momentum , Batman Forever drags laboriously , as if the Batmobile were being towed away with the emergency brake still on . The picture leaves thick black skid marks . <P> The plot ? Umm , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some bad people  --  but we know there was a lot of it . Lots of characters too . Robin ( Chris O'Donnell ) joins the series , which undercuts Batman 's heroic loneliness . Nicole Kidman , as the requisite love interest , is little more than a party decoration . And two villains are too many . Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as the Riddler have dueling star turns , with Carrey winning , of course ; he can torture the most innocent banalities , like a simple " Well , yes , " into delirious comedy . At the end he 's still there , potentially available for a fourth Batman . <P> And so the cycle continues . Maybe someone will bring vitality to the next film . This one just gives viewers a deeper case of the been-there , seen-that blues .
