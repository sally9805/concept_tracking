Thankfully , the author 's pet bruin , Buffy , is anything but neglected . was stopped once for speeding in my pickup truck . As the highway patrol officer wrote me a ticket , our pet , Buffy , poked his head out the open window , grabbed the ticket pad from the officer 's hand and ate it . The officer stared , speechless , then drove away and totally forgot my citation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black bear . Bringing Baby Home Thirteen years ago my wife and I adopted Buffy . A research facility that had been studying him returned him to the game farm where he had been born . Melanie and I knew little about Buffy 's past except that he could not go to a zoo or be freed to the wild because his claws had been removed ( we do n't know why ) And we knew he 'd probably be treated as a useless animal-and therefore killed-if left on the farm . So we agreed to take the 20-pound , 16-week-old cub to our Montana home . Before picking up our new baby , we read dozens of books on bears and got the state and federal licenses required to keep the animal . We spent $25,000 to build a sturdy chain-link pen around two sides of our house . We made Buffy a spring-fed pond , a playground and a den and gave him plenty of running room . Finally , we were ready for anything-we thought . Raising a Rascal The cuddly rascal who suddenly joined our family ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us unprepared . The first night , I lay in bed listening to his haunting cry . I crept out and sat near him in his den . After a few minutes he crawled on my lap and sucked the pads on his front feet . I hummed and rocked him to sleep . The first six months , I rocked Buffy to sleep every night . I spent hours feeding him , playing with him , watching him . Every sound or gesture puzzled me . Because Buffy 's muscle structure and coordination resembles that of a human , his play is very humanlike . Mentally , we find him much harder to figure out . As a mere 100-pound cub , he would stand and shake his head playfully at a neighbor 's angry Angus bull . Other times he would cower behind me at the sight of a small lamb .

One day Buffy , then 6 years old and 400 pounds , sneaked into the house while we were gone . For an hour he sat in our bathtub , tearing down the shower curtains and biting open every bottle of shampoo and conditioner he could find . He even turned on the water and smeared some toothpaste in his armpits and on the ceiling . What a mess ! But he was so proud of himself , I had to hug him . Watch Out for That ... Tongue ! When we first got Buffy , he nursed from a bottle . When I tried to wean him at 5 months old , he refused solid foods . Melanie solved that problem by substituting his bottled milk with water . Buffy took one suck and angrily threw the bottle across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . A second time he flung it . By that night he had abandoned his beloved bottle and ate solid food . Many things about Buffy we learned the hard way . I never appreciated how long his anteater-like tongue was until we were playing one day when he was still a cub . With a piece of candy in my mouth , I blew gently into Buffy 's face to watch his nose twitch . In a blink , Buffy snaked his long tongue to the very back of my throat . He licked my tonsils and stole the candy . While I gagged , my wife howled laughing . Finally , a Bond Develops Our friendship with Buffy grew painfully slowly . But one evening , I discovered a wild male black bear attacking Buffy 's pen . The wild bear had nearly broken down the door . I shouted and threw rocks until the bear lumbered off , then I crawled in the pen . Buffy 's tiny front feet-he was only about 5 months old at the timepumped out from under his fuzzy rump as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stopped and stared at me . Shaking , he clambered onto my lap and hugged me . I was crying . We cuddled for a long time that night . Finally we slept the night together , bonding and becoming family . Overnight I became not only his provider but his guardian . Wild Animals Are Not Pets I do not recommend wild animals as pets . Dozens of times I have seen tragic results with someone hurt or killed . A neglected dog becomes a 40pound nuisance . A neglected bear can kill you . That said , Buffy has learned that I exist to help him . I spend three or four hours each day with him . He trusts me so much he has bitten down on his own forearm while I cut open his paw to remove a sliver . Buffy 's play can be funny . When he teases the dog , he avoids a nip on the nose by going over to the closet and bringing back a broom to use as a poke stick .

Photograph Cub Scouts in Pack 649 , Belgrade , Mont. , know bears are wild animals . They visit Buffy under close supervision . // He can also be scary .

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hurt toe , dancing in circles on the other hind foot . Then , standing to his full height , he roared in my face . His humid breath fogged my glasses as we stared at each other for several tense seconds . Then he sat and rubbed his toe . I kneeled next to him and helped rub his hurt paw . Soon he nuzzled my nose , his gesture of forgiveness . I 've learned that Buffy has a keen sense of justice . If a stranger had stomped on his toe for no apparent reason , Buffy would have killed him . Guarding Buffy Most summer afternoons we hike in the woods or go swimming . Buffy loves to run free , eating berries , overturning rocks and tearing apart rotted stumps to look for grubs and ants . Because of hunters , we do not wander far apart . Buffy now believes that all people are to be trusted . Sadly , this is not true . The hunting of bears in Montana makes many cubs orphans . The cubs die slowly from starvation .

Time to Sleep , Bear During winter , heavy snows cover the ground here in Montana . To keep from starving , all bears sleep until spring . As the autumn air cools , Buffy grows thick hair . His compulsive eating adds body fat from which he draws energy during his six months of hibernation . Before hibernating in his strawfilled den , Buffy collects all his toys : a basketball , a tire , a skateboard and a big food dish . He sets these carefully around his nest . Then , protected from the icy winter wind and snow , he settles in for his nap . Melanie and I crawl into the darkness of his den for a short goodbye . If we stay too long , Buffy pulls straw over our legs as if preparing us to stay . Hibernation is a part of Buffy 's world we can not share .
