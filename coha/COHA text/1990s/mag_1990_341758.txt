Somewhere in eastern Montana , in the rolling , eroded hills known as the Hell Creek formation , paleontologist Jack Horner sips a beer and looks down at the most complete Tyrannosaurus rex ever unearthed . It lies on its left side , its neck twisted back pitiably . Horner 's crew has just exposed a section of pelvic bone to its first sunset in 65 million years , and someone remarks on the redness of the bone , like smoked bacon . <P> " It 's the comet , " says Horner , with a deep nod . <P> " That 's why it 's smoked , " his crew chief says . <P> Well , O.K. , maybe not . Have a beer , sit down in the gray sandstone grit , but do not attempt to reopen the great debate over whether the dinosaurs were wiped out at the end of the Cretaceous period by a huge comet or a vast cloud of volcanic dust or any of 80-odd other proposed killers , all of which Horner spurns . He has a rubber stamp that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE DINOSAURS ? Horner cares about how they lived . <P> Over the past decade , his ideas on this subject , based on a series of extraordinary finds , have helped rescue dinosaurs from the abstract realm of monsters , enabling people to view them for the first time as real animals . These theories have earned such respect in the scientific community that Horner , who flunked out of college seven times and was driving a truck in the family gravel business only 15 years ago , now heads the largest dinosaur research team in the country . Supported in part by the National Science Foundation and a MacArthur Foundation " genius award , " Horner oversees a staff of seven and six students . At the same time , his concepts of the social and family lives of dinosaurs have made him the bane of bloody-minded six- year-olds everywhere . <P> Horner has demonstrated that some dinosaurs were nurturing parents , raising their young in large nesting colonies and bringing their offspring berries and green vegetation , much as do birds . He has shown that the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horner puts it more plainly ; until maturity they were gawky , with such vulnerable traits as enlarged heads , big eyes and shortened snouts , which theorists of animal behavior believe elicit the nurturing response in humans and other child-rearing species . <P> In place of the familiar panoramas of flesh-ripping Godzillas , Horner describes the most common dinosaurs as " the cows of the Mesozoic . " He has found the remnants of one dinosaur herd  --  an estimated 10,000 waddling , plant-eating duckbills . Even Tyrannosaurus rex seems less terrible in his revisionist view . Horner believes it followed herds of triceratops , scavenging carcasses and occasionally preying on weak individuals , much as hyenas follow wildebeests in Africa . Artists ' renderings of pitched battles in which a triceratops tries to gore a tyrannosaurus in the belly are misleading . Triceratops was more likely to use its horns as a modern deer uses its antlers , not mainly for battle but to establish dominance in the herd and attract a mate .                @ @ @ @ @
