Section : U.S. News Everyone loves polls . But can you trust them ? <p> When the Republicans were deciding what to put in the budget that they now must negotiate with President Clinton , they consulted the polls , which told them that promising to " put the government on a diet " is popular . When the president was trying to decide how hard to fight the Republicans ' budget plans during the recent government shutdown , he consulted the polls , which said that accusing the Republicans of trying to cut Medicare scores points . And when the media wanted to know what to make of it all , they consulted the polls , too . Nearly every day of the budget stalemate , at least one major news organization released a new poll showing whom the public " blamed . " <p> Polls have become for modern politicians and pundits what the oracle at Delphi was to the ancient Greeks and Merlin was to King Arthur : a mysterious and almost divine source of wisdom . There are polls to help politicians decide which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of them , and what epithets to use for government employees , if they 're against them ( call them " foster homes " and " bureaucrats " ) . There are polls to tell them what kind of shirt to wear ( the checkered , lumberjack variety ) . There are polls to tell them everything except how to behave with integrity , judgment and honesty . <p> Pollmania . The sheer number of polls being conducted is staggering . President Kennedy commissioned 16 polls in the three years he was in the White House . Richard Nixon did 233 during his six years in office . During President Clinton 's first 2 1/2 years in office , the Democratic National Committee paid pollster Stanley Greenberg more than $4.5 million for White House polling , which is enough to buy about 100 to 150 polls . <p> Politicians have now become so conditioned to polling first and deciding later , writes Brian Tringali of the polling firm the Tarrance Group , that some are virtually incapable of " making a decision without it . " Pollsters now can  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment 's notice and have results to the candidate often within a few hours , " Tringali notes . <p> That polls have replaced judgment in the conduct and coverage of American politics is scary enough . Scarier is what a shoddy substitute they are . On a narrow range of clear , well-defined issues that people have thought about carefully and hold strong views on ( such as how they will vote in tomorrow 's presidential election ) , a well-designed poll can accurately reflect the views of the electorate . ( Even here , however , spectacular bloopers have occurred , such as the polls ' failure to predict John Major 's victory in the 1992 British election or the Republicans ' sweep last fall . ) But on nearly everything else , polls are inaccurate , speculative , volatile and often utterly devoid of the meaning that politicians , pollsters and the press all eagerly impute to them . <p> 1 . The " margin of error " is the least of it . A survey of 1,000 Americans will typically be reported to have a sampling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who takes that figure as a literal statement of a poll 's accuracy is making a big mistake . <p> For starters , the official margin of error reflects only the most obvious source of uncertainty  --  the chance that a randomly drawn sample of people may not perfectly reflect the nation as a whole . But other sources of error  --  intentional or unintentional bias in the wording of questions , for instance  --  can introduce a source of error 10 times as great as the " margin of error . " <p> Another increasingly serious problem is that the margin of error means something only if the sample is truly random . Pick 10 chits out of a hat that contains 50 red chits and 50 blue chits , and a statistician can tell you what the chances are that you might end up with something other than five of each . But a statistician ca n't tell you anything about the odds if all the red chits are bunched up in one corner and you do n't shake the hat first . <p> These days , pollsters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their initial random samples hide behind telephone-answering machines , do n't answer the phone or simply refuse to answer their questions . That makes the sample nonrandom . Many argue that the problem is not serious enough to skew the results , but pollster and statistician Warren Mitofsky , who invented the key telephone-polling technique used today , warns that no one knows what the people who did n't answer would have said if they had answered . One survey strongly suggests that the people pollsters ca n't reach may hold different views from people who are more accessible : Those who own answering machines and who use them to screen calls are more affluent , more likely to live in suburbs than in cities or rural areas and better educated than average Americans . <p> A well-conducted poll will make six or seven attempts to call back people in the original random sample who do n't answer or refuse to cooperate on the first try . Bad polls  --  especially overnight polls  --  do no callbacks at all . " There 's no such thing as a margin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When you 're doing something in the survey procedure that does n't even allow you to calculate a margin of error , then what are you talking about ? " <p> Even assuming that samples are perfectly random , the media often do a poor job of explaining what the margin of error means . Most polls report the margin of error at a 95 percent confidence level , which means that if the same poll were taken repeatedly , the result would be within the margin of error 95 percent of the time . But the margin applies only to the total sample ; breaking out the responses of men versus women , or Republicans versus Democrats , as is often done , results in small subgroups with a correspondingly greater error margin . Press reports of polls often do n't make this clear ; television reports almost never do . A sample of 400 Americans , for example , would include only about 60 Republican men  --  a ludicrously small sample to attribute any significance to . <p> News stories based on polls sometimes blithely ignore even their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 percent margin of error showing an 8-point , 54-to-46 lead for one candidate is generally reported as a clear lead for Candidate A. But if the poll were off by 5 points on each candidate  --  within its margin of error  --  Candidate A actually would be trailing by 49 to 51 . Similarly , many trumpeted " trends " that appear to show a candidate gaining are nothing but fluctuations within the margin of error . " I would n't get excited about small changes on a day-to-day basis , " says Mitofsky . " Candidates do it  --  but remember , you should never believe a candidate . " <p> 2 . Amateurs slant polls with loaded questions . Professionals do it more subtly . Ask people if the country has health care problems or a health care crisis , and 55 percent say " crisis . " Ask them if the country has a health care crisis or health care problems , and 61 percent say " problems . " Ask them to compare tennis to soccer , and 65 percent say soccer is more exciting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent say tennis is more exciting . <p> Mind you , these results were obtained when pollsters were n't even trying to cook the results . " What we 're discovering more and more is that very simple little things can have major consequences , " says political scientist Herbert Asher of Ohio State University , author of Polling and the Public : What Every Citizen Should Know . Recent academic studies have found huge effects from seemingly innocuous differences in the way questions are worded or ordered . <p> For example , politicians always do better on favorability ratings when people are asked to rank them on an " approval scale "  --  approve strongly , approve somewhat , disapprove somewhat , disapprove strongly  --  as opposed to rating them excellent , good , fair or poor . The reason , says one leading political pollster , is that " fair ' gives people an easy out . " It 's easier to call someone " fair " than to come right out and say that you " disapprove " of him . " If I 'm doing a poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results , I 'll say , Do n't use excellent/good , use approve/disapprove , ' " he says . <p> Both the media and interest groups often seize on seemingly dramatic poll results while ignoring the effect that the wording of the questions may have had . Last month , on the eve of the congressional budget debate , the New York Times ran as its lead story the results of a poll showing that , by a 67-to-27 percent margin , the public would rather prevent cuts in Medicare than balance the budget . The paper called it a blow to the Republicans ' budget plan . But a Newsweek poll a few weeks later that referred to a " limit " on future Medicare spending , as opposed to " cuts , " and that also mentioned the Republicans ' plan to cut taxes , found only 51-to-41 percent opposition to the Republican budget plan . <p> The order in which questions are asked can skew the results just as much as the wording , especially given the increasing propensity of pollsters to use what are known in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legitimate polling technique to explore the depth or subtleties of people 's views ; for example , a person who expresses initial support for the North American Free Trade Agreement might be asked a series of questions that add additional information , sometimes quite loaded , to see if that alters the person 's views . <p> Campaigns use such questions to probe for hot buttons they can exploit . But sometimes they also release results of post-push questions as if they were a " clean ballot . " That is , after asking a series of questions about Candidate X 's bizarre sexual and financial habits ( " As you are aware , Candidate X was arrested three times last year in a compromising position with a goat ; do you believe this is a matter of public concern or a decision best left to the goat ? " ) , the respondent is asked whom he will vote for . One tip-off to look for in campaign press releases is the phrase , " after being informed of the candidate 's views and experience ... . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have one or not . Pollsters have long known that people tend to offer conventional opinions more than unconventional ones , socially acceptable opinions rather than disreputable ones and any opinion instead of admitting ignorance . In one famous study , a third of people surveyed offered an opinion about a nonexistent " Public Affairs Act . " People routinely overreport their intention to vote , underreport drug use and offer opinions on things about which they have no opinions . <p> The problem is only getting worse as pollsters increasingly ask people for their views on matters they are unlikely to have opinions about , could not have opinions about or arguably should not have opinions about  --  as when Time asked people how serious they thought Ronald Reagan 's colon cancer was or Gallup asked people if they thought the bloody glove would or would not have originally fit O.J. Simpson . <p> Many polls commissioned these days by queasy politicians ask people how they would feel if the politician did X or Y or Z. " All the polling now is predictive polling , " says Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California at San Diego . " A standard piece of methodology today is to ask , How much would this bother you ? ' " <p> The problem is that most people simply do n't know . Hypothetical questions yield hypothetical answers . People are asked in depth about subjects they have not thought much about  --  like NAFTA , or arms control , or environmental regulation . " If you do a 20-minute poll on environmental issues , you 're engaging most people in a longer conversation than they 've ever had about the environment in their lives , " says one pollster . <p> In one recent study , people were asked , " How concerned are you ? " about a variety of food safety issues ; they were offered a choice of saying they were " very concerned , " " somewhat concerned , " " a little concerned " or " not concerned . " But as the study 's researchers noted , asking " How concerned are you ... ? " implies that one is supposed to be concerned . They then did another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question was preceded with a " filter " question that asked , " Are you concerned about X , or do you feel it 's really not a problem ? " The " not concerned " response rate doubled in every case in which the filter question was used . <p> Self-fulfilling prophecies . This problem of " nonattitudes , " as Ohio State 's Asher calls it , is probably the worst bugaboo of modern polling . It also is the most pernicious . Polls routinely overstate public concerns . Indeed the very act of polling , and the increasing tendency of the press and television to report poll results as news , can create self-fulfilling but ultimately ephemeral trends in public " opinion . " In January 1989 , 19 percent of people surveyed cited drugs as the country 's most serious problem . As stories about the drug problem  --  accompanied by poll after poll on the subject  --  flooded in , the proportion hit 53 percent by October . By 1990 it was back down to 16 percent . <p> Politicians are basing fundamental political decisions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but bilge . Even were they accurate in assessing true , heartfelt public opinion , public opinion is not the same as the difficult questions of governance , which always involve trade-offs . " Polls will tell you that promising to deliver more than you can , more than is logically possible , is popular , " says Popkin . <p> One leading Republican polling firm has become so fed up with candidates who ca n't decide anything without taking a poll first that " it has changed the way we look for candidates , " says one of the firm 's executives . " One of the things we now ask them is , what is your philosophy of governance ? If they ca n't tell us , we 'll look for someone else . You do n't want someone who is going to be jerked back and forth by public opinion . " <p> When the overuse of polls reaches the point that even pollsters are concerned , you know we 've got a problem . WHO 'S ASKING ? <p> On sensitive issues , people tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers may depend on the gender or race of the interviewer . <p> Abortion is " a private matter that should be left to the woman to decide without government intervention . " TABLE <p> Source Eagleton Institute survey <p> The problems faced by blacks were " brought on by blacks themselves . " TABLE <p> Source : ABC News/Washington Post poll COMPARED WITH WHAT ? <p> The way questions are phrased , the possible answers that are offered and the order in which comparisons are made can have profound effects on people 's answers . <p> " Would you say that traffic contributes more or less to air pollution than industry ?
