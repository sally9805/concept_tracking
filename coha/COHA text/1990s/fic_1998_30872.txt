THE BRASSIERE I came to New York to find myself and get a fresh start . I was also , to be honest , running away from some messy business that occurred at the Pretty Brook Country Day School in Princeton , New Jersey . I had been a respected English teacher there for four years , ever since graduating from college . My downfall was a brassiere . I came upon it in the deserted teacher 's lounge after school one day late in the spring of 1992 . Its white strap was hanging out of the large gym bag of one of my colleagues , a Ms. Jefferies , whom I found attractive , though that 's more or less incidental to the case . She was the assistant tennis coach , and I imagined that she must have changed into a sports bra of some type and that she was out practicing with the girls . So I saw that strap dangling out of the bag like a snake and I was alarmed . I decided to be virtuous and ignore the strap . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grade some essays , which had been my original intention . We all had our own little desks in the lounge for doing work and after laboring over three or four poor samples of seventh-grade grammar , I forgot entirely about the brassiere . I did become thirsty though , and I walked over to the watercooler to get a drink . Without realizing it , my path took me right alongside Ms. Jefferies ' gym bag and there , miraculously , the strap of that bra hooked itself into the cuff of my khaki pants and the bra was yanked out like a magician 's handkerchief . I felt only a slight tug , like a bite , saw a flash of white out of the corner of my eye , realized it was the bra , and my first impulse was to look to the door . No one was coming ! Then I stared d she looked down  --  how could she fail to notice  --  and saw my protuberance pressing up and to the left ( pointing north to New York ? to my heart ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundly than the wild look of sex that must have been in my eyes . To Mrs. Marsh 's credit she discreetly left the room without saying another word . I took the bra off and I wondered if it was sturdy enough to act as a noose . I could take it to the men 's room and hang myself . I knew my career at Pretty Brook was over . The publicity of my erection had sealed my fate . I bravely stayed on for the remainder of the spring term , but I was n't asked back for the fall . I was let go supposedly because of budget cuts and declining enrollment , but I knew the real reason why the budget could no longer sustain me . I spent most of the summer depressed and ashamed . I had liked teaching . I had enjoyed pretending that I was a professor and dressing like one , even though I only taught the seventh grade . But I was afraid to apply for other teaching jobs . I feared that Pretty Brook would give me a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we suspect that he 's a transvestite . " I had a little money saved up , but it was n't going to last me long as I had my college loans to pay . I was eligible for unemployment , but that was n't going to start until the fall , nor was it a solution . In my nervousness about my future , I took to walking the beautiful and elegant tree-lined streets of Princeton . I often marched up and down Nassau Street , the main drag , though I made sure to avoid the window of Edith 's Lingerie Shop . I frequently saw former students during my walks and their happy greetings would initially che er me up and then further depress me . But overall , walking in Princeton was a very good thing  --  it 's quite a civilized and genteel community . There 's nothing else like it in New Jersey , or even perhaps the rest of the United States . It has both an English feeling to it and a Southern feeling . There are grand colonial mansions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clotheslines waving like international flags ; and then , of course , Princeton University , peering down upon everything from its eerie Gothic towers , and resting regally behind its gates like Buckingham Palace . In the center of town , off Nassau Street , there 's a charming grassy lawn with old trees and flowers and many benches . It 's called Palmer Square and it rests between the attractive art deco post office and the century-old hotel , the Nassau Inn . The benches of Palmer Square were often my destination when I would exhaust myself from my daily marches . Because of my act of spontaneous , self-destructive bra-wearing , which had cost me a beloved position , I thought of myself as unwell and imbalanced . Also I had started reading Thomas Mann 's The Magic Mountain and I overidentified with the main character , a profoundly confused young man , Hans Castorp , who takes a seven-year tubercular cure in the Swiss Alps even though he 's perfectly healthy . So I began to think of my walks as a form of cure and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coat . And I started to view all of Princeton as a gigantic sanitarium and considered the other Palmer Square bench-sitters to be fellow patients , which in fact was true . For some reason , Princeton has attracted a number of halfway houses that cat er to various mental disorders , and many of the residents gravitate towards Palmer Square . So we all sat on the benches , holding on , in differing states of desperation . Two of the regulars on the benches were old professors who had lost their minds , but I admired how elegantly they still managed to dress . And along with those of us who were having mental problems there were quite a few pensioners , men and women , and they were n't crazy , but they were mad with loneliness . A few of them were dangerous to speak with : the only way to disengage was to suddenly stand up , say good-bye politely , and then walk away while they were in mid-sentence . As a result , I only had passing acquaintances with these bench colleagues  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have fallen into that category was a student at the Princeton Theological Seminary , Paul , who had left town a few months before to take up a Presbyterian ministry in Adelaide , Australia . So my only solace , besides walking , was drinking iced coffee and reading as much as possible . Then one day in late August I was sitting on my favorite bench in front of the post office and I was stupefied by the central Jersey heat and atmosphere , whose degree of moisture in summertime can be Amazonian in content . I had made matters worse by parading around like a vain fool in my graystriped seersucker jacket , which you can wear in summer in most climates , like in the Swiss Alps or even the South of France , but not in Mercer County . I had sadly finished The Magic Mountain and I was now carrying around Henry James 's Washington Square but I was too devastated to do any reading . My copy was an old paperback and on the cover was a watercolor painting of the Washington Arch viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover in a state of depression and dehydration , when I suddenly had an inspiration as to what I should do : Move to New York City and live ! A simple plan unfolded : Find a cheap room and gain employment . Since I had been an English major at Rutgers , in the honors program , I thought I 'd look into the magazine and publishing worlds for a job . But the first step was to find a room , a base of operations . I thought that the romantic thing to do was to live in a hotel . I liked to imagine that I was a young gentleman , and so the idea of having a friendly hotel clerk who took messages for me , and said goodbye to me every morning as I headed out in my jacket and tie , appealed to me . The next day I took the train into New York . I used The Village Voice classified section as my guide and I sought out the hotels that advertised under the heading " Furnished Rooms for Rent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I was quite capable of making my way around Manhattan . I grew up in northern New Jersey , just fifty miles from the George Washington Bridge , and I had been coming to the city for museums and plays and odd quests my whole life . But until that moment when I looked at the Henry James cover , I had never really thought of living in New York . My earliest memories of the city are of how it appeared from the top of the Ramapo Mountains , at whose base my hometown , Ramapo , is located . The Ramapos are n't a very impressive mountain range  --  in other states they would be considered large hills  --  but as a child I thought they were beautiful , and from them you could see New York . During the day , only the tops of t he buildings were visible : they rose out of gray mist and pollution . And at night , my father sometimes took my mother and me to a peak of one of the Ramapos , on a road called Skyline Drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's the city ! " He was proud that he had moved from Brooklyn to a place with such a view , almost as if he himself had discovered it . And it was spectacular . You could see the buildings as they were defined by the light around them . They looked like rocket ships to me , and the whole city shone like a crown , like a faraway Oz . So in some ways I had never let go of my initial awe and fear of New York , this feeling that it was n't a real place where a person , where I , could live . But having lost my job at Pretty Brook , and armed with a pleasant fantasy about being a **26;65;TOOLONG , I put my old fear away and I went to hotels all over Manhattan . I unfortunately discovered that a **32;93;TOOLONG no longer stays in hotels . Even the least expensive places cost five hundred dollars a month and the rooms they offered were squalid and depressing . The beds were collapsing and stained , all the windows looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bathroom with everyone else on your hall . And the other residents , whom I caught glimpses of , looked like crack or heroin addicts . I spoke to only one person , a young woman . She was leaving the Riverview Hotel on Jane Street in the Village just as I was climbing the stairs . She was carrying a guitar case , and I thought to myself , " Maybe this is where artists live . This could be good . " I decided to be gregarious and I said to her , with a smile , " Excuse me , I 'm from out of town , and I was wondering , is this an all right place ? " She gave me the most frightened look and upon closer inspection I saw that her hair was filthy and clotted and that there were violet pools beneath her eyes . She fled past me down the stairs and I imagined , in that brief moment , that she was a folksinger who had fallen upon hard times . I watched her walk quickly up the sidewalk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its side and that it carried no instrument . I had n't expected beautiful accommodations , but the environments in these hotels were much worse than what I had imagined , and the clerks were not at all what I had hoped for . There was no chance that they would take an interest in my life and wish me well in the mornings when I left for work . They all dealt with me from behind bulletproof sheets of glass , and even with the speaking holes I found it difficult to understand what they were saying . At the finish of this first day of starting a new life , I ended up in a Greek diner . I had a cup of coffee and I felt the despair return that had been with me all summer . My life was obviously a mess and I thought myself a fool for having pursued a clearly outdated notion of how one might live in New York . I wanted to give up , but I did n't have many options left in Princeton , so I reopened my crumpled Village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " section , but everything seemed far too expensive . And then under " Roommates Wanted " there was an ad that caught my eye . It read as follows : " Writer looking for responsible male to share apartment . Do n't call before noon . Can call after midnight . $210/month. 555-3264 . " It was odd , it gave an old-fashioned phone exchange , but it was also the cheapest listing i n the whole Village Voice , and the idea of a writer was romantic to me . I was enthused again and immediately called the number from a pay phone in the diner . " H. Harrison , " answered an older man 's voice . " I 'm calling about the room  --  " " Can you pay the rent ? " " Yes , I think so . " " What type of work do you do ? " " I teach  --  " " Can you come right now ? I do n't want to talk on the phone . I ca n't stand all these calls . " His phone manner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been inquiring about the room . I told him I 'd come see him immediately . He gave me the address and I jotted it on a napkin . It seemed like incredibly good luck that I should have caught him in . He lived on the Upper East Side and his full name was Henry Harrison . I told him that I was Louis Ives . We said goodbye , I paid for my coffee , and I rushed out of the diner with a feeling of great expectation . This Henry Harrison had sounded very promising . THERE 'S TO BE NO FORNICATION I took a Number 6 uptown and I looked at myself in the train 's darkened window . My hair , which had begun to thin , looked thick in the window 's black reflection , and this buoyed my confidence and added to my good feeling . I got off at the Ninety-sixth Street station and I walked down the hill from Lexington to Second Avenue . It was early evening , still light out , and the air was pleasant . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ninety-third , between Second and First avenues . It was an old five-story brick walk-up  --  there were about a dozen walk-ups on the street  --  and in the little vestibule I buzzed the appropriate buzzer . Out of the intercom came his voice ; he was obvious ly shouting : " YOU 'RE THE TEACHER ? " I shouted back into the speaker , " Yes , it 's me ! " He then buzzed the door open and even as I climbed the first set of stairs the sound of the lock clicking followed me . He was making sure that I was able to get in . The apartment was on the fourth floor and despite all my walking in Princeton I was a little winded . But I was also energized . I was nervous and my heart was pounding . I felt like an actor going on an audition . I wanted that room ! It had to be the cheapest in New York . I knocked at the door . I heard some shuffling . Then the door opened and with a small breeze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw him . It was a strong , mixed odor : unwashed shirts and sweet cologne ; a smell of salt and a smell of sugar . Then I saw him . There was the immediate impression of both beauty and decay , like an elegant room whose high ceiling is yellowed and chipping off . He was old , somewhere in his late sixties was my immediate guess , but his face was still strikingly handsome . He had a good-looking nose . It was straight and appealing and the tip was in fine shape  --  no mottling or holes . His hair was dark brown , too dark it seemed , but it was thick , thicker than mine , and it was swept straight back like a 1930s movie star . He had a confident chin and he was clean-shaven , but he had missed an obvious portion of grayish moustache directly under the nose . And there was something about the deep lines around his mouth and the wild , curious look in his dark eyes that was reminiscent of an old street bum lit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come in , come in , " he said , and he closed the door behind me . He offered me his hand and we shook an d we reintroduced ourselves to get through those first awkward moments . " Harrison , Henry . Henry Harrison , " he said . " Louis . Louis Ives , " I answered and our hands let go . He was n't a tall man . He stood around five feet nine inches , and he was wearing a frayed blue blazer , a pair of stained tan pants , and a button-down red shirt . The collar of the shirt , on the lefthand side , had escaped the lapel of the blazer and was pointing out like a red dart . I was in practically the same outfit , blazer and khaki pants , except all my clothing was in much better shape . But I did n't judge him for the rattiness of his attire : I immediately deferred to his age , and I was more concerted and pleased , that he see that I was dressed in a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , waving his hand before us . " It 's horrible , but it has a certain ambience and mad gaiety . " We were standing in the apartment 's small kitchen . It was cluttered and dusty and poorly lit by a flower-shaped ceiling fixture . The kitchen table was actually a door resting on two filing cabinets . To my right , protruding from the wall , was a very large dish cabinet . On top of the cabinet was an old steamer trunk , and on top of that were several valises piled to the ceiling . I liked the trunk ; it made me think of ocean crossings . And in the corner of the kitchen was a silver New Year 's Eve balloon . It was wrinkled like an old fruit , but it was still floating and must have been considered the source of the mad gaiety . The kitchen 's left wall had a large picture window and through this window the apartment 's living room was visible . " Let me show you the room , " he said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to bother with the interview . " There was a serpentine little path that one could walk along amidst the clutter of the kitchen ( wine bottles , kitchen chairs held together by wire , a stationary bicycle , a metal golf-bag carrier , books , and newspapers ) , and Mr. Harrison took this path and led me to a doorway on the right . The path was made from strips of stained orange carpet of at least two different shades . The floor underneath was an old dark wood , which I thought was attractive for a New York apartment , though the wood did appear to be rotting . As I followed Mr. Harrison , I picked up his salty , sweet odor  --  it pervaded the whole apartment actually  --  and I liked it . It smelled alive . In about four paces we crossed the kitchen and entered the next room . " These would be your chambers , " he said . " I 'm afraid it 's not very beautiful . " His voice lowered , he seemed momentarily embarrassed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence , and said , " But it 's difficult to find good staff to keep things in shape . " " I think it 's perfectly fine , " I said , which was n't the truth , but was the polite thing to say . It was a tiny , narrow room and the bed was a gray mattress on a metal frame with wheels . One of the back wheels was missing and so the shortened leg was propped up on the indented cover of in old book . The bed took up almost the whole length of the room ; there was just enough space for the orange path which I could see led to the bathroom . Beside the bed was a little night table with a reading lamp and next to that was a standing closet whose plywood sides were split open . " You can keep your clothes in that armoire , " he said . " And anything else can go into the file cabinets in the kitchen . " There was a window in the room , but it looked onto an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You can really hear the pigeons , " I said . " Yes , " he said , " It 's nice to have access to nature . " We followed the orange path and went into the narrow bathroom . It was filthy and off-putting . There was a patch of worn blue carpet on the floor , and a set of shelves painted blue to match the carpet . On the shelves were dozens of ointments and toiletries . Most of them were squeezed out and ancient . On the top shelf there was an artistic arrangement , like the seating of a Greek theater , of tiny , dust-covered shampoo bottles bearing the crests and imprints of various hotels . The bathroom was lacking a sink ; there was only a shower and a toilet . Above the toilet was a framed ink drawing of a Victorian woman holding a fan in front of her face . " Do you brush your teeth in the kitchen sink ? " I asked . " Yes , " he said . " When I remember to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it functioned and it made a great enginelike noise . He apologized for it by saying , " It works , but I think there is an outboard motor in there . It likes to pretend that it is a yacht heading out to sea . The plumber may have stolen it from a boat in Long Island  --  that 's where he lives . " He then led me out of the bathroom through the bedroom , across the kitchen , and into the living room , all in about ten paces . It was the largest room in the apartment and it was here that the orange path came to a glorious end  --  the floor was covered with two layers of light orange and brown-orange carpet . This was the ocean of orange which the path , like a river , bled into , and above this ocean were two big windows facing north wit h thick , dirty curtains . The view was a look into the back windows of the buildings on Ninety-Fourth Street , and above the rooftops was the darkening blue of the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Harrison , indicating a narrow couch underneath the wall with the interior window . " But this is also the communal area for communal relaxation . It is barracks-style living here , but it can be done . " Next to his couch-bed was a coffee table that was like a microcosm of the whole apartment  --  it was layered with hundreds of pennies , unopened bills , loose aspirin , a glass wine goblet , and a bowl filled with Christmas balls which managed to gleam through their dust . There were two matching wooden chairs with cushioned seats . He sat on the one in the right-hand corner and I sat on the chair near his bed . " Now we 're supposed to talk , " he said . " See if we 're compatible ... What 's your name again ? It was something with a V. Eaves ? " " Ives , " I said . " Louis Ives . " " Sounds English . But you look German . Are you German ? " " No ... well my father 's side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a lie , but it was sort of a lie . It is one of the peculiarities of my life that while I am one hundred percent Jewish and feel very Jewish on the inside , my outer appearance is very Aryan . I have blond hair , blue eyes , I am almost six feet tall , and my build is slender , but reasonably athletic . My nose comes close to giving me away , but most people look at my hair and naturally assume that my nose is aquiline or Roman , when really it 's Jewish . I was afraid that Mr. Harrison might not like Jews and so that 's why I misled him about Austria . The truth is my father 's side did come from the pre-World War I A ustrian-Hungarian empire , though that does n't account for my blondness . My father 's family , and my father , were extremely dark . My lightness comes from my mother and my mother 's side , which was Russian-Jewish , specifically from a shtetl near Odessa where light-eyed Jews must not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison , because claiming Austrian heritage was a better cover , I thought , and I felt more desirable as a roommate if I were viewed as an Aryan . It is a weakness of my character that I always think to hide my Jewish identity . " They must have changed the names to Ives at Ellis Island , " he said . " The usual immigrant story , " I said , though I did n't tell him that the original name had been Ivetsky . " Austrian , " he mused , and then he smiled at me and said , " You may be a lost Hapsburg prince . " " I do n't think so , " I said , though I took his remark as a compliment . " One can always hope , " he said . " You may have royal blood and a vast fortune you are not even aware of , " and then he slipped out of his usual accent , which sounded almost English but was actually a well-enunciated , clipped American , a Mid-Atlantic accent , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " But until then you are forced to look for shelter with the likes of me . " I smiled at him shyly . He was a great eccentric and I felt cowed in his presence . I wanted to amuse and impress him , but I could only think of polite and pleasant things to say . " Where are you living now ? " he asked . " New Jersey , " I said . " Why are you coming to New York ? " " I was teaching for several years , but I 'm hoping to do something new ... I 'm sort of looking for myself . " I thought he might appreciate such a sentiment sin ce his ad said he was a writer . " You wo n't find yourself in New York . New Jersey much better for things like that . Much less depraved . " I was n't sure how to respond to this remark about depravity , and then I noticed that above Mr. Harrison 's head there was a painting of the Virgin Mary on a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joking , I 'm not really looking for myself I just want a new career . " " Why do n't you want to teach anymore ? " he asked . " There were budget problems at my school and I was junior faculty and so they let me go . " I was lying as honestly as I could . " I see it as a chance to try something new . " " Where were you teaching ? " " In Princeton . " " Princeton ? ! ? " " Not at the university , at a private school called Pretty Brook . I only taught seventh grade . Though I did go for walks at the university and I used the library . " " How is Princeton these days ? My uncle went there . It was great once . But then they let women in . That 's destroyed it , I 'm sure , turned it into a Midwestern U. " " It 's still all excellent university , " I argued . " There 's no reason why women should n't go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he proclaimed . " It numbs their senses , their instinctual drives . It affects their performance in the boudoir and hampers their cooking ability . " " Do you really believe that ? " He was too eccentric , I thought , too crazy . How could I live with him ? But despite myself , I found him charming and I wanted him to like me . " Yes , " he answered . " Women should n't be educated . They 're becoming a nuisance . Taking jobs , thinking they 're equal . They are clearly inferior in all respects ... They do make good mothers and good cooks . The women I like best are the ones in Williamsburg . The Hasidic women . They seem to have the right touch . They wear gingham gowns like Mary Pickford . But I do n't like the men 's costumes at all . It 's not very attractive to wear your hair in pigtails , and the black hats are n't very good . They should get rid of the hats . " I was relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't seem likely that he could be an anti-Semite and like Hasidic women . It made me feel that I perhaps could move in after all . I would n't have to hide my identity and that would make things a lot easier . Still , the place was a filthy mess , even at its low price , and I had been raised in an overly hygienic way by my mother . I kept our conversation going , but I steered it back to more neutral territory , away front the Hasids , should he suddenly say something disparaging and anti-Semitic and make me feel uncomfortable . I said , " Well , the Princeton University campus is still very beautiful . " " I remember my uncle took me there during one of his reunions , " he said . " he was in Fitzgerald 's class . He said he could have written This Side of Paradise just because he was there at the same time . My uncle was an idiot . " " Do you like Fitzgerald ? " I asked . Fitzgerald had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of his short stories that I thought a young gentleman should live in a hotel . " Of course , " he said . " His prose is like cocktail music . But there wo n't be any more Fitzgeralds . You need an all-male environment ... the Muslims might produce a Fitzgerald . They 're good at separating the sexes . " I imagined for a moment a new type of The Great Gatsby , written in Arabic , and being translated , and making a great sensation over here . I s aid to Mr. Harrison , " I love Fitzgerald 's writing . In fact , what caught my eye about your ad was that it said you 're a writer . What type of writing do you do ? " " I 'm a playwright . " " Are you working on anything now ? " " I am trying to finish my chef-d'oeuvre . It is a sexual comedy about the Shakers . Do you know who the Shakers are ? " " I 'm familiar with the Quakers . And I think I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they did n't believe in sex . They believed in shaking . Though every now and then they are revived , only to die out again . They 're like a play . They die out and then they come back . It will be a comic Hamlet . A play within a play . " Since sex was brought up I thought I should ask an obvious question . I had the hope that if I moved to New York that I might fall in love , another Fitzgerald notion , and that could mean sleeping with a woman . I said somewhat bashfully , and as discreetly as possible , " If I did move in here , could I have guests ? " " You mean overnight guests ? " " Yes . " " No ! Absolutely not . The place is too small . There 's to be no fornication ! I would n't even conceive of having sex in here , " and then his voice trailed off , and his eyes looked down , away from mine , " I 'm retired from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I did n't mean to be rude . " I was ashamed and I glanced at the Virgin above his head . Also hanging on the walls were antique picture frames . They held no paintings ; they only framed the off-pink color of the walls . " The Church , you know , is trying very hard to stop people from having sex , " he said . " If they gave up all hell would break loose . Some resistance is needed . People need to be told not to have sex . If you make it difficult most people quit and develop other interests . Like mah-jongg . You 'll find I 'm to the right of the pope on most of these issues . " I kept thinking that he was perhaps of a state of mind beyond eccentric , but there was also this constant underpinning of irony to everything he said which seemed to clearly indicate intelligence and sanity . He was conscious that he was outrageous , but he was also stating his honest beliefs . I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favor , so after he mentioned the pope , I said , " I like that painting of the Virgin Mary very much . " " Oh , yes , I found it in a garage sale in New Jersey . The people of New Jersey are virtuous . All the good people went there and all the lost ones went to Long Island . The government of New Jersey is a mess , but the people are good . You used to be able to go over there and register a car without having insurance . New Jersey was a godsend . You could do anything . We need a state like that again . " " I 've been in New Jersey almost all my life . I was raised there , " I said . " That 's the best reference you could possibly give . " Two of my usual insecurities were soothed : he was attracted to Hasidic women and he was fond of New Jersey . I 'm always afraid people wo n't like me because I 'm Jewish , especially people like Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strange apartment , had the air of the upper class and of England . And regarding my New Jersey heritage , my fear of state bias is almost worse than my fear of anti-Semitism . People of all social classes tend to look down upon you when you mention that you are from the Garden State . But on both these fronts I felt very good about how our i nterview was going . I decided to repay Mr. Harrison for his liberal feelings about Jews and New Jersey with another compliment . " I like your empty picture frames , " I said . " It 's very interesting . " " Most frames are more beautiful than their pictures , " he said . " And less expensive . " After that we briefly discussed money . As advertised , he was renting the room for two hundred and ten dollars a month , plus an additional forty for electricity , the basic phone charge , and for cable television . It was perfectly reasonable and was actually one hundred dollars less than what I was paying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two of frugal living and for making loan payments , while I looked for a job . So the money was perfect , but I did n't know if I could really live in such close , dirty quarters . My feeling was that I probably could n't . We ended our interview with both of us playing our cards close to the chest . He said , " Let 's both think about it and talk tomorrow . " " Yes , that sounds good , " I said , and I gave him my number . While he wrote it down I asked , " Have you seen many other people ? " " Dozens . But you are the only one from New Jersey , and you speak English . " We both stood up . My eye , for a moment , caught hold of the Christmas balls on the coffee table and I remarked , making my final compliment " I like your Christmas balls . " " I love them , " he said . " Do n't you think they 're beautiful ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . If you ever want to give me something you can give me Christmas balls . Of course what I 'd really like is a bowl of jewels . The Queen has jewels . " He showed me to the door ; we walked along the orange path . He opened the door and I stepped into th e hall . " Good-bye , " I said , and I reached out my hand to shake his . I was n't sure if I 'd ever see him again . His eyes suddenly grew more intense and alive . He had been tiring a little by the end of our talk , or was getting bored , but now he seemed almost passionate . He took my forearm in both his hands , squeezed it , and said in German , " Auf Wiedersehen ! " It startled me and he smiled and closed the door .

I transformed my fluorescently lit New Jersey Transit car into a small French berth . The ruined land between New York and Newark became the farms outside of Paris . It was n't 1992 , it was 1922 . I stared out the window . I was a reflective young gentleman traveling alone ; my emotions were still damaged by the War . I was a romantic figure . Then the conductor came along in his dark blue uniform and his standard-issue black shoes , and my fantasy changed . He had a nice , blushing Irish face and it was n't Europe anymore , it was New York in the 1930s . He asked me for my ticket and as I handed it to him I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great civility , " What time will we be arriving in Princeton ? " He smiled and said , " Nine-fifty , " and moved on to the next passenger . I imagined and hoped that he was thinking , " There 's a young gentleman headed back to Princeton after a long day in New York . He probably had dinner at his club . " I did in fact have a long day and I fell asleep with my head leaning against the plastic window . My last vision was of a brilliant orange flame emanating from the tip of an Edison refinery that looked like the Eiffel Tower , even though I had n't switched back my fantasy . I awoke with a start , afraid that I had missed my stop and would land in Trenton . But some interior alarm had gone off and I had come to just outside of Princeton Junction . I then took the Dinky , the small train that connects Princeton Junction to Princeton Borough . It 's only a five-minute passage and has the feeling of a ferry ride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Jersey . The Dinky lets you off at the base of the Princeton University campus , which is situated on the top of a long , sloping hill . One has to walk up through the campus to get to Nassau Street and the center of town . As I stepped off the Dinky I was struck by the beautiful quiet of Princeton . In New York there is a constant throb and grinding that you do n't fully hear until you remember it when you are somewhere silent . I started across the campus and I appreciated anew the cultivated order of the university : the sloping lawns , the rows of dark old trees , the ruled , slate paths , the sculptures of tigers , and the Gothic dormitories made from Italian granite . It had a cold beauty . I stopped and sat on a bench . There was a tiny bit of moon casting a diffused silver light . It was late August and there was no one around ; I had the whole school to myself . There was a slight breeze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was preserving itself , sleeping , until it woke up for the arrival of the students . I felt a great , peaceful remove . I thought of Mr. Harrison and our discussion of Fitzgerald . This is paradise , I thought . And was it like paradise , I wondered , because when you are expelled you always want to return ? I thought of how Fitzgerald died in Los Angeles reading the Princeton football scores . It made me think I should n't leave Princeton . I wondered if I should get a job in the library . I could pretend I was an undergraduate for the rest of my life . I left the bench and climbed the stairs of Blair arch and I saw a gargoyle in the stones , which I had never noticed before , though I had tried to be very observant of all the hundreds of Princeton gargoyles . But gargoyles are like that , you see them when they have meaning for you , and this one 's face was contorted with lust . Sex . It was always my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought of my erection at Pretty Brook . I thought of the brassiere . I still wanted to wear it . I wished I had stolen it and taken it home with me . I reached my little studio apartment on my quiet street , Park Place , and I washed my hands and face to comfort myself . I looked around my neat little room . I was n't the most disciplined housekeeper , but the surfaces were clean . " This is my home , " I thought , " this is where I belong . " It struck me as almost perverse that I had been let into a stranger 's dirty apartment that day , that I had looked at a gray mattress and had even considered for a moment making that bed my new home . Mr. Harrison was certainly eccentric and interesting , but the thought of living with him w as crazy , irrational . I then thought of all the dirty hotels I had looked at , the people standing in the shadows of the hallways like wraiths . I thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mangled me . The whole day felt like a hallucination . I sat in my favorite chair . New York was receding from my mind as a possibility for my new life . It was too dirty , too difficult . I was too soft ; Princeton had spoiled me with its quiet streets . I was at the starting point all over again . I thought of the train conductor who had so nicely taken my ticket  --  should I try and join New Jersey Transit ? The post office ? The police department ? I liked jobs with costumes , but I knew that I was unfit for any of those trades . My thoughts were ridiculous and desperate . I was a young man without much hope . Then the phone rang . " Hello , " I answered with a defeated voice . " Hello . Hello . H. Harrison . " It was him . I could n't believe he was calling . He and New York had already started feeling like a dream . " Oh , hello , " I managed to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we should do it . I did n't want to bother waiting until tomorrow . We should settle it now . We can take it a week at a time . Sixty-two dollars a week . And then if you do n't like it you wo n't have lost a whole month 's rent . " There was a rush to his voice , a desperation . " I 'm not sure , " I said . I was caught off-guard . But I did n't want to say no immediately and hurt him , reject him . " I think we 'd get along fine , and you only have to try it for a week , " he said . " We can even make it per diem . Nine . No , eight dollars a day  --  " " I 'll do it , " I blurted out suddenly . " I 'll give it a try . " What moments before had been out of the question w as now the path I had leaped upon . I changed my life without a moment 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he wanted me . I was responding to that . I was flattered . I wanted to be wanted . " This will be very good for you , " he said , and he sounded happy . " There 's much I can teach you about New York , you know . I can advance you socially . " His voice was confident again , regal . " That would be very nice of you , " I said . My heart was pounding . I think we both felt giddy . His wanting me and my accepting of his wanting had both of us rejoicing . I gushed to him , perhaps revealing too much , " It 's really very strange that I 'll be moving to New York . It 's all because I was looking at the cover of Henry James 's Washington Square and I thought I should be in New York . " " I ca n't stand James ! " he proclaimed . " He 's unreadable . " " I know what you mean . " I was worried that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for myself and James a little bit by saying , " But the earlier books are quite good , like Daisy Miller , or Washington Square . " " Yes , that 's true , his style did change . I wonder why . He burned himself , you know . Sat on a stove and shriveled his testicles . That may account for the change in style . " He laughed and I laughed with him . But it was hard to know what to expect from him . The issue of sex was unclear . I was n't sure if he was heterosexual , homosexual , or if he was some kind of bawdy puritan . But this uncertainty did n't bother me . I found it intriguing and familiar . I told him that I would need a little time to tie things up in Princeton and that I 'd move in as close to the first of September as possible . This was suitable to him and we rang off . &lt; I did n't give my Park Place landlord sufficient notice , but he returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily , but I felt drawn to New York and to Henry Harrison . It was my perception that Mr. Harrison was a gentleman and that I was a fledgling gentleman , and so we would be well-suited for one another . I had been acting like a novice gentleman for almost six years . It started in my sophomore year at Rutgers when I began to address myself in my thoughts as the " young gentleman . " And I think its precise beginning was after I read W. Somerset Maugham 's The Razor 's Edge and Evelyn Waugh 's Brideshead Revisited in too close a succession . Then there followed Fitzgerald and Wodehouse and Wilde and Mann , and I came to only want to read books about young gentlemen . For me they were like Don Quixote 's books of chivalry . I tried to live as the young gentlemen lived . I wrote thank you notes and I enjoyed train travel . I shaved daily , ate solitary meals , and dressed neatly . I used the authors themselves as models : I attempted to dress like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore sneakers , favored pants with texture  --  linen , wool , or corduroy  --  and went to Italian barbers for short haircuts . So I developed a style , a manner of living . It was a fantasy that I wore like armor to get me through the day and to enjoy the day . It made loneliness feel like a movie . A typical Saturday in Princeton sounded like this in my mind : " The young gentleman strolls up Nassau Street . He wears his blue blazer . He goes to his favorite restaurant , the Annex , for his luncheon . He sits at his bachelor table and reads the paper while he eats . He is kindly to the anc ient waitresses . For his digestion the young gentleman strolls some more . He stops at Micawber 's Bookstore , greets the hardworking proprietor , and browses . He is one of the legions who browse and rarely buy , but the proprietorappreciates the young gentleman  --  his dignified manner , his wearing of a tie . The young gentleman walks to Palmer Square and sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desire his company . The young gentleman smiles , but remains aloof . He watches the packs of young girls get ice cream at Thomas Sweet 's . He sniffs the air as they walk past him , hoping to catch a hint of young perspiration . Helooks at their sugary mouths , their thin legs and arms , their ice-cream cones . He wants to run home and hide in bed .... He 's nothing but an onanist ! " Unfortunately , I was always dissolving into overly lonesome thoughts , which turned sexual out of desperation , but that sample day illustrates very well the young gentleman 's life . The idea was to establish a routine ; routines were romantic . Young and old gentlemen had them . You went about your routines quietly , but people took notice and admired you . I wanted them to be able to count on me appearing at the Annex on Saturdays . It was like being a force of nature : a robin redbreast who returns to the same tree every spring ; a young gentleman in a blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had done a good tour of duty in Princeton : people did n't know me , but they would miss me . And now I wanted to go live with Henry Harrison . He was a fellow gentleman . He wanted to advance me socially . I did n't really think he could advance me , but the fact that he said such a thing inspired me . I had been living as a gentleman all by myself , but now I could do it in the company of someone who understood . As I packed up my life in Princeton , I began to think of him as some future vision of myself and I was n't repelled by the future  --  I wanted to know more .
