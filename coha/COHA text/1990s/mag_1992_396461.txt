Patience is a virtue  --  and one that hunters need lots of when their first calls do n't bring that gobbler high-stepping in . As I crept into the pine grove well before dawn , I already knew that the spot held gobblers . I 'd roosted the birds the evening before , so I was sure that two , maybe three toms were now perched within 100 yards of my setup . I waited , savoring the possibilities , knowing full well that when you 're after wild turkeys , possibilities are often the only thing left to hold on to at the end of the day . When the first gobble echoed through the woods , I gripped my shotgun tighter . Just maybe this would be the kind of hunt that all those guys on the videos seem to have  --  the kind where gobblers almost run hunters over in their eagerness to get to the calling . Usually , though , I work hard for my turkeys , and as the minutes passed it looked like this hunt would be no different . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in , no matter how often I called or which calls I used . Finally , a hen moseyed past , heading toward the reluctant gobblers , and as soon as the toms saw her , their reluctance disappeared . They flew off the roost and started gobbling with gusto . But even though they were now on the ground , it did n't help me a bit : From where I was sitting I still could n't see them . I waited in suspense for more than three hours . The first hour was exciting , as gobbles rang out every couple of minutes , often in response to my calls . So I knew that the toms knew where I was . I hoped that once the boss gobbler tired of that particular hen , he 'd be back for the one that would n't come in : me ! But after three hours I was n't so sure . Oh , I 'd hear a gobble every now and then , but when I did it would sound almost indifferent . I stayed where I was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet often had come home with a gobbler , anyway . I was n't about to give up . My patience paid off halfway through the fourth hour . I had n't heard a peep for about 20 minutes , and then just one gobble rang out  --  from a completely different direction from those I 'd been hearing all morning . I eased my shotgun toward the sound just as a tom darted into view , and when the bird moved behind a cedar , I brought the gun to my shoulder . When the gobbler stepped out , I fired . I jumped up to claim my prize and discovered that he was a tom worth waiting for  --  23-1/2 pounds , with a 10-inch beard and 1-1/4-inch spurs . A real trophy . I was lucky in a way . When I first learned to hunt turkeys , patience was n't an option , it was a rule . My husband and I decided to try turkey hunting back in the mid-1960s , when the sport was still a novelty across much of the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting ground , so we were fortunate to find a 400-acre farm to hunt just an hour from our home . We soon discovered that the farmer had very definite ideas about turkey hunting and safety . And I 'm glad he did . The farmer allowed each hunter just 40 or so acres on which to hunt . Each had to stay on his own parcel of land until he either killed a bird or decided to come back to the house . Forty acres is n't a very big chunk of real estate , especially when you 're turkey hunting . But I soon learned that it was big enough , if I had enough patience . At first , with no one to teach me the basics , I was lost in this newfangled sport . Even so , by staying in one spot and making just three yelps on my box call every 20 minutes , I called in a gobbler that very first year . It did n't matter much that he saw me and ran off before I could shoot . I 'd learned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one or two gobbles . By the time I killed my first gobbler I could sit for hours in one spot . And once I 'd bagged my first bird , I began killing turkeys regularly . Patience , I knew , worked . But when we finally bought our own land , I gave in to temptation and ran hog-wild . It was wonderful having the freedom to chase birds anywhere . But when I did , my success rate plummeted . My calling had n't changed , but my patience had . I soon realized that I 'd succeeded previously mainly because of my ability to wait . Most of us live life in the fast lane . One of the pitfalls of this lifestyle is expecting results ... now ! Many of today 's hunting videos contribute to this instant-success mentality . They make turkey hunting look like a snap , but do n't inform their unsuspecting viewers that unless you 're either an outstanding caller , or hunting an area with little competition , turkey hunting can be anything but easy . The key to killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a key that a number of well-known turkey hunters use to consistently bag birds . Experts like Joe Drake of Columbus , Georgia , and Mark Drury of Bloomsdale , Missouri , know the virtues of sitting tight . I hunted with Drake last year in Georgia . Of all the " pros " I 've hunted with , his tactics more closely resemble my own than anyone else 's . " I learned the hard way , " Drake confessed . " Moving too soon and bumping a bird that 's coming in slowly or silently is a common mistake among turkey hunters , even among those who should know better . At times I 've moved when I thought a bird was n't coming in , then called again only to hear the gobbler answer from where I just was . It 's frustrating to sit and wait , but I 've found that patience is one of the most important factors in becoming a successful turkey hunter . " Drake 's not only a top turkey hunter , but he 's also a world-class caller . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one point . That same year he won the friction call division of the Dixie Classic . Nevertheless , Drake rates patience higher than calling ability for consistent turkey hunting success . " When a bird gobbles several times in response to your call , " Drake explained , " he already knows where you are , so it 's time to shut up . Over-calling is a big problem today . Most every hunter in the woods likes to hear himself call , so the birds quickly get call-shy . Hunters who go out early to " practice " calling turkeys are n't doing anyone a favor . It just makes the birds warier and harder to call in . " A double dose of patience is prescribed when you 're after one of these call-shy birds , according to Drake . " Turkey hunting has changed drastically in the last couple of years , " he said . " There are many more hunters in the woods , and all of them are calling  --  a lot ! People say that today 's turkeys do n't gobble as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been fooled before , either before or during the season , so why should they run right in ? Drake has bagged many birds that other hunters have felt were too cagey to kill . Like the bird that was holed up in a burn on some heavily hunted public ground . " One hunter had been working this stubborn old gobbler ever since opening day , " Drake recalled . " A couple of times I tried calling him , too , but did n't even get a response . One day I went by the burn again and did some cutting just to see if the tom would answer . Hens " cut " to demand a gobbler 's attention . It 's a loud , long , insistent call . Anyway , it was late in the morning , and I was surprised when the bird gobbled back . So I eased on into the burn , found a spot to set up , and yelped softly three times . The bird gobbled again from the same spot . I did n't call again for 40 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I did call again , that tom gobbled right behind me . He 'd completely circled me and was so close I could actually hear him running . I turned slowly so I could see him . It was sort of funny when I finally did spot him . With each step , his foot would kick up a puff of soot from the burn . He walked behind a tree , and when he stepped out I killed him . " Drake feels that patience has its place in calling , too . " Each time you call , " he said , " you run the risk of stopping a gobbler and making him strut . This is called " hang-up time " because birds wo n't always gobble when they 're strutting . Hunters who do n't hear constant gobbling may think the bird they were calling has lost interest . But that 's not always true . I 've had gobblers come in just spitting and drumming , making that almost inaudible sound that means they 're puffed out and strutting . If you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range . " Waiting up to 1-1/2 hours for a bird is common , according to Drake . He 's sat as long as three hours waiting for a turkey to show . That 's remarkable when you consider that many top callers will readily leave a gobbling bird if they do n't feel that he 's " hot " enough . Mark Drury is another champion caller who feels that many gobblers are worth the wait . Drury is only 24 years old , but his turkey hunting experience would fill a couple of books . Growing up in prime turkey territory , Drury was an avid hunter by the time he was 14 . He read everything he could on the subject , and now he is one of the top callers in the nation . He is a two-time holder of the Natural Voice World Calling Championships , but he admitted , " Sometimes the best call is no call at all . " Drury is known for persistence . His first longbeard taught him the value of patience . " I 'd been playing " cat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he explained . " I 'd move too soon and he 'd be where I 'd just moved from . Finally , I sat down and waited him out . It took an hour before he finally appeared , but when he did , he was mine . " Patience came in handy this past season , as well . Drury and his brother , Terry , stayed after one gobbler for eight days before Terry finally killed the big 25-1/2-pound turkey . " I feel that being patient is as important as knowing the land you 're hunting , " Drury stated . " Those two factors together account for 75 percent of what it takes to succeed as a turkey hunter . Knowing turkeys ' habits is worth another 15 percent . I really believe that calling only counts for 5 or 10 percent . " I know that I can call , but I kill most of my turkeys by outmaneuvering , outsmarting or out-waiting them . " Out-waiting a gobbler came in handy was hunting a Mississippi hardwood bottom two years ago . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . " On the third afternoon , I asked my friend Randy Panek if he 'd like to come with me . " " We got into the area where I knew the gobbler had been and I yelped with my voice . He did n't answer , so I yelped again . This time the bird gobbled . When Randy and I got closer , we could tell that the bird was n't alone . He was with a whole group of turkeys on the other side of a cane thicket . " A big canebrake is a formidable obstacle that can stop a hunter flat in his tracks . And that 's exactly what this one did . Because Drury and Panek could hear the bird gobbling on the other side of the brake , they sat down where they were to call . " Our calling really got the flock fired up , " Drury said . " Hens started calling , and then the jakes began gobbling . Whenever the jakes gobbled , the boss would gobble , too . We went on for two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we got quiet , so did the turkeys . We were afraid they would leave , so we began to call again . The turkeys got fired up all over again , then everything began to die down . We could tell the flock was beginning to lose interest . We could also hear them starting to move away . " This Mississippi hardwood bottom was big and open with lots of huge trees . A few cane thickets provided cover , but the two hunters knew that if they tried to move around the cane , the turkeys would see them . They had to keep sitting tight like they had for the past three hours . As roosting time approached , Drury realized that this was when the boss would be most vulnerable . He decided to use a " jealousy " tactic and made a couple of jake yelps . That did the trick . The old bird responded immediately , and after hours of stalling , came charging in . Within 30 seconds the cane parted and the hunters could see the gobbler . Panek killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bottom line in all this is that good things come to those who sit tight . If you finally want to get the upper hand on spring gobblers , try using a dose of patience . It 's a key to turkey hunting success that is often underutilized , but one worth its " wait " in toms . You may never run and gun again . <p>
