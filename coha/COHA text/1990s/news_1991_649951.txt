<p> Following is a draft resolution for Congress to consider in response to President Bush 's request for support for the use of force against Iraq . <p> The Congress of the United States <p> RECOGNIZING that its formal approval is indispensable under the Constitution to the deliberate initiation and funding of any long-term , large-scale offensive military operations by U.S. forces ; <p> RECOGNIZING that the long-range national security interests of the United States and the integrity of the United Nations Charter require the complete removal from Kuwait of Iraq 's brutal and illegal army of occupation , with no Kuwaiti territory , resources , assets or other fruits of aggression remaining under the control of Iraq 's dangerous dictator , Saddam Hussein , prior to any resumption of discussions or dispute resolution procedures between Iraq and Kuwait ; <p> RECOGNIZING the need for additional long-term security arrangements in the Persian Gulf and Middle East region , including verifiable limitations on the possession and deployment of nuclear , biological , chemical and conventional weapons and forces , which will require further long-term economic and diplomatic measures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its approval of the President 's actions in defending Saudi Arabia and enlisting United Nations cooperation in the condemnation of Iraq 's invasion and annexation of Kuwait , the sponsorship of economic sanctions to reverse Iraq 's aggression , and the passage of Security Council resolutions authorizing United Nations members to take all necessary measures to secure that objective ; <p> HEREBY authorizes the President as Commander in Chief of the United States armed forces , acting pursuant to such Security Council resolutions and in cooperation with the United Nations and other governments in the coalition against Iraq , to initiate and undertake such military combat operations by air , sea and , to the extent necessary , land as may be required to induce or effect the complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait ; <p> PROVIDED that the President publicly certifies in writing to the Congress , with full supporting materials , within 48 hours of initiating such combat operations , all of the following : <p> 1 . That economic sanctions limiting Iraq 's receipt of funds , technology , spare parts and other supplies vital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , time and opportunity to succeed but have no reasonable long-term prospect of successfully inducing an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait on terms acceptable to the coalition ; <p> 2 . That all diplomatic , political and other non-military means of peaceful dispute resolution contemplated by the United Nations Charter , including face-to-face in-depth discussions between the principal parties and utilization of the good offices of the Secretary General of the United Nations , have been exhaustively and constructively attempted but have no reasonable long-term prospect of successfully inducing such withdrawal ; <p> 3 . That the composition of the forces to be sent into combat against Iraq , and the financing of such combat and associated operations , reflect appropriate contributions of military manpower , equipment and funds from other nations in the coalition , in particular <p> ( a ) those nations in the coalition located in that region , including those who have realized enormous windfall profits from the sale of oil since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and those who are on the official United States list of terrorist nations , and <p> ( b ) those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States upon the supply of oil from that region , <p> with the result that United States forces shall represent less than one-half of all forces sent into combat against Iraq , and United States funds shall be required for less than one-half of the costs of such combat operations ; <p> 4 . That the state of combat readiness of U.S. and coalition armed forces in the region , including the adequacy of their numbers , equipment and medical preparations , is clearly sufficient to assure an early and decisive military victory forcing the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait , with United States military casualties no greater than such estimated number as the President shall include in such certification ; and <p> 5 . That the consequences of such combat operations , particularly in terms of immediate bloodshed on both sides and the long-term position of the United States and its allies in the region , have been carefully weighed by the President and are , in his opinion , fully justified . <p> Until the President is prepared to certify to all of the above , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for the initiation or conduct of such combat operations , unless hostilities are precipitated by an attack or the imminent threat of an attack by Iraqi forces upon the forces of the United States or any other nation .
