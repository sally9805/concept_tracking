<p> THANKSGIVING FOR THE PEOPLE <p> Editor  --  Shortly after I arrived ashore , a friend who had been here for some time asked me , " What do you think of this country ? " I did n't know what to say . <p> Since then , I finished my graduate study and got a master 's degree ; I got married and brought up three children ; I worked in the fields I had studied and retired ; I have traveled to many places as business required , or for personal leisure . <p> Now , more than 30 years later , I know what to say , " I am impressed ! " <p> I am impressed by the natural beauty of this land . <p> Moreover , I am impressed by its people . <p> It is the people who have the foresight to preserve the beauty of the land through the national park designation . <p> It is the people who have made the technological advancements manifest in this land . <p> It is the people who have established a democratic system and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the people who have the wonderful idea of setting aside a day in a year to celebrate a feeling , which I have shared for a long time , Thanksgiving . <p> FRANCINE CHOW <p> Moraga <p> . <p> ' I WAS SO HUNGRY ' <p> Editor  --  I can feel the aching , yawning emptiness in my stomach , twisting my innards into knots . It hurts , this starvation , this emptiness of food . It makes me afraid , makes my cheeks sallow , makes my bones show , makes me feel like I am falling into a hole never to see day again . I walk around looking like living death these days , thinking only of food , thinking only how the turkeys used to look on Thanksgiving , of Christmas pies , of gingerbread men , of how I used to have soup on sick days , but now only have emptiness inside my stomach , only see the death and disease-filled streets , only hear the wailing cries of children with nothing to eat , only feel the cold , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children of War . <p> JULIETTE CARR , 11 <p> Malcolm X School <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> OUT-OF-TOUCH POLS <p> Editor  --  The pounding of chests continues , and Newt Gingrich has outlined his Republican " contract " for us Americans , normal and not . Aiming high , Newt intends to amend the Constitution twice next year . <p> First of all , I 've never quite bought into the idea of a balanced budget amendment . It has a nice ring to it , but is it realistic ? Does it actually tackle the problem head-on , or create another ten layers of subcommittees calling meetings to set further meetings ? Moreover , the numbers seem to indicate that an actual " in the black " balanced budget can not be achieved in the near future without breaking the backbone of social services , so who are they fooling ? Are we as a nation willing to sell out our grandparents to balance the spreadsheet ? <p> Yet even more disturbing to me is the idea of a school prayer amendment . Political analysts across the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why is Newt intent to spend our tax dollars pushing it ? To se cure the Religious Right for the 1996 election , perhaps ? <p> As a taxpayer , I 'm left wondering if the politicians of both parties really got the message on November 8 . But even more so , as an American citizen ( who believes in God ) , I 'm asking what ever happened to the founding principle of separation of church and state ? <p> As Newt Gingrich sits before his turkey dinner to give thanks , let 's hope he can remember why the Pilgrims braved the cold Atlantic in the first place  --  to escape a theocracy out of touch with its citizens . <p> ROBERT KINSEY <p> Walnut Creek <p> . <p> REINVENT DEMOCRATS <p> Editor  --  Clinton 's embrace of the GOP " contract " finally and fully exposes him as the conservative front man for Big Business that he has always been . Who would be surprised if he , too , defected to the Republican Party ? It is the only way for him to be re- elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what has he done except to drum up Republican votes for the GATT , with its destructive impact on American workers and on the global environment ? <p> It is time for progressives to reinvent the Democratic Party so that it truly represents the needs , interests and wishes of workers , families , and the poor , that is to say , the vast majority of Americans . And if the Democratic Party can not be reformed , then we should organize a new one . We need a voice , not an echo ! <p> Dump Clinton and Gore . <p> GERALD CAVANAUGH <p> Alameda <p> . <p> SCHOOL PRAYER AMENDMENT <p> Editor  --  There 's an obvious solution to the issue of school prayer for those congressmen who feel that school kids should pray publicly and that this will solve America 's moral value problems . <p> When Congress writes the amendment to the Bill of Rights , have it mandate the following schedule : <p> On Mondays , the Protestant churches get to write the public , nation-wide prayer . Start with one of the Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go on through the alphabet . Tuesdays , the prayer would be Catholic . Again , this would rotate through Roman Catholic , Greek Orthodox , and the various other groups calling themselves Catholic . Wednesdays would be the days for various Jewish groups , and Thursdays would be the province of Muslims , Sikhs , Taoists , followers of Confucius , and various other Middle East and Oriental beliefs . And , to round out the picture , Fridays would belong to New Age religions , and all others . <p> That way nobody gets left out . No matter which faith is the " correct " belief , it 'll be included . <p> MICKEY STRANG <p> McKinleyville ( Humboldt County ) <p> . <p> TEACHING MORAL VALUES <p> Editor  --  The Chronicle is entirely correct in editorializing on November 18 that public school prayer is inherently coercive . The fundamental problem , however , is that all of the values imposed on students in compulsory public schools are coercive , forcing them to stick to the trite and the superficial . <p> At the higher education level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the G.I. Bill of Rights and Pell Grants that allow families to choose schools that offer spiritually-based education . When we have school choice at the K-12 level as well , and all families have the same freedom to select schools that teach enduring moral values that richer families have always enjoyed , we will start to reverse the ethical decline and fraying of the social contract that this country has suffered . <p> ALAN BONSTEEL <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> GIVE A COP A CHANCE <p> Editor  --  If Mayor Frank Jordan and any of the Board of Supervisors do not think we need new weapons and equipment , they are wrong ! In officer Jim Guelff 's case , they are dead wrong ! <p> We are totally outgunned and ill-equipped to handle the increased frequency of these crazed gunman scenarios , and the city must commit the fiscal resources to protect the citizenry and give the cop on the street a chance of surviving the next such encounter . <p> It is time the mayor and all city government come to the grim reality that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next 101 California , or Pine and Franklin streets , is in fact out there waiting to happen . <p> Officer DAVID P. HERMAN <p> Police Officers ' Association <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> CHIEF RIBERA RESPONDS <p> Editor  --  In a November 21 letter , David Weitzman of Berkeley criticizes the police for brutally beating Robert Pinckney . Mr. Weitzman is quick to jump to conclusions on what happened . Our officers are protected by the same Constitution that protects Mr. Weitzman and Mr. Pinckney  --  there is a presumption of innocence . I have ordered a comprehensive investigation into the incident , and appropriate action will be taken if the charges are substantiated . In the meantime , the heroic deeds of our officers should not be unnoticed . <p> ANTHONY D. RIBERA <p> Police Chief <p> San Francisco
