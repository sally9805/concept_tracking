A CONNECTING FLIGHT FOR DELTA AND CONTINENTAL ? <P> Things are going so well for Delta and Continental airlines , No. 3 and No. 5 in the industry , respectively , that they are talking about merging to become No. 1 . Then , presumably , they could really kick some tails . An acquisition of Continental , twice bankrupt and now en route to record earnings , by once struggling Delta would create a giant with more than $18 billion in revenues . But the consolidation could reduce competition . " I see the Justice Department digging in their heels and not allowing this acquisition to go through , " says Michael Bradley , a finance professor at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University . <P> A merger could spur copycat deals as competitors rush to keep up . Delta , in fact , has been squawking over plans by American Airlines to merge its transatlantic operations with British Airways . Delta , it seems , does n't want too much airline capacity in the hands of anyone else . <P> UPDATE : THE CORPORATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in prison for his starring role in the $3.4 billion collapse of Lincoln Savings &; Loan , the poster boy for the 1980s S &L; scandals that cost taxpayers nearly $500 billion was still able to thumb his nose at prosecutors last week . <P> A U.S. District judge in Los Angeles tossed out Keating 's 1993 conviction  --  and 12 1/2-year sentence  --  for fraud . The judge , whose ruling could lead to a retrial , said several jurors were prejudiced by knowledge of Keating 's 1991 conviction on similar charges in a California state court . That verdict vaporized too : a federal appeals court overturned it last April on grounds that Judge Lance Ito ( of O.J. fame ) had given jurors improper instructions . <P> All of which could be heartening to three disgraced executives of the Archer Daniels Midland Co. who were charged with price fixing last week . Under indictment are Michael Andreas , who is the son of chairman Dwayne Andreas and on leave as executive vice president of ADM ; Terrance Wilson , who ran the company 's corn-processing division ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitacre was the mole at meetings in which price fixing was allegedly discussed , his work did not shield him from charges . It did no doubt figure in ADM 's admission of guilt and payment of a $100 million penalty in October for conspiring to fix the price of the feed additive lysine . Whitacre has stopped cooperating with the FBI , leaving the government with plenty of videotape but no chief witness . <P> FIDELITY 'S FICKLE YEAR CONTINUES <P> Stars keep falling out of the firmament at Fidelity Investments , the Boston-based mutual-fund giant . Last week Brian Posner , the highly regarded manager of the popular Equity Income II Fund , left to join E.M . Warburg Pincus and Co. , a much smaller New York house . Posner 's departure is troubling for Fidelity because he was the post-cowboy model the firm has been promoting to restore confidence among investors ; each of Fidelity 's 15 biggest funds was trailing the S &P; 500 at the end of November . Posner , 35 , has been steady and successful since he took over the Equity Income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown from $2.1 billion to $14.8 billion for a 16.9% annual return , fifth among 60 similar funds . <P> A COURSE IN HOW TO MAKE SOME BUCKS
