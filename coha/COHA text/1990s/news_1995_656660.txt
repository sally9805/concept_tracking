<p> WHEN Disneyland Paris opened in April 1992 , French intellectuals moaned that it would be a " cultural Chernobyl . " <p> But the world did n't listen . Led by Disney , American-style theme parks keep coming on line . Local entrepreneurs are fighting back , buying know-how and adding their own comic characters and cultural trappings . <p> No matter what continent they 're built on , thrill rides keep producing bigger goose bumps and whiter knuckles . But the goal now is grander : to provide entire fantasy worlds . And the growing prosperity of many regions , such as Asia , makes spending on leisure more possible . <p> The new parks come with their own twists . Brazil 's entries have ecology themes . In China , retired Red Army brass bang the drum for a park based on Mao 's 1930s Long March . Israel 's economics minister is trying to interest Jordan and the Palestinians in a Dead Sea park , " The Lowest Park on Earth .

Mickey <p> THE feisty Gallic comic book hero Asterix is fighting it out with Mickey Mouse . To everyone 's astonishment , the battle is turning out to be a draw . <p> France has hardly proved to be fertile ground for amusement parks . After the Walt Disney Company announced plans in 1985 to build EuroDisney , some 40 other theme-park projects were on the drawing boards . The vast majority stayed there . <p> After some tough times , EuroDisney is expected Nov. 15 to announce its first profit ever for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 .

In the past two years Disneyland Paris , as the resort is now called , cut ticket prices by 20 percent and introduced the popular new ride Space Mountain . It is now France 's biggest attraction , drawing more visitors than the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre . <p> But two French amusement parks - Park Asterix and Futuroscope - are also setting attendance records . Asterix offers live shows and street theater , as well as re-creations of Asterix 's comic-book village and a Roman city . The Rue de Paris evokes 1,000 years of French history from the Middle Ages to modern times . <p> The park , which unlike Disneyland Paris closes for five months each winter , drew 1.8 million visitors this year . ( Nearly 11 million people are expected to visit Mickey in France this year . ) Almost unknown in the US , the Asterix comic books , created in 1959 by Albert Uderzo and Rene Goscinny , have sold 200 million copies and been translated into 57 languages and dialects . The park recreates the world of Asterix , who in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of wild adventures in part because of his naivete . <p> Futuroscope near Poitiers in central France takes the visitor into the 21st century , a century the park 's creators say will be dominated by images . Indeed , images are everywhere at Futuroscope : They fill a 1,740-square-foot wall composed of 850 screens . They ride on a " magic carpet " underneath the visitor . They can be seen on an interactive screen that allows the viewer to participate in a game by answering questions during the film . <p> Futuroscope , which opened in 1988 , expects almost 3 million visitors in 1995 . <p> - Eduardo Cue in Paris <p> In Brazil , it 's the ecology <p> ' BRAZIL and China are the two theme park hot spots on the planet , " says Dennis Speigel , director of International Theme Park Services in Cincinnati and a consultant for five Chinese and two Brazilian projects .

It is scheduled to open in late 1997 and is expected to attract 4 million visitors a year with a combination of American high-tech rides and Brazilian themes . Instead of Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck , tourists will meet Iara , Princess of the Waters , and her companion , Pira , a pink porpoise who patrols the park 's lakes and rivers against polluters . <p> Ecology will also be the main theme of the $ 200 million Serra Azul ( Blue Mountain ) theme park , scheduled to open in early 1998 some 30 miles from the nation 's largest city of Sao Paulo .

" Theme parks are in a veritable arms race because each one needs to have bragging rights to the newest , most creative , or wildest thing going , just to stay in the ball game , " Mr. Ruben says . Some 260 million Americans visited theme parks last year , reflecting growth that has stayed at 3 to 4 percent a year since 1980 . <p> To turn that around , America 's executors of escapism continue to adapt the latest technologies . Those include flight simulators to mimic actual flying , such as in Universal 's " Back to the Future " ride where riders sit in 1950s autos to ride from suburban skies to the center of the earth . And they include " virtual reality " devices , attractions where participants don Medusa-like headsets to enter and explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a growing challenge from casinos . " Gambling casinos have flattened the theme-park business in the West and could do it elsewhere , " says Harrison " Buzz " Price , a financial analyst who tracks the theme-park industry . He notes that the number of casino visits by Americans has tripled since 1990 , adding $ 40 billion just last year - compared with $ 7.5 billion spent at America 's theme parks . <p> " For $ 600 million , you can build a pretty alluring full-scale resort where dad can play roulette while the kiddies ride coasters , " Ruben says . <p> - Daniel B.

The cost ? $ 25 million . The reason ? " To show I can make dreams come true , " he says . The village epitomizes a particularly Japanese sort of theme park - a place where culture of a different time or place is shrunk , sanitized , and turned into a walk-through cliche . <p> Japan 's most successful and best-known park is Tokyo Disneyland , which is n't much different from its forebears , but the country is peppered with " villages " devoted to British , Dutch , German , Russian , Spanish , and other cultures . There are also parks devoted to the Meiji and Edo periods of Japanese history . <p> Aside from being a dream made real , Mt . Rushmore Jr . is clearly an attempt to bring in more customers . The park has had hard times because of Japan 's four-year-old recession . The market for amusement is oversupplied : The country went through a theme-park boom shortly after Tokyo Disneyland opened in 1984 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . One of Japan 's most successful , Tobu World Square , a short drive from Western Village , is a collection of replicas of some of civilization 's most notable encounters with building materials .

" They featured likae Thai dancing , nang shadow puppets , spicy food , elephant rides , and local beauty contests . " <p> Today , Thailand 's amusement park industry has become Western-oriented , powered by the nation 's nearly double-digit economic growth over the past 10 years . Thailand 's three principal amusement parks , Magicland , Dreamworld , and Siam Park City , are privately owned and remain in the control of their founding families . <p> Meanwhile , new outlandishly large shopping malls have incorporated mini-amusement parks that aim especially to attract young people . <p> Magicland , founded in 1975 , is the oldest amusement park in Thailand .

Whatever Thais borrow from the West will always become a Thai adaptation . " <p> - Tony Gillotte in Bangkok
