We all have a couple we idealize . For some it 's Burns and Allen , for others it 's Tracy and Hepburn , and for yet others it 's Siegfried and Roy . For me it was Howard and Alison Stern . I became infatuated with their marriage in sixth grade , listening to Stern 's local radio show after school . Here was a guy who was married but getting away with spanking strippers . As an 11-year-old I did n't know much about marriage , but if it included spanking strippers , I was ready to take my vows . <P> I knew more about the Stern marriage than my parents '  --  since I listened to him for four hours a day and really could n't take more than about seven minutes of my parents . This may be because they rarely mentioned spanking , which , according to Dr. Spock , was actually a good thing . I was so enthralled with Howard , I even went with my father to see him perform at a New Jersey nightclub called Club Bene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to the Sterns as role models . <P> Through Howard , I had learned not only about fidelity but also that the key to a stable , long-term relationship is to publish the personal details of your life while simultaneously using your job as an excuse to meet loose women . So when the Sterns announced that they were separating after 21 years of marriage , my entire relationship philosophy was shaken . I had blindly assumed that just because it was working for an immature , oversexed Jewish man with bad hair , it would work for someone like me too . But now I had to question that . You see , sometimes my girlfriend , like Alison , gets mad about what I do for a living . This usually happens when I write about my attraction to Pamela Anderson Lee . Or when I find myself " assigned " yet another story about porn stars , supermodels or roller-derby queens . Or when I claim that I do n't get any dates and am actually a very , very lonely man . <P> But now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think that maybe all this public self-revelation , while promoting honesty and openness , is n't such a good game plan for a relationship . This became clearer as I realized most couples do n't leave the Jerry Springer Show with a lot of issue resolution . <P> This summer , sitting at L.A. 's babe-filled Sky Bar , I was looking at an older , married guy on a business trip who was wistfully scoping out the action . I asked my two friends , both of whom had girlfriends , if they thought we 'd wind up like him , as sexually stunted as Stanley Kubrick must have been when he directed Eyes Wide Shut . " By the time I 'm his age , you know what I 'll be thinking about ? " one of them asked , staring at a hot but annoyingly giggly blond . " Pie . A nice piece of pie . Even right now if you offered me her or an entire Cookie Puss , I 'm not sure which I 'd pick . " My other friend and I nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puss was some sort of ice-cream cake . Then we made fun of him . <P> But I want to be a pie guy . On Monday , when asked if he 's going to date strippers , Howard , who had promised to have sex with every floozy he ever met the moment his wife died , said , " Obviously , I 'm not the type who goes out with bimbos . " On Wednesday , he did n't show up for work . Spanking , it seems , is less fun when temptation is replaced by reality .
