Petr Taborsky does n't fit the part of a hardened convict . Born into a Czech family that immigrated to the U.S. when he was six , he is articulate and soft-spoken , an idealistic 34-year-old science nerd who hopes someday to conduct cancer research . He is also principled and somewhat stubborn  --  so stubborn , in fact , that the state of Florida put him on a chain gang last year , and now holds him in a minimum-security facility . <P> His crime ? In a case with widespread implications for universities increasingly dependent on corporate research grants , he was jailed for " stealing " his own notebooks and ideas and then refusing a judge 's orders not to exploit them . He is fighting for what he believes are the intellectual property rights of thousands of faculty members and graduate students . <P> Taborsky 's Kafka-like ordeal began in 1987 , when as a student at the University of South Florida , he took an $8.50-an-hour lab-assistant job to help pay his tuition . He was assigned to a $20,000 project contracted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to determine if bacteria can be used to extract ammonia from clinoptilolite , a clay used in filtering water . The clay , similar to Kitty Litter , absorbs ammonia from water and can be cleaned and used over and over . <P> Unfortunately , the clay also absorbs calcium , and in the cleaning process used by the power company , the calcium forms a sludge that clogs the machinery . If bacteria were used for the cleanup , the company reasoned , only the ammonia would be extracted , and the problem would be solved . <P> It soon became apparent , however , that the bacterial approach would n't work , and the project was terminated . Taborsky 's supervisor , Professor Robert Carnahan , assigned him to menial jobs in the lab and , because the Florida Progress grant had terminated , began paying him from other budgets . <P> Still , Taborsky remained intrigued by the clinoptilolite challenge and continued tinkering with the clay after hours  --  eventually stumbling onto what he thought might be the answer . Ever inquisitive , he had been heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its absorption diminished with increasing temperatures . One day , while looking at his graphs , he discovered that above 1,500 degrees F the clinoptilolite starts rejecting calcium . <P> At that temperature , Taborsky concluded , the small pockets in the clay that absorb calcium close down while the ones that accept ammonia remain open . By spring 1988 , he had gathered enough data to make his case to Carnahan and a Florida Progress representative , who told him that his idea could be " worth millions . " <P> And what might his share be ? Taborsky asked . " Nothing , " said Carnahan , explaining that under terms of the Florida Progress contract , the process he had developed belonged to the company . But Carnahan proposed a consolation prize . If Taborsky would voluntarily turn the rights of his discovery over to Florida Progress , the company would offer him a staff job .
