Once close to becoming America 's first woman astronaut , Jerrie Cobb is still campaigning for her day in space Photograph Space tests for women were halted , but " I do n't cry over spilt milk , " says Cobb . This " tilt table " test to detect heart defects was among the dozens Cobb passed . // Later this month , when space pioneer John Glenn , 77 , is scheduled to board a space shuttle and return to orbit after an earthbound hiatus of 36 years , pilot Jerrie Cobb plans to be watching from the perimeter of NASA 's Cape Canaveral . As she gazes into the Florida sky , Cobb , 67 , will ponder a question she has asked herself countless times : What would it be like to be in Glenn 's seat ? Cobb once came tantalizingly close to finding out . Back in the early ' ' 60s , she was among 13 female flyers picked to undergo privately funded tests conducted by a NASA-affiliated doctor to determine whether women had the right stuff to join the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test group , whom newspapers dubbed potential " astronettes . " But her dreams of streaking beyond the sky were dashed in the summer of 1962 when expert witnesses ( including Glenn ) urged Congress not to send the women into space , since none had served , as the male astronauts had , as military test pilots . " After that , " says Cobb , noting that the U.S. had no female military test pilots at the time , " we did n't have a chance . " That is , until now . Cobb , who has worked for the past 35 years as a missionary pilot in the South American jungle , returned to Washington , D.C. , recently to push her new quest to become the oldest woman in space . " You ca n't give up a dream that you feel is really your destiny , " she says . Doubters beware : Jerrie Cobb has spent her life breaking barriers . Born in Norman , Okla. , during the depths of the Depression , she and her family wandered from one base to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , served in the Army . A childhood lisp made Jerrie ( short for Geraldyn ) self-conscious at school , but by first grade she had discovered horseback riding , which made her feel free . " There were no fences , " she recalls of the scrubby flatland near her home at the time , in Abilene , Texas , " and you could just race and run as fast as you wanted . " For six years , riding bareback was Cobb 's passion , until her father learned to fly the Waco bi-wing opencockpit plane he bought while trying to become an Army Air Corps flyer . William never won his wings , but his 12-year-old daughter was captivated by her first 90minute flight . " After that , horses did n't stand a chance , " she says . Jerrie spent her free time that summer waiting in a cornfield outside Wichita Falls , Texas , for her father to show up after work . " I 'd make sure the plane was all gassed and oiled and waxed , " she says , " so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . " Cobb earned her civilian pilot 's license on her 16th birthday and was cleared to fly commercial aircraft two years later . Yet , except for an early gig dropping publicity flyers for a circus , she found that a woman pilot could n't get work . She once drove 1,400 miles in her Pontiac to apply for a pilot 's position with a Miami-based airline but was told to apply down the hall as a stewardess . Finally , in 1952 , she was hired by former Air Force pilot Jack Ford , who had a government contract to fly surplus military aircraft to U.S. allies overseas . " Ford was n't looking for women , " says Cobb , " but he was hard up for pilots , so he hired me . " Photograph Cobb ( in 1960 ) thrives on " the freedom you have in the air . " // He also fell in love . Ford and Cobb were rarely together- " He 'd be off somewhere , and I 'd be on the other side of the world , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jamaica in 1953 , he proposed and she accepted . But their engagement ended in tragedy two years later when Ford 's plane caught fire and exploded after taking off from Honolulu . He died instantly . Heartbroken , Cobb returned to the Southwest to be near her family , then struck a deal with an Oklahoma City aircraft manufacturer that hired her as a test pilot . Within four years the soft-spoken aviatrix had broken four world records for altitude , distance and speed . She had also attracted the attention of W. Randolph Lovelace , then chairman of NASA 's Mercuryproject life sciences committee . In 1959 he invited Cobb to his Albuquerque lab to undergo the same physical tests used to pick the first generation of astronauts . Cobb passed with flying colors and was asked by Lovelace to recruit a dozen other potential women astronauts . When the tests were called off in 1962 , Cobb flew to Washington to plead her case with Vice President Lyndon Johnson and Congress-but she could n't change the prevailing opinion that a woman 's place was not in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Colombia , where she offered her services as a bush pilot to a Catholic bishop in the Amazon , ferrying supplies to the region 's indigenous people and living in their palm-thatched communal huts . Cobb was flying over the Amazon one night in 1969 when she learned over her radio that Neil Armstrong had walked on the moon . She later celebrated by dancing on the plane 's wing in the moonlight . ( " I wanted to share this great news with some villagers , " she wrote in her 1997 autobiography Solo Pilot . " But they were n't very impressed . They said one of their shamans used to fly to the moon all the time . " ) After Glenn , an old friend , announced plans to orbit the earth again , Cobb decided to come back to the U.S. She had learned that Donald Dorough , an instructor at Fresno Pacific University in California , had mounted a letter-writing campaign to get her aboard a future space mission-an effort that seems to be gaining momentum . On Sept. 26 , NASA Administrator Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cobb booster , that if Glenn 's mission produces useful data on aging , there is a possibility NASA will send up another senior citizen . According to Inhofe , NASA 's Goldin said that " there is no one in America who is more qualified and deserving to be in that space shuttle than Jerrie Cobb . " Cobb could n't agree more . " I 'd love to be on my way to Houston to train , " she says . And if that day ever arrives , she will be one step closer to realizing the ambition that has sustained her for years . " This means everything to her , " says Cobb 's sister Carolyn Warren Lawrence , 70 . " This is her lifelong dream . " Photograph Cobb and fellow astronaut hopeful Jane Hart testified at 1962 Congressional hearings on women in space . " I have a whole other family in the jungle , and they could n't be nicer , " says Cobb of her work in the Amazon .
