WASHINGTON IS N'T THE KIND OF TOWN that likes to be told what to do . Its greatest recent failure was President Clinton 's health care plan , which was handled by the White House as if it were the commandments from Sinai . Its model for success was the 1986 overhaul of the federal income tax that was initiated by then-Treasury Secretary Donald Regan with the following words : " This thing is written on a word processor . It can be changed . " Almost nobody is betting that the $368.5 billion agreement to restructure the U.S. tobacco industry will go up in smoke ; all sides have too much to gain for that . But if history is any guide , its details , announced with such hoopla last month , are merely a starting point and not the done deal . That 's bad news for Big Tobacco . As sure as the Marlboro Man is a cowboy , transforming the settlement into a statute will take longer , involve more changes , and probably cost more money than any of its framers imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exercise is beginning to look like a very long session in a torture chamber from which it might not be able to escape . After all , who in official Washington is going to defend the makers of cancer sticks ? So far , no one has . As a result , the agreement is shaping up more as a floor than a ceiling for industry concessions . The basic accord is a simple trade : The tobacco companies get immunity from class-action lawsuits and a limit on damage claims in exchange for the biggest political payoff ever , the equivalent of a 75-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes . But neither the U.S. government nor anti-tobacco activists will be satisfied with that . For the next several months , the cigarette makers and to a lesser extent the trial lawyers and even the do-gooder attorneys general who brokered the arrangement will discover that they have opened a massive can of worms , and that some of those critters bite . Here is a handicapping of the obstacles the settlement must overcome if it is to become the law of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton 's approval the pact is dead , and that does n't make the tobacco industry happy . The President is a devout tobacco-phobe and will demand that the companies give back some of the goodies they won at the bargaining table . Judging from Clinton 's brain trust , the givebacks could be substantial ; he will seek advice from the like of David Kessler , the former head of the Food and Drug Administration ; C. Everett Koop , the former Surgeon General ; and Senator Edward Kennedy , one of Congress ' most vocal tobacco critics . It 's already clear that Clinton will insist that the FDA be given more decisive and immediate authority to regulate nicotine . But that 's just for openers . A panel of influential health advocates is pressing for all sorts of changes . Ever the politician , Clinton will hide behind the opinions of as many of these people as he can find . He probably will await the backing of at least Kessler and koop before he feels comfortable enough to keep the process rolling . Congress eill want more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indujstry offers up billionsd they can spend . The attorneys general already secured a share of the loot for their states . Now the feds will bid for tlheirs . Anti-tobacco Congressmen are angling to win extra aid for children 's health programs , anticancer research , and antismoking programs overseas . But the largest additional expenditure will go to tobacco-producing states . Negotiators purposely left tobacco farmers out of the initial settlement , knowing that Southern pols will need a good reason to vote for a plan that whacks an industry so dear to the folks back home . The omission provides tobacco-state lawmakers a chance to fight for-and thus take credit for getting-economic assistance for their farmers , which is an ample excuse to vote " Aye . " Republicans will try to undercut the trial lawyers . If the President blesses a revised package , the Republicans who run Congress will be loath to flatly say no . But they will change the deal where they can to benefit their friends and hurt their enemies . Ironically , Big Tobacco has lavished too much campaign cash on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smoke-filled rooms have never been more out of fashion , especially when black-hat tobacco lobbyists are lighting the cigars . But Republicans can still try to clip one of tobacco 's chief adversaries : the trial lawyers , who also are among the Democratic Party 's sweetest sugar daddies . Watch for the GOP to try to trim the estimated $3.5 billion that is slated to be the lawyers ' take . And watch for the lawyers to claim that none of their fees will come from the settlement ; they will be negotiated directly with the companies . Best of luck selling that one . Do n't expect a resolution soon . Wall Street analysts predict that the deal will be codified by year-end . Think again . " This legislation could be a year , two years , even three years away , " Senator Orrin Hatch , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , told FORTUNE . Most insiders assume the process will stretch well into next year , and they warn that the enterprise faces at least some threat of being stubbed out entirely . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made itself into such a whipping boy that it has no choice but to obediently accept whatever abuse is meted out . In the meantime , every corner of the agreement will be scoured for flaws . The White House has launched a 30-day review from which dozens of problems are likely to surface . One already has : Some economists doubt that raising prices and curbing advertisements will dampen cigarette sales as much as has been promised . Harsher actions and stiffer penalties may be called for . Congress wo n't even begin to consider the pact seriously until the fall , and no one yet knows how the leaders intend to proceed . The best guess : It will be easier to list the committees that do n't claim jurisdiction than to count the ones that do . Lawmakers are expected to examine everything , from the industry 's request to have its payments declared tax deductible to an issue that has been delicately called the brother-in-law problem . Both the President and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott have brothers-in-law who sat in on the settlement talks as trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The one certainty about the coming tobacco wars is that they have only just begun . <p>
