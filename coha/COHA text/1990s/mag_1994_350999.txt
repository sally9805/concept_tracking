Tonya Harding may have missed a crucial triple Axel in Lillehammer , but she managed to execute a flawless triple entendre in Oregon last week . Standing abjectly before Judge Donald Londer , Harding pleaded guilty to hindering investigators ' efforts to unravel the conspiracy behind the Jan. 6 attack on skater Nancy Kerrigan . Then Harding offered the hushed courtroom a single sentence : " I 'd just like to say I 'm really sorry that I interfered . " It was a nice bit of public contrition , but what exactly did it mean ? Was Harding * sorry that that her actions had obstructed the investigation ? Or was she sorry that on that day in Detroit  --  oh , so many medals , tears and lies ago  --  she interfered with Kerrigan 's skating ? Or was she simply sorry that the hearing had inconvenienced the judge , who had rushed back to court from a vacation ? <P> We will probably never know . The event that began with a whack ! has ended with a less-than-satisfying whimper . By plea-bargaining her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never have to answer the question that dogged her all the way to the Olympics and back : Did she have a hand in planning the assault on Kerrigan ? For her part of the bargain , Harding will pay a $100,000 state fine , make a $50,000 donation to the Special Olympics and reimburse the Multnomah County prosecutor 's office for $10,000 in court costs . In addition , she must perform 500 hours of community service , undergo a psychiatric evaluation and spend three years under supervised probation , which restricts her movement to the three West Coast states . Finally , Harding was ordered to quit the U.S. Figure Skating Association and immediately pull out of this week 's World Championships in Japan . <P> The plea bargain surprised and upset many players in the 69-day soap opera . The U.S. Figure Skating Association , which had counted on Harding to head its squad in Japan now that Kerrigan seems to be retiring from amateur sport , hastily tapped national bronze medalist Nicole Bobek to fill the empty slot . That leaves two young skaters with little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic alternate Michelle Kwan , 13  --  to represent the U.S. <P> William Hybl , chairman of the association 's disciplinary board , vowed that the plea bargain would not get in the way of Harding 's hearing , scheduled to begin June 27 . Though the group can no longer impose its harshest penalty  --  Harding has already resigned under duress  --  it can still strip Harding of the national title she earned two days after the assault on Kerrigan . It could also demand a refund of the tens of thousands of dollars the association provided for training . The U.S. Olympic Committee might also demand reimbursement for training expenses and strip Harding of the commemorative items given to her in Lillehammer . There 's even speculation that the committee may strike Harding 's name from the 1994 U.S. Olympic team records  --  as if anyone could forget .
