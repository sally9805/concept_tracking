<p> In the 1880s , fear held back acceptance of electricity . People believed the current was dangerous . Frustrated , Thomas Edison staged a parade in New York . A phalanx of men , wired together , marched through the city wearing lighted electric bulbs on their heads . <p> More than 100 years later , the Internet industry might need a similarly grand , outrageous gesture . Surveys indicate that a wide range of people  --  Internet users and those who have never called up a Web page  --  are afraid of this new technology . And that fear is a major roadblock to the growth of on-line shopping , banking , ticket buying and other Internet transactions . <p> Some are afraid their credit card numbers could be stolen if they order products over the Internet . Others worry that too much personal information can be gathered on the World Wide Web . And there is also a sense that the Internet makes sensitive information  - -  pornography , bomb-making instructions  --  too easily available . <p> In July , word leaked that America Online would sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never mind that magazines , credit card issuers and other entities sell such information all the time . It seemed more dangerous that an Internet company was doing it . AOL was flooded with e-mails and phone calls and buckled under a wave of negative publicity . In a contrite letter , AOL Chief Steve Case told members , " We decided to change our plans . " <p> Why the heightened concern ? In part , it 's the power of the Internet , a medium that can fling information to computers around the globe with the click of an electronic mouse . It 's like fear of flying , says Emily Green , an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge , Mass . " You 're safer in an airplane than in your car , but airline disasters are more dramatic . " <p> Like electricity in the 1880s or automated teller machines in the 1980s , people have a hard time trusting technology that 's new and often incomprehensible . Keep in mind that while the Internet is exploding , only about 10% of the population uses it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more comfortable , " says consultant Chris Meyer at Ernst &; Young . <p> Probably nothing hurts the Internet 's growth more than the fear of using a credit card on the Net . <p> A cautionary tale <p> That fear is fed by tales like the saga of Carlos Felipe Salgado Jr . On May 21 , Salgado went to San Francisco International Airport to seal a lucrative business deal . He was planning to sell a computer disk with more than 100,000 purloined credit card numbers for $ 260,000 in cash . <p> But the buyer turned out to be working with the FBI , and Salgado was arrested on the spot . The 36-year-old resident of Daly City , Calif. , was charged with five counts , including illegally trafficking in credit card account numbers . According to the criminal complaint , Salgado , alias Smak , has acknowledged that he hacked into an Internet service provider and stole the credit card numbers . <p> If any of the cards were used to make purchases  --  and there 's no evidence of unauthorized buying in this case  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time it takes to get a new credit card . Yet , the idea that Salgado could nab 100,000 credit card numbers that way is unnerving . <p> " As long as shoppers think the Internet is not secure , they will stay away in droves , " says Cathy Hotka , vice president of information technology at the National Retail Federation . A recent survey by Nielsen Media Research found that the main reason consumers do n't shop on the Internet is that they do n't trust the payment method . <p> Many experts say such fears are unwarranted . Despite a few high-profile cases , there is no evidence of widespread fraud . And most Web sites use sophisticated encryption methods to shield transactions . <p> " The Internet makes it easier to steal a large amount of account information and credit card numbers at once , " says Bill Burnham , electronic commerce analyst at Piper Jaffray . " But are the risks significantly higher on the Internet than in the physical world ? I would say no . " <p> As Internet proponents like to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card to a waiter or revealing a card number to an operator on the other end of a toll-free phone call . In either case , the chances of the number being intercepted and stolen are higher than typing a credit card number into a secure , established Internet site . <p> " Any time human beings interact with your card , there will be fraud , " says Randall Whiting , CEO of CommerceNet , an electronic commerce advocacy group . " With the Internet , you are probably less at risk because fewer humans see your account number . " <p> To make consumers feel better about Internet commerce , credit card companies are working on technology to keep transactions even more secure . And as offerings on the Net grow , " eventually the convenience , cost savings , and selection will overcome security concerns , " Burnham says . <p> The Internet industry will have a harder time calming fears about privacy . <p> Those fears were heightened in April when the Social Security Administration launched an Internet site . The site offered the same information that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as earnings records and estimated retirement benefits . But once it was on the Internet , it became much easier to obtain . Former spouses , nosy neighbors or marketers might get at the information . Public outrage forced the agency to close the site . <p> Gathering intelligence <p> Other concerns abound . Internet sites can monitor your mouse clicks , so they can tell what Web pages you call up  --  a car ad , an <p> X-rated site , a travel site . About half of the top 100 Internet sites collect such information . <p> Another hot concept is data mining , a method that uses powerful computers to collect information about consumers from a variety of sources , cross-reference it and figure out whether an individual is a likely customer . <p> In Naked in Cyberspace , author Carole Lane begins by saying : " In a few hours , sitting at my computer , beginning with no more than your name and address , I can find out what you do for a living , the names and ages of your spouse and children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your house and how much you pay in taxes on it . I can make a good guess at your income . I can uncover that forgotten drug bust in college . " <p> Scary ? No question . Especially , perhaps , for the 90% of the population that still does n't use the Net . <p> But it 's also the new reality . Companies have been compiling computer databases on people for two decades . <p> " A bit of the privacy fears are overblown , " says Bill Gross of Idealab , which launches small technology companies . " People do n't realize how much phone companies and credit card companies already know and sell about them . " <p> Yet , the industry will have to respond . " Like in any business , if people want privacy , a market will spring up for it , " Gross says . A shopping site might guarantee it wo n't sell your information . Or services might spring up that troll the Net for your name on marketing lists and remove it . The main catch might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay . <p> Blocking porn , not Mars <p> A fear of harmful information on the Internet led Congress to pass the Communications Decency Act to attempt to limit pornography on the Web . The law was struck down by the Supreme Court this summer . <p> But the fears have n't gone away . Many see the Internet as a marketplace without rules , where children who have a computer and a modem can see X-rated material . The market already has responded . Almost all X-rated sites cost money to see , and to pay , you need a credit card . That alone keeps most kids out . <p> Also , a number of companies sell software that filters the Internet . Load it on your computer , and it looks for certain words or other information , blocking sites containing them . <p> Pornography is n't the only concern . Amid news of right-wing militias is often a mention that instructions for building a bomb can be found on the Internet . ( It 's true . ) An editorial about biological warfare in The Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recipes for making biological weapons are even available on the Internet . " ( They are , though much harder to find than those for explosives . ) <p> That kind of readily available information is not likely to go away . It 's a price we 'll pay for having so much other information  --  live photos of Mars from Pathfinder , lists of restaurants in Beijing , articles on every health problem  --  equally easy to find on the Net . <p> The industry 's challenge is to make people feel good about the Internet . Law enforcement may help with part of that task . The FBI already is deep into an effort to clean up the Internet . In a recent speech , FBI Director Louis Freeh said : " Today when new FBI agents graduate from our training academy in Virginia , they leave with their firearms and their badges , but they also leave with a laptop computer . " <p> Of course , that could kindle another debate . <p> TEXT OF GRAPHIC BEGINS HERE <p> Top reasons for not making purchases on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't know how 9.3% Prefer store shopping 9.1% Do n't have credit card 6.9% Privacy issues 6.7% Nothing worth buying 5.1%
