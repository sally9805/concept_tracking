<p> On Christmas Day 1944 , 5-year-old Wanda Jones struck a match in her back yard in San Diego while playing with her new doll . She caught fire and died five days later . <p> Today , her identity lives on - stolen by a middle-aged woman whom California investigators have yet to catch . <p> " I do n't like the idea of anyone running around using her name , " says Wanda 's mother , Syble Lubowicki , 74 . " It kind of desecrates somebody 's memory . " <p> But experts say fraudulent identities are epidemic , and its victims are the living as well as the dead . <p> State and federal investigators say millions of people have fake IDs - illegal but easy to get , tough to trace and costing billions annually in fraud . <p> " These people are all over the country , " says Ray Dudley with the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Texas , who constantly runs into fake IDs among illegal immigrants . " It 's becoming a way of life . " <p> Pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible , Jacob took his brother Esau 's identity to fool their blind father ; Shakespeare used it in everything from Midsummer Night 's Dream to Henry V. <p> But now , fake IDs have gotten so out of hand that government agencies and businesses are trying a host of new , high-tech and , some say , intrusive ways to stop them : <p>  --  The Social Security Administration this month begins verifying Social Security numbers for driver 's license bureaus . So far , 27 states have said they will participate . <p> In the past , the Social Security Administration zealously protected its records , and states only sporadically asked for help . But in 1993 , California asked the agency to verify Social Security numbers for the state 's driver 's license bureaus and the administration decided to start working with all the states to fight fraud . <p> " If we can nip in the bud people ( who are ) fraudulently obtaining driver 's licenses with incorrect Social Security numbers . . . that 's a good place to start , " says Social Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national registry , based on Social Security numbers , that would list all eligible U.S. workers and could be used to verify identities . <p>  --  States are adding holographic images and ghost pictures on driver 's licenses to make them harder to fake . New York 's license has glass beads . Cut into the card and the beads turn black , an easy giveaway . <p> California 's is covered with glimmering holographic images of the state seal . <p> The Texas license features a bar code and magnetic stripe . If there 's a question about identity , anyone from the police to grocery store clerks can scan the information on the back . <p> Banks in Arizona and some in Nevada are fingerprinting non-customers who cash checks , a trend sure to spread as businesses move to protect themselves . <p> But the scope of the fake ID problem - coupled with technological advances available to criminals as well as those trying to stop them - almost defies efforts to control it . <p> " It 's sort of an epidemic , " says Jim Gaughrin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and copiers can turn almost anyone into a fake ID expert . <p> " Before , you had to have a skill level that related to graphics arts , " says Paul Luxion of Advantage Technology , which creates security features for identification cards . " Now , you 're an expert counterfeiter , I 'm an expert counterfeiter . " <p> Adds Los Angeles Detective Ed Lindsey : " It 's growing each day because ( of ) the better computers . " <p> Laws , too , have exacerbated the problem . The 1986 immigration law that required employers to check identification documents of their workers spurred a fake identity boom , says Dudley . <p> In Texas - long a battleground over illegal immigration - the problem is enormous , says Lonnie Rannals , a fraud investigator with the Texas Department of Public Safety . <p> " It does n't make a lot of headlines , day in and day out , because it 's not spectacular , " he says . " But it 's insidious because we all pay for it . " <p> What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine how many fake licenses do exist . Some states ' privacy laws keep the information under wraps ; elsewhere , statewide information is available - but costs millions of dollars to get . <p> So what 's known is piecemeal - and disturbing . <p> In Florida , for example , investigators recorded 2,588 fraudulent driver 's license cases in 1994 , many caught by clerks who spotted fake documents . But when 25,000 people a day pass through the state 's license bureaus , many get away with fraud . <p> " It 's real serious . It 's prevalent , " says Richard Weaver , chief of Florida 's driver 's license field operations . " We catch some - and we do n't catch others . " <p> Nationally , the Inspector General 's office of the Social Security Administration dealt with hundreds of fake Social Security card cases every month in 1994 , and convicted 478 people . That level has continued this year , and the agency is asking to increase its fraud force from 84 to 114 . <p> Who wants a fake ID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The woman who assumed Wanda Jones ' identity has held it for at least five years , authorities say . They 're still looking for her , but the search is made harder because , like many people with fake IDs , they do n't know why she wanted it . <p> Why does someone get a fake ID ? The reasons are as varied as the aliases they assume . <p> Illegals want them so they can get jobs in the U.S. Teens get identification to show they 're old enough to drink . Criminals use them to avoid prosecution for crimes ranging from drunken driving to murder . Parents skip out on child support , spouses evade alimony . Check-kiting , credit card schemes , welfare fraud - all are reasons people want fake ID . <p> " Name me a crime and that person has probably obtained a driver 's license . . . to escape detection " or commit the crime , says California fraud investigator Jack Bartlett . <p> Many people with fake IDs even register to vote and register for the draft to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help flesh out their wallet , " Bartlett says . <p> Not all the identities come from the death rolls , like the Wanda Jones case . Some criminals simply make up aliases and forge documents to fit . Others take the names of the living . <p> Alexandro Gallegos of Chula Vista , Calif. , misplaced his driver 's license and tried to get a new one . <p> " They said , ' No way , ' I 'm not me , " Gallegos says . " My credit is history . I tried to buy a car , they said absolutely not . . . . It 's hell . The bottom line is , I just want to be me again . " <p> One former fake ID ringleader-turned-police informant says he did n't bother using the names of real people . He just made up his own , and hired other people to do the same . <p> " We were driving nice cars and had fine jewelry and were eating at some of the nicest restaurants in town , " says the man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack fake ID rings . <p> The man asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution from his former partners . Police verified his identity and claims . <p> In his heyday , he made $ 300,000 a year and had hundreds of people working for him . After being trained , his workers would create fake birth certificates , buy fake Social Security cards and use them to get licenses . <p> They then would open checking accounts , give banks the addresses of vacant houses and watch the mailboxes . The ring mostly bought computers , televisions and VCRs . They wrote hot checks for the merchandise or used credit lines - then resold the goods on the street . After charging credit lines to the limit , they would use the worthless cards as secondary identification to open new lines of credit at other stores . <p> " It 's real easy , " the informant says . " I 've stayed at some of the nicest hotels , free of charge . " <p> The man decided to become a police informant after being threatened with prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 years probation . <p> Little cases add up to big bill <p> No one knows for sure how much people with fake identities cost the nation in fraud , but the cost is high and rising , says Joe Sanders , head of New York 's driver 's license system . <p> A report in the 1970s on the idea of a national identification system cited losses in the billions because of false identities . Since then the problem has only expanded , he says . <p> " I do n't think anybody can give you an exact figure , " Sanders says , " but it 's certainly in the tens of billions of dollars annually . " <p> Of course , most people using fake IDs do n't make anywhere near the amount of money that the police informant did . But , investigators say , even the little cases add up . <p> Canadian Gerald Gilmore used the identity of Michael Bradley Kunzie - a veteran who died in a car accident - to live in California as a legal resident . He received more than $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught , California 's Bartlett says . <p> Gilmore served a year in prison and was deported to Canada . <p> In Los Angeles County alone , a report shows , a welfare program that requires fingerprints is estimated to have saved $ 14 million in four years . <p> New York City has just begun using a computerized fingerprinting system to combat welfare fraud . <p> Estimates on credit card fraud are harder to come by , ranging from the millions of dollars a year to as much as $ 4 billion . Investigators cite the higher figure ; credit card companies say that the cost is lower . <p> Kenneth Steven John made a good living , though . He used 45 identities and 61 driver 's licenses from six states for at least seven years , and netted more than $ 500,000 from check-kiting and credit card schemes before he was caught in Nevada in January 1994 and then extradited to California . <p> The Secret Service , which often gets involved in white-collar crime that crosses state lines , says John opened credit card accounts , withdrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid detection . <p> John pled guilty to fraud and was sentenced last month to four years in prison . He also was ordered to repay $ 489,891 . He declined comment . <p> Catching some people is easy . One man walked into a Texas driver 's license office with a birth certificate , the word " stillborn " stamped across the page . <p> " Obviously , at that moment we knew we had some falsification taking place , " says Rannals . " When questioned , this applicant said , ' Yes , I am " stillborn , " as if ( to say ) , ' Yes I am still alive . ' " <p> Catching others is much harder . <p> Dollie Fazekas of Florida was stopped 18 times over a span of 21 years for driving while drunk before she was successfully prosecuted and imprisoned for seven years under a career criminal law . <p> Even in a state considered a leader in stopping fraud , it 's tough to nab someone with 14 names , nine Social Security numbers and six birthdates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in prison . The crimes , often financial in nature , are the last to be investigated and the people involved are the first to be released from prison . <p> Usually , says Janice Friedli of the California Department of Motor Vehicles , the crimes are n't " a matter of life and death . " <p> Yet the crimes are costly , and the fake IDs will continue to multiply unless more money is spent to stop the problem , experts say . <p> " There is a whole sub-sector of people who are making themselves very wealthy using fraudulent IDs , " says Friedli . " It 's a frightening problem when you think about how monstrous it is and at the moment , seemingly uncontrollable . " <p> Adds the INS ' Dudley : " We need to get back to when somebody presents you an ID you can believe it . " <p> Contributing : Barbara Pearson
