" Remember on our honeymoon we had that fight because deep down you were scared you 'd married a dull thing ? " <p> In the dark of the car she sat with her nice black coat buttoned up all the way , the one they had bought together last year , going through all those stores . Hard work ; they 'd get thirsty and end up-having a sundae at the place on Waterberry Street , the sullen , young waitress always giving their senior discount even though they never asked ; they had joked about that-how the girl had no idea , as she plunked down their mugs of coffee , that her own arm would someday be sprinkled with age spots , or that cups of coffee had to be planned since blood pressure medicine made you widdle so much , that life picked up speed , and then most of it was gone-made you breathless , really . Oh , this is fun , " his wife said now , gazing through the night at all the houses they passed , lit up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he drove ; his wife contented , her hands folded in her lap . " All these lives , " she said . " All the stories we never know . " And fie smiled further , reaching to touch her mittened hand because he had known she might be thinking that . Her small gold earring caught the light from a street lamp as she turned her head . " Remember on our honeymoon , " she asked , " when you wanted me to care about those old Mayan ruins the way you did , and all I wanted to know was which people on the bus had pom-poms on their shower curtains back home ? And we had that fight , because deep down you were scared you 'd married a dull thing ? Pleasant , but dull . " He said no he did n't remember that at all , and she sighed deeply to let him know she thought he did , pointing , then , to a house on the corner done all in blue lights , strings of blue lights up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep looking . He said , " I 'm mental , Janie . " " Very mental she agreed . " You have the tickets ? " He nodded . " Funny to have tickets in order to get into a church . " In fact , it made sense to move the concert into St. Catherine 's after this latest storm had caused the roof of Symphony Hall to cave in . No one had been hurt , but it made Bob Burgess shudder ; he had an image of sitting in the plush red seats he and Jane , and the roof falling in , the two of them suffocating , their life together ending in that horrible way . He was prove to that sort of thinking these days . He had even had a sense of foreboding coming out tonight , but it was n't something he 'd say ; and she loved seeing all these lights . And she was happy right now , it was true . Jane Burgess shifting slightly inside her nice black coat , was thinking that , after all , life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting older was knowing that so many moments were n't just moments , they were gifts . And how nice , really , that people should celebrate with such earnestness this time of year . No matter what people 's lives might hold , sickness , or alcoholism , or adolescent children ( some of these houses they were passing would have to hold some of these things , Jane knew ) , still and all , people were compelled to celebrate because they knew somehow , in their different ways , that life was a thing to celebrate . He put the blinker on , pulled out onto the avenue . " Well , that was nice , " she said , sitting back . They had fun together these days , they really did . It was as if marriage had been a long , complicated meal , and now there was this lovely dessert . Downtown the cars moved slowly on Main Street , passing by street lamps that had large wreaths hung on their poles , and shop windows and restaurants that were lit up . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the curb and pulled the car over ; it took time , he had to work hard to ease in between the others . Someone from behind them honked with annoyance . " Oh , phooey to you . " Jane made a face through the dark . He straightened the wheels , turned the engine off . " Wait there , Janie , till I come around . " They were n't young anymore , this was the thing . They kept telling each other as though they could n't believe it . But they had each of them in this last year suffered a mild heart attack ; hers first , feeling , she said , as though she had eaten too many of the grilled onions at dinner that night . And then his , months later , not feeling like that at all , more like someone had kicked him in the back , but with his jaw aching the same way Jane 's had . They felt O.K. now . But she was seventy-two and he was seventy-five and unless a roof fell down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living without the other at some point in time . hop windows twinkled with Christmas lights , and the air smelled like snow . He took Jane 's arm and they walked down the street where restaurant windows displayed different arrangements of holly or wreaths , and some window panes had their corners spray-painted white . " The Lydias , " Jane said . " Wave , honey . " " Where ? " " Just wave , honey . Over there . " " There 's no point in my waving if I do n't see who I 'm waving to . " " The Lydias , right there in the steak house . Ages since we 've seen them . " Jane was waving cheerfully , excessively . He saw the couple through the window now , on either side of a white table cloth , and he waved , too . Mrs. Lydia was motioning for them to come in . Bob Burgess put his arm through Jane 's . " I do n't want to , " he said , waving his other hand at the Lydias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mouthing each word with exaggeration , " We 'll see you lay-ter . At the concert ? " Nodding . More waving , they were on their way . " She looks good , " Jane said . " I 'm kind of surprised how good she looks . She must have colored her hair . " " Did you want to go in ? " " No , " said Jane . " I want to look in store windows . It 's nice out here , not too cold . " " Now fill me in , " he said , as they continued walking , thinking of the Lydias , whose name was not actually Lydia , but Granger-Alan and Donna Granger . The daughter , Lydia Granger , had been friends with the middle Burgess girl , and Patty Granger had been friends with the youngest Burgess girl . Bob and Jane referred to the parents of their daughters " friends , even now , by the children 's names . " Lydia 's been divorced a few years now . The guy bit her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . " " Bit her ? Or beat her ? " " Bit . " Jane snapped her teeth together twice . " You know , chomp , chomp . He was a veterinarian , I think . " " Did he bite the kids too ? " " I do n't believe he bit the children . Two children . One of them is hyperactive , ca n't concentrate , whatever it is these days when a kid ca n't sit still . The Lydias wo n't mention it , so do n't bring it up . The woman with the pink hair in the library told me all this . " Let 's go , I want to be able to sit on an aisle . " Ever since her heart attack Jane had been worried about dying in public . She had had her attack in the kitchen of her home , but the idea that she might keel over in front of people made her very anxious . " And I want to sit toward the back , " her husband said . She nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes he had to leave a place in a hurry . The church was dark and cold , and almost empty . They handed over their tickets and were given programs , which they held with a tentativeness while they walked into one of the back pews , settling in , unbuttoning their coats , but leaving them on . " Keep an eye out for the Lydias , " Jane said , turning her head . He held her hand , picked nervously at her fingertips . " Was it Lydia who slept over every weekend for a while there , or was that her sister ? " Bob asked , while Jane craned her neck back , looking up at the ceiling of the church , the large , dark rafters . " That was Patty , her sister . Not as nice a girl as Lydia . " Jane leaned in closer toward her husband and whispered , " Lydia had an abortion in high school , you know . Pretty certain . " " I know , I remember . " " You do ? " Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bob said . " You told me she used to come to your office with cramps . She came in once and cried for two days . " " That 's right , " said Jane , warmer now inside her coat . " Poor thing . I suspected it right then , frankly , and pretty soon after that Becky told me it was true . I 'm really surprised you remember that . " She chewed her lip pensively , rocked her foot up and down a few times . " What ? " Bob said . " You thought I never listened ? I listened , Janie . " But she waved a hand and sighed , settled herself against the back of the pew before she said , musingly , " I liked working there . " And she had . She had liked , especially , the adolescent girls , the young , bumbling , oily  --  skinned , scared girls that either talked too loud , snapped their gum ferociously , or slunk through the corridor with their heads down-she loved them , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her office with their terrible menstrual cramps , lying on the couch gray-faced and dry-lipped with pain . " My father says it 's all in my head , " more than one girl had said , and oh , it broke her heart . What a lonely thing to be a young girl ! She would let them stay sometimes all afternoon . The church was slowly beginning to fill up . Jane , turning her head , saw the Lydias going up the back steps to the balcony . " Oh , there they are , " she said to Bob . " Long time since we 've seen them . Long time , really . She looks pretty good . " He squeezed her hand , and whispered , " So do you . " The members of the orchestra came out in their black clothes and took their seats up front by the pulpit . Music stands were adjusted , legs set at an angle , chins tilted , bows picked up-and then the disharmonious sound of an orchestra warming up . It bothered Jane that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even now , know . It felt indecent , invasive . But people ended up knowing things . When you were a school nurse , or a pink-haired librarian , you ended up knowing who married alcoholics , whose kids had attention deficit disorder ( that 's what it was ) , who threw dishes , who slept on the couch . She did n't want to think there were people in this church right now who knew things about her children that she did n't know herself . She ducked her head toward Bob and said , " I hope there are n't people in this church right now that know things about my kids that I do n't know . " The music started , and he winked one eye at her slowly , reassuringly . During Debussy he fell asleep , his arms folded across his chest . Glancing at her husband , her heart swelled with the music , with love for him , this man next to her , this old ( ! ) man , who had been followed through life by his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his face right now she felt she could see the little boy , furtive , forever scared ; even sleeping here at this very moment there was a tautness of anxiety on his face . A gift , she thought again , placing her mittened hand lightly on his leg , a gift to be able to know someone for so many years . Mrs. Lydia had had her eyes done ; they stared out of her head like a sixteen-year-old 's . " You look wonderful , " Jane told her , although close-up the effect was frightening . " Just wonderful , " she repeated , because it must have been expensive , and probably scary as well . " How 's Lydia ? " she asked . " And the others ? " Lydia 's getting married again , " Mrs. Lydia said , moving aside to let someone get by . " We 're happy about it . " Her husband , squatty , round-shouldered , rolled his eyes and jiggled change in his pocket . " Gets expensive , " he said , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , gave him a fleeting look , which he seemed to ignore . " All those damn psychiatrist bills , " he added , saying this to Bob with a kind of man-toman laugh . " Sure , " said Bob affably . " But tell us , what are your bunny rabbits up to ? " Mrs. Lydia 's lipstick was dark , perfectly in line . And so Jane recited the ages of their grandchildren , described the jobs held by her sons-in-law , the girl they were hoping Tim would marry soon . And because the Lydias only nodded at all of this , without even saying how nice , Jane felt compelled to go on , to fill the space between their close , almost hovering , faces . " Tim went skydiving this year , " she said , and told them how this had scared her to death . It seemed he 'd gotten over it after a few times , he had n't mentioned it again . " But honestly , " Jane said , shivering , hugging her black coat close . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She herself could imagine it only too well , and it made her heart race . " Not really a risk taker , are you , Jane ? " Mrs. Lydia was looking at her with those new eyes ; unnerving to have a sixteenyear-old 's eyes looking at you from an old woman 's head . " No , " said Jane , but she felt indistinctly that she had been insulted , and when Bob 's arm came up to touch her elbow she felt he had received this , for her , in that way , too . " You 've always been a favorite of mine , Janie Burgess , " said the squat , red-faced Mr. Lydia then , abruptly reaching over and rubbing her shoulder through her nice black coat . She felt exhausted , suddenly , by this silliness . What were you supposed to say when a squat , homely little man whose path you had crossed briefly for a number of years said you had always been a favorite of his ? " Do you have any plans to retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Never , " the man answered . " I 'll retire the day I die . " He laughed , and they laughed with him , and in the quick glance he gave to Mrs. Lydia , the way she briefly rolled her brand-new eyes , Jane Burgess realized that he did not want to be home all day with his wife ; that his wife did not want him there either . Mr. Lydia said to Bob , " You 've retired now , since we last saw you ? Was n't it funny , meeting you in the Miami airport the way we did ? " " It 's a small world , " Mrs. Lydia said , tugging at her ear with a gloved hand , glancing at Jane , and then turning her head , looking up the balcony stairs . Bob stepped to the side , ready to go back into the church . " When was this ? " Jane said . " Miami ? " " Couple years ago . We visited those friends we told you about , " Mr. Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's not my dish of ice cream , I can tell you . " He shook his head , then squinted up at Bob . " Does n't it make you crazy to be home all day ? " " Love it , " Bob said firmly . " I love it . " " We do things , " Jane added , as though she needed to explain something . " What things ? " And then Jane hated her , this tall woman with her painted face , the hard eyes staring out from under the red felt hat ; she did n't want to tell Mrs. Lydia how every morning she and Bobby , early , first thing , took a walk , how they came back and made coffee and ate their bran cereal and read the paper to each other . How they planned their day , went shopping-for her coat , for a special pair of shoes since he had such trouble now with his feet . " We bumped into someone else that trip , " Mr. Lydia said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . " " Small world , " Mrs. Lydia said again , tugging at her ear with her gloved hand again , not looking at Jane this time , just looking up the stairs at the balcony . " Better get back in there , " said Bob , nodding toward the inside of the church , touching Jane 's elbow . " Come on , " said Mrs. Lydia , tapping her husband 's sleeve with a program . " Let 's go . Lovely to see you . " She wiggled her fingers at Jane , then moved up the stairs . Jane squeezed past a group of people standing right in the doorway , and went back to their pew , tugging her coat around her , crossing her legs , cold inside their black wool slacks . " Miami ? " she said to her husband . " What was he talking about ? " Bob thrust out his lower lip and shrugged , to indicate he did n't know . " When were you in Miami ? " " He must have meant Orlando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there ? " " You bumped into the Lydias at an airport in Florida ? You never told me that . " " I 'm sure I did . It was ages ago . " The music took over the church . It took up all the space that was n't filled with people or coats or pews , it took up all the space in Jane Burgess " head . She actually moved her neck back and forth as though to shake off the cumbersome weight of the sound , and realized that she had never liked music . It seemed to bring back all the shadows and aches of a lifetime . Let others enjoy it , these people listening so seriously in their fur coats , their red felt hats , their tiresome lives-a pressure on her knee , her husband 's hand . She gazed at his hand , spread over her black coat that they had bought together . It was the large hand of an old man ; a beautiful hand with the long fingers and the veins rising across ; as familiar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you all right ? " He had put his mouth against her ear , but she thought he had whispered too loudly . She made a circular motion with two fingers , their own sign language from years back , Let 's go , and he nodded . " You all right , Janie ? " he asked on the sidewalk , his hand under her elbow . " Oh , I get tired of that heavy music somehow . Do you mind ? " " No . I 'd had enough . " In the car , in the darkness and the silence of the car , she felt some knowledge pass between them . And it had been sitting there in church with them too , like a child pressed between them in the pew , this thing , this presence that had made its way into their evening . She said quietly , " Oh , God . " " What , Janie . " She shook her head , and he did not ask again . A traffic light up ahead turned yellow . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurted out : " I hate her . " " Who ? " His tone was surprised . " Donna Granger . I hate her . There 's something creepy about her . Smug . Your bunny rabbits . I hate her . " Jane actually stamped a foot against the floor of the car . " I ca n't think she 's worth all that emotion , Janie . I mean , really , do you ? " asked Bob , and from the corner of her eye she saw that he did n't turn his head to look at her as he asked this . In the silence that followed , Jane 's anger grew ; it became immense , swelling like water around them , as if they had suddenly driven over a bridge and into a pond below-stagnant , cold stuff filled up around them . " She was so busy getting her hair done she did n't even know her kid was pregnant . Did n't even know it ! Still does n't know it , probably . She still does n't know that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one to worry myself sick ! " " You were nice to those girls . " " That younger sister , though , Patty . She was a nasty thing . I never trusted her , and Tracy should n't have , either . " " What in the world are you talking about ? " " Tracy was too innocent , you know . Do n't you remember that night she had a slumber party and ended up so crushed ? " " There must have been a hundred slumber parties over the years , Jane . No , I do n't remember that one . " " Patty Granger told Tracy how some other girl did n't like her , some girl . She does n't really like you , you know . " Jane was almost ready to cry , recalling this . Her chin tingled . " What are you talking about ? You loved Patty . " " I fed Patty , " Jane answered fiercely . " I fed the goddamn girl for years . Those parents were never home , going this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , leaving other people to take care of their kids . " " Janie , calm down . " " Please do n't tell me to calm down , " she said . " Please do n't do that , Bob . " She heard him sigh quietly , could picture in the dark how he rolled his eyes . They drove the rest of the way in silence , passing Christmas lights , twinkling reindeer ; Janie looked out the window , her hands jammed into the pockets of her coat . It was n't until they were through town , out on the final long stretch of Basing Hill Road , that Jane spoke again , quietly , with a genuine confusion in her voice . " Bobby , I did n't know you 'd ever run into the Lydias at the Orlando airport . I do n't think you ever told me that . " " You probably forgot . It was a long time ago . " Ahead of them through the trees the moon gleamed like a shiny little curved particle in the black sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-filled mind . It was the way the Lydia woman had looked at her , and then looked away , right before going up the balcony stairs . Purposefully now , Jane made her voice calm , almost conversational . " Bobby , " she said , " Please tell me the truth . You did see them at the Miami airport , did n't you ? " And when he did n't answer , she felt her bowels ache , and an age-old sliver of dark , dark pain shudder down through her  --  how tired it made her , that particular , familiar pain ; a black wave that rolled over everything , extinguishing Christmas lights , street lamps , fresh snow ; the loveliness of all things-all gone . " Oh , God , " she said . " I ca n't believe it . " She added , " I really ca n't believe it . " Bob pulled the car into the driveway and turned off the engine . They sat . " Janie , " he said . " Tell me . " So calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . She could hear in the darkness of the car how his breathing was quicker now ; and her own was , too . She wanted to say their hearts were too old for this now ; that you ca n't keep doing this to a heart , ca n't keep on expecting your heart to pull through . In the dim light that shone from their front porch , his face looked ghastly and ghostly . He must not die right now . " Just tell me , " she said again , kindly . " She got breast cancer , Janie . She called me at the office that spring before I retired , and I had n't heard from her in years . Really years , Janie . " " O.K. , " Jane said . " She was very unhappy . I felt bad . " He still did not look at her , he stared over the steering wheel . " I felt ... I do n't know . I can tell you I wished she had n't called . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to go to Orlando to close that account , so I told her I 'd come see her , and I did . I went down to Miami and I saw her , and it was awful , it was pathetic , and the next day I flew back from Miami where I saw the Grangers . " " You spent the night with her in Miami ? " Jane was shivering now , her teeth would chatter if she let them . Bob was slumped in his seat . He put his head back on the headrest and closed his eyes . " I wanted to drive back to Orlando that night . That 's what I planned . But it was late , I did n't feel like I could leave , and then , frankly , it was too late for me to feel I could safely drive back . It was awful , Janie . If you could know how stupid and awful and miserable it was . " " So how much have you spoken with her since then ? " " I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was it . I 'm telling you the truth . " " Is she dead ? " He shook his head . " I have no idea . I probably would have heard from Scott or Barry maybe , if she 'd died , so I assume she has n't . But I have no idea . " " Do you think about her ? " He looked at her pleadingly in the semidarkness . " Jane , I think of you . I care about you . Only you . Janie , it was four years ago . That 's a long time . " " No , it is n't . At our age it 's like turning a couple of quick pages . Blip-blip . " She made a hand gesture in the dark , a quick back and forth . He did n't answer this but only looked at her with his head still back a ainst the headrest as though he had fallen out of some tree and lay now , unable to sit up , his eyes rolling sideways to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters is you , Janie . She does n't matter to me . Seeing her-it did n't matter to me . I just did it because she wanted me to . " She pictured his mother : tall and dark-eyed , this woman who had been so quietly , always , angry . He was frightened of women being angry . But oh-he was an old man now ! And so she said sincerely , " But I just do n't understand . I mean , at this point in our lives , I just do n't understand . " " I do n't blame you , Janie . It 's ridiculous . It was so-nothing . " He put a large gloved hand over his face . " I have to go in . I 'm freezing . " She got out of the car and went up the front steps of their home as though she were stumbling , but she did n't stumble . She waited for him to unlock the door and then moved past him into the kitchen , then through the dining room into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He followed her and turned on the lamp , then sat on the coffee table , facing her . For a long time they just sat . And she felt that her heart was broken again . Only now she was old , so it was different . He slipped off his coat . " Can I get you anything ? " he asked . " You want some hot chocolate ? Tea ? " She shook her head . " Take your coat off , though , Janie . " " No , " she said . " I 'm cold . " " Oh , please , Janie . " He went upstairs and came back down with her favorite sweater , a yellow angora cardigan . She put the sweater on her lap . He sat down next to her on the couch . " Oh , Janie , " he said . " I 've made you so sad . " She let him help her , in a moment , put the sweater on . " We 're getting old , " she said then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Janie . " " I 'm scared of it , Bobby . " " Come to bed now , " he said . But she shook her head . She asked , pulling back from his arm , which had gone around her , " Did n't she ever marry ? " " Oh , no , " he said . " No , she never married . She 's mental , Janie . " After a moment , Jane said , " I do n't want to talk about her . " " I do n't either . " " Never again . " " Never again . " She said , " It 's that we 're running out of time . " " No , we 're not , Janie . We still have time together . We could still have twenty years together . " When he said that , she felt a deep and sudden pity for him . " I need to sit here for just a few more minutes , " she said . " You go on up to bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so they sat . The lamp from the side table threw a dim and serious light throughout the silent room . She took a deep , quiet breath and thought how she did not envy those young girls in the ice cream shop . Behind the bored eyes of the waitresses handing out sundaes there loomed , she knew , great earnestness , great desires , and great disappointments ; such confusion lay ahead for them and ( more wearisome ) anger ; oh , before they were through they would blame and blame , and then get tired , too . Mrs. Lydia had been right , she was not a risk taker . She did n't need to jump out of planes , the way her son Timmy had needed to do . Life itself had always been scary enough , treacherous . She had known from a young age how this was true . She felt that she was falling through the darkness , here in her own home , her own living room . Next to her she heard her husband 's breathing change ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back against the cushions of the couch . And then she saw him give a start . " What is it ? " She touched his shoulder . " Bobby , what were you just dreaming ? " " Whew , " he said , raising his head . In the dim light of the living room he looked like a half-plucked bird ; his thin , dry hair sticking out in different angled patches from his head . " The concert hall roof fell in , " he said . She leaned toward him . " I 'm right here , " putting her palm to the side of his face . Because what did they have now , except for each other , and what could you do if it was not even quite that ?
