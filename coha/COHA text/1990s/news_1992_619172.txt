<p> MRS . N. DEAREST did it again , producing a solution to a long-running problem in our little musical world , and it involves the San Francisco Symphony . <p> It started innocently when a prominent member of the Symphony 's board offhandedly asked me at a recent dinner , " What do you think the Symphony ought to do in the summer ? " He caught me off guard . I 'd long since yielded to a kind of cynical acceptance of the status quo , coming to regard the summer months as the period of hibernation . <p> The trouble is , I responded , that in the summertime concert music all over the country goes strictly recreational , with pops and endless reruns of the most obvious repertory . The same soloists are featured playing the same old pieces . It 's music for people who only go to concerts while on vacation . <p> Where the climate turns really hot , it makes sense to turn folks out into some nice rural meadow and motivate their getting out of the city with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summer usually means nights too foggy and cold for outdoor concerts . <p> Historically , I explained , attempts to create serious summer music festivals with the Symphony have never come off . Clark Kerr cherished the concept on the Berkeley campus , modeled after the Boston Symphony 's Berkshire Music Festival at Tanglewood . The chancellor and later president of the University of California , Kerr wanted the San Francisco Symphony to perform in UC 's Greek Theatre . Kerr 's protege , Dean McHenry , the first chancellor of the UC campus at Santa Cruz , envisaged such a festival in an old quarry on the campus . A portion of the 250-acre House-on-Hill estate of the late Mrs. C. Tobin Clark was earmarked for the Symphony as part of a real estate developer 's proposal for that Hillsborough property but nothing came of that idea . <p> A broad-spectrum festival with the Symphony in residence is appealing but , for simple demographic reasons , it may never have been in the cards . The Bay Area lacks a population base comparable to the New York-Boston axis that feeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer activities . From 1970 to 1979 , it ran a Summer Music Workshop program for the city 's public school students , and at Lowell High School for high school instrumentalists . It was a wonderful project , conceived and significantly underwritten by the symphony 's longtime vice president , Agnes Albert . The Symphony , in conjunction with the City 's School District and the PTA , continues to work with students in the summer , giving orchestral demonstrations until 1979 and presenting individual small emsembles since then . <p> The Symphony 's few trips to the Concord Pavilion proved that east Contra Costa County , for all its growth , had even less interest in symphonic concerts than the Peninsula . Even a pair of Symphony concerts there featuring Montserrat Caballe , at the height of her drawing power , did not do at all well . So much for the Symphony 's summering in the hinterlands . <p> Recent summers have seen no other new ventures . The Symphony continues to meet its traditional commitments , unexceptional in every way . In June , following the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been instituted . For two weeks in July , the orchestra accompanies the Joffrey Ballet during its Symphony association-sponsored engagement in the Opera House . Then there are Pops concerts sponsored by the Arts Commission , one or two concerts in Stern Grove and then dark , for August vacations . So the Symphony treads water for eight weeks with 100 of the most highly skilled , highly paid musicians in the West . <p> WHAT 'S really needed , I said , is a connected series of events with real musical significance . If a major American orchestra were to break out of the summer doldrums and do something truly distinctive and special , that activity would gain instant national attention , vitalize the home public and draw in visitors . <p> Three hours later came the idea from Mrs. N. Dearest of the East Bay . " What about the Symphony 's doing a series focusing on the 20th Century ? " She did n't mean a little of this and a little of that in some nice marketing package designed to beguile the casual public . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the century drawing to a close . <p> Where have we been ? Not just which are the masterpieces , but what are the principal lines , the schools , currents and trends , their origins and relationships ? How did the neo-classic revolt against romanticism come about  --  Stravinsky , Hindemith and those they influenced . How far did it penetrate and how did it give way ? What was the course of music 's great antithesis in the 20th Century  --  between music adhering to tonality and the so-called atonal music composed using 12-tone and serial techniques ? <p> Where do the other currents fit in ? The avant-garde trends from the late ' 50s on , both central European and American from Europe , the influence of John Cage , the Americanists ( Ives , Cowell , Ruggles , Thomson , Harris , Copland , Schuman ) , the romanticism that never left off ( such composers as Howard Hanson and Samuel Barber ) as opposed to the romanticism that reappeared aggressively and nostalgically in the century 's last two decades ( Berio , Rochberg , Del @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the influence of ethnic music and styles and its independent resurgence . <p> The currents are many and their fascinating interworkings are the most revealing aspect . We 've reached the point where the musical history of the century is set and people need and want to know what it 's all been about . The New York Philharmonic 's exploration of " The New Romanticism " a few years ago , though far from perfect , was a fair example of addressing that need . <p> Clearly the whole subject is many times too large for a single summer music series . ( The word " festival " is inappropriate in this connection . The term 's been exploited as a marketing tool to the point where it can hardly be associated with a serious project . ) But there are several summers left in the century . Each could serve a different theme . Here are three . The Great Divide : The Sea Change in Musical Styles after World War II , or The Century 's Mid-Point . The Modern Romanticism : Tradition , Revival and Renewal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mainstream . <p> It would be crucial that a musical organizing mind be in charge , one who is performance oriented , probably a composer but not an academic . Gunther Schuller and Pierre Boulez are two composer-conductors who have had outstanding records creating and directing just such exploratory programs . <p> Schuller , who was director of contemporary music activities at the Berkshire Music Festival from 1974 to 1984 , has a range of expertise that includes jazz , ethnic and vernacular styles . Boulez tends to be doctrinaire and can not know American music comprehensively enough but he would command considerable attention from afar . <p> The other nominees are American . Excepting only Boulez , conductors from the European continent do not think and create programs that synthesize large topics . Three who are leaders in exploratory programming are Michael Tilson Thomas , Leonard Slatkin and Dennis Russell Davies . Davies demonstrated that nearby at the Cabrillo Music Festival , which he no longer directs , and with the American Composers Orchestra . <p> Conductors , however , tend to pick up on what is currently trendy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more thorough grasp of the fundamental issues and the larger picture and are therefore better qualified to plan and direct such a series . Examples are Jacob Druckman 's direction of the New York Philharmonic 's " New Romanticism " two-year series , and some of John Adams ' programming for the San Francisco Symphony 's New and Unusual Music series . <p> In any event , this series must not be the vehicle or province of any single conductor . Two or perhaps more of them should be involved each year , taking advantage of individual conductors ' special aptitudes for particular kinds and styles of music . The finest 20th Century music performers should be featured , such pianists as Alan Feinberg , Ursula Oppens and Richard Goode ; violinists Gidon Kramer , Paul Zukovsky and Robert McDuffie , the Arditti and Composers String Quartets , and the Kronos when their specially oriented and crossover repertory is called for . <p> THE AMERICAN music public would sit up and take notice of such a project , but only if it were done with the best in mind , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it . Scheduling the series in what are conventionally the musical dog days in June or July would insure that there were no competition , nothing of comparable musical stature occurring in the hemisphere . <p> Loyal San Francisco Symphony patrons are always hopefully querying about their orchestra 's national " ranking . " To the extent that such a concern is at all worthy or relevant to the purposes of music and an orchestra , it turns on far more than orchestral virtuosity and reviews of recordings and tour performances of standard repertory . It has to do with initiative and leadership , qualities that this country needs right now in the most important way . Thank you , Mrs. N.D. Make history , San Francisco Symphony .
