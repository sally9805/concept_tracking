ON HER FIRST NIGHT HOME in two years , Sandra McCain slept in her mother 's old sewing room . Her own room had been filled with furniture from the store downstairs . One side of the first floor was McCain 's Furniture , and the other side was McCain 's Funeral Home . As a teenager , after her mother died , Sandra had worked in the store ; and as children , she and her brother had played hide-and-seek between the parallels of the divans . Now , since her father 's stroke , a small staff operated the furniture store , but the funeral side was closed . <p> During the night , she heard her father 's cane stab the hallway floor . She heard the commode flush . <p> " Well , Sandy , so you decide to come home to your old daddy when you think I 'm going to kick the bucket , " her father , Claude , had said earlier that evening as they sat on the balcony watching lightning bugs . <p> " I 'm glad to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He had always been able to turn on the charm downstairs , but upstairs he was plainspoken . The stroke was mild , but it had weakened him . " We never used to have flowers like this out here , " Sandra said . The balcony was framed by half a dozen swinging baskets of fuchsias and geraniums . <p> " Damn place has always been full of flowers . " <p> " But these are so friendly , not like all those horrible glads and mums that were always downstairs . " <p> Claude made a fist , then released his fingers , an exercise to work out the deadness in his arm . " When are you going to marry and settle down ? " <p> " You always ask me that . You seem to forget I was married once . " <p> " How come you did n't stay married ? " <p> " We wanted different things . " <p> " A man and woman always want different things , " he said . <p> " Well , Dad , I sure do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He grunted . " What 's it like up there in Alaska , anyway ? Is it like that old show Northern Exposure ' ? " <p> " Not really . It 's dark most of the time . And there 's snow . And it 's colder . " <p> In Alaska , the long summer light was beginning , and the darkness down here in Kentucky felt unnatural . From the balcony , the moonless sky seemed claustrophobic , but the lightning bugs winked little glimmers of hope . <p> Her father had been in this dying town all his adult life , putting people to rest . Surely his work had distorted his perspective , she thought . In high school she had hated him , hated his work . But now she regretted the gulf between them . That impulsive marriage was years ago , when she was in her early twenties . She and Wayne were married at Herrington Lake , near Lexington . Her father had a funeral to direct and did not come . At the end of the ceremony , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she saw the wedding photos , her mind superimposed tuxedoes on the guests . Wayne was large and comfortable with himself . He had dozens of good qualities . One of them was his simple sincerity . Another was the way he thought well of people , regardless of their flaws . Wayne was in graduate school , studying engineering , and Sandra was getting an M.A. in communications . One night , in the middle of a chapter called " The Dysfunction of the Mass-Communicated , " she suddenly threw the book across the room . She never went back to class . <p> In the morning , Sandra brought her father a cup of herb tea and a bowl of granola . He was sitting on the balcony in a recliner from the store . By now , Sandra had readjusted her memory of him to include the new gray in his hair , the larger bald spot , the paler cheeks . <p> " I do n't want that stuff , " he said , making a face at the cereal . <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cholesterol and fat . " This is what I eat in Alaska . " <p> " This is not Alaska , " he said . " I read where people should eat what 's right for their climate . That 's why Eskimos eat whale blubber and the Chinese eat rice . Do n't you eat blubber up there ? " <p> " Why am I trying to talk sense to you ? " <p> He grinned . " I read about this guy who lived to be a hundred , and he had never eaten anything impure . He finally died of old age . About two days before he died he stopped eating . It was n't that he was n't hungry . He just thought it would be more natural to fast before he died . " As he laughed , his cane fell to the floor . <p> " A creature of habit , " said Sandra , retrieving the cane . " He could n't change . " <p> " If I had denied myself that long , I 'd be calling for a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He chuckled , teasing Sandra . " Would you bring me whiskey and Goo-Goo Clusters on my deathbed ? " <p> She laughed . " Anything you say , Daddy , " she said . <p> Sandra opened the refrigerator and swapped the granola for a carton of eggs . She wondered if he was just being stubborn about his diet , or if his line of work had taught him something about dying . He was too young to die . The idea of his death made her furious , partly at herself , for waiting so long to come home . <p> Sandra pedaled around town on her father 's bicycle . Cork ( Pop . 1,700 ) was surrounded by cornfields  --  flat bottomland of western Kentucky . The hardware store had closed long ago , but the florist 's shop , the tiny grocery , the post office , and a gas station still lined Main Street . McCain 's , one of the half-dozen large old houses in town , was faded yellow , and the wood siding was warped . <p> She crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christmas-tree farm . They always had a tree for the store , one for the living room , and one for the funeral home . Once , a child had died just before Christmas , and the family had brought the child 's presents and set them under the tree . After the burial , Sandra 's father returned the packages to the grieving parents , together with the guest register and the thank-you cards . The family kept the gifts at home , unopened , and never took down their tree . Now Sandra realized that she might have only imagined that part of the story . <p> She rode for two miles or more , passing house trailers and occasional new brick homes . After being in Alaska , she thought this landscape seemed small and tame . There was not much wild left , though the new houses appeared to have sprung up like funguses in the fields . Alaska was far away . And Tom Girardeau seemed like someone she barely knew . She tried to imagine Tom at the Riverside Restaurant late at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steamed clams and insect spray . They often sat there for hours , watching the floatplanes take off and land on the Chena . She was sorry to miss solstice . Tom would go with friends up to Eagle Summit , where the sun seemed to crawl horizontally across the sky . <p> On the way back into town , she stopped at her widowed aunt 's small brick house . A red pickup was parked on the street , and a boy was mowing the yard . Aunt Clemmie , Sandra 's father 's sister , had tried to mother her and her brother , Kent , after their mother died , but they resisted . Sandra had been fiercely secretive and would never confide in Clemmie-not even about her nightmares , or her grief , or her certainty of her father 's crime against her mother . <p> Clemmie let Sandra in the side door . " I bet you wish you had some of this weather up there in Alaska , Sandra . Do n't you freeze your behind up there ? " <p> " You get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strawberry preserves on the kitchen counter . Just then the lid popped as it sealed . " I love the snow , " she said . <p> " It snowed here the second of March , " Clemmie said . " It killed the peaches . " <p> " How do you think Dad 's doing , Aunt Clemmie ? " Sandra asked as she absently patted the cat , a haughty Persian with a breathing problem . <p> " Oh , honey , I do n't know . The doctors said the arteries in his neck are blocked , and that was n't a good sign . But since you came home , he 's doing so well I see color in his face I had n't seen in months . He 's real proud you decided to come home . " <p> " I do n't know what I ought to do , " Sandra said as they moved to the living room . She sat in an easy chair spotted with doilies . <p> Clemmie said , " That brother of yours has n't been down since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard and has a family . " <p> Her aunt 's tone was apologetic  --  Kent could be excused because he had responsibilities ; Sandra had no responsibilities , since she had voluntarily gone to Alaska and was not married to the man she lived with . <p> " It was just extraordinary your daddy did what he did , " Clemmie said , inviting the cat into her lap . " Raising you and Kent by himself and operating those businesses . " She laughed . " We used to tease him about people coming to view the body and then on the way out shopping for dinettes . Dine now , die later , ' we 'd say . " The cat looked at Clemmie admiringly , as if she were telling him stories . Clemmie went on , " Claude had a time with you kids . Oh , you fought him , and he could n't do a thing with you . He blames himself for the way you turned out  --  " <p> " How 's that ? " Sandra said sharply . The cat glared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traipsing around you do . He worries about you up there . He 's afraid you 'll freeze or get eaten up by a bear . " <p> " He never said that . " <p> " Claude never lets on about his personal feelings . But he forgives you . " <p> " Forgives me ? " <p> " Do n't go on blaming him for everything , Sandra , " said Clemmie gently . " That 's the way with everybody these days . " <p> Sandra settled her head back against a crocheted doily and listened to her aunt chatter . She imagined herself as a dead person , her head resting on a satin pillow , with lace framing her face . If she stayed here , her head would just keep sinking until she lost all feeling , like someone in a sensory deprivation tank . <p> When Clemmie telephoned about the stroke , she had begged Sandra to come back home . She said , " He always claimed he did n't need anybody , but he 's been lonesome since you kids left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man he was before your mother died , you were so young , but losing her made him draw up in a knot . " <p> Sandra did remember . She remembered the night her father erected a teepee on the balcony for her and Kent when they were little . It was fashioned from a faded funeral canopy . Her father made hoot-owl and ghost noises in the night to scare them while they camped . She remembered evenings when they churned ice cream on the balcony , and he teased her mother , pinching her playfully on the rear . Sandra 's mother had her hair fixed every Friday morning at Maybell 's Beauty Parlor , to be nice for the weekend . And Claude joked about her hairdo . " Did you sleep in your hair wrong , Sally ? It looks lopsided . Have the squirrels been in your hair ? " When she was dressed up and had her makeup on , with bright red lipstick , he would say , " Your mouth looks just like a hen 's butt . " Back then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to suspend them up in space  --  away from the crowded furniture , away from the bodies in the dark parlor . It was as though they were riding in a hot-air balloon . They watched thunderstorms from the balcony . <p> Two years ago , when Sandra 's plane circled low over Fairbanks , the first thing she noticed was the bright neon sign of a Safeway . Sandra had promised herself she would stay two years in Alaska , and she had . She stayed there longer than she was married , longer than any of her stretches of school or jobs . She wrote her father occasional postcards , typical pictures of bears and moose , with pointed references to how cold and wild it was . She went to Alaska with only a duffel bag , stuffed with the remnants of her belongings from ten years of moving around . The one loss she regretted in all her wanderings was the dog she had had in Lexington after her divorce . She was working at the human services agency and lived in a basement apartment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dog had the energy and endurance of a sled dog , she thought later . He loved to stay outside in the winter , his coat thick and glossy , even when the water in his dish was frozen . He had been poisoned , the veterinarian told her after she found him dead . He was stretched out on his side , at the basement entrance , as though he had been trying to get indoors . A puddle of blood was under his tail . <p> In Alaska , Tom kept sled dogs as a hobby , but Sandra never grew attached to them . She had expected sled dogs to be beautiful , but not all were huskies and malamutes : most of Tom 's were skinny mixed breeds . He said , " People will run anything that 's fast . They run hounds , shepherds . I even heard of somebody running a Scottie dog . And there 's a guy who 's trying to breed huskies with coyotes . " Tom 's dogs were chained to doghouses inside a wooden pen , with old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneous concert to occur , with the dogs howling accompaniment . Once , when she and Tom were canoeing , they passed a group of sled dogs on the riverbank . They were on top of their houses , howling in chorus . It was near midnight , in that mellow light of early summer . <p> Sandra lived with Tom in a log house near Fairbanks , on the south slope of a hill with a view of the Chena River . On clear days they could see the jagged ridge of the Alaska Range , mountains crinkled up like freeze-dried clouds . Tom worked for the agency where she had found an office job . In the dead of winter they rose at three in the morning to warm up the car . When she moved in , he had said only half-teasingly , " I can already see the day you 'll move out . How long will you last out here in the elements ? " <p> " I might last longer than you think , " she said stubbornly . <p> " No , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin . " He seemed a little sad . <p> He had been in Alaska long enough to know exactly at what temperature the car 's engine would freeze up , exactly how many layers of clothing to wear in what weather . He knew how to dry salmon , how to repair a canoe . He had built the outhouse and the sunspace , where he was able to grow a few salad greens . He had come to Alaska to work on the pipeline and stayed because he fell for the frontier lifestyle  --  if living by necessity could be called a style , a point they argued about . She thought he romanticized hardship as much as she valued change . The dog team was n't necessary , and he kept more dogs than he needed for one sled . The dogs ' energy was like a basketball team in action , and Sandra felt that their howls in the night were comforting music . The darkness grew tight around her in the winter , as if it cut her off from the rest of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noggin of North America . Sandra lost her sense of time in the first long , dark winter : four A.M. and four P.M. seemed the same . But as she stayed on she learned that there was no pure division between light and dark . It was always becoming lighter or darker , like the moon inching through its phases . <p> When Sandra learned about her father 's stroke , Tom encouraged her to go take care of him , insisting so emphatically that she felt he was pushing her away , as if he were asking her to go out with another man . <p> " If you do n't go , you 'll be sorry the rest of your life , " he said . " You have to go work it out with him . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " You blamed him for what he did to your mom . " <p> " She had a kidney disease . She did n't catch it from him . " <p> " That 's not what I mean . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't know she would die . " <p> " So now you wo n't trust any man . " <p> " Do n't I trust you ? " <p> " No , you do n't , " he said . " If you did , then you could say you love me . You never say you love me . " <p> Late that winter , Tom set out early one morning , running the dogs on some trails toward Nenana . He did not return until after the sun had come and gone . She was worried , even though she knew the cold was something Tom had clear rules about . He carried sled-repair equipment , ice creepers , camping gear , even a sewing kit and plastic booties for the dogs . As the dark deepened and she shoved more wood in the stove , she thought she heard a dog yelp , but it was only the wind . At last , in the moonlight , she saw the dogs coming , their shadows cavorting on the snow . Tom , still exhilarated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stove . His cheeks were flaming , and ice crystals matted his beard . Looking outside at the dogs , still frisking on their chains , she felt foolish . She wondered if her hysteria was only cabin fever , her desire to be on the trail to somewhere else . The next morning fresh snow had obliterated the doghouses . The dogs used the snow for a blanket . They burrowed , breathing through little blowholes . <p> When she left for Kentucky at the end of May , Tom drove her to the airport . On the way they saw a ski team racing down the highway on short , wheeled skis . In town , when the summer light came , children undulated through the streets on skateboards . Tom used a three-wheeler to run his dogs in the summer . Before Sandra boarded the plane , she told him , " I do n't know when I 'll be back . " She knew he thought she would n't be back . Yet she did n't know how long she could bear to stay at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that looked amazingly like her old dog  --  the same facial markings and coloring , but most significant , the same shy , agreeable expression , the same warmth in his eyes , as if he recognized her . The dog was in a wooden pen in a small settlement where most yards were littered with the battered remains of frontier living-oil barrels , rusted refrigerators , airplane parts . The tiny post office was having a rummage sale on its porch . She thought of trying to buy the dog , but she decided it would be a great mistake to get one so much like the original . It would be unfair , both to the former dog and to the new dog . <p> On the balcony , as they sat together in the evenings , she tried to tell her father about her life in Alaska , nervously straining for words to describe the darkness of winter , the continuous daylight of summer , the brilliant colors of the wildflowers , the size of the mosquitoes . She realized she was exaggerating everything . There seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of dragonflies , she said . Almost as big as those little remote-controlled airplanes she had heard when she was biking past a field near Cork . She had automatically looked up for a bush plane and had momentarily visualized herself sitting at the Riverside having a beer while floatplanes landed on the Chena and the mosquitoes buzzed like friendly visitors around her head . Now she realized she was exaggerating to her father partly because she could n't remember ; there was n't a clear line drawn between the ordinary and the fantastic in her mind . <p> Once , she tried to describe the northern lights to her father . The night was humid , and sheet lightning flared in the distance . " The aurora is like neon signs , and it works on the same principle , " she said . Words failed . She thought of the pulsating colors and showers of brilliant light , sometimes described as a Chinese dragon undulating through the sky . She said , " The Tlingit Indians say the lights are spirits of the dead dancing  --  happy spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walrus skull . " <p> " I wish I could have seen that , " he said softly . " I never got to go many places , holding down two businesses . " <p> It made Sandra angry that he talked as if his life were nearly over . She said , " You could still go to Alaska . You 're not even old . You 've just been around death for so long it 's rubbed off on you . " She waited for a motorcycle sound to pass . " You could come and see me , " she said . <p> The next day Sandra drove her father 's car to the library in the county seat and looked for pictures of the northern lights . She found a travel book that had a couple of photographs . In the car she examined them in the strong sunlight . The lights were nothing like she had described . Although the photos were not splendid , she realized that the northern lights were even more spectacular than she remembered  --  the sheer vastness of the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the colors . They were more phenomenal than she could comprehend , so she could n't remember what they were like . She thought that sometimes sights and sounds were so unreal  --  like the news of someone 's death  --  they could not be remembered or believed . She had exaggerated the mosquitoes but underestimated the northern lights . She recalled what she had said to Tom when they saw the lights together the first time : she said they were like an orgasm . Later , during an orgasm , she felt it was like the northern lights , and that her awareness of that got in the way . When she told Tom this later , he said , " That 's like looking up a word in the dictionary , and it gives you another word you do n't know ; and when you look up that one , it refers you back to the first word . " <p> She thought if she showed her father the pictures , he would not believe them ; he would not believe his daughter could have experienced anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she would have to tell him . <p> As the days passed , her father grew stronger , and Sandra stayed on in Cork , uncertain what she wanted to do . She felt she was testing herself , revisiting old memories and fears  --  the creepiness of living above a funeral home . Now that its doors were closed , she could imagine all the ghosts of the dead trapped in there . In her sleep , they hammered and clawed and whistled from the cavern below . <p> Clemmie came over every day , sometimes bringing videos from the grocery . She cooked for them  --  fried chicken and ham and strawberry cake . Sandra 's father battled his way around , brandishing his cane like a sword and swearing at life . He seemed his old self . <p> " I do n't know when I 'll be back , " Sandra wrote to Tom . " Give my love to Brubeck , Coltrane , Satchmo , Thelonius , Dizzy , Billie , Mulligan , Miles , Fats . You may not believe this , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her letter , she received one from Tom . He wrote news of the dogs , the weather , the moose that visited the stream in the backyard . He was working an extra construction job in the evenings during the summer light and barely had time to scrawl notes to her . He did n't have time to run the dogs now , and they were growing desperate-howling and breaking loose . He was thinking of giving them up . Sandra could feel the dogs escaping , racing away from her , running faster and faster . <p> Sandra and her father were eating lunch . She had been helping out in the furniture store and had come upstairs to make some tuna salad . Claude said , " When I 'm gone , you and Kent can fight over the business . " <p> " Where are you going ? " <p> " I think I 'll close down the home for good . We never had more than two funerals a month anyway , and nowadays they want something fancier , or else they want to be cremated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would catch a fish , Sandra thought . He went on , " I always tried to make it homey , so people would n't feel out of place . It would n't be hard to turn into apartments . " <p> " Who would want to live in it ? " Sandra said glumly . <p> " If you move out all the equipment and get rid of those morbid old carvings and lamps , you could have a pretty big apartment house here . " <p> To Sandra 's surprise , her father began to sob . Tentatively , she touched his shoulder . He straightened up and cleared his throat . <p> He said , " There 's something I want you to have  --  that old furniture of your **31;818;TOOLONG . " <p> " Those old chairs in the sewing room ? " <p> " There 's more in the basement . I 'll get it out when I 'm able . I want you to have it when you know where you 're going to be . " He pushed his plate forward . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It used to be in the dining room when I was real little . I had n't thought of it in years . " <p> " I stored it away when your mother got all Danish modern upstairs . Your **29;851;TOOLONG made that furniture  --  Thomas McCain . " <p> " The one who started the business ? " Sandra had only vague notions about such a distant past . <p> Claude nodded . " Thomas McCain was a carpenter , and in the old days , carpenters spent a lot of their time making coffins . " " Who was he ? Where did he come from ? " asked Sandra , suddenly curious for the first time in her life about the past . <p> " He came here from North Carolina in about 1850 , " Claude said as he reached for his cane . " He buried four wives and four children . He made their caskets , and it was such pretty work people started coming to him for their caskets . " <p> " People died young then , " Sandra commented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting to be embalmed and laid out in public . His son John McCain put out his shingle in 1889  --  Cabinetmaker and Undertaker . " <p> Sandra 's father stopped to reflect , as if he could actually remember that far back . " Thomas McCain had fourteen children , and his first four wives died in childbirth . But he kept going  --  kept finding new young wives to tend to all those babies . " Claude laughed . " I always think about Thomas McCain when I take care of the dead . He 's always in the background , giving me advice . " <p> Sandra started hanging around the furniture store . The place could use a few new ideas , she thought . <p> " God , Daddy , some of this down here looks like furniture from hell ! " she yelled from the sidewalk . He was on the balcony , reading an undertakers ' journal . " Only Satanists would buy it . " <p> He had n't said any more about the furniture he wanted her to have . She let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a collection of ratty old pieces . She did n't want to be responsible for them . Sandra rearranged the store , making new combinations of tables and lamps and couches . She replaced the tacky dinette set in the window with plush love seats . As a child she had played with her dolls amid the clumsy furniture , and now she was playing there again , as a grownup . That was what she had always done with her life , she thought . In Alaska , Tom 's log house was like a playhouse . She spent her time playing Scrabble with Tom , working jigsaw puzzles , making salmon quiche , building fires . She missed Alaska . In her memory it was warm , not cold . <p> Clemmie was sitting with them on the balcony , smocking a pinafore for a grandbaby . It was n't quite dark . Teenagers on their way to the softball game passed below , screeching and kidding each other , yelling casual obscenities . Children on bicycles raced up the street , and barefoot kids tiptoed across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow is the longest day of the year , " Claude said . <p> " In Alaska the sun will shine all night long , " Sandra said . <p> Her father swatted at a bug . It made Sandra furious that he and Clemmie showed so little curiosity about Alaska . She felt twelve years old , burning to leave . <p> " In Alaska there 's always something going on , " she said calmly . " Something incredible to see . " <p> Clemmie said , " The longest day of the year always comes sooner than I expect it to . I 'm never ready for it . " She laughed . " It gets dark so late I do n't get indoors in time to watch my television shows . But they 're all reruns anyway . " <p> The telephone rang , and Sandra dashed inside to answer . <p> " I need to make some arrangements , " a woman said . <p> " I 'm sorry , the funeral home is closed now . " <p> " Well , Claude told me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had cancer , and he went about an hour ago . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " Sandra said . " But my father 's been sick . And the place is closed . " <p> " I know . Is Claude able to come to the phone ? This is Mrs. Bud Johnson . " <p> Sandra recognized the name . Bud Johnson had been an old friend of her father 's . She relayed the message . " What should I tell her ? " <p> " Oh , mercy , " said Claude , struggling up from his chair . " Tell Daisy I 'll have him brought over . I promised . " <p> " Dad , you 're not able to do this . " <p> " Oh , I can do it . I 've got plenty of help . " He nodded at her and Clemmie . <p> He grabbed the telephone and spoke soothingly to Mrs. Johnson . When he hung up , he stomped around the kitchen , punching the air with his cane . " Clemmie , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may need gas and oil . " <p> John was his assistant , an insurance man who had helped at the funeral home part-time for as long as Sandra could remember . <p> " Claude , are you sure you 're up to this ? " asked Clemmie . <p> " John and I can do it if you two can get the place ready , " he said , eyeing Sandra . <p> That night she and her aunt opened the funeral side of the building . It had collected a stagnant sweet smell of powder and dead flowers and incense . They plugged in large window fans and blew the stale air out . Clemmie hauled out the industrial vacuum cleaner from the utility room . Sandra had avoided the funeral parlor for years , but the smells were familiar . She shuddered , and her lungs tightened . <p> Clemmie said as she turned on a chandelier , " Now , Sandra , this wo n't be hard . We 'll just clean up a little , and then tomorrow we 'll take care of the details so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Dad does n't seem sad , " Sandra said , with anger . She realized her hands were trembling . <p> " Sad ? " <p> " Bud Johnson was his friend . " <p> Clemmie smiled . " They used to play in the hayloft when they were kids . They 'd swing out on a rope and fly into the hay . Those boys would do anything for one another . " She punched the switch , and the vacuum cleaner roared across the carpet of the front parlor . <p> Sandra remembered Bud Johnson playing softball with her father  --  with the Kentucky Lakers , a local team . When her mother died , Bud was around all the time ; he brought ice cream on the day of the funeral . Sandra remembered a maze of rooms , outfitted over the years with pieces from the furniture store  --  dark velveteens and brocades , dim lamps with romantic scenes painted on the shades , early-American tables . The whole place looked dilapidated , but lived in , more homelike than the store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head resting on a blue satin pillow , her hair looking nicer than it ever had , lips bright and glistening , almost alive . Her eyes were shadowed , uncharacteristically , her face deeply rouged . Sandra had seen so many dead people by then she barely gave them a thought , but when her own mother lay there , she felt a deep betrayal , as though her father had been preparing all those bodies in anticipation of displaying her mother there one day , in a hairdo too perfect to tease her about . She could never forgive him . <p> As Clemmie vacuumed , Sandra peeked into the closed rooms . She entered the one with the cold metal table that cranked up like an elevator . Once , she and Kent had played doctor/nurse on the table , until their father caught them . He was in there now , cleaning out a sink . <p> " Bud had that prostate trouble for seven years , and it finally got him , " Claude said as he squeezed out a sponge . <p> The hearse arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend in the refrigerated room  --  what the family used to refer to , crudely , as the meat locker .

She heard her father talking to someone . She remembered many times when deliveries arrived in the night . She remembered the quiet hearses . She remembered her father up at all hours , working secretly in the closed rooms . She was forbidden to enter when he worked , and he always warned her and Kent to stay away from the dumpster behind the building . For years she had nightmares about her mother 's ice-cold , bleached body . Again and again , Sandra dreamed that her mother was still downstairs , wandering through the rooms , a prisoner . Now she was afraid to sleep . <p> During the morning , flowers began arriving , and Clemmie and Sandra kept busy dusting and arranging chairs and urns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like grief , she thought . Claude had finished the preparations on the body , and some men had moved the casket into the front parlor . <p> " What a handsome devil ! " Clemmie said when Claude appeared in a dark suit . " Claude , with that cane , you look like somebody in vaudeville . " <p> " I do n't need it anymore , " said Claude with a smile . " It 's just for show . " His step was sure , and his voice stronger . He disappeared into a back room . <p> A boy brought an arrangement from the florist down the street . More flowers  --  the inevitable gladiolus and mums  --  arrived from another town . <p> Sandra asked Clemmie , " Why is n't Dad unhappy that his best friend died ? " <p> " Well , he 's not happy , " Clemmie said , brushing a wisp of hair from Sandra 's forehead . " It 's just that Claude knows what to do at a time like this . " <p> Sandra plunged ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the funeral home and acted like it was some party , a social occasion . They always laughed . " <p> " Calm down , honey . You do what you have to do , " Clemmie said . " People ca n't just go around with a long face . " <p> " They say the wrong things . They gossip and tell jokes . " Sandra was agitated , her head spinning . She might blurt out anything . <p> When Sandra 's mother lay dead in this parlor , Sandra saw her father in a corner talking with Bud Johnson . She remembered her mother lying in the casket , and Claude was trading a fishing story with Bud as though she were only taking a nap . Sandra told Clemmie about this now . " I remember exactly what they said . Bud said , I caught forty bass in that pond , and I did n't even know it had bass in it . ' And Dad said , That was all of them , was n't it ? ' And he laughed . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the wrong things . " She pulled distractedly at her hair . " Everything about funerals is inappropriate , " she said . <p> " Now , honey , " Clemmie said , holding her fat arms around Sandra . " What would people say , Sandy ? What would you have them say ? " <p> Clemmie enveloped her like a down sleeping bag . Sandra was embarrassed and pulled away . <p> " I do n't care what they say . It 's what they do . How could he have done that to Mama ? How could he  --  how could he work on her ? How could anybody do anything like that to anybody ? " Sandra might have been screaming . She was n't sure . <p> " Get that out of your head , " Clemmie said sharply . " He did n't do anything to her body that was n't love . Maybell Cox fixed her hair , and I did her clothes . He got Roy Hicks over here from Hopewell to do the work . " <p> " He did ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know that . " <p> " We told you , but you forgot . Why , you know Claude would n't treat Sally that way . He could n't have . " <p> " I always thought he did . " <p> Clemmie hugged her again , and Sandra did n't struggle . Clemmie said , " Why , Sandra , we had no idea you were bothered about that . " She paused , pushed back , and gazed into Sandra 's face . Her hands clasped Sandra 's shoulders firmly . She said , " But you never know what might be bothering a child . " <p> Sandra said , " I did n't know she was going to die . Dad did n't even take me to the hospital except twice . " <p> " Well , nobody knew she was going to die , " said Clemmie , wiping tears from Sandra 's cheek . " Besides , you said it depressed you to go to the hospital and see all those sick people . You were just a child . And you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't understand . " <p> " Twirling ? " Sandra said . " I was twirling ? " <p> In the afternoon , when the friends of Bud Johnson gathered downstairs , Sandra went to a dark nook upstairs where she used to hide out . Back then she could n't escape totally from the laughter ; now she had a small radio and earphones . She curled up in a nest of musty old cushions and tried to read , listening to some kind of new-age music that sounded like a stuck record . The station , broadcast from the college , called itself " the difficult-listening station . " She forced herself to concentrate on the meaningless sounds until her head vibrated with the yelps of excited sled dogs racing in the bright snow , and she fell asleep . Eventually , Clemmie found her there . <p> " I 'm all right , " Sandra said , stumbling into the light . <p> " OK , honey , I just wanted to know where you were , " Clemmie said . " I saved you some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the carpeted stairs into the funeral parlor . It was empty , except for the casket . The lid had been lowered . Sandra heard her father speaking on the phone in his office . " Now , Daisy , " he was saying . " I knew Bud as well as anybody , and he would n't have wanted to stay hooked up to those tubes . " <p> When he hung up , Sandra said , " Hi . I fell asleep upstairs . " <p> He laughed . " I 'm surprised you could sleep in all this racket . Damn phone 's been ringing off the hook . " His fist opened and closed . " Now what ? " The telephone was ringing again . Clemmie , who had followed Sandra , rushed to answer . <p> " Are you feeling OK , Dad ? " asked Sandra as she straightened a wall carving of a youthful Jesus . It was made of plaster , with glitter scattered on it . <p> " That 's one of those things I 'm going to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He grinned . " I 'm not leaving it for you to inherit . " <p> " I do n't want it , " said Sandra . <p> " I do n't want you to have it , " he said as he squeezed her . He whispered accusingly in her ear , " You ran off from home and did n't think about us . " <p> " I came back , did n't I ? " she mumbled , letting him hold her , more tightly than Tom had ever held her . She started to cry . She knew she could never explain herself to him  --  her exile , her misunderstandings-but that did n't seem so important now . It seemed more important to be kind . She said , " Dad , why do n't you show me that old furniture you wanted me to have ? " <p> He grinned . " How will you get it back to Alaska ? " <p> She knew he was teasing , the way he had always teased Mom . " I 'll FedEx it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are coming down from Akron , Ohio , " Clemmie said , hanging up the telephone . <p> The next morning the mail brought a letter from Tom . He wrote , " A bunch of us took a drive up to Murphy 's dome the other night , up beyond that old DEW system with that white phallic tower . The wildflowers are all out . The lupines are as blue as your eyes . When I was up there , I thought about the time we were there and the wind came up and we almost got hypothermia . We were rushing around naked , and I realized I was sorry I 'd accused you of having southern blood . " <p> She did n't get to finish Tom 's letter because her father appeared , ready to show her the furniture in the basement . He had been too tired yesterday . As she followed him down the hall , Daisy Johnson and a swarm of kin arrived at the door , delaying them . <p> Daisy said , " Claude 's looking so well , Sandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone the other night . I never expected to find you at home . " <p> " Did you think I would never come back ? " <p> Daisy smiled . " If you had a husband , you could take over this business and let your daddy rest some . " <p> Sandra stiffened and held her tongue . Remarks like this were one reason she had left Cork in the first place . It was strangely disillusioning now to discover that she was virtually free from their power . <p> " I imagine I 'll be closing the funeral home after this , Daisy , " Claude said . " A little place like this is n't fancy enough to suit most folks nowadays . And some of them want to be cremated . " <p> Daisy nodded knowingly . " Bud 's sister-in-law is bad off and said she wanted to be burned and dumped in the ocean . I told Bud I would n't go all that way to Florida for the funeral if they did n't have the body . " <p> " That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to do things right anymore . I was telling Sandy about her **28;882;TOOLONG , Thomas McCain . There was a man who did things right-because he was a carpenter . And if you 're a good carpenter you 're liable to do things right , do n't you imagine ? " <p> " Dad 's threatening to give me some old furniture handed down through the generations , " Sandra explained . She thought Daisy probably was n't even hearing the discussion . As a new widow , she had more on her mind . <p> Claude said to Sandra , " I 'm going to show you this furniture right now . Come on , Daisy . You 'll appreciate this . " <p> " Where is it ? " Daisy asked . She was a small woman who did n't look strong . <p> " In the basement . " <p> " Are you sure you can get down the stairs , Dad ? " Sandra asked . <p> " Positive . " He twirled his cane playfully . <p> " I 'll stay up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daisy . " It would be disrespectful to Bud . " <p> " Here , hold on to my arm , " Sandra said to her father . His frail weight against her was shocking . <p> " You 've done him a lot of good , Sandra , " Daisy said . " I know he 's missed you . " <p> Funerals bring out the best in him , Sandra thought . In her mind was a swarm of those scavenger birds that hovered around a wolf kill in Alaska . <p> In the basement , Claude turned on lights . He asked Sandra to move aside some boxes and picture frames . The furniture was arranged in a corner , set out as if it were a furnished room . A dining table with ladder-back chairs , a sideboard , a china cabinet , a washstand , a rocking chair , a hope chest . Sandra had half-expected to see a child 's coffin , but there was n't one . The modern simplicity of the furniture surprised her . It resembled Shaker design or something in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone to some trouble to arrange it here for her benefit . And now she saw he had restored it . The finish was smooth , and the wood was oiled and fresh , not dusty . The pieces were set out carefully , and so lovingly refurbished . They seemed to be waiting for her . <p> " When did you do this , Dad ? " <p> " Oh , off and on for a few years . I needed something to do . Your mother always wanted me to fix it up . " He started toward the stairs , then turned back . " I never got over your mother , " he said . " When she died , it was like I disappeared for years . I thought nobody could see me . " <p> Sandra was startled . She did n't know what to say , but she let him hold her again . Then he turned away . She lingered in the basement while he made his way up the stairs . Daisy was beckoning him . Sandra studied the furniture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took up Thomas McCain 's calling , as if his ancestor were in fact calling him . Was there a time in life when one 's forebears suddenly reared their heads and insisted on being acknowledged ? Maybe her father and Thomas McCain had been having strange conversations . Shoptalk , she thought . The pieces were lovely , worn through time and use . <p> She could see her father at the top of the stairs , chatting with Daisy . Daisy had on an improbable pink pantsuit . She was smiling . Maybe they were laughing over old times , something funny Bud had said . Sandra could imagine Daisy and Claude becoming lovers . She remembered what her father had said about Thomas McCain and all his wives , how he quickly replaced the wives lost in childbirth , jumping straight from the burial service into the urgency of courtship . But her father had n't done that when her mother died . He was loyal to her memory . Sandra herself had n't felt the need to honor tradition and continuity . She had gone off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her so strange , suddenly  --  the way people carried on , out of necessity , and with startling zest , at the worst of times . It was the same as the stamina required by a bold adventure , a trek into the snow . <p> She heard a car crunching gravel in the lot behind the building . <p> Her father said , " Come on up , Sandy . People are coming in , and the viewing 's about to start . I need you to help me lift the lid . " <p> <p> By Bobbie Ann Mason <p>
