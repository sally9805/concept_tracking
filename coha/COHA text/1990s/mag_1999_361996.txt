If you 're looking for low familiar in a 1999 film , some concoction in which archetype meets stereotype , you might consider Drop Dead Gorgeous , a film that contains multitudes of better films in one disposable package . The other benefit of putting this instructively annoying dark comedy in a time capsule is that then no one would have to watch it . <P> A film team has come to Mount Rose , Minn. , to document its annual Sara Rose Cosmetics(R) ( c ) TM Miss Teen Princess America Pageant . And this time it 's personal .
