<p> A racial fault line ? Some parents say predominantly black schools do n't receive adequate funding , but officials deny that . <p> Melanie Johnson says she is n't at all bothered that her next-door neighbors in Clayton County are black , or that her son now attends school with more minorities than her daughter did as a student years ago . <p> All the same , Johnson , who is white , is thinking of moving out of the Lake Harbin neighborhood . Her house , worth $ 120,000 five years ago , barely came in at $ 100,000 during a recent reappraisal . The reason , Johnson said , is that many smaller homes are being built in the northeast Clayton neighborhood - and they 're being sold to minorities . <p> " It just seems to make a difference , " Johnson said , adding that she 'd like to cut her losses before her home value drops further . <p> If she leaves , she will become a factor in a rapid shift toward more minorities in Clayton County 's racial makeup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifteen years ago , white students made up 90 percent of the county 's public school enrollment ; now they make up less than half . <p> More resources for whites ? <p> The result is a school system that is much more diverse but also geographically divided . In northwest Clayton County , where many minorities have moved in and whites have left , the public schools are overwhelmingly black . But in south Clayton , many schools are still predominantly white . <p> The result , some parents maintain , is that school resources tend to follow a racial fault line , with white schools better equipped and maintained than predominantly black schools - an allegation school administrators strongly deny . <p> " I do n't think there is any such thing as separate but equal , " said Reda Brooks , a black woman who has two children at North Clayton Middle School , which is 89 percent black . " Either you do it equally or you do it separately . " <p> NAACP remains unconvinced <p> The racial issue arose recently when the county chapter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school officials of spending less money in schools that are becoming predominantly black . Clayton Superintendent Bob Livingston denies that accusation and said per-pupil spending is higher than ever . <p> But Oscar Blalock , president of the Clayton chapter of the NAACP , is not convinced . In addition to contending that schools are inadequately funded because of the dwindling percentage of whites , he also criticizes school officials for not hiring more minority faculty and staff . For example , the system has 243 black elementary school teachers , compared with 1,135 whites . At the middle and high school level , there are 52 black teachers , 434 whites . <p> Blalock acknowledges that many white teachers may relate well to minority students , but some are less effective , he said , if not totally insensitive to minority students ' needs and circumstances . <p> " There are some black kids who are able to overcome that , " he said . " But you have to be mighty strong to do that . " <p> School officials said they are hiring more black teachers and administrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added 15 black principals and assistant principals , according to Assistant Superintendent Eddie White . <p> They also point to training programs set up to help teachers and administrators communicate and work more effectively with an increasingly multicultural student body . Since 1980 , the percentage of Asian and Hispanic students in the system has quadrupled . <p> " A lot of people did n't want to change , and it has been hard for them to make the transition , " said Gail Criminger , director of staff development . " But I think we have done it in a way that has avoided a lot of conflict . " <p> A need for more schools <p> Officials say rapid growth , not racism , is straining the system , which has gained about 1,200 students per year , or roughly the equivalent of two elementary schools or one high school . <p> " Drastically , desperately , we need to build more schools , " said Assistant Superintendent David Gregory . <p> But when it comes to building and upgrading schools , the issue is green , not black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with race . It has to do with dollars . " <p> Building usually entails some form of a tax increase , however . Two options to raise money have been discussed informally . One is to increase the county 's sales tax , with the extra proceeds earmarked for schools . But the county implemented a 1 percent local-option sales tax in April . Another increase in the near future may be unlikely . <p> Another option is a bond issue , which residents have opposed in the past . In 1991 , voters soundly rejected a $ 40 million referendum for school construction . <p> Decline in quality cited <p> In the meantime , some parents , such as John Postell , contend that administrators have allowed schools to deteriorate as the proportion of blacks increased . When Postell moved to Riverdale in 1987 , he found " everything we wanted for our children " in E.W. Oliver Elementary , then about 66 percent white . <p> Now , with his daughter attending North Clayton Middle School , which is 89 percent black , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The quality of equipment , books and upkeep of the buildings have all deteriorated , " he contends . " Things that you know would be taken care of immediately at a predominantly white school . " <p> Housing , low crime a draw <p> In some ways , the demographic shift is ironic for Clayton County , which - like other suburban counties - is perceived as being safer and less congested than urban areas . Although its population has jumped , Clayton is still a relatively low-crime area . There were nine homicides in Clayton between January and mid-November . <p> Blacks moving into Clayton from Atlanta and Fulton County say they , too , want to get away from crime , crowds and other urban ills , said Yancey D. Powell , owner of a Century 21 real estate firm in College Park , whose sales for the past few years have been dominated by blacks moving into Clayton . They also are drawn by relatively affordable housing and lower property taxes . <p> " Whenever a white family moves out of the area , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black or an Oriental moving in , " Powell said , adding that most of the newcomers are working-class , first- time homebuyers . <p> White families leaving Clayton may be behind the mega-growth in the school systems of surrounding counties . In Coweta County , for example , the 9,099 white students this year represent a 61 percent increase since 1980 - but most of the boom has occurred since 1990 , said Assistant Superintendent Winston Dowdell . Henry County 's changes are even more dramatic . White students are joining its school system in record numbers , and blacks are rapidly leaving . In 1980-81 , 5,000 white students in Henry schools created a 75 percent white system . By this year , more than 12,000 white students created an 86 percent white system . Black students grew from 1,700 to 2,000 . <p> ' A short adjustment period ' <p> Whites selling their homes in Clayton often say it 's because their children are grown and the house is too big , or that they want to be closer to family and friends . <p> " Certainly they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm moving because of the people who are moving in , ' " Powell said . " Sometimes we feel that . . . but certainly , they never articulate that . " <p> But many residents welcome the diversity and are committed to remaining in the area . Clayton 's growing pains , they say , are no different from those of any other metro area having to deal with a surge in population . <p> " There 's been a short adjustment period for the diversity , " said Joy Kavin , a mother of three who has had a child in the school system since 1978 . " If there is any drawback to it , I think that there just has n't been enough time to adjust . "
