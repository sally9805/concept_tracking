As a senior editor at PEOPLE magazine , where his duties once included coordinating coverage of England 's royal family , Dick Friedman dealt with more stories about Prince Charles than about Sir Charles . But when he came to SI for a three-month stay last April as part of a program allowing various Time Inc. magazines to swap staffers , Friedman was placed in charge of our NBA playoff coverage . " I was thrown into the battle right away , " he says . " My first thought was that all those hours slumped on the couch watching games on TV were finally going to pay off . " // His creative story ideas and deft editing touch did n't hurt either . He handled the assignment so adeptly that we persuaded PEOPLE to allow him to return to SI permanently , which he did in September as our pro basketball editor , just in time to plan our NBA coverage , including the profile of New York Knick rookie Monty Williams that appears in this issue ( page 56 ) . // Friedman , 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment , first for TV Guide and later for PEOPLE . " I was probably watching  --  and this is a conservative estimate  --  20 hours a week , 50 weeks a year at one point , " he says . // Still , it 's not surprising that he adapted so quickly to SI . He penned profiles of golfer Tom Watson and shot-putter Brian Oldfield for PEOPLE , as well as a 1975 piece about a pair of promising Boston Red Sox rookies named Fred Lynn and Jim Rice . // That baseball story appealed to the New Englander in Friedman , who was born in Manhattan but grew up in Newton , Mass. , and graduated from Harvard in 1973 , all the while closely following the Red Sox , the Bruins and the Celtics . " I remember my father taking me to my first Celtic game in 1959 , when I was eight years old , " he says . " We would go to Boston Garden almost every Sunday afternoon , and the Celtics were so good that it was several years before I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has evolved from a Celtic rooter into an unbiased fan of the game in general . His home in Cranbury , N.J. , where he lives with his wife , Meryl , and their 10-year-old daughter , Leah , is strategically located . The arenas of five NBA teams  --  New York , New Jersey , Philadelphia , Washington and Boston  --  are a train ride away . The Friedmans ' 15th wedding anniversary was Nov. 4 , the night the 1994-95 NBA season opened . The Knicks were playing the Celtics in Boston Garden , and although Dick was able to resist the temptation to go to the game , it was harder to fight the urge to watch it on TV . " My wife  --  make that my highly understanding wife  --  agreed to postpone our anniversary dinner until the next night , " he says , " so I could watch the game . " // Friedman 's own basketball career did n't go beyond intramurals at Harvard . At 5 ' 3 " , he was no Muggsy Bogues , but " I could hit an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem was I could n't defend , jump , penetrate or handle the ball . " // None of that really matters . Having seen what Friedman can do when he 's thrown into the game , we still want him on our team .
