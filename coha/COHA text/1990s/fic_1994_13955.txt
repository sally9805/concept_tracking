Ginger and Don are in bed , propped up on their respective pillows . Reading . GINGER How 's your mother feeling ? Did you talk to her today ? ( Don does n't answer . She closes her book . ) I 'm going downstairs . Do you want anything ? ( She sits up . ) Like a glass of water or anything ? ( She looks over at him . ) Don ? DON I said " no . " GINGER You did ? DON There 's something the matter with your hearing , have you noticed ? Especially on the phone . ( Imitating her . ) What ? What ? GINGER My hearing ? DON Your hearing . Do n't stay up too late . How late were you up last night ? GINGER I do n't know . Three . DON Oh . If you 'll give me the registration for the Volvo , I 'll take it out with me tomorrow and put it on . GINGER You 're going to the country tomorrow ? DON I told you that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll be back by eight . GINGER You told me you were going to the country ? What is tomorrow ? DON Tuesday . Yes . I told you . I rented a workshop . GINGER A workshop ? DON Yes . If you will remember our discussion last weekend , I can either stop making tables altogether , or just stop making them in the house . So I rented a workshop . GINGER It was n't about the tables . It was about the time you spend making the tables . It was about how I do n't see you . About how the first thing you do when we get out to the house is leave . DON I 'm not leaving , Ginger . I 'm getting the mail . GINGER Checking on the boat . Going to the hardware store . The liquor store . The bait store . Buying magazines . Getting the cars washed , the oil changed , the tanks filled , the mats cleaned . Buying trash bags . Lightbulbs . Tape . Dog food . Bird food . Fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? GINGER I do n't know , Don . DON If you did n't want any animals , you should 've told the kids no . GINGER That would have been popular . DON Since when did you worry about being popular ? GINGER What are you going to do in your shop ? DON Make tables . GINGER To sell ? DON No , not to sell . It would be really stupid to take the one thing I really enjoy doing , and turn it into work . GINGER But your tables are beautiful . People love them . You should take one out to Ralph Lauren and  --  DON Just stop it , Ginger . O.K. ? I 'm never going to make any more money than I do right now . And I 'm never going to like what I do . And if that means I 'm never going to be good enough for you , then that 's just too bad . This is who I am . And this is who you married . GINGER I 'm sorry . It 's just I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would make my life more interesting to you . I am not a character in your new novel . I 'm your husband . Cut me some slack . She gets out of the bed , puts on her slippers and robe . Don looks up . p. 3 DON Would you bring me a glass of water when you come up ? GINGER I could be a while . Do you want me to bring it up right now ? DON That would be great . Thanks . GINGER You 're going to move all your equipment into this shop ? DON I have to have a place to go , Ginger . What do you want me to do , hang around the house all weekend and watch you read ? GINGER Do you want ice in your water ? DON That would be great . Thanks . I love you . GINGER I love you too . Goodnight . ( She goes out the door. ) @x Ginger sits at a table for two in a popular lunch spot . This is actually a series of lunches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her friends rotate into the lunch one at a time , somehow . This change of companions may occur while Ginger looks at the menu , unfolds her napkin , talks to the waiter , or it may be handled with lighting . What is important is that while Ginger does notice that her friends come and go , she seems to accept that this is how things are . Maria approaches . She is a real estate broker . MARIA Ginger , hi . Sorry I 'm late . The traffic is terrible . GINGER It 's O.K. I just got here . You look terrific . MARIA What a great little place . How did you know about it ? GINGER I 'm going to an ear doctor in this neighborhood . MARIA ( Looking at the menu . ) Nothing serious , I hope . GINGER Well . We still do n't quite know what it is . My left ear keeps plugging up , like I have water in it from swimming . It does n't actually hurt , it just makes me feel a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further away . If I get any further away , sooner or later , someone will realize I 'm actually gone . Lights go out on Maria and come up on Ginger 's best friend , Sue . p. 5 SUE This day . Lord . Oh well . What 's good ? GINGER I like the omelets . You know , eggs in time of stress . SUE ( Reaching in her bag . ) Oh , here . I brought you the new Anna Quindlen . How 's your book coming ? GINGER Good . God knows who 's going to read it , but hey . SUE What do you mean ? Everyone who reads will read it . How close are you ? GINGER Actually , I 'm stuck . I ca n't seem to figure out whether what she should SUE ( Seeing the waiter . ) Know what you want ? GINGER ( Looking up as if at the waiter . ) Swiss and bacon , I think . And a small salad . And some juice . Can you make a mix of orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up on Ginger 's friend , Connie , a nurse . CONNIE Everything O.K. at home ? GINGER The kids are good . Don 's good . Except he thinks he 's too fat . ( She has to laugh . ) I had this weird thought the other day about how different the world would have been if Darwin had called it , " The Survival of the Fattest. " p. 6 CONNIE You 're so funny . GINGER But then I thought , maybe that 's why diets do n't work . CONNIE None of them work . GINGER Well , what if the reason they do n't work is that diets are about individuals , you know , what individuals want . Whereas what the species wants is for people to have enough fat on them to survive . And the more fat you have , the better your chances are of survival . So even though you want to be thin , your body takes its direction from the species , and the species says eat . You know ? CONNIE The bread looks great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the species is really in charge of everything ? What if the things we think we need , love and children and a place to live , are really just things the species needs , to keep itself going ? But the only way the species can get these things is to trick us , with hormones mainly , into thinking we need them . MARIA Well , I know what I need . A new coat . I 've looked all over town , and I ca n't find what I want . Ginger knows she 's said too much , and tries to take a lighter approach . GINGER Well , the species would certainly like for you to be warm . What are you looking for ? p. 7 MARIA Oh , you know , black , soft , something I can wear everywhere . GINGER Like something a species would put on a big black Lab . MARIA Exactly . GINGER Or a lot of little rabbits . MARIA You 're so funny . GINGER You 'll find it . Did you try Bergdorf 's ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try this dill butter . Now tell me . What 's the new book about ? Anybody I know ? GINGER No , no . It 's just about some people who ca n't figure out why they have the lives they have . Not that they do n't like their lives , just that the thrill that made them choose this particular man , or this particular kind of work , they do n't feel that thrill any more . All they feel is guilt that they 're not taking good enough care of them . MARIA Oh good . The food is here . Yours looks wonderful . GINGER What to trade ? MARIA No , no . GINGER I mean , maybe the reason people do n't change more than they do , is the species likes for you to stay put . So . After it gets your children out of you , the species just cuts you loose . And without the species to tell you what you want , you really do n't want anything . p. 8 MARIA ( To the waiter . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry . I should know not to talk about something before it 's finished . It 's just well , did you ever look at your family and think , " Who are these people ? " SUE But you love your family . GINGER I know . My work too . I do n't know what it is . SUE Do you believe this Michael Jackson thing ? GINGER I know . It 's crazy . But obviously , the species does n't want us to know it controls us like this . Because nobody will talk about this with me . Nobody . SUE How 's your ear doing ? GINGER About the same . Thanks for asking , though . I 'm seeing this new doctor Mary told me about tomorrow . Are you reading anything ? SUE Just Anna Karenina . Again . GINGER Well . We all know what that means . A moment . SUE You ? GINGER The new Marquez is good . The last story is unbelievable . About three pages in , I got this incredible sense of dread about what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever read . And all I wanted to do was turn to the last page to see if I was right . My hand actually went up to turn to the end , and I literally had to put my hand under the covers to keep reading the page I was on . You have to get it . p. 9 CONNIE And what happened ? You can tell me . You know I wo n't read it . GINGER Oh nothing . Just this amazing girl died , and this boy she was so in love with did n't know about it til after she was buried . CONNIE How are the kids ? GINGER They 're good . CONNIE What any dessert ? GINGER Does anybody ever ask you a personal question ? SUE What do you mean , personal ? GINGER Something they 're not supposed to ask . Something you 'd tell them if they asked , but they do n't ask . SUE I do n't think so . GINGER But why is that ? Does the species not want us to get personal , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go around tearing things up ? SUE You do n't think people know how they feel ? GINGER I do n't . I think after a certain point , people put these huge sections of their lives on auto , you know . Like there 's this big switchboard and people go through and ( Mimes flipping switches. ) this is my family , and this is where I live , and this is what I do , and this is what I eat , and these are the people I have lunch with , and these are the books I read , and this is my radio station , and here 's what I think about this and this and this . And they do n't think about it any more . So they never try anything else . p. 10 SUE But if you know you like something , why should you try something else ? GINGER Because if you do n't , then all you are is comfortable . Is that what we 're doing here , trying to get comfortable ? Do you think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then what would you do ? Go to sleep ? Die ? What ? SUE Would you like to come to the gym with me some day ? GINGER You do n't feel silly exercising with all those young people ? SUE I think they 're cute , actually . GINGER Anyone in particular ? SUE I wish . It 's really been a long time since I 've been attracted to anybody . It used to happen all the time . GINGER I Know . CONNIE Like in college . GINGER It 's not us , I can tell you that . MARIA Oh good . GINGER It 's the species . It does n't need us to find mates any more , so it just does n't turn us on to anybody . Or them to us . MARIA I ca n't believe how cold it is out there . I do n't know what I would 've done if I had n't found my coat . I love my new coat . So what are you up to ? p. 11 GINGER I 'm taking a painting class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting . GINGER Maybe I 'm not . Maybe the species just needs me to find some little hobby so I 'll stay out of the way til I die . You know , so it can save all the jobs for the people who are having babies . SUE How 's Don ? GINGER He 's good . He 's rented a little woodworking shop in the country . SUE Is he any good at it ? GINGER No . He says it soothes him . SUE How 's your ear ? GINGER It 's O.K. I can hear enough . SUE You seem a little down . GINGER Put your money away . I 've got it . SUE ( Getting up . ) Did you tell me what your new book is about ? GINGER Yes , but I gave up on it . Just threw it away . I 've never done that before . SUE You 're not working on anything ? GINGER No , I am . It 's an old idea , actually . But I 'm thinking I might know how to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about pleasure . p. 12 SUE ( Stricken . ) Pleasure ? What 's that ? CONNIE Do you mean erotic pleasure , or like cooking ? MARIA Well . I ca n't wait to read it . Thanks for lunch . SUE Pleasure ? Really ? Are you serious ? GINGER ( With a smile . ) I could be . ( A moment . ) I know . ( A smile. ) @x Lights come up on a peaceful woman sitting in a chair . This woman need not leave the stage as the piece continues . Lights can simply go out on her . ANNIE Ginger was a happy child . So happy . Happy all the time . Singing and dancing and playing by herself . I kept telling her how nice it was outside , but I have to admit it was sweet that she wanted to stay down in the basement with me . None of the other neighborhood children were well good enough to play with her , really , so I would iron and she would play school , making little books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was writing , scribbling on the paper and then hiding her little messages behind the runner on the stairs . She did n't know I knew , but I did . But I did n't read them . ( A moment . ) If she had wanted me to know what she thought , she would 've just told me . A moment . Don enters the area defined by Annie . He is reading a magazine . ANNIE Her husband , Don , is it 's hard to say . I did n't know him very well . Don is not talking to Annie , but he is not unaware of her presence. @x Curtain rises on a beautiful outdoor deck , furnished comfortably , but exquisitely . Hanging baskets of fuschia and ivy are everywhere . It is just dawn . And it looks like it 's going to be a stunning day . The air will be cool and clear , and the sun will be warm . A eucalyptus-scented candle is burning . It is a safe world . Ginger enters from the house , closing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wears a loose pair of while silk pajamas , over which she wears an unbelted kimono . On her feet are Chanel-type bedroom slippers . She puts down her hairbrush , takes her yoga mat from the baker 's rack in the corner , unfolds it and places it on the deck . She takes off her kimono and slippers , then walks to the tape player in the corner , inserts a tape and pushes Play . As the New Age music of the tape begins , Ginger stands on the mat , relaxed and serene , and rolls her head slowly from side to side . VOICE OF THE SWAMI The chariot of the mind is drawn by wild horses . These horses have to be tamed . She brings her hands into the prayer pose . VOICE OF THE SWAMI Standing erect , feet together , bring your hands in front of your chest in the prayer pose . Keeping your body completely still , breathe slowly through the nostrils . Bring your mind into a state of quiet awareness , concentrating only on your breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A moment . ) And now , when you next exhale , join me in the Salutation to the Sun . Ginger now performs the Salutation to the Sun chanting with the Swami . p. 16 GINGER AND THE SWAMI 'S VOICE Om Namo SuryayaOm Namo BhaskrayaOm Namo Divaya James , a lean , handsome , mysterious man comes up the steps , wearing loose pants , but no shirt , Ginger bows to him , and he to her . He might be a wizard . GINGER AND JAMES Namaste . GINGER AND THE SWAMI 'S VOICE Om Namo TejayaOm Namo Prkashaya James does a few stretches , then joins Ginger for the second repetition of the Salutation to the Sun , chanting with her . She is happy to see him , but not surprised . GINGER , JAMES , AND SWAMI 'S VOICE Om Namo SuryayaOm Namo BhaskrayaOm Namo DivayaOm Namo TejayaOm Namo Prkashaya Ginger and James smile comfortably as the Swami 's voice on tape begins again . Something about the voice sounds slightly different . VOICE OF THE SWAMI The goal of tantric yoga is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a transcendent sensual meditation , leading to a union that transcends the boundaries of everyday experience . The glass door slides opens and Ginger 's daughter , Beth , sticks her head out . She does n't seem to see James . p. 17 BETH Mom ? GINGER Right here . BETH O.K. The girl , apparently happy just to know where Ginger is , closes the door and the voice on the tape comes back up . VOICE OF THE SWAMI You begin by sitting quietly together , ( Ginger and the man sit. ) meditating or praying or simply opening to the sounds around you . Ginger and James follow the Swami 's instructions . VOICE OF THE SWAMI As you embrace and kiss , align your throats , hearts and bodies , and breathe as one . In and out . Easily . Freely . Now , begin to touch one another with utmost sensitivity . Reveal to each other those places where you feel fear or shame . The door opens and Ginger 's son sticks his head out . He does n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARLIE What 's today ? GINGER Thursday . CHARLIE Damn . He leaves quickly , as though it being Thursday means he has to do something right away . The Swami 's voice continues on the tape . p. 18 VOICE OF THE SWAMI Return to the butterfly pose and sit calmly for a moment , feeling centered and at peace . Ginger and James sit up now , facing each other in the butterfly pose . VOICE OF THE SWAMI Today you will learn the Set of Nines . In which you will discover a powerful current of energy connecting you at the genitals , rising up to the heart , bridging the space between you , and dropping back to the genitals again . They are amused . GINGER AND JAMES O.K. VOICE OF THE SWAMI As you listen to the instructions , place your hands on your breasts in order to feel the heat from your hands entering the skin . The door opens again and Ginger 's husband , Don , comes out . He does n't seem to see the man lying next to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost seven . GINGER Thanks . Don goes back inside as the Swami 's voice begins again . James may reach across to Ginger and take her hands in his . VOICE OF THE SWAMI To begin the Set of Nines , the man enters the woman with nine shallow thrusts . He withdraws and pauses before entering again , this time for eight shallow thrusts followed by one deep thrust . p. 19 JAMES I think I know where this is going . But it sounds so good to Ginger that she ca n't really respond . VOICE OF THE SWAMI Again he withdraws , pulling back briefly from the edge of orgasm . BETH 'S VOICE O.S. ( Calling out . ) Mom ? VOICE OF THE SWAMI Now the man takes seven shallow thrusts and two deep thrusts , and withdraws . James nods and begins to speak with the Swami . JAMES AND SWAMI 'S VOICE Six shallow , three deep , withdraw ; five shallow , four deep , withdraw ; four shallow , five deep , withdraw ; three shallow , six deep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom ! JAMES ( To Ginger . ) Do you want to stop ? GINGER No . JAMES AND SWAMI 'S VOICE Two shallow , seven deep , withdraw . One shallow , eight deep , . withdraw DON 'S VOICE O.S. ( Calling out . ) Ginger ! VOICE OF THE SWAMI Until GINGER ( Calling to them . ) Just a minute ! p. 20 SWAMI 'S VOICE Until the man brings his lover to orgasm with nine deep thrusting strokes . There is a silence . GINGER Probably worth a try . JAMES I 'm in . And after a moment , James helps Ginger stand up , and facing each other once again , they assume the prayer pose as the Swami signs off . VOICE OF THE SWAMI O Life-giving Sun , offspring of the Lord of Creation , Don enters , but waits through the Swami 's blessing . Ginger joins in with the Swami . GINGER AND THE SWAMI 'S VOICE  --  let me behold thy radiant form , that I may realize that the Spirit far away within thee , is my Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other as before . GINGER AND JAMES Namaste . James leaves and Don starts talking as Ginger folds up her mat and blows out the candle . DON Are we still on with Jerry and Sue tonight ? GINGER Yes , but I have n't talked to her yet , so I do n't know what we 're doing . DON Just so it 's not Mexican . GINGER O. K. p. 21 DON And for God 's sake , not at their house . GINGER Are you going to be this way tonight ? DON What way ? GINGER If you do n't like them , why do n't you just say you never want to see them again ? DON Because it would n't do any good . GINGER Don . They 're the only friends we have . DON They 're not my friends . GINGER They could be . DON Oh sure . If I liked them they could . If I were somebody else who liked them . Well , believe me , if I could be somebody else , I would . GINGER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . What difference does it make ? I ca n't be anybody else , can I ? So why should we talk about who , exactly , I could never be ? GINGER Because I want to know . Who is it ? DON I do n't know . ( A wild idea . ) Mohammed Ali . GINGER Please . DON Or you . GINGER Me ? p. 22 DON Of course you . Is n't it everybody 's dream , to make a living by not going to work ? GINGER Writing is work . DON Come on . You do n't work the hours lawyers work . Or sales girls even . You talk on the phone , and have lunch with your friends . GINGER That 's not all I do . DON Are we still on with Jerry and Sue tonight ? This seems familiar to Ginger , like maybe she 's had this conversation before , but maybe not , so she continues bravely on . GINGER Yes , but I forget what we 're doing . DON Just so it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking . DON Oh for Christ 's sake . You ca n't even sit down in their house without some bird flying over your head , or some handicapped cat jumping in your lap . GINGER Why do you have to be this way ? They have pets because they ca n't have children . She 's my oldest friend . DON She 's not older than I am . Nobody is older than I am . I 've asked you not to say " old . " GINGER Don , please . DON I 'm sorry , honey . I 'll see you tonight . Are we still on with Jerry and Sue ? p. 23 GINGER We 're going to that Chinese place you like . DON Does Jerry have to come ? GINGER He 's Sue 's husband ! DON But they 're so terrible to each other . If I 'm going to watch a fight , I 'd rather see one on TV . Why do n't you girls just go out by yourselves ? GINGER Could you pick up the dry cleaning ? DON No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm having supper with Sue . DON Great . There 's a fight on TV I want to watch . GINGER Bye , hon. He kisses her on the cheek and leaves . The son comes by and kisses her . CHARLIE Mom ! GINGER Charlie ! CHARLIE Your hair looks funny . The daughter runs to catch up to him . She poses for Ginger . BETH Mom ? GINGER ( Still thinking there 's hope . ) Beth ! BETH How do I look ? GINGER Great . You look great . Ginger remains on the stage. @x Lights come back up on Annie still sitting in her chair . ANNIE I do n't know why these girls today wait so long to have their children . Why if Ginger had had hers when I told her to , they 'd be so much older by now . They 'd be in college . They might even have jobs . At the very least they would n't still be children . But she said no . She had plenty of time to have children . Girls that age think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But at least she had her children . A girl and a boy . And I have to say , in spite of everything , she was a perfect mother . Ginger approaches Annie and responds . GINGER That 's not true . ANNIE She was a perfect daughter . GINGER There 's no such thing as perfect . ANNIE Everything you do is perfect ! GINGER It is not ! I do n't even want it to be . I 'm not trying to live a perfect life . ANNIE You could . GINGER Stop it . Just stop it . ANNIE What do you want , my permission not to live a perfect life ? My congratulations on not living a perfect life ? Well , listen here , young lady . If you 're not living a perfect life , I do n't want to hear about it . p. 25 GINGER What do you want to hear about ? How I 'm planning the perfect Christmas ? Perfect for whom ? The whole purpose of perfect is to make us feel bad . Like we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go find whoever this is who 's measuring us all the time , and take away their goddamn stick ? ANNIE Their stick ? GINGER ( Really irritated now . ) Their measuring stick . You know , the one that 's marked Really Bad , Bad . Not Good , Not Good Enough , Perfect . It 's killing us . ( A small smile . ) I found that once I quit trying to put on the perfect outfit , ( A moment . ) I could actually get dressed . ANNIE The last Christmas I spent with you was perfect . GINGER I 'm glad you thought so . ANNIE You did n't . GINGER Christmas to me feels like a happiness test . One I have failed for years now . ANNIE What is the matter with you today ? GINGER You think it 's just today ? ANNIE Are you sick ? You seem a little flushed . Ginger suddenly wishes her mother would understand , is suddenly willing to try . p. 26 GINGER I ca n't seem to fit in anywhere . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules because I told them to you . You just broke the rules . GINGER No , I did n't . ANNIE You talked to strangers . Did n't you ? James appears on the other side of the stage , cleaning his sax . GINGER That was a real rule ? ANNIE Very . Annie exits . Sue appears . SUE Are you seeing someone ? I think you 're seeing someone . GINGER No . I 'm not . SUE Then why do you look so happy ? GINGER I 'm flirting with someone . But he started it . SUE Is he married ? GINGER No . SUE How long has he not been married ? GINGER Stop it . SUE How long has he not been married ? GINGER Two years . SUE O.K. That 's long enough . Does he have children ? p. 27 GINGER They live with their mother . SUE What does he do ? GINGER He plays the sax . SUE ( Suddenly very sober . ) How well does he play the sax ? GINGER Like a dream . SUE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh sure . GINGER Sue . I told you . We 're flirting . Oh , I do n't know . What do I do ? SUE Well . I do n't think you have to stop flirting . Sue exits . Ginger picks up the phone on her desk , and hears the message on James 's machine . JAMES Hi . This is James . You can leave me a message at the tone , or you can come to Mabel 's and buy me a drink between sets . Up to you . Bye . GINGER ( Leaving him a message . ) James . My name is Ginger Andrews . My agent said you would be willing to talk to me about Morocco . About oases , actually , for a book I 'm thinking about . Well , it 's about pleasure in general , but he seemed to think you were my best bet . So . My number is  --  ( A moment . ) Why do I think you do n't return calls ? O.K. I 'll come find you at Mabel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red hair and a notebook . Bye . James begins to play the saxophone . Lights down on Annie 's area. @x Ginger is working at her computer . Don appears . GINGER Hi . She continues to type . DON Hi . Ginger looks up while typing a sentence . GINGER Yes ? DON If you 'd had an affair , would you have told me ? GINGER You think I 'm having an affair ? DON That 's not what I asked . I asked GINGER if I had had an affair , would I have told you . DON Yes . GINGER I do n't think so , Don . No . Probably not . DON Right . GINGER Why would I ? DON No . That seems right to me too . I was just checking . I 'll see you later . He starts to leave . GINGER You do n't want to know ? DON I do n't want to look stupid . GINGER Why would my having an affair make you look stupid ? p. 30 DON Because it would mean I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nothing to do with you . DON That ca n't be true . GINGER It 's not . DON Would they have anything to do with the fact that we do n't have sex ? GINGER No . DON Really ? GINGER No . DON So they do . GINGER They could . DON That ca n't be all of it though . Do n't tell me . You 're afraid of getting old . GINGER I 'm not getting old . DON I did n't say you were . GINGER No . I 'm not . I 'm not getting old . I thought I would by now . But I 'm not . DON You do n't think you 're immortal . GINGER No . Thanks , though . DON But would n't having affairs make you feel bad ? GINGER I would n't have them if they made me feel bad . DON O.K. They 'd make you feel great . Then what ? p. 31 GINGER Then I would come home , I guess . DON But what if I found out ? What if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them ? GINGER I would try to explain , I guess . DON And what if I left you because of it ? GINGER Then you would be gone . DON But I could take the children way . Accuse you of being an unfit mother  --  GINGER I 'm a great mother . DON  --  and take the children away . GINGER A lot of things could take my children away , Don . Drugs , or TV , or a terrible disease , or bad luck with a car or , God , what if they grew up ? DON Would you talk to your lovers ? GINGER Yes , Don Lovers like to be talked to . ( A moment . ) Some more than others , of course . DON And what would you talk about ? GINGER About ourselves , mainly . About when we first knew we were going to make love , and how long we waited , and how it was n't fair that we could n't see each other whenever we wanted . DON And what would they say ? Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don . They would say that I was beautiful . The phone rings . GINGER ( Picks it up . ) Hello ? Don walks out of the room , as Ginger erases something on the computer . GINGER Hi Sue . ( Listens . ) I 'm just working . No . It 's O.K. ( Listens . ) I do n't know what it is . Maybe it 's not even a book . Maybe it 's a nervous breakdown . ( Then quickly . ) It 's a joke , Sue . I 'm fine . I 'm obsessed . I do n't want to be here . ( Changing the subject . ) So . Where shall we eat tonight ? Is Jerry coming ? ( Listens . ) No , no . Don 's still in Chicago . Yeah . So first we 'll go look for your coat and then we 'll decide where to eat . If we find something at Barney 's we can just eat there . O.K. Say six-thirty ? ( Listens . ) Very funny . See you then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soda and studies the computer screen . GINGER About when we first knew we were going to make love , and how long we ( Changes a word. ) resisted , and how it was n't fair we could n't see each other whenever we wanted . Don walks back in. p. 33 DON And what would they say ? Would they ask about me ? GINGER No , Don . They would say that I was beautiful . The phone rings . GINGER Hello . Ginger practically swears into the phone hearing who it is . GINGER I 'm sorry . Was I supposed to call you ? ( Listens . ) Oh good . O.K. No . I have n't thought about it . I agree to phone interviews and then I forget to write them down , so Yes . I remember that it was just one question . I just do n't remember what that question was , exactly . ( Listens . ) Oh that 's right . Of course . ( Stating her answer . ) What is most helpful for writers to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to bed with them . ( She laughs . ) No . That 's the real answer . ( A moment . ) You 're welcome . Yes , please . Send me a copy . Ginger hangs up the phone . GINGER ( Quickly . ) Bullshit , bullshit , bullshit . Ginger unwraps a stick of gum . She looks up and sees Don standing there . p. 34 DON Surprise ! GINGER Don ! DON I 'm early . GINGER Why did n't you call ? DON This is my home . Do I have to call before I come over ? GINGER What 's up ? DON I read this new whatever this thing is that you 're writing . About having these affairs . Is this me , this Ron character ? GINGER Where did you find it ? DON On your desk . GINGER I did n't leave it on my desk . DON O.K. It was under a big stack of papers on the floor . But I found it . So you must have meant for me to find it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've had affairs ? GINGER It 's not about me . It 's about  --  DON Do n't insult me , Ginger . GINGER It does n't say she 's had affairs . Just that she 's  --  DON Thinking about it ? GINGER Yes . She , the main character , Trudy , is thinking about it . p. 35 DON And you 're not . GINGER Are you asking me if I 'm having an affair ? DON ( After a moment . ) No . GINGER ( After a moment . ) Is there anything else you do n't want to know ? DON Not that I can think of . No . GINGER I 'm going to keep working a little longer , I think . DON I 'm going to bed . GINGER All right . DON Goodnight , hon. GINGER Goodnight . Don turns to leave , then turns back . DON I just want you to know that if anything ever happens to you , if you die the first thing I 'm going to do , after I stop crying , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written . Not just your short stories and books , but your notes , your journals , your letters everything you 've ever written . Ginger nods and Don leaves . She waits a moment , then turns back to the computer and types . GINGER " Ron turned away . " She looks up at the door , as though waiting for him to come back in. p. 36 GINGER " Ron turned away , took one step , and fell into the bottomless pit . " Then going on , apparently unable to stop herself , speaking as though reading to a child . GINGER " Poor Ron . Did n't he see the pit ? Had n't she told him there was a pit ? Had n't she told him how every day she had to work so hard not to fall into that pit ? Well , he should 've listened to her . The pit is there , all right . Only now , it has a man in it . And he is really pissed off . " ( A smile . ) Will Ron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her study ? Tune in tomorrow for another episode of ( Her anger coming through. ) @x The phone rings again . GINGER Hello . She hears the voice , recognizes who it is , is thrilled to hear it 's him , but lowers her voice . GINGER Oh hi ! Where are you , are you there ? I was afraid you would n't get in . ( Listens . ) You do ? ( Listens in rapture . ) I 'm sorry . Maybe I did n't hear that right . ( Having heard it perfectly . ) Would you say that again ? ( Listens . ) I have missed you so much . I 've never missed anybody like this . It 's getting to where seeing you is just some kind of break between these bouts of missing you . So ? Where shall we meet ? She listens . Trying not to convey her disappointment . GINGER Oh . All right . No , no . You sound exhausted . It would be a little tricky to get out of here anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Goodnight , sweetie . She hangs up the phone. @x Ginger walks into a Spy Shop . There are several other shoppers . A clerk comes up to her . He is dressed very neatly , and though he is probably a neo-Nazi , he tries to conceal that . CLERK May I help you ? GINGER Yes . ( She is very nervous . ) I was just walking by , and saw the lie detection phone in the window and I  --  CLERK Certainly . ( Getting it out of the case . ) What kind of business are you in ? GINGER It 's very small . We  --  CLERK You 'll be pleased with this . It 's the top of the line in vocal stress measurement devices . Someone is lying to you ? He looks up , as though he must maintain a constant surveillance over the front door . GINGER I do n't know . CLERK What security measures do you currently employ ? GINGER ( A moment . ) None . He shakes his head reprovingly , looking around the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to know is that there 's no such thing as perfect security . p. 39 GINGER I wondered . CLERK There is only effective security . GINGER That might be enough . CLERK We 'll talk about that later . Now . ( Showing her the phone . ) When a subject is under emotional stress , his vocal chords will , as you have no doubt noticed , tremble . GINGER ( After a moment . ) Quiver . Yes . CLERK ( A moment . ) The Model 862 gives you a baseline readout here for the subject 's normal voice , usually somewhere around 20 . GINGER And I establish this baseline by  --  CLERK By first asking questions the subject would have no reason to lie about , such as GINGER What day is this , what year is this CLERK Exactly . Then once you have a baseline , any response which produces a reading significantly higher than the baseline , is clearly a lie . I did n't get your name . GINGER Trudy . Trudy Blue . CLERK Bill Evans . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseline . After that , you simply ask what it is you really want to know . What kind of business did you say you were in ? p. 40 GINGER I did n't . CLERK Please . Trudy . Come with me . I have something I want to show you . Ginger follows him to another room . CLERK This is better . In this area , nothing we say can be heard by anyone else in the store . GINGER Really ? CLERK Try it . Scream if you want . Ginger looks around , then screams GINGER Help ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! No one turns around . She smiles . GINGER That 's good . And we ca n't hear them either . That 's really good . How do you do it ? CLERK It 's our business , Trudy . Now Let 's talk about the chances of your private information falling into the wrong hands . GINGER All right . CLERK Do you conduct sensitive discussions in your office ? GINGER I do . Yes . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone , I trust . ( She indicates yes . ) Not in your car too . ( She indicates yes . ) In public ? p. 41 GINGER I 'm sorry . CLERK ( Stunned . ) Trudy , if this information were used to your disadvantage , would n't the consequences be inconvenient ? GINGER I 'm sorry . CLERK Do n't apologize . Just take care of it . I 'm sorry . ( Realizing he went too far . ) That 's why you 're here , is n't it ? GINGER Can I try the phone ? CLERK ( He begins to plug things in . ) Of course . What makes you think they 're lying to you ? GINGER There 's nothing in particular . It 's just  --  CLERK They usually are . Go ahead . Dial the number . The phone rings . Ginger picks it up . But instead of the clerk on the phone , we hear James 's voice . The clerk is monitoring over a set of earphones , as if from a surveillance van . James picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAMES What 's up ? You do n't sound like yourself . GINGER I do n't feel like myself either . The clerk signals to begin the baseline check . Ginger remembers what she 's doing . James enters , taking his saxophone out of its case . p. 42 GINGER What day is this ? JAMES Thursday . The clerk nods . James wipes off the sax . GINGER The tenth , the eleventh ? JAMES The tenth . This is a terrible connection . Why do n't I call you back on  --  GINGER No . You ca n't . I 'm trying out phones . Only I realized I could n't know what they sounded like unless I called somebody . I hope I 'm not interrupting anything . JAMES No , no . The clerk indicates this may be a lie . GINGER Well , I 'll let you go then  --  The clerk indicates she must keep talking . JAMES Any chance we can get together later ? GINGER About five I could . JAMES Is six too late ? There 's something I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie . Suddenly , Ginger is nervous . JAMES I miss you , Ginny . The clerk indicates this is the truth . She is very relieved . GINGER I miss you too . I 'll see you at six . p. 43 JAMES Six it is . Same place . I love you . GINGER I love you too . JAMES Bye . Ginger hears the click then looks at the phone . The clerk unplugs the telephone and looks at her . She did not look at the clerk for affirmation that James loves her . CLERK So it 's personal . GINGER ( Watching James . ) Deeply . CLERK Why do n't I come to your office tomorrow and do a silent sweep , just so we know what we 're up against ? Or if you ca n't wait that long , I could lease you a jammer to take home with you right now . GINGER No , I think I know what to do . CLERK No . You do n't . You 're an amateur . I like you , Trudy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these days . GINGER No . Neither do I Thank you very much . Ginger sees James waiting for her at a table . She moves toward him and starts to speak , but lights come up on Annie first and she speaks .
