<p> The Chicago Sun-Times takes the facile road in its Aug. 4 editorial " Data on Public Bonds Ought to Be Available , " calling for more paperwork by state and local governments as a protection against fraud in selling debt to investors . <p> Just what injuries have state and local governments inflicted on investors that are so grievous they must be redressed with oversight by a Washington bureaucrat ? If more than two public sector-issuers have defaulted or defrauded their customers in the last few years , they have escaped my notice . <p> And how would the Sun-Times rate the track record of financial regulators in such areas as savings and loan associations , initial public hearings , small-business franchising and private-sector junk bonds ? <p> The Beltway branch of regulation in those areas is hardly likely to improve the confidence of municipal-bond investors . They certainly show no evidence of demanding regulation . Indeed , they 've confidently flocked to the municipal bond market in record numbers in the last three years without any oversight by a twentysomething regulator at the SEC . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government would add to the cost of borrowing by state and local governments , restrict local governments ' choices in investment vehicles and curtail the options available to investors . Dan Miller , publisher/vice president , City &; State magazine Negotiation Sham <p> I understand that the negotiations to resolve the Haitian crisis have become a sham and a farce . <p> In this second round of negotiations , the supporters of the 1991 coup against exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide signed an agreement and by July 3 were on their way home before Aristide 's team had approved it . <p> Aristide and his people were forced to accept it as a fait accompli . The United States is part of the United Nations team that is ostensibly mediating this matter . <p> But apparently the United States and the coup leaders are steering events to a speedy solution . <p> The failures of such an accord are clear . They lift the UN/OAS embargo before it bites . It leaves Raoul Cedras , a principal coup leader , retiring from the army with a pension , even though he presided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a possible blanket amnesty being extended to all coup participants , and the future role of the chief of police is left ambiguous . <p> Nor does this second agreement purge the legislature of the 13 members selected in the January , 1993 , election called by the military . This assures a dependable pro-military majority . <p> To force Aristide back to Haiti under these terms of agreement hardly seems fair . I had hopes that this administration would operate differently . Grace Wise , La Grange Misleading Comparison <p> In your article Aug. 5 ( " Fee Plan Is No Walk in the Park , " news story ) on the Chicago Park District golf course , General Supt. Forrest Claypool said he would like to double the rates , using as his guide the rates at the Silver Lakes and Glencoe Club golf courses . This is like comparing apples to oranges . <p> The two courses mentioned are owned privately and pay all costs for maintaining their facilities , including taxes . <p> In contrast , the Chicago public courses are owned and maintained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes toward the cost of these courses . <p> Further , if he thinks that there is an exodus when the CTA raises fares , wait until he sees what happens to the attendance at the courses . He will lose 60 percent of the present players . Richard Ellis , West Lawn Focus on Priorities <p> The $ 166 million budget of the National Endowment for the Arts and its cut from $ 175 million has inspired impassioned editorials in the past few weeks . All of these editorials have focused on the morality of " art " such as a crucifix in urine or the propriety of subsidizing these artists and their projects with federal tax money . <p> In my opinion , there is a much more important and obvious issue - priorities . As long as research is needed to save children from dying from disease and as long as the streets are not safe because we can not afford enough prison space , then we can not spend tax funds on art projects regardless of whether they are obscene . The answer is not more taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts . In fact , I believe that it is in artistic expression that mankind reaches its highest level ; however , it should be privately funded . When people are no longer dying from cancer and when all Americans have a job and a home , then our humanely set priorities may allow us to finance art . Frank Edward Gardner , vice president Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago Upsetting Photo <p> In the Food section June 24 , there was a full-color picture of a picnic table draped with the American flag and dishes of food were on top of the flag . <p> As a Korean veteran , I am quite upset at the American flag being used as a tablecloth , especially the day before the anniversary of the start of the Korean War . I fly my flag proudly in front of my house to honor all veterans , and all servicemen and women who died defending this great country and the American flag . <p> In the future I hope that the Sun-Times will not use the American flag improperly . Robert B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The table in the photo had a striped tablecloth with a runner that had a star pattern . It was not a flag . ) Avoidable Misery <p> The story of Amy and Angela , the conjoined twins , is a tragic one , but one that also makes me very angry . <p> The Lakebergs were told early in pregnancy , following an ultrasound exam , that she was carrying conjoined twins . She should have had an immediate abortion , for the sake of the babies . <p> The pro-lifers are always saying they 're concerned about the " rights " of the unborn child , but who was concerned about the rights of Amy and Angela ? <p> Instead of doing the merciful thing and terminating the pregnancy during the first trimester , the Lakebergs allowed it to continue , and now they have the twins who are are being put through the suffering we 've all seen on TV . <p> They can not survive as they are . . . and there is virtually no chance with surgery to save one baby . <p> All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - could have been avoided . <p> Sure , they would have been sad at the time of the abortion . But they would also have known that they had spared the twins ( and themselves ) the agony they 're now experiencing . Susan Casey , Des Plaines Tough Choice <p> Kenneth and Reitha Lakeberg made one hell of a tough choice when they elected not to abort their conjoined twins , Angela and Amy . <p> Every pro-life advocate in this country should be mailing a check to this couple to help defray the mammoth medical expenses they are incurring as a result of their brave decision . Dan McGuire , Bensenville Public Circus <p> Joe Urbanik 's letter ( July 28 ) regarding " missing voices " in the abortion debate states that we only hear the voices of the extremists . <p> He said the Joe Scheidlers and the Eleanor Smeals have turned this issue into a circus sideshow . <p> The real people turning this into a public circus are the ones publicly demanding abortion on demand as one 's right . <p> The only voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of babies who will never get a chance at life .
