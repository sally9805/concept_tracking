A lot of the angry Californians who helped pass Proposition 187  --  to deny costly welfare , health care and public education to undocumented aliens  --  probably had someone like Hilda Pacheco in mind when they pulled the lever in November . Pacheco , 32 , entered the state illegally from Mexico in 1978 , never finished high school and is the single mother of two children . People like her , the argument goes , are draining $2.3 billion a year from California 's strained health care , prison and education systems while also filling some of the relatively few jobs available in the state 's recessionary economy . What 's more , they lack the skills ever to contribute as much as they will take . People like her should go home . Such anti-immigrant sentiments echo well beyond California 's borders today . Arizona , California , Florida , New Jersey and Texas are suing the federal government for a collective $14 billion  --  the states ' estimate of their outlay to support , educate , hospitalize and imprison illegal aliens . In Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rep. Barbara Jordan , urged Congress to create a national registry of legal workers , effective barring jobs from the estimated 200,000 to 300,000 undocumented immigrants each year . And the new Republican majority in Congress has gone further , threatening to cut off welfare benefits even for legal immigrants , except for refugees and those over age 75 . Before you reach your own conclusion about these initiatives , you may want to learn more about people like Hilda Pacheco . What you discover may not conform to the talk radio image of immigrants as leeches . Rather than being a drag on the economy , Pacheco  --  like most immigrants  --  is making it in America . She has never been on welfare , has attained legal status and has elevated herself from a subminimum-wage job at a hamburger stand 16 years ago to her current $50,000-a-year managerial position at a worker-training firm . " I 'm sure that illegals pay more taxes than they get credit for , " Pacheco says . With immigrants entering the U.S. at a rate of 1 million a year , foreign-born residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. population , nearly twice the percentage ( 4.7% ) in 1970 . And in California , where fully 40% of recent immigrants settle , 22% of the population was born outside the U.S. Still , foreign-born residents today make up a much smaller portion of the U.S. population than they did following the great wave of immigration at the start of the century , when foreign-born residents peaked at 15% . People who criticize today 's immigrants , however , contend that as a whole , the current newcomers are fundamentally different from the 13 million Eastern and Southern Europeans who immigrated to the U.S. in the first half of this century . They surely are different in at least one sense : Just 38% of today 's arrivals are white , compared with 88% of those who came before 1960 . Critics also argue that our high-tech economy now demands brains , not brawn , which means poorly educated and unsophisticated immigrants have little hope of following their predecessors into the middle class . If you look at the research on immigrants , however , you 'll find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Americans believe : * The vast majority of today 's immigrants  --  legal and illegal  --  are doing well , or at least striving to pave the way for their children to live better lives . Figures from the Census Bureau reveal that immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before 1980 actually boast higher average household incomes ( $40,900 ) than all native-born Americans ( $37,300 ) . * Few immigrants come here to get on welfare . In reality , working-age , nonrefugee immigrants are less likely than their native-born counterparts to be on the dole . * Immigrant children are n't gobbling up precious educational dollars , either . In fact , only 4% of the $227 billion we spend to educate our children is spent educating legal immigrant children and just 2% is spent on the estimated 648,000 kids who are here illegally . * Immigrants are not long-term drains on our economy . Yes , the estimated 3.8 million illegal immigrants cost us about $2 billion a year , chiefly because many work in low-wage jobs and often do n't pay income taxes . But over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreign-born pay $25 billion to $30 billion a year more in taxes than they consume in government services , says the Urban Institute . Like yesterday 's immigrants , the newcomers choose America because it offers a chance to prosper . Jeffrey S. Passel , the Urban Institute 's director of immigration research and policy , is optimistic about their prospects . " The very act of pulling up stakes and moving to a foreign country indicates that you have initiative and want to better yourself , " he says . The successes of today 's immigrants hold lessons for us all , whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower , in slave ships , on a turn-of-the-century steamer or on a jetliner . Jobs , not welfare Immigration 's foes are fond of pointing out that 9% of immigrant households collect cash welfare benefits , compared with only 7% of households headed by native-born Americans . But that single statistic paints a misleading picture . Welfare use is high almost exclusively among legal refugees from war-torn or Communist countries , including Cambodia ( 50% of all households ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the former Soviet Union ( 17% ) and Cuba ( 16% ) . Unlike other immigrants , these favored refugees are immediately entitled to public assistance . As a result , 16% of the refugees , in contrast to only 3% of other immigrants who came here during the 1980s , get public aid . The notion that illegal immigrants come to the U.S. to obtain welfare benefits is a myth . Illegals already are barred from all public assistance except for emergency medical care under Medicaid and the women , infants and children ( WIC ) nutrition program . Further , even a legal immigrant who goes on the dole during his first five years in the U.S. risks deportation . Though few actually get the boot , the law still acts as a deterrent because an immigrant on welfare would have difficulty getting the approvals necessary to sponsor relatives for residency in the U.S. , which is a prime goal for many immigrants . Thirty-two-year-old Iraji Khiar reflects the prevalent imminent attitude toward welfare . He fled war-torn Ethiopia in 1977 and spent the next 10 years with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry by a cousin who had come a few years earlier . But when Khiar arrived in San Diego in 1987 , he could n't locate his relative , and in order to survive , he accepted the Catholic Church 's help in signing him up for welfare  --  for all of four weeks . At that point , Khiar refused further aid , insisting that he wanted to earn his keep " with my own sweat . " He began working as a high school janitor at $7.75 an hour and attending classes toward an associate 's degree in business administration from San Diego City College . He later went into the food business with another cousin and her brother . Today the trio typically work 141 hours a week at the Maryam Sambussa Factory , which bakes savory East African pastries , and the Sphinx International Restaurant , which serves up a multiethnic stew of East African and African-American foods . The Sphinx features African and American music  --  when it 's not karaoke night . The dream is alive Academics have found that the longer immigrants are here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staples of the American dream : a home and their own business . For example , among immigrants who have lived here five to nine years , 44% own their own homes . That figure rises to 55% after at least 10 years . Some scholars believe that immigrants eventually pull ahead of natives in the income race because their work habits are n't constricted by our notions of the typical eight-hour workday . Further , a willingness to strike . out on their own has allowed many immigrants to earn more money sooner than they would have in the corporate world , given their often limited command of English . Overall , the same portion ( 7% ) of immigrants as native-born Americans are self-employed , and both groups of entrepreneurs earn , on average , about $30,000 a year . Yet for some ethnic groups , self-employment rates are significantly higher , particularly for Koreans ( 18% ) and Iranians ( 12% ) . Immigrants also are well represented in highly skilled professional and technical jobs . Two of every 10 U.S. physicians are foreign-born , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration experts argue that immigrants who arrived here after 1980 will never do as well as natives because they 're more likely than their predecessors to have come from Third World nations . Only time will tell whether recent immigrants ' median household income of $31,100 will rise . Still , a closer look at the facts reveals that these newcomers are n't as disadvantaged as they first appear . Explains University of Texas sociologist Frank D. Bean : " To say that today 's immigrants are of lower quality than their predecessors puts an unfair onus on them . They actually have more education than immigrants who came here 20 years ago . " Indeed , between 1970 and 1990 , the percentage of immigrants with college degrees climbed from 19% to 27% . Meanwhile , the portion of immigrants who dropped out of high school fell to 37% from 48% . ( By comparison , 15% of native-born Americans are high school dropouts and 27% are college graduates . ) Nearly half ( 47% ) of African immigrants hold college degrees . Even if you assume that most immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's demanding job market , it 's wrong to presume that they wo n't become taxpayers or that their children will get stuck in low-wage jobs . As Michigan State sociologist Ruben G. Rumbaut , an expert on recent immigrants , reminds us : " At the turn of the century , many people argued that the U.S. was attracting immigrants who had little education and few job skills . But the fact that you came here as a peasant did n't mean that your children would forever be part of the unwashed underclass . " Immigrant kids : Moving to the head of the class The widely held belief that most immigrant kids demand to be taught in their native languages indefinitely is also dead wrong , as is the notion that we are spending a ton of money on bilingual education . Federal spending on bilingual education , adjusted for inflation , actually fell 48% during the 1980s , despite a 50% increase in the number of public school children with limited proficiency in English . In addition , studies show that English is the language of choice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The experience of the Rev. Nancy C. Moore , senior pastor of Faith United Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles ' predominantly Hispanic Highland Park neighborhood , is instructive . Since most of the 72 children who signed up for Sunday School two years ago were Hispanic , Mrs. Moore decided to assign two teachers to each classroom , one who spoke English , another who spoke Spanish . She dropped the plan , however , when she discovered that 69 of the kids already knew English and that the three who did n't wanted to be taught in their adopted language , not their parents ' tongue . There 's also plenty of evidence that immigrants ' children are performing well academically , despite poverty , poorly educated parents and discrimination  --  problems often associated with underachievement in native-born Americans . Even children who missed years of school while detained in refugee camps abroad do amazingly well . In one study , for example , University of Michigan researchers tracked 536 Vietnamese , Laotian and Chinese-Vietnamese children who attended public schools in low-income sections of Boston , Chicago , Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s . Most were B students , more than a quarter regularly got A 's , and only 4% had grade point averages at or below C. They also did better than average on a standardized achievement test ; in math , an impressive 27% ranked in the top 10% nationwide . Why do these kids remind us of Horatio Alger rather than Bart Simpson ? Because their parents preached a mantra that has served immigrants for generations : Control your destiny through education . The kids , in turn , relish the chance to learn ; in their homelands , education is generally reserved for the wealthy . As a result , families gather around their kitchen tables on weeknights , with older children expected to assist younger siblings . The University of Michigan researchers found that , on average , immigrant grade school students studied two hours and five minutes a night , while high school kids hit the books three hours and 10 minutes . The typical American junior or senior high school student studies only an hour and a half per day . Unfortunately , other researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is often because of overassimilation into American culture . In other words , the longer they live here , the more television they watch and the less homework they do  --  results that reflect more poorly on us than them . Another myth : Success is limited to Asian kids . A study of Salvadoran , Guatemalan and Nicaraguan illegals who attended overcrowded , violence-plagued schools in the San Francisco area found that they were the academic stars of otherwise dismal institutions . Although two-thirds of the 50 Central American students surveyed worked 15 to 30 hours a week to supplement their families ' income , half made the honor roll . The most astonishing achievements , however , belong to the Hmong , people who were subsistence farmers and CIA operatives in the mountains of northern Laos during the Vietnam War . Many adult Hmong are not literate even in their native language , and a disturbing three-quarters of their households are on welfare . Yet studies of Hmong schoolkids in San Diego and St. Paul conducted during the past four years reveal that they earn better grades than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one San Diego teenager he interviewed a few years ago . The girl 's mother had died giving birth to her eighth child ; her father remarried and had six more children . In the U.S. , the family of 16 , joined by the girl 's maternal grandparents , squeezed into two apartments . The girl was responsible for keeping house , so she usually could n't start studying until midnight . Yet she scored 1216 on the SAT ( the national average is 902 ) . Muses Rumbaut : " Whenever I think of that girl , I know it 's unwise to make pronouncements about the future success of immigrants ' children simply by looking at aggregate census data on recent immigrants ' education and income . " Yet despite immigrant accomplishments , some Americans seem determined to keep whispering : No matter what , they 'll never be real Americans . They 'll keep their strange customs , congregate in ethnic enclaves , and as their numbers and economic well-being increase , they will demand political power . And if they do , well , they wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnic tribes that landed on our shores three or four generations ago and still insist on clinging to such rituals as polka dancing , playing boccie and marching in the St. Patrick 's Day parade . Are n't we better off for having let them in ? <p>
