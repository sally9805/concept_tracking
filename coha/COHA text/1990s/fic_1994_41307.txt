Once upon a time , when men and women hurtled through the air on metal wings , when they wore webbed feet and walked on the bottom of the sea , learning the speech of whales and the songs of the dolphins , when pearly-fleshed and jewelled apparitions of Texan herdsmen and houris shimmered in the dusk on Nicaraguan hillsides , when folk in Norway and Tasmania in dead of winter could dream of fresh strawberries , dates , guavas and passion fruits and find them spread next morning on their tables , there was a woman who was largely irrelevant , and therefore happy . <p> Her business was storytelling , but she was no ingenious queen in fear of the shroud brought in with the dawn , nor was she a naquibolmalek to usher a shah though the gates of sleep , nor an ashik , lover-minstrel singing songs of Mehmet the Conqueror and the sack of Byzantium , no yet a holy dervish in short skin trousers and skin skull-cap , brandishing axe or club and making its shadow terrible . She was no meddah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee-houses by the market . She was merely a narratologist , a being of secondary order , whose days were spent hunched in great libraries scrying , interpreting , decoding the fairy-tales of childhood and the vodka-posters of the grown-up world , the unending romances of golden coffee-drinkers , and the impeded couplings of doctors and nurses , dukes and poor maidens , horsewomen and musicians . Sometimes also , she flew . In her impoverished youth she had supposed that scholarship was dry , dusty and static , but now she knew better . Two or three times a year she flew to strange cities , to China , Mexico and Japan , to Transylvania , Bogota , and the South Seas , where narratologists gathered like starlings , parliaments of wise fowls , telling stories about stories . <p> At the time when my story begins the green sea was black , sleek as the skins of killer whales , and ; the sluggish waves were on fire , with dancing flames and a great curtain of stinking smoke . The empty deserts were seeded with skulls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from dune to dune . In those days men and women , including narratologists , were afraid to fly East , and their gatherings were diminished . Nevertheless our narratologist , whose name was Gillian Perholt , found herself in the air , between London and Ankara . Who can tell if she travelled because she was English and stolid and could not quite imagine being blasted out of the sky , or because , although she was indeed an imaginative being , and felt an appropriate measure of fear , she could not resist the idea of the journey above the clouds , above the minarets of Istanbul , and the lure of seeing the Golden Horn , the Bosphorus and the shores of Europe and Asia face to face ! Flying is statistically safer than any other travel , Gillian Perholt told herself and surely at this time , only slightly less safe , statistically only a little less . <p> She had a phrase for the subtle pleasures of solitary air travel . She spoke it to herself like a charm as the great silver craft detached itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albatross across the tarmac and went up , up , through grey curtains of English rain , a carpet of woolly iron-grey English cloud , a world of swirling vapour , trailing its long limbs and scarves past her tiny pothole , in the blue and gold world that was always there , above the grey , always . ' Floating redundant ' she said to herself , sipping champagne , nibbling salted almonds , whilst all round her spread the fields of heaven , white and rippling , glistening and gleaming , rosy and blue in the shadows , touched by the sun with steady brightness . ' Floating redundant ' , she murmured blissfully as the vessel banked and turned and a disembodied male voice spoke in the cabin , announcing that there was a veil of water vapour over France but that that would burn off , and then they would see the Alps , when the time came . Burn off was a powerful term , she thought , rhetorically interesting , for water does not bum and yet the sun 's heat reduces this water to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am nearer the sun than any woman of my kind , any ancestress of mine , can ever have dreamed of being , I can look in his direction and stay steadily here , floating redundant . <p> The phrase was , of course , not her own ; she was , as I have said , a being of a secondary order . The phase was John Milton 's , plucked from the air , or the circumambient language , at the height of his powers , to describe the beauty of the primordial coils of the insinuating serpent in the Paradise garden . Gillian Perholt remembered the very day these words had first coiled into shape and risen in beauty from the page , and struck at her , unsuspecting as Eve . There she was , sixteen years old , a golden-haired white virgin with vague blue eyes ( she pictured herself so ) and there on the ink-stained desk in the dust was the battered emerald-green book , ink-stained too , and second-hand , scribbled across and across by dutiful or impatient female fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hot ink and linoleum and dust if not ashes , and there he was , the creature , insolent and lovely before her : <p> not with indented wave , Prone on the ground , as since , but on his rear , Circular base of rising folds , that towered Fold above fold a surging maze , his head Crested aloft and carbuncle his eyes ; With burnished neck of verdant gold , erect Amidst his circling spires , that on the grass Floated redundant : pleasing was his shape , And lovely . <p> And for an instant Gillian Perholt had seen , brilliant and swaying , not the snake Eve had seen in the garden , nor yet the snake that had risen in the dark cave inside the skull of blind John Milton , but a snake , the snake , the same snake , in some sense , made of words and visible to the eye . So , as a child , from time to time , she had seen wolves , bears and small grey men , standing between her and the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form in an armchair . But I digress , or am about to digress . I called up the snake ( I saw him too , in my time ) to explain Dr Perholt 's summing-up of her own state . <p> In those days she had been taught to explain ' floating redundant ' as one of Milton 's magical fusings of two languages  --  ' floating ' , which was Teutonic and to do with floods , and ' redundant ' , which was involved and Latinate , and to do with overflowings . Now she brought to it her own wit , a knowledge of the modern sense of ' redundant ' , which was to say , superfluous , unwanted , unnecessary , let go . ' I 'm afraid we shall have to let you go , ' employers said , everywhere , offering freedom to reluctant Ariels , as though the employees were captive sprites , only too anxious to rush uncontrolled into the elements . Dr Perholt 's wit was only secondarily to do with employment , however . It was primarily to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in her fifties , past childbearing , whose two children were adults now , had left home and had left England , one for Saskatchewan and one for Sao Paulo , from where they communicated little , for they were occupied with children of their own . Dr Perholt 's husband also , had left home , had left Dr Perholt , had removed himself after two years of soul-searching , two years of scurrying in and out of his/their home , self-accusation , irritability , involuntary impotence , rejection of lovingly cooked food , ostentatious display of concealed messages , breathed phone-calls when Dr Perholt appeared to be sleeping , missed dinner engagements , mysterious dips in the balance at the bank , bouts of evil-smelling breath full of brandy and stale smoke , also of odd-smelling skin , with touches of alien sweat , hyacinths and stephanotis . He had gone to Majorca with Emmeline Porter and from there had sent a fax message to Gillian Perholt , saying he was a coward for doing it this way , but it was also done to save her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perholt happened to be in the study when the fax began to manifest itself , announced by a twangling bell and a whirring sound . It rose limp and white in the air and flopped exhausted over the edge of the desk  --  it was long and self-exculpatory , but there is no need for me to recount it to you , you can imagine it very well for yourself . Equally , you can imagine Emmeline Porter for yourself , she has no more to do with this story . She was twenty-six , that is all you need to know , and more or less what you supposed , probably , anyway . Gillian watched the jerky progress and flopping of the fax with admiration , not for Mr Perholt 's fluency , but for the way in which agitated black scribbling could be fed into a machine slit in Majorca and appear simultaneously in Primrose Hill . The fax had been bought for Mr Perholt , an editorial consultant , to work from home when he was let go or made redundant in the banal sense , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and story variants from narratologists in Cairo and Auckland , Osaka and Port of Spain . Now the fax was hers , since he was gone . And although she was now redundant as a woman , being neither wife , mother nor mistress , she was by no means redundant as a narratologist but on the contrary , in demand everywhere . For this was a time when women were privileged , when female narratologists had skills greatly revered , when there were pythonesses , abbesses and sibyls in the world of narratology , who revealed mysteries and kept watch at the boundaries of correctness . <p> On receiving the fax , Gillian Perholt stood in the empty study and imagined herself grieving over betrayal , the loss of love , the loss of companionship perhaps , of respect in the world , maybe , as an aging woman ejected for one more youthful . It was a sunny day in Primrose Hill , and the walls of the study were a cheerful golden colour , and she saw the room fill up with golden light and felt full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetically put it to herself , like a prisoner bursting chains and coming blinking out of a dungeon . She felt like a bird confined in a box , like a gas confined in a bottle , that found an opening , and rushed out . She felt herself expand in the space of her own life . No more waiting for meals . No more grumbling and jousting , no more exhausted anticipation of alien feelings , no more snoring , no more farts , no more trace of stubble in the washbasin . <p> She considered her reply . She wrote : <p> OK . Agree . Clothes in bales in store . Books in chests ditto . Will change locks . Have a good time . G. <p> She knew she was lucky . Her ancestresses , about whom she thought increasingly often , would probably have been dead by the age she had reached . Dead in childbed , dead of influenza , or tuberculosis , or puerperal fever , or simple exhaustion , dead , as she travelled back in time , from worn-out unavailing teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tigers , sabre-toothed tigers , invading aliens , floods , fires , religious persecution , human sacrifice , why not ? Certain female narratologists talked with pleasurable awe about wise crones but she was no crone , she was an unprecedented being , a woman with porcelain-crowned teeth , laser-corrected vision , her own store of money , her own life and field of power , who flew , who slept in luxurious sheets around the world , who gazed out at the white fields under the sun by day and the brightly turning stars by night as she floated redundant . <p> The conference in Ankara was called ' Stories of Women 's Lives ' . This was a pantechnicon title to make space for everyone , from every country , from every genre , from every time . Dr Perholt was met at the airport by an imposing bearded Turkish professor , dark and smiling , into whose arms she rushed with decorous cries of joy , for he was an old friend , they had been students together amongst mediaeval towers and slow , willow-bordered rivers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor sub-plot , a thread now tenuous , now stronger , but never broken , in the tapestry of both lives . Dr Perholt was angry at the blonde Lufthansa hostess who bowed gravely to the grey businessmen as they disembarked , Good-bye , sir and thank you , good-bye , sir and thank you , but gave Dr Perholt a condescending ' Bye-bye , dear . ' But Orhan Rifat , beyond the airport threshold , was as always alive with projects , new ideas , new poems , new discoveries . They would visit Izmir with a group of Turkish friends . Gillian would then visit Istanbul , his city . <p> The conference , like most conferences , resembled a bazaar , where stories and ideas were exchanged and changed . It took place in a cavernous theatre with no windows on the outside world but well provided with screens where transparencies flickered fitfully in the dark . The best narratologists work by telling and retelling tales . This holds the hearer from sleep and allows the teller to insert him- o herself into the tale . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary , an innocent polluter , an unwitting killer . Thus the elegant Leyla Doruk added passion and flamboyance to her version of the story of the meek Fanny Price , trembling and sickly in the deepest English wooded countryside . Orhan Rifat was to speak last : his title was ' Powers and Powerlessness : Djinns and Women in The Arabian Nights ' . Gillian Perholt spoke before him . She had chosen to analyse the ' Clerk 's Tale ' from The Canterbury Tales , which is the story of Patient Griselda . No one has ever much liked this story , although it is told by one of Chaucer 's most sympathetic pilgrims , the book-loving , unworldly Clerk of Oxford , who took it from Petrarch 's Latin , which was a rendering of Boccaccio 's Italian . Gillian Perholt did not like this story ; that was why she had chosen to tell it , amongst the stories of women 's lives . What do I think of , she had asked herself , on receiving the invitation , when I think of ' Stories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thrill and a shudder , Patient Griselda . <p> So now she told it , in Ankara , to a mixed audience of scholars and students . Most of the Turkish students were like students everywhere , in jeans and T-shirts , but conspicuous in the front row were three young women with their heads wrapped in grey scarves , and dotted amongst the young men in jeans were soldiers  --  young officers  --  in uniform . In the secular Turkish republic the scarves were a sign of religious defiance , an act of independence with which liberal-minded Turkish professors felt they should feel sympathy , though in a Muslim state much of what they themselves taught and cared about would be as objectionable , as forbidden , as the covered heads were here . The young soldiers , Gillian Perholt observed , listened intently and took assiduous notes . The three scarved women , on the other hand , stared proudly ahead , never meeting the speakers ' eyes , as though completely preoccupied with their own conspicuous self-assertion . They came to hear all the speakers . Orhan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why she dressed as she did . ' My father and my fiancee say it is fight , ' she had said . ' And I agree . ' <p> The story of Patient Griselda , as told by Gillian Perholt , is this : <p> There was once a young marquis , in Lombardy , whose name was Walter . He enjoyed his life , and his sports  --  hunting and hawking  --  as young men do , and had no desire to marry , perhaps because marriage appeared to him to be a form of confinement , or possibly because marriage is the end of youth , and its freedom from care , if youth is free from care . However his people came and urged him to take a wife , perhaps , as they told him , because he should think of begetting an heir , perhaps because they felt marriage would steady him . He professed himself moved by their arguments and invited them to his wedding , on a certain day he fixed on  --  with the condition that they swore to accept this bide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Walter 's peculiarities that he liked to make people swear in advance to accept unconditionally and without repining whatever he himself might choose to do . <p> So the people agreed and made ready for the wedding on the chosen day . They made a feast and prepared rich clothes , jewels and bedlinen for the unknown bride . And on the chosen day the priest was waiting , and the bridal procession mounted , and still no one knew who the bride was to be . <p> Now Griseldis of Grisilde or Grisildis or Grissel or Griselda was the daughter of a poor peasant . She was both beautiful and virtuous . On the day fixed for the wedding she set out to fetch water from the well ; she had all the domestic virtues and meant to finish her housework before standing in the lane with the other peasants to cheer as the bridal procession wound past . Weddings make spectators  --  participating spectators  --  of us all . Griselda wanted to be part of the wedding , and to look at the bride , as we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brides and princesses , those inside the story , imagined from the outside . Who knows but Griselda was looking forward to imagining the feelings of this unknown woman as she rode past . <p> Only the young lord rode up , and did not ride past , but stopped , and made her put down her pitcher , and wait . And he spoke to her father , and said that it was his intention to make Griselda his wife , if her father would give his consent to her will . So the young lord spoke to the young woman and said he wanted to make her his bride , and that his only requirement was that she should promise to obey him in everything , to do whatever he desired , without hesitating or repining , at every moment of the day or night . And Griselda , ' quakynge for drede ' as Chaucer tells us , swore that never willingly , in act or thought , would she disobey him , on pain of death  --  though she would fear to die , she told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her clothes should be taken off and that she should be clothed in the rich new garments he had prepared , with her hair dressed and her head crowned with a jewelled coronet . And so she went away to be married , and to live in the castle , and Chaucer tells us , he takes care to tell us , that she showed great qualities of judgment , reconciliation of disputes , bounty and courtesy in her new position , and was much loved by the people . <p> But the story goes inexorably on , past the wedding , into the ominous future foreshadowed by the pledge exacted and vouchsafed . And consider this , said Gillian Perholt at this point in the story : in almost all stories of promises and prohibitions , the promises and prohibitions carry with them the inevitability of failure , of their own breaking . Orhan Rifat smiled into his beard , and the soldiers wrote rapidly , presumably about promises and prohibitions , and the grey-scarved women stared fixedly ahead . <p> After a time , Chaucer says , Griselda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have borne a son ; but everyone rejoiced , for once it is seen that a woman is not barren , a son may well come next . And at this point it came into Walter 's head that he must test his wife . It is interesting said Gillian , that here the Clerk of Oxford dissociates himself as narrator from his protagonist , and says he can not see why this testing seemed to be necessary . But he goes on to tell how Walter informed his wife gravely that the people grumbled at having a peasant 's daughter set over them , and did not want such a Epson ' child to be set above them . He therefore proposed , he said , to put her daughter to death . And Griselda answered that she and her child were his to do with as he thought best . So Walter sent a rough sergeant to take the child , from the breast . And Griselda kissed it good-bye , asking only that the baby should be buried where wild creatures could not tear it . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , and the husband , still intent on testing , had this child too taken from the breast and carried away to be killed . And Griselda kept steadily to her pact , assuring him that she was not grieved or hurt ; that her two children had bought her only sickness at first ' and after , woe and pain ' . <p> And then there was a lull in the narrative , said Gillian , a lull long enough for the young children who were secretly being brought up in Bologna to reach puberty , adolescence , a marriageable age . A lull as long as the space between acts III and IV of A Winter 's Tale during which Hermione the Queen is hidden away and thought to be dead , and her daughter , Perdita , abandoned and exposed , is brought up by shepherds , wooed by a Prince , and forced to flee to Sicily where she is happily reunited with her repentant father and her lost mother who appears on a pedestal as a statue and is miraculously given her life and happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gillian , the lovely daughter is the renewal of the mother , as the restoration of Persephone was the renewal of the fields in Spring , laid waste by the rage of Demeter , the mother-goddess . Here Gillian 's voice faltered . She looked out at the audience and told them how Paulina , Hermione 's friend and servant , had taken on the powers of witch , artist , storyteller , and had restored the lost queen to life . Personally , said Gillian , I have never been able to stomach  --  to bear  --  that plotted denouement , which is the opposite of the restoration of Persephone in Spring . For human beings do not die and spring up again like the grass and the corn , they live one life and get older . And from Hermione  --  and as you may know already , from Patient Griselda  --  most of that life has been taken by plotting , has been made into a grey void of forced inactivity . <p> What did Griselda do whilst her son , and more particularly her daughter were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life runs from wedding to childbirth to nothing in a twinkling of an eye . Chaucer gives no hint of subsequent children , though he insists that Griselda remained true in love and patience and submission . But her husband had to excess Paulina 's desire to narrate , to orchestrate , to direct . He busied himself , he gained a dispensation from the pope to put away his wife Griselda , and to marry a young bride . The people muttered about the murdered children . But Walter , if we are to believe the story , went to his patient wife and told her that he intended to replace her with a younger and more acceptable bride , and that she must return to her father , leaving behind the rich clothes and jewels and other things which had been his gift . And still Griselda was patient , though Chaucer here gives her words of power in her patience which keep the reader 's sympathy , and fend off the reader 's impatience which might serve that sympathy . <p> Naked , Griselda tells her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . But since he has taken all he old clothes she asks him for a smock to cover he nakedness , since ' the womb in which your children lay , should not , as I walk , be seen bare before the people . Let me not , ' says Griselda , ' go by the way like a worm . In exchange for my maidenhead which I brought with me and can not take away , give me a smock . ' And Walter graciously allows her the shift she stands in , to cover her nakedness . <p> But Walter thought of other twists to the intrigue , since every twist made his plotted denouement more splendid and satisfactory . No sooner , it seemed , was Griselda back at home , than her husband was there , asking her to return to the castle and prepare the rooms and the feast for his new young bride . No one could do it better , he told her . You might think that the pact was over on her return to her father 's house , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patiently she cooked , cleaned , prepared , made up the marriage bed . <p> And the bridal procession arrived at the castle , with the beautiful girl in the midst , and Griselda worked away in the hall in her poor clothes , and the feast was set , and the lords and ladies sat down to eat . Now indeed , apparently , Griselda was a belated spectator at the wedding . Walter called Griselda to him and asked her what she thought of his wife and her beauty . And Griselda did not curse her , or indeed him , but answered always patiently , that she had never seen a fairer woman , and that she both beseeched and warned him ' never to prick this tender maiden with tormenting ' as he had done her , for the young bride was softly brought up and would not endure it . <p> And now Walter had his denouement , the end of his story , and revealed to Griselda that his bride was not his bride , but her daughter , and the squire her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be happy , for he had done all this neither in malice nor in cruelty , but to test her good faith , which he had not found wanting . So now they could be reconciled . <p> And what did Griselda do ? asked Gillian Perholt And what did she say , and what did she do ? repeated Dr Perholt . Her audience was interested . It was not a story most of them knew beyond the title and its idea , Patient Griselda . Would the worm turn ? one or two asked themselves , moved by Griselda 's image of her own naked flesh . They looked up to Dr Perholt for an answer , and she was silent , as if frozen . She stood on the stage , her mouth open to speak , and her hand out , in a rhetorical gesture , with the lights glittering on her eyeballs . She was an ample woman , a stout woman , with a soft clear skin , clothed in the kind of draped linen dress and jacket that is best for stout women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass beads . <p> And Gillian Perholt stared out of glassy eyes and heard her voice fail . She was far away and long ago  --  she was a pillar of salt , her voice echoed inside a glass box , a sad piping like a lost grasshopper in winter . She could move neither fingers nor lips , and in the body of the hall , behind the grey-scarved women , she saw a cavernous form , a huge , female form , with a veiled head bowed above emptiness and long slack-sinewed arms , hanging loosely around emptiness , and a draped , cowled garment ruffling over the windy vacuum of nothing , a thing banal in its conventional awfulness , and for that very reason appalling because it was there , to be seen , her eyes could distinguish each fold , could measure the red rims of those swollen eyes , could see the cracks in the stretched lips of that toothless , mirthless mouth , could see that it was many colours , and all of them grey , grey . The creature was flat breasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windy hole that was its belly and womb . <p> This is what I am afraid of , thought Gillian Perholt , whose intelligence continued to work away , to think of ways to ascertain whether or not the thing was a product of hallucination or somehow out there on an unexpected wavelength . <p> And just as Orhan rose to come to her help , seeing her stare like Macbeth at the feast , she began to speak again , as though nothing had happened , and the audience sighed and sat back , ill at ease but courteous . <p> And what did Griselda do ? asked Gillian Perholt And what did Griselda say and what did she do ? repeated Dr Perholt . First , all mazed , uncomprehending , she swooned . When she revived , she thanked her husband for having saved her children , and told her children that her father had cared for them tenderly  --  and she embraced both son and daughter , tightly , tightly , and still gripping them fell again into terrible unconsciousness , gripping so tightly , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children from her grasp . Chaucer does not say , the Clerk of Oxford does not say , that she was strangling them , but there is fear in his words , and in the power of her grip , all her stoppered and stunted energy forcing all three into unconsciousness , unknowing , absence from the finale so splendidly brought about by their lord and master . <p> But of course , she was revived , and again stripped of her old clothes , and dressed in cloth of gold and crowned with jewels and restored to her place at the feast . To begin again . <p> And I wish to say a few words , said Gillian Perholt , about the discomfort of this terrible tale . You might suppose it was one of that group of tales in which the father or king or lord tries to marry his daughter , after his wife 's death , as the original Leontes tried to marry Perdita in the tale that precedes the Winter Tale , the tale of a man seeking the return of spring and youth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass and the flowers of the field . This pattern is painful but natural , this human error which tales hasten to punish and correct . But the peculiar horror of Patient Griselda does not lie in the psychological terror of incest or even of age . It lies in the narration of the story and Walter 's relation to it . The story is terrible because Walter has assumed too many positions in the narration ; he is hero , villain , destiny , God and narrator  --  there is no play in this tale , though the Clerk and Chaucer behind him try to vary its tone with reports of the people 's contradictory feelings , and with the wry final comment on the happy marriage of Griselda 's son , who <p> fortunat was eek in mariage , Al putte he nat his wyf in greet assay . This world is nat so strong , it is no nay , As it hath been in olde tymes yoore . <p> And the commentator goes on to remark that the moral is not that wives should follow Griselda in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if desired . The moral is that of Job , says the Clerk , according to Petrarch , that human beings must patiently bear what comes to them . And yet our own response is surely outrage  --  at what was done to Griselda  --  at what was taken from her , the best part of her life , what could not be restored  --  at the energy stopped off . For the stories of women 's lives in fiction are the stories of stopped energies  --  the stories of Fanny Price , Lucy Snowe , even Gwendolen Harleth , are the stories of Griselda , and all come to that moment of strangling , willed oblivion . <p> Gillian Perholt looked up . The creature , the ghoul , was gone . There was applause . She stepped down . Orhan , who was forthright and kind , asked if she felt unwell and she said that she had had a dizzy turn . She thought it was nothing to worry about . A momentary mild seizure . She would have liked to tell him about the apparition too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her mouth , and the thing would not be spoken . What can not be spoken continues its vigorous life in the veins , in the brain-cells , in the nerves . As a child she had known that if she could describe the grey men on the stairs , or the hag in the lavatory , they would vanish . But she could not . She imagined them lusciously and in terror and occasionally saw them , which was different . <p> Orhan 's paper was the last in the conference . He was a born performer , and always had been , at least in Gillian 's experience . She remembered a student production of Hamlet in which they had both taken part . Orhan had been Hamlet 's father 's ghost and had curdled everyone 's blood with his deep-voiced rhetoric . His beard was now , as it had not been then , ' a sable silvered ' , and had now , as it had had then , an Elizabethan cut  --  though his face had sharpened from its youthful thoughtfulness and he now bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mehmet the Conqueror . She herself had been Gertrude , although she had wanted to be Ophelia , she had wanted to be beautiful and go passionately mad . She had been the Queen who could not see the spirit stalking her bedchamber ; this came into her mind , with a renewed , now purely imaginary vision of the Hermione-Griselda ghoul , as she saw Orhan , tall , imposing , smiling in his beard , begin to speak of Scheherazade and the djinniyah . <p> ' It has to be admitted , ' said Orhan , ' that misogyny is a driving force of pre-modern story collections  --  perhaps especially of the frame stories  --  from Katha Sarit Sagara , The Ocean of Story , to the Thousand and One Nights , Alf Layla wa-Layla . Why this should be so has not , as far as I know , been fully explained , though there are reasons that could be put forward from social structures to depth psychology  --  the sad fact remains that women in these stories for the most part are portrayed as deceitful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simply dangerous , operating powerfully ( apart from sorceresses and female ghouls and ogres ) through the structures of powerlessness . What is peculiarly interesting about the Thousand and One Nights in terms of the subject of our conference , is the frame story , which begins with two kings driven to murderous despair by the treachery of women , yet has a powerful heroine-narrator , Scheherazade , who must daily save her own life from a blanket vicarious vengeance on all women by telling tales in the night , tales in the bed , in the bedchamber , to her innocent little sister  --  Scheherazade whose art is an endless beginning and delaying and ending and beginning and delaying and ending  --  a woman of infinite resource and sagacity , ' said Orhan smiling , ' who is nevertheless using cunning and manipulation from a position of total powerlessness with the sword of her fate more or less in he bedchamber hanging like the sword of Damocles by a metaphorical thread , the thread of her narrative , with her shroud daily prepared for her the next morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon himself to be husband and destiny , leaving only the storytelling element , the plotting , to his wife , which is enough . Enough to save her , enough to provide space for the engendering and birth of her children , whom she hides from her husband as Walter hid his from Griselda , enough to spin out her life until it becomes love and happy-ever-after , so to speak , as Griselda 's does . For these tales are not psychological novels , are not concerned with states of mind or development of character , but bluntly with Fate , with Destiny , with what is prepared for human beings . And it has been excellently said by Pasolini the filmmaker that the tales in the Thousand and One Nights all end with the disappearance of destiny which ' sinks back into the somnolence of daily life . ' But Scheherazade 's own life could not sink back into somnolence until all the tales wee told . So the dailiness of daily life is her end as it is Cinderella 's and Snow-White 's but not Mme Bovary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanish into the afterlife of stories . But I am anticipating my argument , which , like my friend and colleague Dr Perholt 's argument , is about character and destiny and sex in the folk-tale , where character is not destiny as Novalis said it was , but something else is . <p> And first I shall speak of the lives of women in the frame story , and then I shall briefly discuss the story of Camaralzaman and Princess Budoor , which is only half-told in the manuscripts of the Nights ... <p> Gillian Perholt sat behind the grey-scarved women and watched Orhan 's dark hooked face as he told of the two kings and brothers Shahriyar and Shahzaman , and of how Shahzaman , setting out on a journey to his brother , went back home to bid his wife farewell , found her in the arms of a kitchen boy , slew them both immediately , and set out on his journey consumed by despair and disgust . These emotions were only relieved when he saw from his brother 's palace window the arrival in a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of these ten were white and ten black , and the black cast off their robes revealing themselves to be young males , who busily tupped the white females , whilst the queen 's black lover Mas'ud came out of a tree and did the same for her . This amused and believed Shahzaman , who saw that his own fate was the universal fate , and was able to demonstrate to his brother , at first incredulous and then desperate with shame and wrath , that this was so . So the two kings , in disgust and despondency , left the court and their life at the same moment and set out on a pilgrimage in search of someone more unfortunate than themselves , poor cuckolds as they were . <p> Note , said Orhan , that at this time no one had attempted the lives of the queen and her black love and the twenty lascivious slaves . <p> And what the two kings met was a djinn , who burst out of the sea like a swaying black pillar that touched the clouds , carrying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the two kings ( like Mas'ud before them ) took refuge in a tree . And the djinn laid himself down to sleep , as luck , or chance , of fate would have it , under that very tree , and opened the chest to release a beautiful woman  --  one he had carried away on her wedding night  --  on whose lap he laid his head and immediately began to snore . Whereupon the woman indicated to the two kings that she knew where they were , and would scream and reveal their presence to the djinn unless they immediately came down and satisfied her burning sexual need . The two kings found this difficult , in the circumstances , but were persuaded by threats of immediate betrayal and death to do their best . And when they had both made love to the djinn 's stolen wife , as she lay with opened legs on the desert sand under the tree , she took from both of them their rings , which she put away in a small purse on her person , which already contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the two kings with some complacency that they were all the rings of men with whom she had been able to deceive the djinn , despite being locked in a glass case with four steel locks , kept in the depths of the raging roaring sea . And the djinn , she explained , had tried in vain to keep her pure and chaste , not realising that nothing can prevent or alter what is predestined , and that when a woman desires something , nothing can stop her . <p> And the two kings concluded , after they were well escaped , that the djinn was more unfortunate than they were , so they returned to the palace , put Shahriyar 's wife and the twenty slaves to the sword , replaced the female slaves in the harem , and instituted the search for virgin brides who should all be put to death after one night ' to save King Shahriyar from the wickedness and cunning of women ' . And this led to Scheherazade 's resourceful plan to save countless other gifts by substituting narrative attractions for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard , which took her a thousand and one nights . And in these frame stories , said Orhan , destiny for men is to lose dignity because of female rapacity and duplicity , and destiny for women is to be put to the sword on that account . <p> What interests me about the story of Prince Camaralzaman , said Orhan , is the activity of the djinn in bringing about a satisfactory adjustment to the normal human destiny in the recalcitrant prince . Camaralzaman was the beloved only son of Sultan Shahriman of Khalidan . He was the child of his father 's old age , born of a virgin concubine with ample proportions , and he was very beautiful , like the moon , like new anemones in spring , like the children of angels . He was amiable but full of himself , and when his father urged him to marry to perpetuate his line , he cited the books of the wise , and their accounts of the wickedness and perfidy of women , as a reason for refraining , ' I would rather die than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Camaralzaman , ' Indeed , ' he said grandly , ' I would not hesitate to kill myself if you wished to force me into marriage . ' So his father left the topic for a year , during which Camaralzaman grew even more beautiful , and then asked again , and was told that the boy had done even more reading , which had simply convinced him that women were immoral , foolish and disgusting , and that death was preferable to dealing with them . And after another year , on the advice of his vizir , the king approached the prince formally in front of his court and was answered with insolence . So , on the advice of the vizir , the king confined his son to a ruined Roman tower , where he left him to fend for himself until he became more amenable . <p> Now , in the water-tank of the tower lived a djinniyah , a female djinn , who was a Believer , a servant of Suleyman , and full of energy . Djinns , as you may of may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligences under Allah  --  the angels , formed of light , the djinns , formed of subtle fire , and man , created from the dust of the earth . There are three orders of djinns  --  flyers , walkers and divers ; they are shape-shifters , and like human beings , divided into servants of God and servants of Iblis , the demon lord . The Koran often exhorts the djinns and men equally to repentance and belief , and there do exist legal structures governing the marriage and sexual relations of humans and djinns . They are creatures of this world , sometimes visible , sometimes invisible ; they haunt bathrooms and lavatories , and they fly through the heavens . They have their own complex social system and hierarchies , into which I will not divagate . The djinniyah in question , Maimunah , was a flyer , and flew past the window of Camaralzaman 's tower , where she saw the young man , beautiful as ever in his sleep , flew in and spent some time admiring him . Out again in the night sky she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who told her excitedly of a beautiful Chinese Princess , the lady Budoor , confined to he quarters by her old women , for fear she should stab herself , as she had sworn to do when threatened with a husband , asking , ' How shall my body , which can hardly bear the touch of silks , tolerate the rough approaches of a man ? ' And the two djinns began to dispute , circling on leathery wings in the middle air , as to which human creature , the male or the female , was the most beautiful . And the djinniyah commanded Dahnash to fetch the sleeping princess from China and lay her beside Prince Camaralzaman for comparison , which was performed , within an hour . The two genies , male and female , disputed hotly  --  and in formal verse  --  without coming to any conclusions as to the prize for beauty . So they summoned up a third being  --  a huge earth-spirit , with six horns , three forked tails , a hump , a limp , one immense and one pygmy arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this being performed a triumphal dance about the bed , and announced that the only way to test the relative power of these perfect beauties was to wake each in turn and see which showed the greater passion for the other , and the one who aroused the greater lust would be the winner . So this was done ; the prince was woken , swooning with desire and respect , and put to sleep with his desire unconsummated , and the princess was then woken , whose consuming need aroused power and reciprocating desire in the sleeping prince , and ' that happened which did happen ' . And before I go on to recount and analyse the separation and madness of Camaralzaman and Budoo , the prince 's long search , disguised as a geomancer , for his lost love , their marriage , their subsequent separation , owing to the theft of a talisman from the princess 's drawers by a hawk , Princess Budoor 's resourceful disguise as her husband , he wooing of a princess , her wooing of her own husband to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this I would like to comment on the presence of the djinns at this defloration of Budoor by Camaralzaman , their unseen delight in the human bodies , the strangeness of the apprehension of the secret consummation of first love as in fact the narrative contrivance of a group of bizarre and deeply involved onlookers , somewhere between gentlemen betting at a horse-face , entremetteurs , metteurs-en-scene or storytellers and gentlemen and ladies of the bedchamber . This moment of narrative , ' said Orhan , ' has always puzzled and pleased me because it is told from the point of view of these three magical beings , the prime instigator female , the subordinate ones male . What is the most private moment of choice in a human life  --  the loss of virginity , the mutual loss of virginity indeed , in total mutual satisfaction and bliss  --  takes place as a function of the desire and curiosity and competitive urgings of fire-creatures from sky and earth and cistern . Camaralzaman and Budoor  --  here also like Count Walter  --  have tried to preserve their freedom and their will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oppressive  --  and there in deepest dream they give way to their destiny which is conducted somewhere between comedy and sentimentality by this bizarre unseen trio  --  of whom the most redundant , from the point of view of the narrative , is also the largest , the most obtrusive , the most memorable , the horned , fork-tailed appallingly disproportioned solid earth-troll who capes in glee over the perfectly proportioned shapes of the two sleeping beauties . It is as though our dreams were watching us and directing our lives with external vigour whilst we simply enact their pleasures passively , in a swoon . Except that the djinns are more solid than dreams and have all sorts of the interests and preoccupations besides the young prince and princess ... ' <p> The soldiers were writing busily ; the scarved women stared ahead motionlessly , holding their heads high and proud . Gillian Perholt listened with pleasure to Orhan Rifat , who had gone on to talk more technically about the narrative imagination and its construction of reality in tales within tales within tales . She was tied ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full of fumes from brown coal , calling up her childhood days in a Yorkshire industrial city , where sulphur took her breath from he and kept her in bed with asthma , day after long day , reading fairy-tales and seeing the stories pass before her eyes . And they had gone to see The Thief of Baghdad when she was little ; they had snuffed the sulphur as the enchanted horse swooped across the screen and the genie swelled from a speck to a cloud filling the whole sea-shore . There had been an air-raid whilst they were in the cinema : the screen had flickered and jumped , and electric flashes had disturbed the magician 's dark glare ; small distant explosions had accompanied the princess 's wanderings in the garden ; they had all had to file out and hide in the cellars , she remembered , and she had wheezed , and imagined wings and fire in the evening air . What did I think my life was to be , then ? Gillian Perholt asked herself , no longer listening to Orhan Rifat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons in the fictions of fictive persons in the fiction of real persons , in the reader and the writer . I had this idea of a woman I was going to be , and I think it was before I knew what sex was ( she had been thinking with her body about the swooning delight of Camaralzaman and Princess Budoo ) but I imagined I would be married , a married woman , I would have a veil and a wedding and a house and someone someone  --  devoted , like the thief of Baghdad , and a dog . I wanted  --  but not by any stretch of the imagination to be a narratologist in Ankara , which is so much more interesting and surprising , she told herself , trying to listen to what Orhan Rifat was saying about thresholds and veils . <p> The next day she had half a day to herself and went to the Museum of Anatolian Civilisations , which all her Turkish friends assured her she should not miss , and met an Ancient Mariner The British Council car left her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , cut into the hillside , made unobtrusively of wood and glass , a quiet , reflective , thoughtful , elegant place , in which she had looked forward to being alone for an hour or two , and savouring her delightful redundancy . The ancient person in question emerged soundlessly from behind a pillar or statue and took her by the elbow . American ? he said , and she replied indignantly , No , English , thus embarking willy-nilly on a conversation . I am the official guide , this person claimed . I fought with the English soldiers in Korea , good soldiers , the Turks and the English are both good soldiers . He was a heavy , squat , hairless man , with rolling folds between his cranium and his shoulders , and a polished gleam to his broad naked head , like marble . He wore a sheepskin jacket , a military medal , and a homemade-looking badge that said GUIDE . His forehead was low over his eye-sockets  --  he had neither brows nor lashes and his wide mouth opened on a whitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you everything , he said to Gillian Perholt , gripping her elbow , I know things you will never find out for yourself . She said neither yes nor no , but went down into the hall of the museum , with the muscular body of the ex-soldier shambling after her . Look , he said , as she stared into a reconstructed earth-dwelling , look how they lived in those days , the first people , they dug holes like the animals , but they made them comfortable for themselves . Look here at the goddess . One day , think , they found themselves turning the bits of clay in their hands , and they saw a head and a body , see , in the clay , they saw a leg and an arm , they pushed a bit and pinched bit here and there , and there She was , look at her , the little fat woman . They loved fat , it meant strength and good prospects of children and living through the winter , to those naked people , they were probably thin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they made her fat , fat , fat was life to them . And who knows why they made the first little woman , a doll , an image , a little offering to the goddess , to propitiate her  --  what came first , the doll or the goddess we can not know but we think they worshipped her , the fat woman , we think they thought everything came out of her hole , as they came out of their underground houses , as the plants and trees come out in the spring after the dark . Look at her here , here she is very old , eight thousand years , nine thousand years before your Christian time-counting , here she is only the essential , a head and arms , and legs and lovely fat belly , breasts to feed , no need even for hands or feet , here , see no face . Look at her , made out of the dust of the earth by human fingers so old , so old you ca n't really imagine . <p> And Gillian Perholt looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulled in her stomach muscles , and felt the fear of death in the muscles of her heart , thinking of these centuries-old fingers fashioning flesh of clay . <p> And later , he said , guiding her from figure to figure , she became powerful , she became the goddess in the lion throne , see here she sits , she is the ruler of the world now , she sits in her throne with her arms on the lion-heads , and see there , the head of the child coming out between her legs , see how well those old people knew how to show the little skull of the baby as it turns to be born . <p> There were rows of the little baked figurines ; all generically related , all different also . The woman in rolls of fat on the squat throne , crowned with a circlet of clay , and the arms of the throne were standing lions and her buttocks protruded behind her , and her breasts fell heavy and splayed , and her emptying belly sagged realistically between her huge fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the flesh . Her hands were lion-heads , her head bald as the ancient soldier 's and square down the back of the fat neck as his was . <p> We do n't like our girls fat now , said the ancient one , regretfully . We like them to look like young boys , the boys out of the Greek gymnasium round the corner . Look at her , though , you can see how powerful she was , how they touched her power , scratching the shape into her breasts there , full of goodness they thought and hoped . <p> Gillian Perholt did not look at the old soldier whose voice was full of passion ; she had not exactly consented to his accompanying narrative , and the upper layer of her consciousness was full of embarrassed calculations about how much Turkish cash she was carrying and how that would convert into pounds sterling , and how much such a guide might require at the end of this tale , if she could not shed him . So they trod on , one behind the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he never ceasing to speak into her ear , into the back of her studious head , as he darted from glass case to glass case , maneuvering his bulk lightly and silently , as though shod with felt . And in the cases the clay women were replaced by metal stags and sun-discs , and the tales behind her were tales of kings and armies , of sacrifice and slaughter , of bride-sacrifice and sun-offerings , and she was helplessly complicit , for here was the best , the most assured raconteur she could hope to meet . She knew nothing of the Hittites or the Mesopotamians or the Babylonians or the Sumerians , and not much of the Egyptians and the Romans in this context , but the soldier did , and made a whole wedding from a two-spouted wine-jar in the form of ducks , or from a necklace of silver and turquoise , and a centuries-old pot of kohl he made a nervous bride , looking in a bronze mirror- his whisper called up her black hair , her huge eyes , her hand steadying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen . He talked too , between centuries and between cases , of the efficiency of the British and Turkish soldiers fighting side by side on the Korean hillsides , and Gillian remembered her husband saying that the Turks ' punishments for pilfering and desertion had been so dreadful that they were bothered by neither . And she thought of Orhan , saying , ' People who think of Turks think of killing and lasciviousness , which is sad , for we are complicated and have many natures . Including a certain ferocity . And a certain pleasure in good living . ' <p> The lions of the desert were death to the peoples of Anatolia , said the old guide , as they neared the end of their journey , which had begun with the earth-dwellers and moved through the civilisations that built the sun-baked ziggufats , towards the lion-gates of Nineveh and Assyia . That old goddess , she sat on the lion-throne , the lions were a part of her power , she was the earth and the lions . And later the kings and the warriors tamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skins and made statues of them as guardians against the wild . Here are the Persian lions , the word is Aslan , they are strength and death , you can walk through that carved lion-gate into the world of the dead , as Gilgamesh did in search of Enkidu his friend who was dead . Do you know the story of Gilgamesh , the old man asked the woman , as they went through the lion-gates together , she always in font and with averted eyes . The museum had arranged various real carved walls and gates into imaginary passages and courtyards , like a minor maze in a cool light . They were now , in the late afternoon , the only two people in the museum , and the old soldier 's voice was hushed , out of awe perhaps , of the works of the dead , out of respect perhaps , for the silence of the place , where the glass cases gleamed in the shadows . <p> See here , he said , with momentary excitement , see here is the story of Gilgamesh carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See here is the hero clothed in skins and here is his friend the wild man with his club  --  here is their meeting , here they wrestle and make friends on the threshold of the king 's palace . Do you know Enkidu ? He was huge and hairy , he lived with the beasts in the woods and fields , he helped them escape the trappers and hunters . But the trappers asked Gilgamesh the king to send a woman , a whore , who tempted Enkidu to leave the world of the gazelles and the herds and come to the king , who fought him and loved him . And they were inseparable , and together they killed the giant Humbaba  --  tricked and killed him in the forest . They trick and kill him , they are young and strong , there is nothing they can not do . But then Gilgamesh 's youth and strength attract the attention of the Goddess Ishtar  --  she was the goddess of Love , and also of War  --  she is the same goddess you know , ma'am , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Diana she was the same goddess  --  terrible and beautiful  --  whose temples were surrounded by whores  --  holy whores  --  whose desires could not be denied . And Ishtar wanted to marry Gilgamesh but he repelled her  --  he thought she would trick him and destroy him , and he made the mistake of telling her so , telling her he did n't want her , he wanted to remain free  --  for she had destroyed Tammuz , he said , whom the women wailed for , and she had turned shepherds into wolves and rejected lovers into blind moles , and she had destroyed the lions in pits and the horses in battle , although she loved their fierceness . And this made Ishtar angry  --  and she sent a great bull from heaven to destroy the kingdom , but the heroes killed the bull  --  see here in the stone they drive their sword behind his horns  --  and Enkidu ripped off the bull 's thigh and threw it in the face of Ishtar . And she called the temple whores to weep for the bull and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick on his bed and dreams of death . For young men , you know , they do not know death , or they think of it as a lion or a bull to be wrestled and conquered . But sick men know death , and Enkidu dreamed of His coming  --  a birdman with a ghoul-face and claws and feathers  --  for the loathsome picture of death , you see , is from the vulture  --  and Enkidu dreamed that this Death was smothering him and turning him into the bird-man and that he was going to the Palace of the gods of the underworld  --  and there , Enkidu saw in this dream , there was no light at all and no joy and the people are dust and fed on clay . There is a goddess down there too  --  here she is  --  Ereshkigal the Queen of the underworld . And both Gilgamesh and Enkdiu wept at this dream  --  it terrified them  --  it took away all their strength  --  and then Enkidu died , in terrible pain , and Gilgamesh could not be comforted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never come back . He was young and strong , he would not accept that there was death walking in the world . Young men are like that , you know , it 's a truth  --  they think they can defy what 's coming because their blood is hot and their bodies are strong . <p> And Gilgamesh remembered his ancestor , Uta-Napishtim who was the only man who had survived when the earth was flooded ; they said he lived in the underworld and had the secret of living forever . So Gilgamesh travelled on and travelled on , and came to a mountain called Mashu , and at the mountain 's gate were the man-scorpions , demons you know , like dragons . We can pretend that this gate is the gate of the underworld  --  the Sumerian people , the Babylonian people , they made great solid gates to their buildings and built guardians into the gates . See here are lions , and here , at this gate , are genies  --  you say genies ?  --  yes , genies ,  --  there were good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utukku and some were good and some were evil  --  the good ones were like these guardians here who are bulls with wings and wise faces of men  --  they are called shedu or lamassu  --  they stand here as guardians , but they could take other shapes , they walked invisibly behind men in the streets ; every one had his genie , some people say , and they protected them  --  there is an old saying , ' he who has no genie when he walks in the streets wears a headache like a garment ' . That 's interesting , do n't you think ? <p> Gillian Perholt nodded . She had a headache herself  --  she had had a kind of penumbral headache , accompanied by occasional stabs from invisible stilettos or ice-splinters since she had seen the Griselda-ghoul , and everything shimmered a little , with a grey shimmer , in the space between the gate and the narratives carved in relief on the stone tablets . The old soldier had become more and more animated , and now began to act out Gilgamesh 's arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bear , approaching , stepping back , staring up , skipping briskly from the courtyard to the space between the gateposts , raising his fingers to his bald skull for horns and answering himself in the person of the scorpion-men . ( These are good genies , ma'am , said the old soldier parenthetically . The scorpion-men might have been dangerous ones , edimmu or worse , arallu , who came out of the underworld and caused pestilence , they sprang from the goddess 's bile , you must imagine terrifying scorpion-men in the place of these bulls with wings . ) They say , why have you come ? And Gilgamesh says , For Enkidu my friend . And to see my father Uta-Napishtim among the gods . And they say , No man born of woman has gone into the mountain ; it is very deep ; there is no light and the heart is oppressed with darkness . Oppressed with darkness . He skipped out again and strode resolutely in , as Gilgamesh . She thought , he is a descendant of the ashiks of whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wore a skin hat and carried a club or a sword as a professional prop . They made shadows with their clubs on cafe walls and in market squares . The old soldier 's shadow mopped and mowed amongst the carved utukku : he was Gilgamesh annihilated in the dark ; he came out into the light and became Siduri , the woman of the vine , in the garden at the edge of the sea with golden bowl and golden vats of wind ; he became Urshanabi the ferryman of the Ocean , disturbed at the presence of one who wore skins and ate flesh , in the other world . He was , Gillian Perholt thought suddenly , related to Karagoz and Hacivat , the comic heroes and animators of the Turkish shadow-puppets , who fought both demons from the underworld and fat capitalists . Orhan Rifat was a skilled puppeteer : he had a leather case full of the little figures whom he could bring to life against a sheet hung on a frame , against a white wall . <p> ' And Uta-Napishtim , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone lion , and fixing Gillian Perholt with his eye , ' Uta-Napishtim told Gilgamesh that there was a plant , a flower , that grew under the water . It was a flower with a sharp thorn that would wound his hands- but if he could win it he would have his lost youth again . So Gilgamesh tied heavy stones to his feet and sank into the deep water and walked in the seabed , and came to the plant which did prick him , but he grasped it and brought it up again into the light . And Gilgamesh set out again with Urshanabi the ferryman to take the flower back to the old men of his city , Uruk , to bring back their lost youths . And when they had travelled on and on , said the Ancient Mariner , weaving his way between the ancient monuments in his shuffling dance , he came to a deep well of cool water , and he bathed in it , and refreshed himself . But deep in the pool there was a snake , and this snake sensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the water , and snatched the flower , and ate it . And then it cast off its skin , in the water , and swam down again , out of sight . And Gilgamesh sat down and wept , his tears ran down his face , and he said to Urshanabi the ferryman , " Was it for this that I worked so hard , is it for this that I forced out my heart 's blood ? For myself I have gained nothing  --  I do n't have it , a beast out of the earth has it now . I found a sign and I have lost it . " <p> The heavy bald head turned towards Gillian Perholt and the lashless eyelids slid blindly down over the eyeballs for a moment in what seemed to be exhaustion . The thick hands fumbled at the pockets of the fleece-lined jacket for a moment , as though the fingers wee those of Gilgamesh , searching for what he had lost . And Gillian 's inner eye was full of the empty snakeskin , a papery shadowy form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well into which the muscular snake had vigorously vanished . <p> ' What does it mean , my lady ? ' asked the old man . ' It means that Gilgamesh must die now  --  he has seen that he could grasp the thorn and the flower and live forever  --  but the snake took it just by chance , not to hurt him , but because it liked the sweetness . It is so sad to hold the sign and lose it , it is <p> sad story  --  because in most stories where you go to find something you bring it back after your struggles , I think , but here the beast , the creature , just took it , just by chance , after all the effort . They were a sad people , ma'am , very sad . Death hung over them . ' <p> When they came out into the light of day she gave him what Turkish money she had , which he looked over , counted , and put in his pocket . She could not tell if he thought it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head wrinkled as he considered it . The British Council driver was waiting with the cat ; she walked towards him . When she turned to say good-bye to the Mariner , he was no longer to be seen . <p> Turks are good at parties . The party in Izmir was made up of Orhan 's friends  --  scholars and writers , journalists and students . ' Smyrna , ' said Orhan , as they drove into the town , holding their noses as they went along the harbour-front with its stench of excrement , ' Smyma of the merchants , ' as they looked up at the quiet town on its conical hill . ' Smyma where we like to think Homer was born , the place most people agree he was probably born . ' <p> It was spring , the air was light and full of new sunshine . They ate stuffed peppers and vineleaves , kebabs and smoky aubergines in little restaurants ; they made excursions and ate roasted fishes at a trestle table set by a tiny harbour , looking at fishing boats that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They told each other stories . Orhan told of his tragi-comic battle with the official powers over his beard , which he had been required to shave before he was allowed to teach . A beard in modern Turkey is symbolic of religion or Marxism , neither acceptable . He had shaved his beard temporarily but now it flourished anew , like mown grass , Orhan said , even thicker and more luxuriant . The conversation moved to poets and politics : the exile of Halicarnassus , the imprisonment of the great Nazim Hikmet . Orhan recited Hikmet 's poem , ' Weeping willow ' , with its fallen rider and the drumming beat of the hooves of the red horsemen , vanishing at the gallop . And Leyla Serin recited Faruk Nafiz Camlibel 's Goksu , with its own weeping willow . <p> Whenever my heart would wander in Goksu The garden in my dreams falls on the wood . At dusk the roses seem a distant veil The phantom willow boughs a cloak and hood . <p> Bulbuls and hoopoes of a bygone age Retell their time-old ballads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing of Nedim with six-oared barque ... <p> And Gillian told the story of her encounter with the old soldier in the Anatolian museum . ' Maybe he was a djinn , ' said Orhan . ' A djinn in Turkish is spelled C-I-N and you can tell one , if you meet it , in its human form , because it is naked and hairless . They can take many forms but their human form is hairless . ' <p> ' He had a hairy coat , ' said Gillian , ' but he was hairless . His skin was ivory-yellow , beeswax colour , and he had no hair anywhere , ' <p> ' Certainly a djinn , ' said Orhan . <p> ' In that case , ' said the young Attila , who had spoken on ' Bajazet in the Harem ' , ' how do you explain the Queen of Sheba ? ' <p> ' What should I explain about her ? ' said Orhan . <p> ' Well , ' said Attila , ' in Islamic tradition , Solomon travelled from Mecca to Sheba to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs like a donkey because she was the daughter of a djinn . So Solomon asked her to marry him , and to please him she used various unguents and herbs to render the legs as smooth as a baby 's skin ... ' <p> ' Autres pays , autres moeurs , ' said Leyla Doruk . ' You ca n't pin down djinns . As for Dr Perholt 's naqqual , he seems to be related to the earth-spirit in the story of Camaralzaman , do n't you think so ? ' <p> They went also on an excursion to Ephesus . This is a white city risen , in part , from the dead : you can walk along a marble street where St Paul must have walked ; columns and porticoes , the shell of an elegant library , temples and caryatids are again upright in the spring sun . The young Attila frowned as they paced past the temple facades and said they made him shiver : Gillian thought he was thinking of the death of nations , but it turned out that he was thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when he said that , Gillian looked at the broken stones with fear too . <p> In the museum are two statues of the Artemis of Ephesus , whose temple , the Artemision , was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , rediscovered in the nineteenth century by a dogged and inspired English engineer , John Turtle Wood . The colossal Artemis is more austere , and like Cybele , the Magna Mater , turret-crowned , with a temple on he head , under whose arches sit winged sphinxes . Her body is a rising pillar : her haunches can be seen within its form but she wears like a skit the beasts of the field , the wood , the heavens , all geometrically arranged in quadrangles between carved stone ropes , in twos and threes : bulls , rams , antelopes , winged bulls , flying sphinxes with women 's breasts and lion-heads , winged men and huge hieratic bees , for the bee is her symbol , and the symbol of Ephesus . She is garlanded with flowers and fruit , all part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crook of her arm ( her hands are lost ) and her headdress or veil is made of ranks of winged bulls , like the genies at the gates in the Ankara museum . And before her she carries , as a date-palm carries dates , her triple row of full breasts , seven , eight , eight , fecundity in stone . The lesser Artemis , whom the Turks call Guzel Artemis and the French La Belle Artemis , stands in font of a brick wall and has a less Egyptian , more oriental , faintly smiling face . She too wears the beasts of earth and air like a garment , bulls and antelopes , winged bulls and sphinxes , with the lions couched below the rows of pendent breasts in their shadow . Her headdress too is woven of winged bulls , though her temple crown is lost . But she has her feet , which are side by side inside a reptilian frill or scallop or serpent-tail , and at these feet are honey-combed beehives . Her eyes are wide , and heavy lidded : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admired the goddess . Orhan bowed to her , and Leyla Doruk and Leyla Serin explained her cult to Gillian Perholt , how she was certainly really a much older goddess than the Greek Artemis or the Roman Diana , an Asian earth-goddess , Cybele , Astarte , Ishtar , whose temple was served by virgins and temple prostitutes , who combined extremes of abundant life and fierce slaughter , whose male priests castrated themselves in a frenzy of devotion , like those dying gods , Tammuz , Attis , Adonis , with whose blood the rivers ran red to the sea . The women wept for these dying divinities , said Leyla Serin . It was believed that Coleridge found his wonderful phrase , ' woman wailing for her demon lover ' , in descriptions of these ritual mournings . <p> There was a priest , said Leyla Doruk , the Megabyxus ; that is a Persian word , and it means set free by God . He was probably a foreign eunuch . There were three priestesses  --  the Virgin Priestess , the Novice , the Future Priestess and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priestesses were called Melissae , which is bees . And there were priests called the Acrobatae who walked on tiptoe , and priests called the Essenes , another non-Greek word , essen means king bee  --  the Greeks did n't know that the queen bee is a queen , but we know now .... <p> ' Her breasts are frightening , ' said Gillian Perholt . ' Like Medusa 's snakes , too much , but an orderly too much . ' <p> ' Some people now say the breasts are not breasts but eggs , ' said Attila . ' Symbols of rebirth . ' <p> ' They have to be beasts , ' said Gillian Perholt . ' You can not see this figure and not read those forms as breasts . ' <p> ' Some say , ' said Leyla Doruk , smiling , ' that they were bulls ' testicles , sacrificed to her , you know , hung round her in her honour , as the  --  the castrated priests '  --  parts  --  once were . ' <p> They were ripe and full and stony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' They are many things at once , as the sphinxes and winged bulls are many things at once . ' <p> ' You admire her , our goddess , ' said Leyla Doruk . <p> She is not yours , thought Gillian . You are latecomers . She is older and stronger . Then she thought : but she is more yours than mine , all the same . The brick wall behind the Guzel Artemis , the beautiful Artemis , was hung with plastic ivy , fading creamy in the sunlight . <p> The two Leylas stood with Gillian Perholt in front of the Guzel Artemis and each took her by one arm , laughing . <p> ' Now , Dr Perholt , ' said Leyla Osman , ' you must make a wish . For here , if you stand between two people with the same name , and wish , it will come true . ' <p> Leyla Doruk was large and flowing ; Leyla Serin was small and bird-like . Both had large dark eyes and lovely skins . They made Gillian Perholt feel hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ignoring these feelings . She said , laughing , ' I am enough to a narratologist to know that no good ever comes of making wishes . They have a habit of twisting the wishers to their own ends . ' <p> ' Only foolish wishes , ' said Leyla Serin . ' Only the uninstructed , who do n't think . ' <p> ' Like the peasant who saved a magic bird which gave him there wishes , and he wished for a suing of sausages in his pan , and they were there , and his wife said that that was a foolish wish , a stupid wish , a string of sausages with the whole world td wish for , and he was so mad at her , he wished the sausages would stick to he nose , and they did , and that was two wishes , and he had to use the third on detaching them . ' <p> For a moment this fictive Nordic peasant 's wife , decorated with sausage strings , was imaginatively present also before the goddess with her rows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Orhan . You are quite intelligent enough not to wish for anything silly . <p> ' In England , ' said Gillian , ' when we wish , when we cut our birthday-cakes , we scream out loud , to turn away the knife , I suppose . ' <p> ' You may scream if you want to , ' said Leyla Serin . <p> ' I am not in England , ' said Gillian Perholt . ' And it is not my birthday . So I shall not scream , I shall concentrate on being intelligent , as Orhan has commanded . ' <p> She closed her eyes , and concentrated , and wished , seeing the red light inside her eyelids , as so often before , hearing a faint drumming of blood in her ears . She made a precise and careful wish to be asked to give the keynote address at the Toronto Conference of Narratologists in the fall and added a wish for a first-class air-fare and a hotel with a swimming pool , as a kind of wishing-package , she explained to the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes again , and shook he head before the smiling Artemis . Everyone laughed . You looked so serious , they said , squeezing her arms before they let go , and laughing . <p> They walked through old-new Ephesus and came to the theatre . Orhan stood against the ruined stage and said something incantatory in Turkish which he then explained to Gillian was Dionysus ' first speech , his terrible , smiling , threatening speech at the beginning of The Bacchae . He then threw one arm over his shoulder and became cloaked and tall and stiffly striding where he had been supple and smiling and eastern . ' Listen , Gillian , ' he said : <p> I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul , freeze thy young blood Make thy two eyes like stars , start from their spheres , Thy knotted and combined locks to part . And each particular hair to stand on end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine . But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood . <p> ' Angels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , remembering the young Orhan stalking the English student stage ; thinking too of Mehmet the Conqueror , as Bellini saw him , eloquent , watchful and dangerous . <p> ' I was good , ' said Orhan , ' in those days . It was his part . Shakespeare himself played the Ghost . Did you know that , Attila ? When you speak these words you speak the words he spoke . ' <p> ' Not on this stage , ' said Attila . <p> ' Now , ' said Orhan , ' Now it is here . ' <p> Angels had made Gillian think of St Paul . Angels had sprung open St Paul 's prison in Ephesus . She had sat in Sunday school , hearing a fly buzzing against a smeared high window in the vestry and had hated the stories of St Paul and the other apostles because they were true , they were told to her as true stories , and this somehow stopped off some essential imaginative involvement with them , probably because she did n't believe them , if required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and Shakespeare : she saw Milton 's snake and the miraculous flying horse of the Thief of Baghdad , but St Paul 's angels rested under suspicion of being made-up because she had been told they were special because true . St Paul had come here to Ephesus to tell the people here that Artemis was not true , was not real , because she was a god made with hands . He had stood here , precisely here , in this theatre , she understood slowly ; this real man , a provincial interloper with a message , had stood here , where she now stood . She found this had to believe because St Paul had always seemed to her so cardboard , compared , when she met them later , to Dionysus , to Achilles , to Priam . But he had come here with his wrath against hand-made gods . He had changed the world . He had been a persecutor and had been blinded by light on the road to Damascus ( for that moment he was not cardboard , he was consumed by light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom he had not , in his human form , known . In Ephesus he had caused ' no small stir ' . His preaching had angered Demetrius , a silversmith , who made silver shrines for the goddess . And Demetrius stirred up the people of Ephesus against the saint , who claimed ' they be no gods which are made with hands ' and told them that the foreign preacher would not only set their craft at naught but also ' the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised , and her magnificence should be destroyed , whom all Asia and the world worshippeth . ' <p> ' And when they heard these sayings , they were full of wrath , and cried out , saying , Great is Diana of the Ephesians . ' <p> ' And the whole city was filled with confusion : and having caught Gaius and Artistarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul 's companions in travel , they rushed with one accord into the theatre . ' <p> ' And there for two hours they continued to cry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the uproar , which was calmed by the town clerk , Paul left the city of Ephesus and set off for Macedonia . <p> So the bristling apostle was beaten by commerce and the power of the goddess . <p> ' You know , ' said Leyla Doruk , ' that your Virgin Mary came and died here . It is not certain , as it is not certain that Home was born in Izmir , but it is said to be so , and her house was discovered because of a sick German lady in the nineteenth century who saw it in visions , the house and the hills , and when they came to look it was there , or so they say . We call it Panaya Kapulu , there is a Christian church too . She came with John , they say , and died here . ' <p> At a nightclub in Istanbul once , Gillian had been shocked , without quite knowing why , to find one of those vacant , sweetly pink and blue church Virgins , life-size , standing as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you might find a many-handed Hindu deity or a plaster Venus in an equivalent occidental club . Now suddenly , she saw a real bewildered old woman , a woman with a shriveled womb and empty eyes , a woman whose son had been cruelly and very slowly slaughtered before her eyes , shuffling through the streets of Ephesus , waiting quietly for death until it came . And then , afterwards , this old woman , this real dead old woman had in part become the mother goddess , the Syria Dea , the crowned Queen . She was suddenly aware of every inch of her own slack and dying skin . She thought of the stone eyes of the goddess , of her dangerous dignity , of her ambiguous plump breasts , dead balls , intact eggs , wreathed round her in triumph and understood that real-unreal was not the point , that the goddess was still , and always had been , and in the foreseeable future would be more alive , more energetic , infinitely more powerful than she herself , Gillian Perholt , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's children , and their children 's children and smile , when they themselves were scattered atomies . <p> And when she thought this , standing amongst a group of smiling friends in the centre of the theatre at Ephesus , she experienced again the strange stoppage of her own life that had come with the vision of Patient Griselda . She put out a hand to Orhan and could move no more ; and it seemed that she was in a huge buzzing dark cloud , sparking with flashes of fire , and she could smell flowers , and her own blood , and she could hear rushing and humming in her veins , but she could not move a nerve or a muscle . And after a moment , a kind of liquid sob rose in her throat , and Orhan saw the state she was in , and put an arm round her shoulder , and steadied her , until she came to herself . <p> In the aeroplane on the way back to Istanbul , Orhan said to Gillian : <p> ' Forgive me , are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gillian , which was in many senses true . But she knew she must answer him . ' I do truly mean , I feel more alive now than ever before . But lately I 've had a sense of my fate  --  my death , that is  --  waiting for me , manifesting itself from time to time , to remind me it 's there . It is n't a battle . I do n't fight it off . It takes charge for a moment or two , and then lets go again , and steps back . The more alive I am , the more suddenly it comes . ' <p> ' Should you see a doctor ? ' <p> ' When I am so well , Orhan ? ' <p> ' I am delighted to see you so well , ' said Orhan . The plane came down into Istanbul and the passengers began a decorous and delightful clapping , applause perhaps for the pilot 's skill , applause perhaps for another successful evasion of fate . <p> In Istanbul Orhan Rifat , a very happily married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled in for a few days in the Peri Palas Hotel , which was not the famous Peri Palas , in the old European city across the Golden Horn , but a new hotel , of the kind Gillian liked best , combining large hard beds , elegant mirrored bathrooms , lifts and a swimming pool with local forms and patterns  --  tiled fountains , Turkish tiles with pinks and cornflowers in the bathrooms , carpets woven with abundant silky flowers in the small sitting rooms and writing rooms . It was constructed around a beehive of inner courtyards , with balconies rising one above the other , and silky translucent white-gold curtains behind functional double-glazed balcony doors . Gillian had developed a late passion for swimming . Flying distorts the human body  --  the middle-aged female body perhaps particularly  --  the belly balloons , the ankles become cushions of flesh and air , the knees round into puffballs , toes and fingers are swollen and shiny . Gillian had learned never to look in the mirror on arrival , for what stated out at her was a fleshy monster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little she felt inclined to exert herself , for what air pressure inflates , water pressure delicately makes weightless and vanishing . The pool at the Peri Palas was empty on the day of Gillian 's arrival , and very satisfactory , if small . It was underground , a large tank , tiled in a dark emerald green , lit from within by gold-rimmed lamps , and the walls of its cavern were tiled with blue and green tiles covered with chrysanthemums and carnations , edged with gold mosaic , glinting and gleaming in the golden light . Oh the bliss , said Gillian to herself as she extended her sad body along the green rolls of swaying liquid and felt it vanish , felt her blood and nerves become pure energy , moved forward with a ripple like a swimming serpent . Little waves of her own making lapped her chin in this secret cistern ; her ears were full of the soft whisper and plash of water , her eyes were wide upon green and green , woven with networks of swaying golden light . She basked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on her back and let her hair fan on the glassy curves . The nerves unknotted , the heart and lungs settled and pumped , the body was alive and joyful . <p> When Orhan took her to Topkapi her body was still comfortable from the swimming , which her skin remembered as the two of them looked down from the Sultan 's upper window on the great dark tank under cedars where once the women of the harem swam together in the sun . In the harem too , was the Sultan 's bath , a quite different affair , a central box inside a series of carved boxes and cupboards inside the quarters of the Valide Sultan , his mother , where his nakedness could be guarded by many watchful eyes from assassin 's knives . Here too , as in Ephesus , Gillian Perholt struggled with the passions of real stories . Here in the cages the sons of the sultans had waited for the eunuchs with the silken cords that would end their lives and make the throne safe for the chosen one . Here intriguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drowned ; here captives , or unsatisfactory servants , had been beheaded for a whim of an absolute ruler . How did they live with such fear ? She said to Orhan : <p> ' It is as you said of Shahriyar and I said of Walter  --  there must be a wonderful pleasure for some people in being other people 's fates and destinies . Perhaps it gave them the illusion that their own fates too were in their own hands  --  ' <p> ' Perhaps , ' said Orhan . ' Perhaps life mattered less to them , their own or anyone else 's . ' <p> ' Do you really think they thought that ? ' <p> ' No , ' said Orhan , looking around the empty maze of hidden rooms and secret places . ' No , not really . We like to say that . They believed in a future life . We ca n't imagine that . ' <p> Showing her found Istanbul , nevertheless , Orhan became more Turkish . Before the great gold throne of Murat III studded with emeralds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' We were a nomadic people . We came over the steppes from Mongolia , from China . Our thrones are portable treasures , our throne-rooms resemble tents , we put our skill into small things , daggers and bowls and cups . ' She remembered the rhythms of his recitation of the poem of the red horsemen . <p> In the Haghia Sophia she had her third encounter with Fate , or with something . Haghia Sophia is a confusing place , echoing and empty , hugely domed and architecturally uncertain , despite its vast and imposing space : it has been church and mosque and modern museum ; it has minarets and patches , ghosts , of ruined gold mosaics of Byzantine emperors and the Christian mother and child . The emperor Justinian built it from eclectic materials , collecting pillars and ornaments from temples in Greece and Egypt , including pillars from the temple of the goddess in Ephesus . It could feel  --  Gillian had expected it to feel  --  like a meeting-place of cultures , of East and West , the Christian Church and Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty exhausted barn , exhausted by battle and pillage and religious rage . Whatever had been there had gone , had fled long ago , Gillian felt , and Orhan too showed no emotion , but returned to his European academic self , pointing out the meanings of the mosaics and talking of his own new thoughts about the absurdities of the theories of Marcuse which had been all the rage in the sixties , when they began to teach . ' There is a curious pillar here , ' he said vaguely , ' somewhere of other , with a hole of some sort , where people wish ; you might like to see that , if I can find it . The stone is worn away by people touching it , I forget what it does , but you might like to see it . ' <p> ' It does n't matter , ' said Gillian . <p> ' They put a brass casing round the magic stone to preserve it , ' said Orhan . ' But the pilgrims have worn it away , they have eaten into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stone . Now where is it , I should be able to find it . It is like wearing away with waterdrops , wearing away with faith , I find that quite interesting , I wish I could remember what it does . ' <p> When they came to it , there was a family already clustered round it , a Pakistani father and his wife and two daughters , richly beautiful in saris , one pink and gold , one peacock and flame , one blue and silver . They had found the pillar with the hole and its brass casing , and the three women were clustered round it , stroking , putting their hands in and out , chattering like subdued birds . The father , dignified in his black coat , approached Orhan , and asked if he spoke English . Orhan said yes , and was asked to help translate an account of the pillar from a French-Turkish guidebook . <p> Whilst he did this , the three women , in their fluttering silk , turned laughing to Gillian Perholt , and stretched out three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by her sleeve , by her hand , towards the pillar , laughing softly . <p> They patted Dr Perholt 's shoulders , they put arms around her and pushed and pulled , smiling and laughing , they took her hand in theirs with strong , wiry grips and inserted it into the hole , showing her in mime what she must do , turn her hand in the hole , touching the inside rim , round , round , round , three times . She pulled back instinctively , out of an English hygienic horror of something so much touched by so many , and out of a more primitive fear , of something clammy and moist and nasty in the dark inside . But the women insisted ; they were surprisingly forceful . There was liquid of some kind in there , some pool of something in the stem of the pillar . Dr Perholt 's skin crawled and the women laughed , and Orhan recited the story of the pillar in English to the other man . Apparently , he said , it had been touched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his power into it . The water inside the pillar was efficacious for diseases of vision and for fertility . The women laughed more loudly , clustering round Dr Perholt . The father told Orhan how he had made pilgrimage to all the holy shrines of Islam ; he had travelled far and seen much . He supposed Orhan too , had made pilgrimages . Orhan nodded , grave and non-committal ; he was interested . The West was evil , said the respectable black-coated pilgrim . Evil , decadent , and sliding into darkness . But power was arising . There would be a jihad . True religion would bring the cleansing sword and destroy the filth and greed and corruption of the dying West , and a religious world would be established in its ashes ; these things were not only possible , they were already happening . The seeds wee sown , the sparks were set , the field of spears would spring up , the fire would consume . This was what he said , this paterfamilias , standing in Haghia Sophia whose stones had run with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpses , whose spirit had died , Gillian Perholt felt , but maybe felt because she could not feel the new spirit , which spoke to this family , and in them filled her with fear . Orhan , she saw , was in some way enjoying himself . He prolonged the conversation , nodding gravely , inserting mild questions  --  ' you have seen signs , mn ? '  --  making no move to change his interlocutor 's impression that he was a good Muslim , in a mosque . <p> His family came everywhere with him , said the pilgrim . They like to see new places . And she , does she speak English ? <p> It was clear that Gillian had been taken for a quiet Muslim wife . She had been standing two paces behind Orhan as he cast about for the magic pillar . Orhan replied gravely : <p> ' She is English . She is a visiting professor . An eminent visiting professor . ' <p> Orhan , a child of Ataturk 's new world , was enjoying himself . Ataturk had emancipated women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , powerful people , thinking teachers . Orhan liked drama , and he had made a nice little revelatory clash . The Pakistani gentleman was not happy . He and Gillian looked at each other , both , she thought , remembering things he had said a moment ago about London being a sewer of decay and the Commonwealth a dead body , putrefying and shriveling away to nothing . She could not meet the Pakistani 's eye ; she was English and embarrassed for him . He could not meet her eye . She was a woman , and should not have been there , with a man who was not her husband , in a museum that was also a mosque . He gathered his flock  --  who still smiled at Gillian , fluttering their elegant fingers in farewell . ' Hfmph , ' said Orhan . ' Istanbul is a meeting-place for many cultures . You did n't like the pillar , Gillian ! Your face was very funny , very ladylike . ' <p> ' I do n't like Haghia Sophia , ' said Gillian . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Wisdom , I like it that she is wise and female , I expected to feel  --  something  --  in her church . And there is a wet hole for fertility wishes . In a pillar that might have come from the Temple of Artemis . ' <p> ' Not that pillar , I think , ' said Orhan . <p> ' If I was a postmodernist punster , ' said Gillian , ' I would make something of Haghia Sophia . She has got old , she has turned into a Hag . But I ca n't , because I respect etymologies , it means holy . Hag is my word , a northern word , nothing to do with here . ' <p> ' You have said it now , ' said Orhan . ' Even if you repudiate it . Lots of American students here do think hag is hag . They get excited about crones . ' <p> ' I do n't , ' said Gillian . <p> ' No , ' said Orhan , not revealing what he himself thought about hags and crones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good for the souls of western women . And eastern . And men like it too . ' <p> It was true that the Grand Bazaar was livelier and brighter than the vast cavern of Haghia Sophia . Here was a warren of arcades , of Aladdin 's caves full of lamps and magical carpets , of silver and brass and gold and pottery and tiles . Here and there behind a shop-front , seated in an armchair at a bench surrounded by dangling lamps and watershakers from the baths , or sitting cross-legged on a bale of carpets amongst a tent of carpets , Orhan had ex-students who brought cups of Turkish coffee , tulip-shaped glasses of rose tea to Gillian , and displayed their wares . The carpet-seller had written a Ph.D . on Tristram Sandy , and now travelled into Iraq , Iran , Afghanistan , bringing back carpets on journeys made by camel , by jeep , into the mountains . He showed Gillian pallid kilims in that year 's timid Habitat colours , pale 1930s eau-de-nil and bois-de-rose with a sad null grey . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark bright blues , the crimsons and scarlets , the golds and rusts of the old carpets with their creamy blossoms , their trees full of strange birds and flowers . The West is fickle , said Bulent the carpet-seller , they say they want these insipid colours this year , and the women in India and Iran buy the wool and the silk , and the next year , when the carpets are made , they want something else , black and purple and orange , and the women are ruined , their profit is lost , heaps of carpets lie round and rot . I think you will like this carpet , said Bulent , pouring coffee ; it is a wedding carpet , a dowry carpet , to hang on the wall of a nomad 's tent . Here is the tree of life , crimson and black on midnight blue . This you like . Oh yes , said Gillian , seeing the dark woven tree against the yellows and whites of her Primrose Hill room , now he alone . The woman , whoever she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subtle . I ca n't haggle , said Gillian to Orhan , I 'm English . You would be surprised , said Orhan , at some English people 's skill in that art . But Bulent is my student , and he will give you a fair price , for love of Tristram Sandy . And suddenly Gillian felt well again , full of life and singing with joy , away from the puddle in the pillar and the brooding Hag , hidden away in an Aladdin 's cave made of magic carpets with small delightful human artefacts , an unknown woman 's wedding carpet , sentimental Sterne 's monumental fantasia on life before birth , black-brown coffee poured from a bright copper pan , tasting rich and almost , but not quite , unbearably strong and sweet . <p> Another of Orhan 's students had a little shop in the central square of the market-maze , Ic Bedesten , a shop whose narrow walls were entirely hung with pots , pans , lamps , bottles , leather objects , old tools whose purpose was unguessable , chased daggers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flasks , curling tongs . <p> ' I will give you a present , ' said Orhan . ' A present to say good-bye . ' <p> ( He was leaving the next day for Texas where a colloquium of narratologists was studying family sagas in Dallas . Gillian had a talk to give at the British Council and three more days in Istanbul . ) <p> ' I will give you the shadow puppets , Karagoz. and Hacivat , and here is the magic bird , the Simurgh , and here is a woman involved with a dragon , I think she may be a djinee , with a little winged demon on her shoulders , you might like her . ' <p> The small figures were wrapped carefully in scarlet tissue . Whilst this was happening Gillian poked about on a bench and found a bottle , a very dusty bottle amongst an apparently unsorted pile of new/old things . It was a flask with a high neck , that fitted comfortably into the palms of her hands , and had a glass stopper like a miniature dome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white stripes moving around it . Gillian collected glass paperweights : she liked glass in general , for its paradoxical nature , translucent as water , heavy as stone , invisible as air , solid as earth . Blown with human breath in a furnace of fire . As a child she had loved to read of glass balls containing castles and snowstorms , though in reality she had always found these disappointing and had transferred her magical attachment to the weights in which coloured forms and carpets of geometric flowers shone perpetually and could be made to expand and contract as the sphere of glass turned in her fingers in the light . She liked to take a weight back from every journey , if one could be found , and had already bought a Turkish weight , a cone of glass like a witch 's hat , fought to touch , greenish-transparent like ice , with the concentric circles , blue , yellow , white , blue , of the eye which repels the evil eye , at the base . <p> ' What is this ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the flask from her , and rubbed at the dust with a finger . <p> ' I 'm not an expert in glass , ' he said , ' It could be cesm-i bulbul . Or it could be fairly recent Venetian glass . Cesm-i bulbul means nightingale 's eye . There was a famous Turkish glass workshop at Incirkoy  --  round about 1845 I think  --  made this famous Turkish glass , with this spiral pattern of opaque blue and white stripes , or red sometimes , I think . I do n't know why it is called eye of the nightingale . Perhaps nightingales have eyes that are transparent and opaque . In this country we were obsessed with nightingales . Our poetry is full of nightingales . ' <p> ' Before pollution , ' said Orhan , ' before television , everyone came out and walked along the Bosphorus and in all the gardens , to hear the first nightingales of the year . It was very beautiful . Like the Japanese and the cherry blossom . A whole people , walking quietly in the spring weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkish and Orhan translated . <p> In the woods full of evening the nightingales are silent The river absorbs the sky and its fountains Birds return to the indigo shores from the shadows A scarlet bead of sunshine in their beaks . <p> Gillian said , ' I must have this . Because the word and the thing do n't quite match , and I love both of them . But if it is cesm-i bulbul it will be valuable ... ' <p> ' It probably is n't , ' said Feyyaz . ' It 's probably recent Venetian . Our glassmakers went to Venice in the eighteenth century to learn , and the Venetians helped us to develop the techniques of the nineteenth century . I will sell it to you as if it were Venetian , because you like it , and you may imagine it is cesm-i bulbul and perhaps it will be , is , that is . ' <p> ' Feyyaz wrote his doctoral thesis on Yeats and Byzantium , ' said Orhan . <p> Gillian gave the stopper an experimental twist , but it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . So the nightingale's-eye bottle too was wrapped in scarlet tissue , and more rose tea was sipped , and Gillian returned to her hotel . That evening there was a farewell dinner in Orhan 's house , with music and raki and generous beautiful food . And the next day , Gillian was alone in her hotel room . <p> Time passes differently in the solitude of hotel rooms . The mind expands , but lazily , and the body contracts in its bright box of space . Because one may think of anything at all , one thinks for a long time of nothing . Gillian in hotel rooms was always initially tempted by channel-surfing on the television ; she lay amongst crimson and creamy roses on her great bed and pointed the black lozenge with its bright buttons imperiously at the screen . Transparent life flickered and danced across it : Gillian could make it boom with sound , the rush of traffic and violins , voices prophesying war and voices dripping with the promise of delectable yogurt/Oranginal tutti-frutti/Mars Bars frozen stiff . Or she could leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Reagan , smiling and mouthing , glassy in the glass box between the glassy wings of his speech , or an aeroplane falling in flames on a mountain , fact or stunt ? a priest driving a racing-car round a corniche , narrative or advertisement ? Turks discussing the fullness and fatness of tomatoes in a field , more new cars , in cornfields , up mountains , falling from skyscrapers , a houri applying a tongue tip to raspberry fudge and sighing , an enormous tsetse fly expending enormous energy in puncturing a whole screenful of cowflesh , jeeps full of dirty soldiers in helmets brandishing machine-guns , trundling through dusty streets , fact or drama , which ? tennis . <p> Tennis in French , from courts like red deserts , tennis from Monte Carlo where it was high noon , under the sun past which Istanbul had begun to roll two hours ago , tennis male and it appeared , live , on a channel where nothing ever happened but the human body ( and mind , indeed , also ) stretched , extended , driven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative . Dr Perholt was accustomed to say , in her introductory talks on narratology , that whoever designed the rules and the scoring-system of tennis was a narrative genius of the first order , comparable to those ancient storytellers who arranged animal-helpers in threes and thought up punishments for disregarded prohibitions . For the mote even the combat , said Dr Perholt , the more difficult the scoring makes it for one combatant to succeed . At deuce , at six-all , the stakes are raised , not one but two points are needed to assure victory , not one but two games , thus ensuring the maximum tension and the maximum pleasure to the watchers . Tennis in the glass box she loved as she had loved bedtime stories as a child . She loved the skill of the cameramen  --  the quick shot of a sweating face in a rictus of strain , the balletic shot of the impossibly precise turning feet , the slow lazy repeat of the lung-bursting leap , taken at the speed with which a leaf falls slowly through the air , slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make these heavy muscled men hang at rest in their billowing shirts . She had only come to love tennis so much when she was beyond being expected to take part in it ; when her proper function was only as audience . Now she delighted in its geometry , the white lines of increasing difficulty , of hope and despair , the acid gold sphere of the ball , the red dust flying , the woven chequered barrier of the net . She had her narrative snobbisms . A live match was always more enticing than a recorded one , even if it was impossible for her to find out first the score of the latter , for someone , somewhere , new who had won , the tense was past , and thus the wonderful open-endedness of a story which is most beautifully designed towards satisfactory closure but is still undecided , would be lost , would be a cheat . For darkness might descend on a live match , or the earth open . A live match was live , was a story in progress towards an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly come . And in the fact of the almost was the delight . <p> A live match ( Becker-Leconte ) was promised within an hour . She had time for a shower , she judged , a good hot shower , and then she could sit and dry slowly and watch the two men run . So she turned on the shower , which was large and brassy , behind a glass screen at one end of the bath , an enclosing screen of pleasing engraved climbing roses with little birds sitting amongst their thorny stems . It had a pleasant brass frame , the glass box . The water was a little cloudy , and a little brassy itself in colour , but it was hot , and Gillian disported herself in its jets , soaped her breasts , shampooed he hair , looked ruefully down at what it was better not to look at , the rolls of her midriff , the sagging muscles of her stomach . She remembered , as she reached for her towel , how perhaps ten years ago she had looked complacently at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts and had thought herself well-preserved , unexceptionable . She had tried to imagine how this nice , taut , flexible skin would crimp and wrinkle and fall and had not been able to . It was her skin , it was herself , and there was no visible reason why it should not persist . She had known intellectually that it must , it must give way , but its liveliness then had given her the lie . And now it was all going , the eyelids had soft little folds , the edges of the lips were fuzzed , if she put on lipstick it ran in little threads into the surrounding skin . <p> She advanced naked towards the bathroom mirror in room 43 in the Peri Palas Hotel . The mirror was covered with shifting veils of steam , amongst which , vaguely , Gillian saw her death advancing towards her , its hair streaming dark and liquid , its eyeholes dark smudges , its mouth open in its liquescent face in fear of their convergence . She dropped her head sadly , turned aside from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its transparent sheath of plastic . There were white towelling slippers in the cupboard with Peri Palas written on them in gold letters . She made herself a loose turban of a towel and thus solidly enveloped she remembered the cesm-i bulbul bottle and decided to run it under the tap , to bring the glass to life . She took it out of its wrappings  --  it was really very dusty , almost clay-encrusted  --  and carried it into the bathroom where she turned on the mixer-tap in the basin , made the water warm , blood-heat , and held the bottle under the jet , turning it round and round . The glass became blue , threaded with opaque white canes , cobalt-blue , darkly bright , gleaming and wonderful . She turned it and tuned it , rubbing the tenacious dust-spots with thumbs and fingers , and suddenly it gave a kind of warm leap in her hand , like a frog , like a still-beating heart in the hands of a surgeon . She gripped and clasped and steadied , and her own heart took a fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . But all that happened was that the stopper , with a faint glassy grinding , suddenly flew out of the neck of the flask and fell tinkling but unbroken , into the basin . And out of the bottle in her hands came a swarming , an exhalation , a fast-moving dark stain which made a high-pitched buzzing sound and smelled of woodsmoke , of cinnamon , of sulphur , of something that might have been incense , of something that was not leather , but was ? The dark cloud gathered and turned and flew in a great paisley or comma out of the bathroom . I am seeing things , thought Dr Perholt , following , and found she could not follow , for the bathroom door was blocked by what she slowly made out to be an enormous foot , a foot with five toes as high as she was , surmounted by yellow horny toenails , a foot encased in skin that was olive-coloured , laced with gold , like snakeskin , not scaly but somehow mailed . It was between transparent and solid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very hot to the touch , not hot as a coal but considerably hotter than the water in which she had been washing the bottle . It was dry and slightly electric . A vein beat inside the ankle , a green-gold tube encasing an almost emerald liquid . <p> Gillian stood and considered the foot . Anything with a foot that size , if at all proportionate , could not be contained in one hotel room . Where was the rest ? As she thought this , she heard sounds , which seemed to be speech of some kind , deep , harsh , but musical , expletives perhaps , in a language she could n't identify . She put the stopper back in the bottle , clutching it firmly , and waited . <p> The foot began to change shape . At first it swelled and then it diminished a little , so that Gillian could have squeezed round it , but thought it more prudent not to try . It was now the size of a large armchair , and was drawn back , still diminishing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was still muttering , in its incomprehensible speech . Gillian came out and saw the djinn , who now took up half her large room , curled around on himself like a snake , with his huge head and shoulders pushing against the ceiling , his arms stretched round inside two walls , and his feet and body wound over her bed and trailing into the room . He seemed to be wearing a green silk tunic , not too clean , and not long enough , for she could see the complex heap of his private parts in the very centre of her rosy bed . Behind him was a great expanse of shimmering many-coloured feathers , peacock feathers , parrot feathers , feathers from birds of Paradise , which appeared to be part of a cloak that appeared to be part of him , but was not wings that sprouted in any conventional way from shoulder-blade or spine . Gillian identified the last ingredient of his smell , as he moved his cramped members to look down on her . It was a male smell , a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oval , and completely hairless . He had huge bruised-green oval eyelids over eyes sea-green flecked with malachite . He had high cheekbones and an imperious hooked nose , and his mouth was wide and sculpted like Egyptian pharaohs ' . <p> In one of his huge hands was the television , on whose pearly screen , on the red dust , Boris Becker and Henri Leconte rushed forward , jumped back , danced , plunged . The smack of the tennis ball could be head , and the djinn had turned one of his large , elegantly carved ears , to listen . <p> He spoke to Gillian . <p> She said , ' I do n't suppose you speak English . ' <p> He repeated his original remark . Gillian said , <p> ' Francais ? Deutsch ? Espanol ? Portugues ? ' She hesitated . She could not remember the Latin for Latin , and was not at all sure she could converse in that language . ' Latin , ' she said finally . <p> Je sais le Francais , ' said the djinn . Italiano anche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ francais , ' said Gillian . ' I am more fluent in that language . ' <p> ' Good , ' said the djinn in French . He said , ' I can learn quickly , what is your language ? ' <p> ' Anglais ' <p> ' Smaller would be better , ' he said , changing tack . ' It was agreeable to expand . I have been inside that bottle since 1850 by your reckoning . ' <p> ' You look cramped , ' said Gillian , reaching for the French words , in here . ' <p> The djinn considered the tennis players . <p> ' Everything is relative . These people are extremely small . I shall diminish somewhat . ' <p> He did so , not all at once , so that for a moment the now only slightly larger-than-life being was almost hidden behind the mound of his private parts , which he than shrank and tucked away . It was almost a form of boasting . He was now curled on Gillian 's bed , only one and a half times as large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , ' said the djinn , ' for this release . I am empowered , indeed required , to grant you three wishes on that account . If there is anything you desire . ' <p> ' Are there limits , ' asked the narratologist , ' to what I may wish for ? ' <p> ' An unusual question , ' said the djinn . He was still somewhat distracted by the insect-like drama of Boris Becker and Henri Leconte . ' In fact different djinns have different powers . Some can only grant small things  --  ' <p> ' Like sausages  --  ' ' A believe  --  a believing djinn  --  would find it repugnant to grant anyone of your religion pork sausages . But they are possible . There are laws of the praeternatural within which we work , all of us , which can not be broken . You may not , for instance , wish to have all your wishes granted in perpetuity . Three is three , a number of power . You may not wish for eternal life , for it is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be immortal . I can not by magic hold together your atomies , which will dissolve  --  ' <p> He said , ' It is good to speak again , even in this unaccustomed tongue . Can you tell me what these small men are made of , and what they are at ? It resembles royal tennis as it was played in the days of Suleiman the Magnificent  --  ' <p> ' It is called " lawn tennis " in my language . Tennis sur gazon . As you can see , this is being played on clay . I like to watch it . The men , ' she found herself saying . ' are very beautiful . ' <p> ' Indeed , ' agreed the djinn . ' How have you enclosed them ? The atmosphere here is full of presences I do not understand it is all bustling and crowded with  --  I can not find a word in my language or your own , that is , your second tongue  --  electrical emanations of living beings , and not only living beings but fruits and flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelling figures I can barely seize , like motes in the invisible air  --  something terrible has been done to my space  --  to exterior space since my incarceration  --  I have trouble in holding this exterior body together , for all the currents of power are so picked at and intruded upon ... Are these men magicians , or are you a witch , that you have them in a box ? ' <p> ' No , it is science . It is natural science . It is television . It is done with light waves and sound waves and cathode rays  --  I do n't know how it is done , I am only a literary scholar , we do n't know much , I 'm afraid  --  we use it for information and amusement . Most people in the world now see these boxes , I suppose . ' <p> ' Six-all , premire manche , ' said the television . ' Jeu decisif : Service Becker . ' <p> The djinn frowned . <p> ' I am a djinn of some power , ' he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would you like a homunculus of your own ? ' <p> ' I have three wishes , ' said Dr Perholt cautiously . ' I do not want to expend one of them on the possession of a tennis player . ' <p> ' Entendu , ' said the djinn . ' You are an intelligent and cautious woman . You may wish when you will and the praeternatural laws require me to remain at you service until all three wishes have been made . Lesser djinns would tempt you into making your wishes rapidly and foolishly , for their own ends , but I am God-fearing and honourable ( despite which I have spent much of my long life shut up in bottles ) , and I will not do that . All the same , I shall attempt to catch one of these travelling butterflies . They are spread along the waves of the atmosphere  --  not as we are when we travel  --  in the waves  --  I should be able to concentrate one  --  to move the matter as well as the emanation  --  the pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensify  --  I could easily wish him here but I will , I will have him along his own trajectory  --  so  --  and so  --  ' <p> A small Boris Becker , sandy-browed , every gold hair on his golden body gleaming sweat , was standing on the chest of drawers , perhaps twice the size of his television image , which was frozen in mid-stroke on the screen . He blinked his sandy lashes over his blue eyes and looked around , obviously unable to see more than a blur around him . <p> ' Scheibe , ' said the tiny Becker . ' Scheibe und scheibe . Was ist mit mir ? ' <p> ' I could manifest us to him , ' said the djinn . ' He would be afeard . ' <p> ' Put him back . He will lose the set . ' <p> ' I could expand him . Life-size . We could speak to him . ' <p> ' Put him back . It is n't fair . ' <p> ' You do n't want him ? ' <p> ' Scheibe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't . ' <p> The Becker on the screen was frozen into an attitude , his racket raised , his head back , one foot lifting . Henri Leconte advanced towards the net . The commentator announced that Becker had had a seizure , which delighted the djinn , who had indeed seized him . ' Scheibe , ' said the forlorn small Becker in the bedroom . ' Return him , ' said Dr Perholt imperiously , adding quickly , ' That is not one of my three wishes , you must do what seems to you best , but you must understand that you are disappointing millions of people , all round the world , interrupting this story  --  I 'm sorry , deformation professionelle , I should say , this game  --  ' <p> ' Why are your homunculi not three-dimensional ? ' asked the djinn . <p> ' I do n't know . ' We ca n't do that . We may learn . You seem to understand it better than I do , however long you have been in that bottle . Please put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said the djinn with grave gallantly . He picked up the mannikin-Becker , twisted him rapidly like a top , murmured something , and the Becker on the screen collapsed on the court in a heap . <p> ' You have hurt him . ' said Gillian accusingly . <p> ' It is to be hoped not , ' said the djinn with an uncertain note . Becker in Monte Carlo got up unsteadily and was escorted off the court , his hands to his head . <p> ' They will not be able to continue , ' said Gillian crossly , and then put her hand to her mouth in amazement , that a woman with a live djinn on her bed should still be interested in the outcome of a tennis match , only part of which she had seen . <p> ' You cold wish him well , ' said the djinn , ' but he will probably be well anyway . More than probably , almost certainly . You must wish for your heart 's desire . ' <p> ' I wish , ' said Gillian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I last really liked it , if you can do that . ' <p> The great green eyes settled on her stout figure in its white robe and turban . <p> ' I can do that , ' he said , ' I can do that . If you are quite sure that that is what you most desire . I can make your cells as they were , but I can not delay your Fate . ' <p> ' It is courteous of you to tell me that . And yes , it is what I desire . It is what I have desired hopelessly every day these last ten years , whatever else I may have desired . ' <p> ' And yet , ' said the djinn , ' you are well enough as you are , in my opinion . Amplitude , madame , is desirable . ' <p> ' Not in my culture . And moreover , there is the question of temporal decay . ' <p> ' That I suppose , but do not wholly understand sympathetically . We are made of fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and return to it . ' <p> He raised his hand and pointed at her , one finger lazily extended , a little like Michelangelo 's Adam . <p> She felt a fierce contraction in the walls of her belly , in her loose womb . <p> ' I am glad to see you prefer ripe women to green girls , ' said the djinn . ' I too am of that opinion . But your ideal is a little meager . Would you not care to be rounder ? ' <p> ' Excuse me , ' said Gillian , suddenly modest , and retreated into the bathroom , where she opened her robe and saw in the demisted mirror a solid and unexceptionable thirty-five-year-old woman , whose breasts were full but not softened , whose stomach was taut , whose thighs were smooth , whose nipples were round and rosy . Indeed the whole of this serviceable and agreeable body was flushed deep rose , as though she had been through a fire , or a steam bath . Her appendix scar was still there , and the mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle hiding under the stairs from an air raid in 1944 . She studied her face in the mirror ; it was not beautiful but it was healthy and lively and unexceptionable ; her neck was a clean column and her teeth , she was happy to see and feel , more numerous , more securely planted . She undid the coiled towel and her hair sprang out , damp , floppy , long and unfaded . I can go in the streets , she said to herself , and still be recognisably who I am , in my free and happy life ; only I shall feel better , I shall like myself more . That was an intelligent wish , I shall not regret it . She brushed out her hair , and went back to the djinn , who was lolling on the bedspread , watching Boris Becker , who had lost the first set , and was ranging the court like a tiger in the beginning of the second . The djinn had also helped himself to the glossy shopping magazines which lay in the drawer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the Koran , was also there . From these he appeared to have absorbed the English language by some kind of cerebral osmosis . <p> ' Hmn , ' he said in that language , " Who is she that looketh forth as the morning , fair as the moon , clear as the sun , and terrible as an army with banners ? This is your language , I can learn its rules quickly , I find . Are you pleased , madame , with the outcome of your wish ? We have a little sister and she hath no breasts : what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for ? I see from these images that in this time you prefer your ladies without breasts , like boys . A curious form of asceticism , if that is what is , or perversity possibly , it may be . I am not a djinn who ever needed to lurk in bathhouses to catch young boys from behind . I have consorted with ladies of all kinds , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wee like clusters of grapes and ripe pomegranates , whose neck was a tower of ivory and the smell of whose nose was like apples . A boy is a boy and a woman is a woman , my lady . But these images have lovely eyes , they are skillful with the kohl . ' <p> ' If you consorted with the Queen of Sheba , ' said the scholar , ' how did you come to be shut in what I believe is at the earliest a nineteenth-century bottle , cesm-i bulbul , if not Venetian ? ' <p> ' Certainly cesm-i bulbul , ' said the djinn . ' Freshly made and much prized by its owner , the beautiful Zefir , wife of Mustafa Emin Bey , in Smyrna . I came into that bottle through a foolish accident and a too-great fondness for the conversation of women . That was my third incarceration : I shall be more careful in the future . I am happy to tell you my history , whilst you decide upon your two remaining wishes , but I am also curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow , and how do you come to be inhabiting this splendid apartment with flowing waters in the Peri Palas as your shining books tell me this place is called ? What I know of England is little and unfriendly . I know the tale of the pale slaves from the island in the north of whom a Roman bishop said " Non Angli sed angeli . " And I know about Bisnismen , from the conversation in the caravanserai in Smyrna . You are rumoured to be thick red people who can not bend or smile , but I have learned never to trust rumours and I find you graceful . ' <p> ' My name is Gillian Perholt , ' said Dr Perholt . ' I am an independent woman , a scholar , I study tale-telling and narratology . ' ( She thought he could learn this useful word ; his green eyes glittered . ) ' I am in Turkey for a conference , and return to my island in a week 's time . I do not think my history will interest you , much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your power , and it is always wise to understand the history of those who hold power over you . I have lived much of my life in harems , and in harems the study of apparently uneventful personal histories is a matter of extreme personal importance . The only truly independent woman I have known was the Queen of Sheba , my half-cousin , but I see that things have changed since her day . What does an independent woman wish for , Djil-yan Peri-han ? ' <p> ' Not much , ' said Gillian , ' that I have n't got . I need to think . I need to be intelligent . Tell me the story of your three incarcerations . If that would not bore you . ' <p> She was later to wonder how she could be so matter-of-fact about the presence of the gracefully lounging Oriental daimon in a hotel room . At the time , she unquestioningly accepted his reality and his remarks as she would have done if she had met him in a dream  --  that is to say , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which she was not everyday , was not the reality in which Dr Johnson refuted Bishop Berkeley 's solipsism with a robust kick at a trundling stone . She was accustomed also to say in lectures , that it was possible that the human need to tell tales about things that were unreal originated in dreams , and that memory had certain things also in common with dreams ; it re-arranged , it made clear , simple narratives , certainly it invented as well as recalling . Hobbes , she told her students , had described imagination as decayed memory . She had at no point the idea that she might ' wake up ' from the presence of the djinn and find him gone as though he had never been ; but she did feel she might move suddenly  --  of he might  --  into some world where they no longer shared a mutual existence . But he persisted , his finger-nails and toe-nails solid and glistening , his flesh with its slightly simmering quality , his huge considering eyes , his cloak of wings , his scent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ djinns have pheromones , a question she was not ready to put to him . She suggested ordering a meal from room service , and together they chose charred vegetable salad , smoked turkey , melons and passion fruit sorbet ; the djinn made himself scarce whilst this repast was wheeled in , and added to it , upon his reappearance , a bowl of fresh figs and pomegranates and some intensely rose-perfumed loukoum . Gillian said that she need not have ordered anything if he could do that , and he said that she did not allow for the effects of curiosity on one who had been cramped in a bottle since 1850 ( your reckoning , he said in French )  --  he desired greatly to see the people and way of life of this late time . <p> ' Your slaves , ' he said , ' are healthy and smiling . That is good . ' <p> ' There are no slaves , we no longer have slaves  --  at least not in the West and not in Turkey  --  we are all free , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uttered . <p> ' No slaves , ' said the djinn thoughtfully . ' No sultans , maybe , either ? ' <p> ' No sultans , A republic . Here . In my country we have a Queen . She has no power . She is  --  a representative figure . ' <p> ' The Queen of Sheba had power , ' said the djinn , folding his brow in thought , and adding dates , sherbet , quails , marrons glaces and two slices of tarte aux pommes to the feast spread before them . ' She would say to me , as her spies brought her news of his triumphal progress across the desert , the great Suleiman , blessed be his memory , she would say , ' How can I , a great Queen , submit to the prison house of marriage , to the invisible chains which bind me to the bed of a man ? ' I advised her against it . I told her her wisdom was hers and she was free as an eagle floating on the waves of the air and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even eye . I told her her body was rich and lovely but her mind was richer and lovelier and more durable  --  for although she was partly of our kind , she was a mortal being , like you  --  djinns and mortals can not produce an immortal scion , you know , as donkeys and horses can only produce a seedless mule . And she said she knew I was in the fight : she sat amongst the cushions in her inner room , where no one came , and twisted her dark hair in her hand , and knit her brow in thought , and I looked at the great globes of her breasts and the narrowness of her waist and her huge soft fundament like two great heaps of silky sand , and was sick with desire for her , though I said nothing of that , for she liked to play with me a little , she had known me since she was born , I had come visibly in and out of her sleeping-chamb <p>          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
