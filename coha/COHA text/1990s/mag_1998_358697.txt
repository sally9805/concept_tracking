Even in an era where horrific violence seems an everyday occurrence , last year 's story of GIRL X , the nine-year-old who was found raped , beaten and poisoned in a stairwell of Chicago 's notorious Cabrini-Green housing project , seemed especially affecting . About the only bright note was the speed at which contributions , many as little as $5 or $10 , poured in to help . Now one of the principal fund raisers , BEVERLY REED , an unemployed single mother of five , finds herself the target of the Illinois attorney general 's office over her handling of $310,000 she collected on the girl 's behalf . According to depositions taken in connection with the investigation , Reed spent more than $50,000 for personal use , including rent , utility bills , a computer , babysitters for her children and payments to friends and family . Authorities contend that only about $1,400 has gone to Girl X or her family .
