Although the writer does not have statistical support for the changes he has viewed in elementary education over the course of the past two decades , he is convinced - based on observations , readings , and discussions - that the changes have occurred . Further , he is convinced that each change dealt with in this paper represents a step backward in the quest of all educators to make public elementary schooling as strong and productive as possible . <p> It is not the purpose of this paper to analyze the underlying philosophical , social , political or whatever reasons that the changes have occurred . Nor is it the purpose to identify the ways in which elementary education has made significant strides forward during the past two or so decades . Indeed , each of these is a noble purpose , but they must be dealt with at another time . Again , the purpose here is merely to state and to elaborate on the fact that for as many steps forward as there may well have been in elementary education , there also have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward in elementary education is the replacement of diagnostic discipline with behavior modification approaches . Behavior modification does work ! Few teachers who have tried the approach would deny that fact . The procedure is comparatively easy : ( 1 ) identify the undesired behavior , ( 2 ) identify the desired behavior ; ( 3 ) reward the desired behavior ; and ( 4 ) ignore , react to , or punish the undesired behavior . Consistency and fairness are watchwords in behavior modification , and these , too , are key elements in any good discipline plan . What is the problem , then ? <p> The problem is that behavior modification never addresses the causes of of students ' behavior . It makes little difference to behavior modifiers why students are misbehaving  --  just as long as they can be conditioned to behave appropriately . In the first place , the proponents of behavior modification argue that teachers frequently do not have the professional training or experience to detect the underlying causes of behavior and , in the second place , even if the causes are detected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , advocates of the diagnostic approach to discipline do not concur with either argument . First , they say , teachers always have and will continue to determine the causes of some behavior problems . Making such determinations in many cases is vital . It makes a great deal of difference , for example , to learn that Johnny is clinically hyperactive , or high on drugs , or simply seeking attention . Secondly , teachers in fact can do something about many of the causes once they have been determined . Certainly , diagnostic discipline takes more time , more energy , and more emotional involvement on the part of teachers , but merely to condition children through behavior modification techniques to behave well in the classroom is not good enough . For as long as the causes of behavior are left untreated , the symptoms are bound to recur . Decoding Skills <p> A second step backward in elementary education during the course of the past twenty years is the increased emphasis in reading instruction on decoding skills , particularly those of phonics and structural analysis . one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to teach so many of these skills to children at younger and younger ages that they have little time to do anything else in reading . Knowingly or not , purposely or not , reading for inferential and critical comprehension and reading for appreciation have assumed roles of secondary and tertiary importance . <p> No one , of course , denies the importance of decoding skills , but it is a sad commentary to observe students being placed in reading groups on the basis of their ability to identify which word has a different ending sound ( cats , dogs , or chickens ) or which word has a different beginning sound ( think , them , or those ) rather than on their ability to read each word with understanding in a meaningful passage . Unfortunately , that is exactly what is happening . Eventually , society in general will have to pay the price for this folly by having to deal with numerous citizens who either will be a literate ( they can but wo n't read ) or will be unable to comprehend beyond the literal level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education during the past two decades is the narrowing of the concept of individualized instruction . When individualized instruction is mentioned today , one immediately thinks of four phenomena ( 1 ) to devise end administer diagnostic pre-tests to determine what learners do and do not know ; ( 2 ) let learners proceed at their own pace , quickly or slowly ; ( 3 ) let learners study using their own preferred study habits or-stated in another way-have teachers provide fore variety of student learning , either visual , auditory , or tactile ; and provide remedial instruction to learners who need it before they attempt to learn new sets of materials . <p> Individualized instruction twenty years ago meant the preceding four factors and three more : ( 1 ) to let learners help set the goals of instruction , ( 2 ) to provide learners with a variety of topics that they could choose to study , and ( 3 ) to encourage learners to select and pursue related topics of learning on their own . This is not to say that none of these three is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being given less choice in terms of what to study than they were two or three decades ago . With the continuing knowledge explosion , and the realization by most that people need to be diverse in terms of what they study and learn , the movement away from student choice of learning goals and objectives seems particularly indefensible . Mastery Learning <p> A fourth step backward is the movement away from " relative " mastery learning to " absolute " mastery learning . Absolute mastery learning means that everyone m a classroom or a given grade level must perform satisfactorily on a uniform set of criteria . " All learners will be able to differentiate between the sh and ch digraph sounds at the beginning of words with 90% accuracy " would be just one example out of literally thousands that are possible . The fact is , however , that a certain number of these criteria or objectives are established and are required for everyone . <p> The problem with absolute mastery objectives is that they violate or fail to take into account the most fundamental of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can learn things less bright people can not learn , and can learn most other things at a far faster pace . one implication of this principle of learning is that there are some children who will never learn what others can learn even if given extraordinary lengths of time . What to do with these former children is a problem that absolute learning proponents have not dealt with successfully . Another implication of this principle of learning is that some children can progress through a uniform set of learning objectives so rapidly , if given a chance , that they literally end up with " nothing to do . " Again , absolute learning theorists have not dealt with this problem successfully . <p> The only solution to these problems is to do whet teachers were attempting to do twenty years ago , namely , to implement the practice of relative mastery learning . ( It may not have been called relative mastery learning at the time , but that 's what it was . ) Relative mastery learning simply means that , instead of one uniform set of learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of objectives that apply to him or her alone . Mastering these relative objectives , then , becomes the key . on the one hand , slow children are not challenged beyond their capacity , and on the other hand , bright children are expected to work and to live up to their potential . Relative mastery learning , in other words , is individualized instruction at its best . No , teachers were not perfect at implementing relative mastery learning twenty years ago , but they were much further along that road than they are today . The philosophical and instructional emphases have shifted significantly . Grouping <p> A fifth step backward in elementary education in the past twenty years is the movement away from self-contained , heterogeneously grouped classes to departmentalized , homogeneously grouped classes . There are two principal drawbacks is such a movement . First , in departmentalized settings young children are not able to see the inrelatedness of subject matter nearly so well as they can in self-contained situations . The real problems in the lives of youngsters , as well as of adults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together concepts and information from a variety of disciplines . Perhaps adolescents and adults can automatically call forth multi-discipline approaches to their problems , but elementary-age children can not . These children need the skillful guidance of teachers who have the organizational flexibility whenever necessary to integrate reading , language arts , math , science , and social studies for the purpose of problem solving . Such integration can only take place in self-contained classrooms . <p> A second drawback in this movement is that homogeneously grouped classes are basically segregated classes . Children need to learn to live with other children , and not just with others who are fundamentally clones of themselves . They need to learn to live together with children who are different-in race , color , creed , and abilities . This happens best in heterogeneous classrooms . Indeed , it is one of the fundamental reasons public schools exist . Teaching Basics <p> A sixth and final step backward in elementary education is the movement away f rom educating whole children to a concern f or educating their " intellect . " Keen observation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with education for intellectual development . The notion that schools need to be just as concerned for nurturing the physical , social , emotional , and aesthetic lives of youngsters is simply considered antiquated . According to the majority of today 's theorists , the latter is a philosophy of schooling whose time has come and gone ; it is something that " somebody else " is going to have to attend to . Just getting on with the basics is more than enough for schools to do . Meanwhile , of course , the proponents of whole-child education become irate at such myopic views of the purposes of schooling . one thing is certain , however ; today such proponents are decisively in the minority . Conclusion <p> At a time in our history when education for quality has never before been the focus of so much attention , it is disturbing to note that there are some fundamental flaws in the manner in which we educators are attempting to achieve that quality . It is disturbing to note that , in some respects at least , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are : Do we have the wisdom to see the mistakes of our current ways ? And do we have the courage to admit those mistakes in a time of high national visibility ? Neither is easily answered . <p> Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to J.
