Trying to govern an interstellar empire is a bit like governing a transoceanic empire in the days of sailwith at least one important difference ! <p> Arnold Amlingmeyer wanted a bridge to stride across , a control room to dominate with his sinister presence . But he did n't have one . The Rectifier was far too cramped a ship for such a luxury , and everything was automated anyway . So he had to content himself with striding down the narrow hallways and dominating the sleepchambers . It worked well enough . He just needed the practice . Eventually , after almost an hour of striding and dominating , he felt powerful enough to begin waking up his men . Sgt. Winslow " Bull " Schott came first . Schott was the professional , the one who would handle the military side of the operation . But he would be taking his orders from Arnold . Arnold and Schott had n't met yetthe Marines had boarded and gone into hibernation almost a week before Arnold was picked to command the mission-so Arnold thought it was important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the soldier 's sleeptube while the central computer brought him out of hibernation . He agonized over his opening line . " Arise , my pawn , " seemed overblown . But " Get up and get ready to kick some mother-lovin " ass ! " did n't have the right kind of grave dignity . The shieldglass over Schott slid away . The soldier 's eyelids were fluttering . Arnold leaned down over him . " Good morning , Sgt. Schott , " Arnold intoned menacingly . " It 's time to wake up and crush a rebellion . " Schott groaned . " Wha ' ? " " It 's time to wake up and crush a rebellion ! " The sergeant 's eyes opened . He stared up at Arnold , disoriented . " What did you say ? " he mumbled , his voice slurred by years of sleep . Arnold suppressed the urge to sigh . " Sgt. Schott , I am Ulysses S. Rook . I am in command of this mission . It 's time to get your men ready . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schott rubbed his eyes groggily . " Sigma what ? I thought we were going to New Venture . " Arnold clinched his fists . " Yes , that 's right , Sergeant . They 're the same thing . " He whirled around and began using his newly perfected stride . " Get the troops ready . I 'm contacting the rebels tomorrow . " " Excuse me ? " Arnold kept striding . Arnold spent most of the next day in his cramped chamber , hiding-although he preferred to think of it as " lurking . " He was still trying to cultivate an air of refined menace , but he was n't sure if it was working . The soldiers did n't seem to fear him yet . He needed more practice . Schott came to him every few hours with updates . " The T-II Ils are locked down , " was one report . Arnold did n't know if this was good or bad , so he just nodded curtly . " The A.S.C. triple-naughts are primed and ready for action , " was the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled ominously . " Ex-cel lent , " he hissed . " The scheiss gun has been willowed and boundered , " Schott told him an hour later . " And the putz tubes are ready for planking . " The soldier stared at Arnold . He seemed to expect some specific response this time . " By all means , plank away , Sgt. Schott . We ca n't have unplanked tubes , can we ? " Schott smiled at that . " No , sir . " He saluted ostentatiously , turned crisply on his heel , and left . The sergeant treated him with cool deference , which was satisfying . But Arnold had been hoping to inspire craven cowering in his underlings . Schott did n't seem like the kind of man who did much cowering , though . He was easily six and a half feet tall , with steel-gray hair and hard eyes . Arnold had asked Schott to refer to him as " Commander Rook " - he 'd picked out the name for its diabolical flair-but the soldier got around the order by simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold . Trying to impress Bull Schott and the troops had just been a warm-up , though . The people Arnold really needed to make an impression on were the rebels-the colonists of New Venture . Thirty-four years ago , Omnicorp had received the first empty transport ship from its colony eighteen lightyears away . The only cargo had been a single message disk . " As of this moment , the citizens of New Venture declare the Colonial Licensing Charter of 2116 to be null and void . We proclaim ourselves free from indenture to Omnicorp and all contractual obligations to same , " said the young woman on the disk , who identified herself as " President Yeo . " " We 're sorry it came to this . But obviously , our relationship had become pretty one-sided . We gave , you took . It 's best if it ends this way . " The woman smiled sweetly . " We can still be friends , ca n't we ? Good-bye . " Still be friends ? When New Venture owed Omnicorp 755 tons of iron , 467 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of gold , 287 tons of silver , 212 tons of cobalt , 23 tons of deuterium , 14 tons of uranium , 13 tons of plutonium , 2 tons of diamonds and other precious stones , 987 samples of native flora and 546 samples of native fauna ? Not to mention assorted penalties and fees now that was decades late . Arnold could figure it all up in his head . He 'd come up through the Accounting and Finance division , after all . Obviously , Omnicorp had to do something . If it did n't act decisively , its days as a colonial powerhouse were over . Someone would have to go to New Venture to restore order . A company man . The ultimate company man . Arnold still was n't really sure why they 'd picked him . Maybe it was because he was one of the few candidates who really wanted to go . It did n't bother him that he would never see Earth again . He was n't leaving much behind . His sister , his mother , and his fish might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a desolate , sparsely populated rock , but what he would have there would be endlessly more satisfying than anything he had back home : power . He 'd been picked out of obscurity for the assignment : He was n't a corporate star , not even a " go-getter " in most colleague 's eyes . But somehow Omnicorp 's decision had n't surprised him . He believed in destiny . He had always known that one day he would be a mighty figure of fear , that people would tremble before him . It had only been a matter of time before the Universe revealed the circumstances . And now fate had deposited him on his own starship ( actually a hastily refitted cargo barge once known as the Omnicorp New Jersey ) complete with a platoon of fierce Marines ( mostly debtors , petty criminals , and other conscripts , but they would soon prove themselves in battle ) , two powerful nuclear warheads ( a couple of army-surplus Pocket Nukes ) , and the prerogative to use them as he saw fit . Arnold clasped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . It sounded good , so he said it again . Arnold had options . He could use one of the Pocket Nukes to announce his arrival . He could send down the Marines . Or he could hold off on the muscle until he 'd gauged the rebels " attitudes . It was an easy choice . Pocket Nukes were expensive and-now that he was so far away from Earth-hard to come by . And though Bull Schott seemed capable enough , his troops were untested . Negotiating first would give Arnold a chance to put his personal powers to the test . Could he intimidate the colonists into abject capitulation ? Would they recognize and fear his authority , his ruthlessness ? He had to find out . He draped an Omnicorp flag on the back wall of his chamber and brought in Schott and two Marines to stand before it . Then he squeezed in front of them-it was a tight fit-straightened his jet-black tunic , cleared his throat and switched on the communi-unit . " People of New Venture , the time of reckoning is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starship Rectifier . I have been sent by Omnicorp to restore the rule of law and collect payment past due . I have at my disposal both a nuclear arsenal and a full battalion of Earth 's finest fighting forces . I am more than willing to employ these resources to devastating effect . You are powerless to stop me . If your leaders do not signal to me their complete and utter surrender within three hours , I will destroy Venture City and send down my troops to take control of the planet . Your rebellion is at an end . Do not be so foolish as to test my resolve . " He switched the communi-unit off and turned to Schott . " What do you think , Sgt. Schott ? Will they give in . . . or will we have to crush them beneath our bootheels ? " " Sir , I think- " He looked over Arnold 's shoulder . " I think you have a message , " he said . He looked thankful for the interruption . " Incoming " flashed across the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Arnold said . A dark-skinned woman appeared on the screen . " I am Helen Bozyk , president of New Venture . There 's no need for violence . We surrender . " Arnold let a prim smile crease his lips . " Good . You have chosen wisely . But as of this moment , you are no longer president of anything . I am now the military governor of New Venture . I will come to Venture City immediately to begin organizing the next shipment to Omnicorp . See that there is no resistance . If a single shot is fired against us , the full nuclear capabilities of this vessel will be unleashed on your population . Is that clear ? " Bozyk nodded . " Yes . I understand . " Arnold turned the communi-unit off again . " That was quick , " Schott said . " They 're not fools , Sergeant . They could see I 'm not to be trifled with . " Schott considered his reply for a moment . " Should we prepare the shuttle ? With an escort ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to inspect my new capital as soon as possible . " Arnold dismissed the soldiers and slid open his closet . He 'd had a duraleather field uniform custom-made back on Earth . It had cost him a fortune , but what difference did it make how much money was left fn a bank account eighteen light-years away ? The people of New Venture were about to meet their new ruler . They deserved a spectacle . Arnold was sweating under the hot light of Sigma Draconis . His field uniform looked impressive-he 'd spent a full hour strapping on his gun belt , adjusting his epaulets , puffing out his breeches , pinning on his medals , tilting his busby just so . But the fabric did n't breathe . It was stifling . He was almost afraid he would faint . He struggled to conceal his discomfort . There were the throngs to think about . The cheering throngs . Thousands of Venturians lined the streets , greeting Arnold and his motorcade with hurrahs and confetti . Some of them even waved little flags , though Arnold could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were . Occasionally , a girl would dart into the street to kiss one of Arnold 's Marines . An old woman tossed him a bouquet of flowers . They were n't just conquerors . They were liberators ! Although liberators from what , Arnold was n't sure . Most likely Bozyk was a tyrant , her cronies radical anti-corporationists . The people were thrilled to be returning to the womb of civilized mercantilism . Arnold waved to the multitudes-a reserved wave , the bent-elbow handflutter of pontiffs and royalty . " Should n't you sit down , sir ? " Schott growled . The grizzled old vet 's eyes scanned the crowd anxiously . " You make a good target standing up like that . " Arnold'kept his eyes on the crowd , too . " I do n't think we have anything to worry about , " he said , waving . " Look at those faces ! We 're heroes , Sgt. Schott . No one will try to harm us . " He gave a lump in his tunic a quick pat . " But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got the Pocket Nukes to back us up . One push of a button , and the Rectifier will unleash fiery death from above . " Schott simply grunted in reply . Arnold let the lapse in protocol slip by . A few minutes later the motorcade reached the capitol building . A somber delegation of Venturians was waiting on the steps in front . Bozyk was among them . She stepped forward and bowed solemnly . " Commander Rook , welcome to Venture City . " Arnold 's driver hopped out and opened the back door of the touring car . Arnold stepped down from the vehicle with regal confidence . " Thank you , Citizen Bozyk . Your cooperation so far has stayed your execution . Continue to cooperate , and it may be delayed indefinitely . " Bozyk lifted her head . Her eyes were calm . " I understand , Commander . " " Good . Now please show me to your office-or I should say my office . I have much to do and I wish to get started immediately . " Bozyk bowed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Arnold marched crisply up the steps after Bozyk . Schott came , too , waving a handful of Marines to follow . More Venturians were waiting in the lobby as Arnold and his party entered . They all bowed silently . Bozyk led them to an ornately decorated elevator bank . " This leads directly to your office , Commander Rook , " she said . Emblazoned on the elevator doors was a huge " R " in a golden crest . It looked remarkably like the insignia on his own uniform . Arnold chuckled dryly . " Ironic . What did the " R " on these doors originally stand for ? " " The " R " is for " Rook , " Commander , " Bozyk replied . Arnold raised an eyebrow at Schott . The sergeant did n't seem amused . " Your people do quick work , Citizen Bozyk . " Bozyk smiled . " Thank you , CommandeL " The doors opened , and Bozyk motioned for Arnold to enter . " After you , Citizen . " Bozyk stepped into the elevator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beams or bullets or metal rods had torn Bozyk to pieces , he followed . Schott stepped in after posting more guards in the lobby . The doors closed and the elevator began to hum . " I think you 'll like your office , Commander , " Bozyk said . " We did our best to please you . " The doors slid apart , revealing a room straight out of Arnold 's dreams . The desk was vast , easily the length of a luxury groundcar . The gold-crested " R " shone from its black durawood . On each side of the desk was a globe-one of Earth , one of New Venture . Behind it was a long picture window looking out over the city . On the opposite wall was a larger-than-life portrait of Arnold himself . He stood on a rocky precipice , hands on his hips , his face bathed in the glow of Sigma Draconis . Bozyk stepped up to the picture . " We can redo the painting if you wish . We were n't sure which of your uniforms you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform-which he 'd put on for the first time just hours before . Arnold walked over to the massive desk and leaned against its smooth , cold surface . Once again , he was afraid he might faint . " No , it 's fine , " he said , his voice a whisper . " How did you finish all this so quickly ? " " We did n't , Mr. Amlingmeyer . We 've been preparing for you for years . n Arnold straightened up and turned to face Bozyk . " I am Ulysses S. Rook , commander of the starship Rectifier ! " Bozyk nodded . " Yes , you are now . But back on Earth you were Arnold Amlingmeyer , certified public accountant of Queens , New York . " A harsh laugh boomed out , bouncing off the walls of the cavernous office . It was Schott . " I knew it ! " he said . " I knew it ! " " That will be all , Sergeant ! " Arnold snapped . Schott stopped laughing , but the look of bemused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bozyk , trying to burn into her with a malevolent gaze . " Where did you get your information ? Anti-corporationist spies ? " " Spies , yes . The corporate kind , " Bozyk replied , unruffled . " Omnicorp 's rivals were more than happy to help us . Their radio reports reached us a lot faster than your ship could . We 've had your psychological profile for almost twelve years . We have files on all your men . " She favored Schott with a smile . " Even you , Bull . " " None of that changes anything , " Arnold replied , straining to sound icy cool . " My troops have occupied the capital , and I am taking control of New Venture . " " Your troops are in the capital , but I 'm not so sure they 're occupying it anymore . " What do you mean ? " Bozyk stepped over to the picture window . She gestured at a large estate visible below . In the center of a long , immaculate lawn stood a massive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun above the front steps . Dozens of smaller yet equally pristine houses ringed the estate . " By now , most of your " Marines " on New Venture have been told about their new homes . " Bozyk pointed to one particularly ornate house surrounded by a small grove of drooping trees . " That one 's yours , Bull , if you want it . Does it look familiar ? We modeled it after the commandant 's quarters at Fort Eisner . You always admired that house , did n't you ? " Schott rubbed his chin . " It looks a hell of a lot nicer than a barracks , that 's for sure . " Arnold could see figures-many of them clad in olive drab-moving up and down the streets between the homes . " I want a status report , Sgt. Schott . " Schott turned around slowly . From the look on his face , Arnold could n't tell if he was going to speak or spit . " O.K. , sir , " Schott said . He flicked on his helmet mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Damas , are you there ? Goldberg , check in . Goldberg ? " He shook his head . " Sorry , sir . " " Now you understand your hero 's welcome , " Bozyk said to Arnold . " You are our savior-from Omnicorp . All you have to do is join us and become a revered citizen of New Venture . " Schott waggled a thumb over his shoulder . " You built all that for us ? " Bozyk nodded . " Yes . It was expensive , but cheaper than our freedom . . or who knows how many lives . " Schott grunted . Arnold knew he 'd lost him . He was losing all his men , all his power . But he still had his Pocket Nukes-and his nerves of steel . He worked up a sneer . " It 's a trap , Sgt. Schott . You 're a fool if you ca n't see that , " Arnold said . He slid his compad out of his field jacket . " Fortunately , I do n't need the help of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my finger tips is all the help I need . " Bozyk 's cool facade finally cracked . " Please , no ! " Schott swung his rifle off his shoulder-and pointed it at Arnold . " Do n't do it , Anlingmeyer . " Arnold let his thumb caress the firing key . " The name is Rook . And I do n't take orders from mutinous sergeants . " Bozyk took a wobbly step towards Arnold . " Please , you have to believe me . It 's not a trap , " she said , her voice trembling . " Perhaps you could convince me of that . But it really does n't matter if it 's a trap or not , " Arnold replied . " You must submit to my authority . . . or watch half your population vaporized . " " You would n't ! " Schott spat . Arnold returned the soldier 's scornful gaze . He held it for a long moment until . . . There ! He saw it ! Fear . " Push that button and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His words came out too loud and fast and shrill to hide his fright . " I mean it ! I 'll kill you ! " Arnold looked back at Bozyk . She had dropped to her knees . She was pleading with him . " I beg you , have mercy , " she said . " Have mercy on us , Commander Rook . " Arnold drank in the raw dread on her face , savoring it . This was the moment he 'd always dreamed of . This was his destiny ! He was satisfied . New Venture was always fond of its " dictator . " The citizens bowed to him as he paraded down the streets of the capital . He got the best seat in any restaurant or tavern he entered , and the food and drink did n't stop coming until he was completely satisfied . Merchants competed for the honor of supplying him with free goods and services . Most fierce of all was the competition over his clothes . Every tailor and would-be designer on the planet wanted to claim credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The government treated him with deference , too . He opened every session of parliament ( after a grand entrance and a short speech ) with the whack of a ceremonial gavel . And he received private briefings from the presidents-first Bozyk , then Mendelsohn , then Schott . " Excellent , " he would say at some bit of news . Or " You have done well . " Or " I am pleased . " Or he would just nod and look thoughtful . Sometimes he would offer advice , but as the years went by only the complex haggling over the state budget really interested him . Occasionally his ideas were even good . Not every Venturian treated him with respect , of course . Some could n't conceal their derisive grins . They would snicker or make sarcastic comments in his presence . But his grave , dignified mien never faltered . He would just go a little glassy-eyed , as if he no longer saw the people around him but was instead looking at something that had happened long ago , something infinitely more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform tunic or rub his thumb slowly over his forefinger , as if stroking some invisible key . Then he would smile his prim little smile and return to the palace .
