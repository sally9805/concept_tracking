<p> Responding to criticism from consumer groups , TRW Inc. , the nation 's largest credit bureau , decided that it would provide upon request a free copy of one 's credit report . <p> The announcement came soon after TRW admitted , in the summer of 1991 , to having made a mistake with records from Norwich , Vermont . All 1,400 taxpayers were branded when a part-time clerk went to Norwich to collect the names of delinquent taxpayers . She mistakenly wrote down the names of everyone who paid their taxes . <p> TRW 's new policy puts considerable pressure on its two rivals , Equifax Inc. and Trans Union Credit Information Co. , to follow suit . Equifax responded by saying that it expects to cut significantly the price to obtain a credit report . Trans Union , not as quick to give in , says that providing free reports is " an extremely expensive solution " that will ultimately make it harder to obtain credit and more expensive to buy goods on credit . <p> Critics claim TRW 's efforts are not satisfactory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last twenty years that existing laws regulating credit bureaus are obsolete and need revision . More than 30 resolutions concerning credit bureaus are currently being considered in Congress . The bills aim to place more specific and tighter requirements on credit bureaus than current law to control how errors are handled and information is used in the estimated 400 million credit reports issued on Americans each year . <p> Legislators refer to hundreds of stories from consumers claiming to have lost their jobs or been denied credit because of credit bureau mistakes . When Representative Esteban Torres ( D-Calif ) introduced a bill , he said the current law allows the private lives of consumers to be " an open book . Sensitive personal and financial data are bought and sold without regard to privacy ; consumer reports are riddled with errors , resulting in denial of credit , insurance , and employment . " <p> Torres cites studies by Consumers Union and U.S. Public Interest Research Group ( U.S. PIRG ) that " reveal a system characterized by inefficiency , inaccuracy , and dangerous disregard for the consumer 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of its reports , while requiring more than six months to remove those errors . " <p> But the bleak picture painted by congressional activists does not hold up under scrutiny . Data from the industry and independent observers show many concerns about errors in credit reports are overblown or misguided . Further , the industry 's process to solve problems that inevitably turn up in the complex system of reporting consumers ' financial information appears much more comprehensive than typical portrayals of the situation . <p> This is not to say that you should n't be concerned about errors , which occur with enough frequency to warrant vigilance , but that your best protection is to understand and use the system to insure you get the credit you deserve . To understand what goes on with credit reports , also known as consumer reports , it is important to step back and consider the industry as a whole and how it helps consumers . How Credit Works <p> Credit enables millions of consumers to buy millions of dollars worth of goods every day . Yet the value of credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more convenient than carrying large sums of cash . Credit gives the consumer the ability to arrange a consumption plan suited to his individual earning pattern . He can finance real-estate and consumer durables to smooth out his consumption over his life . Although many consumers do themselves a disservice by overusing credit , the fact that millions of consumers use credit every day is strong evidence that it is a useful tool . <p> Consumers can get credit precisely because credit grantors can identify which consumers are likely to pay their bills . Without credit bureaus , businesses would have a tough time accumulating the payment histories of individual consumers and would not give credit , except in special circumstances . Punishing a consumer who defaults would be an expensive and time-consuming process . Historically , when credit reporting has been absent , so has consumer credit . With credit reporting in place , consumers have an extra incentive to pay their bills . They are eager to keep their credit record clean , for otherwise they may lose the benefits of credit . <p> The ability of creditors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If credit grantors did not have the knowledge gathered by credit reporting agencies , then creditors would be forced to make up for the losses caused by defaulters . Prices would have to increase , harming all consumers . Faithful bill-paying consumers would not be rewarded for their good behavior . <p> " The mission of the consumer reporting industry is to serve as an objective third-party provider of information to the companies and consumers involved in credit transactions , " notes Walter R. Kurth , President of Associated Credit Bureaus , the industry trade group . <p> Almost one billion credit cards are in use in the United States and millions of Americans finance homes by a mortgage . Credit is made available to anyone in the United States who can show that he or she has the ability to pay loans as agreed . <p> " American citizens ' access to housing , cars , televisions , clothing , household appliances , travel , education , and medicine is understandably the envy of the world , " notes Kurth . <p> Oscar Marquis , Vice President of Trans Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer credit information helps Americans purchase more than 15,000 homes , 40,000 autos , and 500,000 major appliances every day . Consumers have credit cards approved instantly . They can purchase cars and drive them home on the same day because the system of consumer reporting works and works successfully . " <p> Contrary to the impression given by industry critics , there is a great deal of simple information that credit bureaus do n't know about individual consumers . For example , they do n't know : Where one went to school and what degrees one has . An individual 's driving record . Whether one has pets . Who one 's relatives are , except sometimes the spouse . One 's religious , political , or cultural views . <p> In other words , although the credit bureau knows that a consumer has a mortgage and a credit card , it does not know the simplest facts about a consumer 's life , facts that a casual acquaintance would know . <p> Credit bureaus are discreet and impersonal when gathering and storing information precisely because it is in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standardized , automated information , and utilize only the most relevant information and transmit it to only the most relevant parties . <p> Most of the ( approximately 1,000 ) automated credit bureaus operate on one of the three on-line data processing systems-Trans Union Credit Information Co. , TRW Inc. , and Equifax Inc . But nearly 500 of these automated credit reporting agencies are owned either by a private independent party or a non-profit merchant association that purchases from one of the three giants . <p> The third parties that receive reports are usually credit grantors ( banks and retail businesses ) , but employers , landlords , and insurance companies also have an interest in the reports . Businesses that subscribe to a credit bureau pay a monthly fee and then pay a unit price for the reports . Credit grantors that choose not to subscribe have to pay a great deal more and go through more trouble to get them . For example , they must work through authorized " resellers , " or brokers , of credit information . <p> Credit bureaus provide reports of a consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open credit lines ( such as a MasterCard ) , of outstanding credit balances ( such as how much is owed on a car ) , and a history of payments . Credit reports detail delinquent payments and note any liens against a consumer . The reports contain the individual 's address and Social Security number . This information is gathered from creditors , who supply their records either directly to the three giants or indirectly through local bureaus . Trans Union , TRW , and Equifax enhance their database by obtaining information from county , state , and federal repositories relating to bankruptcies , court judgements , and liens . <p> TRW publicizes the fact that it maintains credit information on more than 133 million consumers , and that more than 8,000 businesses regularly contribute their accounts-receivable data to TRW . Trans Union says it maintains 170 million credit files , covering about 80% of all U.S. households . The three agencies contain much overlapping information . <p> The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires each agency to keep accurate records and investigate consumer complaints about information on reports . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumer is entitled to file a brief statement setting forth his version of the story . If a consumer is denied credit based on information in an agency 's report , the consumer is entitled to receive a free copy of the report . ( See box , page 12 . ) <p> It 's important to realize that answering consumer complaints is an inherent part of the credit reporting industry . The industry follows standard practices based on both legal necessity and common sense . It is in the best interests of the industry to maintain accurate records and be responsive to consumer complaints , not only for consumers , but for the credit grantors , who rely on the credit reports for accurate assessment of how well people will pay back their loans ; inaccurate information means either bad loans or missed opportunities . ( Compared with consumer groups , creditors do little complaining about credit reporting inaccuracies . ) HOW FREQUENT ARE ERRORS ? <p> The frequency of errors committed by credit bureaus is the main focus of the critics ' attacks . Credit bureaus are held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that many forces are involved in the credit reporting process . <p> The failure of the U.S. Postal Service to forward mail promptly and properly often leads to problems . When a bill is not forwarded the inevitable result is that the consumer will be reported as delinquent . The credit bureau is not involved in any way ; it only records the information as it is received . <p> But credit grantors are a bigger part of the credit reporting process . Any errors in the information sent by creditors unavoidably becomes a part of the credit bureau records , because the credit bureau merely records the information as it is received . <p> Some lack of uniformity in reporting also leads to errors , according to Kurth . Credit grantors , for example , often give the customers some leeway when making payments . If a customer has shown a good payment record the credit granter often extends the amount of time allowed for the consumer to pay . In other words a consumer may be late , but not delinquent , but the information supplied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital role in maintaining accurate reports , and consumers can make mistakes as well . Bills can be misplaced , personal checks may not be recorded and memory fails , out-going mail can fail to find its way to the mailbox . If a consumer fails to pay the amount owed ( purposely or otherwise ) , a black mark will eventually end up on his report . <p> Errors can also arise from the public records credit bureaus consult . Any misinformation in these records will turn up on credit reports . <p> Because credit bureaus are the most visible and centralized piece in the credit reporting process , they bear the brunt of complaints , even though thousands of other institutions are involved in the process . Although credit bureaus do occasionally err , as exemplified with TRW in the Norwich incident , for the most part they merely record the information as it is received . <p> Another criticism of the credit bureaus has been that they are slow or even refuse to correct mistakes . Consumers must realize that a credit bureau can not change a consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone or that errors that do not affect one 's credit rating might not be serious enough to fix . <p> " What is an inaccuracy in a credit report ? Some argue that any piece of information-no matter how minute-that is not perfectly correct is an inaccuracy , " says Kurth . " But if the lack of precision has no effect on consumer 's ability to get credit , the consumer is not inconvenienced . Inaccuracies that unjustly prevent consumers from obtaining the goods and services they seek are the problem . Typographical errors are not . " <p> When a consumer makes a complaint that a credit report contains false information the credit bureau seeks to reverify its information with the credit granter . According to Associated Credit Bureaus , reverification usually takes place within two weeks . The massive amount of communications involved from the credit bureau to the credit granter , back to the credit bureau and then the consumer , make any requirement of less than two weeks unfeasible . Additionally , although not required by law , it is industry practice to delete derogatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next two weeks why it has n't been deleted . Should a credit granter reverify a delinquency , the consumer can make a statement to say why he thinks the credit granter is at fault , and the statement is included in the report . <p> These challenges take time . The dispute should center on the relationship between the credit granter and the consumer . The credit granter , in turn , has an obligation to give corrected information to the credit bureau . Peer pressure and monitoring by credit bureaus induce businesses to maintain accurate and updated credit repositories . <p> Most media coverage about credit report errors suggest nearly half of the reports contain errors . The source for many such claims is Consumers Union ( CU ) , which conducted a survey of 161 credit reports from the three credit-reporting giants and determined that " the credit reports reviewed were riddled with errors . " In the Executive Summary of its report , CU noted that " 48 percent of all the 161 reports reviewed contained inaccurate information . Many reports contained more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports reviewed contained a ' major ' inaccuracy-i.e. , one that could adversely affect a consumer 's eligibility for credit . " <p> Yet even this consumer group noted that its research " was too small to reach firm conclusions about the accuracy of information in the more than 400 million files maintained by the credit industry . " <p> A recent independent survey provides a more accurate view of errors . Arthur Andersen &; Co. , the internationally recognized accounting and consulting firm , was commissioned by Associated Credit Bureaus in June 1991 to discover how frequently credit record errors cause negative credit decisions . <p> Andersen &; Co. studied a random sample of 15,703 consumers who had been denied credit based on the credit grantor 's scoring system that uses credit report information . The study determined that , from this sample , 1,223 consumers ( or 7.7% ) requested their credit report from the issuing credit bureau . Of this group , only 304 consumers ( or 2% of the study sample ) disputed information on the report . <p> Each dispute was reinvestigated and then all 304 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed ) were returned to the credit grantors that originally denied credit to the consumer . The credit grantors were then asked to reevaluate the credit applications . In only 36 of these cases ( less than 3% of those who reviewed their file ) was the original credit decision reversed to a positive decision . <p> These results are telling , but a definitive and exact measure of the frequency of errors can not be inferred . Consider two cases , the first the worst case scenario , the second a more reasonable scenario . <p> Case 1 : Assume that consumers with errors on their report are no more likely , after being denied credit , to request their credit report or to contest information than consumers without errors . In this case , the 267 reevaluated reports would constitute a random sample of those denied credit , and we would simply divide the 36 decision reversals by 267 to arrive at the estimate that 13% of credit rejections result from errors on credit reports . <p> Yet even this figure , based on assumptions slanted against credit bureaus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others to be excessive . <p> Case 2 : A more responsible estimate from the Andersen information would take into account the fact that someone with an error on his report is more likely to request the report and more likely to contest the information . <p> Suppose , for example , that a person with an error were three times as likely as a person without an error to request a report , and four times more likely to contest information . Then the proportion of credit rejections due to errors on reports would fall to under one percent . The assumptions here seem like reasonable guesses . <p> To sum up : credit bureaus are a service to all consumers who use credit responsibly . The agencies serve as a hub of information , efficiently transmitting information to its members . There are many institutions involved in the credit reporting process , all of which can be at fault for errors that exist in credit reports . Credit bureaus try to resolve discrepancies , but it is necessary for credit grantors and consumers to be recognized as important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a somewhat mysterious entity - one that the average citizen has almost no contact with . The " behind the scenes " aspect makes the industry vulnerable to the alarmist and inflammatory ways of the media and the consumerist groups that are ever ready to give a black eye to big business . Most of the popular discussion of credit reporting is carried on in this manner . To the extent that the critics prevail in influencing laws to hamstring credit bureaus , consumers will benefit very little , but will find credit harder to obtain and available on less attractive terms . <p> <p> <p> ( For related articles , see " Guard Your Social Security Number With Your Life , " CR , December 1991 and " How to Check Your Credit Rating , " CR , September 1989 . ) <p> By Daniel B. Klein and Jason Richner <p> <p> Dr. Klein is an assistant professor of economics and Mr. Richner a senior social science major at the University of California , Irvine . This article is adapted from a paper that will appear in a forthcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair Credit Reporting Act sets forth specific guidelines regarding access to credit reports-available for legitimate credit-granting considerations , review , or collection of an account , employment considerations or insurance underwriting-and to insure consumers have an opportunity to review their credit reports , also known as consumer reports , and correct inaccurate information . <p> Under the law , a consumer reporting agency is required to inform you of the " nature and - content " of any information on your file upon request and proper identification . It must provide you with the names of creditors who have requested information about you in the past six months , or two years if the request was employment-related . <p> If you make the request within 30 days after you 've been denied credit , the report must be provided free of charge ( otherwise , credit agencies can " impose a reasonable charge " for disclosure of this information . ( These charges range from $2 to $20 in the United States . ) Any organization that denies you credit , based on information in your credit report , must notify you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency that supplied the information . <p> Once you 've reviewed your report , the credit agency must " reinvestigate and record the current status of that information " within a reasonable amount of time , unless the agency has reasonable grounds to believe that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant . If the information can not be verified or is found to be inaccurate , the agency must delete or correct the item in your report and furnish notification about the change to anyone you specifically designate who has used the report in the previous six months , or two years for employment-related purposes . <p> If the reinvestigation does not resolve the problem , you can file a brief statement describing your dispute . The agency can limit this to 100 words so long as it assists you in writing a clear summary of your position . The agency then must clearly note particular items in dispute in any subsequent consumer reports and provide a copy of your statement . <p> Finally , the Act establishes the right to bring civil actions against credit bureaus and to collect actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complying with the Act . And it establishes the right to bring criminal proceedings against any person who obtains information under false pretenses . <p> Additional Protections <p> The credit reporting industry has adopted consumer service policies regarding errors that exceed the requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act . You should expect , then , that any agencies you deal with will adhere to the industry standards . Thus , when you check your report make sure the agencies do the following : Provide a printed copy of your full report . ( As noted above , the FCRA only requires the bureau to disclose the " nature and content " of any information in the file , not the full report . ) Provide a free copy of the report for at least 60 days following denial of credit based on data provided by the consumer reporting agency . ( The FCRA requires free disclosure for 30 days . ) Provide a free copy of the report from all three credit reporting systems ( TRW , Trans Union , and Equifax ) when denial of credit was based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only one credit agency issue a report . ) This is helpful in making sure other systems do not also carry inaccurate information . Notify you of the results of a reverification , whether the item has been corrected , dropped , or will remain the same . This saves you the hassle of double checking the agencies ' efforts and allows you the chance to make your case with the original source of the information and the credit agency . <p> You should expect prompt attention to your dispute . According to the ACB , more than 80% of all reinvestigations are completed within 30 days . <p> SOURCES : The Fair Credit Reporting Act , TRW Inc. , Associated Credit Bureaus <p> HOW MUCH DO DIRECT MARKETERS KNOW ? <p> Many concerns about credit information revolve around the fact that credit grantors can gain access to mailing lists compiled by the big three credit reporting agencies . According to the Federal Trade Commission this is legal so long as the credit grantor offers credit to anyone on the list . Nevertheless , this process , known as prescreening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially can snoop through consumers ' private files whether the consumer likes it or not . In fact , the prescreening process precludes such access . The following excerpt from congressional testimony by representatives of VISA and MasterCard sheds some light on this issue  --  Ed . <p> The prescreening process has been used for many years by credit grantors throughout the country to identify potentially creditworthy consumers who may be interested in , and eligible for , credit and other financial products .... <p> After the credit grantor identifies the combination of characteristics that will be required to qualify for the particular loan or credit account to be offered , the credit grantor provides to a credit bureau a list of those characteristics that can be ascertained from the credit bureau 's files . The credit grantor then requests the credit bureau to create a " prescreened list " of consumers who possess the characteristics specified by the credit grantor . <p> A credit bureau will prepare the prescreened list from a list of consumers supplied by the credit grantor or directly from the information maintained in the credit bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list contains only limited information , such as the names and addresses of the consumers who , according to the credit bureau 's files , possess the characteristics identified by the particular credit grantor . It is important to recognize that a prescreened list does not contain the specific credit information typically found in a credit report . Consequently , a prescreened list is merely an indication that the consumers on the list might be qualified for the loan or credit account offered , if the credit bureau 's files are current , if the prescreening process was properly performed , and if the consumers on the list meet the other characteristics which were selected in advance by the credit grantor and could not be determined from the credit bureau 's records .... <p> Materials are provided to consumers on the list through the use of one of three alternatives . Under the first alternative , the prescreened list is provided directly to the credit grantor who then mails the materials to each consumer on the list . Under the second alternative , the credit grantor never actually receives the prescreened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the list . Rather , the credit grantor instructs the credit bureau to mail directly to the consumers on the prescreened list the materials furnished by the credit grantor .... <p> When the third alternative is used ... the credit bureau provides a prescreened list to a third party that sends to consumers on the list the materials concerning the product offered . In some instances , the third party may simply be a mailing service ... in any event the third party has no knowledge of the characteristics used by the credit bureau to compile the list . <p> ... the credit grantor may obtain an actual credit report on each consumer who subsequently decides to respond to the credit grantor 's offer . The credit report may be used , for example , to determine whether the consumer is eligible to receive a higher level of credit than that originally offered by the credit grantor . <p> YOU CAN ' OPT OUT ' <p> You can have your name removed from any direct marketing solicitation which uses data from a credit reporting repository .
