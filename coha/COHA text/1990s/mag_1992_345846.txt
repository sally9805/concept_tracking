As moviegoers munch their popcorn before the main feature starts these days , many of them see an earnest commercial in which actor James Earl Jones urges President Bush to make a vital trip to Brazil this June . People who want to deliver the same message directly to the White House can call an 800 number and for $6.95 send a personalized " Earth Telegram " to Washington . <P> These gimmicks are part of a determined campaign by environmental groups to pressure the President into being part of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , which is expected to be the largest gathering of world leaders in history  --  and could be the most important . But with less than three months left before the meeting , Bush has still not revealed his plans . Says Senator Al Gore , a Tennessee Democrat : " History has given President Bush a mandate to lead at this critical junction and he has not fulfilled it . It 's a disgrace . " <P> The goal of the United Nations-sponsored summit is dauntingly ambitious : to chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth 's air , land and water and protect the multitudes of animals and plants threatened with extinction . The organizers of the meeting , officially called the U.N . Conference on Environment and Development , intend to produce several landmark documents , including an Earth Charter ( a set of principles designed to ensure environmental protection and responsible development ) , a program of action called Agenda 21 and treaties aimed at curbing climate change and limiting the loss of biodiversity . <P> The danger is that these agreements will be vague and unenforceable , a cosmetic solution not backed by political will .

A report released this month summing up the Administration 's official attitude toward the issues has been widely criticized as being long on statistics but short on solutions . The paper gives little attention to the Rio summit 's central theme : the need for sustainable development in which economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources . For example , the Administration acknowledges the need for a global policy to protect forests , but offers no specific proposals . <P> Most disturbing has been the White House 's resistance to any targets or timetables for cutting down on production of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide , which may lead to global warming . The European Community wants to reduce CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 , but America 's refusal to go along has effectively stymied the latest round of climate-change negotiations . Environmentalists , and even the conference organizers , argue that the U.S. , as the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases , has an enormous responsibility to be cooperative on this issue . The Americans say that adopting specific goals not only would be costly but could also put U.S. industries at a competitive disadvantage in the world marketplace .
