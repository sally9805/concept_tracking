There was always the whiff of the charlatan about John Cage . The puckish composer , audacious theoretician , stylish writer , subtle graphic artist , macrobiotic guru and fearless mushroom hunter was the impish personification of the 20th century avant-garde . Arch , soft-spoken and witty , Cage was passionately adored by his acolytes right up to his death at age 79 in 1992 , and continues to be regarded by some as a kind of contemporary Beethoven , his influence ranging as far afield as Germany and Japan ( where he is a demigod ) . And yet : Was there ever a composer of whom it can be said that his most representative and perhaps best work is one that consists of four minutes and 33 seconds of silence ? <P> Not exactly silence . During the course of 4 ' 33 " , which Cage composed ( conceived ? ) in 1952 , the pianist sits quietly at the keyboard , but nature  --  in the form of coughs , whispers , rustles , the 60-cycle hum of electric lights and the rush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When I was setting out to devote my life to music , " Cage wrote in 1974 , " people distinguished between musical sounds and noises . I . . . fought for noises . " So defined , Cage found " music " everywhere : in the kitchen , in technology ( HPSCHD , a seminal electronic collaboration with composer Lejaren Hiller ) , in numerology and , most important , in the 3,000-year-old Chinese Book of Changes called the I Ching , whose random , coin-tossed hexagrams formed the basis of the aleatoric , or chance , music he so loved . <P> In writings that spanned the most important creative years of his life  --  his books include Silence , M , Empty Words and X  --  Cage extended his compositional processes to include other media . To satisfy his love of words , he invented " mesostics , " in which a given piece of writing ( Finnegans Wake was a favorite ) serves as the raw material for a poem derived by finding and capitalizing the letters of the subject 's name ( James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reading down .

Was Cage the great artist his admirers proclaim , or was he merely an ersatz Dadaist , proudly parading around in his emperor 's new clothes as he pursued a whole-grain , crackpot anarchism ?
