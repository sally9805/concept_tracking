Japanese besuboru is not exactly the same as American baseball . And that fact hit Mike Di Muro with all the force of a beanball . Di Muro , a 29-year-old pro umpire from New York , was invited this spring to step onto Japan 's diamonds and teach the American meaning of a strike . But Di Muro soon learned that it 's less hazardous to face Roberto Alomar 's spit than the wrath of Japanese players and fans who do n't like the call . <P> The low point came during a June 5 game in the central city of Gifu , when the burly Di Muro called two strikes on popular Chunichi Dragons slugger Yasuaki Taiho . Taiho did n't appreciate it much , and let Di Muro know it . Since American umpires take less guff than their Japanese counterparts , Di Muro tossed Taiho out of the game . That touched off a melee . The crowd jeered at the American , and coaches and players charged him . Taiho repeatedly shoved Di Muro in the chest . The end result : U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taiho played ball as usual . <P> Of all the U.S.-Japan disputes over the years , concerning everything from auto shipments to whaling , this latest dustup may be the hardest to comprehend . Baseball is , after all , an American game . If the Japanese did n't want to learn from an American umpire , then why did they ask him to get behind home plate ? <P> The answer may lie in Japan 's typically ambivalent attitude toward opening up to the rest of the world . While Japan limits the number of foreign baseball players it imports , the country still wants to reach U.S. standards , so that a Japanese team could someday meet the American champs in a real World Series . That goal finally seems plausible , now that Japan 's Hideo Nomo has become an All-Star in the U.S. , and New York Yankee farmhand Hideki Irabu is mowing down American batters with 99 m.p.h. fast balls . <P> But the convergence of baseball and besuboru apparently has n't gone far enough to let an American umpire in Japan . Those who thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese game , which is run by a cabal of players and managers as protectively as the Finance and Trade ministries are captained for the good of the economy . Di Muro 's insistence on standing by his strike and ball calls upset the system 's harmony  --  what the Japanese call wa , as besuboru expert Robert Whiting wrote in his 1989 book You Got ta Have Wa . <P> The Di Muro affair is a reminder that the harmony between the U.S. and Japan is still fragile . U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky certainly wo n't bother pushing Japan to take in American umpires the way Washington once demanded the country import more Louisville Slugger bats . But Japan 's trade surplus with the U.S. is once again rising at an alarming rate . At this weekend 's Denver summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations , the U.S. will push Japan to open its economy further . " Japan 's bureaucrats talk all the time about how they have an open market and believe in internationalization , " says Robert M. Orr , a baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Japan . " But then when it breaks up the harmony of the system , Japan 's knee-jerk reaction is to claim special rules . "
