For seven long months in 1988 , there were no public libraries in Shasta County , Calif . There were more than 143,000 people , 3,850 square miles , but not a single public library . It was not a strike , earthquake , series of fires , or anything quite so dramatic that caused library doors to remain closed . It was something much quieter , much more insidious , and ultimately much more destructive  --  funding cuts . Shasta 's reductions were more dramatic than most , but funding cuts for library services are reaching crisis levels all over the country . Even now , the situation in Shasta County is not much better . Library services have been restored in only three branches . One is open just 30 hours per week ; another 20 hours . Given the size of the county and the distance between these branches , an afternoon walk  --  or even drive  --  to the public library is still an impossibility for many area residents . Local officials warn that the situation may not be resolved for another four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in Shasta County have nowhere to go to check out a book , do research , or ask a reference question . Children can not stop by the public library after school to do homework or borrow a book to read for pleasure . For them , the library no longer exists . " Without a public library , where do people go for information ? , " asked John McCracken , director of the library system at the time of the closings . " They do n't get it anywhere . " This may sound like an isolated case of hard times in rural America , but economic constraints exist just about everywhere . Libraries from coast to coast are reducing their hours , freezing acquisitions of new books , canceling or reducing periodical subscriptions , closing children 's rooms , eliminating literacy workshops  --  some even closing their doors altogether  --  because the money that used to be available to support high-quality library services for everyone seems to have all but disappeared . Some people probably are not alarmed by this prospect , especially if they think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at best , a " cultural frill . " However , what that building , its contents , and the people who run it represent is one of the most fundamental rights we have as American citizens : the right to information , knowledge , and all the benefits that this knowledge and information deliver  --  the right to know . The spotlight must be turned on this right because we are in serious danger of losing it ; this is crucial to an informed , just , and equitable society ; without it , we are far too vulnerable to the power of those who would like to abridge the right to make our own decisions ; and children in places like Shasta County should not have to grow up without access to the treasures of a library . When Benjamin Franklin 's novel idea , the free public library , came to fruition more than 200 years ago , it was based on what was considered a radical concept in its time  --  equal access to and distribution of books to everyone , without regard to age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more than 115,000 public , academic , school , and special libraries in the U.S. working together to honor that tradition . They are a national treasure , offering access not only to books , but to databases , computer software , recordings , special programs  --  whatever will meet people 's information needs . As libraries are forced to tighten their belts more and more , America 's right to know is being strangled . The effects are being felt in all types and sizes of libraries across the country . The following are just a few examples : * In Gray , Me. , public library funding cuts have forced a reduction in hours from 40 to 16 per week , reduced the staff to one , and cut the book budget by more than one-half over the past five years . * Mount Holly ( N.J. ) Public Library , granted its original charter by King George III in 1765 , recently was closed for over a year because of a lack of funds . * In California , the number of school libraries has been cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent statistics , only about 1,000 of California 's 7,350 schools now have libraries or media centers. * In Massachusetts , about 30% of the state 's public libraries have reduced hours substantially , more than one-third have cut book budgets , and many branches have closed altogether over the past two years . * Special populations are losing their right to knowledge as the Atlanta-Fulton County ( Ga . ) Public Library , which traditionally has been dedicated to bringing library services to special populations , cuts programs . Bookmobiles that once served remote areas of the county have been parked indefinitely ; senior citizens ' centers have lost their services , which were provided through a special library outreach project ; and the Story Caravan , which brought books , storytelling programs , and puppet shows to day care units in public housing complexes , has stopped touring . * Academic libraries also are suffering because of deeply cut Federal and state support for higher education . In 1991 , Stanford University , one of our leading academic institutions , asked its libraries to implement a 16% staff budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for staff and for the library 's collections . Cuts in book budgets , like those facing libraries from Brooklyn , N.Y. , to Belen , N.M. , are among the most devastating effects of all reduction measures . The immediate result  --  the unavailability of a desired title  --  is maddening for the library user and abridges his or her right to that information . The long-term effect is worse  --  even a temporary interruption in new book acquisitions can prevent certain titles from ever making it onto the library shelves . This means that future generations of library users also will be deprived of this material unless they purchase it themselves . THE HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS Library budget cuts are a quiet , but powerful , force . They are moving us closer and closer to a society of information haves and have-nots . The haves are those who are lucky enough to live close to a public library that is open a reasonable number of hours ( and has a well-maintained collection ) ; children whose schools have thriving library/media programs ; students and professors at academic institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough money to buy whatever information they need . The have-nots are those who are losing their access to libraries , knowledge , and one of the most powerful opportunities they have for achieving personal growth and economic success . A library card can be a ticket out of the ghetto for a disadvantaged youth , but only if he or she has access to a decent library . People of all ages and backgrounds are served by libraries . One does n't have to be in school , broke , or in trouble to benefit . Even the information haves are losing something valuable if they simply buy whatever information they need at the local bookstore . For all the good service booksellers provide , they are not librarians . Only librarians help people take the data that is available in books and put it in some context for the information-seeker . The mission of the librarian goes beyond filling specific factual needs . It is to help people solve information problems and turn raw data to knowledge . To whom are we going to turn with these problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like an idle question , but , with the staffing cuts that have become necessary as budgets are slashed , patrons soon may be finding more and more empty reference desks in America 's libraries . The issue of library funding is complex and problematic because of stiff competition for Federal , state , and local funds . Yet , these institutions are among the most efficient of all public services . Public libraries , for example , serve 66% of the American public with less than one percent of our tax dollars . They cost taxpayers about $15 each  --  less than dinner for two in a moderate restaurant . The Federal government spends some $25,000,000 more annually on military bands than it does on libraries . In fact , 25 years of Federal library funding does not even equal the cost of one aircraft carrier . Some communities and their legislators do realize that libraries provide vital services we can not afford to lose  --  and that a strong library system can actually save public money in the long run . One example of progressive civic leadership in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their long-term value . Through a project called the Neighborhood Pride and Protection Program , public libraries are one of several city units that are working to keep young people out of gangs and away from drugs . The library system has targeted branches in some of the highest-risk areas of the city for youth and added homework centers , tutoring services , special collections , extended evening hours , and other attractions . Instead of being cut , the public library 's 1991 budget was increased by 16% , in large part because of its participation in the program . " The rationale is that if we put more money into libraries now and keep our youth off the street , we 'll be putting less money into jails and police protection later on , " explains Carol Young , the library 's administrative analyst . " It 's a different , more pro-active way of looking at library services . " It was clear the people of San Diego wanted strong library services . They attended City Council meetings in droves , voiced their opinions , and voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . San Diego residents are not alone  --  quality library services are a high priority for most Americans . For example : * Two-thirds of U.S. adults use the library at least once a year . * Circulation of library materials is up dramatically , with public libraries now circulating more than 1,000,000,000 items per year . Circulation to adults has risen 10% and circulation to children has gone up 54% over the past decade . * A recent study cited school libraries as the leading variable for predicting outstanding student achievement among different schools . * Academic libraries serve an estimated 12,000,000 students , faculty , scholars , and researchers . Public library funding proposals have been approved in 75% of city elections that included them ( in areas with populations over 25,000 ) , and some communities even pay special taxes just to make sure the quality of their library services remains high . These taxes still are relatively rare , but this sort of funding can make a huge difference in a library 's  --  and a community 's  --  future . Berkeley ( Calif . ) Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget because of a voter-approved tax . Private funding efforts to support libraries also are on the rise . A group of elementary school children in Brooklyn , N.Y. , collected $300 in pennies to help keep theirs afloat . However , most public libraries will have to continue to depend on the mix of local , state , Federal , and private funds that combine to form the usual budget : 80.2% come from local governments ; 8.0% from the state ; 1.4% from the Federal government ; and 9.4% from other income . SLASHED BUDGETS Although Federal funds make up less than two cents of the national public library dollar , this is a very important component . It supports library construction , new technology , services for the blind , and other special projects and services . Federal support for Department of Education library programs was $143,000,000 in 1991 , but the President 's 1992 budget recommended cuts of more than 75% to $35,000,000 . The loss of state funds imperils libraries even more , since they account for a larger piece of the pie . Michigan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are experiencing deep statewide funding cuts . To make matters worse , local appropriations to public libraries also have been shrinking all over the U.S. Budget cuts have gotten so bad that Washington 's Supervisor for Learning Resources recently said that most school libraries in his state receive about half the funds they need to maintain quality collections . Moreover , across-the-board cuts in Federal and state support for higher education have affected academic libraries , which receive about three percent of current-fund expenditures by colleges and universities . Making the sting of these cuts even worse are the rapidly rising costs of library materials . Using a $1,000,000 figure as a base , officials at the Chicago Public Library noted a 58% decrease in their purchasing power for that amount of money from 1977 to 1989 . According to another study , the price of hardcover fiction rose 162% from 1977 to 1986 and periodicals went up 264% over the same period . Soaring serial costs are attacking many academic libraries already reeling from budget cuts . Despite the problems they face , libraries and librarians never have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults and their families ; new technological services for students and business people ; AIDS information ; and programs for latchkey children and their families . Across the country , librarians are designing innovative services to help people use and share information resources to their fullest potential and to assist people in exercising their right to know . Librarians also are involved actively in protecting our right to know outside the library . They are leaders in the fight against censorship , as the number of challenged titles increases every year . They also are struggling to retain the public 's access to government information , which is being controlled more and more by private companies , so that data about what the government is doing is available to everyone , not just those who can pay for it . In June , 1991 , the American Library Association launched a campaign to alert the public to the funding crisis and show the policymakers that library service is critical to their communities . To succeed , we need massive public support . Here are some of the actions concerned people can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand that library services be viewed ( and funded ) not as a frill , but as a basic right we are not willing to give up . * Attend city and town council meetings and urge local legislators to invest in libraries as a community resource , one that will save substantial tax dollars in the long run . * Elect leaders who believe in and will support strong library services . * Support library referenda in elections . * Contact your local library to see if they need help . Ask if they have a Friends of Libraries group you can join . * Tell administrators and legislators that library services are an integral part of education and urge that our school and academic library services be funded adequately . Libraries and librarians are essential to American society . Libraries keep books and other materials affordable , accessible , and available . They have enabled millions to learn , discover , and prosper . Their very existence stands in defense of the First Amendment and in defense of equality . All countries support hospitals , governments , and schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services are threatened and librarians are not valued , the very basis of our democracy and our culture is at risk . We are at risk of losing the right to remember our past , understand our present , and think constructively about a better future . By speaking out now , we can protect not just the future of libraries and librarians , but the future of the American people 's right to know .
