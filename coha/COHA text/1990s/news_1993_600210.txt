" It 's madness . " <p> Take the case of James and Jennifer Stolpa , who were lost with their infant son , Clayton , in a Nevada snowstorm in December 1992 . When they entered a Reno hospital afterward , they were met not just by news reporters waiting to hear their story , but a record 70 producers wanting to turn their tale into a TV movie . <p> Producer Michael Jaffe won with a check for a reported $ 500,000 , said to be the biggest bounty for TV movie rights . It 'll air next season on CBS . <p> Weeks later , Rob and Dee Dubin got lost in the snow , this time in Aspen on a cross-country skiing trip . After they were found , they signed on with the William Morris Agency to peddle their story . No takers yet . <p> " The fact that an event happened does n't mean automatically that you should turn it into a movie , " says CBS TV movie chief John Matoian , who turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But ( the Stolpas ' ) story was man against nature and a classic love story about sacrifice , determination and courage .

Within a few months , 30 producers including Carol Burnett and America 's Most Wanted host John Walsh had contacted them . <p> " We kept sitting around saying , ' this is n't happening ' , " says Liz . " Our life is so boring . Why would anyone want to make a movie about it ? " <p> Ratings and profits , perhaps ? <p> First-time newsmakers are n't the only ones bombarded by Hollywood producers network executives are , too . <p> " It really gets tiring , " says CBS ' Matoian . " To get these calls ' Hey , did you hear about the lady who murdered her husband ? Want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to exploit a headline without any reason to tell the story . " <p> On the day the bomb went off at the World Trade Center , Matoian 's office received 15 calls from producers . <p> When a story is really hot , producers attack it from several angles , seeking rights of the main party , the party 's boyfriend , friend of the family , even the reporter who covered the story . <p> " What 's really hard about this job , " says ABC 's Parkin , " is to sort out the various sets of rights . You 've got a million people coming at you , they 're all terrific salesmen , and you 've got to make some sort of judgment call . " <p> How do producers win rights amid such heated pursuit ? <p> " It usually has to do with competitive financial terms , reputation , experience , point of view and personality , " says Jaffe .

They turned down Michael Jaffe , but that did n't stop him from making a Gregory K. film anyway , based on court transcripts . It aired in January ; CBS ' airs April 4 . <p> " People kept telling us that it was inevitable that somebody would make a TV movie about us , so we might as well get involved , " says Russ , who discovered that ABC could do it anyway , without their help . <p> The network went the public domain route , using public records to tell a story , a technique ABC also used with its Amy Fisher movie , which turned out to be the highest-rated of the three Fisher films . <p> " One of the best things that happened to us was that we did n't get the Buttafuoco rights , " says Parkin . " We did n't think so at the time , but it enabled us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBS went the official route for Gregory K. , too . A Place To Be Loved stars Linda Kelsey and Richard Crenna as the adoptive parents of the boy . Polson is n't worried about it being the second Gregory K. film out there . <p> " We were n't under the gun of ' let 's be first ' , " she says . " We 've taken the time to examine what was going on with these people 's lives . " <p> And with the growing boom in prime-time newsmagazines which report stories that often end up as TV movies TV movie and news divisions are learning to work together . <p> Before ABC 's Day One debuted , Parkin and his staff met with producers of the new news show to make sure they would n't collide , since Day One at 8 p.m . ET/PT leads into ABC 's 9 p.m . Sunday movie . <p> " We were working on a lot of the same stories , " says Parkin . " It was amazing how closely our worlds had merged .

Within a week , NBC Productions was in Miami , beginning pre-production and locking up Norcross ' rights . The film will feature original WTVJ footage of the hurricane . Says Lobo , " I 'm delighted .
