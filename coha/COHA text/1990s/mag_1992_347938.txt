THEY DO N'T JUST ROB BANKS , THEY ASSAULT THEM  --  FIRING wildly , leaping over counters , fondling the women , shooting at the men . The FBI believes the new bank terrorists are L.A. GANG MEMBERS who pulled off 193 heists last year and 363 so far this year . Agents dubbed the first duo they arrested the Nasty Boys , who are thought to have robbed $800,000 from 28 banks since October 1991 . The pair , Clarence Sanders , 21 , and Harold Walden , 19 , were convicted of five of the robberies in November . Prosecutors and the FBI expect the two to get the maximum penalty of 75 years apiece when they appear for sentencing next month . <P>
