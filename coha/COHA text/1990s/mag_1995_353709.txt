A year has passed since president Ernesto Samper Pizano of Colombia was first accused of taking millions of dollars for his 1994 presidential campaign from the cocaine-rich Rodriguez brothers of Cali  --  time enough for him to emerge as a strong and conscientious leader . A poll two weeks ago by Semana magazine gave Samper a 63% approval rating . Last week , however , all that trust came unraveled . Explosive allegations by a former close aide implicated Samper more forcefully than ever , and brought the survival of his presidency into doubt . <P> Media commentators made comparisons to Watergate and repeated the familiar questions from the 1970s scandal that brought down Richard Nixon : What did the President know , and when did he know it ? Did he try to cover up ? Will he step down ? <P> The first victim of last week 's political storm was Defense Minister Fernando Botero Zea , 39 , who resigned amid accusations that he had received almost $6 million in contributions from the Cali cartel when he was Samper 's campaign manager . Botero 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested two weeks ago after a police raid turned up a check made out to him by a cartel front company . <P> Medina , under questioning by investigators for Colombia 's independent chief prosecutor , Alfonso Valdivieso , not only gave up Botero but also claimed that the dirty money was raised with Samper 's full knowledge . <P> Samper , 45 , said he would answer Medina 's charges " one by one . " Botero  --  whose father Fernando Botero Angulo is Colombia 's most famous painter  --  also denied the accusations , saying he only stepped down so he could devote time to preparing his defense . " I can not prolong a situation in which my personal integrity and my family 's honor are questioned , " he said . <P> The irony of last week 's sensational disclosures was that in recent months Botero , who was in charge of both the military and the national police , had been decimating the Cali cartel 's formidable drug hierarchy . Behind bars after 15 years of activity were billionaire Cali kingpins Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and Jose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jose Rosso Serrano , is said to be on the trail of the two remaining major Cali mobsters , Rodriguez 's younger brother Miguel and Helmer " Pacho " Herrera . <P> Given Botero 's success , U.S. officials , who had been pressuring the Samper government to crack down on the drug mafia , greeted the Defense Minister 's resignation with mixed emotions . " This guy was pushing very , very hard for the right results , " said a ranking U.S. policy hand . " He 's been very helpful . " Other U.S. agents , however , bolstered Medina 's story when they found two Chase Manhattan Bank accounts in New York that appeared to be linked to Samper 's inner circle . Medina says that a Chase account was used to launder the Cali funds . <P> The document that brought Botero down and damaged Samper was the record of a July 28 interrogation of Medina that was stolen or leaked from Valdivieso 's office . In the transcript Medina says that on April 29 , 1994 , Botero gave him the go-ahead to seek funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign . Medina ultimately received , he said , two payments totaling $5.9 million .
