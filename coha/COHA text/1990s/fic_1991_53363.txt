Section : Pamela Painter " Is this Lorraine Hennesey ? " the woman wants to know as I lift the phone up to the bed . It 's 3 A.M. Hennesey ? Hennesey is the name I acquired in my second marriage  --  still a little strange even after two years . Especially in the middle of the night . " Yes ? " <p> " Who is it , Lore ? " Sam asks from behind me as he feels for the light switch . <p> " Well , Mrs. Hennesey , and your husband 's name is Samuel ? " <p> " Who is this ? " I say , hoping the twins wo n't wake up . <p> " Well , we need to talk , Mrs. Hennesey . Your husband got my Rosie pregnant . And now we need a little money to take care of things . " <p> " Good Lord , " I say , slamming down the , phone . I lean over to put it back on the floor . <p> " What was that ? " Sam squints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureau . <p> " Some drunk , " I say and sink back into my pillow , pulling the covers up as Sam flips off the light . <p> The phone rings again . <p> " Do n't you hang up on me again . We need to talk about my Rosie , " the voice says . She goes right on not waiting for me to say a thing . She tells me she could n't sleep a wink after her daughter told her everything . She says she just had to call me . There are sounds in the background that I ca n't make out . Rosie crying , or a cat . She says that accounts for Rosie feeling so poorly these last weeks , what with morning sickness so bad she ca n't go to work . " He 's no good , that husband of yours . " She stops as if out of breath . or as if she 's come to the end of some sales pitch like people selling stuff over the phone at Christmas  --  light bulbs , wreaths . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hoist myself up on my elbow . " This shit is n't going to work , " I say . " You just take your finger and move it down the phone book a name or two . You got the wrong number here . " I hang up so hard it probably hurts her ear . <p> The light comes on . " Jesus , Lore . What now ? " Sam asks , squinting at me . He 's up on his elbow . His white T-shirt hurts my eyes . <p> " Same one . Some lady says you got her Rosie pregnant . She wants money . " I nudge him to turn off the light . <p> His eyebrows come together . " Wh-at . " <p> " Never mind . Go back to sleep . " I rub his face where it 's creased from the pillow . The radiators are turned off for the night , so I pull my hand back under the covers . <p> We both listen for another ring . <p> Finally , he snaps off the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his shoulder . " Ummm , " he says . Soon his breathing goes deep as he sinks into sleep . <p> But I ca n't follow . Fear is pumping through my heart like poison . I thought all that was behind me with the divorce and marrying Sam . So what made me hang up so fast ? Why was I so damn sure they were calling names out of the phone book , looking for an easy buck ? <p> I toss back and forth and wish the cat would come in to get warm . outside , telephone lines slice the moon in half . Frost rises on the windows . I close my eyes , but ca n't sleep . The phone does n't ring again , although most of my married life with Nick I felt prepared for it . Now my mind goes crazy with remembering the bad times . <p> Four years ago , still married to Nick ' I might have hung up . But probably not . <p> Nick , snoring behind me , might have awakened , fumbled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have slid away from Nick 's side of the bed and cupped my hand around the receiver . Talking real low , I would have asked , " Who is this ? " expecting some incredible , but specific , answer . I 'd have listened hard , already conjuring Rosie with dark curls and a slutty smile flashing over a plastic name tag on some waitress 's uniform or plant supervisor 's pocket . <p> That voice might even have sounded familiar , as familiar as she wanted it to sound at 3 A.M. I know this : I would not have hung up . <p> I 'd have whispered , ' Who is this ? " She would have told me about Rosie 's or Joy 's or Rayjean 's awkward situation . How my husband led her girl astray . How my husband failed to mention he was married with kids and all until it was too late . <p> " Where 'd they meet ? " I 'd ask , picturing his string of favorite bars between the factory and our door . or company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuzzy legs in shorts , pulling him aside for tense conversations after too many beers . Back then , I thought walking away from a husband was n't done . So , I 'd have asked , " How do they know each other ? " <p> She 'd just say we have to meet . I should bring money for the clinic  --  about $250  --  and that would be the end of it . She 'd say they would only talk to me , not to bring my hubby . He probably would n't come anyway , she 'd say . He 'd probably deny the whole thing ever happened . Besides , her Rosie did n't want nothing more to do with him . " If I were you I 'd keep him out of this , " she 'd say . " I 'll be calling you tomorrow . " <p> I 'm back in my old apartment , SUNOCO shining in from the hill by the interstate , the neighbor 's dog barking at raccoons . Would I have flicked on the light , turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till morning to bring the subject up . or , more likely , waited for the next call , for the bad directions and miscounted stoplights to some bar named Joe 's or Al 's <p> Then , on the day of the meeting , I 'd have dressed with a little more care . Maybe my pink angora sweater just to show them I was n't some slouch , a wife who 'd let herself go . But nothing too fancy because there 'd be no sense looking like I was made out of money . And sure as hell I ca n't compete with an eighteen-year-old . I would have slammed out of the house early to borrow money from Dots or Betty if they had enough to spare , my sister as a last resort . I 'll explain later , I 'd say , and they 'd know by my grim look that , once again , whatever it was it had to do with Nick . <p> I would have taken extra time on my lunch hour , telling my boss it was personal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd have pulled into the parking lot at Sal 's Bar and Grill , sat in a back booth , maybe ordered a Seven and Seven . I 'd have the money in my purse on my lap when Rosie and her mother appeared . <p> They 'd arrive in a yellow cab or rusted-out car which would slowly circle the block . They 'd be all dressed up in bright colors , perfume , bracelets , and large earrings . Rosie would look like all the rest . Even different , they somehow looked the same  --  wet-eyed , second-runner-up pretty , and too young . <p> Rosie would be nervous meeting me , or maybe nervous from all those rehearsals , memorizing her lines . Rosie 's mother would look around the place good before she pulled her daughter over to my table , her hand clapped hard to Rosie 's elbow . She 'd push Rosie into the booth first , then slide in beside her too close . They 'd order something before we talked as if this were a social occasion , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother would ask what was this world coming to . She 'd ignore my questions and poke at Rosie 's sullen cheek , cluck her tongue over my being married to such a man . I had her full sympathy , she 'd say . Her purse would be flat on her lap waiting . <p> " Do n't worry , " she 'd assure me , leaning forward over the Formica table , her ample bust ( like Rosie 's ) welcoming the temporary shelf . " After this $250 , you wo n't hear from us again . " <p> I would put off paying her until the last possible moment . <p> I would gather up my keys and throw a ten on the table for the drinks . <p> I would stare at Rosie till she looked away . Finally at that point , I would have had to decide . <p>
