Section : FINE-TUNING THE FREE MARKET There are lots of things the government should train the poor to do . Sculpting nails is n't one of them . <p> Tommy Wayne Downs spent the eighties in the ghettoes of Nashville , selling permanent waves as the path to the American dream . With just six months ' training at his school of hair design , Downs cajoled , erstwhile welfare moms could earn $30,000 a year as stylists in Nashville 's tonier salons . <p> If Downs had a talent for this rags-to-riches spiel , it was probably because their rags were his riches : for every poor student he lured in , he reaped thousands of dollars in federal student aid . Guaranteed student aid , intended by Congress to ensure all students an affordable education , whether at Harvard or Downs 's school of hair design . <p> Before long , though , Downs discovered an easier way than ghetto-combing to drum up federal student loans : eliminate the middleman  --  the student . One March day , he simply made up a name , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guaranteed federal loan on the imaginary student 's behalf . To his astonishment , it worked . So he tried again and again . By the time his secretary inadvertently tipped off the feds a few years later , his ghost graduates had reaped hundreds of thousands of dollars in government loans . Why 'd he do it ? To an entrepreneur like Downs , that 's a pretty stupid question . " I mean , you are talking about the ability to steal unfathomable amounts of money . " <p> In 1989 , Downs was sentenced to 11 years in prison for criminal fraud and ordered to repay $175,000 ; to the Department of Education , this case is closed . But in their own way , the feds too forgot the middlemen  --  the thousands of real students who mistook Downs 's entrepreneurial zeal for a genuine educational opportunity . Today , many of the men and women who viewed his federally sanctioned trade school as a ticket out of poverty are still holed up in the Nashville projects . Only now , they owe thousands in loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaping a fortune in federal aid . But in the crazy world of government-subsidized vocational education , that offense is unindictable . <p> During the eighties , countless Hirsches and Blooms stepped forward to deplore the quality of elite education . Yet few discussed the trade school training available to the 50 percent of Americans who will never go to college at all . " Noncollege youth , " sociologists call them , defining them by what they do n't have . That 's not just an accident of semantics . Although 82 million U.S. jobs do n't require a college degree , our education system has long been geared to train the white-collar class . <p> That 's never been more true than now , as basic academics reclaim high school classrooms , and vocational training falls by the wayside . In itself , mind you , that 's a pretty smart move : deciding which 14-year-old gets Wordsworth and which gets welding is simply too dangerous a responsibility for a school system as marred by racism and classism as ours . Besides , research consistently shows that solid reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minutiae of some ever-changing technology . Yet , as the public schools retrench , more of America 's blue- and pink-collar workforce now spawns in private institutions  --  which spawns the likes of Tommy Wayne Downs . <p> Today , more than 2 million U.S. students attend 4,000 accredited private trade schools , the ugly stepchild of American higher education . With their six- to twelve-month courses for incipient truckers , computer repairmen , secretaries , and beauticians , those schools consume nearly 30 percent of the federal government 's grants and guaranteed loans for higher education . That 's not an inexpensive phenomenon . Thanks to an annual $2 billion federal liability for defaulted school loans  --  a disproportionate percentage of it from trade schools  --  the federal student aid program now teeters , in the words of Senator Sam Nunn , " on the brink of disaster . " <p> But while sensational default costs earn headlines and congressional hearings , they 're a symptom of more subtle , basic flaws : the quality and kind of training we eagerly subsidize for millions of noncollege youth . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal loans and grants went to the following federally approved institutions : <p> The Culinary School of Washington , whose students paid $6,900 for the privilege of frying eggs and flipping burgers  --  without pay  --  in the cafeteria of a local sewage treatment plant . <p> A Miami respiratory therapist training school with broken equipment and a notable entrance : a hole blasted in the drywall of an X-rated record and tape store . <p> A Chicago trucking school that enrolled students too physically disabled to turn the steering wheel or reach the gears . <p> An Ohio heating and ventilation repair school housed in a fruit stand , whose students scavenged garbage dumps for broken equipment to work on . <p> Finding glaring educational failures in the federal student loan program is like hunting in a wildlife preserve  --  there are almost too many easy targets . But federally accredited fruit stands are less amusing when you consider that trade schools like these produce more than a third of America 's front-line work force . And you do n't have to look at the stagnant GNP to realize it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alliance of Business , 75 percent of CEOs observe declining skills in their entry-level workforce ; Industry Week notes that two-thirds of American personnel officers report difficulty finding workers with adequate technical skills . <p> By the year 2000 , the skill gap may grow even wider , as nearly half of America 's new jobs will require vocational training . But do n't count on trade schools to bridge the chasm . They currently offer more programs for cosmetologists , radio and TV broadcasters , and casino dealers than for respiratory therapists and X-ray technicians , though the latter are among America 's most undermanned occupations . And in the name of lean , mean , free-market education , the federal government graciously funds them all . <p> As the Department of Education crunches loan-default numbers , it overlooks the real bottom line : whether students get genuine , marketable skills for their billions in federally guaranteed grants and loans . With no safeguards on educational quality and little connection to labor market needs , the answer all too often is no . That brain drain has a higher psychic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cinderella schools <p> Heffley &; Brown Secretarial Schools . Rutledge College . Barclay Career Schools . The names may be cribbed from Burke 's Peerage , but the longing is straight out of Dreiser : to grasp the bottom rungs of the bourgeoisie . <p> In the neat mauve-and-paisley waiting room of PTC Career Institute , D.C. 's largest trade school , a young woman nervously queries the receptionist . " Do you take people in the halfway house ? I 've heard some schools do n't take people from the halfway house .... " And what , the woman asks , about her boyfriend , still asleep at noon ? Wake him up and get him down here , advises the receptionist , kindly proffering a phone . <p> These days , as grocery stores and other institutions pack up and flee the center city , trade school fliers and friendly sales reps remain a constant of urban life . Yet the impulse behind such recruitment is n't altruism ; it 's economics . The poorer the student , the greater the amount of federal financial aid  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criterion for admission . <p> Recruiters for D.C. 's Barclay schools use a Haines reverse telephone directory to make their quota . Flipping past Georgetown , Cleveland Park , and other well-appointed neighborhoods , they swiftly zero in on the slums . " You call 31st Street Southeast in the middle of the afternoon and hear " Gilligan 's Island " in the background , " says one agent , " and you know you 've hit the jackpot . " <p> Jackpot , indeed . While the number of traditional college students fell off during the eighties , trade school enrollment swelled as much as 13 percent a year . Thanks to 1988 's federal Family Support Act , the figures for the nineties may be even higher , as states are forced to enroll 20 percent of their welfare clients in educational or job training by 1995 in order to retain federal public assistance . <p> To most observers , a booming trade school business seems like good news not just for the underclass , but for America , whose training gap has become a political cliche . Rectifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind when it welcomed proprietary schools into federal student aid programs back in the seventies  --  an educational reform made possible by a rare confluence of liberal sentiment and free-market infatuation . With a little federal funding , private schools would be able to train the noncollege workforce more cheaply and efficiently than logy government programs ever could . Paradoxically  --  as with today 's celebrated school choice proposals  --  these " market " schools would also be fueled by a vast injection of public money . To the vestigial Great Society sensibility , restricting loans to four-year colleges was elitist . The catch-verb was " democratize . " <p> " It was a great issue of educational access and civil rights , " says Jeffrey Plaut , who recently studied New York state 's private trade schools for the nonprofit group , Interface . " But they only got half of the equation . Government created a market for these schools by infusing hundreds of millions of dollars , but then stood back and allowed the industry to regulate itself . And now they wonder why it turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry paid ex-Department of Education officials handsomely to help it pilot the shoals of federal loan programs , the feds deputized a fraud squad straight out of Mayberry : a handful of trade school " accrediting agencies " made up of , and largely funded by , trade school operators . ( Evaluating Tennessee schools for one such agency was that educational arbiter Tommy Wayne Downs . ) Having obtained a state license and having been recognized by his accrediting agency colleagues , a trade school owner could apply for eligibility for federal grants and loans  --  a complicated , time-consuming procedure with roughly the same results as a rubber stamp . Between ' 86 and ' 88 , 97 percent of the 2,870 trade schools that asked for federal money ultimately got it  --  even though the Department of Education 's inspector general later found 38 percent of them financially or administratively " deficient . " <p> And what of educationally deficient ? The feds ca n't say : in most cases , they 've never even seen the schools . " Examination of educational quality . . . is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Education has no authority to make it so , " Inspector General James Thomas recently reassured the public . " Thus as long as an institution is financially strong and capable of administering Title IV programs , the department can not deny participation even if educational programs lack merit . " <p> Small wonder , then , that Florida 's American Career Training Schools , a travel-agent and secretary training academy , spent 52 percent of its money on advertising and sales reps in 1989 , and barely 2 percent on teacher salaries and class materials . Although the school 's owners claimed 90 percent placement rates , a former financial aid officer recently testified that the real rate was closer to one or two in 10  --  and many of those successful graduates began their " careers " behind the night desk of Miami 's Motel 6 . All that for $43 million a year in federally guaranteed loans  --  a figure that amply covered the million-dollar salaries of the schools ' top two " deans . " <p> If that story scored a few local headlines , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although industry groups claim that 81 percent of trade school graduates find work in their fields , that healthy return disintegrates in other , more independent studies . A 1989 New York City government analysis reported that , despite ample federal aid , only 4 percent of disadvantaged trade school students were off the welfare rolls one year after their training . Even using the trade schools ' own unverified numbers , another study by Interface discovered that less than a quarter of enrollees eventually found jobs in their field of study . Several researchers concede that trade schools offer students short-term economic gains , but long-term prospects look less certain . Norton Grubb of Berkeley 's National Center for Research in Vocational Education recently completed the first long-term study of the sector . After 14 years , he found , trade school graduates showed no gain in income compared to people with basic high school diplomas . In fact , in some cases a trade school degree actually hurt income . <p> Behind those cold numbers , obviously , there 's an awful lot of human carnage . Stephanie Percy-Garrett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shelter for the Homeless , comes across more than her share every day . She remembers one well-groomed young graduate particularly well . The woman arrived at her interview on time , proudly bearing a diploma from PTC Career Institute , certifying her typing at 75+ wpm . " We said , great , fantastic . We should n't have any trouble placing her , " Percy-Garrett recalls . " But then we asked her to take our own test . She sat down , stared at the keyboard , and said , OK  --  do I have to type all the periods and commas , too ? ' " <p> " A few bad apples "  --  that 's been the trade schools ' standard response to distasteful reports like Percy-Garrett 's . But a mid-eighties General Accounting Office study of 1,600 schools counted up an orchard 's worth , charging that more than two-thirds of trade schools " misrepresented " their placement rates , curricula , or student aid . Today , a phalanx of Department of Education reformers tinkers in the margins with default rates , branch campuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes . What they 're not fussing with is far more fundamental : whether or not the graduate knows enough about periods and commas to get a job . <p> During the eighties , educational " outcomes "  --  not the money spent on classroom time , but the results of that classroom time  --  became the central criterion for evaluating America 's K-12 education . President Bush and dozens of governors now advocate tying teachers ' pay raises to test scores and other measurable results . Outcomes are even more relevant in the vocational sector , where students study specialized , technical trades . Yet proprietary schools have consistently resisted those standards . To qualify for federal aid under current regulations , a trade school may have to keep a neat file of student loan records , but it does n't have to prove it found its graduates a place in American business . <p> While that fact probably delights the owners of federally accredited broadcasting , bartending , and casino-dealing schools , it has discomfiting results in the marketplace . Last year , New York Telephone interviewed 57,000 applicants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where were all those potential electricians ? In beauty school . In 1990 , although New York government officials warned that the market was glutted , more city residents used federal funds to study nail sculpting and haircutting than any other vocational subject . <p> Even as civil rights and legal services advocates scream for radical trade school reform , trade school lobbyists raise the specter of inequity to protect the status quo . Hurt us , their argument goes , and you 're bound to hurt the poor . A spokesman for PTC Career Institute puts it coyly : " We 're a product of the population we serve . " Since that population tends to fail in great numbers , it 's unfair to penalize trade schools for trying to save a few . So fluent in the idiom of civil rights is the trade school lobby that one accrediting agency head recently compared a proposed reform to apartheid . The equity argument has had real currency in Congress over the years . It may have less in real life . <p> The Washington Urban League 's Information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Education , but its expectations for the poor are a world apart . The IBM PCs and low teacher-student ratios would undoubtedly pass federal muster , but in director Effie Smith-Macklin 's modest classrooms , what really stands out are the intangibles . Attendance mandatory . Achievement expected . No slack , no attitude allowed . Seven hours a day for six months , more than 80 students study " business English , " word processing , and other secretarial skills inside a grubby , 80-year-old school , stopping only to go to the bathroom and eat lunch . There 's no mauve , no paisley anywhere , but as Smith-Macklin tells her students , " This may be a raggedy building , but you decide what happens inside . " <p> For the Training Center 's students , the distinction between circumstance and possibility is apt , for virtually all of them fit the federal government 's none-too-lenient definition of disadvantaged . Several have been homeless ; most of the rest are what 's known as the hardcore unemployed . And quite a few of them , oddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . " These are people who have considerable loans , " clucks Smith-Macklin . " But they still are n't skilled enough to get a job . " After six months under her tutelage , though , more than 85 percent go off to work for IBM , Mobil , defense contractors , and law firms . <p> Of course , scores of trade schools claim numbers like Smith-Macklin 's . But unlike them , she has to back them up , because her program is funded by another federal program , the Job Training Partner ship Act ( JTPA ) . Inspired by the same market consciousness as the Department of Education 's trade school plan and committed to the same privatization of training , JTPA shows what federal money can accomplish when it 's tied firmly to results . <p> Serving tiny enclaves of disadvantaged youth , adults , displaced workers , Eskimos , and Indians across the country , JTPA makes for an unlikely vanguard . By contracting to the private sector , it trains workers at far less cost than even " market " schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government $4,000 per student . Tuition for a six-month course at a private trade school runs thousands of dollars more , for which more than 85 percent of students receive substantial federal aid . But that 's just money . More important , in the seven years since its inception , JTPA 's been surprisingly successful at training the poor to meet real labor needs . Every year , in every state , " private industry councils " made up of business executives , union officials , and community leaders decide what type of training is most needed in the community , using labor market information collected by state and local governments . Then community colleges , nonprofit agencies , public schools , businesses , and other institutions compete for contracts to train workers in those fields . <p> Though trade schools are eligible to compete for the $3 billion available through JTPA , most of them do n't bother to apply . Why ? Possibly because in most states at least 60 percent of adult JTPA graduates must find jobs at the end of their training ( figures verified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chunk of their money . When the high placement standards were first proposed , potential JTPA contractors raged , pointing to their clients and spouting culture-of-poverty rhetoric . Then surprise : they started hitting their targets . While states are free to lower their placement goals during recessions or a contractors ' revolt , few have done so . Massachusetts , South Carolina , and other states have actually raised theirs . <p> A success story ? Sort of . Today , JTPA operates on the margins , serving less than 5 percent of eligible disadvantaged adults , providing unsophisticated , short-term training , and watching its federal funding wither away . That 's a lethargy that trickles down to contractors less dogged than Effie Smith-Macklin . <p> Instead of serving the stigmatized few , the marketwise , outcome-oriented JTPA should be a model for all federal vocational education  --  and could easily be , with a sturdier commitment from Congress . But in the long run , there 's a level of accountability that even JTPA has n't tackled : training quality  --  a word that implies more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractors do what 's right for their clients , providing superior training that prepares them for decent jobs . It can , however , instigate quality control so convincing that the private sector will come running for graduates of federally funded programs . <p> To make that absurd proposition a probability , one has to look away from JTPA to Germany , which places a premium on intensive noncollege training . With the help of business , union , and education leaders , the German government has developed national competency exams for several hundred technical , manufacturing , and clerical vocations  --  which may be one reason Germany , with a quarter of our population , nearly equaled us last year in exports . While many of America 's " professional " licensing exams are a barely relevant barrier to entry ( passing the bar , for instance , qualifies you to try capital cases and close real estate deals without testing to see whether you can do either ) , by its nature , vocational education allows for practical testing . If you can demonstrate your ability to read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be a certified secretary . If you can run conduit , pull wire , and fathom the interplay between amps , volts , and watts , you can be an accredited entry-level electrician . And by extension , the feds should start a system under which , if you can successfully train those secretaries and electricians  --  whether you 're the PTC Career Institute or the Urban League  --  you can get federal funds . <p> Radical as national trade-testing sounds , its advocates here include three former labor secretaries , the CEOs of Eastman Kodak and Xerox , union heads , top officials of the New York State Department of Education , leading economists , and the nonprofit National Center on Education and the Economy . Developing equitable , sensible tests will be a challenge , no question . But the results will reverberate  --  not simply by weeding lousy schools from federal programs , but by ensuring the quality of nearly half of the U.S. workforce . Training our sights <p> The English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins , bouncing from job to wretched job , once confided his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locate that infinitesimal point where he and the world might intersect . As America slips into recession , helping 5 million members of the underclass find that nexus will be one of the federal government 's toughest jobs . So many people searching , so little coordination . As Xerox chairman David Kearns recently put it , " This has the makings of a national disaster . " Fortunately , as Congress reauthorizes the Higher Education Act this session , programs like JTPA offer the makings of a solution . <p> The chief argument against quality-controlled , market-conscious federal job training is money . It would be expensive . But real training is worth it , not just as a sop to the underclass , but as a boost to America 's rank in the new economic order . Our competitor nations recognized the connection between job competence and national economic health decades ago , which is why their training is partly funded by levies on those who directly benefit from the results : employers . Today , American companies spend far less than their Japanese , German , and Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our competitors champion skill mastery , we create more dead-end jobs . A training tax on business would force companies to carry their share of the burden . Add those revenues to the billions of dollars already squandered on grants and outstanding federal loans made to unemployable trade school graduates , and you can salvage a lot of wasted potential . <p> Reinventing America 's trade training will ultimately give American business a competent , competitive front line . But there 's something even more important involved here . In America , dreams like the ones Tommy Wayne Downs sold should n't have to be lies . Continuing to countenance a broken trade school system sends an ugly message to the poor : Some people  --  even those who work to beat the odds  --  are simply born to lose . <p> by Katherine Boo <p> <p> Katherine Boo is an editor of The Washington Monthly . <p>
