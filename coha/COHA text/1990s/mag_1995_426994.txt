LOOK ! IT 'S A COWARD ! IT 'S A CAD ! IT 'S . . . <p> After ten novels , Britain 's drinking , wenching Victorian military hero is still at it . Why do n't more Americans care ? <p> " When all other trusts fail , turn to Flashman . "  --  ABRAHAM LINCOLN <p> <p> Boys read different books than girls : this is why there are soldiers , and freebooters , and pirates , and empires . It is why Sherlock Holmes and James Bond and Tarzan have nothing to fear from posterity , for every man has deep within him a shadow self dreaming of impossibly heroic lives he might have led . <p> All the same , at the end of this weary century what we need is a hero we can believe in , a hero worse than most of us : a cad , a liar , a bounder , a coward , a lecher , a bully , a cheat , a rogue with no illusions about fighting on the side of the angels ; a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults excuse our own . And naturally , he should always get the gifts . <p> Any scoundrel should be allowed to introduce himself : <p> " For a well-decorated hero I 've done a deal of surrendering in my time  --  which is doubtless why I remain a well-decorated hero . . . if there 's one thing I 've learned . . . it 's that the foeman is generally as glad to accept your surrender as you are to give it . Mind you , he may turn spiteful later , when he 's got you snug and helpless ( I often do ) , but that 's a risk you must run . . . . <p> In 1969 a novel appeared in England to great accolades  --  P.G . Wodehouse remarked , " If ever there was a time when I felt that **38;1534;TOOLONG stuff , it was when I read the first Flashman . " The novel , by a Scots newspaperman named George MacDonald Fraser , purported to be the first packet from a recently discovered trunk of oilskin-wrapped memoirs of a Victorian military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics recognized Flashman as a brilliant literary conceit , for the character appeared as a boy in Thomas Hughes ' Tom Brown 's Schooldays ( 1857 ) . He 's the drunken bully who 's expelled from Rugby , rendering the rest of the work dull by his absence . <p> Flashman begins where Hughes left off , but the brute tells the tale himself . In swift order ( 1839-42 ) our man Flashy has seduced his father 's mistress , joined the cavalry , been the target of a shotgun marriage , cheated in a duel , learned Hindustani from an Indian slave-wench , ridden alongside the toughest warrior-horsemen in Central Asia , and come through the First Afghan Wars as the hero of the fearful siege of Jallalabad , the only white man left breathing in the rubble  --  through his own relentless survival instinct ( he calls it cowardice ) . <p> What made it all intoxicating was not just the humor , or the vivid prose and period slang , but the tone  --  praising and damning the British Empire while being pelted with its medals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparing no foreign barbarians either . <p> On our own drowsy shores the novel was taken by many at face value ; a gleeful New York Times article pointed out how credulous reviewers  --  a third out of some 30-odd  --  read it as authentic autobiography . ( " The most important discovery since the Boswell papers , " said one . ) Flashman was born , and now , a quarter century later , with the tenth volume in bookstores ( Flashman And The Angel Of The Lord , 1858-9 , in which Flash winds up quaking beside John Brown at Harper 's Ferry ) , the saga is far from over . <p> The novels are theoretically memoirs , written in Flashman 's old age . In fact they are history with the gloves off , as Fraser  --  an unsentimental ex-soldier with a scholar 's exhaustive sweep , a journalist 's nose for detail and a superb comic instinct  --  roams through the confused pageant of the previous century on a **26;1574;TOOLONG Grand Tour . Flashman is never running too fast to analyze what went wrong on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amazed regard for the true heroes he meets , who frighten him . And the more a poltroon Flashman seems , the more trustworthy a narrator he becomes , since only an honest man would present himself so unflatteringly . A man with no illusions about himself : it may be Flashman 's only real virtue . <p> All Flashman truly wants is to be safe in England , spending his wife 's money drinking or wenching . But after Afghanistan , his military superiors and the English public regard him as a valiant hero and send him once more into the breach . Amid an unexpected liaison with Lola Montez he is kidnapped to Germany by Otto yon Bismarck , there to impersonate an imprisoned prince ( RoyalFlash , 1842-3 &; 1847-8 ) . With customary misfortune he soon finds himself first chief of staff to the White Raja , Brooke of Sarawak , and then gets sold as slave , " military adviser and chief stud to a black she-devil "  --  Queen Ranavalona of Madagascar ( Flashman 's Lady , 1842-5 ) . In the Punjab he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And The Mountain Of Light , 1845-6 ) but manages to charm a nymphomaniacal Maharani and pocket the Kohi-Noor diamond . He is by turns a reluctant slaver in West Africa  --  shanghaied by a Latin-quoting , failed classics scholar across the Middle Passage and a fugitive abolitionist agent in the U.S. ( Flash For Freedom , 1848-9 ) . He escorts a bordello by wagon across the Great Plains as a Forty-Niner and years later ends up as the sole " fleeing survivor " alongside Custer at the Little Big Horn ( Flashman and The Redskins , 1849-50 &; 1875-6 ) . <p> Sent against his protestations to the Crimea , Flash becomes " unwilling leader of the Light Brigade " ( Flashman At The Charge , 1854-5 ) , farting so loudly his frightened horse plunges him in the wrong direction , straight at the guns . In India he 's a hapless hero in the Mutiny ( Flashman In The Great Game , 1856-8 ) . In China it 's the 1860 Rebellion ( Flashman And The Dragon , 1860 ) , running guns and opium and servicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to reach home unscathed . <p> Much of his time is spent escaping perilous women . " There 's a test which I apply to all my old flames , when I think back . . . if she 'd been mine to sell , how long would I have kept her ? " His geographically diverse list includes Lily Langtry , Duchess Irma of Russia , Takes-Away-Clouds-Woman of the Apaches , Ko Dali 's daughter the Silk One , Mrs. Mandeville the Mad Dwarf , and the dancing-girl Narreeman . There 's Yehonala Tzuhsi , concubine of the Manchoo Emperor , the Indian mutineer Lakshmibai ; and Lola Montez . ( " An empress , a queen , and the greatest courtesan of her time ; I dare say I 'm just a snob . " ) <p> He does the deed in a remarkable array of locales : in a Chinese oven , during a battle with Borneo pirates , on furs in a sleigh escaping pursuit on the Russian steppe . He never questions his magnetism to women ( " I could see she fancied me ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alike " ) , but Fraser 's deftest irony is that Flashman 's feather-brained , golden-haired , beloved wife Elspeth is probably  --  certainly  --  happily cheating on him too . No wonder : he 's rarely home . <p> And Flashman does gain wisdom . " There 's nothing so cheering as surviving a peril in which companions have perished . . . There is great pleasure in catastrophe that does n't touch you , and anyone who says there is n't is a liar . " He sees firsthand how " the course of history is a soften settled by someone 's having a belly-ache , or not sleeping well , or a sailor getting drunk , or some aristocratic harlot waggling her backside . " He learns how to look brave ( " head up , jaw firm , eyes steady , bowels dissolving " ) . And ever open-minded , he knows " the heathen creeds , for all their nonsensical mumbo-jumbo , were as good as any for keeping the rabble in order , and what else is religion for ? " <p> If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as Stevenson or Graham Greene  --  the Literary Establishment could dismiss them as mere entertainments . But there is something deeper , a peculiarly autumnal feeling as the old charlatan ranges back in memory across a world long gone . ( If he has a literary predecessor , it is probably Falstaff . ) Flash is the antithesis of a 007 or a Holmes Or a Horatio Hornblower , ever stalwart for England . Ever terrified , Flashy shares only one talent with the traditional British champion : a gift for foreign tongues and native disguise . <p> A natural comparison is with the Patrick O'Brian nautical novels , set around the Napoleonic Wars and lately a marketing phenomenon . With both you can learn a lot of history while having a rollicking time , but the approach is different . With Flashman you learn a lot about events , participating with him in major battles or political intrigues . The events in O'Brian , however , are peripheral ; instead you 're learning the social mores on land and sea , the flora and fauna , how people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no real comedy but rather a parlor wit , and the sex is understated , offstage . O'Brian is benefitting from our unusually nostalgic era , in which the mores of another time seem more satisfying than our own , and his books have echoes of a search for heroes and family values . Fraser 's Flashman simply does n't fit comfortably into any of this and , exploding the myths of that nostalgic past on every page , is knottier to deal with . <p> Here is Mashman on Scud East , a junior classmate he bullied at Rugby whom he later sees murdered in the Indian Mutiny . It is a revealing event : Flash calls Scud one of Rugby 's " sturdy fools , manly little chaps . . . full of virtue , the kind that schoolmasters love . Yes , he was a fool then , and a fool twenty years later , when he died in the dust at Cawnpore with a Sepoy 's bayonet in his back . Honest Scud East ; that was all his gallant goodness did for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bastard , man and boy , for his smug manly piety  --  but you do n't see a child you 've known all your life die every day . Maybe that was why I wept . . . I felt it all the more sincerely for knowing that I was still alive myself . " We are a long way from Holmes and Hornblower here : the jingoistic historical fantasy of England is finished . <p> One strong echo is of Fraser himself . In 1992 he published his own war memoirs , Quartered Safe Out Here , from his guerrilla experiences in Burma in 1945 at age 19 . The similarity of Fraser 's voice and tone to Flash 's is evident . In it , almost as a statement of purpose , Fraser writes , " You can not , you must not , judge the past by the present ; you must try to see it in its own terms and values , if you are to have any inkling of it . " <p> After Burma , Fraser trained as an officer in India and earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1947 . He became a reporter for a small paper in northern England , married a reporter on a rival paper , and went to the Glasgow Herald in ' 53 . After 16 years as deputy editor , he quit just after the first Flashman debuted , to great success ( " written in a few weeks , turned down by every publisher for three years " ) . <p> " I was always telling stories , " he says . " I used to tell bedtime stories to my parents rather than the other way around . " He began the second Flashman just before the first appeared . " I did n't envisage more than three or four . Now they 've been translated into every language in Western Europe except Greek . " In Who 's Who , as a recreation he lists " talking to my wife . " <p> Apart from ten Flashmans and the Burma memoir , Fraser has written seven other books , mostly fiction ; among them is The Hollywood History Of The World , a survey of the cinema 's accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screenwriter , too  --  he did one Bond film , Octopussy , Force 10 From Navarone and fine versions of The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers with Oliver Reed , Michael York and Faye Dunaway . <p> As the memoirs ' editor ( a nice conceit ) , Fraser finds Flashy remarkably accurate , with rare slips of detail ; the " editor 's " copious footnotes and appendices at the end of each meticulously researched volume add greatly to the illusion . Fraser , who lives on the Isle of Man , is a tireless researcher . " I get the facts , consider the course of a campaign , and try to fit Flashman into it . History itself does the work . The difficulty in dealing with a 19th-century character is it takes so long to get him from point A to point B. For example , with the most recent book I was faced with the difficulty of getting Flashman from India at the end of the Mutiny to the States in time for Harper 's Ferry . " <p> One of the books ' pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life with flesh-and-blood candor . They 're all here : " cocky little " Disraeli " well into greasy middle age . " Congressman Lincoln had " the makings of as big a scoundrel as I am myself , but his appetites were different . " G. B. Shaw advances " the fatuous opinion that mental anguish was worse than physical . " The incomprehensible barbarians also come to life : Goolab Singh , Yakub Beg , Hsien Feng . Flashman even teaches the young Crazy Horse how to wink . <p> It is hard to say why the books ( all ten in print ) have n't quite achieved best-seller-dom here , as they have in Britain  --  though Fraser 's U.S. audience is extremely avid and loyal . ( A witty 1975 film , RoyalFlash , with a screenplay by Fraser , starring Malcolm McDowell , has yet to appear here on video . ) It may be that we have neither the British historical sense nor their self-scrutiny , though we have no shortage of famous scoundrels . Or it may be that 19th-century India , China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ java . <p> Still , I know one prominent historian who counts Flashman 's misadventures with the Sioux and Apaches as the single finest historical novel of the Wild West . Here 's how Flash puts it , having been scalped : " You see , it 's been the great illusion of our civilization that when the poor heathen saw our steamships and elections and drains and bottled beer , he 'd realize what a benighted ass he 'd been and come into the fold . But he do n't . Oh , he 'll take what he fancies , and can use ( cheap booze and rifles , for example ) but not on that account will he think we 're better . He knows different . . . And it does n't help when the two sides regard each other respectively as greedy , brutal white thieves and beastly , treacherous red vermin . I 'm not saying either was wrong . " <p> What gives the books more torque than the very finest genre writing they apparently resemble ? It 's partly that beneath that inspired voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books remain remarkably even-handed and difficult to place politically . Fraser is a severe critic of empire as well as an admirer ; Flashman has no illusions about so-called civilized Englishmen being any better morally than wild Apaches or Tajiks or mutinous Indian Sepoys . And as novels of war they are unromantic , probably because Fraser 's own hand-to-hand battle experience resembled a 19th-century conflict . <p> Thus Flashman has no patience with the preachiness that surrounds war . With him there can be no soapbox illusions or sham moralizing . It 's no surprise that Fraser calls the Victorians " mere amateurs in hypocrisy compared to our own brainwashed , sanctimonious , self-censoring and terrified generation . " He adds , " One review from the States pointed out that Flashman is politically incorrect  --  absolutely true , I 'm glad to say . " <p> And what next ? Fraser promises more Flashmans , and at age 70 he seems to be going strong . He has completed a novelette , Flashman And The Tiger , which takes place in South Africa and England and may grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recounting Flashman 's role in the Civil War , purportedly fighting for both sides . Meanwhile , some readers refuse to accept that Flashman was n't an actual personage  --  or at least go along with Fraser 's game . " Often people write me to say they 're descendants of his  --  so I write back and congratulate them . And a few correspondents even claim that Flashman borrowed $50 from their grandfather and would I. . . ? Then I reply that I simply ca n't assume his debts .
