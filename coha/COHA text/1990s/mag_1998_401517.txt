Miss Sally 's room at the Hardie School simply buzzed with excitement ! Even the boys were interested , although this affair belonged strictly to the girls . " I 'm going to get out my Clementina . She has a whole trunk full of clothes , " Lily Motts giggled with excitement . " Maybe my mother 'd lend a funny straw doll we bought in Kansas last summer when we were driving out there , " Billy Davis spoke importantly . " He 's all straw , face and everything . Got a regular farmer 's straw hat . But he 's awfully cute . " Abigail Penny 's heart fairly thumped with the thrill of it all . A doll show ! It would be beautiful . How glad she was that she was here in this new school , not back on the bleak prairie . But she did miss Black Hawk , her shining pony , and the long , long rides . Margaret Grant , the minister 's daughter , was speaking . " I know I can bring my Turkish doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . Abigail Penny had seen that doll . He sat on the edge of a bookcase in the Grants ' living room . He was dressed in a purple satin suit , with a red fez on his head , like any Turkish gentleman . It would be a beautiful show , with everyone helping . " I-have a doll , " Astrid Anderson 's words came slowly . " She is not yet dressed . Perhaps my mother-if you would like-would dress her in the old costume-of the old country-Sweden . She has long blond braids . " The little group interrupted her with cries of pleasure . Margaret Grant gave a little pull to one of Astrid 's own long yellow braids . Then she turned to smile at Abigail Penny . " Did you bring a prairie doll back with you ? " Abigail Penny felt her face stiffen . But the final bell saved her from answering . Miss Sally 's room listened attentively while Miss Sally read the Twenty-third Psalm , and then the pupils joined her in the Lord 's Prayer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent . She did have a prairie doll . It was a wooden creature , battered , old-fashioned , with a funny , round , wooden head , staring black eyes , carved black-painted mouth , pink cheeks , and stiff wooden body . Even her name was old-fashioned-Lavina . Abigail Penny 's eyes all but filled with tears . She loved Lavina , homely and old-fashioned as she was . But she could never bring her to a doll show . Everyone would laugh , and she could n't stand that . Yet she must do something for the doll show . Poor Lavina was on her mind all through history , geography , nature study , and algebra . For the doll show was not a play affair . There was a real purpose behind it . The Hardie School was brand-new , and in order to have a cafeteria , it needed more money than the amount appropriated by the town . Because the town was heavily taxed already , all the town organizations had been helping to raise money . The Parent Teacher Association , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the Hardie School 's turn to do something for itself , for everyone wanted the white-tiled cafeteria , with its electric ranges , glittering ice boxes , and gleaming copper pots . The boys had been making things down in the shop-garden tools , gaily painted red and green ; smooth-polished skis for snow-covered hills ; and bookends , boats , and other lovely things . And they were still taking orders and making good money . Miss Ada 's pupils were cooking-muffins , cakes , and gingerbread . They took orders , too . Miss Ernestine 's room sold sandwiches at recess , and Miss Mabel 's sold fruit . Now Miss Sally 's room was to have a doll show , and charge admission . They would hold it in the evening , just like grown-ups . That afternoon , Abigail Penny set Lavina on a chair before her and looked at her long and earnestly . There was no way out of it . Lavina was unlike all the other dolls . She was n't pretty and dainty like Clementina ; she was n't fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Billy Davis ' straw man . She was just-old-fashioned . Abigail Penny took Lavina in her arms and rocked her gently to and fro for a long time . She would not show Lavina . That was settled . No one should ever laugh at her . Perhaps Margaret Grant would forget to ask her again . But Margaret Grant did not forget . " Did you say you had a prairie doll ? " It was early . There was no bell to save Abigail this time . " Yes-yes-a kind of prairie doll , I guess . " " Can you bring her ? " Margaret Grant was always practical . " Why-why , you see , she's-old-fashioned- " " Just what we want . We have n't a single oldfashioned one yet . They are all just lovely . An oldfashioned prairie doll . " Margaret Grant smiled and patted Abigail 's shoulder . She did not notice that Abigail gave her no answering smile . Old-fashioned prairie doll ? The only old-fashioned one yet ! Lavina had seen blizzards and swollen rivers , Indians and wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had belonged to Great-great-grandmother , who had almost lost Lavina in the swollen Little Sioux River . And the man who had married Great-great-grandmother had rescued her . And now people would laugh at her . Abigail Penny 's fists clenched . She would never show Lavina with those other dolls ! Miss Sally was speaking . " Our doll show promises to be a huge success . Now if every single one of you does his or her very best to help out- whywe 're going to have our cafeteria ! " His or her very best ! Lavina ? Abigail Penny felt like a traitor . Haltingly she explained to her mother that Lavina must be part of the doll show . " You might dress her up in her Revolutionary clothes , " said her mother . She opened a drawer of an old chest in the corner of the living room and took out a little brass-studded trunk . The opened lid showed a cloth-like lining printed in soft , old red . " Great-greatgrandmother 's , " said Abigail , as one recites a poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And she drew out a dress . Pale apple green it was , of silk so ribbed and heavy that it stood alone , without Lavina in it . The tiny panniers were of cream-colored silk , deep ivory now , covered with rose sprigs , and the tight-fitting waist was of the same material . A soft scarf , or fichu , of lace was deep yellow with age , and best of all , there were exquisitely knit silk mitts to pull on Lavinas stiff arms . " I 'd almost forgotten Greatgreat-grandmother . You 'd never let me have the dress to play with , " said Abigail . Lovingly she dressed Lavina and then stared long at her , for somehow Lavina did not look old-fashioned . She lookedright . That was the word . She looked as if she belonged-the dress to Lavina-Lavina to the dress . Abigail felt comforted . Perhaps no one would laugh now . Lavina might be different , but she was almost-beautiful . Plans for the doll show grew and grew . Each doll was to have its own booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doll desired . Lavina brought her brass-studded trunk with her , and a quilt . It was of the same soft cloth , redprinted , with boats and a little flowing river , trees , and a little mill , that lined the trunk . And all over the quilt were miracles of tiny stitchery , even and exquisite . // Somehow , when Lavina was placed , with the light glinting on the brass studding , on the old red print , and on her soft green dress , she looked stunning n't giggle once . Each doll had its story typed and tacked on the booth beside her . So Abigail had worked faithfully over the story she had written , determined to do her very best for Lavina . The doll show was a very festive occasion . The whole town turned out . The principal of the Hardie School made a speech . The school orchestra played . The Boys ' Glee Club sang some very merry songs . And there were the dolls in all their glory . The people looked at the dolls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories . But always the crowd seemed thickest about Lavina . Abigail Penny hovered in the distance , her fingers curled tightly into the palms of her hands , her ears strained . But no one laughed . // Now it just happened that the Hardie School was near a famous inn . It was famous in history , in poetry , and now it had become famous as the fulfillment of a famous rich man 's dream . And the rich man came to the doll show . How the hall did buzz , for the whole world seemed to know of him ! It was almost over now . Abigail 's fingers began to uncurl . Soon she could take Lavina home . But the man was talking to the principal and to Abigail 's mother . The principal bowed politely , but Abigail 's mother shook her head . And now the famous man was going to make a speech . He was taking Lavina in his hands ! Abigail Penny held her breath . " My friends and neighbors , " the man began . A stillness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the voice of the famous man , as he read the story of Lavina out loud . " My great-greatgrandmother , Abigail Deane , was only sixteen when she married my great-great-grandfather . They moved to Ohio , from right here . She took the little trunk and Lavina with her . I think she must have loved her very much . An Indian stole Lavina and my greatgreat-grandmother cried . His little girl was sick , but when he showed her Lavina she smiled and grew better . So he brought Lavina back , with some corn for the horses . Great-great-grandmother made this quilt out of some of the cloth they used to wrap up the pewter in the wagon , and she lined the trunk . " My great-great-grandmother went to Iowa in a covered wagon . She took Lavina with her , because she had always played with her as a little girl . I expect it made her feel better about leaving her mother . I expect they both cried . But Lavina did n't cry , not even when she fell into the Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all downstream . And Greatgreat-grandfather had to swim after Lavina . I guess it was lucky she was wood . " Great-greatgrandmother moved to South Dakota . This is when Lavina learned to ride . For Great-greatgrandmother and Great-great-grandfather rode all the way . So did Lavina , most of the time . When they were nearing Black Pine Fork , they were chased by a band of Indians on the warpath . Even the wagons had to gallop to try to reach the fort on the Black Pine . Then Great-great-grandmother dropped Lavina . And she turned her horse-his name was Black Hawk , and I named my pony after him-and she rode right back toward the Indians . They thought it was a trick . They were so surprised they slowed and turned . Great-great-grandmother leaned out of her saddle and picked up Lavina . Eventually , they all got to the fort safely . " Lavina still likes to ride . My uncle is going to send me my pony , Black Hawk , now that we are settled . Then we can ride again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would n't have , only Miss Sally wanted us all to help . So Lavina has on the dress Greatgreat-grandmother Abigail Deane took West with her to remind her of the East-and home . She had one just like it . But there was n't room to take that . So she made a copy for Lavina . And that 's Lavina 's story . " The famous man had to wait till the applause died down . How everyone did dap ! Abigail Penny wondered why her eyes smarted with tears . She was happy . They were clapping for Lavina , not laughing . // Then the famous man began to speak again . Again the hall quieted . " I had hoped perhaps Lavina might come to live with us at the inn . She would find there so many things that she once knewpewter dishes , brick ovens , long-handled spoons and pans for the open fires , little pewter lamps , Betty lamps to clamp on your chair and read by whale oil light , and many other things . " But I realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its traditions and cherishes its symbols . So I 'm hoping Lavina will come to visit the inn-say on Sundays-and bring her trunk with her . And if her owner , Abigail Deane Penny , will let her come , I shall be glad to contribute to the Hardie Cafeteria . " And he named a sum which meant that the cafeteria , from the biggest electric stove down to the tiniest knife , with its bright winking blade , should come true . Lavina had done it ! Lavina ! Somehow Abigail Penny stumbled forward amid the excited applause . But she did not forget to curtsy properly to the principal and the famous man , for Abigail Penny belonged to a family which cherished its traditions . // <p>
