Jack Cady 's novella , " The Night We Buried Road Dog , " ( January , 1993 ) , was one of the most talked-about stories of that year . It was reprinted several times and is considered a classic already . This should not surprise readers already familiar with Jack 's novels , such as the well-received Street from St. Martin 's Press . Jack is one of the strongest , most original voices in our field . <p> Now he returns to our pages with another novella . " Kilroy Was Here " finds adventure in the most unlikely setting , and heroics among the most unlikely heroes . Beneath it all is a story of courage so powerful it will surely break your heart , just as it broke ours . <p> He dreamed his feet were so cold that he ran to the battalion aid station , and there were his mother and sister fixing him some hot food over a wood fire , and poking up the fire so he could warm his feet . But before he could eat the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet were still cold . <p> Ernie Pyle  --  Brave Men I The V.A . Hospital Sits solemn and grand above this too busy northwest city where traffic rumbles and rain mostly pours . Darkness lies between this place and the city , a darkness we 've but noticed lately . I totter at a red hot half-a-mile an hour along lighted halls and Burnside generally outruns me . Burnside drives a wheelchair and his motto is , " Leave no nurse 's butt unpatted , " because , as he says , " Waste is a sin and I 'm practicin ' to be a preacher . " <p> And this V.A . hospital , itself , is no bad place for a Burnside type of ministry . The hospital stands like a temple , and through its halls and secret passages and operating rooms eternally pour shapes of human hope and pain ; shapes of mystery , dread , high times and low . People stride or tippy-toe or cakewalk these halls depending on who 's got what share of joy or trouble , and where that trouble lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " It ai n't altogether a noble occupation , Ross , but it 's three hots and a flop . It is , by God , a livin ' . " <p> " It 's a dying , " I tell him . " It 's the jump-off place where the world takes its last Shot , and Sarge , the world is gon na win . " When you talk to Burnside you have to mix good sense with a touch of facts or he wo n't understand . Burnside has flung b.s. for seventy-six of his seventy-eight years , having been somewhat slow as a baby . <p> He rolls that wheelchair like a Hell 's Angel of the geriatric ward ; a wheelchair with racing stripes , a foxtail , an ooga-ooga horn , and the remnants of a Japanese battle flag fluttering from a stick of the kind you see on bicycles . Burnside has arms and shoulders like a dwarfed goliath , and legs so thin his small feet look like powderpuffs attached to toothpicks . " It 's a real adventure being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You learn to crap in a lotta new ways . " Burnside has about three red hairs remaining along each temple , his dome is bald , his mustache gray , and hair sprouting from his ears approaches maroon . <p> The kind thing would be to let him pass away in silence , and the smart thing would be to pass away myself ; but days stretch long when the brain is good and the body is shot  --  and for too long , maybe , we 've been silent . My hands no longer hold a pen , but thanks to the mysterious East I have a tape recorder that works . My hips almost do n't work . I 've got hips like cracked glass . <p> My tape recorder purrs like a Japanese cat as I tell about what happens , or has happened , and as I concentrate on Burnside . Burnside was okay until , some years ago , he bounced a Honda Goldwing off a phone pole and into a lady 's petunia patch . She stood wailing over bruised petunias . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a busted pelvis , taking advantage of the situation in an attempt to lure her into the sack . <p> Other people around here are lucky , maybe . They fester in a vegetable state . They 've disconnected from the world , have dreamed their ways into the past , and become ghosts who sit before the dayroom TV ; listening to chatter , patter , gossip , and lisping cartoons . The TV spooks are more ghostly than the real ghosts who plague this hospital . This place is a ghost factory . <p> It was the real ghosts who started things . We lifers were peaceful enough telling lies about our different wars , and about our lives in and out of the military . We were happy checking obituaries each day , and chortling over the passing of generals and presidents . " The main difference between dead and alive , " says Burnside , " is that ' dead ' means off the payroll . " <p> Then the ghosts got into it . They generally hang around the cemetery out back with its brightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or under beds . They wisp their ways through these halls , rolling along silent as the soft paws of dust kittens . The orderlies do n't see them . The nurses do n't see them . We can hardly see them . <p> " It 's a perfect set-up , " Burnside says . " Plenty of company , cafeteria , television , bed , and a cemetery right at hand . " Then he tells a Burnside-type of story . Once , in the days after he retired from the Infantry , he worked as a groundskeeper in a corpse-farm called Rest Eternal . " They had amazin ' discounts for employees , " he tells anyone who will listen . " I was losin ' money every day I stayed alive . " <p> But stories about Burnside 's past did n't amount to a pastel damn once the present took over . The ghosts in this geriatric ward began manifesting . We did n't know what was happening at first . We did know our ranks were thinning . . . around here the ranks are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened up as Sgts . Smith and Sanders passed to the great beyond . Their empty chairs in the dayroom quickly filled with a couple of retired Marines still dumb enough to believe they were assigned to temporary duty . Plus , another bed was knocking on empty . The door to Corporal Harvey 's room stayed closed . Nurses came and went , came and went . Doctors avoided the place . All signs read " Farewell , Dan Harvey . " <p> Darkness started to roll along the hallways , and darkness clustered in the geriatric ward . The dayroom clouded , became blue like a 1940 's bar filled with jazz and tobacco smoke . A clarinet wailed as the TV ceased its quack and faded without a flicker . Darkness fell in individual rooms and squelched the common sounds of people puking , or gasping and sucking for breath , or wimpering as pain pills wore off . <p> Not a mother 's son or daughter in that dayroom missed a thing , although nurses kept scampering back and forth , back and forth , unseeing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so solid you could see them . The men wore ' 40 's uniforms , and the women looked like Greta Garbo , except more fun ; American , English , other kinds , mostly oriental . Some of the gals wore uniforms , most wore dresses . The clarinet wailed like the love-ridden and lonesome voice of a transport leaving dock , the voice behind final waves , final goodbyes . The clarinet talked about Lili Marlene , and in the background a trombone sobbed . The ghosts seemed to be trying to tell us something . A sailor ghost flagged semaphore ; colored flags whipping around the alphabet , but the only man on the ward who knew how to read it was a blind quartermaster , so that was a loss . <p> The halls became bluer , smokier , like lukewarm passions in the dusk of an old man 's mind . Chill air moved through the halls , and the door tO Corporal Harvey 's room opened . A nurse stepped through the doorway , her shoulders slumped , her hair astray , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . <p> " Janet , " Burnside said in an abstract and irrelevant way that for the moment held no b.s . " Susan . Yukiko san . The girls we left behind . " He watched another dejected nurse leave Corporal Harvey 's room . " That poor sumbitch is so dead , " he muttered , " that he really ought to go on sick call . " <p> We sat blinking . No one here ever thought of ghosts as more than shadows or memories , fragments of aged imaginations . The past adds up as men age , and remembered voices come from everywhere . Now it seemed there was more to it . I thought of reasons for being in a haunted place . I thought of history , of how things begin . <p> We credit tuberculosis with the building of this hospital . In the early parts of the century the " tee bees " took lives in breathless manners as lungs turned to shreds of dangling tissue , as lesions and excrescence sought out final gasps behind lips stained with choked-up blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That score goes to cholera ; but unlike cholera , t.b . spelled equal opportunity . It killed schoolteachers and bankers and captains of industry . <p> Our government , being enlightened , warehoused victims instead of shooting . It built hospitals in remote places . This hospital towers on a long hill overlooking a city that was once a place of neighborhoods if not a city of light . The hospital is thus downwind from prevailing weather patterns . The hospital is rage , serving as a landmark for airplanes , and even a landmark for ships cruising Puget Sound . Its outside displays yellow brick , and its inside glows mental-ward green . <p> By 1940 the docs found ways to beat tuberculosis . Some hospitals closed for lack of customers . Then , as Burnside points out , the happiest circumstance occurred . World War II arrived and spelled a blessing for the medics . " Gave them something to do , " Burnside says . " Kept ' em off the streets and out of jail . I never heard of a single doc who got ragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital resurrected , first under the military , then under the V.A . Spirits whirled , like in a Waring blender . On the west coast most casualties came from the South Pacific , although a lot of freeze and burn cases came from that snafu in the Aleutians . Men died in colorful ways , or were launched to new adventures from the ORs ; adventures in learning to walk without legs , work without hands , see without eyes  --  adventures in sipping beer through a straw when too sad and drunk to pick a glass up with a G.I. prosthesis . Brain cages cooked like french fries as electricity zapped , shock therapy being a hobby with the best medical minds of the day . A grateful nation , loving its loyal sons , did its damndest to sweep the warped remnants of men under the shaggy shagrug of history . <p> Fortunately for the hospital , as Burnside points out , the country discovered a conscience . " War saves people from themselves , " Burnside says , " and we found how to save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The hospital did not finish sweeping up WWII before Korea vets began to hurt , and Korea did not get swept up even after VietNam . Around here , docs still sweep , and nurses slump with fatigue and failure when another soul goes west . <p> What with soldiers and sailors and jarhead marines , it is no surprise this hospital seems loaded with ghosts . I say " loaded " and not " haunted " because until Corporal Harvey checked out , the ghosts saw us the same way we saw them , which is to say , insubstantial . Ghosts did n't give a hang for us , nor did they give a fat rat 's behind . And we did n't think they were any too loveable . <p> I sat , still blinking , and thinking of history and ghosts and blue light and 1940 's bars , of transports and tears . Our ghosts had just held a real shindig , then disappeared . The ghost waving semaphore was last to leave . <p> " Sarge , " I said to Burnside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I eased into a chair in the dayroom , sitting among TV stiffs , and looked around . Twenty old soldiers parked there , including a couple of Wacs . . . during WWII one of those kids helped run an ops center in jolly old Liverpool , the other did time in a supply room in Norfolk . There are not many women in V.A . geriatric wards . We only have these two . <p> Now the Wacs nudged the guys beside them , and the gals made dry-throat giggles of the kind that say , " catch me if you can . " Tallulah Bankhead had nothing on these kids , and who would 've ever suspected ? <p> " Ross , old buddy , that 's amazin ' . " Burnside watched the women , watched the surprised but suddenly interested men . " If that 's the best they can do , okay . I 've got my sights a few clicks higher . " <p> " No b.s. , " I told him . " What was all of that about ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue light , nobody waving semaphore or goodbye . The door to Corporal Harvey 's room remained closed . Come lights-out orderlies would steal in with a gurney , play body-snatcher , and by dawn 's early light Corporal Harvey would become a fading memory . This hospital never snatches corpses in broad daylight . It depresses the troops . <p> " I ca n't figure it . If the corporal 's on the far side , why is the far side waving goodbye ? Makes me right uneasy . " Burnside popped a wheelie . The wheelchair rayed like a pony with ambition , then hit the floor as Burnside spun in a circle . He would catch fire-breathing hell if any nurse saw that wheelie . Staff does not like wheelies . Wheelies mark the deck , cause scuff marks the buffers almost ca n't erase , and wheelies are traces of rebellion by patients . <p> Plus everyone would know it was Burnside 's wheelie . He 's the only one of the wheelchair bunch strong enough to pop a good one . He spun the chair in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A snort before lunch , and a snooze after . " He pointed the chair toward his room . <p> " It 's the solitary drinkers who end up doing time , " I told him . " You should n't drink alone . " I followed Burnside , and I followed slow . On good days I can make it through these hallways leaning on a cane . Most days I chase a walker . This place is  --  this place . If we did not have bullshit , we 'd be dead . Let me explain . <p> Pain around here is real . Around here bodies do not heal , and exercise does not work out stiffness . Doctors can mask some serious pain with pills , and people can hide from pain a little bit by using sedatives and drugged sleep . Pain here is eternal , like sunrise and sunset . It 's a part of conditions , part of a deal which says : if you live long enough , you have to hurt . <p> In this place puke is nasty , sour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along raw throats from guts that can no longer work a full shift . Puke comes laden with blood . In this place hip bones are so fragile one dares not stumble , and people who fall out of bed do not survive . When one is very , very old skin becomes thin as tissue paper , and cartilage around the nose disappears , causing it to retract . The face looks like a skull with skin . <p> This is human stuff ; the human thing we do not like to think about , not even when it 's happening . Sooner or later , though , it comes to a lot of us . The only people who are young forever are the ones who early-on have the bad luck to get in the way of bullets or trucks or killing disease . The message in this place says : you were n't smart enough to die young , so get it figured out . <p> Some people do n't figure . They become TV stiffs , and TV sucks them into its own darkness . Some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bullshit is the first line of defense against pain , or , as Burnside says of Corporal Harvey  --  " All that poor bastard had was cancer . I 've got cancer and a Combat Infantryman 's Badge . " <p> " You 've only got the prostate kind , " I tell him , " and Harvey had it in the gizzard . Prostate comes from frigging around with preacher 's wives . Anybody can get it . " <p> The first line of defense against pain . . . the other secret about pain is that it 's easier to handle if you do n't feel sorry for yourself . Burnside and I , and most of these geriatrics , learned about not feeling sorry for yourself during grade school . Of course , all of that happened some years ago . The reasons for our learning are now in history books . As Casey Stengle used to say , " You could look it up . " <p> So I followed Burnside as he headed for our room . We bunk two to a room in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they move us into solitary . As I followed I looked forward to a jolt of bourbon , either Burnside 's bourbon or mine . Burnside could find whiskey in the middle of the Sahara , and I could find the beer chaser . <p> Our stash hides in what used to be a dumbwaiter . This hospital has been redesigned so many times even architects lose track of how everything fits . At one time or other dumbwaiters were plastered over . We opened this one , flushed plaster piece-at-a-time down the latrine , and I hung battalion colors of the 120th Engineers over the hole . The 120th is not my outfit anyway , and screw the 120th . <p> " That was one swell party . Harvey must of meant something to somebody . " Burnside uncorked the Jim Beam . We were both having a tough time because of Harvey . Dan Harvey had been a good friend . <p> " I always thought those ghosties were just part of your imagination , " Burnside said . " Ross , you 're getting elderly . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a little sip and passed the bottle . I took it from him just in time to keep it from getting dropped . Burnside looked up , fumbled , saw something standing behind my shoulder . His face went white as a corpse . Then his mouth twitched , and his hands dropped to the wheels of the chair like he was ready to lead a charge . " What are you doing here ? " he whispered , and for the second time in a single day his voice held no b.s . He looked at me . " You 'll want to take a lick outta that bottle before you turn around . " <p> A Japanese soldier stood behind me as I turned . He seemed polite . He looked almost solid , nearly real . This kid could n't have been more than twenty-five , though with Japs it 's hard to tell . He wore one of those dink uniforms with a sash . He bowed . I bowed right back at him , or at least as well as a stiff back and hips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed downright civilized after bunking beside Burnside . The bow seemed to please the kid . He smiled , then vanished . Puff . Little blue mist . Nothing . <p> I turned to Burnside , and Burnside was so bleached I thought he died . His bald head shone , and fluorescent light lay across it like polish . Those heavy shoulders slumped , and his mouth formed what I feared was a permanent " oh . " Then his hands stirred . " This is serious ; " he said . " Pour another shot , but do n't pass the bottle . I 'll drop it surely . " <p> I sat on the bed , and my hand , which naturally trembles , really trembled . The whiskey , which is one of the last good things in life , rolled my gut , but was worth the roll . " Tell me , " I said to Burnside . <p> " It happened on the Canal , " he told me . " At the time he was a better man than me . We accidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the gut and my M1 popped its clip . Empty . He leaned on a tree , slid down to sit on his butt , and pointed a pistol at me . He studied the situation , and saw how we 'd all been reamed . I could see it in his eyes . He just plain said , ' Aw , screw it , ' which is ' shiranu ga hotoke ' in Japanese . Then he flipped the pistol away , tipped on his side , and declared peace on all the world . " <p> Rubber soles padded in the hall and I hid the bottle beneath a pillow . Burnside 's ears are not as sharp as mine . He took my signal , though , and had his face more or less composed by the time nurse Johnson entered the room . " There 's a little more to it , " he whispered . <p> " This had better not be happy hour , " Johnson said as she entered . Nurse Johnson is on day shift , and that improves our days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Johnson gets more dejected than most of the other nurses when she loses a patient , and she 'd just lost Harvey . Sometimes she hangs around us , I swear , just because we still show a little life . It perks her up . We do our best to behave indecent . <p> In this geriatric ward doctors outrank Jesus , who , as the Navy boys will tell you , was only a carpenter 's mate . Doctors , though , stand with God at their right hands . Nurses range in rank from cherub right on up to holy saint . <p> And how , one may well ask , did all this come about ? And where , one may well ask , does Nurse Johnson fit among that celestial chorus ? And for how long , one may further ask , has Burnside been trying to put the make on her ? <p> Take it by-the-numbers , because Burnside is n't going to score anyway , so there 's no big hurry : <p> Some people here are dark towers of pain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Burnside , for all his fanny rides a wheelchair , qualifies as a dark tower with flares burning at the top . You do n't become a compressed mound , around here , until you lose sight of everything happening beyond your own body . When the body is all that 's left for the brain to think about , doctors become the center of the universe . If Burnside did not cuss presidents , and chase women , and originate reams of originals and copies in the way of bullshit , he 'd become a mound . I would myself , except , of course , nothing about me hurts except my walker which has four legs and thus more opportunity . <p> And who am I to judge ? At this age everybody has his own pain and his own ghosts , or his own memories ; and perhaps ghosts and memories are all the same . People wrap themselves in the past , spinning cocoons around pain . Memories insulate against the ice of death creeping upward from their feet , against eternal cold entering their veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by woodstoves . . . although ice-flowers form on window panes of the soul ; and they dream of a cherry tree in blossom , and perhaps the welcoming smile of a girl they met but once , yet dreamed of always . <p> So who am I to judge ? I 'm just another dogface who rode the G.I. Bill . A dogface who became a high school history teacher who became retired , who became adjudged incapable of living alone ; and maybe the judges were right . On the other hand I 've seen Europe and Asia , and know how to run B.A.R.s , 30 m.m.m.g.s , mortars , and tests in American history given to teenagers equally endowed with hope and beauty and zits . <p> And Nurse Johnson , who is she ? <p> She 's one of those dreamers for whom the world has no time . Let 's call her early thirties , which is kindly , and beautiful , which is true . She tucks her long hair up under her silly little cap , and walks long-legged through these halls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . Her nose is a little too sharp for the cover of fashion magazines , and her look is too kindly to ever get her hired for television . Her eyes are hazel , her mouth generous , her body enticingly slight . She moves like a girl when she 's happy , and the soul of tiredness when she 's not . Nurse Johnson cares too much about her job , and is going to burn out . I hope she holds on until Burnside passes . Burnside claims to have spent his whole life in debauchery , and Nurse Johnson , who is his greatest challenge , should also be his last sight when leaving this vale . <p> And thus , in the ranks of heaven , is Nurse Johnson a one-ring Warrant officer , which is just enough gold braid to sing alto in the chorus of the Lord . <p> " It 's these fast machines , " Burnside said to me and patted his wheelchair . " They always get the girls . " To Nurse Johnson he said , " Sergeant Ross was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I sat , smiled a sad little smile , and pretended to ignore Burnside . " The dayroom 's in an uproar . You guys did something that upset everybody . What ? " Her hair is kind of dishwater blond , but gleamy . It fluffs and softens the effect of that sharp little nose . <p> " Nothing much , " I lied . " Burnside told a couple sea stories . Corporal Harvey kicked . Burnside sang something about Minnie the Moocher . Burnside 's the man you want . " No good could come from telling any nurse about an infestation of ghosts . <p> I hate to see so much sorrow in a face , and Johnson 's reflected about as much sorrow as anyone could bear . She ca n't get it through her head that being dead is not that big a deal . Toward the end Harvey 's pain outpaced the drags . He was bed-ridden . He would n't put up with spending his life in bed , nor would I , nor would Burnside . . . at least not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I liked Corporal Harvey , even if he did hang out with you guys . " Johnson should work in a maternity ward , not with geriatrics . " Minnie the Moocher , " she said to me . " Do you guys ever tell the truth ? " <p> " On Sundays . " <p> " Or when it do n't cost a red cent , " Burnside said . " Sergeant Ross is cheap , but I know how to show a girl a good time . " As he spoke he kept looking around like a man searching the jungle for snipers . His Japanese ghost would probably not show up with a nurse nearby , but with ghosts who can tell ? <p> " Both of you are going to hate this , or at least I think you are . " Nurse Johnson 's mouth held just the littlest bit of a sad smile . Her eyelids were a little blinky , a little teary . It came to me that maybe we 're more to her than pluses or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , no sense getting too emotional . <p> " Corporal Harvey understands why the Buddha smiles , " she said to me . " He told me to say that to you . He also told me that he has been instructed not to explain it to you . " She turned to Burnside , and she sort of bit her lower lip . <p> I tipped and nearly fell off the edge of the bed . Nurse Johnson was flipping it right back at us . Men dying of cancer do not leave final messages . Men dying of cancer live in great caverns of pain , caverns illumined with the unrighteous fires of infernos real as those of Dante . Men dying of cancer writhe internally , the violence and chaos of tumor overreaching any last intelligence . Pain becomes pure , probably , and maybe such purity has something to do with the Buddha , but sure as hell men do n't talk about it . <p> " And for Sergeant Burnside , " Nurse Johnson said , " and I quote verbatim : Harvey said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest job . ' " <p> " Got the last word , did n't he ? " Burnside 's voice filled with admiration even as he continued to scout the room . " Harvey always could pile it on . " Burnside was not exactly distracted , but his attention went toward shadows in corners , or any other place that might hide visions and worries from the past . <p> I sort of blinked at Nurse Johnson , and she sort of winked at me . Burnside sat between us , and Burnside was stupidly buying every ounce of it . I figured this day marked a turning point in Nurse Johnson 's career . This was bigger than Paul Bunyon . She had just bullshitted the most noted purveyor of b.s. ever to appear in the history of the American West . <p> For three days the geriatric ward fell back into the drone of routine , except for occasional sorties by TV stiffs . The lads , and two lasses , made tracks to the back windows of this wing beyond which lies Memorial Gardens , the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Soldier 's Home . <p> Burnside and I went as well , but we did not settle for looking out the windows . We inched through the doorway , onto a concrete terrace , and looked over the terrain , It was not a position I 'd wish to defend , and not a position I 'd wish to take . From a tactical point of view it 's an infantryman 's nightmare . <p> There 's a narrow strip of lawn bordering the terrace , then a narrow cemetery with gleaming markers running crosswise the hill as if some wiseacre had pasted a decorated bandage on nature . At the lower edge of the cemetery there 's third growth forest , gently sloping over desolate ground , the last undeveloped area . Beyond the forest a rickety footbridge spans a ravine , and , across the bridge and at the bottom of the hill , there lie the remnants of a Victorian park . The park was once a place where ladies and gentlemen strolled , and where children played . When this hospital went military in the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-limits . Maybe the darkness we 've but lately noticed has dwelt in that park among shadows of neglect . The covered bandstand is broken , the roof cracked , the steps rotted . Ornamental iron fences are rusted , and ornamental trees stand unpruned , while hedges are overgrown . From a distance , though , it still looks like a spot of sanity in all that desolation . <p> No one goes there anymore , not even to cut firewood . Our V.A . ghosts do n't go there . If it is a haunted wood , a haunted park , a haunted spot of history , then it 's haunted by something more hideous than ghosts , and more dangerous than guns . This hospital has its safe side , with roads and lawns . It has this dark side , dark nearly to black , empty of life . Not even a bird chirps , and the only way you could defend that position would be with light artillery . If you attacked it you would get nothing but tree bursts from mortars . <p> Burnside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across rows of glowing white cemetery stones beneath the flowing flag of a great nation . We gazed toward the forest , the ravine , then toward a city that once exported food and manufactures to the world , a city that now exports only noise and entertainment ; and imports everything else . Not one of the TV stiffs , viewing that lordly flag and chronically troubled city , had enough gumption to rub his crotch . <p> " There 's more to tell about that kid , " I later said to Burnside , reminding him about his Japanese ghost . <p> " He was young , and I made him dead . You 'll recall there was a war goin ' on . I was only young . I figured to score information about the enemy . I went through his pockets . " Burnside motioned upward to the remnants of the Japanese battle flag . " They carried these personal battle flags . He can have it back . I only use it to get the girls . Women ca n't resist that kind of accomplishment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was having a hard time spreading it ; and that was another first . <p> Change filled the air like low-grade electricity . Everyone , except those in the final stages of senility  --  and maybe even those  --  could sense that the far side put together its own routine . <p> Shadows drifted along the walls , although nothing solid enough to cause a shadow appeared . Murmurs hovered behind everyone 's ears , little whispers from the past . After the first day , newsreels began running in our minds , newsreels of the passing parade , a parade of history and war . I heard voices of people dead and gone , some of them loved , and some despised . I heard mutters of cannonade rumbling behind broken horizons . I heard terrified squalling of children , heard the voice of the enemy speaking crackling kraut language ; and I heard the sobbing of women , because , yes , it is possible to sob in German . <p> I heard again sounds from the invasion of Europe and sounds from emplacements in Korea .

You 're a nut case , Ross . " <p> Meanwhile , routine droned right along . Nurse Johnson remained busy , distracted , continually ignoring the pain of her job as she tried to reduce swelling in lives around her . Nurse Johnson heard no ghosts and saw none , perhaps being too busy . Routine sustained her and steadied us ; and this is the way routine runs , even in a geriatric ward invaded from the other world as  --  we may assume  --  most of them are . <p> Day begins at four A.M. when pain pills wear off . Very old people sleep but indifferently . We wake and wrestle whatever greets us , be it suppurating sores , or unknit bones . From four until six most lie in the stupor of half dreams . Voices from the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long dead , appear as in their youth . They bandy jokes , or present intense situations that never really happened , but could have if everyone had been smarter at the time . Fathers cuss and mothers explain . Sometimes a favorite aunt appears . . . but , sometimes , the hours between four and six breed monsters . Men see faces : of people they have killed , or women they betrayed . <p> At six A.M. pill time begins . Lights up . The stage opens to the day 's comedy  --  or tragedy if that be the will of the Lord . At six A.M. everyone coughs a lot , and if one is destined to die choking , the odds are best around six . Pills run the range of the pharmacopoeia . Drugs take on personalities . Most are plebian , some even duller , but some are simply splendid . Some drugs cause dreams to run a riff , a coda , a trumpet ride like Ziggy Elman playing " And the Angels Sing . " <p> Burnside , with a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being independent as a hog on ice , waits for no nurse or orderly . He has a system of stainless steel pulleys rigged over his bed . It 's like living next door to a circus . Still , it 's tough to see him swing here and there . The man would have made a fine elf or gremlin or leprechaun , or even a grown-up pixie , and he 's reduced to swinging like an ape . He lowers himself into his seat and heads for the latrine , the tattered battle flag like a broken sun above that rolling chair . <p> Breakfast comes at seven . You can take it in your room or hit the chow line at the cafeteria . Among geriatrics the chow line carries a message : line up here and tell the world you 're still kicking . <p> Our troops break bread in the company of younger patients , guys in their 40s to 60s who have their own specters , but who were not seeing ours . These are leftovers from later wars . Nearly all are cripples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust a one with rubber bands and paper clips , let alone a dull knife . <p> Physical therapy starts at 8:30 and lasts until you drop , which in most cases is 8:45 . Burnside does n't need it . His jaw works just elegant , and his legs are nearly ready to fall off , anyway . He gets plenty of wholesome push and pull from that chair . " I 'd get a Harley , " he complains , " but they do n't build ' em . " <p> Doctors pull rounds from ten to lunch . They detail hip replacements , spinal taps , and ' ectomies to rearrange the innards . The docs make time-tested jokes , and are capable of their own b.s . After all , what are wars created for ? <p> " Other hospitals ai n't this nice , " Burnside explains to anyone who bitches . " In Japan the nurses are all dykes . In England the docs sound like Mortimer Snerd . In Frogland . . . " he then rolls his eyes and tries to appear lewd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous big nose . DeGaulle was damn popular . " <p> Before lunch , and especially during uncertain days , we grab the Jim Beam , " have a little sip , " as Louis Armstrong used to say , then chase the whiskey with a bowl of soup . " It ai n't like South Dakota , " Burnside explains . " Back on the farm we never drank after four A.M. " Burnside credits South Dakota as the place that made him famous . After putting in his time , and drawing retirement from Uncle Sugar , he went back home . " The only available job in all of South Dakota was with a ports-pot outfit . " He worked and really strived . In just three months he got promoted to head poop . <p> After lunch and a nap , some patients receive visitors , be they relatives or social workers or church ladies or a chaplain . Some visitors bring photos of great-grandchildren , as if anyone here pretended to give a hang for the precious tykes , or photos of great-great grandchildren who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next century . Visitors talk valentine talk . I listen and imagine those kiddies as they will become , dressed in spandex uniforms , lasers at the ready , enduring fleabites as they crawl through mud , or lie chilled and sleeping on frozen tundra . I imagine them in trenches along some MLR , huddled behind a supersonic zap gun , and they have their shod feet tucked in sleeping bags to avoid going lame from freezing . Enjoy your childhoods , youngsters , because as long as there are humans there 'll always be the Infantry . <p> Burnside and I ran our visitors away more than a year ago , old age being a private occupation  --  and at the time we thought our reasons made sense . I honestly told my visitors to shove off , but Burnside waxed eloquent . He pretended to discover religion . His wheelchair became a pulpit . He preached , favoring Moses and Abraham , and Burnside scared himself half to death . He ran his visitors away all right , but among the TV stiffs he actually made a convert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , on his road to glory . " Packed him off to heaven , " Burnside mumbled , " . . . no good deed goes unpunished . . . stars in my crown . . . " The power of the Word scared the living bejesus out of Burnside , and that 's the truth of it . <p> Visitors leave by mid-afternoon , and then arrives The Hour of Charm . Until ghosts got into it , this was the hour of apparitions sliding just on the edge of perception . We could almost see days of our youth , hear the clatter of new model T Fords , or the very first singing commercial from the domed cathedral of a radio aglow with vacuum tubes . We listened as fathers and uncles bulled widely about World War I , while grandfathers flipped b.s. about Gettysburg and Shiloh , or Cuba , or the last of the Indian wars . The Hour of Charm brought a rustle of cornfields beneath midwest sun , the whisper of great rivers : the Mississippi , the Ohio , the Columbia ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mountain , prairie , thin fields of cotton , hardwood forests . <p> Everything changed as ghosts put together their own lash up . Burnside 's Nipponese soldier was first , but not alone . By the third day our ghosts had their drill down pat . The farside stepped forward as a Burnside story progressed : <p> Burnside parked in the dayroom and told how his uncle Henry saved a church after its congregation came up busted . The preacher buried uncle Henry in a likely field , then called the field a church cemetery and free of tax . As prices rose he sold the field , moved uncle Henry to another field . . . " . . . and Unc tax-exempted more land through the years than Alexander the Great . The preacher finally quit when the coffin wore out . Unc was holding up just fine . . . . " <p> At that point doors and windows opened . They moved methodically , not slow , but no snap to it either . Some doors and windows were real , and real weather blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freeway came rain-ridden breeze carrying car fumes . Puget Sound contributed a little whiff of salt , and northwest mist became a sheen of moisture touching us like a thin coat of protecting fur . <p> Nurses closed windows , hissed at orderlies who closed doors , and staff had Burnside singled out for blame before the last breeze choked . Burnside , caught mid-story , sat blinking , silent , his tale-spinning out of balance as surrealism took over ; because another door opened in the center of the dayroom , and this was a door of tribulation through which only we geriatrics could pass . Staff saw nothing . <p> The door opened on a scene , like rushes for a movie in which no one would want to star . An enormous room lay before us , and ranks of coffins shone dull and black before the backdrop of night . Silence as profound as eternity lay within that night . Silence resonated with power , silence that could be broken only by some mighty force , because the power of that silence swallowed all ordinary sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Silence and darkness surrounded frail boxes containing remains even more frail . No spirits lay enclosed there , only corpses embraced by that greatest of all silences , embraced by final darkness . <p> Nurse Johnson sat as the single mourner , and her low sobs were the only sounds powerful enough to break that silence . Her face was barely composed , her lips trembly as they moved in prayers or confusion , her eyes red from weeping . She seemed such a small figure huddled before eternal night . We sensed her confusion , her loneliness , failure , sorrow ; and we knew that each of us in that dayroom rested in one of those coffins . We knew the future by recognizing we were the past . <p> Nurse Johnson is a very good kid in a very bad world . We fight pain with pain , but she does not understand that , and sometimes it does n't work all that well , anyway . The coffins sent a message , or seemed to , and the message needed figuring because it said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are not lost . There is one more job to do . Figure it out , you sergeants and corporals and warrants . You once stirred the depths of history the way bakers stir cake mix . Get it figured , Jerks . <p> The enormous room , standing before eternal dark , now became shaded as if night pulled the curtain on dreams as well as life . Light drained into dusk , and movement began among the coffins . They did not open so much as they peeled away , like the droop of decaying flowers . The coffins vanished and we , the congregated souls of the V.A . geriatric ward , lay coffinless . Old bodies stretched frail as tissue across bones fragile as the frame of a child 's kite . We , a museum of the dead , lay in diminishing light . Then , sinking into darkness , our bodies disappeared and only a touch of light remained , like a wisp of smoke above dead faces ; old faces ; closed eyes behind which lay departed hope . The curtain of dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to register through eternal night was the sound of Nurse Johnson sobbing , <p> II " Come out of it . Please do . " She gently shook my shoulder , because she is used to dealing with frail things . Nurse Johnson stood beside me as , it seemed , half the staff of this enormous place flurried around the dayroom . Shocked patients muttered to themselves , or turned toward each other with looks of belief , not disbelief ; and belief had us running scared . Even senility cases looked in touch , and no damn quarrels started over what was illusion and what was real . People looked at each other , and silent messages passed . Nobody had seen anything . Pass it on . Make it clear even to those dumb Marines . Semper Fi , jarheads . Zip your lip and your fly . Shut down the detail . <p> " It 's okay , " I whispered to her . " At least I think it is . " When she takes my wrist for a pulse , or Burnside 's wrist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled her touch is that of a woman who loves . I do not say " lover , " but one who gently , whether motherly or sisterly or even as a lover  --  touches with perfect knowledge of how affection is shown . At such times Burnside stops his mouth with stutters . He turns a shade once known as panty-pink , which is the most blood he can summon for a blush . <p> When she takes my wrist I remember my first young love . Years shrug away like scabs from the skinned knees of youth . I feel weak as a ten-year-old who coasts his Western Flyer into a tree . <p> " We had hallucinations , " I whispered . " It happens among cripples and sad sacks . I blame it on the New Deal . I even blame it on Eleanor . There was a time back in Indiana when we let the cats out . . . " Then I began to mumble . Nurse Johnson is used to geriatrics wandering in their minds , but she 's also accustomed to me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told me . " Dementia is bad enough when it 's real . " <p> I would never say " bullshit " in front of a lady . " After Harvey passed you kidded Burnside , " I whispered . " Did it help ? " <p> She whispered back . " Are we really talking ? Are you serious ? " Her whisper is like dandelion down riding warm breezes . Where was this woman when I was her age and lonely ? Not born yet . Ships pass , and I would rather die than put up with being young again . Since that 's what 's going to happen my attitude is wholesome . At the same time , ships pass in history and not just on ponds . <p> " I 'm serious , " I said . " You conned Burnside . Did it help you ? Not , did it help Burnside , or me . Did it help you ? " <p> " It made me sad . It was fun for a minute , and then it made me sad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure as gospel did n't want . <p> " All suffering is wrong , " she said . " Dog suffering is wrong . Even bug suffering is wrong . " She struggled with some sort of nursish ethics , and decided in my case to make an exception . " Corporal Harve . . . " She honestly choked , a genuine chokeup . <p> " It hurt him . " I tried to make my voice kind . " It 's supposed to hurt . Part of the rules . " <p> Around us staff moved with the caution of a combat patrol . They whispered to patients , and glanced at doors and windows . V.A . hospitals are not supposed to be weird . They are supposed to be palaces of dependability , dull as prunes . <p> " You beat the Bible , " I told her . " The Bible gives us three score and ten . You helped Harvey make it for ten years beyond that . " I stopped . She did not want to hear that . Her thought lay elsewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timidly . " Something awful is chasing you guys . " <p> I sat frozen . Someone turned up the volume on the television . Soap is soap , but terror has some shape to it . Around me staff settled patients back into manageable routine , and patients looked at each other with unspoken promises to talk as soon as we got rid of staff . <p> Something awful chased us . It was not only what Johnson said , but the way she said it . Something awful . <p> Memories flashed . We once had our m.g.s dug in on Hill Seven-twenty in Korea , losing more men from freeze than from enemy fire . Ice . Snow . Blood on snow . Chinese corpses lay strewn across roads and fields and ditches like seed , frozen , mouths open , ice on their teeth . Here and there smoke plumes rose where our troops burned farmers ' houses in order to stay alive . Oil on the m.g.s froze , making their action sluggish . Hill Seven-twenty spelled Hell on Earth . Nurse Johnson talked about something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid with experience . She has n't seen as many men die as I have , because that would amount to several , but she may have seen a couple dozen . If Harvey died differently she would know . I shuddered before a chill . I sat feeble and helpless . My teeth clicked . <p> Hill Seven-twenty was a comfort because you knew that for the rest of your life you would never be more miserable . This was different . We now spoke of something after death , and my chill came because of Johnson 's words , and because ghosts waved goodbye . Burnside said those goodbyes made him uneasy . I wish to God I could settle for " uneasy . " <p> " I 'm not a preacher , " I told her . " What do you mean , ' spirit ' ? " <p> " I 'm not a preacher either , but when Corporal Harvey died nothing happened . Nothing . " <p> " I do n't read you . " <p> " Absolutely nothing . " <p> " You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When men die they sort of expire , assuming they are not blown to bits . Something happens . The person leaves . Nothing romantic about it , nothing impressive . They just go until they stop , and then stop . Sometimes the body ticks on for a second or seconds . The point is , no matter how minuscule , something always happens . There is a stepping off , a final sigh or choke or spasm . Always . When you turn out a light bulb you are aware that light departs . It goes quick , but there is a " going away . " Same with men who die . <p> And with Harvey nothing happened . Something nailed him before he could give a final shrug . I mourned Harvey for exactly two seconds , and would mourn more later  --  if there was going to be a " later . " <p> Nurse Johnson trembled . " I should keep quiet when I do n't know what I 'm talking about . " <p> In general that 's true , because it stands her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in this case it was n't true . " You did me a favor , " I told her . " Maybe you did all of us a favor . Will you help me to my room ? " <p> Helplessness is the lousiest of lousy feelings . Around here we pretend independence , but could not defend ourselves against a bouncing puppy ; and at our age a bouncing puppy can kill . One stumble , one fall . The clock was running . If something popped Harvey , it waited to pop us . We had little time for defense , were physically capable of squat . This would take brains , and half the brains in this asylum are covered with dust . <p> Ghosts accompanied us as Nurse Johnson led me to my room , whispy ghosts who made no points . These were people I never knew or even shot at . They were vaguely oriental , maybe Malay , and small but pretty . They went nervously about their business , but even in these polished halls I could smell , like an echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malay the cordite likely came from Japanese artillery . These Malays sort of chirped in that soft , island language that seems all vowels , and Nurse Johnson led me through packs of them . You can get used to anything . <p> I wondered what Burnside saw , and waited in the room knowing he would come a-rolling any minute . Nurse Johnson parked me , patted my shoulder with a gentle hand , and went about her business . <p> Ghosts passed before me , around me , and it really did n't matter . They are around us , always , and we pay no attention . They are spirits of the past , and the past is friendly . The reason to understand history is not to avoid the mistakes of history  --  because some fool will make those mistakes for you . Some maniac will start a war , and some other maniac will drop an atom bomb , and you 'll be the poor bastard who gets to drop the bomb or be hit by it . <p> No , you understand history so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room he looked like a man who needed the chaplain . His chair moved slowly , the tattered battle flag not lifted by any breeze , and Burnside was a man who had the trap knocked out of him . He swung into bed like he aimed to stay for the duration . Not a good sign . <p> He turned on his side . Then he fidgeted ; did n't like the idea , turned on his back and stared at the ceiling . He did n't like that either , so he sat up and did some truly magnificent cussing . He swore quietly , like a man talking to a jammed carbine while fearing the enemy is in the neighborhood and close . He did n't repeat a word . It was stupendous cussing . Inspired . <p> " . . . like a garage sale at a mortuary , " he said finally . " Ross , we 're boogered on this one . We got a Chinaman 's chance in Toyko , that 's what we got . " <p> I did n't contradict , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get elaborate ? Our ghosts seemed trying to help . <p> " They 're trying to tell us something , , " I said to Burnside . I did not say anything about Harvey . No reason to send Burnside into deeper funk . " Plus , " I told him , " other ghosts seem trying to help . Your Japanese kid was never on staff around here before . " <p> From beyond the doorway the hall filled with murmurs , and from the dayroom a voice raised in a thin cry . One of the senility boys sang " . . . you do n't know what lonesome is ' til you get to herdin ' cows . . . . " followed by , " here 's to the captain , here 's to the crew , and here 's to the girls . . . . " and somebody hushed him . <p> " I copped my first feel , at least the first feel I remember , when I was six . " Burnside seemed about to become senile himself . Either that , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story  --  waited for the end of the world  --  for the dead to rise  --  for the second coming  --  for a face-to-face with whatever dark evil waited to axe our spirits . <p> " . . . there was no call to kill that kid , " Burnside whispered . " We could of worked something out . We could have both kept running . " His voice became harsh and controlled , the kind of voice a noncorn uses when he reads out a total screwup . We take pride in not feeling sorry for ourselves , but Burnside took it a little too far . He had bullshitted around this issue for his whole life , and now the b.s. did n't work . He would not be talking harsh if he was not eating away on guilt . You 'd think , after all these years , the Japanese kid would be at peace . You 'd think Burnside would have come to terms with it . Instead he sat , wiped , totally blown out of town . <p> " Shish kata ga nai . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " It was a fatality , a fatalism . Forget it . " <p> " He was skinny at the time , " Burnside said in a voice just above a whisper . " They were on short rations . Skinny and sick and dirty in that crappy way you only get in jungles . He had diarrhea . Even after he died . " <p> The kid looked better as a ghost . Clean uniform , healthy smile . Death seemed to agree with him . I was n't proud of the way I thought . There is b.s. and there is sick b.s . I whispered , " Good luck , soldier . " <p> " You know how it goes , " Burnside said . " He maybe was n't the first , but he was the worst . Dammit , Ross . " <p> I knew what he meant . I also owned problems in that line , but did n't want to think about them . . . and thanks for the memories . <p> " Both of you were wrong , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier who acted like a priest . He sentenced you to life . You lived it . He did n't . You 're both kicked in your ornaments . " Some kind of flak erupted in the dayroom . A quavery voice began reciting poetry in the sing-song-y manner of schoolkids . The guy tried a passage from " The Wreck of the Hesperus . " Memorized in about sixth grade . He got it wrong , but mostly right . <p> " I 'm so damn popular , " Burnside said , " because I overcharge and do poor work . " He lay down , turned his back to me . " If something 's gon na happen , let it . " <p> Men sometimes acted this way in Korea . Temperatures dropped . Chinese artillery pounded . Chinese attacked . They came in swarms , and there did not seem enough explosive in the world to stop them . After the heat of attack , and as sweat began to freeze deep in our clothes , a man might climb into his sleeping bag where he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man became pupa , determined not to hatch . Men did that when they gave up . You could n't even kick them out of those bags . Men died in attacks because they lay snugged in , refusing that last ration of hell the world so generously served . <p> " I got a problem , " I said to Burnside . " I do n't have the strength to club your sorry butt . " <p> He grunted . " I know a guy , " he mumbled , " that when he dies is going to have his ashes sprinkled on a farm in South Dakota . " <p> " . . . a thumbnail history of the Japanese on Guadalcanal , " I told him . " Courage , combined with stupidity , does not make successful soldiers . Think about that before you check out . " Here he was , talking about his ashes while I 'm sweating his spirit . <p> Still , it was his spirit . One man , one vote . <p> I sensed movement in the far corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mist did not seem occidental . If our ghosts tried to help then Burnside lay as perfect fodder . The mist might contain a clot of Burnside 's personal ghosts . I did n't say a word . Just shuffled away on legs not exactly inspired , but feeling less worse than usual . The Japanese kid , and maybe an entire slew of ghosts , formed up to do a number on Burnside . Either ghosts are a metaphor for history , or history is a metaphor for ghosts . <p> Nurse Johnson would think I was a real gadabout . I moved back toward the dayroom feeling grim . Absolute Evil exists . As kids we geriatrics learned all about it , and no damn social worker had better come along and blame " evil " on " conditions . " Evil is a force in the universe , a force using any weakness it finds to do its dirt ; and with Evil , Hell is just a sideline . <p> My mind sorrowed . Harvey had been snatched . He was an old , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blithe . If his spirit lay hostage , or destroyed , even ghostland took a loss . <p> Besides , Harvey was a good friend . We weep no tears , knowing he would be too proud of us to weep for us . Still , there are such things as invisible tears . Nurse Johnson weeps them , as well as the other kind . <p> And then there is Nurse Johnson , a good kid in a bad world . Her world reeks with folk who hold no beliefs , or cheap beliefs ; people who hope , when they die , to report to Saint Peter with clean bowels . They worry about cholesterol while their kids shoot each other down in the streets . <p> Nurse Johnson lives in a nation that whines over self-inflicted wounds while claiming itself a victim . At least the people I walked toward did not have minds filled with that kind of shinola . Like everyone else we are filled with a certain amount of crap , but not that crap . <p> . . . something feathered around my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures , or the whisper of someone long dead who wanted to pass me a tip . I almost understood our final act , and why we must act . Then the feathery thing went away . I started counting backward from 100 , it 's the classic test to see if you 've got Alzheimer 's . The feathery notion might return , because 99 went to 98 , and so forth . . . . <p> Evil uses Hell as a parking lot , and you do n't have to die to park . Evil sets people in the middle of war , famine , excess prosperity , or other of Hell 's appurtenances , then stands back as people freeze or sizzle ; and screw themselves . The main interest of Evil is destruction of faith in gods and ethics , knowledge and honor . When faith is destroyed people create their own hells , and a sign stretches across the universe writ large for all to see . It reads : The Future Is Canceled . <p> Maybe it was not simply our spirits at risk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing hard time . Maybe Nurse Johnson , and all the other fine people I did n't know , but who must be in the world , were at risk . When faith is destroyed , what happens to those who are faithful to their trust ? I tottered along figuring that if evil was after me I could stand it , but if it came for Nurse Johnson then this pilgrim was pissed . <p> No sound came from behind me , but ahead sounded a mixture of querulous voices . Mortar fire properly timed sounds like tearing paper , and so did the voices . Distance to the dayroom is sixty feet . At flank speed I could have made it in two minutes , but my own ghosts picked that moment for their own . <p> I leaned against a wall and found myself looking down at a misted valley-plain of rice paddies , and for once I owned the high ground . Rocks lay scattered around a low crest of hills . Behind me rose a stark mountain blasted black by gunfire . My squad had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea , early in the war . I watched the plain , watched ground mist rise from the paddies , and knew this was a rerun . I fought against doing this twice , because no one sane would want to do it once . <p> Five white specks appeared in the distance and moved toward me . I knew them , did not know their names . They were patriarchs , five old men dressed in white , men who should have died in the quiet security of their homes , surrounded by sons and daughters and grandchildren . They were men who had once been the man I would become , old , not wise , but smart for their day and time . <p> They moved slowly through mist , as reluctant as I to again confront madness . In mist behind them , like on a movie screen , rose pictures of a few faces of Hell ; reels of Pathay News , the March of Time ; buildings breaking beneath artillery , walls crumbling about women and children crouching in cellars . And from the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jackets still afloat , bobbing , the heads of sailors so thriftily held above the waves now turned to bleached and polished skulls . <p> The old Koreans moved toward me . Armbands with Korean writing showed them as Rok , Republic of Korea , allies . Two carried old-fashioned , long-barreled squirrel rifles , because there were bandits in these mountains . The other three walked with staffs . As they approached they smiled , but that is not the way it went the first time . The first time went like this : <p> My squad dug in behind a low ridge overlooking a valley . We had a long , thin line not well armed . We did not have enough men across a broad front , and North Koreans banzaied one section of the line , then another . They kept it up all afternoon . We stacked them up like cordwood , and they stacked us . <p> Night came down moonless , darker than the bottom of a nighttime sea . Only our ears hinted at movement in the valley . From far , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay alone , because neither side of the line so much as wiggled . There might be wounded out there , or it might be a trick . <p> The North Koreans hit again at midnight . They banzaied the left of our line , then banzaied again . Night came alive with tracers , and action rolled beneath flares as our mortars illuminated the valley . The attack was too far to our left to mean anything , except indignation . The attack made so much noise we could not tell what might gather right in front of us . <p> I froze to the pistol grip of the m.g . We heard nothing . No flares danced overhead . Night seemed concentrated , pointed , directed at our very sanity . Night seemed ready to explode with oriental voices , faces , the screams of a mindless horde , hell-a-poppin ' , Hell incarnate . <p> Then , to our left , the second attack stopped . Flares snuffed , darkness returned . The valley once more seemed covered with the dying . <p> " My momma did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our guys whispered , " so what are we doin ' . . . . " and then he shut up . <p> Slightly to our right and so close as to seem underfoot , a noise clicked . Wood on rock , like a rifle butt carried too low . To my right the other m.g. opened at that first snick of sound . Riflemen fired blindly , hysteric . I fired like one insane , like a man trying to kill the night , finally forcing my finger off the trigger before the barrel melted . <p> From right in front of us came a cry , " Ai-gue ! Ai-gue ! " Then a torrent of words , and then a single voice , " Ai-gue ! Ai-gue ! " I burned the rest of the ammo belt , the m.g. bouncing like a mad instrument as I rose , trying to get further depression . The voice sobbed . " Ai-gue . Ai-gue . " <p> " Do that sonovabitch , " someone yelled . " For Chrissake , stop the noise . " <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then emptied a carbine in the direction of the voice . Silence . Silence . We shivered until dawn . <p> Korean bodies are no more remarkable than Chinese bodies , but they wear different clothes . As first light crept across the sky , lumps of white shone nearly luminescent on the downhill slope . Light gathered to show the banzai attack we fought so hysterically was no attack at all . Five old men , two nearly headless from repeated hits , lay with white beards running red . White clothing shone black-stained with drying blood . The corpses lay small and tangled . They lay like the death of history . <p> Our company commander appeared through morning mist , checking the line , doing his job . He looked over the ridge , looked at the corpses , said , " Musta been one whale of a fight , " and walked on down the line . We sat fully ashamed , wondering " what the hell , " when along came a corpsman who knew a little Korean . He said " Ai-gue ! Ai-gue ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now they stood before me . Koreans are taller than most orientals , and these old men stood straight but not stiff . I leaned against the wall , waited , wondering if this was going to be death or a dry run . <p> They waited as well . Very polite , but not Jap polite . Koreans take a different fix on good behavior . <p> " Do n't think I have n't thought about it , " I told them , and did not know whether words ran from my mouth or only from my thought . " You guys were probably trying to cut a deal for your village . Maybe with us , maybe with the North . You carried two flags , depending on which army was in your neighborhood , and you did it to protect your kids . " <p> They smiled . Koreans are not inscrutable , at least not when they 're being honest . One nodded . I actually saw them relax , like a sense of relief swept over them . <p> " And you heard all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the base of that ridge . " I watched them . So far , so good . They watched me with interest . " But your mistake was to move at night . You could not tell where the lines were dug in . " <p> The tallest one framed the word , " anio , " " no , " with his mouth . No sound . Just the shape of the word . <p> " Then you had to move at night ? " <p> The mouth framed " neh , " " yes . " <p> " Then you were the advance . . . . " I broke off , knowing after all these years , why those men suddenly appeared under our guns . Their entire village must have been fleeing south . The enfiladed valley could not be crossed . These old men led , trying to find a way across the ridge and onto the mountain before the sun rose over their women and children . Their young men would have been gone , pressed into service by the North , or held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people made it , " I said , " and I honor you . " <p> They turned to look across the valley where people worked in rice paddies , where farmer 's houses sat small and distinct , and where raised paths carried the normal traffic of normal living . I heard music few occidentals can really understand , saw forms and shapes of costumes and dress , saw children sitting beside grandmothers . I saw old fashioned cities , quiet streets , small shops , colorful flags and ornaments and decorations  --  life before machine guns , before communism and capitalism and the ambition of generals . <p> And then the scene changed as across the valley rolled a totality of darkness . It came crashing like a tidal wave , and , churning like a wave in the darkness , were flashes of neon , the static of electronics , the buzz and hiss and crackle of a brave new world . The old men stood facing the surge and thump of modern times . They stood squarely , waiting the approach of darkness , then stepped toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an all-out fight . Darkness rolled toward them , the valley disappeared , and the scene faded , dispersed ; and I found myself leaning against a hospital wall and pointed toward the dayroom . <p> It was about as much action as this child could take . I inched forward looking for a chair , even one before a TV . I would park my carcass and take a blow . Unreal spooks lived on television , electronic spooks with names and haircuts ; mindless noise . It would n't be the same but it might be restful . I wondered how Burnside made out back in our room . I wondered if Burnside 's ghosts were having any luck . I halfway wished he would show up . <p> In the dayroom patterns of light swirled , illuminated faces , cast shadows ; and nothing looked restful . Light danced phantasmic as aurora borealis , flashing across old faces , wattled necks , scraggly limbs . Where normal light should fall through large windows , darkness glowered . Oppressive gloom lay beyond those windows . Even as I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as reaches of space . Black was not simply a presence , but an aggressive absence of light . It backgrounded weirdly illuminated figures of my companions , made them into pictures surreal as effusions of Dali  --  fearsome as improbable Laughter issuing from the depths of mausoleums . <p> Each person in that dayroom was surrounded by his own ghosts . Ghosts of the enemy mixed with ghosts of the Allies . Reinforcements seemed to be coming in from everywhere . I wondered if this was a last bastion , a place of some fateful and final resolution . I lined myself up in the direction of a chair and putzed forward . I heard the swish of a wheelchair . <p> " Be thankful for bald-headed people , " Burnside said . " Ross , I got a problem . " He wheeled his chair in front of me , twirled a couple of circles , and Burnside 's mouth might be tossing a minor load of b.s. but the line across that mouth was firm . The old sarge was back on top of things . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you gained weight , or have you done something with your hair ? " It was obvious that Burnside 's ghosts had given him some sort of reason to quit pouting . <p> " . . . getting stuff settled with that kid . It cheered him somewhat . " Burnside looked around the dayroom. " . . . like old home week at the pearly gates , " he muttered . He watched some of the action , shook his head ; steered his chair between me and the goings-on like a machine gunner covering a retreat . " The Good Book says ' This too shall pass , ' and I 've found that 's always true , except in the case of gallstones . " <p> " Welcome back , " I told him and found a chair . The TV bubbled mindlessly as I watched the dayroom . What with all the silent messages between ghosts and geriatrics , what I saw was wild and less than wonderful  --  like a Chinese fire drill  --  the Greek airforce  --  the Estonian navy . <p> Mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present , everything mixed ; and , as everything mixed , darkness grew as people and ghosts became diminutive . We were getting cut down to size by darkness  --  and where it came from  --  what it wanted  --  I could not tell . <p> " Did you ever hate anybody you were shooting at ? " It was a dumb question in Burnside 's mouth , the kind of question an old soldier is not supposed to ask . There are standard attitudes toward the enemy , and old soldiers are supposed to know them . <p> I was still pretty shaken up . My breath came fast and shallow . " Only when they shot back . " That was not strictly true . I did not hate the standard Kraut or standard North Korean , but the German S.S. would never rest peaceful in my mind . <p> " Because , " Burnside mused , " they were just dog soldiers . Doing a job . Nothing to get hateful about . " <p> Either Burnside suffered a conversion , and angelic wings were about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or else his ghosts told him something that made him confidential . He talked about pretty personal stuff . <p> " The Bataan death march , " I told him . " So much for your dog soldiers . " <p> " You 're a man of many parts , though somewhat scattered . Do n't trap me about the far east . " <p> What I know about the far east mostly has to do with broken cities and broken bodies . I did not spend time on R &R,; and did not spend time on occupation . " History itself is scattered , " I said , " and do n't crap me about Bataan . I reckon you 've been in touch with the farside . " <p> We watched the dayroom , the encroaching dark , as the show began to fade . Geriatrics stood wiped out . Ghosts winked out . people stared at empty space , then turned to each other ; murmured , touched hands , checked the " realness " of people and things . They jiggled chairs before sitting , just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet . Each and every . one of those kids started beating his gums . <p> " Toyko and peanut butter , " Burnside said , " and if that is n't the damndest ? " He watched our troops jaw at each other . " Makes you yearn for South Dakota . " <p> Darkness faded , but glowered as it faded . Darkness might disappear along with our haunts , but it seemed to wait just beyond the daylight windows . It was there , pressing , and it would come for us in its time . <p> " Get a little more exact , " I said . " Peanut butter ? " <p> " We 're sitting pretty here , " Burnside said , " and Ross , you 've become neglectful . What I 'm gon na tell you is straight dope . " <p> I waited for another Burnside story , figuring he would bull around some little while before getting to the point . It was a mistake . If you hit Burnside with an expectation he 'll usually exceed it . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We raised a whole generation on peanut butter . " <p> Oriental diets are generally thin on protein . During the occupation some very bright people used peanut butter to raise protein levels among children . The kids , being kids , lapped it up . <p> " One thing led to another , " Burnside said . " By now those kids are hurting and do n't even know it . I find it less than fascinatin ' . " <p> " You and the farside had a go-around . Then you haul out of bed and get cracking . Now you 're blowing smoke . What . " <p> " The Japanese kid showed me Tokyo . Tokyo ai n't Tokyo anymore , " Burnside said . " It 's a damn party . Something 's dying in the Jap spirit . The past is dying , but something else is dying . " Burnside has never been real subtle . Furrows on his forehead did not stop where the hairline had once ended . " I do n't get it , " he told me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get off your goldbrickin ' butt and get an honest job . ' " <p> That would have been an interesting conversation , except our ghosts were n't talking . Burnside imagined things . <p> " Payback time , " he said . " It 's the least I can do for the kid . " <p> He really fretted about his Japanese soldier . Bad enough we tried to figure a message , now Burnside had to get his morals in gear . <p> " I got roughly the same message from Korea , " I told him , " but it came from the countryside , not the city . " <p> Burnside looked like a man in mourning . " Her name was Yukiko . I should of brought her home with me . " Burnside was saturated in guilt up to his starched little dickie . " During ' 44 she lived in a cave with her family , avoiding bombs . Her best memory was when they caught a stray cat . It was the only meat they had in ' 44 . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " that if you start a war you really ca n't complain when people drop bombs on you . " <p> " She did n't start it , you did n't start it . . . " Burnside wallowed before an abstraction , and Burnside is not Houdini when it comes to abstractions . <p> He tried to say something more , and failed , but sparked that feeling in me that I somehow knew our final act . <p> " You 're the guy with the gift of gab , " I told him . " Check around . See what 's up while everybody 's still talking . " <p> I had a piece of thinking ahead of me and did n't need help , especially Burnside 's . " Get it right , " I told him , " because we wo n't know what to do until we know what we 've got . The time-line of history is getting a little thin . " <p> Burnside nodded , checked me over to make sure I sat firmly settled , and wheeled away . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derby . <p> III No one recalls the names of dog soldiers who fought beside Leonidas at Thermopylae , or with Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours ; but how they fought , and what they fought for , lives through centuries . Without those forgotten men western civilization could not have come into being . They put it all on the line , because there are times in history when universal evil crawls from its cave of darkness . <p> When those battles happened , though , what did anyone know ? The dog soldier only knew that some fool Persian had it in his head to whip the world , or a Moorish chieftain was on the prod . <p> And the dog soldier stood . He stood between the enemy and home , standing before a way of life that was particularly his . If in his home he was boss during peace , then during war he paid for the honor . The male of the species defends his land and home . It will always be that way . At least that is true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , more certain than the flickering of television . Around me people who had n't spoken to each other since they arrived started talking . Some who never talked at least tried to come from behind a camouflage of silence . <p> There are not enough of us here to make a platoon . We are a small group , and like other forgotten soldiers are about to become a mere dot on the wall map of the past . <p> Yet , the far side charged us to step forward one more once . I asked myself : what did we have to give that could be of any possible use ? If anyone here was rich he would n't be parked at V.A . <p> So what use are we ? Burnside hopes to die exhausted in a cathouse with the sweet-sweet taste of bourbon on his tongue . My own ambition is less raunchy . I want , at age ninety , to be gunned down while storming the Congress . <p> And that , of course , is so much bull . Burnside will die in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remnants of his prostate , he would n't make any kind of show in a brothel , anyway . <p> TV light flickered here and there about the room . TV does n't claim me much , but sometimes I watch light flicker on darkened walls . The rest of our troops face the screen , but I 'm engrossed with flickering . Sometimes it looks like distant shellfire , and sometimes like cities burning . Sometimes , though , greens and blues chase reds away , and walls of the dayroom seem mysterious as haunted woods , or , when yellow happens , like meadows on a spring morning . <p> I watched the flickers , thought of modern times , and it came to me that we 've never stopped fighting . When our wars ceased , a rearguard action began . We fought against deterioration of order ; and lost as an old culture died and society went crazy at the funeral . Yammer got crowned King , with chatter its Queen . <p> At least bull keeps us from becoming maudlin . We do not deify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one here believes in Lawrence Welk or Eisenhower . <p> I watched our troops clam up whenever a member of staff approached . Even Nurse Johnson had trouble getting more than a simple greeting . At the same time , people hard-of-hearing talked confidentially at the top of their voices . In a little while staff would decide that something on TV had driven us nuts , that their personal worlds ran normal ; and they were doing their jobs . Humans , being creative , can rewrite anything . <p> . . . which is a coy way of suggesting that each young generation invents history according to its own bigotries . The rewritten history gets quoted to show that one or another special group has perpetually saved civilization while suffering abuse known only to holy saints . The justification for historians is the same as the justification for janitors . Both sweep up the mess when the public gets done trashing . <p> Nurses and orderlies mingled , picking up a bit here , a bit there . Nurse Johnson acted smarter , which is usual . She hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , and moved like warm music . Nurse Johnson is the best of what remains good about the world . She should work in pediatrics , not a geriatric ward . . . except , I 've already said that , and it is n't true . I suggested it once and she said she prefers geriatrics . What she actually said was , " You guys talk ornery as skunks , but you take care of each other . " Then she said she had already worked in pediatrics , and some people do n't love their children . <p> Nurse Johnson comes to me in dreams and I am young . Curiously , she comes as a long-loved friend , or as a wife of many , many years ; although in the dreams we are both too young for that . Or , she comes like innocence that was once adolescence , of hand-holding in movies , the dark screen flashing images of love or action while hands , not yet fully grown , twine fingers in an ecstasy of investigation ; learning that this  --  this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know about the word " happiness . " <p> I must have dozed off . Old men do that , fall into bemused sleep . Then flaccid muscles cramp , joints scrape like bone against sandpaper , and we awake . Pain is nature 's way of mentioning that pharmaceutical companies enjoy an array of opportunities . <p> The Hour of Charm was underway . Our troops sat pooped , worn , busted and beat from all the excitement . If any mouths yapped they yapped to themselves . If consensus had been reached I had n't heard , and half of these palookas had forgotten it by now . The dayroom sat solidly quiet except for TV . TV spooks discoursed as if believing it meant something . As I came fully awake the main show stood in the windows facing the cemetery . Ghosts no longer impressed me , but this thing did . The figure stood like a hologram of black on deeper black , standing more needful than the king 's ghost in the rampart scene from Hamlet ; and like the ghost of Hamlet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me forward in the time-honored infantryman 's signal to advance . <p> I needed this the way guys in trenches need head lice . At the same time , who could pass up such an opportunity ? I made it to my feet . My walker trembled , although , natch , I walked steady as mountains . The figure in the window waited , and maybe the dayroom stayed bright but darkness rose before me . <p> Something resembling Corporal Harvey stood in irons , like a man foot-bound on a chain gang ; but only Harvey 's eyes told any kind of story . They shone not wild , not crazy , but were great pools of sadness , a sadness portending universal judgment , universal sorrow . Worse , it seemed the figure stood in a steadily increasing wind . <p> That Harvey , who was once so smart , was now mindless , also showed in the eyes . Only sorrow lay there . Intelligence , if it remained , hid inaccessible , remote to Harvey , forgotten by Harvey who now stood as the ghost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ghost must surely be a walking memory . I felt the many memories of darkness surrounding this hospital , this century , the lives and deaths that skip or trample or stumble across time ; and darkness stood before me like a slab of slate . <p> . . . sooner or later one of us had to get brave as well as smart . I edged past the windows and onto the terrace . The terrace seemed normal ; tables , chairs , a long distance view of the city which swelled like a boil between Puget Sound and the Cascade Mountains . From distance came the roar that attends cities , and it pounded and twisted , cooed and pulsed . Light flashed above dark streets , light from skyscrapers , aircraft , and searchlights dancing above used car lots . <p> The cemetery started about fifty yards away , and ran across the face of the hill as ordered as a bank statement . The poor bastards kicking daisies were still lined up in ranks . White slabs shone dazzling in surrounding darkness . I wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gremlins came at night and polished those slabs . <p> Further down , the woods began , and beyond the woods the bridge , park , bandstand ; all broken now , but in the distance still giving the appearance of sanity and order . <p> Darkness stained but did not obscure the landscape . It fell backward as I advanced . Darkness moved slowly , sullen , like an animal on defense but not cowed ; or it moved with calm assurance that my days were short and its patience long . I searched the face of darkness and Harvey was nowhere seen , but I right away saw how Harvey had been snatched . When men die  --  and I nearly have a couple of times  --  they are occupied . Dying is what they 're doing , their job . They do n't pay attention beyond the job , and that happened to Harvey . He was taken while his attention pointed elsewhere . <p> " I try to run a couple months late . That way I avoid the crowds . " Burnside whispered as he wheeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell on our hands . You 'd better take a seat . " It is not like Burnside to whisper . <p> " Something 's coming clear , " I said , and did not know whether I spoke to Burnside or Harvey or darkness . " You can only picture the future based on what you know about the past . If history dies the future can only be hideous . " <p> " I owe my brains to my poetic nature , " Burnside said , " because at least one of us is sensitive . Sit . " <p> I hovered above my walker and regarded darkness . I now knew what it was , but just because you can name a thing does not mean you understand it . <p> " Fan out to my left , " I told him , " like you 're going to flank . " I moved toward the edge of the terrace , where the concrete slab stops and grass begins . Burnside wheeled left , then rolled slowly along the edge . I watched darkness pause , retreat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teenager with a Mauser . It backed five or six yards downhill . " You 're right , " I said to Burnside , " we do have a merry little hell , and a firefight 's in the offing . " I turned , found a chair near the edge of the terrace , sat . Darkness ceased retreating . <p> " Tell me a story , " I said to Burnside . <p> " Nurse Johnson calmed the troops . The kid is a peach . " Burnside looked downhill . In the center of darkness stood mean terrain ; a gentle slope that begged for enfilading fire , a young forest to distribute shell bursts , a rickety bridge crossing a ravine that only a torrential river could love ; and a haunted park . I listened , really listened as Burnside turned factual . For the first time I understood why he made top sergeant in the old Army . <p> " The situation ai n't just tactical , " he said , " it 's strategic . If the damned thing was solid enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of armies , and they 'd move across hemispheres . " <p> " Not that I 'd doubt someone who 's saintly . . . . " <p> Burnside raised a hand to shut me up . " The dayroom has guys who have been everywhere , and it has ghosts from everywhere . This is no crap , Ross . " <p> " How solid is it ? " <p> " That 's the trouble , " Burnside said . " You ca n't lay a glove on it . But , what we 're up against is dark as the inside of a snake , and that 's not a bad picture . It throws coils . " <p> As he talked a theme repeated over and over : darkness cut with flashes . Our men saw Rome and Madrid , Paris and Berlin , London town and Athens . They saw Hong Kong , Sidney , Bora Bora , the Falklands , Murmansk , Tunisia ; and every place looked the same : thundering noise mindless as carnival rides obscured all silence , and fires rose not above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but above mosques , cathedrals , meeting houses , while ceremonial dragons fled before encroaching night . <p> I looked into distance at the city , a dark city cut with flashes . Nurse Johnson lives somewhere in that city . Somewhere , in an apartment with a roommate or a lover or perhaps only a cat , Nurse Johnson irons dresses , fixes dinners , perhaps listens to light rock or jazz . She grows an ivy , or , more likely , a philodendron , and her kitchen curtains are a happy color , red , or orange , or blue with yellow ducks . Beyond the glow of that apartment darkness crouches . Nurse Johnson probably does not know it is there . Or , because she is young , she does not know how fast it can hit and how hard . <p> " You 've been to college , " Burnside said , " so what the hell is happening ? " He rolled back and forth along the edge of the terrace , and he watched his movement cause slow waves in the darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so spill . " <p> I did not know if he meant his Nippon soldier or Nurse Johnson who would be about to go off shift . <p> " You 're a cupcake , " Burnside said to the darkness . " A Nance , a lollipop , a Shirley Temple ; you 're a pint of pup pee , and your ma remains disappointed . . . . " I raised my hand . When Burnside starts on insults it can take a while . He looked at me . " Why are we worked up ? It runs from us . " <p> What to tell him ? Should I tell about the burning of the great library in ancient Alexandria ? <p> " It does n't give a damn one way or other for us , " I told him . " It 's come after what we remember and believe . " Behind us a door swung open . Nurse Johnson , about to go off watch , stepped onto the terrace . <p> She stood silhouetted against darkness , and did not see the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study in determination . Her slight form concentrated on immediate tasks . Her thoughts shaped to tell us goodbye . I wondered how it was for her working in a place where every goodbye might be a last one  --  which is a cliche  --  but around here really true . How often had she said goodbye to a patient , only to come to work next day and find he was dead ? <p> " I saved you gentlemen for last , " she said in a low voice , " so do n't try to snow your girlfriend . Something is happening and it is n't nice . " <p> " Mickey Mouse is only Mickey Mouse , " Burnside told her , his voice grim . " Old Mickey ai n't supposed to be a national hero . " <p> She looked my way . " You 're the one who keeps this guy on a leash . Does he make the least smidgen of sense ? " <p> " He misses South Dakota and the Dust Bowl . Burnside 's turning into a duffer . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it did n't work . . . . " When we talked about Harvey you told me something awful . You were right . " <p> She straightened , looked around , stepped to the edge of the terrace . Darkness pulsed , moved uphill toward her . If Burnside and I did not sit on that terrace , darkness would engulf her . <p> Burnside muttered something about darkness , so low she could not hear , something moderately filthy . <p> " What I tell you stays between us , " I said . " If it gets out we 'll have shrinks and social workers . Our people see ghosts . We see what snatched Harvey . " <p> " And ' scared ' ai n't in it , " Burnside told her . " Our guys feel mean as mange . They 're talking ' fight . ' They 're growing new teeth and toenails . . . one of the curses of being sober . " <p> " I almost do n't believe in ghosts . " <p> She was snaring part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then belief is a leap into reality . If history is a metaphor for ghosts , matters get really serious . <p> " You believe the part about Harvey being snatched . " I watched her and cursed my imagination . The fires of history burn hot and long , but memories of fires do not burn long enough . Nurse Johnson does not know that women and children are always first to be devoured . They do not die by ranks and squads and armies , but helter-skelter , the casual victims of forces headed elsewhere ; forces blowing aside populations like chaff . Nurse Johnson is one strong young woman , and she knows more about suffering than almost anyone else her age . . . and she ai n't seen nothing . <p> " I know what I saw . " Now Nurse Johnson whispered about Harvey . " I have to do something . We ca n't . . . " and she stopped , because she about said " we ca n't have any more getting snatched , " and she about said it while standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip , tried to grin , made a poor show . " You 're right , " she said . " We do n't need social workers . " <p> We had a doomed situation . Nurse Johnson was going to go through her share of pain and sorrow . No way out of it . No way to break it gently . I decided not to break it at all . At the same time , I could n't betray her . " Keep staff off our backs , " I told her . " It 's our problem . " Not true , Nurse Johnson , it 's your problem too . " And if we ca n't handle it we 'll give you a ring . " <p> " You 're really seeing ghosts ? " The nice thing about Nurse Johnson is her ability to stop being a nurse and start being a woman when anything important happens . " You sound okay . " <p> " I wish it was DTs , " Burnside said , " but it ai n't . " <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him almost absent-mindedly . " What are you guys going to do ? " <p> " Fight back , " I told her , and then lied . " I 'm not sure how . Keep staff off our backs . We 'll work it out in a day or so , maybe more . " <p> " You 'll tell me ? " <p> " I will . " What a liar . I 'll tell you after it 's over , Nurse Johnson . News from nowhere . <p> She patted Burnside 's bald head , which made him blush , touched the back of my hand , and left . <p> " Hard to win a war unless you win the battles , " Burnside said . <p> " If we just sit still we 'll get picked off one by one . " <p> " I never made notches on my rifle or my bedpost . Seemed like cheating , somehow . " <p> " Now I know for certain the world is gon na end , " I told him . " You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stand being decent , " Burnside told me , " for as long as we keep it private . Plus , the fickle finger seems to be pointing our way . " I could not tell if he understood what he talked about , or if this was more bull . On some level he knew we had to go into this clean ; no jam on our face . <p> It is a creature of dissolution . It wakes when minds of men become narrow , secular , vengeful ; and at some point it turns foul and crawls among us remembering flames of Inquisition . <p> I spent my working life patrolling the past . Now I patrolled the future . " One more battle , " I told Burnside . <p> " If it makes sense . " <p> " When did any of this crap ever make sense ? " <p> " It ca n't be worse than the Canal . " <p> It could n't be worse than Hill Seven-twenty . I looked across the terrain . Hill Seven-twenty was worse , but the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought of how they banzaied , courageous as madness can make a man , running into the mouths of guns because a politico told them their country was attacked . I wished I had a battalion of them . <p> " I hope , " Burnside said , and not to me  --  his voice tight and not conversational  --  " that being dead has taught you something about soldiering . " <p> His Japanese ghost stood beside him . It 's amazing about kids , whether Nurse Johnson or this kid ; how the best of them can stand rosy with ideals and still firm as duty . This kid 's smooth face was serious as combat , yet his lips did not conceal an excited little smile . I looked him over , thought of his record , and was not sure we wanted him . <p> " Step up to the edge of the grass , " Burnside said . " I wo n't let nothing happen . " <p> The kid stepped forward . Darkness tumbled , reached uphill , but did not manage to advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . <p> " You better stay out of this , " Burnside said . " There 's some real meanness down there . " Burnside rolled forward , his chair side by side with the kid . Darkness did not flee , but it rolled backward at a faster rate . " Runs like a bunny , " Burnside said , " but it do n't run from ghosties . At the same time ghosties help . " He looked up at the kid . " You bringing company ? " <p> The kid pointed his index finger at his chest . Alone . <p> " It do n't pay to be brave and stupid both , " Burnside told the kid . " Think it over . " <p> The kid smiled , then raised a fist without smiling , and then winked out . <p> I watched shadows creep across the terrain . Darkness lay beyond the city , but these shadows were natural darkness which approached with normal things like TV news , and supper , and pills . Hurry sundown . <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flags and such . " <p> I 'm thinking about recruiting posters . . . . " <p> " Even given help , I do n't see us winning . " <p> " You 're right about one thing , " Burnside said , and no bull shone through . " I miss the Dust Bowl . Who would of ever thought ? " <p> " The jarheads seem in pretty good shape . " <p> " I talked to them . They actually turned out right smart . Their brains ai n't never been used for nothing . " As we left the terrace , darkness clustered within approaching night . <p> Among old men , night and day are interchangeable . Night is only dark , and not even that because subdued light illumines the hallways . We wake to think , or wake to pain . Most do not fear death . Our fears are fears of weakness , of peeing your pants , of becoming senile . The crotch and the brain are the engines of history . <p> When I woke I felt slugged . Silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not snore he was in some stage of waking . Beyond our room the dayroom would be swept , polished , silent as mice . The main desk down the hallway would shine like a halo of heaven above the history of this place , the history of a century . . . in Flanders Field where poppies . . . antique clustering of fear and fight . <p> I thought of saying something to Burnside , then thought silence best . As silence became restful ghostland explained itself . Or , at least I understood how some things fit together . <p> The darkness in the dayroom had not been real . It was a message from ghostland about the darkness beyond these walls . The sight of coffins was a warning . The shenanigans of ghosts waving goodbye were also messages , desperate but colorful . The whole show was a hypothetical guidon , a flag , pointing toward foulness that stalked our perimeter . Our ghosts were helpless without us . It seemed that we old men were not only told to protect the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm thinking of the disciplinary barracks at Leavenworth , " Burnside muttered . " Right now it seems like a warm and happy place , real safe and friendly . " <p> He understood most of what we faced . I had halfway hoped he did not , there being no sense in both of us feeling doomed . I decided not to explain about Harvey . <p> " I worry about my great grandkids , " he whispered , and embarrassment almost choked him . " Keep that private . There 's times I think we 're guilty of a teeney bit of b.s . " <p> Had Burnside undergone conversion and become a fledgling saint ? When great grandchildren visited we pretended we were uninterested . We pretended all was well with them . <p> I lay in darkness , mute , without an ounce of tears or sweat , although I needed both . I lay in darkness admitting even I had managed to conceal truth beneath a pile of crap . For old men , Hell comes in two versions , lesser and greater . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expunged , no credit given for ideals or aspirations , nothing bequeathed , all tales revised as the Present , turning , points to a false record and accuses the past for Present suffering . <p> That 's a stern Hell , but the greater version is worse . Hell for old men arrives at that exact moment when we must admit we can no longer protect our kids , our families , our country , the shards and remnants of our love . <p> " I do n't understand why it runs from us . It do n't run from ghosties . " <p> " We have the power of memory . We have the memory of order , and we still have voices . When memory dies civilization dies . " From three or four rooms down the hall , a nurse stepped softly . No , two nurses , because two women murmured . Breeze sighed at the windows . I wondered how many of our people lay awake ; listening , wondering about our worth , unable to show our loves , and , like Burnside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soles moved away , the murmurs quieted . <p> " It 's after a great deal more than us . We 're in the way . " <p> " I do n't mind a scrap , " Burnside said , " but not if it do n't make sense . " " Flags are symbols . Words are symbols . Steeples are symbols . Red lights in front of cathouses are symbols . The world do n't know it , but the world lives by symbols , some good , some as had as flags . " <p> " Dead guys do n't drive wheelchairs . There 's got to be advantages . " <p> He had never talked about being crippled , except to make a joke . I thought of the tedium , of the many days and years in that chair , of the iron a man has to have in heart and soul in order to face each morning . <p> " I got to pee , and I was never one to favor bedpans , " Burnside said , no longer muttering . " See you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , a shadow in the darkened room ; the last time I saw him alive , and all I really saw was a shadow . <p> Oh , Nurse Johnson , you do n't know how fast it can hit , and how hard . <p> I dozed , waked , fretted , dozed , then came fully awake with the rough knowledge that Burnside would not make roll call . AWOL from the V.A . Silent halls filled with echoes , voices of fear and hope . Somewhere in darkness Burnside made his move , and voices of the past sent whispers into that same darkness . Whispers sped like hushed and urgent messengers patrolling against a silent-walking enemy . Ghostland seemed poised for either success or disaster , and with nothing in between . Outside , in darkness , a storm rose on Shakespearian wings . Black feathers of storm rode gusts tumultuous as passion . Darkness surrounded , clasped ; a coffin of wind and rain in which a man becomes breathless and shroud-wrapped . <p> I sat on the edge of my bed , cussing Burnside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat with despair of a kind known only during times of total wreckage . Helpless to act , to change matters , helpless  --  but , I told myself  --  not doomed . Not without a fight . Meanwhile echoes sighed and whispers moved through hallways . <p> I stood , already heavy with grief , and made my way to a window ; opened it and listened . Rain rode cold gusts blowing off salt water . Rain hammered on leaves of trees , and water gurgled in drains . Rain pelted its ancient song , and the lyrics of that song say " May God have pity on the infantry . " <p> Behind me sounded a rustle of clothing , and the pad of soft-soled shoes . An orderly stood , breathing hard . I had been unable to find tears earlier . I had them now . I did not turn . <p> " Where ? " the guy said , and said it rough ; a guy who already knew his tail was in a sling . No " yes sir , " " no sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell . " <p> " Mind your manners . " I still did not turn . My voice choked only a little . <p> " Him and them two candy-asses , " the guy said . " I 'll settle with you later . " He hoofed it , almost running . <p> " You win the first round . " I spoke into the rain and dark , speaking to Burnside wherever he was . " All Hell is about to break . What you need , pal , is a miracle ; you and your damn Marines . " <p> I turned , headed for the dayroom toward people of my own kind . Grief is easier when tough-minded folk stand together and do n't kid themselves about the odds . <p> Burnside needed a miracle , okay , but what he got was television . Search parties spread from the hospital , people  --  scared mostly for their jobs  --  bundled against rain . Headlights cruised the road , and police spotlights flicked through shrubbery as dawn rose gray and cold above the scene . No searchers imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't in them to imagine . They figured he went to town , or , like a senility case , wandered in a fog toward pretty lights and racket . As day broke , and in spite of attempts to keep a lid on the mess , somebody tipped the television . A traffic helicopter churned its course across the backside of the hill ; one bumfoozled way to make the morning news . <p> The three lay on muddy ground pounded by northwest rain . A camera reported bodies like bundles of soaked rags , small , sprawled , distorted ; and although news anchors knew nothing of combat , even they pretended to be impressed . The bodies lay fanned across the lower hill . Burnside made it to the bridge , actually had one hand touching the bridge , but did not get onto the bridge . Burnside lay as small and raggedy as any other dead soldier . No angels sang . A Marine sergeant lay just below the treeline , the body tangled in that awkward shape of corpses that have suffered breaks and fractures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A torn Japanese battle flag tangled in brush within the treeline , hanging like a spot of blood and not a spot of sun ; the kid a beautiful kid , but no Samurai . <p> The man at the ravine still lived , but had become insane ; his mind and hands clawed back up the hill , his body weak , powerless to save itself . When medics brought him in he still clawed at air , fingers hooked , his voice gone from screaming . <p> We patients looked at each other , muttered , shook our heads . TV showed bodies hauled out by chopper . The Marine lay lumped beneath a sheet , his knees tucked up ; stiffened , probably broken . Burnside , with no legs to speak of , made a lump under the sheet like a muffin or a dumpling . <p> Patients did not have everything figured , but knew enough to wonder how Burnside got euchred , or how he screwed up . Orderlies watched us as if we were kids on a playground , while we thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find who was guilty . Staff did not believe three old men  --  one a cripple  --  could go two hundred yards downhill without help . Staff blamed each other , dug political foxholes , dodged responsibility . <p> As this went on , doctors squared shoulders like little men and blamed everyone , patient and staff alike , for betraying some high purpose known only to does . And , when Nurse Johnson came on shift , she took the brunt . Staff blamed the day shift for not giving some warning imagined only by the night shift , and Nurse Johnson was lead nurse on the day shift . <p> " At least , " one little prick said to her , " We 're rid of your main trouble maker . " The punk had bad teeth , a manicure , and he smelled the way he looked ; which is to say " floral . " <p> Nurse Johnson did not answer . Nurse Johnson looked to her patients . <p> " Good riddance , " another said . " Caused me nothing but trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This guy looked like he spent most of his time trimming hair from other people 's noses . <p> Nurse Johnson asked no question . Her form was stiff , her face controlled . Unless you knew her well , you could not spot her confusion . <p> No one but we geriatrics could understand why those guys went out like that . And we , by God , were not about to enlighten . The farside joined us , and every mother 's son and daughter on that ward felt more in tune with the dead than with the live theater that quacked and moaned around us . <p> All through the morning hours spirits of men and women appeared with stony faces , and there were no antics . Burnside lost . It might well be that our last chance was lost . A sense of tiredness , a sense of doom , rode darkly through ghostland . The farside still had feelings , because it did what we were doing ; which is to say it hid them . A few women wept , and one Japanese woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name was Yukiko perhaps she wept for Burnside . More likely she wept for the kid . I did n't want to know . <p> And if everybody felt guilty , or felt anger at being trumped , I had them beat . I had not told Burnside about Harvey . At the time I did not want enemy more dark and dangerous than even he believed . I screwed up . I should have told him . Should have . <p> On the other hand , he was the guy who jumped offsides . I had figured we 'd use another day for organization , planning ; and then Burnside goes in like a kamakazi , or the Lone Ranger : That one figured easy , and to each his own . <p> I would have slowed them up . Either that , or Burnside tried to keep me from walking into it . I think the first , because the man knew how to soldier . If he could have found more guys who could keep up he would have waited . <p> During the Hour of Charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their people mighty frail , two Wacs , both tough little princesses , one fused spine , three mental blanks who drooled , two bedridden , one goldbrick , two mobile but getting over operations , a bosun mate with one arm and an appliance instead of a hand , and a blind quartermaster . . . the bosun mate looked pretty good , the blind guy did n't look too bad . I took myself to the terrace to think . <p> The terrain lay unchanged . The broken bridge still stood . The broken bandstand in the park remained . I wondered if Burnside had had an objective , or if he just drove the enemy ahead of him until he dropped . The whole business lay ringed with mystery , with improbabilities , but also with certainty of total destruction if we failed . There might be total destruction if we succeeded , but that was someone else 's problem . We could only set the standard , write our last will and testament through action , and hope someone could still read deeply enough to raise arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , reaching into the normal light of late afternoon ; and it stretched toward the little park but did not enter . The bandstand stood empty in mixed sunlight . Some remnant of battle must remain , something halting an advance . The ghost of a ghost may be more than a memory . It may be a piece of history that refuses to be rewritten . <p> Maybe something was still left of those men . Maybe something was even still left of Harvey . Maybe Burnside had not completely failed . One thing was certain . I had very few hours to screw around . <p> After a battle there 's a time that lies in between , a time of pause after bodies are collected , buried , or shipped . A vacuum exists between actions . The enemy does not yet arrive although the population may flee . It serves as respite , but it 's not a good time for long range plans , or being born . <p> It might be possible to get as far as the park , to establish a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already absorbed the initial licking . The whole business was one of symbols , without which we can not live . Symbols of evil abound . The world needed that symbol of order , a small Victorian park . Maybe the world would not avoid final darkness , anyway , but we could offer the world a chance . <p> We own the power of memory , and the memory of order . . . a door opened quietly behind me . Nurse Johnson , of course . A good kid in a bad world . Her footsteps sounded hushed across the terrace . She remained silent at first , standing beside me and looking at the terrain . The world went quiet . I could hear her breathing , practically hear her pulse . <p> " He was in a wheelchair , " she whispered . <p> " He angled back and forth across the hill . When he got to the woods he dropped out of the chair and did body-rolls . Where he could n't roll he used an infantryman 's crawl . You do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Silence returned . She did not blame me . She is not like most other people . She does n't see her patients , or her neighbors , as problems . She 's old-fashioned enough to grant room without a lot of explanations . <p> " They must have had reasons . " <p> " If I explain , " I told her , " it wo n't mean anything . It has to be discovered . " <p> " I miss him badly . I miss all of them , but he was so ornery . Suppose I have to miss you too ? " <p> From inside the ward , but faintly , some guy sang tuneless as a bluejay . . . " I 'll be seeing you . . . " Sure , buddy , of course , right , you bet . Nurse Johnson 's face came alert as a new mother hearing her baby squall . " You 're too good for this place , " I told her . " You should n't have to worry about a bunch of worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shush me . The guy stopped singing . <p> " I do n't want to lose any more of you . " Her voice remained hushed . Slabs in the cemetery glowed beneath streaks of sun . A flag , that in other days you did n't have to be ashamed of , hung limp . <p> " I make no promises because I ca n't , " I told her . " We may be playing out a script written half a century ago . "  --  More than that , Nurse Johnson , because it may go back to WWI.  --  I thought of all the courageous people I 've known through the years . " I do n't know why anyone would want to be a nurse , " I told her . " I 'm glad you are . " <p> " Why would anybody want to be a soldier ? " Her voice sounded husky . She controlled tears . <p> She does n't know anything about Thermopylae . She is vague about the Battle of Britain . " There 's blessed few who want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things happen . " I felt a presence at my side , caught a glimmer of white in the corner of my eye . I did n't even need to turn in order to know that my Korean patriarchs were there , all five of them , three with staffs and two with those silly damn squirrel rifles . <p> " I have to do my job , " she said , and it was obvious she did n't see my Koreans . " I figure you 're going to try another heist . " She showed more sadness than I 've ever seen , even from her . " This place used to worry about what was good or bad . I ca n't be here every minute . " <p> " Burnside was crazy about you , " I told her , and that was the truth . Then I told a lie , but one that seemed fitting . " You 're the only woman who ever made Burnside blush . " <p> " I 'm not above a little flirting . " She tried to smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it do n't cost a red cent . " Then for a little while she wept . <p> I wanted to touch her hand , tell her it was okay , say how much her toughness and honesty meant . I wanted to say a whole lot of things ; but of course there are things you should n't do , even if you could . <p> IV Hours passed . I hobbled here and there , lining up the action  --  old folks at home  --  supper came and went . I talked to Quartermaster Wilson , a good man and surprisingly sane . When a guy has been blind these fifty years you do n't expect his brain to amount to much . Wilson figures he has precious little to lose , and it may feel good to be needed . TV bubbled around us , and evening news forgot Burnside in its pursuit of a new sensation ; fornication between politicians and lady trust officers . I talked to Bosun Tilton who will lead us , because for this job we need legs , not hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of history , with scenes of sense and order . <p> Meanwhile , the ward remains tranquil on its face . The two Wacs hold court , and the b.s. level rises and shifts in their direction . . . a couple of real cute tale spinners , real purveyors , and who would 've ever thought ? The girls have set up a deal with the wheelchair guys , and the girls are conning staff out of its collective drawers . The Wacs are spellbinders , and our guys gather round them . Staff eases off , relaxes , sees things as normal , lets down its guard . Our people seem curiously free , some for the first time in their lives , and even the senility cases are more or less in touch . Light flickers against walls , red and black like cities burning , but the ward sits busy planning while pain comes to the evening Neilsens . Our troops set about using their last resource , their helplessness , to provide cover . <p> And ghostland surrounds . And ghostland remains voiceless . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or maybe grateful for just being remembered . We have Japanese here , a few Germans . We have Africans from Kraut rubber plantations , and native coast watchers from the islands . We have mule skinners from the Burma Road , and resistance people , French and Greek and Eyetye , Dutch and Norwegians and Belgians ; Russian and Polish horsemen . <p> And nobody brings a flag . We have Laps and Turks , Brits and Aussies ; Waltzing Matilda . Music runs more faintly than echoes . We hear few marches , mostly ballads . <p> And soon it will be time to go . And if anyone hears this tape it may mean that you still have a little time . It may mean that one of us got through . <p> I come to the terrace , watch the night , and muse . <p> Across the terrain light swirls as faces of Hell appear , the Twentieth century condensing in a way that would make jealous the good folk at Reader 's Digest . . . this blood-saturated century . <p> As if on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving like a tilted triangle , squashing trenches and barbed wire . The first machine gun speaks , and the first airplane engine revs and purrs , spits and pops . In the background the first radio quacks about 1920 's sex scandals while selling chewing gum and snake oil . Napalm flares from later wars and the Victory V hangs like a checkmark above blown bridges , shattered cathedrals , smouldering rings of fire where once stood huts of thatch . <p> And the message says that , unless it is stopped right now , it all begins again ; the old hatreds , the egos rampant , the fists raised proclaiming that one or another god grants the right to yell instead of think . The message says that each time the world forgets how Evil exists , Evil gets a resurrection ; and the word " honor , " extinguishing , turns to smoke . <p> But there once lived men who knew that some things were worth dying for . There once were women who fought for their own , and fought for others as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body is no big advantage , anyway , and so this is how it shapes : we ca n't form the future but we can show responsibility . <p> We 'll not exactly perambulate singing , but we 're going to go , a bunch of old men , some weak from operations ; one blind with strong legs , one with eyes who can guide while leaning on the blind , another with a pincher for a hand ; old men led or followed by ghosts of former allies and enemies fanning downhill against a void . It needs only one of us to get across that bridge in order to establish a presence , and we go with little hope of rescue ; not of Burnside , or Harvey , or of ourselves . Nobody here weighs much more than an angel . We suppose the bridge will hold . <p> And the comrades we leave behind , and the girls we leave behind will form our cover . The two Wacs plan a ruckus just before dawn . The wheelchair guys will feign seizures . Staff will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as silent as the farside , as silent as memory , with smallest hope of helping fallen comrades , but with no farewells and no apologies , as the farside weeps ; as even ghostland waves goodbye . <p> This story is for Wesley Baker , Bill Deen , lira Hall , Don Farmer , Fran Ross and Mieko Riggleman . <p> The tale of the five Korean patriarchs is adapted from The Last Campaign by Glen Ross , Harper &; Bros. , 1962 . <p> The phrase " shiranu ga hotoke " does not mean " aw screw it " as reported . It translates : " The buddha is dead , " and it is used by the Japanese when something incredibly stupid or vulgar has happened . <p> <p> <p> By Jack Cady <p>
