<p> An angry Florida sun has just cleared the tree line over the right field wall and fresh from the Baltimore Orioles team bus , Cal Ripken Jr . squints hard into the new morning as the sweat begins to bubble across his forehead . There is more forehead to work with this spring , his pearl-gray hairline in a noble retreat , as might suit a 34- year-old man who has done nothing but try hard all his life . The dime- sized blisters on his palms give him away as a ballplayer , for the rest of him could be . . . anyone . Mason . Cop . Maybe a teacher . <p> But instead , this year Ripken will become a full-fledged legend . Something he says he never intended to do - set the record for most consecutive games played : 2,131 - will belong to him come early September . This is a record had been considered unbreakable since being set by saintly Lou Gehrig more than 50 years ago . <p> Regular shortstops do not last a decade and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work equipped only with a fidelity to the game and a baseball family 's perseverence may be as remarkable as the streak itself . That he is overtaking the great Gehrig in the midst of the game 's worst image disaster since the Black Sox Scandal is rich too , a gentleman posed to restore something to the game he loves . Or something like that . <p> " You 're asking me to be philosophical in a way , are n't you ? " he asked , for just a moment considering fate . " I do n't know . " <p> This season will grow ripe with Ripken 's bashfulness , his modesty , his unwillingness to view himself in baseball 's ancient context . He says he refrains from thinking about himself to maintain his shortstop 's perspective , to prepare for each game . So it may be useful to go back to 1983 , when the streak was in just its second season . For then , a younger shortstop said , " I want people to think of me as an iron man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season , but there have been times when it 's been tough mentally . You get tired of thinking , tired of concentrating . And then as you pop up or strike out , you say , ' How did I do that ? I was n't even thinking . ' " <p> A thinking man 's shortstop <p> Aspiring to be an iron man , Ripken first worried about the thinking , what it might take to concentrate for six Orioles managers , through three presidential administrations , building a batting cage , gym and weight room at his home so he could perhaps concentrate a little harder . During the streak , Ripken has left a game before the seventh inning only four times , three of those coming in the last game of a season . No shortstop has hit more home runs ( 310 ) . He has maintained a higher fielding average ( .979 ) than any shortstop in the Hall of Fame . Beyond that , though , Ripken 's ultimate accomplishment may be his thinking , for no man performs perpetually unless he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't set out to do this , " he said . " I do n't think anyone makes a conscious effort to go out and play in all these games . If you were to ask me 15 years ago if it was even conceivable , I 'd say no . But for whatever reason , you go out there and you 're able to play and you 're able to contribute and convince yourself that you can play an entire season . To me , I downplay the accomplishment . People say , ' It 's 2,000 games . ' I say , well , you can only play as many games as there are in a season . Then you get three or four months off . " <p> The Orioles were in the middle of a doubleheader against Toronto May 29 , 1982 , when Earl Weaver , still in his first of two stints as Baltimore manager , started Floyd Rayford ahead of Ripken at third base . At 6-foot- 4 , Ripken was perceived as too tall for shortstop ( he is the tallest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Weaver returned him to the lineup the next day , and Ripken made 27 straight starts at third until July 1 , when Weaver gave in and moved him to shortstop for keeps . <p> Just a few close calls <p> In a blur of unreal numbers , he did not miss an inning for over 4 1/2 years . Only once in his 16 seasons did Gehrig play every inning . Ripken has left 58 games before completion during the streak ( twice he was ejected in the first inning , both times for arguing strike calls ) , while Gehrig left early in 69 games . During the Ripken streak , the game 's other 27 clubs have started a total of 321 shortstops . While he has played through , major leaguers have been placed on the disabled list a total of 3,372 times . <p> His body has been extraordinary . Ripken badly sprained his left ankle during a 1985 pickoff play against Texas ( Game 444 ) but missed only an exhibition against the Naval Academy the following day . In 1992 , he sprained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Game 1,713 ) but did n't miss an inning for another week . Then two years ago , he turned his right knee while wading into a fight with Seattle ( Game 1,790 ) and came the closest he 's ever come to sitting out the next day . But he took an entire infield practice and played through . <p> Much of this is due to conditioning , but almost as much is from a willingness to put pain aside . And this ability originated from Cal Ripken Sr. , the career baseball man , 14 years a minor league coach and a catcher before that in an era when equipment was more pain than protection . Brother Billy Ripken recalls watching his father take a power drill straight through a toenail - in the family bathroom - to relieve the pressure from a blood bruise under the nail . When one of his four kids took a knock , the old catcher would say " You 'll feel better before it stops hurting , " and then move on . <p> " He ran instructional leagues , he opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Cal Jr . " I mean , he did pretty much everything , and spent a huge amount of time in teaching and working . So that work ethic and how he felt about baseball and how he felt about putting on the uniform , that all translated early to me , just the passion he has for it . " <p> Hero to the players union <p> And the modesty as well . Ripken speaks with difficulty about all this , downplaying most of it . He became a hero among the players union during the strike for his willingness to surrender the streak if it meant he would have to play with replacements . Said Boston 's Mo Vaughn , " If Cal Ripken can sit , then I can sit . " <p> Throughout his career , Ripken has pledged to approach every game the way he did when the streak started . Because knowing about Gehrig and what he did might interfere with that , Ripken stores the articles and books fans have sent him so he might study them afterward . For now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I do n't deny people their feelings about it and their ability to relate to it , " he said , " because it could be they relate to it as a matter of persistence , stubbornness , showing up for work every day or feeling so strongly about your work or your job or anything . I think that 's all great . <p> " For me , it 's just I have a love for baseball , and I want to be in the lineup , and that 's what I was taught , and that 's what it is . I try to keep it simple and try not to understand what it means to everybody else or what it means to the game . I just try to continue to do what I do . " <p> The record , barring rainouts , should come Sept. 5 or 6 against California in Baltimore , where Ripken remembers seeing his first game when he was 6 . <p> " I 'd pay to get in , " said Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina . " Everyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games in a row can appreciate what he 's going to do . It does n't just take a toll on your body . It takes a toll on your mind . But he 's done it for 13 years . It 's incredible . " <p> A creature of his routines , this year stretches out before Ripken unlike the first 13 , an imposing course crammed with distractions and public attention . Perhaps no other two things in life conflict as much with Cal Ripken Jr . ' s method . And sweating hard now in the spring sun , the everyday shortstop wonders where his endless season might lead him next . <p> " I do n't know how it 's going to play out and I do n't know how I 'm going to handle it when it does play out , " he said . " I know one thing : I 'm really going to be conscious of the fact that I 'm an everyday baseball player and I want to approach the game in the same way . Anyone has any other suggestions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take them .
