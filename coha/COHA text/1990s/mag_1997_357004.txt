In strictly private negotiations , there is really no point in striking dramatic poses and demanding the impossible . So in recent communications with the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat did n't do any posturing and did n't ask Netanyahu to cancel his plan to build Har Homa , a new Jewish settlement in mostly Arab East Jerusalem . Instead , Arafat settled for the art of the possible : he requested that Netanyahu put the project on hold , maybe for six months or so , to allow Palestinian and Israeli negotiators to nudge the stymied peace process forward . Earlier this month Netanyahu agreed . He informed Arafat that he would temporarily stop work on the 6,500 apartments on the hill the Arabs call Jabal Abu Ghneim . Just how long would this diplomatic pause last ? Five days . Even God needed six days to create the earth . " It seemed like a silly joke , " says an American official , " only it was true .
