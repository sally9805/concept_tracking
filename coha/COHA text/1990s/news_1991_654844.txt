<p> SOUTH Chicago 's backyard would hardly seem worth protecting . It 's already choked with rusting scrapyards , sprawling coal heaps , grimy steel mills , and garbage dumps . But snuggled among these blights is a toxic-waste incinerator - and that 's where nearby residents would like to draw the line . <p> Whatever the outcome in Chicago , incineration of toxic waste in the United States appears certain to increase . Chemical Waste Management Inc . ( CWM ) , the giant of the toxics disposal industry , sees an increasingly important role for incineration during the 1990s . <p> One reason is the government-mandated cleanup of Superfund sites - abandoned toxic-waste dumps . Only 63 of 1,187 high-priority sites have been reclaimed under the 10-year-old program . The US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has called incineration the " best demonstrated available technology . " <p> A second reason is the 1 trillion pounds of new toxic waste that US industry generates each year , according to estimates by the EPA , which permits fewer and fewer kinds of waste to be buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste into incineration , " notes Peter Daley , chief of research and development at CWM . " That will probably continue for the foreseeable future . " <p> CWM owns the Chicago incinerator , one of 17 in the US that accepts waste from government agencies and private industry for destruction . Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ) , the facility must destroy 99.99 percent of input hazardous waste . <p> In addition , the incinerator is one of only four that is entitled to destroy polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) . The Toxic Substances Control Act ( TSCA ) requires that PCB destruction be 99.9999 percent effective . <p> Visitors who brave the rutted dirt road leading past a mammoth landfill to the CWM incinerator are shown a six-minute video about the facility titled " Safely Destroying Hazardous Waste . " Opponents scoff . <p> They object in part to CWM itself , which is 76 percent owned by Waste Management Inc. of Oak Brook , Ill . State Rep. Clem Balanoff , a leading foe , describes CWM 's attitude as " cavalier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $6.3 million in fines paid under consent decrees . Regulators turned down the facility 's application for a permanent operating license in 1989 , but allowed it to continue operating while it appealed . In February , though , the incinerator was knocked out of action when the operators burned a chemical they did n't know was explosive . <p> CWM spokesman Bernard Hanley says the company forced some employees to resign over the data violations , which occurred in 1986 and 1987 . It also increased the number of personnel and amount of training . <p> As to the explosion , Mr. Hanley says , the company is revising procedures and seeking more informative manuals on the properties of chemicals . <p> But CWM ca n't do anything about the fact that " all hazardous-waste incinerators emit some of the waste that is fed to them to the air , " asserts Joe Thorton , a research analyst with Greenpeace 's campaign to halt the practice . RCRA and TSCA emissions standards notwithstanding , the EPA 's science advisory board estimates that 1 percent of the chemicals put into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And the incineration process forms and releases new chemicals like dioxin , Mr. Thorton adds . " In many cases those chemicals are more toxic than the original waste . " <p> Partly incinerated compounds , counters Hanley of CWM , " present no real problem or health hazard here . What we 're doing here is not a threat to health . " <p> He , too , cites EPA data . A 1989 study attributed 0.1 percent of the emission of known carcinogens into south Chicago 's air to waste-disposal facilities of all types . Steel mills accounted for 33.7 percent and vehicle traffic 13.9 percent . <p> The debate over incineration led Congress to require the EPA to help commercialize alternative technologies . The agency 's Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation ( SITE ) program currently has 56 participants demonstrating processes like membrane microfiltration , freezing separation , in-situ vitrification , and infrared thermal destruction . <p> Dr. Daley of CWM says any new technology must be versatile - that is , effective in enough situations to be worth the cost of development . It must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it must n't create new problems to solve . <p> CWM is a SITE participant . The company 's X*TRAX process will be used this summer at a Superfund project in North Dartmouth , Mass . Contaminated soil will be dug up and baked in a portable kiln , where released toxics can be captured for later incineration . Cleansed soil removed from the kiln will be put back on the site . <p> Since a ton of contaminated soil might contain only 100 grams of PCBs , the X*TRAX process should be 30 to 50 percent cheaper than conventional incineration of soil and all , Daley says . <p> Eleven of the SITE projects involve bioremediation , the use of bacteria to break down hazardous chemicals . Numerous universities also are researching the subject . <p> Bruce Rittmann , a professor of civil engineering at the University of Illinois , cites estimates that bioremediation could grow to a $500 million annual business by the year 2000 , up from $100 million last year . A separate study calculated the overall toxic remediation and disposal business could be worth $23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . Dr. Rittmann is working to develop computer models that would enable the bioremediation process to be optimized . <p> The EPA has generated some excitement over the accidental discovery that PCBs seem to vanish when mixed with quicklime . Other scientists have duplicated the EPA 's results , although Daley says CWM was unable to . <p> Thorton of Greenpeace says the best solution would be not to generate toxic waste in the first place . <p> Industrial companies could make reductions , he believes , but he doubts that they will make the needed investments as long as incineration offers them a " liability-free escape " from the toxic wastes they generate .
