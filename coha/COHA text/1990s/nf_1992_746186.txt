A computerized block design task was developed which records temporal and nontemporal measures of performance . This study evaluates the reliability of the measures and reports their intercorrelations . With one exception , the measures showed moderate to good reliability . The results indicate that increasing the difficulyv of the task and testing a more diverse sample may be necessary for improved reliability . A nontemporal method of scoring a block-design task would be useful when testing persons who have handicaps affecting motor skills . but no central nervous system deficits . <p> Previous research has demonstrated that college undergraduates have little difficulty adapting to a computerized block design task . Temporal performance on the computerized task has a reliability coefficient similar to the Block Design subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised ( WAIS-R ) , and is moderately correlated with temporal performance on that subtest ( Martin &; Wilcox , 1989 ; Wechsler , 1981 ) . <p> Tasks of this type assess analysis of visual patterns , visual-spatial manipulation , and synthesis of visual patterns . However , they are also affected by psychomotor speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1988 ) and return artificially low scores for persons who are motorically slow , yet retain good visual-spatial skills . In large part , this bias is attributable to the importance of temporal measures in conventional scoring methods . <p> In the interest of developing a method of scoring a block-design task that is unaffected by psychomotor speed , the present study investigates a nontemporal approach to measuring block design performance . The study examines the reliability of three nontemporal measures , and explores the relationship of temporal and nontemporal measures of performance on the computerized block design task . METHOD <p> Subjects <p> Subjects were 53 undergraduates attending a small comprehensive university who volunteered to take part in the study to receive extra credit in their introductory course in psychology . Of 53 subjects , 43 were female and 10 were male . Another five subjects were tested , but excluded from the data analysis because their knuckles inadvertently hit the " finished " button , prematurely ending a trial . <p> Apparatus <p> Software to control stimulus presentation and data collection was written in HyperTalk , the scripting language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The software was run on a Macintosh SE personal computer equipped with one megabyte of RAM , two internal 800K floppy disk drives , a CMS SD43 external hard drive , and a Mac'n Touch touch screen from MicroTouch Systems . <p> The software creates screen displays of the type shown in Figure 1 . The upper left part of the screen is occupied by a stimulus design , and the upper right portion of the screen contains a response area . In the lower center of the screen is a single block which may be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise by touching the adjacent curved arrows . Touching the small white block at the bottom of the screen makes the larger block white , touching the black one changes it to black , and touching the small white and black block has the effect of changing the pattern of the larger block to black and white . <p> A copy of the stimulus design can be constructed by choosing the block pattern and rotation one wishes to place in the duplicate design , touching one of the nine gray boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that section of the duplicate design , and repeating the process until all nine blocks are in place . Errors may be corrected by choosing another block and copying it into the same section of the duplicate design . <p> Procedure <p> Subjects were seated in front of the computer , and instructed in the use of the touch screen to choose and rotate the block on the screen . Subjects then practiced manipulating the block . They were next shown a nine-block practice design . The experimenter demonstrated the use of the touch screen to copy the design , cleared the response area , and allowed subjects to practice building the design . When they finished the practice design , the testing session began . <p> Each testing session consisted of 10 designs of varying difficulty which were presented in random order . Subjects had unlimited time to complete each design ; they indicated they had completed a design by touching the button on the screen labeled " finished . " The computer stored data reflecting the accuracy of the design they constructed , the time taken to complete it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touches outside the response area . When all designs had been completed , the subject was debriefed . After the subject left the laboratory ? the data were printed and stored on disk . RESULTS <p> The measures of performance used in this study were response time , manipulations , moves , and correct completions . Response time represents the mean number of seconds that elapsed from the time a stimulus pattern was first displayed until subjects touched the " finished " button . The term manipulations refers to the number of screen touches per trial outside the constructed design ; moves are screen touches per trial within the constructed design . Correct completions are the number of designs accurately reproduced per subject . Descriptive data for each are displayed in Table 1 . Coeffecient alpha was calculated as an estimate of internal consistency for each measure ; the results are also displayed in Table 1 . The correlation matrix in Table 2 portrays the relationship of the variables to one another . DISCUSSION <p> Measures of block design performance , except correct completions , show moderate to good reliability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the range of some nontemporal measures is restricted by ceiling or floor effects . Since nine moves are required to complete each design , the mean of 11.88 indicates that subjects on average made fewer than three errors of placement per design . The correct completion rate of 98.5% also represents a substantial ceiling effect . This suggests that reliability of the nontemporal measures could be increased if the difficulty of the task was raised to the point at which subjects made more errors when building designs , and failed to accurately reproduce some designs . <p> Increased reliability might conceivably be achieved by increasing the number of blocks per design , increasing the complexity of stimulus patterns , or requiring subjects to construct a rotation or mirror image of the stimulus design . One may also assume a sample of college undergraduates represents a notable restriction of range by comparison to the standardization sample of a test such as the WAIS-R ; testing a more diverse sample would undoubtedly bolster the reliability of the weaker measures . <p> If the reliability of nontemporal measures of performance on this block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they may hold promise as measures of visual-spatial skills for persons whose motor skills are impaired by pathology of the peripheral nervous system or other handicapping conditions , but have no central deficits . In addition , the consistency and ease of administration inherent in computerized tests suggest that this task may have utility for the general population as well . <p>
