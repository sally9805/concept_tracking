John Lee Hooker does n't just sing the blues , and he does n't just play the blues on his guitar . He is the blues . Along with a handful of American musicians , such as Robert Johnson , B.B. King , Bessie Smith and a few others , Hooker helped establish in the cultural imagination what being a blues performer is all about . When Hooker sings , it 's with an ocean-deep voice that grumbles and growls and sometimes soothes ; his guitar playing has a wise , twangy authority . <P> Hooker is fond of using collaborators to enliven his music  --  also , no doubt , to broaden his audience  --  and on his new album , Do n't Look Back , he 's chosen his partners deftly . The band Los Lobos backs Hooker on a virile version of Hooker 's classic song Dimples , and Irish pop star Van Morrison contributes some cagey vocals on the aching ballad The Healing Game ( Morrison also produced the album ) . <P> Do n't Look Back is a good album but not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't No Big Thing tend to drag . But there are moments of dark , understated glory here that make you forgive the occasional missteps . The title track is the headiest moment ; when Hooker sings , " I 'm gon na live for the future/ not the past , " using that rumbling , Richter-scale voice to toss off decades of heartbreak , the listener is touched with a redemptive awe . Hooker is 79 years old now , and has all but stopped touring . " I 'll go out once in a while , " he says . " I 've paid my dues . " Paid in full . Just one spin of Do n't Look Back should convince anyone of that . <P>  --  By Christopher John Farley
