Fledgling Prime Minister John Major could be forgiven for expecting his Conservative Party to seek a little harmony after the internal revolt that ousted Margaret Thatcher . No such luck . <P> Some Tories in the genteel spa town of Cheltenham staged a rebellion when they discovered that the candidate designated to run in the next general election is black . A local party member , Bill Galbraith , reportedly described nominee John Taylor , 38 , a lawyer and a former government adviser on race relations , as " a bloody nigger . " Others claimed that the nomination had been " bulldozed " through by a national party eager to elect its first nonwhite representative since 1906 . <P> The party and local leadership promptly condemned the racist slurs and rallied around Taylor . But having promised upon his election to build " a country that is at ease with itself , " Major was reminded by the Cheltenham rebels just how hard that task is going to be .                 @ @ @ @
