DOCTOR , DOCTOR , GIVE US THE news ! <P> The clamor for decent , affordable health care has reached a fever pitch . President-elect Bill Clinton , who won plenty of votes by promising that he would work to deliver such a system , is now under heavy pressure to deliver on his pledge within the first 100 days . As he prepares to take office , the problems with America 's health-system have reached a critical condition . Medical costs have begun to accelerate at an even faster pace than was expected . More and more employers , unable or unwilling to shoulder the financial burden any longer , are canceling or slashing benefit plans . Millions more Americans are learning that they simply can no longer afford basic medical care . <P> The crisis is distorting the shape of the U.S. economy . The Commerce Department reported last week that health-care costs climbed 12% in 1991 , to $838.5 billion , at a pace four times the rate of overall inflation . Medical bills now account for 14% of the entire American economy , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expected to top $1 trillion by the year 2000 , seems likely to hit that level as early as next year . <P> Employers , who provide coverage for 85% of their workers , are staggering under the costs . Among the hardest hit are industrial giants , which support millions of aging retirees , whose medical bills far exceed those of younger people . Ford Motor , for example , was compelled to make a fourth-quarter write- off of $7.5 billion to account for the costs of providing medical coverage + for its retirees , a blow that will probably force the automaker to report the largest annual loss ( nearly $7 billion ) ever suffered by a U.S. corporation . AT &T; expects to take a similar write-off this year , and General Motors , with far more retirees , may face a catastrophic deficit when it finally takes the health-care hit . <P> Insurers are also suffocating . New York State 's vast Empire Blue Cross-Blue Shield plan , which insures 1.4 million mostly poor and elderly patients , temporarily averted insolvency this month thanks to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infusion , though , customers will face average rate increases of 20% . As a result , hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers may be forced to join the ranks of the uninsured . <P> Some of Clinton 's advisers are urging him to re-evaluate the health-care- reform package that he promised to unveil as one of his first major initiatives . To cope with the price inflation , Clinton must decide how he can reconcile his aim of expanding coverage while curbing costs . Any plan that could achieve both of those goals , however admirable , would require many Americans to pay more for care , give up benefits  --  or both . " Any reform will create millions of winners and millions of losers . Health care is the most emotional and personal of all public policy issues , " says John Rother , director of legislation and public policy for the American Association of Retired Persons .
