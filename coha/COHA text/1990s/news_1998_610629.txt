<p> The ads look promising enough : " Work from Home ! ! " " Get Paid for Stuffing Envelopes . " " Up to $ 800 a week extra income . " <p> An unsuspecting mother , desperately seeking a way to help make ends meet , answers the ad . She learns that she , too , can start up her own home business , stay home with the kids and still bring home the bacon . . . for a " small fee . " <p> Once she makes the original query , she re a letter asking that she send even " supplies . " Or maybe she gets a book that explains how to get other people to send her money in exchange for the so-called secret of how to turn envelope-stuffing into high profits . <p> Or she just ends up getting scammed . <p> Increasingly , experts say , the latter is more apt to be the case as home-busi cons are hawked in newspapers , magazines , fliers and even on the Internet as legitimate money-making opportunities . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work from home , " says Lesley Spencer , founder of Home-Based Working Moms , an Austin-based support and advocacy group . " There will also be more people creating scams . " <p> Thousands of women leave the work force every year to stay home and raise their children , many of them looking for home-business opportunities to supplement their families ' income . But high hopes of higher income often can end in embarrassment and disappointment . <p> According to the Washington D.C. Better Business Bureau , con artists tend to prey on seniors , the disabled and " mothers who want to stay home with their kids and want to supplement their incomes , " although women are n't the only targets . <p> " The scoundrels out there are not sexist , " says Gene Fairbrother , a consultant for the Washington-based National Association for the Self-Employed ( NASE ) . " They do n't care what your gender is as long as your money is green . " <p> But the growing number of women looking for home-business opportunities makes them a prime target for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of letters from women who are almost in a panic , " says DeAnna Post , president of Mothers Access to Careers at Home ( MATCH ) , a local advocacy group . " They 're desperate , " she says . " Where there 's desperation , a lot of people feed off of that . " <p> Most families need two incomes to make ends meet , says Tina Egge , executive director of the Association of Enterprising Mothers , a support group of work-at-home mothers based in Carlsbad , Calif . <p> " Financially people set themselves in a position where two incomes are needed . Although you can cut back here and there , people really want to stay home with their kids , " says Egge . <p> That 's the predicament Gail Compton of Alexandria faced a few years ago . She wanted to be a stay-at-home mom , but she needed to make extra money . When she saw an ad in the newspaper promising hundreds of dollars for stuffing envelopes at home , it seemed like the answer to her prayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks were too good to be true . But the promise of earning hundreds sounded more reasonable . <p> She sent $ 35 and received a book of poorly copied pages with addresses of companies that needed envelope stuffers to handle " overflow " work . But all of the companies she contacted wanted more money , in some cases , hundreds of dollars to " register " in their program . <p> " Everybody wanted more money , " says Compton , 42 . " I had already wasted $ 35 . That 's a lot to lose for someone counting every dollar . <p> " It 's just wrong , " says Compton , a local coordinator for a national support group , Mothers of Pre-Schoolers ( MOPS ) . " I think it makes you very cynical and tend to doubt people . " <p> There are no statistics on exactly how many people are victims of home-business scams each year . Experts say the embarrassment of having fallen for a con keeps many victims from reporting the incident . Also , because the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 60 , many people simply do n't see it as being worth calling the authorities . <p> " One of the reasons the scammers are able to succeed is it 's a low-ticket item , " says Edward J. Johnson III , president of the Washington D.C. Better Business Bureau . " People figure they learned their lesson . But it 's a tough lesson to learn . " <p> Although there are no definitive figures on how many people are victimized by home business scams , experts say a rapidly growing number of complaints is proof of a growing problem . Work-at-home scams are one of the top inquiries and complaints that the Better Business Bureau receives nationwide . Of 300 industries monitored by the agency , home-based businesses ranked 33rd in the number of complaints received nationwide in 1995 , compared to a ranking of 67 just four years earlier . In 1995 , the agency received 215,000 inquiries about home-based business opportunities . <p> And now , home-business opportunities are showing up on the Internet with promises of " Use your computer to make big bucks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has involved targeting people with computer skills , Johnson says . <p> So how can anyone who just wants to make a little extra money on the side weed out the good from the bad ? <p> Most experts say follow the old adage , " If it sounds too good to be true , it probably is . " <p> " Have you ever met a person stuffing envelopes making money ? " asks Liz Folger , author of " The Stay-at-Home Moms Guide to Making Money . " The book has a whole section about home-business scams . <p> " So many moms fall for these scams because it sounds so easy and they like the idea they can work from home and be with their kids , " says Folger , 27 , who lives in Mount Shasta , Calif. , and works from home with her 4- and 2-year-old daughters . " Why I hate the scams so much is moms go for them , get taken to the cleaners and give up on the whole idea that they can actually work from home . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another prevalent scam deals with assembly or craft work . These programs often require people to pay hundreds of dollars for equipment or supplies or to spend hours producing goods for a company that has promised to buy them . In fraudulent schemes , after the person has purchased the supplies and performed the required tasks , the company refuses to pay for the work , often saying it is not " up to standard . " <p> Phone scams are one of the newer approaches . Companies list numbers to call in other countries for information about home businesses  --  the equivalent of a 900 call in the United States . Most consumers do not check the area code before dialing , assuming it is a U.S. phone number . When they get the phone bill , they discover they have called someplace like the Dominican Republic . <p> Folger suggests the best home business is one you start on your own . " There are some good business opportunities out there , " she says . " But the key is to go with something you really enjoy doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , have started companies that make clothing for premature babies . <p> Maria Macias , 27 , of Centreville is a distributor for a multilevel marketing company that sells herbal health and nutrition supplements . She contends that one of the real harms of scams is that they make people skeptical of the real business opportunities : " Have an open mind , " she says . " You really have to find out what it is that you want . Do n't be afraid to do anything . It 's sad because so many bad things are out there . Whatever you do check out the company . " <p> Fairbrother , who is a consultant for the 325,000 member National Association for the Self-Employed , says whatever you do , never send anybody money for information . <p> " If it 's a legitimate opportunity , they will be happy to send you information , " Fairbrother says . " If it 's a book , save your money and go to the library . You do n't have to pay somebody $ 50 for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already in the business . <p> " When I get calls from people who say they bought into a business opportunity and sent $ 500 or $ 5,000 , I ask them how many people did you talk to . They say ' I did n't talk to anybody . ' Big , big , big mistake . " <p> Another option for those who have not left the work force is to see if they can do their current job at home by telecommuting , says the BBB 's Johnson . <p> Whatever business a person chooses , finding information , support and networking opportunities with other home businesses is a key to success . <p> " It 's important to find a mentor or other moms working at home , " says Folger . " It 's so important to be able to talk to other moms . " <p> National home-based businesses and working mom groups , such as MATCH , provide members with information and support networks . Online chat rooms and Web sites for people who are interested or involved in home businesses also are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely running a business out of your home , " says Fairbrother . " Having those outside sources can help maintain your sanity . " <p> Do n't Get Taken In <p> If you are looking for a home-based business or job , here are some suggestions to help you avoid possible scams : <p> Always check out the company by calling the Better Business Bureau or consumer protection office located in that company 's town . <p> Ask for at least 10 references . Call each person and ask about his experiences with the company . Gene Fairbrother of the National Association for the Self-Employed warns not to be satisfied with a few names and to be careful : " If it is truly a scam you will probably be given names of people whose only job is to talk to people who are interested in it and tell them how good it is . " <p> Be cautious of any company that asks for money to make money ( such as money for registration , materials or instructions ) . <p> Do n't be fooled by ads claiming you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . And be cautious of companies that require you to sign up immediately . <p> Get specific information from the company such as how long it 's been in business , where it 's located ( not just a post office box ) , how many customers it has , what its refund policy is ( get this in writing and read it thoroughly ) , how long it takes to get paid . <p> If you invest in an opportunity that turns out to be a scam , report it to the Federal Trade Commission , your state 's Attorney General , your local consumer protection office and your local Better Business Bureau . <p> You also should contact your local postmaster . The U.S. Postal Service investigates fraudulent mail practices . <p> If you answered an ad in a publication , the advertising manager may be interested to learn about the problems you have had with the company .
