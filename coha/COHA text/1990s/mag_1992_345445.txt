In her native Africa , singer Aster Aweke is so popular that she has been dubbed " Ethiopia 's Donna Summer . " But Aweke , who grew up listening to Aretha Franklin and Billie Holiday , always dreamed of being a hit in America . Now , nine years after moving to the U.S. , she has achieved her goal . Her album Kabu ( Columbia Records ) reached No. 4 on Billboard 's World Music chart . Kabu gets its power from Aweke 's vocals , which soar above a lush weave of Ethiopian folk melodies and American jazz and pop , evoking sunny images of love and life in her rural homeland . Yet most fans who buy her records ca n't understand a word she sings . Says Aweke , who sings in Amharic : " Americans say , ' We do n't know what you 're talking about , but we can follow ; we feel you there . ' " <P> Aweke is not the only non-English singer who is coming through clearly . Salif Keita , an ebullient singer from Djoliba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Billboard World Music chart for 12 weeks , mixes Western guitars and drums with high-tech electronics that mimic such Mandingo instruments as the stringed kora and the xylophone-like balaphon . Brazilian singer Margareth Menezes , the French guitar troupe Gipsy Kings and Zimbabwe 's Thomas Mapfumo , among others , also have solid new albums on the U.S. market . <P> " People are becoming aware there are other musical styles besides Western rock and pop that are just as valid , " explains David Byrne , who helped pioneer the fusion of rock and Third World traditions with his band Talking Heads . Byrne 's interest in non-European music led him to found his own label , Luaka Bop , which has issued an ambitious series of compilations and samplers . <P> The appeal of world-music artists lies in their heartfelt intensity  --  something that has become rare in the cookie-cutter commercialism of Western rock and pop . " You get tired of turning on the radio , and it sounds like the same producer could have made half the Top 10 , " says Byrne , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anand this year . " You get assaulted by a million different cultures when you walk down the streets of most American cities , and that 's not reflected in the music . " <P> World music  --  the term was coined by ethnomusicologists as a catchall for non-European , indigenous traditions  --  has been seeping into the Western pop mainstream for years through progressive recordings by Byrne , the Beatles , Peter Gabriel and Paul Simon . Simon 's Graceland and The Rhythm of the Saints albums , particularly , brought South African and Brazilian folk styles to a mass audience . Now , after decades of borrowing by Western musicians , Third World composers are creating cross-cultural fusions of their own  --  and finding a growing audience . Ten years ago , a world-music album was lucky to sell a few thousand copies in the U.S. Today 10,000 to 50,000 copies is more typical , and the number of artists and record companies  --  from Luaka Bop to Mango , Real World and Rhythm Safari  --  has exploded .
