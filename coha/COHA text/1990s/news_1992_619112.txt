<p> Six months after his darkened bones were taken from the moldering remnants of a coffin of ship 's planks above a cold Aleutian beach  --  and 250 years after he died of gangrene and perhaps despair  --  the Danish-born explorer Vitus Bering has completed his voyage . <p> In Moscow , birthplace of Peter the Great , the ambitious czar who told Bering to explore the far northeastern fringe of the empire and beyond , Russian pathologists are reconstructing Bering 's face from a cast they made of his skull , putting flesh on a hero of both Russia and Denmark . <p> Soon they will know what he looked like , a fact not well recorded by portraitists of Bering 's time . His teeth are intact , putting to rest long-held assumptions that he had died of scurvy , a vitamin deficiency disease common on long 18th century sea voyages . Medical tests at the Institute of Forensics in Moscow suggest that he actually died of gangrene from injuries or other causes . <p> The project culminates a remarkable Russian-Danish archeological expedition to wind-swept Bering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its aim was to explore the last camp of the man with his name on the maps . He led one of the greatest explorations in history , blazing the way for later Russian expansion into the New World from Alaska to the Fort Ross fur- trading colony on California 's north shore . <p> The archeology project 's several dozen members spent July in rough conditions , chopping exploration trenches in the tundra and cobbled beach of Bering Island . And , in a Red empire falling apart in all ways except devotion to red tape , they lacked the right papers to satisfy suspicious local authorities that their excavations were legitimate . <p> " It was a disorganized expedition . We had to negotiate half the time we were there , " said Jesper Westley Jorgensen , a photographer who accompanied the expedition for a Danish magazine and whose images appear on these pages . " But after the Danish team found the burial , it was impossible to stop the project . " <p> The campsite was already known , but not Bering 's last resting place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we knew that the top of a sandy ridge would have been the best place for a burial ground , " said Ole Schiorring , director of the Horsens Museum in Denmark and an archeologist familiar with digging up medieval and iron-age settlements . " It was where anybody would bury their dead in the winter . In four hours , we found the first bone , " said Schiorring . <p> It was a toe bone . Before long , careful digging uncovered six men . Only one of the men had been buried in a coffin , now reduced to bits of wood clinging to iron nails around the bones , the skull staring up at the sky . The skeleton 's measurements matched what was known of Bering . <p> The 50-mile-long island at the southwestern corner of the Bering Sea is virtually treeless . Only Bering would have warranted use of such a precious resource for a coffin . " I was satisfied to have found him , " Schiorring said , " not because of the excitement of finding a famous man , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the crew about conditions there , at the end . " <p> Photographer Jorgensen said the trip was " fun , in its way  --  if it is fun to stay in a broken-down Polish tent in cold temperatures and rain , and sit around a Siberian fire , looking out at the Bering Sea . <p> " Sometimes we got salmon , " said Jorgensen , " which we caught in a little river that ran by the camp , but every day we had the same mysterious porridge for breakfast , and every day for lunch we had noodle pasta , and the same for dinner . " To top it off , the Russians would n't let the Danes use their radios . <p> The raw environment , with near-freezing temperatures at night even in July , hints at the desperation of Bering 's last days as winter closed in and of the toughness his explorations demanded . <p> Vitus Jonassen Bering was born in 1681 in Horsens , on Denmark 's Jutland Peninsula . As did many youths in the town , he went to sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for the Russian Navy , newly created by Czar Peter I as part of his drive to make his vast , backward land a great power . <p> Bering advanced rapidly to captain and performed heroically in the Great Nordic War that expelled Sweden from the Baltics . In 1724 , Peter , who by then had proclaimed himself emperor , rewarded Bering by naming him leader of the First Kamchatkan Expedition . Its mission : to learn if land connected Siberia to Alaska . After leaving Peter 's new capital , St. Petersburg , Bering and his 44-man crew built a ship on the mouth of the Kamchatka River and sailed enough of the far eastern coast to confirm that water  --  the Bering Strait  --  lay between the Old World and the New . But he did not spot North America . <p> Czar Peter I died in 1725 . Bering 's assertions that no land bridge exists prompted so much skepticism that he persuaded Peter 's successor , the empress Anne , to support another , grander attempt . Bering and 600 men left St. Petersburg in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most extensive explorations ever undertaken . <p> While contingents of Bering 's party reconnoitered Japan , a second group , including Bering , went north , aboard the ship St. Peter . Others , commanded by Alexei Chirikov , sailed in the St. Paul . They explored the the huge , cold Bering Sea north of the Aleutians , mapped much of the southwestern coast of Alaska and the Alaskan Peninsula , contacted the Eskimos , Aleuts and other peoples native to the region , and sought in vain a mythical land called Gamaland that was supposed to lie south of the Aleutians . <p> Bering , increasingly ill , was able to spend but one day himself in Alaska proper , while Chirikov 's group explored widely . Frustrated , with much of his crew suffering scurvy and worn out by the hardship of the voyage , Bering set his course home . Chirikov and the St. Paul made it back to Petropavlovsk , a city Bering had founded , but Bering and his exhausted crew ran aground on the island that now carries his name , 300 miles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were forced to spend the winter . Only 46 returned . The recorded date of Bering 's death is December 8 , 1741 , on the Julian calendar the Russians used . The modern calendar puts it at December 19 . <p> Despite the expedition 's dismal end , it opened the door to a century of Russian colonization and revealed a vast region for the first time to European knowledge . One of the great scientific works of the early 18th century was written by the expedition 's naturalist , Georg Wilhelm Steller . His detailed account of the animals and plants of the region included descriptions of two creatures that bear his name , the Steller sea lion and the now-extinct Steller sea cow . <p> Steller died on his return trip to St. Petersburg , but his report and those of others provided clues to the cruel winter on Bering Island . They described the huts the men lived in , and the foundry they built to cast metal parts for a boat to take them out in the spring . From the 19th century on , archeologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrey Stanyukovich , an archeologist and a member of the then-Soviet Academy of Sciences , discovered traces of the collapsed huts . <p> Last summer 's expedition , organized by the Moscow-based Adventurers Club , grew as it went along . <p> The previous year , some of the club 's members visited Horsens . " They wanted to just go to the place ( where Bering had died ) , and thought a small local museum would like to take part , " Schiorring said . As word of the trip spread , money for a full-fledged archeological dig began flowing in from city and county offices , local banks , a brewery , and the public to finance the search for Horsens ' famous long-lost son . <p> In the meantime , a group of Russian archeologists , including Stanyukovich , signed on . The Adventurers Club , however , failed to get permits from the appropriate ministries in Moscow  --  a difficult task in any case , with the central government falling apart . Helicopters that had been scheduled to take the explorers to the site did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet navy vessel . Once there , long arguments ensued with local officials unsure whether this group of Russians and Danes was entitled to dig up a national hero . <p> But work went on , and while the Danes successfully recovered the bones , the Russians mapped the encampment and found four buried cannons from the St. Peter . <p> In early August , the group , carrying Bering 's remains , was on its way back aboard another Soviet navy ship when the ship 's crew suddenly and mysteriously sailed full speed to Petropovlovsk . The archeologists later realized that their dash to port occurred on the eve of the doomed Soviet coup . As they carried to Moscow the remains of a man who helped launch one great Russian empire , they were enmeshed in the collapse of its successor . <p> On December 8 , to mark the 250th anniversary of Bering 's death , Russian team members visited Horsens with their cast of Bering 's skull , including the partially reconstructed face to which layers of artificial muscle , tendons and skin are being applied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March . <p> And next summer , if all goes as planned , the bones themselves will go back to Bering Island for reburial . " I think , not in the exact same spot , " Schiorring said . " The place we found him is rather flattened , by the sea and river , so it would be better to put him a little higher up . " A suitable monument , he said , will mark where the Great Northern Expedition ended .
