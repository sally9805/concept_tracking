Roberta Simon was eight years old when poliomyelitis paralyzed her from the neck down . She spent three months on her back in a Washington hospital and then began a long series of treatments and exercises that slowly , painfully restored full mobility to her limbs . Like many brave polio victims , she pushed herself hard . She was a majorette in junior high school , went to college and eventually became a surgical nurse in a Chicago-area hospital , working long hours on her feet in the operating room . " I was out there doing my thing , " she says . " I thought I was over polio . " <P> She was wrong . One day 36 years after the disease disrupted her childhood , she felt some familiar symptoms . They started as muscle fatigue , weakness and pain . Then her legs collapsed under her , and she had to lean against walls to stand up straight . She went to specialists and took test after test . " They all came back negative , " says Simon . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychotherapist . " Finally , four years later , Simon was correctly diagnosed . She had polio . Again . <P> Forty years after the great polio epidemic of the 1940s and ' 50s swept through the U.S. , infecting millions and leaving some 640,000 ( mostly children ) with varying degrees of paralysis , survivors are being revisited by a degenerative muscle condition that has precisely the same symptoms as a mild case of polio . The ailment is known as acute paralytic poliomyelitis sequelae , or postpolio syndrome . Doctors are n't certain what causes it or how best to treat it ( for many years physicians prescribed exercises that exacerbated the condition ) , but they believe the problem will get worse before it gets better . Before the end of the decade , by one estimate , postpolio syndrome will strike 40% to 50% of the polio survivors , forcing many in their 50s , 60s and 70s to relive the childhood pain and suffering they thought was behind them . <P> The symptoms of postpolio mimic those of the original disease , albeit in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle weakness , painful joints and , sometimes , difficult breathing . The discomfort usually begins in the muscles affected by the original infection but can spread . Patients who got polio before age 10 and suffered particularly severe cases seem to be the most susceptible to the aftereffects . <P> What triggers postpolio syndrome ? One possibility is that the polio virus becomes active again after decades of lying dormant in victims ' cells . This notion gained support in 1991 , when British scientists reported that 58% of the postpolio patients they tested had high concentrations of polio-type antibodies not only in their blood , which is to be expected , but also in their spinal fluid , which suggests a current infection . That does not explain , however , why the disease resurfaces so long after the original infection , and attempts to replicate the British findings have been unsuccessful . Since it 's possible that the dormant virus could mutate into active new forms , scientists are searching for such culprits .               @ @ @ @ @ @
