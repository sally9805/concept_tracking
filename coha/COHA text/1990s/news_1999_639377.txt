<p> It is obvious to everyone that Colorado generally and the Denver metropolitan area specifically confront serious transportation problems that are severely damaging our quality of life . The population has grown rapidly to 2.3 million persons and is expected to reach 3 million in less than 25 years . At the same time , the number of vehicle miles traveled has grown even more rapidly as old communities like Parker have expanded dramatically and new suburban and exurban developments emerge weekly . We are all suffering the consequences of long delays and frustrations in attempting to reach our great natural resource , the beauty of the mountains , longer commutes to work , shops , sporting events , increased air pollution and more road rage , accidents and casualties . <p> Numerous plans and proposals have been advanced to " fix " the problem . These range from building a monorail along Interstate 70 , using market forces by charging tolls , expanded light rail , more lanes along Interstate 25 , a train to DIA , and so forth . <p> But we have no consensus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate often based more on ideological predispositions than on any understanding of the fundamental principles that are accepted by practically all transportation experts . These can be summarized as follows : <p> 1 . Automobiles are here to stay . <p> They provide many advantages to their owners - comfort , flexibility , freedom and autonomy - and are an indispensable part of any transportation system . At the same time , they impose heavy external costs - economic , social and environmental - upon communities . Further , not everyone can own or drive a car ; for example , the issue of how to provide senior citizens with mobility is one that will only get worse as our population continues to age rapidly . <p> 2 . No metropolitan area can build itself out of congestion . <p> It is impossible to construct enough highway and parking capacity to satisfy the potential demand . Not only are the financial costs enormous but the loss of time due to construction delays aggravates drivers for years . In the case of south I-25 , for example , an investment of $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only about 6 minutes during rush hour , from Arapahoe Road to Downtown Denver , though non-rush hour traffic is expected to benefit greatly , if the projections are valid . Transit will save 17 minutes because it is especially effective when highways break down . A similar situation exists on I-70 , where the projected financial and other expansion costs resulted in a unanimous decision by I-70 stakeholders to seek other solutions . <p> 3 . Induced demand or generated traffic . <p> Even if the costs were acceptable , the principle of " induced demand " or " generated traffic " means that as road capacity increases so does usage because drivers will inexorably shift their travel patterns to take advantage of the new facilities . Instead of patronizing nearby restaurants and shops and using alternative routes , or even other modes , people will be tempted to travel further along the new lanes . Moreover , businesses and residents consider travel time when making location decisions , thus increasing sprawl and future congestion . The overall result , well-documented in various studies , is that only a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ externalities associated with enhanced car use increased . <p> 4 . Transportation is not an end in itself - unless you 're a teenager . <p> For most of us , transportation is a way of reaching a destination - a job , school , hospital , favored fishing hole . Hence , the closer that people live to their jobs , the less commuting is required . But , although the suburban counties have grown rapidly , and new jobs have been created , average commuting distances continue to increase . Attracting shopping malls helps the tax base but creates new stresses upon the transportation system as the new Park Meadows mall demonstrates . Hence a sound transportation policy must be supported by policies that emphasize primary job creation and zoning and land-use standards that balance development and transportation . <p> 5 . Planning must be integrated and systemic . <p> The landmark Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act ( 1991 ) and its successor , the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century ( TEA-21 ) , recognized this fundamental point by giving metropolitan planning organizations , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other transportation modes besides highways . At the same time , new concepts such as " smart growth , " " new urbanism , " " sustainable development " and " intermodalism " have been developed and have gained widespread acceptance . <p> 6 . Transportation planning must be ethically based . <p> Planners are increasingly interested in utilizing the above concepts to create a system that would minimize dependency upon imported fossil fuels and be environmentally benign in terms of pollution and land use , equitable in terms of its costs and benefits , efficient , safe and secure . Such a system would contribute greatly to the achievement of " smart growth " or " sustainable development , " the kind that permits our children and grandchildren to enjoy a quality of life that is at least no worse than our own . <p> Intermodalism is the backbone of any such strategy . Although common word-processing programs do not recognize the word , this concept has proven itself in the freight field . Essentially it calls for a systemic approach to the movement of goods and people based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has advantages and disadvantages , the trick is to use modes according to their strengths and to work to minimize their costs through technological innovations . <p> That is what has happened in goods movement where a new industry moves containers around the world through an interconnected system of sea , rail , air and highway modes . <p> Today 's global economy would be unthinkable without this transportation revolution . Unfortunately , although the United States is the acknowledged leader in intermodal freight transportation , it lags well behind Europe in intermodal passenger transportation . <p> One local example should suffice . DIA is inaccessible except by bus and car . Such European airports as Heathrow and Frankfurt , on the other hand , provide the traveler with an array of choices - subways and intercity trains as well as taxis and buses . <p> What is required , therefore , is a new approach to solving our transportation problems , one that recognizes the importance of the automobile and highways but that has as its goal an integrated system that permits people to shift easily from one mode to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation projects have historically been implemented in this region or are being debated today . We continue to be faced with a barrage of projects , each of which is being sold on its own merits with little attention to how they will be linked . One of the most pressing issues is obviously how to connect a light-rail system to an I-70 monorail , to a DIA train and to the highway and road system . Such connectivity involves thinking about how a passenger who rides public transit can reach a final destination . <p> There are many reasons why such planning has not taken place , even though CDOT , in 1996 , developed the first statewide plan and DRCOG has produced Metrovision 2020 . At the root is the fact that it is necessary to get several different transportation organizations to agree , each with its own culture , agenda and clients , and to do so when political power is favorably disposed . This has proven to be no easy task . <p> Until recently the RTD board was in disarray , and CDOT and DRCOG were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature , though supportive , did not provide adequate financial resources . <p> Now , however , there is a ray of hope , as there seems to be movement at the state level toward a more inclusive approach , and local governments have joined with the private sector and environmental groups in the " Transit Alliance " to promote and implement rapid transit . <p> Furthermore , a project such as Union Station 's transformation into a hub for buses , HOV lanes , Amtrak , the light rail spur in the Platte Valley and , hopefully , Greyhound bus lines , represents a fine example of intermodalism in action . <p> These developments , though very significant , are only the beginning . An overall plan that enjoys widespread public support is required . Such a plan should incorporate highway improvements ( including perhaps some highway expansion ) , the use of market mechanisms such as tolls , traffic demand management programs , an expanded rapid transit system that reaches to DIA and the mountains , and possible rail connections to Boulder , Fort Collins and Pueblo . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Intermodal Transportation Institute is committed . Our goal , working with an advisory council of local experts and other stakeholders is to help develop an intermodal system for passengers and freight that promotes the quality of life in our community . The challenge is clear . Where do we go from here ?
