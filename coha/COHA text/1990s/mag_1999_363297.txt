I 'm turning into a truly shallow and pathetic person . The proof ? Ask me to name the most important moment in my life this past year , and I answer without hesitation : getting high-speed access to the Internet at home . It happened two weeks ago , and I 'm still faint with excitement . I feel like getting bumper stickers printed up : ASK ME ABOUT MY CABLE MODEM ! For months , years even , I 've been stalking my local phone and cable monopolies , only to be told that broadband access to the Net was n't yet available on my block . The phone company 's offering , known as DSL , is n't even on the horizon where I live on Long Island , N.Y . It was my cable monopoly , Cablevision , that finally won the race to my house . <P> I had heard horror stories about how long it would take to install the cable modem . These turned out to be untrue . Since I already had a TV-cable outlet in my home office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the modem , drop an Ethernet card into my PC and configure it all . Bing , bang , I 'm online at 5 or more megabits per sec . <P> And suddenly life will never be the same . It was like the first time I received an e-mail . Trust me on this : once you get high-speed access to the Net and it 's at your disposal all the time , you 'll understand what all the hoopla is about . It 's faster than my connection at work . My two phone lines , which were always tied up with modem traffic , are now always free . My daughters can connect to AOL without ever hearing a busy signal . And my wife can buy things on eBay fast , without having to wait through endless page reloads . So not all of it is good news . Still ... <P> Within a day of getting online , however , I realized I needed two things : a home network so the two computers in my office could share the cable modem , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was especially urgent , I felt . It spooked me to leave my PCs connected to the Net all day unattended . The simple security solutions  --  unplugging them or disabling file sharing  --  did n't work because I needed to share files with my wife . And I can never remember to unplug the modem at night . I ended up getting BlackICE Defender , a $39 piece of software that I downloaded ( in about a minute ) , from
