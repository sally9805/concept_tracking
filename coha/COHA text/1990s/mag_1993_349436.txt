Beneath the heat of TV klieg lights and the crush of security guards at a Tokyo hotel , the structure of Japanese politics began to crumble last week . Tsutomu Hata , three times a Cabinet minister for the Liberal Democratic Party that had ruled the country for 37 uninterrupted years , announced that he and 43 Diet colleagues had quit the L.D.P. , forming a new party that would contest parliamentary elections to be held later this month . " Our party has been born to expedite a new wind , a new voice , a new system , " said the smooth-talking Hata . " We pledge we will use all our strength to resuscitate politics and open a new page in history . " <P> Hata 's new party , roughly translated as Japan Renewal , the second group in three days to defect from the Liberal Democrats , is considered the most likely to pull together a coalition able to oust what is left of Japan 's unruly and unroyal dynasty . Once the managers of Japan 's rise to economic-superpower status under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberal Democrats today are noted for a single , sordid attribute : corruption . Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa sank to a lowly 9% approval rating two weeks ago after he buckled under party pressure and failed to deliver promised anticorruption legislation , despite intense popular demands to do so . That provoked a successful no-confidence motion in the Diet  --  supported by Hata 's group and 11 other L.D.P. legislators  --  and hence the call for national elections . <P> Stunned by the legislative coup , Japan is now thoroughly absorbed by its newly chaotic politics . U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor arrived in Tokyo Tuesday looking for someone in the mood to negotiate in preparation for the Group of Seven summit meeting next week . It is unlikely that Miyazawa 's lame-duck government will offer any major new trade concessions or initiatives to help boost the world economy , increasing chances that the Tokyo summit will be stillborn . <P> The fervent hope among most Japanese is that the emerging new order will destroy the powerful interest groups that have dominated the political and business arenas , eventually producing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how fresh are the new winds swirling around the Diet ? Are Hata and company born-again politicians destined to shape the post-cold war era ? Or are they rats fleeing a sinking ship ? Hata and all his colleagues were members of the Takeshita faction of the L.D.P. , which was close to the center of all the corruption scandals in recent years . <P> What is more , the political engineer behind Hata 's insurgency is Ichiro Ozawa , a tough backroom operator who was right-hand man to Shin Kanemaru , the Takeshita faction 's Mr. Big until prosecutors caught up with him last March . Kanemaru stands trial next month on charges of failing to pay taxes on the millions he allegedly skimmed off illicit political donations . Largely because of Ozawa 's close association with Kanemaru , the national daily Asahi Shimbun is less than impressed with the new group . " They attack the limitations of the L.D.P. , " the paper noted last week . " But were n't they at the core of such a party until only yesterday ? Were n't they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kanemaru ?
