SOMEBODY 'S GOT TA HOLD ME UP , CAUSE I CAI N'T LEAN WELL ON A NOTHING POST .. MY SOUL NEEDS THE HUM OF A SISTA SINGIN NO WAYS TIRED AS I DRAG MY WEARY FEET , PROMISE ME , JANIE MAE , YOU 'LL LEARN HOW TO ROCK-A-MY-SOUL , AND WHEN ITS YOUR TURN , I 'LL BE THE POST . FROM THE POEM " ROCK-A-MY-SOUL BY VALERIE BRIDGEMAN DAVIS // " I 'LL HELP YOU , " the Reverend Dr. Michele DeLeaver Balamani said gently her ebony brow wrinkling with worry . Help me ? Balamani did n't know it then , but her offer of help only increased my agony , diminishing my ego by the minute . That morning I had awakened a winner . For three years I had worked on a doctoral project on how to lay a spiritual foundation to help addicted women stop drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , devised a solution , researched and measured it and documented results . All I had to do now was show up at the United Theological Seminary in Dayton and present the findings orally . A mere formality , I had thought . I waited as the other sisters who were in the doctoral program with me moved quickly through the process . They went in smiling and came out laughing . But when it was my turn , I could feel a sharp downturn in the mood . I was too defensive . Every criticism felt like pins in my flesh , every suggestion like a challenge to a duel at high noon . When an adviser told me some of my assumptions needed rewriting , I felt as if I were coming unglued . Did n't they realize that this was not about footnotes and theoretical assumptions , that it was about fighting the devil and saving souls ? Did n't they understand ? " That 's it . I quit , " I told my colleagues after leaving the meeting . I had simply run out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't read another book , write another word , get on another airplane , lift another finger , take any more criticism . The truth was , I had n't fully recovered from the wounds of the year before . My spiritual center and head of my household , " Granny " Jackson , had died , my son had been acting out in school , and on top of that , my strong opinions had gotten me fired from the editorial board of the nation 's most widely read newspaper , USA Today . I had lost my newspaper column and my main source of income , yet through it all I 'd met every deadline on this project . And what did I get at the end ? No appreciation , just more rejection . Who needs this ? I thought . I am outta here . Then she walked up , a tall , Maya Angelou-looking woman , with such towering braids that I often jokingly called her Your Braidship . Michele Balamani said , " I 'll help you . I mean it . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer as ridicule . If I needed help with statistics or computer software , that would be one thing , but she was offering me help in the one area in which I considered myself an expert : commentary and writing . The more I considered her proposal , the more broken I felt . For decades I had never needed help ; I had always been competitive . I had pulled others , but I had no idea how it felt to allow oneself to be pushed , to lean on someone while you catch your breath . What would it feel like to let another sister drag me over a breach while I stopped a moment to rest my weary feet ? I did eventually accept Balamani 's offer ; I allowed her to help me refocus my project , which she did in a manner that was nothing short of miraculous . We are great friends now , partners in many struggles . But accepting help back then was a hurting thing . To admit your own need for assistance means being humble , something I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent , and accepting Balamani 's help that day meant surrendering self-pride to achieve a larger goal . And in this case it meant recognizing talent in another sister that just might be greater than my own . Such humility is difficult for many of us , familiar as we are with the model of the Black superwoman-the mother daughter , worker , friend who carries all the burdens , never asking for help in return . We believe we must have all the answers , and when we do n't we silently berate ourselves . No wonder we get tired ! No wonder so many of us arrive at a place in our lives where we feel hopeless , stymied by depression , pessimism or the lethargy of simply not knowing how to go on . At such times procrastination and avoidance seem easier than facing our challenges head-on . // We are no good to anyone when we feel like this-not our families , our communities , least of all ourselves . To offer compassion and service to others , we must first give these things to ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions and attitudes that will make available the energy and imagination we need to be effective in our lives . Sometimes that means being willing to accept aid ourselves . Before the day Balamani walked up and offered her help , my inner goal , my sustaining dream was to help drug- and alcohol-addicted women . My own struggle with alcohol addiction had prepared me for this particular ministry , and I felt literally called to it . And yet I experienced a moment of soul weariness so great I had been willing to abandon my calling . But God would not let me do it . Instead , the Lord prompted Balamani to reach for my hand . This experience crystallized for me the lessons we must all keep in mind if we are to continue moving forward in our lives : * Let the Holy Spirit guide you . Or as I like to say , get behind the cross and let God take care of the details . The seminary program I was part of , which stretched me in such painful but marvelous ways , was instrumental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by two determined AfricanAmerican female pastors and educators : the Reverend Dr. Claudette Anderson Copeland , cofounder and pastor of New Creation Christian Fellowship in San Antonio , and the Reverend Dr. Marsha Foster Boyd , academic dean at Payne Theological Seminary in Wilberforce , Ohio , and assistant pastor at Whitman Chapel AME church in Belpre , Ohio . Their idea was to train African-American clergy in an academic setting to reconstruct human lives from the inside out . The goal was to turn their students into spiritual leaders whose ministry would initiate social change . The effort was launched in 1995 . Twelve female clergy answered the call to become CopelandBoyd scholars at the United Theological Seminary , a predominantly White institution in Dayton . Two psychotherapists , an attorney , a chaplain , two well-established pastors and myself , the lone journalist , were among the sisters who responded . Six of us would actually complete the rigorous program : We made history last May as the 11 &year-old; institution 's first-ever Doctor of Ministry class made up entirely of African-American female scholars . Photograph Sisters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McAroy-Gray , Boyd , Reynolds and Copeland. // By allowing the Holy Spirit to guide them , pastors Copeland and Boyd pulled off the effort against great personal odds . Boyd , who was then one of the few Black professors at United , was subjected to criticism from her peers , who questioned her reasons for convening a group comprised only of Black women . Copeland had to battle cancer as well as the possibility of a divorce . Though none of us knew it till later , their personal struggles mirrored what many of us faced as we attempted to emulate the courage of our professors . Before we graduated , we would come to understand that we were not being trained by human hands , but by God . * Trust that you are where you need to be . Have you ever looked around and asked yourself , What am I doing here ? That was the way I felt when I showed up in the Copeland-Boyd program . I actually had come to the seminary to find a homiletics program , to improve my preaching skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled into the class with the Copeland-Boyd scholars . It was a jolt . Most of the other women were experienced preachers or pastors and had proven leadership skills . I had never even taught Sunday school . I was neither a leader nor a people mover , and I was so terribly disorganized I felt I could easily foul up a one-car parade . But I thought about the babies who might not be born in crackhouses or thrown in trash cans if more people like me would help women get off drugs . I prayed for the skills , the heart , the people and the provisions to do my work . That was the right prayer , and the more I depend on God to lead my steps , the more confident I am of success . * 1ain and suffering are tools you can use . When I began the program , I was more than willing to lounge on my couch reading about how to help hurting women . What I had n't bargained for in those three short years of the program was that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several of the other scholars felt the same way . We were wounded healers faced with saving our own lives even as we attempted to help others . Looked at in one way , our trials by fire were tragedies , but looked at another way they were preparation . At the end of our course we had each learned valuable lessons about empowering other sisters . But the first lesson we learned was that healing had to begin with ourselves . * 1o n't be afraid to start small . No matter how dejected or helpless you feel , the most important thing is to do something . Boyd and Copeland knew that they could make national ripples because of the time they had spent throwing pebbles in a small pond . Twenty years ago they met and became seminary buddies . They each spent the next two decades doing workshops on healing the pain of Black women . " What made us know we could do something large one day was our experience in doing something small , " says Boyd . " We had worked well individually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something larger . " * Focus on what will happen if you do n't act . When Copeland received the diagnosis every woman fears , she refused to fold . Instead , her pain and fear pushed her forward . Today she credits her breast-cancer diagnosis with forcing her to move her vision of a spiritual leadership program off the back burner . One of the nation 's top preachers and seminar leaders , she felt her inner clock running down and knew she had to move fast . " I had too much good stuff in me that would be buried with me if I did n't deposit it in someone else 's life , " she says . " The cancer made me focus squarely upon the volume of ministry in my gut that had never been expressed . I had to give birth to something that would help Black women while I still had time . Despite the trauma of it , cancer was the greatest blessing of my life . " Like Copeland , my classmate Dr. Shirlimarie McAroy-Gray had accomplished much in her field . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a senior staff attorney with the public defender 's office in the District of Columbia . But with all the savvy street smarts and organizing talent she had acquired , something showed up in her life she could n't control . She , too , received a frightening diagnosis-an adrenal tumor . Recalls McAroy-Gray : " I was sick beyond measure , hurt and scared for my then-3year-old daughter . I had no real family and did n't know who would take care of her if something happened to me . " So what kept her going ? " I felt if I stopped , I 'd die . " Today McAroy-Gray has created a Maryland-based ministry that intercedes in the lives of battered women , helping them regain self-esteem and self-control . The program grew out of her work defending battered women who had murdered a boyfriend or husband . ( Both Copeland and McAroy-Gray have since recovered from their health challenges. ) * Find power in telling our stories . For my part , I would have preferred for everyone to know me as a journalist and minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who had once been a closeted , active weekend alcoholic . Even in the seminary , ordained and preaching , I almost slipped backward when I was fired from the newspaper . The pain of losing my column was so intense . Fortunately , my sisters in the seminary gathered around me and prayed with me until my strength returned . Today I talk about my alcohol addiction and recovery because it helps people to understand the power of prayer and to see that the same God who delivered me will deliver anyone else who calls for help . Since coming out of the closet about my own struggles with alcohol , I have founded a progam called Harriet 's Children , a citywide ministry I established at Greater Mount Calvary Holy Church . I see the good it does when I visit a certain street corner in gritty Washington , D.C. , where a teenager is missing in action . On most nights she was there selling her body for ten bucks for crack . Now , as a result of Harriet 's Children , she is in treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye and say " You can stop . You can gain control of your life . Jesus can set you free , " my message is believable because I 've been there . In the same vein , Dr. Valerie Andrews , a fellow Copeland-Boyd scholar and a chaplain at Medgar Evers College in New York City , uses storytelling to help women break free of the shame and guilt associated with sexual abuse . " I was assaulted by my father first and by my two uncles and a close friend of the family , " says Andrews , who founded a pastoral counseling program called Tamar Speaks . " As long as all that pain was suppressed , I suffered the emotional pain of abandonment , rejection and low self-esteem . But when women speak out , these dirty little secrets have no power . " * Maintain balance . Highly productive women are often scattered , running all over the map . These women are so knee-deep in rescuing others , they do n't realize they are draining themselves dry . There is simply too much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one understands their dilemma better than Dr. Cynthia Rembert James , a fellow Copeland-Boyd scholar who is the founder of a program that shows caregivers how to take care of themselves . A psychologist , she holds a Ph.D . from Rutgers University and recently became the first African-American and the first female to be elected executive director of the northern California , northern Nevada and Hawaii region of the Church of God . In this capacity she serves as pastoral consultant to about 130 pastors and 50 congregations , two of which she pastors in Oakland . " Caregivers must improve their own self-care , " she asserts . " Sometimes highly motivated women can become overproductive , overfunctioning , overcommitted to the point that their work can become addictive . " She has set herself the task of helping overachieving women say a guiltless no and mean it , thus adding years to their lives . It is a lesson James first had to apply to herself * 1ut away your mask . In most churches people wear protective masks over their Sunday finery . So many are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pew or even the pulpits without a clue as to how to get the spiritual help they need . Good pastors can break through this phoniness , if they are not wearing masks themselves . Through the Copeland-Boyd program , Dr. Barbara Glenn found the courage to shed her " together " veneer and confront her own hidden hurt about past rejections and persistent feelings of isolation in the midst of a crowd . After taking off her own mask , Glenn , whose AME church in Alexandria is the largest in northern Virginia led by a woman , was able to devise a model called Kinfolk , One Anothering . The program helps to rekindle the relationships our enslaved mothers relied on , when family was more than bloodline , when extended networks cared for children and when women learned as much about God through their relationships with one another as they did by reading the Bible . As Glenn discovered , such healing connections among people are only possible when our masks no longer matter . * Finally , find the good and shout about it . A licensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pastoral Counseling Center in Largo , Maryland . While at the seminary , she developed a birth-to-grave concept of self-exploration called SHOUT ( Sisters Helping Others Understand Themselves ) . Her ministry has helped women to examine the wounds they have sustained and to recognize the strengths they have developed from living life as a Black female . She seeks to teach women how to " dance on their graves " by overcoming the challenges that threaten to bury them . Her ultimate goal is to establish a pastoral retreat center where overworked and overburdened clergy can become spiritually rejuvenated . An expert on depression , Balamani is acutely aware of the need for healers to find healing for themselves . She faced the blues herself when , during the program , Charles , her husband of 22 years , lost his job and returned to his homeland in the Congo for the sake of his mental health . " I wanted to use my tuck and travel ' coping techniques , " recalls this woman who , at a low point in my life , offered me her hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . But in the midst of my pain , God helped me create a model in which small groups of women could be guided through life 's issues to a point of liberation . And that is worth shouting about . " Indeed . Each Saturday Balamani and I do a radio show called Healing Moments , where we deal with such issues as forgiveness , fragmentation and depression from a therapeutic and spiritual perspective . Not only are we cohosting but we 're also cowriting , something I never thought I would do with anyone . Balamani and I are also creating a state-of-the-art healing center for women in the Maryland suburbs . I now understand that we all had to let go of our preconceived notions and allow the Holy Spirit to heal our fears . Before we could be " sisters " to others , we first had to learn how to become our own , and each other 's , Janie Mae . Nowadays , when my feet get tired and my soul needs tending , I can say without choking , " I cai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know dis true .
