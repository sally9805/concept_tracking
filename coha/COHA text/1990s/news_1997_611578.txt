<p> This is NATO country , with a zeal the Marlboro Man can only envy . <p> Left out of the Western alliance 's first wave of expansion last month in Madrid , Romania is swallowing its disappointment and making an all-out effort  --  political , economic and military  --  to guarantee it is on the second list of expansion countries scheduled to be named in April 1999 . <p> " Being in NATO is our main target , " said Col. Mihail Ionescu , chief of the Defense Ministry 's Directorate for European and North Atlantic Integration . " It was before Madrid , and it is even more so now . " <p> The determination to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization rises almost to the level of national obsession , with 95 percent of the population voicing approval despite the high price tag . More than desire for NATO 's nuclear umbrella , officials here say , the eagerness reflects an ache to see Romania anchored once more in the West after a generation of communism and the erratic dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign for NATO membership here is part of a widespread desire across Eastern Europe to join the winning side of the ideological struggle that concluded at the beginning of the decade . In that light , membership in NATO is seen here as a path toward sharing in the free-market riches of the evolving European Union . <p> " For us , it is an identity issue  --  being in the club , " explained Sorin Ducaru , who heads the Foreign Ministry 's NATO department . <p> The U.S. decision to limit the first cut of NATO expansion to Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic , formalized at the Madrid summit conference , has not generated the resentment predicted by some last spring , when President Emil Constantinescu 's government waged a quixotic campaign for admission with backing from France but little chance of success . <p> Instead , Romania is redoubling efforts to cement close strategic ties with the United States , recognizing Washington 's determinant role in NATO as well as its interest in East European and Balkan stability . At the same time , officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungary and the Czech Republic , with an eye to imitating what works well there and avoiding what fails . <p> " The idea is to have the same steps and approach to NATO as the three countries that are already integrating , " said Constantine Ionescu , the Defense Ministry 's secretary of state for defense policy and international relations . <p> In some ways , Romania failed to make the first cut at Madrid because it started from so far behind . Under Ceausescu 's suffocating hand , the country failed to begin the transformations already underway by the late 1980s in East European neighbors that were feeling the ripple from Mikhail Gorbachev 's Soviet perestroika , or economic restructuring . <p> The government that arose from Romania 's 1989 revolution under President Ion Iliescu swiftly began to reform the military and point toward NATO : It was the first to sign up for NATO 's Partnership for Peace program in 1994 . But it was slow to take difficult economic measures needed to undo the socialist economy . <p> With Slovenia  --  the other candidate wait-listed at Madrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private sector among major NATO contenders when the picks were made . This was identified as the big reason for leaving Romania out of the club . <p> Iliescu , branded a neo-communist , lost elections last November to an opposition coalition headed by Constantinescu . It was the first time since before World War II that Romania transferred power in unchallenged elections . Constantinescu and his prime minister , Victor Ciorbea , pledged to dive head-first into a free-market economy . But by that time , the image of a Romania slow to change was set , and there was too little time to undo it before Madrid . <p> " We did n't start too late , but we became visible too late , " Ducaru contended . <p> This month Ciorbea announced a list of 17 large , state-owned businesses that are being shut down , throwing 30,000 Romanians out of work at the beginning of what he has promised will be Polish-style economic shock therapy . <p> Diplomats here cautioned that this is only the beginning . Although half of Romania 's overall economic activity has moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the busy avenues of Bucharest , 80 percent of large-scale industrial production still comes from state-owned enterprises . <p> But Ciorbea , although a former union activist , has made it clear he wants all-out privatization despite the prospect of temporary social pain . <p> In the meantime , the Defense Ministry came home from Madrid , licked its wounds and started a military-wide assessment of what needs to be done by 1999 to make sure Romania gains admission to NATO . That review , which Col. Ionescu described as " bottom up , just like in the Pentagon , " is due in about 10 days . <p> Most necessary steps  --  force reduction , rank reorganization along NATO lines , modernizing equipment and procedures to make them NATO-compatible  --  already have begun . The question now , officials said , is how fast they can go , given budgetary restraints . <p> Defense Minister Victor Babiuc was recently notified , for example , that he will have to sustain an unexpected cut of about 10 percent in this year 's planned $ 1 billion allocation . Ironically , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the armed forces from just over 200,000 to 165,000 by 2000 . <p> Nonetheless , Ciorbea conducted tough negotiations last week with Bell Helicopter Textron for a $ 1 billion , 12-year program to produce in Romania 96 helicopter gunships modeled after the U.S. military 's AH-1W Super Cobra . Inevitably , the Romanian helicopter will be called the Dracula . <p> France expressed disappointment that Romania is choosing Bell over a French offer , particularly given Romania 's production of French helicopter models in the past and strong French support for Romania 's NATO candidacy before the Madrid decision . But Romanian officials said the choice was part of what they describe as a strategic partnership with Washington . <p> " We can say a lot of things about equality and so on , but we are convinced that the transatlantic link is the most important thing for security in the area , " explained Col. Ionescu . " We are right next to Russia . Political orientation is a question of interests . " <p> Similarly , a group led by Israel has begun upgrading some of Romania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 4 million a plane , advanced electronic equipment will make the aging craft compatible with NATO fleets . Several have been completed , but Ionescu expressed hope Romania 's economic changes will make it possible to buy U.S. F-16 or F/A-18 warplanes long before the MiG update is completed . <p> The Romanian military also has purchased a half-dozen FPS-117 deep-penetration radar units and four C-130 Hercules transports , with plans for eight more over the next two years . Now it is seeking to contract with Lockheed Martin for an East European regional C-130 maintenance center . <p> A facility here would fit into a strong desire to be seen bringing something to the table in NATO discussions leading up to expansion No. 2 in 1999 . For example , Romanian troops or military medical teams have participated in international peacekeeping in Bosnia , Albania , Rwanda , Angola , Somalia and the Persian Gulf over the last few years . Officials here are quick to express readiness for more , particularly in the volatile Balkans . <p> Ducaru said the government has contracted with the Center for Strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts and written source material that can make such contributions known in Congress and the administration in time for the 1999 decision . In addition , he said , Romania is seeking to attract more visits from U.S. congressional delegations during the next year and a half to build support for what promises to be a difficult debate on NATO expansion . <p> " Probably this is the most important thing , " said former defense minister Gheorghe Tinca , expressing hope that the government can make its case in Washington . " In the West , this is an important political issue . But for us , it is a historic opportunity . "
