<p> Just hours after a massive truck bomb turned the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City into a heap of bloody rubble , killing 168 people and injuring hundreds more , President Clinton promised to bring the full weight of the federal government down on the unknown terrorist bombers . <p> Now , nearly two years later , the Justice Department will finally put that resolve to the test here beginning Monday in the trial of Timothy James McVeigh , the decorated former Army sergeant who prosecutors contend consummated his seething hatred of the federal government with the worst act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history . <p> The government will likely finish its case sometime this summer by playing for the jury the only known audio tape of the April 19 , 1995 blast  --  a chilling recording of the 4,800-pound ammonium nitrate and fuel bomb exploding in front of the nine-story building , followed by distant sirens . <p> McVeigh and his alleged co-conspirator and Army buddy Terry Lynn Nichols , who is to be tried next , face the death penalty if convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pleaded not guilty . <p> After more than 26,000 witness interviews , the accumulation of 160,000 pages of material and at least 3,200 separate court filings , prosecutors will attempt to simplify the case for jurors by presenting a handful of basic facts and allegations buttressed by abundant circumstantial evidence . <p> The government will assert that the 20-foot Ryder truck that carried the bomb to Oklahoma City was rented from Elliott 's Body Shop in Junction City , Kan. , by one Robert Kling ; that Robert Kling was an alias used by Timothy McVeigh ; that McVeigh was videotaped at 3:57 p.m. on April 17 , 1995 , leaving a Junction City McDonald 's about a mile from Elliott 's ; that Kling rented the truck at 4:19 p.m. ; and that two days later , McVeigh was stopped for driving without a license plate about 60 miles north of Oklahoma City , 90 minutes after the blast . <p> " Nobody is that unlucky and nothing is that coincidental , " said one federal official . <p> Prosecutors plan to present eyewitnesses linking McVeigh to the truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammonium nitrate found at Nichols 's home and bearing McVeigh 's fingerprint ; and extensive telephone records the government contends are a virtual road map to the conspiracy . A crucial witness will be McVeigh 's close friend , Michael Fortier , who will fill in the details of how and why McVeigh allegedly planned the bombing . <p> One wild card as both sides prepare for jury selection next week is the impact of published reports alleging that McVeigh admitted to his defense team that he participated in the bombing . <p> Until these reports , McVeigh was heading into the trial in about as strong a strategic position as he could expect , given the evidence . While the government 's case is strong , it is largely circumstantial , with no credible eyewitness who can put McVeigh at the scene on April 19 . Stephen Jones , McVeigh 's ubiquitous , media-savvy attorney , has done his best to divert attention from his client , suggesting that everyone from Middle East terrorists to neo-Nazis could have been involved . <p> The essence of his defense will be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has repeatedly said that when investigators discovered McVeigh sitting in the Noble County , Okla. , jail on a gun charge stemming from the traffic stop , they abandoned any pursuit of other suspects . Jones has maintained that only experienced terrorists could have built such a powerful bomb , consisting of 55-gallon barrels stuffed with fuel-soaked fertilizer . The lawyer 's goal , legal experts say , is to confuse a jury and sow the seeds of reasonable doubt . <p> " We will concede no fact to them , " Jones said in a recent interview . " It does appear that the truck that was rented at Elliott 's carried the bomb  --  but everything else is up for grabs . " <p> With a battery of 14 court-appointed attorneys , the defense has won several tactical skirmishes in the past 18 months , succeeding in having Oklahoma judges recused from the case , getting the trial moved out of Oklahoma and severing the trial of Nichols . <p> In February , McVeigh may have gotten his biggest break when an internal Justice Department investigation of shoddy practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bombing case could have been tainted . <p> Further complicating the case are important questions that even the government concedes will not be fully answered at trial . The most important : Did McVeigh and Nichols have one or more accomplices ? The lingering question of whether there was a " John Doe No. 2 " who accompanied McVeigh as he allegedly rented the Ryder truck gives McVeigh 's attorneys an opening they will exploit to air a range of conspiracy theories . <p> The key elements that are likely to form the heart of the trial are as follows : <p> Motive <p> Prosecutors intend to use the defendant 's own words to support their contention that McVeigh 's intense hatred for the government drove him to blow up a building brimming with federal law enforcement officials and federal agencies at the start of a spring workday . Sources familiar with the government 's case say that McVeigh was indiscreet in sharing his anti-government views and left a paper trail . <p> Some of the most damaging evidence includes writing found on a computer disk in the possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say contains language threatening to law enforcement officials . The government will also introduce letters McVeigh wrote to a friend , espousing anti-government views , as well as more than 20 letters to his sister  --  including one suggesting something big was about to occur and that she would n't be able to reach him afterward . <p> But perhaps the most powerful piece of evidence suggesting motive was found in McVeigh 's car when he was arrested April 19 : an excerpt from " The Turner Diaries . " A bible of white militia groups , the 1978 novel describes an eerily similar attack on the FBI building in Washington , in which a truck bomb containing 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate and fuel is detonated in the underground garage at the beginning of a workday . <p> A source close to the defense acknowledges that McVeigh 's well-documented far-right views could hurt their effort . But prosecutors in turn fret that westerners ' traditional suspicions of the federal government could affect a sympathetic jury pool , according to sources close to the government . <p> Witnesses <p> Fortier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecution 's star witness . In exchange for his testimony , the former hardware store clerk was allowed to plead guilty to four lesser counts  --  including knowing about the conspiracy but failing to inform authorities . Attorneys in the case say Fortier will tell the court that he and McVeigh checked out the Murrah building in December 1994 and that McVeigh demonstrated how he would stack the barrels full of explosives using soup cans in Fortier 's living room . <p> Fortier 's wife , Lori , will corroborate his story , the attorneys say . She will testify that she helped McVeigh laminate a bogus driver 's license in the name of Robert Kling , which McVeigh then allegedly used to rent the Ryder truck . <p> McVeigh 's lawyers plan to challenge the credibility of the couple , who have admitted to using illegal drugs . The defense will also challenge the government 's other eyewitnesses , at least two of whom have changed or amended their stories in the past 23 months . <p> Within a day of the blast , employees at Elliott 's told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he rented the truck . At least one of the employees , mechanic Tom Kessinger , described the second man  --  dubbed John Doe No.2  --  as dark-skinned , beefy and wearing a baseball hat . After conducting a worldwide manhunt , the government said in a brief last fall that Kessinger was thinking about an Army private who had been in the shop a day earlier when he helped the FBI craft its now-famous sketch . <p> " If he was mistaken about John Doe No. 2 , then perhaps he was mistaken about John Doe No.1 , " Jones said . <p> Indeed , Jones is certain to attack Kessinger 's claim that Robert Kling is McVeigh . Kling , Kessinger has said , was 5-foot-10 , 185 pounds , with green eyes and acne . McVeigh , his lawyers maintain , is 6-foot-2 , weighs 165 , has a clear complexion and blue eyes . <p> Phone Records <p> Prosecutors have painstakingly pieced together records from a telephone calling card in the name of Daryl Bridges that they allege McVeigh purchased , and that he and Nichols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A copy of the records obtained by The Washington Post shows " Bridges " in regular contact with Nichols in April 1995 . Most damaging to McVeigh , government sources charge , are calls McVeigh allegedly made in September 1994 to chemical companies and fuel and plastic barrel suppliers , looking for the materials that would make up the bomb . <p> Court documents indicate that prosecutors will draw particular attention to a call made April 14 , 1995 , from a Junction City bus depot to Elliott 's . The government alleges that McVeigh made the call to inquire about renting the Ryder truck . <p> Jones plans to challenge all 684 calls on the card , arguing that because they were placed through the calling card company 's 800 number , it is impossible to trace them with any degree of certainty . Government sources point out that because McVeigh used his personal identification number , the calls were not difficult to track . More challenging , however , will be proving that McVeigh was in the cities from which the calls were made . <p> Physical Evidence <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McVeigh to the bombing through such physical evidence as his fingerprint on a fertilizer receipt , the presence of explosive residue on his clothing and a knife and earplugs in his possession at the time of his arrest . <p> The defense team believes that will give them an opening to conduct a trial within a trial of the FBI 's once-vaunted lab , the subject of a two-year inspector general 's investigation into complaints that sloppy procedures had frequently resulted in the tainting of evidence . <p> The results of the inquiry have not been made public , but have been made available to the defense . A source close to the defense said that " the forensic problems prosecutors had with the O.J. Simpson case are nothing in comparison . " <p> Prosecutors are hoping that Judge Richard P. Matsch will prohibit Jones from putting the FBI lab on trial . McVeigh 's attorneys failed to convince the judge to schedule a pretrial hearing on the issue after the government argued that not a single piece of evidence to be introduced at the bombing trial was ever contaminated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his case could be the sentencing phase  --  virtually another trial to address the death penalty  --  as relatives of the victims are called to describe their losses . But unlike the O.J. Simpson criminal trial , these proceedings will not be televised because this is a federal case . Most Americans will follow the case through the filter of the nearly 2,000 journalists who are descending on Denver to cover the trial .
