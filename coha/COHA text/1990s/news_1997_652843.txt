<p> Of the hundreds of thousands of people who visit the Southeast Asian galleries at the Metropolitan Museum each year , no one ever questioned the origins of a 10th-century head of Shiva that was displayed among the buddhas , bodhisattvas and other deities . Neither the scores of world-renowned experts familiar with the galleries nor the Asian dignitaries who made special visits to tour them expressed concern or curiosity about how the head , or any of the other rare objects on display , got to the museum . <p> Alarm bells first sounded in 1993 when Martin Lerner , the Met 's curator of South and Southeast Asian art , saw what appeared to be the same head in a publication called " 100 Missing Objects : Looting in Angkor . " Published in September of that year by the International Council of Museums , a Unesco agency based in Paris , the report was distributed to curators and dealers , collectors , customs officials and the police . <p> " I started to peruse it , and to my horror there was what appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last month , after years of delay and discussion , Mr. Lerner returned the head to the Cambodian Government at the museum 's expense . <p> It was not the only missing object Mr. Lerner shepherded back to Cambodia . He also took with him another head , this one from the 11th century , that had been withdrawn from a sale last summer at Sotheby 's in New York after it , too , was spotted in the council 's booklet . <p> Tracing how works of art are smuggled out of places like Cambodia and end up in museums , private collections , auction houses and galleries is a difficult , often frustrating process . Such smuggling is on the rise and is causing increasing concern among art experts and reputable dealers . A large exhibition of Khmer art that opened in February at the Grand Palais in Paris and will travel to the National Gallery of Art in Washington , the Metropolitan Museum of Tokyo and the Municipal Museum of Arts in Osaka , Japan , is sure to raise the public 's awareness . <p> Recent allegations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian temples  --  allegations made in a British television series timed to a book , " Sotheby 's : The Inside Story , " written by Peter Watson , a London-based reporter  --  have prompted both Sotheby 's and Christie 's to review their practices . ( Five of the 100 missing objects are known to have passed through Sotheby 's offices in New York or in London . Some were actually been sold at auction ; others were withdrawn from sales when it was discovered that their provenances were uncertain . ) Sotheby 's said in a statement that it was aware of governmental investigations in Italy and India arising from " certain allegations in the book " and added that it was working with those authorities . <p> Add to this the fact that the market for Asian art has never been stronger , with record sales reported last month at both the auctions and at the International Asian Art Fair at the Seventh Regiment Armory in New York . <p> " Looting is a worldwide phenomenon that is increasing everyday , " said Elizabeth des Portes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Things are being taken from archeological sites , from churches , from castles , and in some countries , museums are being emptied . Many of these works are appearing on the market . " Ms. des Portes said the council did not play a police role , but that she is trying to stop the illicit traffic of cultural property by making everyone in the art world more aware of the problem . <p> And with some success . Since she first published the paperback , 6 of the 100 missing have been found . ( An updated edition with more missing objects has just come out . ) But for every piece that is returned to Cambodia , there are dozen of questions that will probably remain unanswered . <p> In the case of the Met 's head , no one is sure how the object , which has been valued at $150,000 , left the conservation depot in the town of Siem Reap , about four miles from Angkor . <p> " We know only that the piece was stored in the Angkor conservation reserves up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said a spokesman for the Minister of State for Culture and Fine Arts in Cambodia . " Like a number of other valuable statues , it was surrounded by reinforced concrete and covered in sandbags before the conservation was definitively abandoned in 1973 . As the country was virtually closed to the outside world during the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979 , we know of no art traffic during that period . It was not until the Vietnamese occupation in 1979 that the international traffic of Khmer objects took hold . " <p> What exists is an inventory , along with photographs , made before the war by members of the Ecole Francaise d'Extreme Orient , an organization based in Hanoi and Paris that , among other things , has conducted research throughout the former French Indochina on pieces kept in national repositories like the conservation depot in Siem Reap and the National Museum in Phnom Penh . The head was recorded along with a body that officials in Cambodia say belongs to it . <p> Being sure it was the same piece posed problems . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly battered nose . The head that was in the Met had a nose that is perfectly formed . Before it came to the museum , the piece underwent some cosmetic restoration , hence the new nose . Experts say the restoration was done in London , probably for the dealer trying to sell it . <p> To verify that it was the same piece , Mr. Lerner immediately contacted the international council ( which works with Interpol . ) And in 1995 he visited the Siem Reap depot and talked to officials there . " They had slightly better photographs than the ones that appear in the publication , " he said . " There was really no doubt in my mind it was the same piece . Despite the chipping , the nose is formed the same way , and the surface decoration was the same too . " <p> But Mr. Lerner warned that there was really no way to tell if the piece was actually stolen . " We do n't know whether high officials , members of the royal family or ruling generals had gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's my understanding that in some cases these kinds of objects were intended for gifts to important people . We know that things have been taken out , and I was told that in one instance there were two sculptures removed from the depot with the intention of giving one to a visiting President  --  it could have been either Eisenhower or Nixon . " <p> Both Mr. Lerner and Ms. des Portes also said that in some cases there was desecration of temples . There are places where one sees bullet holes or graffiti attributed to troops stationed in Angkor . There are also instances where vandals hacked off a head or any portable body part that appeared to be salable . Smuggling is still going on . <p> Smuggled objects take a fairly predictable route : some could have been accidentally dug up by farmers , then passed to middlemen who would enlist someone in the military to transport the objects m to the border of either Thailand or Vietnam . " At the border there are often agents that know in advance when the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once it is picked up at the Thai border , it is normally brought to Bangkok , which is the center of international trade . " <p> Ms. des Portes said that even today " smuggling routes through Thailand still exist run by organized rings who supply the international market . " <p> Which is how these pieces end up in places like the Met . Before the museum accepted the gift in 1985 , Mr. Lerner said , he reviewed all the available literature . " As a matter of course , we carefully review everything to make sure we 're not putting either the donor or the museum in an embarrassing situation , " he said . " At the time , everything appeared to be all right . " <p> The Met refuses to disclose who the donor was , saying he wishes to remain anonymous . Officials at the museum are also vague about where the donor bought the head , saying only that it was from a " reputable dealer in Europe . " But in Europe during those years there were not many dealers selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sons , in London . Anthony Gardner , who was the head of its Southeast Asian department in the 1970 's and mid-1980 's , is dead . Michael Spink , who worked for the gallery then and is still there , is not sure if the piece was sold through the firm . " I was n't in that department at the time , " he said . " And our records are scanty . " <p> Information is also scant about the five pieces that passed through Sotheby 's offices in New York or London . A torso of a female deity sold at Sotheby 's in New York in 1992 for $63,250 was bought by a collector living in Switzerland . When it was discovered to be one of the missing objects , the previous owner , Doris Weiner , a New York dealer , bought it back and has made arrangements to have it returned to Cambodia . <p> Another piece , a three-faced sandstone head of Brahma sold at Sotheby 's in London four years ago , has been returned to Cambodia by art dealers living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bequeathed the object to them . And Sotheby 's withdrew two architectural fragments from its London sales in October after it was told by Asian experts how inappropriate it was to accept for sale elements taken from Cambodian temples . <p> " We have had some problems in London , " said Diana D. Brooks , Sotheby 's chief executive worldwide . " It 's a very difficult issue . We 're looking seriously into any departments where these problems have occurred . " <p> The head that Mr. Lerner returned to Cambodia came from Sotheby 's in New York . Carlton Rochell , who heads Sotheby 's Asian department here , said that the piece was withdrawn from the sale when it was spotted in the council publication . It had been taken from a Cambodian temple , was sold in Hong Kong in the 1980 's and was brought to the United States last year . It was bought by a collector from the Middle West who then put it up for sale at Sotheby 's . When the auction house realized it was one of the 100 missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mr. Rochell said : " There 's a legitimate market here , but we have to be awfully careful . I now send catalogues to I.C.O.M. and to the International Foundation for Art Research . " <p> The drive to warn both professionals and the public about missing objects continues . The museum council is selling its publication at the Khmer show in Paris , and it will also be on sale at in Washington at the National Gallery of Art . ( Proceeds from the sales are going to the National Museum in Phnom Penh . ) <p> Meanwhile , both the Khmer head from the Met and the one Mr. Lerner returned from Sotheby 's were presented to Prince Norodom Ranariddh , the co-Prime Minister , and Vann Molyvann , the Minister of State for Culture and Fine Arts , in a ceremony in Phnom Penh . Officials there said the heads would go on view in Phnom Penh at the National Museum , along with the other objects recently returned to Cambodia .
