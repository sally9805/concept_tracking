A Benedictine chronicler once wrote of a " white mantle of churches " stretched across medieval France . In a related way , America in the past century has mantled itself with museums , as the temple of art gradually replaced the church as the emblematic focus of civic self-esteem . Now , two grand projects by leading American architects , utterly different from each other in purpose , appearance and design philosophy , may be said to mark the climax of the age of American museum expansion . One is in Los Angeles and opens officially in December  --  though small flotillas of previewing VIPS have been trawling through it for the past few months . The other , already open , is under American management but is set in Bilbao , in the Basque region of northern Spain . Neither is likely to have any architectural rivals in what is left of the 20th century , or for a good slice of the early 21st . <P> In Los Angeles , after 14 years , the Leviathan surfaces at last : Moby Museum , a.k.a. the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugged honey-colored Italian travertine , nearly 1 million sq . ft. of it at roughly $1,000 per sq . ft. , designed by Richard Meier and perched on a 710-acre hilltop above the San Diego Freeway in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles . The Getty is the most expensive arts complex and by some calculations the most expensive building in American history . Large expectations ride on it as both a cultural institution and an emblematic focus for Los Angeles itself . Meanwhile , Frank Gehry 's $100 million Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao opened two weeks ago . Built and financed by the Basque regional government , it is essentially a franchise : a major step in the effort by Thomas Krens , director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York City , to parlay his museum into an international network of satellites exhibiting art from a common pool  --  an innovative idea that is still viewed with a good deal of skepticism by more traditional museum officials . <P> The Getty is not " a building . " There are moments , both off site and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge linked by plazas and terraces resembles a very honed and buffed Modernist version of an Italian hill town . Architect Meier himself has grown wary of the hill-town analogy . " Think of it , " he says , " as a small college campus with different departments , some more visible than others  --  not a museum but an institution in which art predominates . " <P> Meier , 63 , has come up with a superb piece of place making . When the Epcot-style tram delivers you from the parking garage at the bottom to the plaza at the top of the ridge , you step out into a space that seems both amiable and Utopian , dignified but , despite its acreage of travertine , not authoritarian : a respite from the visual chaos of Los Angeles , but offering the best views a public could have of the city spread below .
