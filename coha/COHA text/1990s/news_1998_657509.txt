<p> The most popular videotape at Jordan 's Royal Palace today may be one from 1992 . When King Hussein returned home after a month away , having won a bout with illness , tens of thousands of cheering Jordanians lined the long route from the airport to the palace , sometimes stopping the impromptu royal procession . But even as the monarch last week marked 46 years as ruler of the Hashemite Kingdom , he was in Minnesota undergoing treatment that will most likely keep him out of the country until the end of the year . The situation has Jordanians looking at the question of succession . It also underscores a string of leadership changes likely to occur across the region in the coming years as the men who for decades have ruled - often with iron fists - and defined the modern Middle East give way to a younger generation . The coming changes also highlight how autocratic Mideast regimes are bucking the democratic trend that has swept Eastern Europe , crept through Africa and Latin America , and shown glimmers in Asia . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heir to the throne , Jordan 's future holds many problems that have already stretched the talents of the charismatic King Hussein . The economy is depressed , democratic progress of recent years has regressed on some critical fronts , and the near-total collapse of the Arab-Israeli peace process has meant Jordan 's 1994 peace treaty with Israel has yielded few dividends and a lot of public antipathy . After so many years on the throne , up to 80 percent of the population knows no other leader . But the crown prince 's job , and his eventual role as king , will require deft handling to overcome these problems , analysts say , and to ensure that US-ally Jordan continues to play a big regional role . " You do n't want a manager , " says a well-placed Jordanian , regarding the complexities . " What you need is an alchemist . " The brothers are in almost daily contact . " The king is not a man who is disengaged and fighting for his life , " says a Western diplomat . " He may be ailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king had earlier tried to calm anxieties back home by television : " Rest assured , " he told Jordanians . " I am not over and done with . " Still , Jordanians and diplomats say that Hassan - though often portrayed as an aloof intellectual with little common touch - has the necessary support from the three groups that count : the Army , the security services , and Bedouins , who have long been loyal to the Hashemite family , which is directly descended from the Prophet Muhammad . He speaks as deliberately as his brother , and with tones almost as deep . But his humorous side is rarely seen in public . " It 's unfair to assess what kind of king Hassan is going to be , because he has n't been able to strut his stuff , " says the Western diplomat . " His cross will be living in the shadow of an all-embracing , generous , charismatic man about whom no Jordanian can think of life without . " <p> Casting long shadows That shadow applies to other long-surviving Mideast leaders as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political landscape . The spate of coups and countercoups that plagued the region in the 1950s and 1960s - King Hussein himself survived at least a dozen assassination attempts in his first 25 years in power - are now more likely to be replaced by attrition. * Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , for example , has been buffeted by Mideast politics since the 1960s , and negotiated the 1993 Oslo peace accord with Israel against the will of hard-line groups . The collapse of the peace process - and subsequent rise in the fortunes of Mr. Arafat 's toughest Palestinian opponents - seems to have taken a heavy toll on his health . " Arafat is the big one , " says Mustafa Hamarneh , director of the Center for Strategic Studies at the University of Jordan . " If he goes , you have a problem , because he 's the only one who can negotiate and deal with the Israelis . " * King Fahd of Saudi Arabia , who has been frail and ailing for years , underwent major surgery this month . Crown Prince Abdullah is believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicate American military arrangements in the Persian Gulf . Even the assassination of King Faisal by a junior member of the Saud family in 1975 reportedly did not shake the political system , but the still-unsolved Khobar Towers bombing against US servicemen in 1996 points toward some internal dissent . There have also been hints that Saudi exile Osama bin Laden was involved in that attack . He has made numerous threats against Americans and is suspected of having financed the US Embassy bombings in Africa . He has been stripped of his citizenship and is believed to be hiding in Afghanistan . Aging sheikhs are also at the helm in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates . When Qatar 's reform-minded young prince , Hamad bin Khalifa , ousted his father the emir in 1995 , he transformed the country overnight with a new foreign policy and did away with many internal restrictions . * In Syria , President Hafez al-Assad 's health has been an issue many times since he came to power in a 1970 coup . Only Mr. Assad , analysts say , would be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any concessions at all on the Golan Heights , which Israel occupied in 1967 . Since favored son Basil was killed in a 1994 car crash , Assad has groomed his second son , Bashar , to ensure that their ethnic Alawite minority keeps its grip on power . * Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak is in good health , but has ruled with an authoritarian hand since he came to power after Anwar Sadat 's 1981 assassination . Mr. Mubarak survived an assassination attempt in 1995 , but has refused to appoint a vice president , a move that might ensure a smooth succession . * The demise of Iraq 's Saddam Hussein , in power since 1979 , has been anticipated since the 1991 Gulf War sparked uprisings in the country . An assassination attempt against son Uday in Baghdad in 1996 injured the likely heir and left the succession picture uncertain . " If Saddam Hussein dies or collapses , it could be a bloodbath , " Mr. Hamarneh says . Congress has directed President Clinton to take more active measures to undermine Saddam Hussein 's rule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed 73 opposition groups to turn into a " viable " replacement regime . But despite eight years of United Nations sanctions and occasional US military strikes , Saddam Hussein is firmly in charge . <p> Islam and democracy Though all these regimes follow the Islamic faith , Islam is not incompatible with democracy . Mideast analysts more often attribute authoritarian rule to historical tradition . Both Iran and Turkey are democracies , with limits . But secular regimes interfering to stymie budding Islamist power - witness the violence in Algeria - only follow democratic norms when it suits them . Back in Jordan , which has made some democratic progress , the intrigues of all these Mideast actors sometimes play themselves out in the form of assassination attempts , murders , and intelligence and diplomatic head-butting , to the point where some suggest that Jordan is becoming like Beirut in the 1970s : a place where Mideast groups settle their scores . Clues to the crown prince 's future may be on display when King Hussein returns , and compares the reception with his tumultuous 1992 welcome home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a civil war in his time , but was able to draw the line and bring people back to him , " says another Western diplomat . " The transition will be smooth , then there will be a proving time . "
