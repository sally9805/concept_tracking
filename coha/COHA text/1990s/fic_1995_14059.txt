Scene hole : An urban street corner just at the end of twilight . Shadows of tall buildings cut across our view . Street and sidewalk and the light of a looming half-moon . A strange , misshapen SILHOUETTE , with shadow , appears and we hear whatever it is speak in a deep , husky half-whisper as VOICE-OVER : NARRATOR I suppose you would like to know who I am , and if not " who " then " what " . PauseThere is a problem with this . PauseI do n't know what I am , and I am not sure there is a " Who " to be found there . or here , I mean . PauseThis worries me . PauseThis worries me because well . Let 's just say , it worries me , and leave it at that . PauseWhen I was young I had no problems with this attribute of my physiognomy . PauseI was going to say " when I was a kid " , but I 'm not sure that 's accurate . PauseYou see , I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a piece of rotten fruit . PauseMy origin was amazement . PauseI look up at the moon and witness the light of my beginning . Folks are afraid of me . Maybe they have good reason to be . Shadow of a claw scratching a horny head . We hear scratching noises.My origin was in the bright , bright cup of radiance that is starlight . How else could I have come into being ? How else ? A LITTLE MAN comes up with a cigarette . LITTLE MANHey , bud , got a light ? Sees the whole , vast bulk of our NARRATOR and freezes in terror . As the latter 's shadow swoops over the MAN , we hear a crunching noise . The shadow withdraws and the little MAN is squashed flat . p. 3 NARRATOR I do n't like interruptions , as you may have noticed . Particularly when I am talking about my origins . Alone of all things my origins are dear to me . We hear an ambulance , and see people scurrying about.All I recall of my youth , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing in the middle of a forest . Birds were singing there , deep in the heart of the woods . I was smaller then , not so large and bulky . A strange , sharp wiggle of a shadow . PauseAt times I felt as though I possessed a tail . At times I felt as if I were a tail . The tail wagging the dog of some other existence . PauseNowadays it is difficult for me even to turn around so I can not be sure whether I possess a tail , or am one . PauseIf I am one , whatever I am the tail of must be a prodigious monster , a true swamp gahoon . PauseI crept into the city via the Holland Tunnel . Crept in from a region where paperclips evolve into coathangers , a world of nocturnal cobwebbery . PauseObviously I had to be very careful . PauseI did not want to attract too much attention so I chose the wee hours of the night for my entrance and arrival . PauseEven so , I was the occasion of much amazement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand myself . You others who also seek self-understanding surely can appreciate the knot of my conundrum . What is self , after all , but the series of approximate responses to the darksome shadow of self , the abyss of being ? Being . Are we not all mere reflections of of that primordial starburst of amazement ? Are we not all formed from our own dense , unfathomable drives and the myriad reactions occasioned in others by these ? Do we not all share the same original stereo-panopticon ? Perhaps . Perhaps not . PauseMy search for my self has been arduous , difficult to describe . A hollow within a cube within another hollow . All the people , dogs and cats have by now fled , leaving only their shadows . These merge with our NARRATOR 's . Like a bag full of cats it changes shape continually.That brings me to the point of my tale : my shadow , apparently exasperated by my difficult nature , unpleasant appearance and sheer superficial discontinuity went stark raving mad . My shadow broke off from me and merged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  those I had terrorized  --  the mob . His shadow alters , becoming an oscillating imp of zany complexity , as if alive.What could I do ? Nothing but look on from the filamentous crack of whatever was left of me and the dark substance of my dematerialized dark side  --  my id . Waiting for the moment to make myself whole once more . Waiting for the moment to strike . And yet , I did not have to wait long . The shadow breaks up into a series of nine smaller shadows , arranged in three rows of three . In turn , each of these darkens . The body of darkness drains out of each , as they are transformed , one by one , into holes.The fragments of my shadow had become a crowd of kneeling holes , like an orderly array of ardent disciples . Worshipping . But , Lord knows , before what craven idol did they worship ? PausePerhaps it was the haze of moonlight . Moonlight that recalls us to focus , distance , and the love that permeates all cavities so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fissures on the sidewalks and roadbeds , the texture of these surfaces like the hand of a familiar acquaintance ; perhaps it was the moon itself , for all the world like an immaterial being  --  herself adrift ; perhaps it was the empty space the moon and heavens are filled with , nameless fillers , nameless bodies of figures and grounds ; I hardly knew . Indeed the holes are bowing slowly now before the silhouette of our now shadowless NARRATOR . He groans.I may be wrong , but but I think they are worshipping me . My disciples . PauseAmazing . PauseSuddenly , however , it occurred to me that I , too , am an empty  --  a vessel of absence . The merest inscription of nothingness , and as I realized this , I could literally smell fear . PauseI could smell fear and terror , twin companions like my former shadow , and my inability to escape the pseudo-solid into which I had been poured . This oddly framed identity of mine : A hollow within a cube within another hollow . The entire puppet theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasped at , like Orpheus at Eurydice . Shadow of an arm and hand . Shadow of girl receding . A far away scream.Stranger yet , when I reached out to touch my disciples crouched before me , crouched before me neatly , in three rows of three , my fingers could not feel feel anything there . We see the shadows deepen as obvious holes.I closed my eyes , and the tips of my fingers sought out lovingly the shapes of those who worshipped me , whom I also loved . I reached for them , but they were gone ; each shadow fallen into the mystery of its own distinct but arbitrary  --  unfathomable  --  hole . A cloud passes over the moon . The motionless holes rest motionlessly.I realized I would have to follow them wherever they had gone . So : I selected one ( according to the ancient Rule of Hollow and Shadow ) while observing too the contradictory laws of my own nature A flock of storks flies past the moon . A lone stork flies into the hole of the moon.I went in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PauseFor whatever it was I was looking for was bigger game than a mere question of nested holes . A gloved hand reaches out and rolls a marble into one of the holes . Slow black out as the music fades @x Scene depression : The same as before , only the moon is now 3/4s full . A rat runs across the street . A cat appears right behind , stalking . Both freeze . Head lights appear , and both scurry off . A sedan drives up , stops , parks . A man gets out , and a woman . They embrace , and the man waits till she gets in the door of her apartment . A light comes on in a window above , the woman appears and waves . The man waves back and returns to his car . Drives off  --  the shadow of the sedan remains , looks about and thus notices other , similarly orphaned shadows . We hear our familiar NARRATOR as voice-over : NARRATOR The shadowy epigones of my own , nearly perfect shadow had become a schizophrenic multitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the act of of worship . PauseIf this be true , before what brazen image did they fawn ? CHORUS OF SHADOWS We worship the solid that blocks out light , spooky ; We worship the tree branch , flickering schematically against the hole of the moon , spooky ; We worship the wall , obdurate and unyielding like the will of the Evil One , spooky ; We worship the sun-hat , sun-glasses and sun-block of the sun-blinded , very cool yet unaccountable , and spooky ; We worship the roof of the adjoining warehouse , dim in the caverns of night , spooky ; We worship the passing automobile , with its evanescent shadow , spooky ; We worship the rushing dog , with its long , frightening arabesque of shadow , quite spooky ; We worship what shades us from our destroyer , X , the Light . p. 6 A SINGLE CHORISTER The Primal Shadow , and Father of our amazement , loved to sit in the moonlight and talk with the moon . THE OLDEST SHADOW Hello , Moon , my old friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? THE OLDEST SHADOW What do you mean " What are you doing down there " ? I am keeping all things hinged to the doors and windows of customary appearance . What are you doing up there ? MOON Would n't you like to know , you mediocre non-entity . NARRATOR Perhaps , I thought to myself , it is the haze of the moonlight that recalled me to focus , distance , and the twisted love that permeates all cavities so filled ; perhaps it is the detail of cracks and fissures on the sidewalks and roadbeds , the texture of these surfaces like the wrinkled hand of a familiar acquaintance ; perhaps , it is only the moon , for all the world like an immaterial being , herself adrift ; perhaps , it is the dark matter the emptiness of the heavens is filled with CHORUS We , nameless fillers , nameless bodies of figure and ground ; he hardly knew which . NARRATOR I may be wrong , but but I think they are worshipping me , my sweet , but lunatic disciples . p. 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hear a strange and spooky laughter as the shadows begin turning into holes . NARRATOR Suddenly it occurred to me that I too must be unredeemably empty , a vessel of absence . The merest inscription of nothingness and and as I came to this rude realization I could smell fear . A wolf howls , a bat crosses the moon . The moon drips blood . Pause.I could smell fear and terror  --  the twin familiars of my haunted , topological obsession  --  and my inability to escape from this nightmarish cabinet of illusion to which I had been exiled seemed an unassailable fact . For now , even without my shadow , I glimmered , glimmered in the faint pseudo-solid chiaroscuro of my inner theater . And the shadowy knowledge that I had grasped at The entire puppet theater suddenly fills with light then darkens. had become Eurydice , the spectral girl haunted Orpheus reached for in vain . Shadow of an arm and hand . Shadow of girl receding . A faraway scream.Stranger yet , when I reached out to touch I could not feel anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovingly sought out the shapes of those who worshipped me , whom I adored .

A lone pelican flies into the hole of the moon.I went in search of whatever it was I was looking for . A hand reaches out and rolls a marble into a hole . Total black : PauseI enter one of the holes and encounter the world of infrared . Everything bursts into brightest scarlet , Infrared . We hear strange infrared music . The scene is the same , only different . There are people milling about . One of them , a young WOMAN and her dog . The WOMAN sits down at a park bench to read a book . Her shadow is a monster shadow . She looks at her hands oddly , but makes nothing of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doggy ways , notices something has changed . But what ? p. 8 CATHY X Wow , what 's wrong ? You look like you 've seen a ghost . WOW Look at me , I 'm different . All of a sudden everything looks different too . And your shadow ! Someone must have flipped the switch and slipped over from the Other Side . Cathy , Cathy But she 's reading her book . Now the infrared shape of our NARRATOR looms up just in front of the two . WOW is anxious about this.Oh , it 's you . One of the big ones from the Other Side . Uh-oh . Neither one of us is of any importance . I 'm an ordinary dog with ordinary proclivities . Named " Wow " . She 's an ordinary dog-owner of no importance . Named " Cathy X " . Neither of us knows anything about anything pertaining to the Other Side , and we possess no abnormal proclivities . Ordinary girl . Dog . Ordinary proclivities . Really . NARRATOR An ordinary dog by the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimidated in the least . CATHY X How did you know his name ? That 's his name , but how did you know it ? Are you psychic ? I have a friend down in Jersey City whose first cousin has a Weimaraner named " Wow " . She 's psychic . Sandy Adler is her name , and she was married to Pat Riley 's brother-in-law  --  Pat Riley of the Knicks ? Only he 's not manager of the Knicks no more . You follow basketball ? I do n't follow basketball . You can call me Cathy . p. 9 WOW Cathy X. CATHY X Do n't bark at the man , Wow . He may be psychic . NARRATOR That shadow  --  CATHY X Say hello to the man , Wow . Suddenly noticing.Wow , he 's kinda 've a big guy WOW How do you do ? CATHY X Wow is an extraordinary dog .

NARRATOR Madame , I have no interest in you . But there is a matter I wish to take up with your semblable . CATHY X Semblable ?

I 'm sorry , but there 's nothing I can do . Pause . Our NARRATOR turns away in despair . NARRATOR In my despair , I turned away from Cathy X. I turned away from her shadow . I turned away even , from her dog , " Wow " . I made a prayer to my aloneness : PauseO Holy One , X , My Destroyer and Saviour , Please take away the shoesOf those who opened my eyesTo the radiance of Infrared.Remind them of my presenceSo I may grow another shadowAs dark as the one theystole from me in my innocence.Place them in the hole of TimeAlong with Time 's junk . Pause@@ Scene groove : Full , red moon . Same as before : CATHY X , her SHADOW , WOW , and our NARRATOR ; also , life-size in adjoining dioramas , CATHY X herself , and behind a scrim , the dim and menacing figure of our NARRATOR .

NARRATOR You know who I am , and why I 'm here . Do n't play stupid . CATHY X All I know is you 're as big as a house , and you do n't look right . You do n't even look human . CATHY X 'S SHADOW That 's the way . The classic counter-punch . Ask him is he human ? Do it . CATHY X Are you human ? What are you ? You 're not , are you ? NARRATOR Maybe . Maybe I 'm not . CATHY X 'S SHADOW " Maybe " ! Ha ! NARRATOR Maybe in your terms I am an an aberration of nature . p. 13 CATHY X 'S SHADOW That 's a dandy circumlocution . Do n't you mean " a monster " ?

She 's clean , polite and tidy , not to mention politically naive . NARRATOR I do not understand  --  what is this thing called " politically naive " ? WOW Downtown theater .

SHADOW OF THE FLATIRON BUILDING You have dug a trench of ignorance around yourselves , and climbed down into it . WOW backs off in terror and is devoured by CATHY X 's SHADOW . This event is witnessed by a passerby , an OLD MAN , who yells in alarm . An OLD WOMAN is attracted by the commotion and rushes up . CATHY X Wow , where are you ?

It tries to make itself small . p. 18 CATHY X 'S SHADOW What are you staring at ? I did n't do anything . Cut it out . MOON Yes , it is your own shadow that is the most peculiar , is it not ?

CATHY X 'S SHADOW You have lost your shadow because of a defect of the soul . NARRATOR A defect of the soul ? CATHY X 'S SHADOW A thing lacking in your spacio-temporal identity .

CATHY X 'S SHADOW No , for even you shall be redeemed by Our Saviour . NARRATOR Our Saviour ? ! Ha Ha ha . I lost my faith way back , along with my cornball innocence . All that 's a fraud .

CATHY X 'S SHADOW Her name is Catherine X no more ; She is now a Catherine wheel of our Salvation ; X , the criss-cross of the Mini-Maximal ; X , the site of our human transcendence , and our passing over into Wild Time ; X , where shadow and hole are annihilated in the love which possesseth no moniker . NARRATOR This is uncanny  --  now I 'm even more scared than before . The DARK FIGURE pauses , then re-enters the hole of CATHY 'S SHADOW.Damnation . Now I 'm lost . Forever . A giant fist smashes on the pavement . A cat leaps from roof to roof . A dog below barks . A horde of evil insects skitter across the street as a cloud passes over the face of the moon .

PauseAND so I came out of a world on the Other Side in order to redeem you all , the lost ones from the folly of your ways ; for it is the folly and wretchedness of the inhabitants of Infrared that you are always mistaking wrong for right ; just as you mistake holes for shadows and shadows for holes . PauseAND it is my task to set the matter right and show you the way to redemption is paved with the stones of mercy and forgiveness , stones which sparkle like the scales of the dragon NARRATOR Pardon me .

PauseCONSIDER what it is the inchworm measures with his ridiculous lurch-and-drag walk ; he measures his way down the aeons of unproof ; he measures nothing that is not a thought of God ; he measures his life that it may be shared with all ; he shares his joy with sensitive touches ; he shares his finitude with all the great works of infinity ; he measures the love of Time for the small motions of the soul , ever-seeking , ever-grasping , ever-blind .

CATHY X Study refinement and the relation between the insane zigzag of the inchworm 's shadow and the tidiness of the inchworm 's hole . WOW has been sniffing at the inchworm and now begins barking at it.Wow , stop it . Wow . NARRATOR But I have lost my shadow  --  or someone has stolen it ; I have stepped into a hole of deep despair ; I have followed a tunnel of despair till I have found my way here . CATHY X If you would but surrender your shadow to its fate , it would not be changed into to a hole . NARRATOR Holes frighten me , CATHY X Holes are friends . They mark the way out . NARRATOR The way out of what ? CATHY X Out of our common woe . NARRATOR Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X My message is a simple one : Give away everything you own , and take to the open road preaching the gospel of mercy and forgiveness . NARRATOR aside.But as X spoke , a strange thing happened in my heart of hearts : I realized suddenly that if she were X , I must be Y , a Judas-man and the type of the True Destroyer ; I realized That I was an imp  --  the true quintessential imp of Double Negative ; I realized , in my desperate aloneness , that it was to be my lot to kiss her . To kiss X upon the cheek and so betray her . He kisses her . A brief commotion . It stops . All people , animals , shadows and holes stare at him , astonished . p. 28 CATHY X So : it is you . NARRATOR I did not know it until now CATHY X So : you are the one . NARRATOR I have betrayed you . CATHY X Tell me , Monsoor Y , for that must be your name , why have you done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betray me ? NARRATOR I do not know why . And that is the whole of it . And the shadow of the whole of it shall cut crookedly across the ruined fortress of my face for all time . CATHY X You do not know why , and that is the whole of it . She kisses him back . WOW barks.I forgive you , Monsoor Y , though you have murdered me . End of scene . All fades as we drift out of the world of infrared. @x Scene tunnel : Same as before . Just before dawn . The red moon is far on the wane ; it tilts on its side , as though the wind had blown it over . NARRATOR But as X spoke a strange thing happened in my heart of hearts : I realized suddenly that if she were X , I was Y , a Judas-man and the true type of the Destroyer . I realized that I was an insidious , perverted imp  --  the quintessential Imp of ultimate Double Negative . I realized in my desperate aloneness that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so betray her . CATHY X So : it is you . NARRATOR I did not know it was me until now . CATHY X So : you are the one . NARRATOR I have betrayed you . CATHY X Tell me , tell me , Monsoor Y  --  for that must be your name , why have you done this act ? What harm have I done to you that you would betray me ? NARRATOR I do not know why . And that is the whole of it . And the shadow of the whole of it shall cut crookedly across the ruined fortress of my face till all time and love have come to dust . CATHY X You do not know why , and that is the whole of it . She kisses him back . WOW wags his tail.I forgive you , Monsoor Y , though you have murdered me . She turns away , them turns back.As for my shadow , if you want it so badly you may have it . And surely you will have need of one where you are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please no . What have I done to deserve this ? Anything but this . I 'd rather be effaced for all time by your radiance , than hang off of this no account jerk fucking swamp gahoon this miserable Judas-man . No , no All fades as we drift of the world of Infrared back into ours . NARRATOR As we kissed everything faded from sight , and I drifted out out of the world of Infrared . We 're back home . A hawk flies across the moon . A cat chases a dog across the street.Back home the big city I knew and loved . With its familiar sounds and smells A thick cloud of greasy smoke rolls down the street . A very tall MAN is shooting baskets in an alleyway . A LITTLE MAN with a BIG DOG begins cursing a BIG MAN with a LITTLE DOG . LITTLE MAN Fuck you , Joey , you miserable fuck . I 'll fucking kill you , you stupid fuck . You owe me , Joey , and you 'd better come up with the dough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in Jersey , and these guys would love an excuse to rearrange your face , Joey . Both DOGS begin to piss.You understand what I 'm saying , Joey ? You had better did . That 's all I can say . And that hound of yours , why that is the most miserable excuse of a mutt I 've ever seen . Is that some kind of a grotesque growth on his face ? Just looking at that mutt is enough to make me want to puke . The BIG MAN knocks over the LITTLE MAN , and begins to kick him till the latter lies still . As the LITTLE DOG chews on the fallen MAN 's pant-leg , the BIG DOG attacks the BIG MAN and drives him away . All through this the other MAN continues shooting baskets . People appear in windows and shout : p. 31 ANGRY INSOMNIACS a ) Hey , keep it down ! b ) Shut up , you hooligan ! Vicious swine ! c ) Do you mind ? I 'm trying to get some sleep ! A HOMELESS PERSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shoes and carefully removes them . As he does : music begins , heralding the first light of dawn in the East . A man-hole in the street pops up and bright light flashes up . One by one , the disciples of X , the Destroyer and Saviour , appear and set up a long table for the Holy Banquet . Our NARRATOR talks over this : NARRATOR I never did figure out who or what I am . Guess I do n't mind too much . You do n't really need to know ; at least not for most purposes at life 's little puppet show He laughs drily.And besides , I might turn out to be something something not all that appetizing and would n't that be an embarrassment ? Anyway , I 've got my shadow back , even if  --  let 's just say  --  it 's borrowed , and it 's just as wild and creepy as ever . They 're setting places at the table for the Holy Banquet . X is both Destroyer and Saviour it turns out . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll eat whatever it is along with the rest . No complaints from me . Nosirree . Being damned in one world amounts to being blessed in the next , is the overriding theme of the event . I 'm not too clear on all of this , but I figure I 've got some catching up to do , in the eschatology department . Pause . Our Saviour , Cathy X , appears . Her disciples take charge and begin dressing her for her new role . All this is quite a shock since , unlike the CATHY X of Infrared , she seems unaware of her divine nature . As she is transformed she talks a little with our NARRATOR : p. 32 CATHY X You think you 're perplexed . NARRATOR Sometimes I 'd like world to go away . Both of ' em . PauseMaybe I 've dug a trench of ignorance around myself , and climbed down into it . CATHY X I feel like that a lot too . Stick of gum ? NARRATOR Sure . Thanks . He takes it . Both chew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this current sublet is going to last . I 'd go back home to Mahwah , but my sister 's suicidal , and my brother Richie is a creep . NARRATOR I think I know your brother Richie . CATHY X Everybody knows my brother Richie since he knocked up that slut from Staten Island , Gloria Fishman . Pause NARRATOR Life in the city is hard . CATHY X Life in the city oh well Completes her transformation as disciples place a tiara of candles upon her head . Her miniature at the banquet table stands and delivers the sermon . CATHY X PEOPLE and animals do certain things because they believe they have come across a hole , because they want to dig a hole , to pass through a hole , to jump over a hole , to get out of a hole , or hide inside one She goes on , as before ; but we hear our p. 33 NARRATOR All this seems so strangely familiar to me . All this I know , as if by deja vu , from some other world linked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much I want to learn . So much to learn . Before before they come for me , as I am certain they will . Because of the shadow , the shadow that was not mine , that I brought with me all the way from the world of Infrared In truth , the SHADOW is acting like a bag full of schizophrenic alley cats . An ominous black sedan pulls up . The sedan is filled with dark red light . Two MEN dressed in black get out . They both carry blackjacks and are masked . Our NARRATOR does n't see them , but his shadow does and quakes with fear.I want to learn why a thing can resemble another thing , but not be at all the same ; I want to know where our dreams come from , and how it is possible for us to desire things that injure us , or drive us mad ; I want to know what the true limits of the human condition are  --  and how we are to know when we have gone too far  --  when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to know why I have become so disfigured that I can not bear my own image , and even my own shadow is a visual horror to me ; I want to know what love is , and why when you reach to hold it , it flies off in terror like the uncaged paroquet , confused by sudden freedom ; I want so badly to know why oh why is there anything at all The masked MEN quickly grab him from under his cloak , throw him in a big coal sack , and toss the sack into the trunk of the car . They get in , and hurriedly drive off . Pause Only his SHADOW REMAINS . It speaks in a deep , husky half-whisper as VOICE-OVER : p. 34 NARRATOR 'S SHADOW I suppose you would like to know who I am , and if not " who " then " what " . PauseThere is a problem with this . As he goes on with the speech from the beginning of INFRARED , Lights slowly come down , except on the head of X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :
