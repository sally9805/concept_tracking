At first glance , the business world of the 20th century would not seem a propitious breeding ground for eccentricity . Businessmen and - women , in the main , pride themselves on probity , predictability . " Sober " and " well-rounded " are considered compliments . Little wonder , then , that a hectare of executives contains fewer kooks than just about any other sampling of humanity . Compared with poets and philosophers , bankers and industrialists have been relatively late adopters of berets , ferrets and home brewing . Yet , even so , the century has hatched its share of " true originals "  --  some of whom won fame and fortune , others who left only a gaudy afterglow . <P> The fetishes of Howard Hughes ( 1905-76 ) have entered folklore , to the point that Hughes is remembered less for having been an **40;7381;TOOLONG than for having been a saver of urine ( his own ) , a recluse terrified of dust , a man who , with the right audience ( Mormon bodyguards ) , could n't see Ice Station Zebra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen more labored in obscurity . Who remembers Brian Hughes ? This 1920s box-manufacturing tycoon liked nothing better than to patrol the sidewalk outside Tiffany in New York City , an envelope tucked beneath his arm . When the moment seemed right , and pedestrian traffic sufficient , Hughes would let loose its contents , sending a spray of jewels ( all fake ) clattering across the sidewalk . The melee that ensued never ceased to please him . On rainy days , he would exit a restaurant and deliberately leave behind an expensive umbrella . When opened by a misappropriater , the umbrella released a shower of leaflets saying THIS UMBRELLA STOLEN FROM BRIAN G. HUGHES . <P> For sheer reclusiveness , Hughes ( Howard , not Brian G. ) had a worthy rival in candymaker Forrest Mars Sr. Virtually every detail of Mars ' life  --  including his birthday  --  is kept a closely guarded corporate secret within Mars Inc. , a secretive company . He has reportedly given but one interview in his entire career and that to a candy-industry trade paper in 1966 . Yet even Mars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Basil Zaharoff ( 1849-1936 ) , a munitions king aptly called the " Mystery Man of Europe . " Zaharoff systematically stole or destroyed all records of his youth and early manhood , making snooping into his past impossible . He employed several doubles and never permitted himself to be photographed until late in life , after he had retired . Why such secrecy ? Assassins from many nations hunted him . He had made his fortune by simultaneously selling arms to both sides in a conflict . He grew rich  --  and hated . <P> Certain industries have yielded gushers of eccentrics . Oil gave the world two famous penny-pinching billionaires : J. Paul Getty ( 1892-1976 ) , legendary for forcing guests at his estate to use a pay phone , and H.L. Hunt ( 1889-74 ) , who every day either brought his lunch to work in a paper sack or , when not feeling quite so flush , cadged his secretary 's sandwich . Less well known was oil and cattle baron James ( " Silver Dollar Jim " ) West ( 1903-57 ) . Wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel of one of his 30 automobiles , West loved to race alongside Houston police in pursuit of evildoers , throwing handfuls of silver dollars to startled onlookers as he sped by .
