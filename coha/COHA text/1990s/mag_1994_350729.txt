WHEN JANE ALEXANDER WAS starring in Harold Pinter 's Old Times off-Broadway a decade ago , an unlikely Pinter fan  --  Jackie Gleason  --  went backstage to ask what the play meant . " I do n't know , " Alexander replied . " I 'm not sure even Mr. Pinter does . " Gleason nodded to express his own bafflement , then added , " Hell of an evening though . " <P> That mix of confusion and spellbinding tension is Pinter 's trademark : it is never quite clear what is happening , but whatever it is , it is urgently important . The menacing mysticism reaches a peak in No Man 's Land , a series of drawing-room encounters soured by a barroom aura of impending rough-and- tumble . Like most great playwrights , Pinter keeps writing the same work . No Man 's Land is The Homecoming with fancier furniture , Old Times with more recherche recollections , The Birthday Party with a gentler goon squad . It is also , from a playwright generous to actors , the showiest acting duel in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1976 with John Gielgud as a scruffy but glib old poet and Ralph Richardson as the addled " man of letters " who has invited him home . Last year it resurfaced in London with Pinter in the Richardson part and veteran comic actor Paul Eddington ( TV 's Yes , Minister ) succeeding Gielgud . Last week it returned to Broadway with Jason Robards as the bonhomous householder and Christopher Plummer as his versifying guest . <P> The new production is not the most nuanced of the three but is surely the funniest  --  and the most ambisexual . British director David Jones , a longtime collaborator with Pinter , does not mess with the text , but he does point up homosexual undertones , overtones and just plain tones in the relationships among the two old men and two younger ones who purport to be servants but act like thugs . As usual with Pinter , sexual attraction manifests itself in smidgens of affection and buckets of scorn , and the goal of Eros is the adolescent urge to have something to brag about . The sexual linkages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second act , when the two old men shift from scrutinizing each other as strangers to confronting each other as acquaintances since school days . <P> Robards ' braying and bluster are adroit but familiar . Plummer 's fussiness and dither are a natural outgrowth of the feline , even feminine , nature of many of his heroes ( and most of his villains ) . But his raddled face , Einstein coiffure and teetery walk are new and , surprisingly from this most mannered of actors , feel free of mannerism . The verbal cut and thrust between them is the finest now on Broadway  --  elegantly bloodless and as ferocious as a slaughterhouse .
