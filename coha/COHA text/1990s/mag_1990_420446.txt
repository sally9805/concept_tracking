Section : Special Report ; Cover story <p> U.S. soldiers fought their first major battle in Vietnam a quarter-century ago . Its lessons were ignored , forever changing the war <p> Twenty-five years ago next month , America plunged into its first major battle of the Vietnam War in a remote valley of the Central Highlands . The American reinforcements that Gen. William C. Westmoreland had so urgently sought to stave off disaster in South Vietnam , the superbly equipped 1st Air Cavalry Division , and Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap 's brave foot soldiers of the 325-B Division of the People 's Army of Vietnam fell upon each other in the eerie , unpopulated Ia Drang Valley . Outnumbered 7 to 1 , a battalion of the 7th U.S. Cavalry withstood a dozen human-wave attacks in three days and two nights at the killing ground they called Landing Zone X-Ray . <p> Before the North Vietnamese retreated to Cambodia in late November , 1965 , more than 2,000 Vietnamese and 234 Americans were killed . But the victory proved to be a fatal one , for it helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that U.S. soldiers , using the air cavalry 's search-and-destroy tactics , could hunt down the enemy , grind him up and win the war that America 's South Vietnamese allies were losing . Four days after the Ia Drang fighting ended , Westmoreland cabled Washington that he now faced a conventional war and that only American troops could stand up to the North Vietnamese . <p> Defense Secretary Robert McNamara was less optimistic : After reviewing the results of the Ia Drang battle he sent President Lyndon Johnson a secret memo warning that even if the U.S. tripled the number of troops it sent to Vietnam , it would have no better than a 50-50 chance of winning the war . He was ignored . After the Ia Drang , Vietnam was , irreversibly , America 's war . <p> ' Ia Drang ... was a milestone , ' wrote William P. Bundy , then assistant secretary of state for East Asia , in an unpublished memoir for the State Department archives in 1972 . " It appeared to confirm the importance of ... search-and-destroy ... and that American forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became more vivid when on November 28 a large South Vietnamese unit was ambushed and cut to pieces in the Michelin plantation northwest of Saigon . ' <p> General Giap knew better . " After the Ia Drang battle we concluded that we could fight and win against the cavalry troops ... ' the legendary Giap told U.S. News ( see page 48 ) " We had a strategy of people 's war . You had tactics , and it takes very decisive tactics to win a strategic victory . You planned to use the cavalry tactics as your strategy to win the war . If we could defeat your tactics - your helicopters - then we could defeat your strategy . ' <p> Giap sent almost a million of his countrymen to their deaths , but time and the patience of the American people ran out long before North Vietnam ran out of soldiers . The victory in the Ia Drang Valley degenerated into a decade of bloody frustration that sent 58,000 Americans home in shiny aluminum Army-issue caskets , ruined one President , deeply scarred another and turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , to those willing to see . Defense Secretary McNamara and others were startled when Westmoreland told them that in addition to the 220,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam or on the way in late 1965 , he would need 200,000 more in 1966 and probably another 200,000 by early 1967 . <p> McNamara flew to Saigon November 28 for an after-action report on the Ia Drang . In a secret memo to Johnson , dated November 30 , he said Vietnam had reached a turning point : " We have but two options , it seems to me . One is <p> to go now for a compromise solution and hold further U.S. deployments to a minimum . The other is to stick with our stated objectives , and with the war , and provide what it takes in men and materiel . ' He added a somber and accurate forecast : " We should be aware that deployments of the kind I have recommended 600,000 by 1967 will not guarantee success . U.S. killed-in-action can be expected to reach 1,000 a month and the odds are even that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-decision ' at an even higher level . ' <p> Stanley Karnow , in his book Vietnam : A History , reports that at a secret White House conference in mid-December McNamara again pressed his point . " What you are saying is that no matter what we do militarily , there is no sure victory ? ' President Johnson asked . " That 's right , " said McNamara . <p> Bundy says McNamara 's alternative - freezing the U.S. buildup and negotiating a settlement - was never seriously considered . The other option - a major buildup in 1966 and stepped-up bombing of the North - " was readily accepted by the President , and ... came to be understood as the basis for all discussion . ' <p> McNamara 's pessimism continued to grow but , recalls Harry McPherson , White House counsel at the time : " McNamara was still providing the President with an enormous amount of detailed , optimistic information ... that this thing was working . ' Only at a farewell lunch in February , 1968 , says McPherson , did McNamara tearfully talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While McNamara kept his doubts to himself , the U.S. too often lost , covered up or ignored the lessons of the Ia Drang - that the North Vietnamese soldier was brave and tough , that it would cost more American lives than anyone believed to defeat him and that it would be impossible to crush the North Vietnamese Army so long as it could escape into Cambodia . The first lesson came before the battle was over , when a 400-man battalion was cut to pieces after it blundered into an ambush in a place called Landing Zone Albany . <p> The White House wanted a victory , not a lesson . " We were very concerned then that if we got some significant military demonstration , something that would consolidate the home front , that there was a feeling that this thing just might work - that we could go for the long haul , ' says Bundy . <p> Neither the military commanders in Vietnam nor the politicians in Washington were about to let a North Vietnamese ambush deprive them of the victory they needed . The morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer laid a memorandum on the President 's desk that said : " The press this morning is reporting heavy U.S. casualties as a result of a Communist ambush of a unit of the 1st Cavalry near Plei Me . The headquarters of the 1st Cavalry Division has sent in an official report stating this is erroneous . ' In Saigon and Pleiku , stone-faced briefers denied there had been an ambush . It was , they insisted , " a meeting engagement , " and although 155 Americans had been killed , casualties had been " moderate " and the Americans victorious . Of a hundred such victories and a thousand such lies , defeat was born . <p> After the " meeting engagement , " the North Vietnamese disappeared into Cambodia , and while Johnson was prepared to make Vietnam America 's war , he was not ready to let American soldiers pursue the enemy across an international boundary . " I suppose from a strictly military point of view , going into Cambodia would have been a net plus , ' says William Bundy . " But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to preserve a facade of Cambodian neutrality . ' <p> That facade eventually crumbled , and most of the other lessons of the Ia Drang had to be learned more than 550,000 times a year , every year . President Johnson refused to declare a state of emergency or to extend enlistments and call up the Reserves . Instead , he limited the Army tour of duty in Vietnam to 12 months ( 13 months for Marines ) , ensuring that the war would be fought by an endless stream of newcomers . The enlistments of many Ia Drang veterans expired within weeks ; the rest were gone within six months , and their training and experience went with them . <p> Broken back . The war was fed by a river of half-trained draftees and shake-and-bake lieutenants - many of them fine soldiers but all of them condemned to be dropped piecemeal into combat units with no institutional memory of what had gone before and no concern for what would come after . The backbone of the Army , the career sergeants , were ordered back to Vietnam again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit the Army in disgust . <p> ' It may be a terrible thing to say , but it might have been better in the long run if we had lost this first battle , as we did the first major battles of World War II and Korea , ' says military analyst Col. Harry G. Summers , Jr. , who was an infantry company commander in Vietnam . " Those first defeats made us understand that we were in danger of losing the war and that concentrated our efforts . ' <p> The Ia Drang made headlines only briefly while the decisions that shaped the war were made secretly in Washington and Hanoi . No TV cameras were on hand at Landing Zone X-Ray - only one young war correspondent with a 35-mm Nikon camera , two notebooks and an M-16 rifle . ( His account of the battle begins on page 36 . ) <p> In November of 1965 , few Americans were thinking very deeply about their country 's slow-motion drift into war . Only the faintest early warnings of a coming earthquake registered on social seismographs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ala. , Watts burned and , on October 15 , poet Allen Ginsberg led 10,000 protesters in an antiwar march in Berkeley . Republican Senator Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois said the sight was " enough to make any person loyal to this country weep . ' " Doctor Zhivago " and " The Sound of Music " packed the nation 's movie houses . London contributed the miniskirt , bell-bottom pants and the Beatles ' movie " Help ! " The kids rocked to " A Hard Day 's Night " while their elders hummed " It Was a Very Good Year . " America in 1965 was a lot closer , spiritually , to 1959 than it was to 1969 . Perhaps 1965 was a good year , but it was the last good one for a long time .
