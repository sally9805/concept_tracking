Soldiers of the G.A.R. stand alongside the tracks . They are General Dodge 's soldiers , keeping the tracks maintained for the Lincoln Train . If I stand right , the edges of my bonnet are like blinders and I ca n't see the soldiers at all . It is a spring evening . At the house the lilacs are blooming . My mother wears a sprig pinned to her dress under her cameo . I can smell it , even in the crush of these people all waiting for the train . I can smell the lilac , and the smell of too many people crowded together , and a faint taste of cinders on the air . I want to go home but that house is not ours anymore . I smooth my black dress . On the train platform we are all in mourning . <p> The train will take us to St. Louis , from whence we will leave for the Oklahoma territories . They say we will walk , but I do n't know how my mother will do that . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek my bag with our water and provisions . <p> " Julia Adelaide , " my mother says , " I think we should go home . " <p> " We 've come to catch the train , " I say , very sharp . <p> I 'm Clara , my sister Julia is eleven years older than me . Julia is married and living in Tennessee . My mother blinks and touches her sprig of lilac uncertainly . If I am not sharp with her , she will keep on it . <p> I wait . When I was younger I used to try to school my unruly self in Christian charity . God sends us nothing we can not bear . Now I only try to keep it from my face , try to keep my outer self disciplined . There is a feeling inside me , an anger , that I ca n't even speak . Something is being bent , like a bow , bending and bending and bending  --  <p> " When are we going home ? " my mother says . <p> " Soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wo n't remember and in a moment she 'll ask again . And again and again , through this long long train ride to St. Louis . I am trying to be a Christian daughter , and I remind myself that it is not her fault that the war turned her into an old woman , or that her mind is full of holes and everything new drains out . But it 's not my fault either . I do n't even try to curb my feelings and I know that they rise up to my face . The only way to be true is to be true from the inside and I am not . I am full of unchristian feelings . My mother 's infirmity is her trial , and it is also mine . <p> I wish I were someone else . <p> The train comes down the track , chuffing , coming slow . It is an old , badly used thing , but I can see that once it was a model of chaste and beautiful workmanship . Under the dust it is a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was built to be used by President Lincoln , but since the assassination attempt he is too infirm to travel . People begin to push to the edge of the platform , hauling their bags and worldly goods . I do n't know how I will get our valise on . If Zeke could have come I could have at least insured that it was loaded on , but the Negroes are free now and they are not to help . The notice said no family Negroes could come to the station , although I see their faces here and there through the crowd . <p> The train stops outside the station to take on water . <p> " Is it your father ? " my mother says diffidently . " Do you see him on the train ? " <p> " No , Mother , " I say . " We are taking the train . " <p> " Are we going to see your father ? " she asks . <p> It does n't matter what I say to her , she 'll forget it in a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not say that we will see my father even to give her a few moments of joy . <p> " Are we going to see your father ? " she asks again . <p> " No , " I say . <p> " Where are we going ? " <p> I have carefully explained it all to her and she cried , every time I did . People are pushing down the platform toward the train , and I am trying to decide if I should move my valise toward the front of the platform . Why are they in such a hurry to get on the train ? It is taking us all away . <p> " Where are we going ? Julia Adelaide , you will answer me this moment , " my mother says , her voice too full of quaver to quite sound like her own . <p> " I 'm Clara , " I say . " We 're going to St. Louis . " <p> " St. Louis , " she says . " We do n't need to go to St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I . . . I am quite indisposed . Let 's go back home now , this is foolish . " <p> We can not go back home . General Dodge has made it clear that if we did not show up at the train platform this morning and get our names checked off the list , he would arrest every man in town , and then he would shoot every tenth man . The town knows to believe him , General Dodge was put in charge of the trains into Washington , and he did the same thing then . He arrested men and held them and every time the train was fired upon he hanged a man . <p> There is a shout and I can only see the crowd moving like a wave , pouring off the edge of the platform . Everyone is afraid there will not be room . I grab the valise and I grab my mother 's arm and pull them both . The valise is so heavy that my fingers hurt , and the weight of our water and food is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I put her in bed at night she is all tiny like a child , but now she refuses to move , pulling against me and opening her mouth wide , her mouth pink inside and wet and open in a wail I can just barely hear over the shouting crowd . I do n't know if I should let go of the valise to pull her , or for a moment I think of letting go of her , letting someone else get her on the train and finding her later . <p> A man in the crowd shoves her hard from behind . His face is twisted in wrath . What is he so angry at ? My mother falls into me , and the crowd pushes us . I am trying to hold on to the valise , but my gloves are slippery , and I can only hold with my right hand , with my left I am trying to hold up my mother . The crowd is pushing all around us , trying to push us toward the edge of the platform . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting all around us . My mother is fallen against me , her face pressed against my bosom , turned up toward me . She is so frightened . Her face is pressed against me in improper intimacy , as if she were my child . My mother as my child . I am filled with revulsion and horror . The pressure against us begins to lessen . I still have a hold of the valise . We 'll be all right . Let the others push around , I 'll wait and get the valise on somehow . They wo n't leave us travel without anything . <p> My mother 's eyes close . Her wrinkled face looks up , the skin under her eyes making little pouches , as if it were a second blind eyelid . Everything is so grotesque . I am having a spell . I wish I could be somewhere where I could get away and close the windows . I have had these spells since they told us that my father was dead , where everything is full of horror and strangeness . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to tell them to give way , but I can not . People around us are crying out . I can not see anything but the people pushed against me . People are still pushing , but now they are not pushing toward the side of the platform but toward the front , where the train will be when we are allowed to board . <p> Wait , I call out but there 's no way for me to tell if I 've really called out or not . I ca n't hear anything until the train whistles . The train has moved ? They brought the train into the station ? I ca n't tell , not without letting go of my mother and the valise . My mother is being pulled down into this mass . I feel her sliding against me . Her eyes are closed . She is a huge doll , limp in my arms . She is not even trying to hold herself up . She has given up to this moment . <p> I ca n't hold on to my mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Oh merciful god . <p> I do not know how I will get through this moment . <p> The crowd around me is a thing that presses me and pushes me up , pulls me down . I can not breathe for the pressure . I see specks in front of my eyes , white sparks , too bright , like metal and like light . My feet are n't under me . I am buoyed by the crowd and my feet are behind me , I am unable to stand , unable to fall . I think my mother is against me , but I ca n't tell , and in this mass I do n't know how she can breathe . <p> I think I am going to die . <p> All the noise around me does not seem like noise anymore . It is something else , some element , like water or something , surrounding me and overpowering me . <p> It is like that for a long time , until finally I have my feet under me , and I 'm leaning against people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop myself . The platform is solid . My whole body feels bruised and roughly used . <p> My mother is not with me . My mother is a bundle of black on the ground , and I crawl to her . I wish I could say that as I crawl to her I feel concern for her condition , but at this moment I am no more than base animal nature and I crawl to her because she is mine and there is nothing else in the world I can identify as mine . Her skirt is tucked up so that her ankles and calves are showing . Her face is black . At first I think it something about her clothes , but it is her face , so full of blood that it is black . <p> People are still getting on the train , but there are people on the platform around us , left behind . And other things . A surprising number of shoes , all badly used . Wraps , too . Bags . Bundles and people . <p> I try raising her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her arms are thin , but they do n't go the way I want them to . I read in the newspaper that when President Lincoln was shot , he stopped breathing , and his personal physician started him breathing again . But maybe the newspaper was wrong , or maybe it is more complicated than I understand , or maybe it does n't always work . She does n't breathe . <p> I sit on the platform and try to think of what to do next . My head is empty of useful thoughts . Empty of prayers . <p> " Ma'am ? " <p> It 's a soldier of the G.A.R. <p> " Yes sir ? " I say . It is difficult to look up at him , to look up into the sun . <p> He hunkers down but does not touch her . At least he does n't touch her . " Do you have anyone staying behind ? " <p> Like cousins or something ? Someone who is not " recalcitrant " in their handling of their Negroes ? " Not in town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asks , in his northern way . <p> " Yes sir , " I say , " she did . She was a Methodist , and you should contact the preacher . The Reverend Robert Ewald , sir . " <p> " I 'll see to it , ma'am . Now you 'll have to get on the train . " <p> " And leave her ? " I say . <p> " Yes ma'am , the train will be leaving . I 'm sorry ma'am . " <p> " But I ca n't , " I say . <p> He takes my elbow and helps me stand . And I let him . <p> " We are not really recalcitrant , " I say . " Where were Zeke and Rachel supposed to go ? Were we supposed to throw them out ? " <p> He helps me climb onto the train . People stare at me as I get on , and I realize I must be all in disarray . I stand under all their gazes , trying to get my bonnet on straight and smoothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my eyes or hands . <p> There are no seats . Will I have to stand until St. Louis ? I grab a seat back to hold myself up . It is suddenly warm and everything is distant and I think I am about to faint . My stomach turns . I breathe through my mouth , not even sure that I am holding on to the seat back . <p> But I do n't fall , thank Jesus . <p> " It 's not Lincoln , " someone is saying a man 's voice , rich and baritone , and I fasten on the words as a lifeline , drawing myself back to the train car , to the world . " It 's Seward . Lincoln no longer has the capacity to govern . " <p> The train smells of bodies and warm sweaty wool . It is a smell that threatens to undo me , so I must concentrate on breathing through my mouth . I breathe in little pants , like a dog . The heat lies against my skin . It is airless . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that damned actor made him a saint when he shot him , " says a second voice , " And now no one dare oppose him . It does n't matter if his policies make sense or not . " <p> " You 're wrong , " says the first . " Seward is governing through him , Lincoln is an imbecile . He ca n't govern , look at the way he handled the war . " <p> The second snorts . " He won . " <p> " No , " says the first , " we lost , there is a difference , sir . We lost even though the ! north never could find a competent general . " I know the type of the first one . He 's the one who thinks he is brilliant , who always knew what President Davis should have done . If they are looking for a recalcitrant southerner , they have found one . <p> " Grant was competent . Just not brilliant . Any military man who is not Alexander t he Great is going to look inadequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a drinker , " the first one says . " It was his subordinates . They 'd been through years of war . They knew what to do . " <p> It is so hot on the train . I wonder how long until the train leaves . <p> I wonder if the Reverend will write my sister in Tennessee and tell her about our mother . I wish the train were going east toward Tennessee instead of north and west toward St. Louis . <p> My valise . All I have . It is on the platform . I turn and go to the door . It is closed and I try the handle , but it is too stiff for me . I look around for help . <p> " It 's locked , " says a woman in gray . She does n't look unkind . <p> " My things , I left them on the platform , " I say . <p> " Oh , honey , " she says , " they are n't going to let you back out there . They do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window but I ca n't see the valise . I can see some of the soldiers , so I beat on the window . One of them glances up at me , frowning , but then he ignores me . <p> The train blows that it is going to leave , and I beat harder on the glass . If I could shatter that glass . They do n't understand , they would help me if they understood . The train lurches and I stagger . It is out there , somewhere , on that platform . Clothes for my mother and me , blankets , things we will need . Things I will need . <p> The train pulls out of the station and I feel so terrible I sit down on the floor in all the dirt from people 's feet and sob . <p> The train creeps slowly at first , but then picks up speed . The clack-clack clack-clack rocks me . It is improper , but I allow it to rock me . I am in others ' hands now and there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . So it has been all my life . I have tried to be dutiful , but something in me has not bent right , and I have never been able to maintain a Christian frame of mind , but like a chicken in a yard , I have always kept my eyes on the small things . I have tended to what was in front of me , first the house , then my mother . When we could not get sugar , I learned to cook with molasses and honey . Now I sit and let my mind go empty and let the train rock me . <p> " Child , " someone says . " Child . " <p> The woman in gray has been trying to get my attention for awhile , but I have been sitting and letting myself be rocked . <p> " Child , " she says again , " would you like some water ? " <p> Yes , I realize , I would . She has a jar and she gives it to me to sip out of . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we lost it in the crush on the platform . " <p> " You have someone with you ? " she asks . <p> " My mother , " I say , and start crying again . " She is old , and there was such a press on the platform , and she fell and was trampled . " <p> " What 's your name , " the woman says . <p> " Clara Corbett , " I say . <p> " I 'm Elizabeth Loudon , " the woman says . " And you are welcome to travel with me . " There is something about her , a simple pleasantness , that makes me trust her . She is a small women , with a small nose and eyes as gray as her dress . She is younger than I first thought , maybe only in her thirties ? " How old are you ? Do you have family ? " she asks . <p> " I am seventeen . I have a sister , Julia . But she does n't live in Mississippi anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman asks . <p> " In Beech Bluff , near Jackson , Tennessee . " <p> She shakes her head . " I do n't know it . Is it good country ? " <p> " I think so , " I say . " In her letters it sounds like good country . But I have n't seen her for seven years . " Of course no one could travel during the war . She has three children in Tennessee . My sister is twenty-eight , almost as old as this woman . It is hard to imagine . <p> " Were you close ? " she asks . <p> I do n't know that we were close . But she is my sister . She is all I have , now . I hope that the Reverend will write her about my mother , but I do n't know that he knows where she is . I will have to write her . She will think I should have taken better care . <p> " Are you traveling alone ? " <p> " My companion is a few seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats together . " <p> Her companion is a man ? Not her husband , maybe her brother ? But she would say her brother if that 's who she meant . A woman traveling with a man . An adventuress , I think . There are stories of women traveling , hoping to find unattached girls like myself . They befriend the young girls and then deliver them to the brothels of New Orleans . <p> For a moment Elizabeth takes on a sinister cast . But this is a train full of recalcitrant southerners , there is no opportunity to kidnap anyone . Elizabeth is like me , a woman who has lost her home . <p> It takes the rest of the day and a night to get to St. Louis , and Elizabeth and I talk . It 's as if we talk in ciphers , instead of talking about home we talk about gardening , and I can see the garden at home , lazy with bees . She is a quilter . I do n't quilt , but I used to do petit pointe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been to get colors . And we talk about mending and making do , we have all been making do for so long . <p> When it gets dark , since I have no seat , I stay where I am sitting by the door of the train . I am so tired , but in the darkness all I can think of is my mother 's face in the crowd and her hopeless open mouth . I do n't want to think of my mother , but I am in a delirium of fatigue , surrounded by the dark and the rumble of the train and the distant murmur of voices . I sleep sitting by the door of the train , fitful and rocked . I have dreams like fever dreams . In my dream I am in a strange house , but it is supposed to be my own house , but nothing is where it should be , and I begin to believe that I have actually entered a stranger 's house , and that they 'll return and find me here . When I wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this strange house , looking through things . <p> I wake before dawn , only a little rested . My shoulders and hips and back all ache from the way I am leaning but I have no energy to get up . I have no energy to do anything but endure . Elizabeth nods , sometimes awake , sometimes asleep , but neither of us speak . <p> Finally the train slows . We come in through a town , but the town seems to go on and on . It must be St. Louis . We stop and sit . The sun comes up and heats the car like an oven . There is no movement of the air . There are so many buildings in St. Louis , and so many of them are tall , two stories , that I wonder if they cut off the wind and that is why it 's so still . But finally the train lurches and we crawl into the station . <p> I am one of the first off the train by virtue of my position near the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disembark , but he need not have bothered for there is a rush . I am borne ahead at its beginning but I can stop at the back of the platform . I am afraid that I have lost Elizabeth , but I see her in the crowd . She is on the arm of a younger man in a bowler . There is something about his air that marks him as different  --  he is sprightly and apparently fresh even after the long ride . <p> I almost let them pass , but the prospect of being alone makes me reach out and touch her shoulder . <p> " There you are , " she says . <p> We join a queue of people waiting to use a trench . The smell is appalling ammonia acrid and eye-watering . There is a wall to separate the men from the women , but the women are all together . I crouch , trying not to notice anyone and trying to keep my skirts out of the filth . It is so awful . It 's worse than anything . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? What would I do ? I think maybe it was better , maybe it was God 's hand . But that is an awful thought , too . <p> " Child , " Elizabeth says when I come out , " what 's the matter ? " <p> " It 's so awful , " I say . I should n't cry , but I just want to be home and clean . I want to go to bed and sleep . <p> She offers me a biscuit . <p> " You should save your food , " I say . <p> " Do n't worry , " Elizabeth says , " We have enough . " <p> I should n't accept it , but I am so hungry . And when I have a little to eat , I feel a little better . <p> I try to imagine what the fort will be like where we will be going . Will we have a place to sleep , or will it be barracks ? Or worse yet , tents ? Although after the night I spent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . I imagine if I have to stay awhile in a tent then I 'll make the best of it . <p> " I think this being in limbo is perhaps worse than anything we can expect at the end , " I say to Elizabeth . She smiles . <p> She introduces her companion , Michael . He is enough like her to be her brother , but I do n't think that they are . I am resolved not to ask , if they want to tell me they can . <p> We are standing together , not saying anything , when there is some commotion farther up the platform . It is a woman , her black dress is like smoke . She is running down the platform , coming toward us . There are all of these people and yet it is as if there is no obstacle for her . " NO NO NO NO , DO N'T TOUCH ME ! FILTHY HANDS ! DO N'T LET THEM TOUCH YOU ! DO N'T GET ON THE TRAINS ! " <p> People are getting out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her dress is so threadbare it is rotten and torn at the seams . Her skirt is greasy black and matted and stained . Her face is so thin . " ANIMALS ! THERE IS NOTHING OUT THERE ! PEOPLE DO N'T HAVE FOOD ! THERE IS NOTHING THERE BUT INDIANS ! THEY SENT US OUT TO SETTLE BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE ! " <p> I expect she will run past me but she grabs my arm and stops and looks into my face . She has light eyes , pale eyes in her dark face . She is mad . <p> " WE WERE ALL STARVING , SO WE WENT TO THE FORT BUT THE FORT HAD NOTHING . YOU WILL ALL STARVE , THE WAY THEY ARE STARVING THE INDIANS ! THEY WILL LET US ALL DIE ! THEY DO N'T CARE ! " She is screaming in my face , and her spittle sprays me , warm as her breath . Her hand is all tendons and twigs , but she 's so strong I ca n't escape . <p> The soldiers grab her and yank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holding it . I ca n't stand up . <p> Elizabeth pulls me upright . " Stay close to me , " she says and starts to walk the other way down the platform . People are looking up following the screaming woman . <p> She pulls me along with her . I keep thinking of the woman 's hand and wrist turned black with grime . I remember my mother 's face was black when she lay on the platform . Black like something rotted . <p> " Here , " Elizabeth says at an old door , painted green but now weathered . The door opens and we pass inside . <p> " What ? " I say . My eyes are accustomed to the morning brightness and I ca n't see . <p> " Her name is Clara , " Elizabeth says . " She has people in Tennessee . " <p> " Come with me , " says another woman . She sounds older . " Step this way . Where are her things ? " <p> I am being kidnapped . Oh merciful God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Her things were lost , her mother was killed in a crush on the platform . " <p> The woman in the dark clucks sympathetically . " Poor dear . Does Michael have his passenger yet ? " <p> " In a moment , " Elizabeth says . " We were lucky for the commotion . " <p> I am beginning to be able to see . It is a storage room , full of abandoned things . The woman holding my arm is older . There are some broken chairs and a stool . She sits me in the chair . Is Elizabeth some kind of adventuress ? <p> " Who are you ? " I ask . <p> " We are friends , " Elizabeth says . " We will help you get to your sister . " <p> I don:t believe them . I will end up in New Orleans . Elizabeth is some kind of adventuress . <p> After a moment the door opens and this time it is Michael with a young man . " This is Andrew , " he says . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That is what stops me from saying , " Run ! " Andrew is blinded by the change in light , and I can see the astonishment working on his face , the way it must be working on mine . " What is this ? " he asks . <p> " You are with Friends , " Michael says , and maybe he has said it differently than Elizabeth , or maybe it is just that this time I have had the wit to hear it . <p> " Quakers " Andrew says . " Abolitionists ? " <p> Michael smiles , I can see his teeth white in the darkness . " Just Friends , " he says . <p> Abolitionists . Crazy people who steal slaves to set them free . Have they come to kidnap us ? We are recalcitrant southerners , I have never heard of Quakers seeking revenge , but everyone knows the Abolitionists are crazy and they are liable to do anything . <p> " We 'll have to wait here until they begin to move people out , it will be evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I am so frightened , I just want to be home . Maybe I should try to break free and run out to the platform , there are northern soldiers out there . Would they protect me ? And then what , go to a fort in Oklahoma ? <p> The older woman asks Michael how they could get past the guards so early and he tells her about the madwoman . A " refugee " he calls her . <p> " They 'll just take her back , " Elizabeth says , sighing . <p> Take her back , do they mean that she really came from Oklahoma ? They talk about how bad it will be this winter . Michael says there are Wisconsin Indians re-settled down there , but they 've got no food , and they 've been starving on government handouts for a couple of years . Now there will be more people . They 're not prepared for winter . <p> There ca n't have been much handout during the war .

And so we will be passed hand to hand , like a bucket in a brigade , until we get to our families . <p> They call it the underground railroad . <p> But we are slave owners . <p> " Wrong is wrong , " says Elizabeth . " Some of us ca n't stand and watch people starve . " <p> " But only two out of the whole train , " Andrew says . <p> Michael sighs . <p> The old woman nods . " It is n't right . " <p> Elizabeth picked me because my mother died . If my mother had not died , I would be out there , on my way to starve with the rest of them . <p> I ca n't help it but I start to cry . I should not profit from my mother 's death . I should have kept her safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hush , you 'll be okay . " <p> " It 's not right , " I whisper . I 'm trying not to be loud , we must n't be discovered . <p> " What , child ? " <p> " You should n't have picked me , " I say . But I am crying so hard I do n't think they can understand me . Elizabeth strokes my hair and wipes my face . It may be the last time someone will do these things for me . My sister has three children of her own , and she wo n't need another child . I 'll have to work hard to make up my keep . <p> There are blankets there and we lie down on the hard floor , all except Michael , who sits in a chair and sleeps . I sleep this time with fewer dreams .

" I ask Elizabeth . <p> The stars are a banner behind her quiet head . " We will save what we can , " she says . <p> It is n't fair that I was picked . " I want to help , " I tell her . <p> She is silent for a moment . " We only work with our own , " she says . There is something in her voice that has not been there before . A sharpness . <p> " What do you mean ? " I ask . <p> " There are no slavers in our ranks , " she says and her voice is cold . <p> I feel as if I have had a fever ; tired , but clear of mind .
