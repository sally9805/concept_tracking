<p> Powell as president ? No , but maybe as vice president <p> Colin Powell is charming , patriotic , politically astute and a leader . But he is not a Republican . <p> With the campaign for his best-selling book well under way , the general has been giving interviews . His positions on such issues as abortion , school prayer and affirmative action hardly meet standards set by winning Republican candidates in 1994 . In fact , he considers the " Contract With America " a little too hard , too harsh , too unkind . <p> It will be tempting for the GOP to nominate Powell , since the current polls say he has the best chance of defeating President Clinton . However , a Republican president who apparently distrusts the vigorous new conservative movement could do serious long-term damage to the party that had elected him . <p> I cast my first vote for Dwight David Eisenhower , another charmer . Ike was widely popular , but he had no stomach for the conservative Republican principles of the era . His 1952 victory led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1958 , the GOP lost 68 House and 14 Senate seats . The leader in the White House was really not a Republican . <p> Colin Powell for vice president . I like the ring of it . <p> ROBERT FEENEY <p> Louisville <p> I am writing in response to " Would Powell be a ' black ' candidate ? " by Kevin Merida in the Sept. 19 Denver Post . <p> Merida , in referring to work done by Frank Luntz , said that " Even white voters who signal racial hostility on questions about affirmative action and immigration lose that animus when it comes to Powell . " <p> I , and many of my friends , greatly resent the implication that any antipathy toward affirmative action or immigration is based on race . We are opposed to many aspects of these two subjects for economic and moral reasons that have nothing to do with race . <p> MICHAEL BROUILLETTE <p> Littleton <p> With reference to Chuck Green 's column and Dick Lamm 's commentary in the Sept. 20 edition of The Post , I agreed about 99 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is beyond me how Colin Powell could associate himself with Jesse Helms , Pat Robertson , Phil Gramm , Newt Gingrich , Dick Armey , Alfonse D'Amato , Joel Hefley , etc . <p> I love everything I read and hear about Powell , but I have a problem . The military is a sorry training ground for the political arena . The only president with a military background who was much of a success was George Washington , and he was a citizen soldier . Grant was a mess . Ike was a nice guy , but not much at running a civilian operation . <p> WILLIAM R. BIXLER <p> Englewood <p> Administrative inefficiency is the enemy <p> In the current rhetoric about Medicare , Social Security and welfare reform , two critically important aspects seem never to be addressed . We seem never to hear concerns about the massive and expensive administrative inefficiency that plagues these programs . And we never hear our leaders speak with commitment about the long-term view of working on prevention . The public needs to insist that these aspects be addressed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Medicare , Social Security and Worker 's Compensation programs . In every instance , serious and extensive efficiency problems were apparent . For example , when a client of mine made an inquiry about her Social Security disability case she was told it would take some time to find her file since 7,000 files were piled on the floor with no place to organize them - and that it was like this in most Social Security offices . It 's a puzzle to me how we can have the technological sophistication to communicate via computers , but we ca n't get ( or just have n't ) the administration of our social programs into efficient , workable order . I suspect it 's a reflection of our sadly sick values . <p> In reference to the long-term view of social programs , my clinical experience as a therapist has shown me that patterns learned early in life hang around and are repeated throughout life . Rather than working on changing people once patterns are in place , which at best is a slow and expensive process , maybe we ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better parents , especially from the beginning of pregnancy through the preschool years , is where it 's at . Then everybody wins ; I think that 's obvious . <p> We need to invest in our children , and we need to insist on efficiency from our governments . It 's our money and our world . Let your legislators know that you expect these things of them - and then ask them how you can help get the job done . <p> AUDREY BRODT , Ph.D . <p> Denver <p> Just where have these women ' arrived ' ? <p> Cathy Walsh 's Sept. 20 letter to the editor , headlined " Two tales of women , " was right on the mark as far as it went . I , too , was very disappointed to read of the trend-setting successful Colorado business women who are eager to fork out $ 95 to attend a cigar " smoker " in order to " keep up " with men . <p> It would appear that engaging in unhealthy traditionally male habits , i.e. , smoking cigars and drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived . Arrived where - at the hospital admissions door ? There is already irrefutable evidence of increasing coronary heart disease , hypertension , strokes , cancers , etc. in women as they have taken on the " addictions " of the workplace - workaholism , higher-stress responsibilities and competition for top positions . <p> I have long been an advocate for the empowerment and equality of women in all areas of our society , believing that such gains provide the opportunity to propose and implement a more life-sustaining and growth- oriented social , economic and political model . While I celebrate the professional and economic successes of women , I feel that their emulation of the male pseudo-power model ( tough , hard-drinking , stogie-smoking " high roller " ) diminishes their real power as community leaders . <p> PATRICIA GOUBEAUX <p> Carbondale <p> Best choice for Statuary Hall : Ralph Carr <p> Interest is being created to fill the only remaining place for a statue of a notable person from Colorado to accompany Dr. Florence Sabin in Statuary Hall in Washington . <p> That person , I believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at great personal sacrifice vigorously opposed the creation of concentration camps for American citizens , in this case those of Japanese ancestry . He declared rightly that the equality and inviolability of American citizenry were being breached unfairly . <p> Time and costly retributions have proven him correct and are evidence of his innate wisdom courageously espoused for all Americans . Carr is the most eminent candidate for the last place in Statuary Hall . <p> FREDERIC M. PANNEBAKER <p> Denver <p> CU School of Law is not a racist place <p> As a law professor of color who has taught at CU Law School for six years and before that taught at several other schools , including UCLA , Wisconsin and the University of Washington , I would like to comment on your story , " Regent alleges racism at CU School of Law , " ( Friday , Sept. 15 ) . <p> As a civil rights scholar - and thus someone who is attuned to issues of race - I do not find the law school to be the racist place that Regent Norwood Robb believes it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accreditation report . <p> The CU School of Law has supported my research and teaching . I have four additional faculty colleagues of color in a faculty of 32 , which is a proportion considerably larger than that of virtually all U.S. law schools . Twenty-one percent of the student body consists of minority students , also well above the U.S. average . <p> There are areas at the university , as well as in the state , where racism is a serious problem , where institutional neglect and individual malice do make life hard for people of color . But the law school is certainly near the bottom of that list , not the top . <p> RICHARD DELGADO <p> Charles Inglis Thomson Professor of Law <p> University of Colorado <p> Boulder <p> Walk or ride with us , <p> wheelchair user asks <p> I am one of the many wheelchair people embarrassed by government edicts that become unreasonable and costly to others . Yet I also know that society often does n't do good-common sense things unless it 's forced to , and so we must make up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express my gratitude to Fiddler 's Green for its special courtesy to the wheelchair brigade . To sit at the second-level railing is perfect as folks in front of us jump for joy . What a treasure it is to be attending a concert again . <p> Now let 's make those giant and hot drinks available to muscle- or nerve-damaged arms . <p> Container covers with a straw are not always available , so we must call on others to prevent a scalding or a spill . <p> Walk or ride with us for one day , and just maybe <p> ANGELA ROMAN <p> Golden
