Cabot , a charming village of 1,000 in the heart of northern Vermont 's dairy country , is known for its world-famous cheese , not its gay activists . That 's one reason why Palmer Legare is so unusual . Earlier this year , he founded Cabot 's first and only lesbian and gay group and circulated a petition supporting gay rights . Two weeks ago , he discussed gay issues with the state 's Governor , Democrat Howard Dean . The other unusual thing about Legare is that he 's just 17 , and his group meets at Cabot High School . <P> Gina De Vries is only 14 and lives a continent away from Legare , in San Francisco , but perhaps not quite a world apart . Having come out to her parents and schoolmates at age 12 , she now calls herself " a queer youth activist "  --  an identification she uses effortlessly , as though she were saying " ninth grader " or " aspiring poet , " other terms that describe her . Articulate beyond her years , De Vries ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an advisory committee of the city 's Human Rights Commission . She is , by more than a decade , the committee 's youngest member . Jarringly precocious , she scheduled an interview with TIME for a Saturday morning , sparing enough time to attend a " transgender film festival " later that day . <P> For a country that had a hard time with the coming-out of a 39-year-old TV actress earlier this year , the whole notion of the boy next door eyeing the boy next door  --  and talking about it  --  is startling . The emergence of gay youth like Legare and De Vries is sparking the newest battles in the decades-old brawl over gay rights , which at the local level is more focused than ever on schools . Groups like Legare 's have formed in schools ( mostly public ones ) in 25 states , according to the Gay-Lesbian-Straight Education Network , an advocacy group based in New York City . The organization at one time primarily helped homosexual teachers ; these days it employs a 19-year-old to coordinate the student groups , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Executive director Kevin Jennings says just two such alliances existed in 1991 , when he founded the network ; now there are more than 100 . <P> More broadly , according to Columbia University researcher Joyce Hunter , 3% to 10% of U.S. teens now tell pollsters they are gay , lesbian , bisexual or " questioning " their orientation ; in the San Francisco Bay Area , the figure is 18% , according to one recent study . While reliable historical statistics do n't exist , Hunter says few teens came out when she began examining gay youth in the early ' 70s . " The change has been enormous , " she says . Lonely gay kids can find solace in two Webzines , dozens of online chat rooms and some 500 community support groups , usually run by social workers not affiliated with local schools .
