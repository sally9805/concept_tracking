<p> As is the case each NFL off-season , coaching jobs open and selected candidates emerge . Back when Herman Edwards was a Philadelphia Eagles cornerback , back before the NFL ever hired its first black head coach , he would hear the same names surface . <p> Top coordinators . Top position coaches . Top college coaches . And Jimmy Raye . <p> ' At that point , you felt he was a heck of a coach , ' said Edwards , who played cornerback for the Eagles against some of Raye 's teams from 1977-85 . ' You knew all about him . ' <p> Who did n't ? Raye quarterbacked a terrific Michigan State team from 1965-67 , starting ' The Battle of the Century ' game in ' 66 against Notre Dame that ended in a 10-10 tie . He went on to become an assistant coach at the University of Wyoming before moving on to become Eric Dickerson 's position coach with the Rams the year he set the NFL record with 2,105 rushing yards . <p> Each year , Raye 's credentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected candidates emerged . Quite often , Raye 's name was near the top of the list . Within Raye 's home as well as others ' , there was hope that he would one day beat the odds , the system and the other candidates to become one of the NFL 's few black head coaches . <p> Hope is dwindling . For the past eight years , Raye has served as an assistant coach in Kansas City , the last two as the Chiefs ' offensive coordinator . No one has hired him as a head coach yet , though he frequently is mentioned as a candidate . <p> ' His name was coming up when I was a player , ' said Edwards , now the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ' assistant head coach/defensive backs and one of the NFL 's top black head coaching prospects . ' His name is still coming up , but it 's not at the front of the pack anymore . Some of the young guys have come out . ' <p> Edwards , 45 , paused and said : ' Now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your window of an opportunity ? When does it close on you ? And if you do n't seize it within that time , will you ever get it again ? " <p> or the fortunate few , the window has opened some . It has opened wider than it was back in the mid-1980s , when Raye 's name surfaced but never appeared on the front door of any head coaching office . It has opened wider than it was on Oct. 3 , 1989 , when Art Shell replaced Mike Shanahan to become the first black head coach of the Los Angeles Raiders and the first black coach in NFL history . <p> It has opened wide enough so that when the Broncos square off against the Buccaneers today ( 11 a.m. , KCNC-4 ) , Tampa 's Bay top two top-ranking coaches , Tony Dungy and Edwards , both are black . <p> Much farther north , in Green Bay , Wis. , a game will be played today in which five of the six top-ranking coaches involved are black : Minnesota head coach Dennis Green and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray Rhodes and his offensive coordinator , Sherman Lewis , and Packers defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas . <p> It will mark the first time in the NFL 's 80-year existence that so many top-ranking black coaches will be involved in one game . <p> ' It 's clearly progress , ' Green said . ' It 's all about what I 've felt since I started coaching 20 years ago . You just want to be given equal opportunity to advance in your career . ' <p> After some frustrations , Dungy , Green and Rhodes have gotten it . And they have capitalized . In nine of the past 14 seasons , they have taken their teams to the playoffs . Dungy has turned around a moribund Tampa Bay franchise to the point where it now has the NFC 's best defense . Green has taken the Vikings on six playoff trips during his seven seasons in Minnesota . And before his four-year stint in Philadelphia ended after last season , Rhodes took two of his four teams to the playoffs . <p> ' We 've been to the playoffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very difficult to go to the playoffs , ' said Green , who will square off against Rhodes today and Dungy next week . ' A lot of guys in this league have not been in the playoffs . A lot of guys get their shot and do n't make it to the playoffs . So I think the guys have done pretty well . ' <p> But not enough have had the chance . In a predominantly black league , where approximately 67 percent of the players are black , only 9.6 percent of the NFL 's head coaches are black . In fact , the NFL 's only three black head coaches all work in the NFC Central . It is not a lot , the NFL 's number of black head coaches . But at least it is significantly higher than the NCAA 's . <p> Out of 114 Division I-A schools , there are only five black head coaches . College players might turn pro , but their coaches rarely do . <p> ' There are a lot of great coaches out there , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , ' said Broncos defensive assistant Terry Tumey , who joined Denver this season after spending the past four years coaching UCLA 's defensive line . ' There 's still to me somewhat of a barrier with guys not being able to be proactive and going out to talk to athletic directors about being hired as head coaches in college . <p> ' Are there qualified applicants ? Sure . Does that mean there are not the same barriers for people of other races ? No , there are barriers there as well . But for some reason , and I 'm not sure why , black coaches have n't bridged that gap . ' <p> Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis , whose name is mentioned today the way Raye 's was in the mid-1980s , thinks he knows why . He coached at Idaho State from 1981-84 , Long Beach State from ' 85-86 and New Mexico from ' 87-89 . He saw how colleges operated first-hand . <p> ' I think colleges have hired black coaches for recruiting , not coaching , ' said Lewis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young defenses . ' That has become a hindrance . When a coordinator leaves , the coach who recruited the player is not given his due . He has not been trained to advance to the next level . A coach needs a niche - the zone blitz , the West Coast offense , something - to be promoted . Recruiting is not it . Because if you do n't have a niche , people do n't have interest in you . ' <p> After watching the windows of the college world , and the windows of the NFL world , Tumey believes the NFL has taken bigger steps , even if they are baby steps , to address the issue . Just last season , the NFL produced about 20 videotaped resumes of assistant coaches primed to become head coaches . Many of the candidates are black . <p> ' The NFL has done a better job in the fact they try to address the issue , ' Tumey said . ' The NCAA does n't really delve into that aspect that much . It 's not a focal point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . It 's coming . It 's just slow to come . But with the NFL , it 's a conglomerate of people , so they try to do it , so I do think there 's been progress . <p> ' But I 'm kind of an optimist anyway . Twenty years ago , you would n't see this many black assistant coaches . So are they steps small ? Maybe . Are they small steps ? Maybe . But is progress being made ? Definitely . ' <p> fter this season , there is expected to be a sweeping amount of change in the coaching ranks . Washington 's Norv Turner , despite his solid start , is on tenuous ground . As is Cincinnati 's Bruce Coslet , St. Louis ' Dick Vermeil , and Tennessee 's Jeff Fisher , and perhaps another half-dozen coaches . <p> Coaching jobs will open . Selected candidates will emerge . This time there is no way around it . Some of the assistants simply have been too impressive to ignore . <p> Baltimore 's Lewis has learned the zone blitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas draws respect that most coaches in the league do not have . Shell , like Shanahan , is more seasoned from his one experience as a Raiders head coach . Edwards has trained under Dungy , the man who had the patience of Job . <p> Then there are the college coaches : Oklahoma State 's Bob Simmons , Stanford 's Tyrone Willingham , Howard 's Steve Wilson , New Mexico State 's Tony Samuel . Candidates abound . It 's just that the windows of the world need to be opened just a bit more than they have been when Raye was trying to climb through his window of opportunity . <p> ' The whole key is to get guys interviewed , ' said Edwards , who was beat out for the Kansas City head coaching job last winter by Gunther Cunningham . ' I do n't think until a guy gets an interview and gets to sit in there and go through the process , which I was able to do , that he is as prepared . <p> ' It 's like a marriage . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy for at least two or three years . You 've got to be comfortable hiring him and feel he 's really the leader of your football team . All you want is an opportunity . You want an opportunity to sit down and say what you have to say and to list how you would run a football team
