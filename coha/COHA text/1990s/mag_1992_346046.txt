A TYPICAL WORKING COUPLE MAKING $53,000 PAID ABOUT 28% of its 1991 income in total federal taxes . Mr. and Mrs. George Bush , who reported a total income of $1,329,580 , paid only 16% . The First Family did nothing illegal : their tax bite was similar to that of the other 62,000 U.S. households with annual incomes of more than $1 million . One big reason for this disparity is that Social Security payroll taxes exempted income above $53,400 . Social Security taxes doubled in the past decade , even as the top rate of income tax was cut sharply . As a result , almost three-fourths of taxpayers now pay more in Social Security levies than in federal income tax . A large majority of Americans pay more in total federal taxes than they did in 1980 , although the richest 10% pay less . <P> In the Bushes ' case , the tax bite was further reduced this year by the fact that they contributed to charity all the after-tax proceeds of the book that the First Lady penned in the name of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bushes had kept those royalties and not taken a charitable deduction , their tax bite would probably have been higher . But even in 1990 , when their reported total income was $452,803 , the Bushes paid only 23% of their earnings in federal taxes because of the cap on Social Security contributions and various investment deductions . Even as he has worked to cut the capital-gains tax on investment income , Bush has opposed bipartisan efforts to cut the Social Security tax , declaring that such a move would require " increased taxes around the corner "  --  meaning increased income taxes on wealthy people like himself . <P> Meanwhile , the President 's federalist philosophy has pushed responsibility for many government services down to states and cities , whose taxes consume 10% of the typical family 's income . Yet the Bush family escaped those taxes almost entirely . Because the President is a federal official , the Bushes are exempted from taxes in the District of Columbia , which would have cost them about $58,000 . They declare their voting residence in Texas , which collects no income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent only three days in the state last year . Had the First Family paid state income tax in Maine , where they own an oceanfront mansion and spent 40 days in 1991 , they would have been out $59,000 more .
