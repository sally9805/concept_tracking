How has Dave 's Gran Criterium changed since the movie ? By Garrett Lai // We lined up a pair of Masi Gran Criteriums-a similar-to-the-movie 1979 model and its counterpart for ' 99-to find out what two decades have done for this movie-star road bike . Ironically , Dave Stohler 's beloved Masi was Italian in name only . Faliero Masi established a framebuilding business in Southern California in ' 74 , and that 's where the movie bike was built . In contrast , the ' 99 Gran Criterium is a true Italian  --  made rig-Gran Criterium production returned to Italy in ' 88 . Riding the ' 79 is like taking a spin in a time machine : Non-indexed shifting , single-pivot brakes and a frugal dozen speeds . The ' 99 Gran Criterium 's Chorus shifting , activated by so-handy combined brake/shift levers , is as quick and sure as flipping channels with a TV remote . The 53x 12-tooth high gear would have made it a lot easier for Stohler to draft that Cinzano truck at 60 mph , compared to the ' 79 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brakes . Single-pivot sidepull calipers were state-of-the-art in ' 79 . Squeezing the levers takes more effort than the easy one-finger stops you get from today 's double-pivot calipers . A long descent can be a white-knuckler on the ' 79 if you do n't have strong hands . Both bikes handle similarly . Tilt the ' 79 into a turn and it tracks and corners like a greyhound rounding the last bend . Same for the ' 99-it 's rock  --  steady , eerily similar to the ' 79 , and a fine example of the Italian framebuilder 's art . Yet the bikes feature markedly different steering geometry . Both forks have a 1.5-cm rake , but the ' 79 Masi has a 73-degree head tube angle versus a steeper 75 degrees on the ' 99 . Still , the most startling contrast between eras comes in ride quality The ' 79 floats over small bumps and smooths pebbly asphalt as if the bike is barely touching the ground . On the other hand , the ' 99 lets you know you 're on a rough road , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner , you do n't notice a difference from bike to bike , but for comfort going down the road , the ' 79 is the clear-cut winner with its Cadillac ride . Another surprise : The ' 79 Masi is lighter-21.2 pounds versus 22 pounds for the ' 99 . The ' 79 's sew  --  up wheels and minimalist down tube shifters account for much of this difference . Of course , pricing has changed a lot since ' 79 . Back then , a complete bike would 've cost you $800-$1,000 with only a third of that amount going toward the components . Today component pricing far outstrips frame prices . The ' 99 Gran Criterium will set you back $1,600 for frame and fork , with the Chorus group costing an additional $1,200 and those Vento wheels another $600-for a total of $3,400 . ( Estimated value for a ' 79 is $500-$1,200 ) . Sure , bikes have changed since ' 79 . But as Breaking Away proves , cycling , with its private joys , thrills and speed , has not .
