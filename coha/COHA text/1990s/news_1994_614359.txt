<p> Dressed like a gladiator in shinguards , steel mask and chest protector , Chad Almy crouches at home plate , expecting a throw from left field and a chance to tag out the runner streaking in from third . The ball never makes it , but the runner does , sliding into the 12-year-old catcher at full speed and breaking his left leg . <p> An accident ? Of course . But researchers say such injuries are hardly rare these days , and that - partly due to the maniacally competitive nature common in aging baby boomers - they are almost certainly rising . <p> Up to 8 percent of the 5 million boys and girls who play the great American pastime get hurt during a season , according to a recent study by the American Academy of Pediatrics . What 's more , it said , being struck by a ball is the leading cause of eye injuries among kids 5 to 14 . On average , baseball kills about three kids a year . Justin McQuillen , 9 , of Hershey , Pa. , died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With so many kids in so many parks in so many cities , it 's impossible to track all injuries . But scholars believe that boomer angst about the future - which they agree is well-justified - combined with pressures put on kids from TV , teachers and peers , will push the injury toll ever higher . And the mental toll , too , which is why more kids than ever are seeing psychiatrists . <p> What 's happening ? <p> It 's not the nature of sports as much as human nature that 's to blame , according to scientists and trend watchers , who see youth sports as merely one gauge of the increasing competitiveness of society and the growing pressure that boomers are putting on their kids as a result . <p> But ascribing fault to parents would be as off base as blaming the kid who slid into Chad during a game in east Cobb a week ago . Both boys were simply playing by the rules , says Dr. Martha Ewing of Michigan State University 's Youth Sports Institute , who just completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports . <p> For boomers , she found , " winning is particularly important , and we want our kids to be as successful or more successful than we are . " <p> Giving kids competitive edge <p> Millions of aging boomers - mainly those 32 and older - have seen society 's rules , especially in business , change radically and ruthlessly . They 're reacting , experts say , by becoming increasingly worried , even paranoid , that their kids ' world will be even more cutthroat . Which is why many parents will drive extra miles and spend non-extra dollars to give their kids a leg up . <p> Among Ewing 's conclusions , based on interviews with 400 parents of child athletes : <p> Fathers more than mothers want their kids to participate " to be popular , " seeing popularity as a prerequisite for success . <p> Mothers more than fathers want their kids to " feel important , " which they believe will make their offspring try harder to sustain a positive self-image . <p> Both cite " the challenge of competition , " stressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show they can climb up and get better . " <p> Kids say they play to have fun , but parents " put much greater emphasis on com petition , recognition and success . " <p> There are 80 million baby boomers , born between 1946 and 1964 , with 66 million children . But it 's those who reached maturity about the time of the Kennedy assassination who are most competitive and putting the most pressure on kids , says Gerald Celente of the Trends Research Institute in Rhinebeck , N.Y . <p> " No one knows whether making our kids as competitive as we are will backfire , causing stress , burnout , dropout , " Celente says . " We keep sending signals we expect more , more and more . " <p> In search of that competitive edge , he says , boomers are enrolling their kids in everything from sports to glee clubs , giving them violin lessons , batting lessons , tutors , even getting some to take College Board exams for practice as early as age 13 . <p> Metaphor for success <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as shelling out $ 116 for a baseball glove , that makes kids feel they owe their parents something , says Dr. Richard Winer , an Atlanta psychiatrist . <p> " You figure you 're giving them the best money can buy , but there is that subtle implication that there should be results , " he says . " We are willing to help our kids in any way possible . But kids cry more these days . " <p> Emory University anthropologist Bradd Shore , who has lectured on the culture of baseball from Vienna to Somoa , says in a new book that the sport , more than any other , has become a metaphor for success in the United States , which is why parents will wait all night to sign their kids up to play . <p> His book , " Culture in Mind , " to be published by Oxford University Press , devotes several chapters to baseball , explaining that Americans see the game in religious terms , as a springtime renewal , a way of beating death . Its importance even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base " are n't always thinking of baseball . <p> That 's a pretty heady explanation for why 94,000 boys and girls in the 10-county metro area , and 250,000 in Georgia , play baseball and softball . But experts agree that the exploding interest in the sport is directly related to its innate significance to boomers . <p> " Parents think , ' If my kid does n't play baseball , be in the school play , she 's not going to have a future , ' " says Andrea Saveri of the Institute for the Future think tank in Menlo Park , Calif . " Many of the ideas boomers had are crumbling as jobs restructure . The likelihood is , this gets translated to their kids . " <p> For the next decade , she says , boomer angst will keep rising , and trickling down to kids , due to soaring health care costs , the " myth " that hard work means job security and " the realization that many of our goals may not ever be achieved . " <p> Statistics suggest that low-and high-skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . <p> In 1970 , only 52.3 percent of America 's high schoolers graduated . Now 80 percent do . <p> About 21 percent of young people finish college now , up from 10.7 percent in 1970 . <p> The U.S. Labor Department says 30 percent of new jobs with above- average earnings created in the next decade will require at least a bachelor 's degree compared with only 10 percent for a high school diploma . <p> In short , parents of kids who are Chad 's age are right to do all they can to find that edge , Winer says . <p> Researchers cite other signs of rising pressure on kids : <p> There 's been " an explosion " in the diagnosis of problems unheard of a generation ago , such as attention deficit disorder . This means parents are looking harder for trouble signs in their campaign to help their kids compete , says Dr. Ann Abramowitz , head of Emory 's Center for Learning and Attention Deficit Disorders . <p> More youths are taking expensive classes aimed at helping them score higher on college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college of your choice . <p> Chad 's parents , Clyde and Kay Almy , say they 're trying to do what 's right , but point out - just as researchers do - that today 's youngsters run into pressure at every turn . <p> " Chad was picked for a math competition , one of four sixth-graders , and it consisted of a 45-minute test , " Clyde Almy says . " When it comes to math , the object is to teach skills , but they graded everything . Why do you always have to have a winner and loser ? I do n't know where to draw the line . You want them to succeed , but at the same time , to enjoy being a kid . It 's tougher than when we were coming along . " <p> Alfreda Williams , 37 , who has three sons , feels caught between trying to give them " all the advantages " and spoiling them or sending wrong signals . <p> " Everything is more competitive today , and I think they get it from TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing sports heroes get rich , " Williams says . <p> " I want them to have fun , to learn discipline , to learn how to compete later on . But it 's also important to learn to be gracious in losing . "
