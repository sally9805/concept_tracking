Three great presidential lies : I am not a crook . I will never lie to you . I did not have sexual relations with that woman . <P> All first person . All simple declarative sentences . All uttered knowing the statement was false . <P> That 's what a lie is . <P> In 1960 , when the Russians shot down Gary Powers ' U2 spy plane , it was the Secretary of State , not President Dwight D. Eisenhower , who claimed a weather-research plane had gone off course . " So intense was the desire to not have the President lie , " says presidential historian Michael Beschloss , " to not break the bond of trust with the American people , it was left to others . Eisenhower never spoke an untruth . " Of course , Ike was never the focus of an investigation by a grand jury , either . <P> The history of presidential lying is a brief one because the phenomenon came into its own only in the television age . The Kennedy-Nixon debates were the first time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dissemble : " I do not have Addison 's disease . " When J.F.K. boldly stated that , he knew it was a bald-faced lie . <P> Once upon a time , Presidents might have fudged the facts to a few Congressmen in smoke-filled rooms , but who was the wiser ? If voters heard the words second- or thirdhand , how could they judge them ? Now it 's impossible to fib in obscurity . Americans can already mouth the words when they see the incessant reruns of that finger-jabbing image : " I did not have sexual relations with that woman . " Sissela Bok , the high priestess of the scholars of lying , says the TV camera has made it far more dangerous for a President to prevaricate than it was 50 years ago . Now it 's the camera that does n't lie . <P> In some ways , lying in general has become a lot easier .

If you live in a condo in San Diego , you can pretend you were captain of your high school football team in Akron , Ohio . But for public figures , it 's precisely the opposite : TV and the mass media turn the whole country into one small town . <P> All politicians , says presidential scholar Kathleen Hall Jamieson , " tell the truth selectively . " Bill Clinton has been accused of telling the truth slowly . This is not the same thing as lying . It 's a sin of omission , not commission . It 's like the difference between lying as a legal issue and as a moral one . The definition of perjury is far narrower than what your grandfather would have considered a damned lie . The legal bar of truth is awfully low . Bill Clinton can be " legally accurate " and still be lying through his teeth . " Religion and law are fishing at the opposite ends of a continuum , " says Skip Masback , a former Washington litigator who is now a Congregational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , ' Just be technically accurate , ' for in the depths of the soul , dissembling just does n't cut it .
