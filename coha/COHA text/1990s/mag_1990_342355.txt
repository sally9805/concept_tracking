While the rest of the sporting world was distracted with sideshows  --  the World Series , the Douglas-Holyfield fight  --  the main event was being played out in utter silence at the Hudson Theater on Broadway , where the two best players in the world , Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov , were fighting it out for the championship of chess . ( After 12 games , the match is tied . ) <P> Now , mention chess and most people 's eyes glaze over . They think of two old geezers , one of whom has died but no one has noticed , in overstuffed armchairs at the Diogenes Club . Know how chess crowds do the wave ? guffawed a CBS newsreader . With their eyebrows . <P> Ho , ho . What the benighted do n't understand is that modern chess is played not just against an opponent but against a clock . It thus produces a heart- stopping equivalent of football 's two-minute drill . At Move 32 of Game 8 , for example , challenger Karpov , losing , was forced to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in a dazzling flurry that did n't just leave him winning ; it left the crowd stunned and silent . Except , that is , for one patron who , unnerved by Karpov 's preposterous escape , let out a loud , shocking laugh . <P> Moreover , the place to watch world-championship chess is not in the theater but five floors up , in the analysis room . There the action is frenzied . One TV monitor shows the players and the running time clocks . The other shows the latest board position . Scattered about are a score of the greatest players in the world , a couple of whom are standing at the front trying dozens of follow- on combinations on a large demonstration board . The result is a tumult of lightning analysis , inspired second-guessing , withering criticism , contemptuous asides , suggestions and refutations as the pros search for the best possible " lines " into the future . <P> During Game 8 , I found myself in a room with the U.S. chess champion ( Lev Alburt ) , four grand masters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like watching the World Series with five Hall of Famers parsing every pitch and Cy Young correcting them . On Karpov 's 23rd move the parsing got slightly crazy : If Kasparov does A then Karpov must do B. If Kasparov then tries C and Karpov answers with D , look out : E , F and G follow . But if Kasparov does Z , then . . . <P> Some of these lines were harmony , variations on the main theme of the game . Some were jazz riffs , freestyle and whimsical . Some were just fanciful trills , exotic and occasionally atonal . They all went up on the board fast and furious , as patzers  --  plodding amateurs  --  like me struggled to follow the logic . <P> Then Karpov did the unexpected : he advanced a pawn , unbalancing the position and not a few grand masters . Instantly all the heretofore examined lines , entire symphonies of hypothetical variation , vanished into the ether . " Unheard melodies , " murmured the yellow-tied patzer sitting near me . His tone was wry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
