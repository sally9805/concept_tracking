Section : watercolor PAGE TEACHER ACHIEVEMENT AWARD/WATERCOLOR <p> " My whole life is teaching . I do nothing else except walk my dogs , " says Betty Lou Schlemm , who has been chosen to receive an Achievement Award for her outstanding work teaching watercolor painting . Her statement is an exaggeration , of course , for she has obviously devoted a great deal of time to her own award-winning paintings and to her best-selling book , Painting With Light ( Watson-Guptill Publications ) . But Schlemm clearly is dedicated to teaching watercolor as well as to caring for her three dogs . <p> Since she began conducting classes from her home in Rockport , Massachusetts , twenty-four years ago , Schlemm 's workshops have grown so popular that she no longer needs to advertise for students  --  her classes are always oversubscribed . Artists of all levels of ability , including seasoned professionals , clamor for a place in her classes , expecting to work hard every day for one solid week from eight-thirty in the morning until six in the evening , with many students choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a heavy , but people like that , " says Schlemm . " I do n't pound on the students , but I do fill their heads with art history , theories about composition , and information about watercolor painting . My students really want to take a serious approach to their painting , and I help them do that . " <p> A typical Schlemm workshop begins on Sunday evening with a get-acquainted dinner party at her home . Bright and early Monday morning , she presents a one-hour painting demonstration during which she begins to enumerate what she believes to be the most important aspects of the painting process . " Every day is special , and , as artists , we have to consider what 's happening in nature and focus on the one thing our paintings will describe , " she explains . " I agree with Cezanne 's idea that after you stare at something for a while , your eyes will come to rest on the one important thing that should become the focus of your painting . <p> " Emil Carlsen advised artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture should look like when it 's finished , " Schlemm adds , continuing to summarize her first-day lecture . " I use Cezanne 's and Carlsen 's principles as ways of responding to what I actually find in nature on a particular day . I go out to look at the light , the values , and the colors of the landscape to discover what makes their relationship special at a given moment . I then paint those special qualities in the scene , concerning myself only with balancing each new color and value with what has already been applied to the watercolor paper . " <p> Once charged with these motivating ideas , Schlemm 's students spend time creating their own response to the day . At four in the afternoon , they bring their pictures to a critique session and discuss each other 's work as well as Schlemm 's comments . <p> While other teachers might end the day after the critique , Schlemm offers a forty-five-minute still-life painting demonstration in her own studio . If they wish to , students may then work on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of the workshop are filled with more demonstrations , slide lectures , painting activity , and critiques . <p> No matter what subjects she chooses for her demonstrations , Schlemm always begins by establishing a careful pencil drawing on the watercolor paper . " It 's very important to have a good drawing , " she admonishes . " But as soon as I start to paint , the color takes over . Every new stroke of color must be balanced against what 's already been painted , and I constantly evaluate the evolving composition . The light colors go on first , then the darks ; I use either a 1 " or a 1 1/2 " sabelline brush for most of this preliminary development . I later use a No. round sable brush . " <p> Schlemm 's palette is , as she says , " limited to the colors I absolutely need . I use the hue , value , and weight of the color to express myself . " At present , that palette includes lemon yellow , cadmium yellow deep , cadmium red light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue , cerulean blue , ultramarine blue , and phthalocyanine green . <p> Schlemm 's attitudes , ideas , and techniques have developed over the course of more than thirty years of painting . She credits her teachers Ed Whitney and John Pellow with pointing her in the right direction , but she says her collection of art books has given her the greatest amount of information about the process of making a picture . " I spent months looking at my art-history books last year while recovering from eye surgery , " she recalls . " I learned so much about composition by looking at those pictures , particularly the reproductions of paintings from the Baroque period . " <p> Schlemm owned an art gallery in Rockport for seventeen years but gave it up to devote more time to teaching and painting . She exhibits her oils and watercolors with the Guild of Boston Artists in Boston , Massachusetts ; the Rockport Art Association in Rockport , Massachusetts ; and The Gallery at Six Deering Street in Portland , Maine . She also exhibits her watercolors in juried shows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is a member and a Dolphin Fellow . <p> While caring for her dogs makes it difficult to travel , Schlemm has nevertheless found time to judge shows and conduct workshops for a number of organizations and state watercolor societies . Several years ago , she traveled to Australia at the invitation of the Victorian Artist 's Society and the Australian Watercolor Society . Schlemm was told that she was the first American artist to receive an invitation from these groups to lecture and demonstrate . <p> American Artist is pleased to have the opportunity to recognize this dedicated teacher who , for twenty-four years , has challenged her students while challenging herself . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : October Hunt , 1992 , watercolor , 22 x 30 .
