The other five found Gerald on the floor sometime in what they called the morning . It was n't really morning , only that the lights were back on , but it was the closest they 'd come to morning in months , maybe longer . The interval between Duane 's appearance and Gerald 's was the longest yet , and the minute they-roused by Alan 's shout of " Hey , look what I found ! " - saw the new guy sprawled there , they all had the feeling that whatever was about to happen would happen soon . <p> To Paul , a veterinarian who had the most medical knowledge of the group , fell the task of reviving the new member of their little community . " Looks drugged , like everybody else , " he said as , having found a pulse , he now thumbed back Gerald 's eyelids . " Let 's get him ambulatory . " <p> Assisted by Alan and Mike , who each propped the unconscious Gerald by the arms , they walked him around the big , empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the corner where they were forced to piss and shit , because there were no toilet facilities in the room . The room , which had no windows and which seemed to be ventilated only by two small ducts high up near the ceiling , had long since begun to reek of a noxious stench . The five of them , now six , generally avoided looking at that corner ; the feeble pretense that it was n't there was one of the things keeping them tolerably sane . <p> As had been the case with the others , Gerald began coming out of his drug-induced stupor as he continued to be walked around the room . His eyes rolled in his head and he muttered incoherent nonsense . If Gerald 's case ran true to form , Paul estimated that by the end of an hour of ambulation , Gerald would have shaken off the drug , as most of the others , with the exception of Rich and himself , had done . <p> Rich , who had been the first arrival , had awakened by himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days to come out of the trance , or coma , or whatever it was . It had been Rich who had inaugurated the practice of using the one corner as the bathroom , leaving the others little choice but to follow suit . <p> Paul , who had come next , though unable to move his limbs on his own , had asked Rich to help him walk around once he 'd regained his senses . He had lain in a state of complete physical paralysis for at least two days , conscious , though unable to so much as blink his eyes . Due to the telltale effects , he suspected the drug to be a neurotoxic alkaloid produced by a species of blowfish used by Haitian voodoo priests to mimic death so closely that its victims are often buried alive . Dug up at night , they are enslaved by the priests , often for years of hard labor . This had set Paul wondering if , to the outside world , all of them were considered dead men , and about what their ultimate fate might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald around , relieving each other at intervals , the day 's food delivery had arrived through the Judas hole set at the bottom of the door , close to the concrete floor . Since their wristwatches had been taken during their periods of drug-induced stupor , along with their money and all personal effects , they could not measure time with any exactness . Paul checked Gerald 's pulse and retinal response again and told them to put him in one of the chairs . A few old wooden chairs and filthy mattresses on the floor were the room 's only furnishings . <p> " Can you hear me ? " Paul asked Gerald , who gave out a groan and looked for a few seconds like he might throw up . " Hey , guy ! <p> Do you understand me ? " <p> " Yeah , " Gerald said after a few more unsuccessful attempts at communication . <p> " What 's your name ? " Paul asked . <p> " Gerald McCoy . " <p> " Gerald , you 've been drugged . We all have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another hour or so . You understand ? " <p> " Yeah , " he said weakly , nodding . <p> " Can you remember where you were or what you were doing before you were drugged ? " Paul asked . " This is important . " <p> " Eating , " Gerald said . " Eating pussy . " <p> " This is serious , Gerald , " somebody in the group put in . <p> " Fuck you , man , " Gerald said , slurring his words . " This guy asked me what I was doing and I told him . I was eating a hooker 's pussy . I picked up the hooker on the Piazza San Marco , where they stand . For thirty thousand lira her cunt was mine to suck on for the next hour . " Gerald 's eyes swam in their sockets . " Fuckin ' room 's spinning . " <p> " That 's the drug , " Paul told him . " So you were eating pussy . Okay . Why were you in the . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Piazza San Marco . That 's in Venice , which is in Italy , " Gerald said . " I was there . . . I was there to . . . hey , what the fuck is going on here ? Who the fuck are you ? " Gerald lurched to his feet , only to collapse to the floor again . <p> " Take it easy , guy , " Alan said , as he and Rich picked him up and put him back in the chair . " That shit fucks you up . Do n't try to move for awhile . " <p> " Yeah , okay . I 'm sorry . I just do n't . . . this is n't the hotel . . . what's. . . who the fuck are you ? " Gerald tottered to his feet again . Pushing Alan and Rich away he bolted for the heavy steel door set in the cinderblock wall . Tripping over his own legs , he fell against it , howling in pain . <p> Paul turned him over and checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face but otherwise seemed okay . " Gerald , listen carefully , " Paul said . " Like the rest of us , you 've been drugged , kidnapped , and brought here . We do n't know where this place is , why we 've been abducted or by whom . We do n't even know for sure how long we 've been here . That 's why we want to know as much about what you can remember as possible . It could help us figure things out . " <p> " Yeah , sure , " Gerald said and tried to stand . " Lemme lay on that couch over there . " <p> " What couch ? " Duane asked . <p> " The one over there , next to the window . " He waved one hand weakly in an attempt to point . <p> " There 's no couch or windows in here , guy , " Duane told him . <p> " Bullshit . I can see it , " Gerald said . " A big , white , kidskin leather couch with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're hallucinating , Gerald , " Paul said . " That 's why we 're asking these questions now . We 've all seen things in here . Angels , giant mice- " <p> " - Human- headed caterpillars , " Alan chimed in . <p> " Exactly , " Paul went on , though he shot Alan a brief , telling glance . " And our memories are n't right either . It 's like they 've been altered . " Paul did n't add that , at least in the cases of three of the six , there were some signs that operations on their brains had been performed , though he had n't noticed any signs of cranial scarring on Gerald . " So whatever you can tell us .... " <p> " Yeah , sure , " Gerald said . " Put me on the couch . I got ta lay down . " <p> " Put him on one of the mattresses , " Paul told Alan and Rich . Once Gerald was lying comfortably , Paul asked him to tell him about himself . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last date he could remember , why he was in Venice , and anything out of the ordinary that had happened on his trip . <p> " I 'm a car salesman , " Gerald said . " But you know what ? I fuckin ' hate cars . Maybe that 's because I deal with them every day . So I figured I 'd take my vacation in Venice because there are no cars . <p> He was pretty sure it was August 11th when he ate the hooker 's pussy , because his flight out of Marco Polo Airport was on the 12th . Otherwise , nothing out of the ordinary happened to him , except that once he tripped on a slice of pizza he felt somebody had deliberately left in the street to hurt passersby and almost broke his face . <p> " That any help ? " he asked . <p> " You sure it was August they got you , guy ? " Duane asked . <p> " Yeah , pretty sure . How come ? " <p> " Because I remember they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been here considerably more than a year , which I do n't think we have , or that you 're full of shit , or that your memory 's already messed up . " <p> " I 'm telling you what I remember , " Gerald said testily . " Take it or leave it . " <p> " He got a scar ? " Alan asked Paul . <p> Paul shook his head . <p> " Scar ? Whaddaya mean scar ? " Gerald demanded . <p> " Some of us have scars on their heads which might indicate that they 've been operated on . You do n't seem to have any scar , so you 're not one of them . " <p> " Shit , " Gerald cursed . He stared at the door . " You tried breaking out ? " <p> " First thing , " Rich said . " I was the first in . I tried alone . Then me and Paul tried . Then Mike , Alan and Duane when they got here . That door 's solid steel , got ta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast it open . " <p> " Shit , I need a cigarette . " Gerald said . " Anybody got one ? " Paul told Alan to check the food delivery . Sometimes there were what they jokingly called " smokes " included . Alan came back with a crumpled Viceroy pack containing three home-rolled cigarettes . There was a book of matches , too . Paul held out the pack . <p> " You can smoke these but they 're not tobacco , " he said . <p> " What are they ? " Gerald asked , eyeing the cigarettes . <p> " We think they 're shit , " Paul said . <p> " You mean as in ass muffins ? " Gerald replied . Paul nodded . Suddenly he did n't want a cigarette anymore and left the pack with Paul . " How about you guys ? " Gerald asked . " How did you get here ? " " We wish we knew , " Paul answered . " None of us knew each other before , were in or even near the same places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why we should have been abducted . We do n't even know how we were drugged , just like you . " " So one minute you 're eating a hooker 's pussy and the next . . . " Gerald began . <p> " Exactly , " said Paul , who 'd pulled up a chair and sat on it wrongside out , with his arms hanging over the back . " We 're waking up in here . Except that it 's been a long while since anybody else has joined our select group , " he went on . <p> " Yeah , so what ? " asked Gerald . <p> " So maybe something might happen , " Mike answered . " We 've been getting the feeling the other shoe 's about to drop lately . Now that you 're here . " He shrugged . " Who knows ? " <p> Having learned nothing of value from Gerald , they set about eating the food that had come through the Judas hole a little while after they had awakened from their probably drugged sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all lost consciousness at around the same time , soon after the lights went out , they suspected gas was pumped into the room , probably from the ventilation ducts near the ceiling . That would explain how the new arrivals could be put in the room without the others knowing it and how objects came and went from time to time . <p> The food was all canned goods , and the cans were usually dented , like the kind that were supermarket rejects . In order to get at the food , their keeper or keepers provided them with only a single rusty can opener-the " church key " they called it-and from time to time even that mysteriously disappeared , leaving them with cans they had no way of opening . <p> Then the can opener would reappear , often in the most unlikely places . Alan had awakened one " morning , " for example , to find it sticking out of his asshole , while in Rich 's case , it had been surgically inserted into the fleshy muscle of his left calf . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others could eat and drink , he had been forced to submit to the torture of its removal without benefit of anesthesia or antiseptics . Though Paul had done his best to sterilize the wound , all they could use was urine and strips of Rich 's shirt for a sanitary dressing . Rich had bled for days and now limped noticeably , though Paul claimed he 'd been fortunate not to have developed gangrene . <p> Rich 's was n't the only injury suffered during captivity . They 'd all been abused . Out of all of them , only Alan had not yet been hurt , although Alan was one of those who had operation scars on his head-two white , horizontal lines visible high on his forehead and his escape from harm was probably due to pure chance . <p> Mike had gone crazy one day and hallucinated that plastic robot insects were swarming all over his body and sucking out his blood . He had lost his nipples fiercely rubbing his body against the cinderblock walls in an attempt to rid himself of the parasites nobody but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when somebody had attacked him and sucked one of his eyeballs out . The memory of precisely which person had been somehow obliterated from the group . <p> Paul himself had suffered the worst experience of them all . One morning , they had awakened to find that Paul had been transformed into a woman . Not just any woman , but the most beautiful woman any of them had ever laid eyes on , even though she resembled Paul closely enough so that there was no mistaking who it was . She had come to them naked , like Athena risen from the head of Zeus , and she came on to all of them , wanting sex . <p> Somehow , despite their weakness and injuries , the other four inmates found themselves as overstimulated as the she-Paul . Their sexual organs had become grotesquely enlarged and they could have sex for days on end without tiring . The fucking went on and on , despite their noticing that the she-Paul had gotten pregnant and that her belly was swelling out to monstrous proportions . <p> Their copulations continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womb was the size of an inflatable life raft , and then , in the middle of a clusterfuck , the she-Paul 's brood sack suddenly burst open . That 's when the giant caterpillars with the human faces made their appearance . The things were five , six feet long , as big as Alsatians , and incredibly strong . <p> They attacked the other four , knocked them down and raped them , inserting rubbery , tentacle-like parts from their mouth things down their throats and other flexible , probing organs into their rectums , which they could feel somehow joining inside them , and causing them excruciating agony . It seemed like they suffered through entire days of this , even when the " night " came and the lights went off , until one " morning " they awoke and everything was the same as it had been before . Even Paul was back to normal again . <p> This was the last of the episodes of that type for a long time . Since the debauch , real or hallucinatory , they had simply been waking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , adding to the already sizeable agglomeration of shit and piss in the toilet area , and going to sleep at " night . " There were no more warped hallucinations , no more twisted games with the can opener , nothing out of the ordinary except for the essential dilemma of where they were . Their routine had become one of endless monotony . <p> And this is why it had occurred to all of them that something new was about to happen , that the conditions of their captivity would soon be taking a new turn for the better or worse . Gerald 's appearance seemed to be confirmation that things would be changing soon . It was the first break in the monotony in . . . well , in a very long time . <p> It was Alan who first noticed something taking form at one corner of the room . This was while they were finishing eating the last of the dented cans of Heinz lima beans from the food delivery . <p> With the can , from which he had been slopping rancid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat stock still and stared at the apparition as it took form . He called to the others , who looked in the direction of what Alan saw , which was a male human figure , wearing casual clothes , and a plain blue ball cap . He stood near the door and looked at the six captives with a bemused expression , but he did n't say a word until they had all silently approached him . <p> " Do you know me ? " he asked . " Huh , assholes ? Do you know me ? " <p> " Do n't tell me we 're in an American Express commercial ? " Gerald , whose sense of humor had not yet been killed by adversity , said . <p> " Oh , you 're quick , I 'll give you that , " the guy responded . " You 're really very , very quick . " <p> " Jump this guy , " Gerald shouted . " He 's from outside . " He made a move toward the figure and crashed right through it , hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , so you 're some kind of hologram or something , " Paul shouted . " Who the fuck are you ? " <p> " So you do n't know me , right ? Do n't answer that . You do n't have to answer that . I 'll tell you who I am . I 'm the guy who put you here , that 's who I am . I 'm the guy who had all six of you drugged , abducted and brought to his place , which might , or might not be on a remote island somewhere in the Mediterranean that I happen to own . " <p> " Why , man ? " Alan shouted . " Why 'd you do this to us ? " <p> " Ah , there 's the fuckin ' rub ! " the guy answered back , patting Alan on the cheek with a solid-feeling hand . " But you have a right to ask . After all you 've been through , you got a right to know . So I 'll tell you . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together to get revenge . " <p> " Revenge on who exactly ? " Paul asked . <p> " Ah , " he said , with a broad grin . " Now you 're getting to the heart of the matter . Who indeed ? " <p> " Fuck you and your riddles , " Gerald cursed . " Talk straight , you prick ! " <p> " Spoken like a true asshole , " the guy told him . " Okay Here 's how it is . One of you dickwads has made a very serious boo-boo . This guy fucked me over . But he fucked with the wrong guy when he fucked with me . The other five of you are innocent , at least as far as I 'm concerned because nobody 's really innocent , if you get my drift . I chose you at random . " <p> " But why- " Paul began . <p> " Shut up and let me finish , jerk , " the guy silenced him . " Like I said , one guy is guilty , five are innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the guilty party and you kill him . How you do it is your own business , but if you find the asshole and kill him , then I 'll let the other five go . Scout 's honor . " <p> " Just like that , " Rich said . " We kill one guy and you let the other five go . " <p> " Yeah , and how would we even know which one is guilty , " Alan put in , " assuming we accept what you 're telling us to begin with ? " " How you assholes find the scumbag is your own business , " the speaker replied . " But yeah , I 'll let the rest of you walk.Just like that . Providing , of course , it 's the right one . That 's the catch . " <p> " What you 're suggesting is completely crazy , " Paul told him . " We 're supposed to kill one of us , without knowing who it is or what he 's done to deserve it . This is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fucking sadist . " <p> " Sure it 's a game , " the guy said . " What is n't ? But you think it over . By the way , you guys can call me the Doge ' from now on . As in the Doge of Venice . ' " Before he vanished he pulled something from a pocket and tossed it on the floor . " Read ' em and weep , guys , " he added . " But we 'll talk later . After one of you is dead . " <p> Then he disappeared . What he 'd left behind were obituaries from various local newspapers published across the United States . The obituaries were for every one of them , all six , including Gerald . The causes of death were various . <p> Paul was reported to have died in a boating accident off Cape Hatteras . Alan had been hit by a crosstown bus going east along 72nd Street in Manhattan . Mike was the victim of a robberymurder in a liquor store he owned . Rich committed suicide by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was described as " automotive machinery . " Gerald had died in a plane crash between O'Hare and LaGuardia airports , though his occupation was listed as " noted cellist " instead of " car salesman . " <p> " More mindfucking , " Paul said , after reading the clippings . " These could have been printed anywhere . " <p> " Maybe we 're even hallucinating again , " Rich suggested . <p> " Definite possibility , " Paul replied . " Holograms ca n't produce material objects like newspaper clippings , for one thing . For another let 's examine what it is we saw . I saw a middle-aged man wearing sunglasses in leisure clothes . What about you ? Alan , you first . " " I saw the same guy , but he had on a ball cap and was n't wearing glasses , " Alan said . <p> " I saw a kind of clown with angel 's wings , " Gerald said . <p> " I saw a blob , " Mike said . " Just a black , churning blob that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Rich had n't seen anything , only heard the " Doge 's " voice coming out of thin air . <p> " See what I mean ? " Paul summed up . " We 've all seen different things . It 's just another hallucination . " <p> " I do n't know , " Rich ventured . " This one was different . Especially the part about the obituaries . None of the other hallucinations left anything behind before . And none of them spoke to us . This one was different . " <p> " Yeah , and there 's something else I just realized , " Alan put in . " The lights they want us to , you know , make our decision . " <p> They looked at each other for awhile . <p> " What did that guy call himself ? " Rich asked . <p> " The Doge of Venice , " Paul reminded him . <p> " Hey , Gerald , " Mike next said , " did n't you say the last thing you remembered was being in Venice ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . <p> " So nothing . There was just this connection between what you said and what the , uh , Doge told us . " <p> " So what are you implying ? " Gerald asked edgily . <p> " Nothing . " <p> " Good . Because I did n't like the sound of what I heard . " <p> " But it 's funny , though , " Alan remarked . " I mean , that it 's awhile since anybody new shows up , and then you come along , and suddenly this guy , or whatever he is , appears to us . And first you say ' Venice ' and then he says Venice . ' " <p> They all looked at each other again , without speaking , and then everybody 's gaze fell back on Gerald . Paul stopped Gerald from being scapegoated by quickly interposing himself between him and Mike and Rich , who 'd simultaneously taken steps in Gerald 's direction , and for awhile Gerald sat isolated and brooding against the wall . But the rest of them talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more it looked like Gerald was the guy the Doge had meant . <p> And , after all , the lights were still on . For the first time in what seemed like months , the " night " had n't come . <p> Paul could n't stop the other four a second time when they went for Gerald , who punched Alan in the face and ran off , only to be grabbed and held by Mike and Rich while Alan and Duane punched and kicked him as savagely as they could . <p> Gerald was far from dead , though . Covered with his own blood , he managed to break loose again and run for the room 's steel door . He pounded furiously on it , but it of course would n't even budge , let alone open . <p> As they came for him again , he ran toward the room 's other end . They caught him by the toilet , and he went pitching into a large mound of shit . Rich broke one of the chairs across Gerald 's back while Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't help breathing it in . <p> Gripping the pieces of the smashed chair , Rich looked at Paul and held out the fragments . Slowly , hesitantly , Paul reached out . Then , morosely shaking his head , he took the fragments and smashed Gerald viciously across the spine , holding the jagged remnants of the seat and two chair legs in both of his hands . <p> After Gerald was dead , they backed away from the corpse , shocked by what they had just done , but at the same time elated by the knowledge that by his death they would all be freed from their prison . <p> Covered with blood and shit , without a word spoken , the five survivors approached the place where the Doge had made his first appearance , and waited for him to reappear . <p> They knew that he would . They knew . Because the lights were still on , and the night had n't come , and for the first time in who knew how long , they had done something that , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the circumstances a fairly close approximation . <p>
