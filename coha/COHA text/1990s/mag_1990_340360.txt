The Federal Republic is already Western Europe 's leading economic power . It should soon be even stronger : unification with East Germany will increase its population 27% and its gross domestic product 24% . In the near term , however , union will entail heavy expenditures for the Bonn government . Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced last week that East German marks held in private savings accounts , officially valued at about $100 billion , would be exchanged for deutsche marks on a 1-for-1 basis . Bringing the East German social and economic infrastructure up to Western standards over the next several years will require the investment of hundreds of billions of dollars . At the same time , the combined state should be able to find considerable savings by reducing the size of the armed forces , a step Bonn has already said it plans to take . <P> CHART : NOT AVAILABLE <P> CREDIT : TIME Charts by Nigel Holmes . <P> CAPTION : NO CAPTION )                    @
