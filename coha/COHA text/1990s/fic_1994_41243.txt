The snow . The scalloped drifts , the blinding desert of whiteness in the sun , the silent rain of flakes through headlights and streetlamps , the dry crunch underfoot . What else did she deeply miss , other than a particular friend , after months of living inside the vast , crowded , cacophonous tanning parlor of Southern California ? Her lover , a native named Thom , promised to take her to the mountains that sometimes emerged from a first-stage smog alert and hovered vaguely on the horizon beyond her apartment window  --  he would take her as soon as his projects achieved equilibrium . He used this word  --  equilibrium  --  causing her to think both of chemistry and the inner ear . Rain that had fallen for twenty-four hours with a disappointing absence of sound and fury would turn to snow upon reaching the mountains , Thom said to her , as she stared at a sky so colorless and lacking in depth that she imagined the earth to have skidded off its orbit , into some inexplicable , twilightish zone of the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself . Craving the thrill of descent which was an idea that made her shudder , wind like a maniac 's hands at your throat as you plummeted , out of control , into an inevitable spiral of darkness and death . She had always been prone to cosmically apocalyptic fantasies  --  the earth radically tilting , for example , or veering dangerously close to the sun , or colliding with another planet like Saturn or Jupiter , an event comparable in her mind to the crash of her Volkswagen Rabbit with a semi-trailer truck on a stretch of freeway where traffic sometimes did about eighty miles an hour . A propensity she blamed upon a childhood visit to an observatory , where everything , she told Thom , the heavy black gears of the telescope , the slit in the dome high above her head , the photographs of pockmarked astral bodies , the wealth of facts printed . in inch-high letters under plastic , had disrupted her sense of proportion  --  her equilibrium  --  so profoundly that she had thrown up on an animated model of the solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets revolved  --  Mercury a pea , Jupiter a jumbo grapefruit , and so forth . She remembered the tone of a woman 's voice saying " For goodness sake ! " and then the sight of another child empathetically throwing up on the opposite side of the display . She could see the absurdity and humor of this scene , but the recalling of it only made her feel , particularly when Thom did n't laugh , queasy and ashamed . <p> She had n't known him long enough to believe everything he said , absolutely , but when she turned the TV on to the six o'clock news there it was  --  people stuck in it , throwing it , sliding through it  --  snow ; white , pristine , glorious snow . Next weekend , he said , a little distantly , distracted by other ideas that often seemed to ring like a telephone in his head . She thought of his profession as busyness . Waiting for his coffee on a weekend morning he would poke the buttons on his wristwatch calculator while delivering a monologue containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enrichment . " The first time she saw him she was amazed by his golden , shaggy hair ; his George Hamilton tan ; his baggy shorts and T-shirt that her mind removed in an act of giddy , pubescent daring that turned the imagined scene into a fifties beach party , replete with longings that in the spirit of those Eisenhower years had to be tortured into a phony Gidget-like wholesomeness . <p> " Are you a surfer ? " she had asked , a few months removed from ice , naked trees , and a man who liked to cite a study purporting to prove that the mind works most efficiently between forty and sixty degrees . A man who had grudgingly turned his thermostat up to sixty-three when she came to spend the night . Whose face had faded , along with his letters , leaving the memory of shivering , shivering  --  her body wrapped around his , trying to steal his heat ; then sitting at his table eating breakfast in double layers of wool with icy fingers that fumbled with the butter knife . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a used car , she thought , glossing over its obvious defects and magnifying its few good points into grandiose virtues  --  but the longer she had contemplated this the closer she had edged toward a decision to escape ; to escape the cold , the cloudy huffs and puffs of lungs and engines , the skeletal landscape , that which seemed to have frozen not only the earth but time , making change unthinkable . <p> " I surf , " Thom had said , his interest in her appearing to have been nudged upward a notch or two . " If that 's what you mean . " She had n't conceived of any distinction between one who surfs and one who is a surfer , but had simply imagined a lazy passage of hours spent in anticipation of the ultimate wave , entire mornings or afternoons of sun and lassitude . But that , it turned out , was n't Thom . On a certain day of the week , at a certain time , he would call a number on the telephone and if certain conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his car and drive to the ocean , always to the same place , always for a specific , prearranged amount of time . The first time she had gone with him she had sat cross-legged in cool sand as he waded through the surf and paddled through swells , and she had imagined that when he came in they would lie together and watch the sun sink into the sea , and maybe even wait for dark and build a driftwood fire and make spontaneous love if there was n't anyone else around . Gidget , submitting to desire , shedding that giggly innocence that was just a euphemism for lust . She had watched a gathering of teenage boys in wet suits , their wholesomeness oddly undisturbed by the unselfconscious passing around of a joint . Then the curling edge of a wave like a long , green snowdrift had delivered Thom like a gift to the beach , but instead of sitting down and putting his arm around her after unwrapping himself and drying off , he had begun to describe a piece of property that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly abused , the way she had felt in bed with the other man , with the vast darkness and cold weighing in above her like a punishment meted out by adults , arbitrary , incomprehensible , richly undeserved . <p> " Thom ! " She called through the open bedroom door . " Come look , Thom ! " A miracle , or at the very least a phenomenon , the repatriation of the sun as if nothing at all had happened . The basketball ablaze above a panorama that she had seen only once , on a postcard bought for the man who had regarded her shivering as something mental , a quirk . The mountains normally obscured by haze a ragged slash of glistening white across a page of sky so blue that she had a sense of the infinite depth and time that constitute the universe . Standing in her robe at the window , staring at the sun restored to its proper place between the flat , gray roof of the parking garages and the thin , black lines of high-tension wires stretched between a forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she opened her refrigerator and then various cabinet doors , assembling utensils and ingredients for a breakfast certain to warm Thom 's heart . He appeared , a grumpy apparition , and she nudged him into the little nook where the table was wedged , brought him a glass of orange juice , got the newspaper from the balcony and poured coffee into the largest cup she could find . She mussed his hair and nibbled his ear , but midway through the pancakes that had turned out much too heavy he said that he could n't possibly leave , his projects had n't achieved equilibrium . That word again . <p> " The snow will be there for a while . It 's not going anywhere . " <p> She could neither agree nor disagree . Disappointment forced her to withdraw like a punished child into a barren little room with a chair and a book she had read so many times that all the dialogue was committed to memory . " Good morning , dog , " said the cow . " Neigh , " said the horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while she noticed that impatience had spread like a blush across Thom 's face , the way it did whenever she was dreamy or distracted . " Meg . Megan . Did you hear what I said ? " <p> " I want to go , " she answered , aware of her capacity to loathe him  --  him and the other man , or even the entire gender . <p> " You want . You want . " He raised the cup to his lips and his face was drastically altered by a scowl , causing her to wonder if the coffee was too weak , or too strong , or if he only liked the kind you bought in paper bags in little shops for what she considered exorbitant amounts of money . Her fear of his displeasure formed a hollow in the center of her self-esteem . She gazed at his chest , a triangular field of hair and a single , pink nipple exposed by the gape of his robe . The fear was displaced by a sudden , surprising glow of contentment , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inserted her hands beneath the lapels of his robe and breathed into the conjunction of his shoulder and neck . <p> " Megan . What are doing ? " <p> " I want to go , " she whispered . <p> " Megan ... are you trying to manipulate me ? " <p> But he said this with an inflection that descended with her hands , a tone of acquiescence to accompany them to the disarray of the bed and its promise of pleasure made inconsequential by the fact that her mind had already leaped the sunlit sea of roofs and trees and wires and reached the mountains , a brilliant , silent whiteness that was , she thought , suddenly , momentarily , the only pure thing that she would ever know . <p> Thom decided that the mountain highways would be clogged with skiers and therefore they would drive to a place in the desert where an aerial tramway ran to a summit upon which she would find a surfeit of her beloved snow . From his detached tone of voice , his asymmetrical smile , his lackadaisical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulging her . On the freeway he made calls on his cellular phone , leaving her nothing to do but gaze at the endless suburbs sliding past her window . She heard the word " Aspen " and wondered , without warning , if there were other women in the periphery of his life , women like shadows or ambiguous noises that make you uneasy in the night . On a recent weekend morning in bed he had begun to compare her  --  favorably , it seemed  --  with a certain woman from his past and she had clapped her hand across his mouth , a desperate act that he had laughed at , not taken seriously . As he talked on the telephone to someone about plumbing fixtures she began to imagine herself married to an entirely different person  --  a plumber  --  and living in one of the houses that were all identical , or at least so similar that she felt monotony and boredom hovering over her like a cloud . She and the plumber would have three children , a girl and two boys , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the casserole she fixed and watch TV and worry about paying the mortgage and the latest dentist 's bill . The life she had imagined with Thom was quite different , of course . There would be tony restaurants , airplane trips , hotels with doormen , women and men to clean the house and trim the lawn . A picture of ease and luxury marred only by the scratch of his voice on the telephone , always on the telephone , seeking , explaining , threatening , directing elsewhere the attention that she deserved an undivided portion of . The plumber would detail his struggles with a stopped-up toilet but would also listen with compassion to her account of whiny kids . Would Thom ! Would he ? The question loomed like the cloud she noticed for the first time in a distant corner of the horizon ; a drab , possibly innocuous cloud that nevertheless threatened to spread like a stain across the sky , to swallow the sun and manufacture more of the dispiriting rain . <p> Outside the car the air was distinctly cool . She stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial section of the tramway  --  a pair of spindly erector-set towers and a black thread of cables that dangerously sagged . She followed Thom into a stream of people entering a cinder-block building . Standing in line to buy tickets , she hugged his arm . <p> " Scared ? " <p> " I 'm nervous . " <p> They followed arrows into a barren , chilly , cavernous space containing a fenced-off pit in which enormous gears turned , groaning and creaking . The telescope again . She took slow , measured breaths . <p> " Meg , " he said , as they were carried in a surge toward the car that looked to her incapable of lifting all that weight to the top of a mountain . " Just hold on to me . " <p> She felt charmed , softened , afraid in that deeply primal manner but willing to trust him without condition and reflection , as a child trusts an adult . She glimpsed the patriarchal lopsidedness of this relationship , but before she could examine it there was a little jerk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape outside and below the panoramic windows began to slip away under their feet . She shut her eyes for a moment and breathed deliberately . <p> " Megan ? Are you O.K. ? " <p> " A little dizzy . " When the car reached the first of a series of towers from which the cable was hung there was a little hitch in their forward motion , then a momentary sinking that elicited a chorus of " oooooh " from the passengers and promoted in her mind the fantasy of being dropped like a toy from the hand of a careless child , onto the fatally jagged rocks below . It would be totally inappropriate , she thought , to throw up . She concentrated on feeling the air grow steadily colder on her skin . The cold implied snow , and as their motion swelled and sank past another tower  --  " oooooooh "  --  she disregarded Thom 's warning and looked down to see , in the shade cast by a boulder , a palm-sized patch of white . <p> Within minutes they were lifted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were painted upon an undulant field of white . Directly ahead was a long , low building around which figures in down jackets and ski caps moved like extras in some cinematic extravaganza , milling about in costume , waiting to be told what to do . The car slowed with a jerky motion that caused it to swing precipitously , and then the sun was erased by the wooden ceiling and walls of a cave in which more of the dark gears revolved . <p> " How about a drink ? " Thom asked , when they were once again on solid , immutable ground . <p> " No , Thom ! " <p> They were in a building crowded with movement and noise that echoed from a vast ceiling of wooden beams and planks , and they passed an opening to a bar that emitted voices and the odor of cigarette smoke and beer . They passed a cafeteria that smelled of hot dogs and then a gift shop displaying mugs and T-shirts and silver jewelry in a long , glass case . They followed another couple through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , leaving them in a stillness and cold that felt to her profound and absolute before she became aware of voices rising from below . A sidewalk darkened by rivulets of water curved down into a bowl-like depression filled with adults and children engaged in various activities  --  building snowmen , throwing snowballs , constructing forts . A branch of the sidewalk led to another area where the snow was disturbed only by the tiny scratch-like tracks of birds or other small animals . <p> " Oh Thom ! " she said , hugging him with a sudden , giddy , adolescent passion . " I want to make an angel ! " <p> She lay on her back and fanned her arms and legs . Thom , remaining aloof on the sidewalk , said , " I hope you 're not going to complain about being wet and cold . " He said this in a grave , parental voice , but the cascade of sunlight through the trees felt almost hot on her face and she could n't take him seriously . He 's bored , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth of disappointment . She lay staring at the immaculate sky until she noticed off to one side a contrail beginning to break into little cirrus shreds , and she stood up and brushed the snow from her arms and legs . Thom 's face looked slack and vague . The word " Aspen " rose in her mind like the moan of a foghorn . She looked at some people waiting to take turns sliding down an incline in a plastic laundry basket . Beyond them she saw a group of teenagers dressed in jeans , boots , down jackets , but without anything on their heads . Their voices formed a little cloud of noise above their heads . <p> She looked at Thom , who appeared engrossed by the sight of a blond woman preparing to take her turn in the laundry basket . The basket was a green that she associated with such items  --  laundry baskets , garbage cans , pails . The teenagers also watched . One of them , a girl so strikingly beautiful that Megan felt a catch in her throat , opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flutter of birds taking off from the trees . Thom turned his head to gaze at this girl , to stare at her with excessive seriousness , to appear to desire her , to be inflated with lust that made him look buoyant , ready to float away . <p> " Thom ! " The woman in the laundry basket set sail down the slope with a shriek . " I want to make a snowman . " She bent to form a lopsided sphere that she pitched at him , but she had never been able to accurately throw any kind of ball and it struck the sidewalk and broke into harmless shrapnel of white . He turned his head slowly and gazed at her with a slightly puzzled expression . <p> " A snowperson , " she said , bending to make another snowball . She pushed the rapidly expanding cylinder in a crooked path until she could push no further . She rounded the edges of the irregular mass , feeling momentarily omniscient , as if the lumpy expanse between her mittens was an entire world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a pleasant , soothing feel . She felt creative , a feeling that unpredictably visited her but hardly ever amounted to anything because it lacked a purpose . Thom casually bent and patted snow into a sphere the size of a grapefruit  --  Jupiter ! She felt immensely expectant . But then he stopped to watch the blond woman drag the laundry basket back up the slope from where it had spilled her into a mixture of hoots and applause from her friends . <p> " Thom , " she said , hearing her voice to be slightly shrill . " What are we going to use for arms ? " <p> He did n't answer . Finally he bent again and urged his snowball forward so that it enlarged itself , picking up bits of leaf and twigs from the ground . She began , not for the first time , to imagine the women who preceded her , women not necessarily beautiful but glamorous women , self-possessed women , the sort of woman she would herself become if she only she could figure out how . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . Come put it on top . " The teenagers had wandered away ; voices had all grown distant , leaving her with the feeling that she and Thom had entered a kind of irrevocable solitude . He lifted his egg-shaped contribution and set it onto her base . She was pleased by the way he had finally gotten into the process if not the entire spirit of the enterprise . She started a snowball for the head , beginning to think of something more complex , more highly rendered than three spheres of diminishing size with twigs for arms and rocks or whatever else they could scavenge for nose and eyes and mouth . She thought of the Venus de Milo , and then of a goddess , white and pure and unbesmirched , radiating some sort of power . <p> " Fros-ty the snow-man , " sang Thom off-key , gazing past her . Some kids were now careening down the slope on garbage-can lids . She did n't want Thom 's attention to wander . <p> " Frosty the snowperson , " she said , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thom said . He grinned , and became suddenly industrious , forming a pair of snowballs that he patted and shaped and then stuck , side by side , onto the middle section of the body . " Snowwoman , " he said , stepping back to admire his work . <p> Megan stared at the figure , feeling that she had initiated something that she might not be able to control . " I do n't know , " she said . The breasts looked ridiculous , and after a moment of contemplation she decided to try to sculpt them into a more realistic shape . One dislodged and fell and he said , " She 's had a mastectomy . " He was standing , hands in the pockets of his jacket , looking pleased or at least satisfied with himself , but it was not an out-of-the-ordinary look and she was not quite ready to see him as callous , or insensitive , or any other thing that he might , indeed , be . She retrieved the roughly conical snowball and stuck it back into place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose and plowed a groove with her mittened fingers to make what she hoped to be an enigmatic smile . She stepped back and stood , staring . A prolonged shriek arose from a child sliding headfirst down the slope in one direction while a green garbage-can lid spun off in another . <p> " Nipples , " Thom said . <p> " What ? " <p> He scooped up snow and concocted a pair of grape-sized spheres that he pasted to the snowy bosom . He appeared to admire this refinement , which looked to her like buttons you were meant to push in order to animate something . <p> " They 're too big , Thom . They look silly . " <p> He squatted , squinting with concentration , then with a gloved finger poked a hole into the belly and engraved on the base below it a V. She felt suddenly apprehensive . <p> " What do you think ? " Thom said . <p> She did n't know , not really . She felt a little squeeze of pressure around her heart . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , as if she had just commented that she was cold , or had a pain in her toe . He stood beside the white , inanimate goddess with protruding belly , asymmetrical breasts and smile that made her look deranged . He put his arm around Megan , causing their jackers to squeak . <p> " Come on . Let 's go inside and have something to drink . " <p> " Thom ? " In the puff of steam that was her breath the name sounded like a stranger 's . <p> " ... Irish coffee ... " She heard this among other words that failed to make an impression . Her feelings , like his voice , had an undecipherable quality that made their intimate knowledge of one another seem facts memorized for no particular reason , mental exercise . <p> " It 's getting cold , Megan , " he said , in a voice turned up in volume just enough to imply some sort of threat . <p> But she did n't want to leave . The teenagers were returning on the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned their heads to look at Thom and Megan , at the snow goddess . The beautiful girl laughed , a high-pitched , bird-like sound . Thom bent at the waist and formed a snowball that he tossed from one gloved hand to the other . She felt a pang of vulnerability , the way one feels passing the scene of an accident , or hearing a siren in the night . He pitched the snowball at a tree , accurately , so that it struck and left a chalky smudge on the rugged blackboard of bark . Another thing he was good at . Surfing . Skiing . Throwing a ball . <p> " Let 's go , " he said . <p> " In a minute ... " She tried shaving snow from a shoulder but instead of imparting realism the change made the snowwoman look skinny , deformed . Within a few days , she guessed , the goddess would age an entire lifetime  --  shrink , diminish , melt to a shapeless lump . Or perhaps among the people in the meadow below was a zealot who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined doing this herself , denying anyone else the satisfaction , but she thought that Thom would view such an act as childish , and she told herself that goddesses are immortal , that they can protect themselves from any sort of danger , that they , unlike herself , need never be afraid . <p> They sat at a window in the bar that overhung the edge of the mountain , and beyond a drift of snow and boulders that looked like whales . The desert spread out below , a flat plane of brownness stretching away into a hazy infinity . Near one corner , partially cut off by the gray hump of a particularly old and mossy whale , the brownness gave sudden way to green , an oasis sprinkled throughout with white dabs of roofs , and shiny pencil lines of streets . A wider line crossed the desert floor and on it she could see crawling points of reflected light . <p> " See the road down there ? " A voice at her back , from an adjacent table . " Beyond the parking lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . Thom was gazing , not through the window , but at something in the room  --  a woman , she thought , a woman with an interesting face , and the long , slender , model 's figure that seemed to appeal to him . <p> " Look where the road curves just beyond the parking lot . " <p> She wanted to keep looking at Thom , to capture his attention , but instead she complied with the stranger 's command , looking down , beyond an approaching tramway car , beyond another descending car the size of her thumb , beyond the low , beige building they had originally entered and beyond a glitter of color that was the parking Lot , a series of flat places cut into the initial swelling of the mountain 's base . Beyond this the ribbon of road curled downward . <p> " That first curve . That 's where it happened . " <p> " What happened ? " said a female voice , a bored , indifferent voice that she suddenly wanted to imitate . <p> " That accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . " <p> " What kids ? " This voice , detached from any physical presence that Megan was aware of , was cool and seemingly disinterested . <p> " School kids . The bus lost its brakes and went off the road . About forty or fifty kids were killed . " <p> A dense silence followed , then ice tinkled in a glass . <p> " Nine , " said Thom . Megan became aware of eyes upon her in some manner that felt investigative and judicial . The man 's voice at the next table , and the woman 's murmured responses , rose and faded like music from the cars with boom boxes that regularly passed her apartment house . <p> " It happened last year , " Thom said , in the calm but emphatic voice he used to straighten out facts . " Nine kids were killed . Not fifty . " <p> " That 's awful , " said Megan , suddenly imagining herself pregnant , getting ready to give birth to a child who would always be in danger , imperiled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child that they would produce , a male child . She did not picture specific physical features but only a certain sort of personality . She felt herself frown . <p> " Thom , " she said . " What were you talking about Aspen ? " <p> " Aspen ? " <p> " On the phone in the car . " <p> " Hmm . " Again he was looking past her . Evaluating the invisible woman at the table behind , a woman whose voice had been husky  --  with a cold ? With sex ? " I 'll probably go in a couple of weeks . " <p> " To ski ? " <p> " Uh-huh . " <p> A picture of plummeting figures sunk like a stone to the pit of her stomach . If something happened  --  but the worst was breaking your leg , was n't it ? An image of him immobile in bed with an enormous cast on his leg had a disconcerting quality that she tried to shake out of her mind , like a cobweb or something caught in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend had arranged to rent , and in a tone ascending with enthusiasm he spoke of getting up , up , up for the challenge so unfortunately lacking in the local mountains . She wanted to listen more carefully but her mind was monopolized by a single fact  --  that he had not invited her . Had not enabled her to say , no , I could n't ask for time off work , I 'll miss you but do n't worry , just have fun . Had not even said , You could come if you knew how to ski . <p> " Who else is going ? " she said , knowing how distasteful he would find her little blossom of jealousy . <p> " David Gray , " he said . " You 've met him . And his girlfriend . " <p> She had never been to Aspen but she had read about it in magazines and suddenly concluded that she would hate such a hopelessly snobbish and artificial scene . There would be Thom , David , David 's girlfriend , but who would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't there ? She stared out through the window at the enormous bowl of crusted sand and stunted vegetation that was the desert , rimmed by the lumpy , dark , mashed potatoes of mountains upon which she could not detect a single patch of white . Someone thin and glamorous , an expert skier . Her own defects  --  legs too short , bottom too wide , bosom too small , neck too long , hair tending not to shine  --  lined up in her head like a clique of girls from junior high school , self-appointed to taunt her . <p> " Thom . " She stared at his skin , at this manifestation of health that had shone like a beacon the first time she saw him , in a room full of other people whose faces had all vanished from her mind . " It must have been awful . Those kids . For their parents . " <p> " Of course it was awful , " he said . " What else would it be ? " <p> She felt the floor tilt as the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the window and saw , standing at the bar , a young woman with a waterfall of tightly curled hair , crimson lips and a body that looked ripe , like a piece of fruit . A young man with a thin mustache appeared to be pushing himself against this woman , and Megan felt a sudden stab of violation . She looked at Thom . He was drumming his fingers on the tabletop , gazing at her or past her  --  she could n't tell which . She looked again and saw the young woman place her hands against the young man 's chest , as if caught between the acts of resisting and giving in . She thought of the goddess alone outside in the snow and something entered her body and ran like a shock of electricity up her spine and shook , jolted , vibrated like the string of an out-of-tune instrument in her head . <p> " We could have done something great , " she said . She imagined others looking at the sculpture , concluding that it was a joke created by sophomoric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . <p> " What are we talking about ? " Thom did n't look at her . <p> " The snowwoman . If we had spent some time we could have made her beautiful , instead of just something like a cartoon . " <p> " Is this important ? " <p> " Yes , " she said . She pushed back her chair . She was aware of having stood up and of Thom 's hand constraining her , but she slipped loose and crossed toward a slightly blurred rectangle of light . A man stood in her way but she brushed past him , through the doors that swung out into the daylight and the snow and trees . The cold caused her to gasp . The sun had sunk completely out of sight , and the faded white between the trees made everything look abstract and gloomy . She stepped across frozen trickles of water , heading toward the goddess whose expression at a distance was vapid and unconcerned . Another man stood in her path , a large man who filled her with fear , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pass him to get to her car . The man alarmed her by setting himself into motion , but he merely passed with a flicker of his eyes and a bland , impersonal tug of his lips and she stood very still and listened to the sound of his feet on the sidewalk and finally the hiss of the pneumatic cylinders of the doors . She sniffed and brushed an icy dampness from her eyes . <p> She stared at the goddess , and the emotion that had propelled her so abruptly out of the bar became an intense dismay , and then an anger that flared up and expired into a feeling of vast fatigue . Someone had poked a dark blunt stick into the point of the V that Thom had furrowed , and this violation made the goddess look abject and helpless . Was it the man she had passed on the sidewalk ? The boys she had seen at a pinball machine just outside the doorway to the bar ? The young man pressing himself upon the young woman ? She grasped the stick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of the goddess and shoved , and the head , beginning to freeze , tumbled and split in half as it struck the ground . <p> " Megan ! " He had waited , she supposed , certain that she would return , and when she had n't he had grown angry and thus the tone of parental frustration , an end-of-the-rope quality , in his voice . " What the hell is the matter with you anyway ? " <p> " She was raped , " Megan said , feeling resigned to a condition that felt like indifference to his anger , and to his self . On some level , she thought , it mattered enormously what had happened , and on another it did n't mean anything at all , and she felt suspended between these two extremes . The headless body did n't really look like anything at all and she kicked it , feeling nothing as pieces broke and scattered . <p> " Come on , " said Thom . " There 's a car going down in a couple of minutes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter with you , Megan ? " <p> She did n't answer . She heard his foot scuff back and forth on the sidewalk . <p> " I 'm going , " he said , with the precise enunciation of a parent instructing a child . " I 'm going down and then I 'm going to get in my car and drive down the road and get on the freeway and head for home . If you 're with me , fine . If you 're not , I guess you 'll have to figure out how to get there by yourself . But I 'm not waiting , Megan . I 'm going . Now . " <p> " Go , " she said . <p> " All right . " But he did n't move . <p> " Go ! " <p> He nodded , as if in recognition that something had not quite met his expectations . A set of waves . A ski run . He walked back along the sidewalk and she watched until the doors swung shut behind him . He knew exactly where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to do , while her own future remained as unclear as ever ; the immediate future particularly , what she would do when she got to the bottom of the tramway , alone and feeling anxiety just now beginning to form like ice on the surface of her mind . She saw the building , the parking lot , the descending road and the school bus out of control and smashing with a horrific gnashing of metal against the boulders that she had noticed on the way up , all shapes and sizes , geological litter . She gazed at the broken pieces of the goddess and decided that it was a mistake to leave anything  --  yourself , especially  --  exposed to ridicule and violation . To imagine an inanimate object with some kind of power to protect not only yourself but others from tragedy , distress , unhappiness . <p> She turned and walked quickly back through the pneumatic whoosh of the doors and found a line of people waiting to leave the mountain . At the end of the line stood the large man who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group of teenagers . Silently she said to one of them , " Could you give me a ride ? " Further explication came to her mind . " My lover  --  Boyfriend ? Companion ?  --  and I had a fight and he left without me . " A ball swelled in her throat and a mist developed in her eyes . As an antidote she tried to picture a map but beyond a large amorphous blob that was the city she saw nothing but the green and yellow and brown of unidentified land , wilderness . <p> " Megan . " <p> She looked up and saw Thom 's face . She did n't know if what she felt was relief , because the part of her that craved predictability was in some way damaged . He had n't left her . Did this mean that he loved her , as she had desired , at least until that afternoon , or did it mean that he could n't imagine her being able to fend for herself ? Because she had begged him to take her to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come by herself , driven her own car , done what she pleased and not found herself at the dizzying , nauseous brink of a predicament ? <p> They silently moved along and when they were in the tramway car and descending she could see a sprinkling of lights throughout the oasis that had turned from green to black on the floor of the desert . People in houses , cooking dinner , reading , watching TV ; people talking , arguing , making love . She listened to the voices of the teenagers , giggles , murmurs , sudden squeals . Then she saw the obvious . That it was all a fantasy that had closed , like an amusement park  --  the trees and snow manufactured for a moment 's diversion in the lives of people like herself , like the people with the laundry basket , like the teenagers , all tourists in this landscape . As she pondered this thought Thom put his arm around her shoulder and his face close to her ear , as if to whisper something , but he did n't ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slowly back and forth , in a rhythm so regular that she began to feel warmer , and , despite some contrary tone deep in her body , safe . <p>
