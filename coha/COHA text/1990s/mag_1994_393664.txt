When Ann Wood was a young girl , she painted birds and plants on the walls of her bedroom . She also glued on " dingly balls " ( cotton swabs ) as part of the design  --  and for the cat to play with . When Dean Lucker was a young boy , he built a miniature golf course in the basement and made balsa wood models of airplanes that he would fly , crash , rebuild , and fly again . Now in their early 30s , Wood and Lucker continue to make works that reflect the spirit of their youthful creations . Wood is still enraptured by nature  --  she 's a devoted gardener  --  and has yet to meet a surface she did n't like to decorate . She admits to being caught up in what she calls " that glitter thing . " For his part , Lucker remains fascinated by games and mechanical contraptions , and is a devotee of what might be called " that hardware thing . " Both individually and together , Wood and Lucker have created mixed-media objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the crowd-pleasers at the ACC Craft Fair Baltimore last February were a fan dancer , a chirping bird and a woodcutter who neatly splits a tree trunk . All are made collaboratively in editions ranging from 10 to 90 according to a schedule the duo has followed for the past six years . For one year Wood and Lucker work jointly , and the next year they work separately on individual pieces while also developing ideas for another edition . Ann Wood and Dean Lucker met at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design ( MCAD ) . Both are familiar with contemporary art  --  Lucker says he can " get off on a Rothko just as much as an Amish quilt . " But they insist upon the need to make works that , in Wood 's words , " can be held , can be intimate , and can get the viewer mechanically engaged . " As Lucker puts it , " I do n't want the work to be distant : it 's the friendly aspect , the welcoming aspect , that matters . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , as Wood notes , " Pinball would n't be considered as important as Vito Acconci . " Lucker adds , " That 's why I gravitated toward folk art after MCAD . To get " ballast , " to make a connection between the object  --  even as a mechanical artifact  --  and myself . It 's more egalitarian . " Wood and Lucker have been influenced by the " magic " of old toys , which they recapture in their work through motion , sound and the kind of participation required , for example , in a pinball game , where the viewer must set the metal ball in motion . They acknowledge their excitement at visiting the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe and being inspired by " people working from their own lives , from the world . " Yet they are the first to admit that " to call us folk artists or " outsiders " would be totally mistaken . " One of their major early works was a whirligig garden in Kellogg Mall Park in downtown St. Paul , overlooking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and human characters atop poles , each one as odd and delightful as the Cheshire Cat and the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland . Shortly thereafter , Wood and Lucker were invited to the Iowa State Fair to set up the garden and a whirligig booth . They were a hit with the public and experienced a surprising discovery . Shy midwesterners out of a Garrison Keillor monologue , they found themselves transformed into extroverts by the pleasures of talking with the fairgoers and exchanging stories . Where there are whirligigs , it seems , there are stories . Everyone has a story . Wood and Lucker have used their collaborative works as a means of paying the bills and providing time for their individual efforts ; neither has turned to full-time teaching . The production pieces , which are sold in galleries and museum shops as well as at craft shows , are a delight , but their creation and marketing demands hardheaded planning and methodical labor . Lucker and Wood freely exchange ideas for new pieces until a decision is made , a prototype is developed and fabrication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are but two of a significant number of talented artists in Minnesota and the upper Midwest influenced by folk and naive art , a group that includes John Snyder , Don Gahr and Judy Onofrio . All are part of a larger revival of interest in that genre among artists and the general public throughout the country . Some of the reasons for its appeal are clear . As an alternative to much modern or postmodern art , folk art has a freshness and simplicity that can be genuinely popular , that is , accessible and pleasing to a broad audience . It welcomes humor , mechanical ingenuity and personal idiosyncrasy  --  even when carried to the point where the results seem downright strange . Folk art often incorporates symbolism and attains seriousness without seeming academic or pretentious . In much the same way , Wood and Lucker 's woodcutter is both a simple figure carefully designed to perform a straightforward task and , since the inside of the trunk is labeled " Memory , " part of a lesson about how powerful revelations can be uncovered and about what remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lighthouse is a familiar and appealing architectural form as well as an icon of inspiration and guidance , especially when coupled with an arm hammering upon the anvil , an image of hard work . Lucker associates Tin Man with multiple meanings ; it is a self-portrait and an image of artists ( since the funnel head suggests that ideas can be poured in ) and of men , who are " armored " but meet their downfall if they cry and show emotions . Yet these interpretations are not exhaustive , since Lucker admits that he is at a loss to account in a similar way for a bird that appears from the forehead when a crank is turned . Wood 's independent work frequently suggests religious tableaux and emblems , but the scenes and motifs owe more to dreams than to doctrine . She says that dream imagery is a language " rich in visual metaphor . " Her pieces follow no traditional sculptural models , but do suggest a debt to Hispanic folk art ( especially Day of the Dead artifacts ) , to the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extravagant yard constructions that dot the Midwest , and to other sources , such as quilts . The pieces display great formal vitality , with brilliant colors and pattern play , and some surprising use of materials : one of her most ambitious , Flowers Bring the Rain , employs mirrored tiles as well as roofing shingles , laboriously hand-colored and layered in a diamond pattern . Yet these shrinelike works have a markedly somber , melancholic side . A group of three is devoted to the memory of a high school classmate who died in the Persian Gulf War : I Will Remember the Sacrifice , Life and Death Travel in the Some Boat and Class Reunion and Funeral . The last is as striking as its title . It resembles a combination pinball machine and coffin , with a skeleton laid to rest amid flowers and small pieces of rock in rows up above that seem less a scientific display than a reminder of how even ordinary things can appear beautiful when carefully presented and observed . At times Wood 's fascination with decay carries over into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deterioration an element in Tools of Change . With " Past , " " Present " and " Future " emblazoned upon the surface , the piece reveals a female figure suspended beneath the word " Present " in a situation Wood describes as " in-between "  --  neither on the ground nor flying . Around her are an assortment of elements that function as emblems , including a bell , a megaphone , a lighthouse , and  --  a wry touch-a small perfume-type bottle labeled " Courage . " Some of Lucker 's recent pieces are inspired by arcade games such as wheels of fortune . A nickel inserted in one with a small mine shaft scene at its center leads to either " a jackpot " or a " cave-in , " while in another it will give you a word for the day  --  " Timid , " " Generous , " " Motivated , " " Romantic . " Other works recall dioramas and museum displays related to industry or engineering , for instance , a non-game piece that is a beautiful small-scale model of a mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lantern . In Lucker 's work the fascination with the mechanical is clear , but only a starting point . From his early model airplanes through a series of kites he made in art school , he has always been interested in combining beauty and utility . Like Wood , he loves vivid colors , pays special attention to surface qualities  --  which in his case often means unadorned metal  --  and is concerned with the presentation of serious ideas as well as exciting forms . The woodcutter that is now part of the production line is a smaller , simplified version of a one-of-a-kind sculptural piece . And in a work called Boiler , Lucker not only gives homage to industry but , as in Tin Man , explores " what maleness is " by considering an artifact that is sturdy , functional , controlled , but with a " passion that is not exposed . " The latest group of multiples were made under the spell of gardening and flowers , and reveal a lyricism that is in sharp contrast to the darker sensibility often evident in Lucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with such motifs as the lighthouse , birds and wishing wells , represent , in the words of their brochure , " feelings of hope , mystery , and beauty . " Wood and Lucker 's approach is deliberately low-tech . Yet it is easy to see why these works , with their hand cranks , pinball mechanisms and other devices have found a receptive audience . This is " please-touch , " not " do-not-touch , " art , with obvious appeal for humans as well as felines .
