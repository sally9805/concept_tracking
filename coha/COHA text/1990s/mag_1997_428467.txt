After two unsuccessful attempts , Kirk Kerkorian is trying again to win respect in Hollywood . Can this feisty ex-boxer restore MGM to its past glory ? <p> " I was told this story more than once , hearing it from former friends , false friends and people who did not know him at all . " <p> Norman Mailer , The Deer Park , 1955 <p> <p> TOMORROW NEVER DIES , MGm 's latest James Bond film , pre-mieres Dec. 16 at Los Angeles ' Dorothy Chandler Pavilion . The typically overblown Hollywood event will display the usual sea of plumed glitterati  --  Bond stars Pierce Brosnan , Michelle Yeoh and Teri Hatcher , among others . <p> If the Bond film does well , it could give a needed push to the recently launched , $180 million MGM initial public offering for 14%of the studio . The stock has languished around the offering price of $20 since its Nov. 13 debut . <p> But for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and its 80-year-old owner , Kirk Kerkorian , the stakes are higher than the fate of just another IPO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try at making a success of a company he has owned or controlled off and on for more than a quarter-century . <p> Kerkorian is an intensely shy man who hates small talk and is uncommonly ill at ease mingling with Hollywood celebrities in public . Thus it is unclear whether he will even show up at the gala to sip a little champagne and rub elbows with the stars . <p> With his pugilist 's nose and workingman 's mien , Kerkorian was once mistaken for a carhop . In a town of grand residences , he lives in the one-bedroom guest house of a hilltop estate he owns above Beverly Hills , where he spends time with his girlfriend , Lisa Bonder , the thirty-something former world-ranked tennis player , with whom he is expecting a child . <p> The guest house is modestly furnished . No elaborate screening room with plush armchairs . Just regular TV monitors on which to watch movies . In a neighborhood bursting with some of the most valuable works of art in the world , Kerkorian has awarded the place of honor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dempsey fighting Gene Tunney . It was given to him by Frank Sinatra . <p> This , for a man worth $3.7 billion , richer than such fabled clans as the Fords , the Marriotts , the Bronfmans or the Chandlers . Kirk Kerkorian is richer than Ross Perot , the Rothschilds of France , Gianni Agnelli of Italy and most of his closest rivals in the Hollywood firmament  --  Ted Turner , Lew Wasserman , Sumner Redstone , Michael Eisner and David Geffen . <p> While the entertainment game has made these people rich , Kerkorian 's wealth comes mostly from Las Vegas ( more than $1.5 billion ) and , more recently , Detroit ( about $2 billion , see box , p. 230 ) . MGMitself has not made an operating profit in almost a decade . <p> So in trying once more to rebuild MGM , Kirk Kerkorian 's challenge is to demonstrate that he is a skilled filmmaker rather than just a buyer and seller of assets . This final push to gain acceptance in the Hollywood club comes at an age when most executives have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another high-stakes challenge only seems to energize him . <p> It is totally in character . Born in Fresno , Calif. in 1917 , Kerkorian ( the name is as common in Armenia as Johnson in America ) grew up with a sister , two brothers and his parents on a watermelon ranch near a hamlet called Weedpatch , on the southern fringe of the San Joaquin Valley , 100 miles north of Los Angeles . Kirk and his siblings rode horses , climbed trees and played in the barn and irrigation ditches . <p> Kerkorian 's father , Ahron , who arrived in America in 1905 , could barely read or write . But he was a whiz with numbers . He borrowed money and accumulated several farms , totaling a thousand acres . Fancying himself a gentleman , not a laborer , he cultivated the image of a swashbuckler with a temper , a Colt revolver , a handlebar mustache and a big Stutz Bearcat automobile . <p> Heavily leveraged and fearing foreclosure , Ahron transferred title to his land to 4-year-old Kerkor , known as Kirk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they named young Kirk a defendant . His first lawsuit . The Kerkorians were forced to leave Weedpatch and move to Los Angeles . Oil was later discovered on their former property . <p> Life in Los Angeles was precarious . The family moved a lot  --  just ahead of the rent collector . Ahron eked out a living selling watermelons to Los Angeles produce dealers . <p> Kirk , who earned pocket money selling newspapers on a street corner , ran with a gang of neighborhood youths who dabbled in petty larceny  --  stealing fruit from grocery stores and sneaking into movies . But their families ' strong values kept them out of serious trouble . On breaks from mischief , they lounged on each other 's porches , swapping dreams . Kirk 's was to box one day in Madison Square Garden . <p> The neighborhoods were tough , and fighting was a daily routine . Since the Kerkorians moved so often , Kirk and his brothers were usually the new kids on the block and had to prove their mettle to a succession of schoolyard bullies . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After they had bloodied each other , Kirk hit the boy in the Adam 's apple , sending him to the ground , gasping and clutching his throat . <p> The other kid turned out to be the son of a teacher at their school . So it was Kirk who was marched to the principal 's office , expelled and dispatched to a school for boys who could not stay out of trouble . There Kirk was introduced to discipline and corporal punishment in the form of riveted leather belts . <p> At age 16 , after just making it through eighth grade , Kirk dropped out . After a series of unsatisfying odd jobs , he turned to boxing , his older brother Nishon 's line of work . <p> Nishon , known as Nish , fought 116 professional fights as " the Armenian Assassin . " Kirk became a regular at a Los Angeles gym , which could have been a model for every boxing movie ever made  --  crowded , noisy , sweaty , bloody and great fun . <p> With Nish as his trainer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hawthorne Arena in Los Angeles in 1937 , the year he turned 20 . He won by a decision . Nish then drove Kirk north to Bakersfield , whose boxing arena was a converted barn with a dirt floor . Kirk 's opponent was a young black man with more experience . <p> The late Los Angeles Times writer Dial Torgerson described the scene in his 1974 biography of Kerkorian : Watching the other fighter warm up , Kerkorian turned to his brother and said , " I ca n't fight that guy , Nish . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " Look at him ! He 's no good . You can see that , ca n't you ? I might hurt him . " Nish looked puzzled . Hurting the opponent was the whole point . " Look , Kirk , just go in and put him out quick , " Nish said , " and he wo n't get hurt much . " <p> Kirk knocked him out with one punch  --  for $4 in prize money . Nicknamed " Rifle Right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing only 4 . He was the Pacific amateur welterweight champion for a time and wanted to turn pro . <p> But trainers told him he was n't naturally rugged enough to compete against professionals . At 5 foot 11 and 140 pounds , Kirk was too thin . He also did n't have a killer instinct . Kerkorian was disappointed , but as it turned out , he had already developed a new passion in life . <p> On a fall day in 1939 a friend of Kerkorian 's , with whom he worked installing furnaces for 45 cents an hour , took him up in a bright yellow Piper Cub above the then-smog-free San Gabriel Valley . Euphoric , Kerkorian returned to the airfield the next day to take a flying lesson . <p> Over the next several months he made himself a pilot . He studied flying with one of the most famous female pilots of the era , Florence ( Pancho ) Barnes  --  milking cows and shoveling manure on her ranch in exchange for lessons . Through a flying instructor , he managed to have someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had graduated from high school . That qualified him to be commissioned as a pilot as World War II approached . <p> Rather than enter the military , he trained for a civilian job with the British Royal Air Force , ferrying Mosquito bombers from Canada to Scotland and England . Only three of the hundred who entered training were graduated as captains . One of the three was Kirk Kerkorian . <p> The job paid well  --  $1,000 a month tax free , a big salary in those years  --  but proved to be as hazardous as many combat positions . The Mosquito was swift but fragile ; a quarter of those that started across the North Atlantic never made it . <p> Running low on fuel on one of his seven trips , Kerkorian almost had to bail out off the Scottish coast . He finally landed , but when the Mosquito stopped at the end of the runway , Kerkorian was seized by fear so severe that he could n't operate the controls . When he recovered and taxied to park , his fuel tanks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional pilot qualified to captain a variety of aircraft . With thousands of flying hours accumulated and savings from his salary and poker winnings , he was a seasoned soldier of fortune ready to take on new challenges . <p> Aviation in postwar America was a boom-bust world of fledgling airlines and seat-of-the-pants airfreight and passenger charters . Only two of the thousands of wartime fliers who entered the business propelled their success into the jet age . One was Robert Prescott , who founded Flying Tigers . The other was Kerkorian . <p> Returning to California in the summer of 1945 , Kerkorian spent part of his poker winnings and savings on a $5,000 single-engine Cessna and began his first excursion in flying charters . <p> Later , Kerkorian would fly to Las Vegas , then a treacherous ten-hour drive through mountains and desert from Los Angeles . Kerkorian loved Las Vegas ' frontier spirit , its starkly beautiful setting , its dry , crisp climate , its gambling  --  and its girls . <p> The girls liked Kirk , too , especially his thick , wavy , James Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married a Vegas showgirl , Jean Maree Hardy , with whom he would have two daughters . <p> The dashing young charter pilot had also become adept at buying and selling planes for profit and even made money cobbling together flyable planes from parts of damaged ones . He once tried , unsuccessfully , to sell a rebuilt Lockheed Constellation to Howard Hughes over drinks at the bar at the Thunderbird Hotel . <p> In 1947 Kerkorian bought another charter airline , named it Trans International Airlines , and sold it to Studebaker 15 years later . <p> With a nest egg of $1 million from the sale and an urge to invest , Kerkorian launched a spurt of dealmaking in 1962 that would set the tone for what was to come later . He paid $960,000 for 40 vacant acres across the Strip from the Flamingo , the 16-year-old hotel and casino built by Bugsy Siegel . He also bought back his airline , and in 1965 brought it public . An Armenian friend , George Mason , helped move the stock . Mason was a broker at the Fresno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mason urged them to buy TIA shares . Which many did , in large part as a gesture of support for Kerkorian , the only Armenian they knew of who headed a public company . When the stock reached its $32 high , Kerkorian 's majority holding in the two-plane company was worth $66.3 million . <p> Kerkorian 's luck on the ground in Vegas was good , too . Those 40 acres of land he had bought for $960,000 became a bonanza when the city 's then most extravagant hotel , Caesars Palace , opened on the site in 1966 . The owners paid Kerkorian $4 million a year in rent . After two years they bought the land for $5 million , netting Kirk a profit of more than $12 million . <p> In 1967 Kerkorian bought another parcel of land for $5 million and began planning the largest hotel in the city , to be called the International . Kerkorian also bought the Flamingo and used it as a school of sorts for training the staff of the International . <p> Rival casino operator Howard Hughes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like half of Las Vegas , then accelerated the construction of another hotel , the Landmark . It opened a day ahead of the International . <p> But the Landmark lost money from day one , and Hughes soon fled Las Vegas . The public flocked to the International , and the stock in its parent company , International Leisure , took off , buoyed by a booming stock market . Kerkorian had invested $16.6 million in International Leisure . By late 1969 his stock was worth $180 million . Kerkorian was just 52 . <p> The year before , Kerkorian had sold his flourishing charter airline for good , this time to Transamerica , a conglomerate that owned United Artists . Kerkorian , who had reduced his TIA stake to 58% , received $85 million in Transamerica stock . <p> As Transamerica 's largest shareholder , Kerkorian logically would have become a director . Despite many years in a mob-dominated town , he had managed to avoid business dealings with mobsters . But Transamerica was a conservative company and did n't want a Las Vegas type on the board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't like board meetings and did n't plan to keep his Transamerica stock for long anyway . By that time he had bigger plans : Hollywood . <p> " Not half a dozen men have ever been able to keep the whole equation of pictures in their heads . " <p> F. Scott Fitzgerald , The Last Tycoon , 1941 <p> <p> Television had driven the movie industry 's Golden Age deep into history . The business was struggling to cope with new audiences , new tastes , new economics . <p> Transamerica 's United Artists was what many people considered the new prototype  --  a studio without a studio , an entity for financing movies that did not own large soundstages or film labs but contracted out production and rented facilities as needed . <p> UA 's chief executive , Arthur Krim , was Kerkorian 's model as a moviemaker . The two of them were friendly , and Kerkorian 's interest in investing in Hollywood jelled one day in 1968 , when Krim caught a ride from San Francisco to Las Vegas on Kerkorian 's DC-9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial profile of rival MGM with the help of savvy Hollywood lawyer Gregson Bautzer . <p> Bautzer had long cut a colorful social swath in Hollywood . Kerkorian had aspired to know him since Bautzer had squired some of the most ravishing women in town around the dance floor of Ciro 's , a leading supper club of the Forties and Fifties . <p> The young Kerkorian , unable to afford a table , had watched from the bar . Now , in 1969 , Kerkorian and Bautzer calculated that MGM was worth $400 million , or about $69 a share , at a time when its stock was drifting downward toward $25 . <p> Kirk sold the last of his Transamerica stock in June 1969 . In July he announced a $35-a-share bid for 1 million shares of MGM , 17% of the company . Kerkorian knew he was not bidding for the MGM of L. B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg , the fabled studio of Gone with the Wind , The Wizard of Oz and Singin ' in the Rain . <p> He was instead bidding for a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managements . By 1969 its stock was 21%controlled by the Bronfman family 's Seagrams and Time Inc . The studio had been put in the hands of a group of young men fresh out of Harvard Business School , historically a recipe for disaster in Hollywood . <p> Borrowing $42 million from European banks , it took Kerkorian only two months to wrest control of the studio from the Bronfmans , who acknowledged their surrender over shots of Seagrams whiskey with Kerkorian . At MGM , which lost $35 million in 1969  --  at that time the greatest loss in the history of Hollywood  --  Kirk thought he could create another United Artists , which earned $87 million that year . <p> To implement this vision , Kerkorian hired James T. Aubrey Jr. , who had gained a reputation earlier in the 1960s as a smart television programmer at CBS . Aubrey , who was urged on Kerkorian by Greg Bautzer , had been out of a job for four years after being fired by CBS founder William Paley . Aubrey was so notorious for personal misconduct that Jacqueline Susann had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after him . <p> Known from his manipulative management at CBSas " the smiling cobra , " Aubrey reduced MGM 's payroll to 1,200 from 6,200 and sold off many of its assets , including the slippers Judy Garland had worn in The Wizard of Oz . All of which outraged Hollywood purists , who accused Kerkorian and Aubrey of destroying the historic MGM . <p> It 's a charge that would have resonated less if Aubrey had made even one good movie . But he did not . He made a lot of movies without taste or commercial appeal . He vetoed Jaws , which has earned $260 million for Universal to date . " Kirk wants you out , " Greg Bautzer told Aubrey in 1973 . " It 's over . " <p> Having made a mistake with Aubrey , Kerkorian made another . He installed himself as MGM 's chief executive officer and named as his second-in-command Frank Rosenfelt , a bland lawyer who had been general counsel . Kerkorian also brought in Walter Sharp , a friend and retired Bank of America executive who had accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was soon clear that Kerkorian did n't have the faintest idea of how to build a movie company . He seemed to think that his first priority should be to control spending . In fact , history showed the first priority at successful studios was to hire exceptionally talented people , giving them the freedom and resources to succeed within prudent but flexible spending limits . <p> Warner 's Steven Ross and Paramount 's Charles Bluhdorn knew how to do that . Having acquired their studios in the late Sixties when Kerkorian bought MGM , they demonstrated that with genuine talent , the upside potential was so great that even lavish spending could be justified . Thus Ross ' Acapulco retreat where he coddled top stars and executives . <p> But when Kerkorian hired a talented person , he did n't give him enough resources to succeed . Daniel Melnick , who headed production at MGM from 1972 to 1977 and developed a personal friendship with Kerkorian that survived their MGM days , was n't given enough money at MGM to make The Sting , which became a big hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chintzy , and that kept a lot of people away . MGM , where the bean counters ruled , was not known as a fun place to work . The glass was always half empty . In 1978 , when Arthur Krim left UA , it was Warner , rather than MGM , that landed him . <p> In 1981 Kerkorian tried a different approach . He bought United Artists for $380 million , and began pumping new money into both studios , which were joined at the top in a single entity , MGM/UA . But Kerkorian was still unable to attract talent . He tried to hire Frank Mancuso , Paramount 's widely respected marketing czar . Mancuso said no . <p> Inexplicably , Kerkorian turned to David Begelman , the man who ran Columbia Pictures in the 1970s but fell from power in an embezzlement scandal . More bad judgment : Remarkably , Begelman was the second of Kerkorian 's hires to have been used by Jacqueline Susann as a model for a villainous character . A lightly fictionalized Begelman had appeared in Valley of the Dolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's money at MGM/UA , but not one of his pictures  --  including the forgettable Rich and Famousand Buddy Buddy  --  ever succeeded at the box office . Kerkorian fired him in 1982 . <p> Meanwhile , over at Warner , Steve Ross ' men , Robert Daly and Terry Semel were launching one of the most productive regimes in the history of Hollywood , with hits like Lethal Weapon and Arthur . At Paramount , Bluhdorn executives Barry Diller and Michael Eisner were charting stunning achievements with Terms of Endearment and Saturday Night Fever . So stunning that after a 1984 power struggle at Walt Disney Co. , management hired Eisner , who proceeded to work his magic there , too . <p> Thoroughly frustrated , Kerkorian agreed in 1986 to sell MGM/UA to Ted Turner for $1.5 billion , but it quickly became apparent that Turner did not have the resources to pay . So Kerkorian agreed to buy back the MGM logo , as well as the entire United Artists company , for $780 million . Turner kept the MGM library , which he would use to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , which he promptly sold . <p> Had Kerkorian enforced an obscure financing arrangement that Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert had structured for Turner , Kerkorian could have regained control of the enormously valuable MGM library . He could also have gained control of Turner Broadcasting itself , including CNN and Turner 's other assets . <p> Under the arrangement , Turner was obliged to pay for MGM with a combination of cash and preferred stock . Typically , in such a deal , if the buyer can not make the cash payments , he supplements his preferred stock payments with additional preferred . <p> In this case , however , the deal called for cash-poor Turner to substitute common stock , i.e. , voting stock , in Turner Broadcasting . Kerkorian 's lawyers calculated that Turner would have insufficient cash for the foreseeable future and that within two or three years he would be forced to turn over so much voting stock that Kerkorian would control TBS . <p> But Kerkorian liked Turner enormously and did not covet TBS , even though its assets included the MGM library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his company , " Kerkorian told his attorney , Terry Christensen . " I want to help him keep control . " <p> At Turner 's request , Kerkorian supported a refinancing of the preferred stock plan . Several large cable television systems invested in TBS , reducing Turner 's control but enabling him to keep the company . At Turner 's 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow , Turner told a group at dinner , " You guys better be nice to Mr. Kerkorian or CNN might become KNN . " <p> Kerkorian 's unusually generous gesture toward Turner was typical of him . It was also typical that few people knew about it because the self-effacing Kerkorian did not broadcast it or any of his other personal qualities . <p> Since the beginning of his business career , Kerkorian has never " preyed , " as that term is normally defined in business  --  pressing every advantage , picking every bone clean . <p> Unlike many entrepreneurs who own companies , Kerkorian never charged MGM for the use of his plane , or charged fees or expenses to MGM to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of minority shareholders . " If you invested with Kirk , you had every advantage he did , " recalls an executive who was otherwise critical of Kerkorian 's stewardship of MGM . <p> Quietly and without any fanfare , Kerkorian has also given away many millionsto Armenian causes and more than 20%of his net worth to charities in general . <p> Despite his admirable qualities , Kerkorian still could not attract sufficient executive talent . The studio continued to lose money . " Why could n't I get it to work ? " he asked a friend in 1989 . " Why could n't I find the right people , the right combination ? " <p> So in 1990 he sold the company again , this time to one of the most bizarre characters ever to do business in the bizarre community of Hollywood , Giancarlo Parretti . When Parretti was brought to Kerkorian 's Beverly Hills office for the first time , Kerkorian , like most Americans who met Parretti , could barely understand him through his heavy Italian accent . <p> Several people told Kerkorian that Parretti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick film company , the Cannon Group , to health for a time , and he seemed to have access to enough money to buy MGM . <p> In November 1990 Kerkorian closed the deal to sell MGMto Parretti for $1.34 billion , or $560 million more than he had paid for it four years earlier . But the sale left him with great sadness . His failure to build the fabled studio back into a powerhouse had been the biggest disappointment of his business life . <p> Particularly so since the man he sold it to had turned out to be a swindler , a true predator . Parretti had obtained the money he paid Kerkorian for MGM by bribing officers of Credit Lyonnais , one of the biggest banks in the world . <p> Credit Lyonnais took over MGM in 1991when Parretti defaulted on loans . The bank had accused Kerkorian in a lawsuit of concealing MGM 's true financial condition when he sold it . <p> In denying that charge , Kerkorian accused the bank of all manner of fraud , which it denied . In 1995 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards , to settle the litigation , which had upset him more than any such controversy ever had . <p> Kerkorian found it ironic that in 1993 Credit Lyonnais had hired Frank Mancuso , the man he had once tried to hire , to run MGM . The bank was required by U.S. law to sell the studio by mid-1997 , and Mancuso had made it known that he would try to assemble the financial backing to buy it . <p> Kerkorian could n't resist one more try . So Mancuso got a call from him in February 1996 . " Frank , I 'd be a good partner , " he said . " I never thought I 'd ever go back into this , but you know I tried to hire you in the early Eighties . If you 'd been on board in 1986 , I never would have sold it . " <p> Mancuso , who had known and admired Kerkorian for years , was intrigued by the call but did nothing at that point to follow up . <p> Credit Lyonnais organized an auction of MGM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European entertainment company PolyGram and Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp . Credit Lyonnais wanted $2 billion for the company . It appeared after the first round that it would be fortunate to get $1 billion . <p> Frank Mancuso did n't bid until the second round . Early on the morning of July 5 , Kerkorian called his aide , Alex Yemenidjian , in Las Vegas . <p> " I read that bids are not coming in where Credit Lyonnais wants them , " Kerkorian said . " Do you think you could call your friend ? " <p> Yemenidjian had developed a cordial relationship with a senior executive at the bank , Rene-Claude Jouannet . Yemenidjian immediately called Paris , where it was late afternoon . Jouannet took the call . <p> " Rene-Claude , you still owe me a visit to Las Vegas . " <p> " I have not forgotten your invitation , Alex . " <p> " I understand that the bids for the studio are not coming in quite where you would like them . " <p> " I ca n't comment on that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just wanted you to know that if you ca n't quite get there , we might be able to jump in and help you out . " <p> " I understand . If I think you can help out , I 'll let you know . " <p> It turned out that Frank Mancuso was in Paris that day for an MGMboard meeting . When he returned to his suite at the Crillon , he found a message to call Kerkorian . <p> " Alex has talked to the bank , " Kirk said . " Can we talk ? " <p> " Yeah , let 's talk . " <p> Kerkorian then called Yemenidjian . " Frank wants to talk . He thinks we might be able to put something together . He 's very concerned that with all the other potential bidders MGM is going to be merely a division of another large company and it 's going to be lost , instead of growing as a separate studio . You know I once tried to hire Frank . " <p> " I remember . " <p> Mancuso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reporter said on Monday that he had " failed to muster financial backing for a management-led bid . " Kerkorian sent his plane to bring Mancuso to Las Vegas on Tuesday . They met for two hours over sandwiches in a small conference room at Kerkorian 's office . Just the two of them . <p> " We 've accomplished a lot in three years , " Mancuso said , referring to hit pictures like Get Shorty and The Birdcage , " but there 's still a lot to be accomplished . We still have a pretty good opportunity to keep the company independent , keep it separate . Most of the other contenders will break it up . " <p> " That was what I always tried to avoid , " Kerkorian reminded Mancuso , who then told Kerkorian that the only partner he wanted to bring in was the Australian television company Seven Network , which had been a customer of MGM for 40 years . That was fine with Kerkorian  --  as long as he retained control . <p> Back in Los Angeles , the Hollywood Reporter said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mancuso summoned his closest aides and told them of his conversation with Kerkorian . <p> " You know what ? I 'm not going to talk to anybody in the press about anything , " he said . " We 're not going to win this in print . We 're going to win it with a bid . " <p> Seven days later they did , with a bid of $1.3 billion . This time around , Kerkorian has not been stingy with the money . In July he spent $573 million to buy Goldwyn Entertainment and Orion Pictures from John Kluge 's Metromedia . <p> The purchase added 1,900 film titles and 3,000 television episodes to the MGMlibrary . Another library of 1,000 titles may be purchased soon . With 4,000 titles , MGM now has the largest collection of post-1948 feature films in the world . <p> Kerkorian also plans to increase production to 10 to 12 motion pictures a year , up from 4last year . One strategy will be to make sequels and remakes of well-tested franchises . Besides owning 17 Bond films , MGM owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MGMalso plans to release 4 to 6 " independent " pictures produced or coproduced by Goldwyn or acquired through distribution deals . <p> The key to Kerkorian 's success on this , his last try , will be whether he has learned from his past attempts to make sense out of Hollywood . Whether he will keep the bean counters at bay and let Frank Mancuso have the resources he needs to rebuild the studio . <p> All this was not far from Kerkorian 's mind on a recent Sunday afternoon as the 165-pound , aerobically fit octogenarian slammed vicious forehands across the net at his friend , Mort Viner , the venerable Hollywood agent , the man who waits in line with Kerkorian to see films with him at neighborhood theaters . <p> The owner of the world 's most famous studio prefers not to attend Hollywood screenings . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Hollywood Royalty , 1981 : Lew Wasserman of MCA ; Kirk Kerkorian ; Charles Bluhdorn of Paramount ; Pano Alfuso ; Barry Diller of Paramount ; David Begelman of MGM ; Frank Rosenfelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of MCA <p> PHOTOS ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The local press may have followed Rifle Right 's glory days in the ring , but they did n't know how to spell his name .
