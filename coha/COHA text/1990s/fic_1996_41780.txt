She spoke into our tape recorder . I held the microphone . Ellen asked the questions . We spoke to other women that afternoon  --  in Penn Station , at Port Authority , at a Manhattan shelter , and a few days later at a shelter in the Bronx , where we sponsored a reception for a delegation of women for peace from various countries in the Middle East . It was March 1991 . You remember , the Gulf War . The brief electrifying return of moral clarity , mass mobilization , gearing up for a long , indefinite season of protest , insurrection in the air . <p> All but two of the women doing this work were white . Most of the women on the street and in the shelters were black , and in the Bronx shelter , the better-funded shelter , a few were Latina . We were collecting homeless women 's voices . This was a project , part of a larger project that was part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair to bring together in one church basement all the women 's organizations serving the homeless and raped and battered women of New York City . ( I say " we " about all this , so let me be clear : I was one of many , anything but a leader , more tentative than the leader , a participant learning as I went along . ) One of our group would edit our tape of voices to accompany a slide show of photographs that another of our group was taking at the shelters and on the streets . The whole slide show/tape thing would be a powerfully constructed , collectively generated art object and take maybe five minutes to open our gathering of women . Other art moments would follow , as well as a variety of personal testimonials , but the main work of the evening would be the exchange of organizational information around the tables set up by the many participating groups . There would be an emphasis on empowerment . <p> Okay , so you get the idea . Let 's go back to Penn Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did n't hold our whiteness or our tape recorder against us ( or not out loud ) . They did n't care that we took a little moment of their lives away with us . They wanted the sandwiches and cookies and apples we offered them . They wanted our attention . They wanted us to listen . They wanted to be heard . They wanted us ( and you ) to sit down and talk to them , to hear their stories , to know how they got to where they got to be , each in her particular way . Not one of them said , Get out of my face , bitch , or Who are you , white girls , to take , to tell my story ? Who to ? or Why ? <p> Still , when I listen to the tapes , there are moments that make me uneasy . Consider this : Ellen is talking to a woman in the midtown shelter . The woman answers a question about how the shelter works for her , says the shelter meets her basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It all depends on who the shelter director likes , she says . Since she 's on medication , they just want to move her out . Ellen asks if anyone really sees her . The woman does n't understand the question . Ellen amplifies : Who you are , you , your own particular person . No , the woman says , no one does . Then Ellen asks what women could do to help make that possible , to help her to be seen , and the woman answers , thoughtfully and as if with a shrug ( as if I can hear a shrug in the tape-recorded silence ) : Sit down and talk with me . A pause follows , then Ellen says , That 's great . That 's good . Let 's end it right there . <p> To be fair , Ellen did n't mean this as coldly as it sounds . She had a relationship with the women at this shelter , maybe even with this woman , had come to this shelter twice a week for years , counts among her friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this distance , with only the tape to go on , the abrupt if warm dismissal is all I really hear . <p> What is the place , then , for witness , for gathering the stories , the images , the words , and bringing them into the living rooms and church basements , classrooms , lecture halls , movie theaters , galleries , museums , libraries , coffeehouses , and every other venue where homed people gather themselves in safety to encounter the rest of the world ? I want to know how we are going to talk about the racialization of poverty in this country , especially gendered poverty , women 's poverty , if , because her situation fits a stereotype ( to return to Penn Station ) , we will not talk about Henrietta . We , too , fit a stereotype with our tape recorder and our sandwiches and our outrage and concern . Does that mean we should be silent and inactive ? I wo n't say so . <p> At what moment does the issue of appropriation arise ? ( Homeless women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly homeless women , battered white women , and white women suing their fathers twenty years later for rape . ) At what moment does a problematic of representation become the issue rather than Henrietta herself ? ( And in whose interest ? ) Henrietta , who , chances are , if in 1991 she was sixty-three and homeless and HIV-positive and too scared to take her medication and had one good lung left from crack addiction , even if she detoxed , by now , chances are , is dead : Henrietta , with whom not one of us spoke again . <p>
