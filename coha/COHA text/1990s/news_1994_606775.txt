<p> On Sept. 29 , 1965 , Harold Bibeau walked out of his cell at Oregon State Prison and onto center stage in one of the darker dramas of American Cold War history . <p> Summoned to a prison laboratory , the 23-year-old inmate lay down in a coffin-like box and lowered his testicles into water . Then , researchers deliberately exposed them to a dose of radiation stronger than 20 modern diagnostic X-rays would give . <p> The experiments were part of a decade-long research project in the 1960s and 1970s , using prison inmates here and in Washington state . Funded by the Atomic Energy Commission , forerunner of the Department of Energy , and followed with interest by scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , the tests were designed to help determine how much radiation U.S. astronauts could bear during spaceflights , according to federal officials familiar with them . <p> In all , testicles of more than 130 prisoners in the two states were irradiated . Participation was voluntary , and the prisoners received small stipends and other cash payments for undergoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inmates say they were unaware of the long-term risks . <p> The experiments have drawn some attention in the past , in a lawsuit by 20 former prisoners in 1976 and in a 1986 congressional study . But detailed information about the experiments was buried until recently in classified documents and confidential papers . This report is based on interviews with surviving participants , prison officials and medical researchers , as well as federal records . <p> On Monday , in an attempt to shed further light on the prisoner studies , the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments , appointed by the White House , is scheduled to hold a field hearing in Spokane , Wash . The 14-member committee , appointed after Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary brought the issue of federal radiation tests on humans to national attention last year , is charged with determining whether financial compensation , medical tests or other kinds of follow-up should be given to participants . <p> Of the hundreds of federally sponsored Cold War research projects involving deliberate human exposure to radiation , including a series involving retarded children in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies stand out as some of the most shocking . The testicles are especially sensitive to radiation damage because they contain rapidly dividing cells that produce sperm . <p> Damage to chromosomes in the cells of a man 's testicles can cause infertility , raise the risk of testicular cancer and increase the chances his children will have birth defects . <p> Using an X-ray device , researchers beamed varying doses of radiation on the prisoners ' testicles . They later took biopsies to determine the effect of the irradiation . An article published in a scientific journal by researchers who conducted the tests said some of the prisoners were exposed to much as 640 rads , a potentially fatal amount if spread over the whole body . <p> Bibeau 's dose was 18 1/2 rads ; an average modern X-ray ranges between 0.1 and 1 rad . <p> The Washington state experiments were halted in 1970 , and the Oregon experiments ended in 1973 . As details have emerged , a handful of surviving participants have come forward with a list of medical problems , including prostate cancer , loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have resulted from the experiments . <p> Phillip King , 54 , who took part in the tests in 1969 as a state prison inmate in Salem , Ore. , complains of groin pains so severe he sometimes has trouble sitting down . Robert Garrison , 54 , another former Oregon inmate who recalls repeated radiation exposures over several weeks in the late 1960s , said he has had persistent rashes and a painful lump on his testicles . Bibeau reports lumps on his upper thigh and back . Another participant reported one of his testicles became attached to his scrotum as a result of one of the biopsies . <p> The participants also express anger about their use as guinea pigs and the lack of adequate medical follow-up . <p> " We can be blamed for being duped , but nobody ever sat us down and explained what the tests were all about and what the complications were , " Garrison said . " But worst of all is the deceit that we 've been subjected to afterwards . I ca n't even get a doctor to diagnose my problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't have to scream to get some kind of results . I 'm a human being too . " <p> " I took part in the tests and now I 'm in a lot of pain , " said King , who works at odd jobs in Portland . " I do n't know what I 'm owed , but I think I 'm owed something . " <p> Some of the prisoners have also experienced psychological problems , said Catherine Knox , director of health services for Oregon 's Department of Correction . " Apparently , no one thought about the effect it would have on prisoners to have their testicles irradiated , " she said . As a result , " some have had questions about their sexual orientation , " she added . <p> Most of the former prisoners interviewed have worked to establish new lives and to steer clear of further trouble with the law . Bibeau is married and has a 10-year-old son . Garrison , originally jailed for armed assault , is a grandfather who runs his home-maintenance business . <p> They gave various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a chance to earn extra cash . <p> Besides the $ 5-a-month stipend , participants received extra cash for biopsies and for undergoing a vasectomy , recommended by researchers to prevent them from having children because of the risk of birth defects from their radiation exposure . <p> For Bibeau , a former soldier , it was a chance to perform a patriotic duty . " I was just told that it was a way to serve my country even though I was in prison , " he said . " And I bought it . " <p> The experiments involving prisoners in radiation tests  --  and other research using mental patients , members of racial minorities , pregnant women and other vulnerable subgroups of the American population  --  have raised questions about the ethical standards used by researchers at the time . <p> " A reasonable person looking at the experiments now would conclude that they were ethically wrong , " said John Fletcher , a professor of biomedical ethics at the the University of Virginia Medical School . " At that time , however , the ethos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was nationalistic , and well-funded , and there was n't much scrutiny . " <p> " In order to justify using prisoners , the researchers would have had to make a determination that they are somehow less than human or less important than the general population , " said Dianne Bartels , acting director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota . Fletcher pointed out that until the mid-1960s , few rules restricted medical researchers from designing experiments . And it was considered acceptable to subject prisoners , mental patients or members of minority groups to risks that were not imposed on on the general population . <p> Since 1966 , all National Institutes of Health-sponsored research projects must be approved in advance by an independent review board . Rules passed in 1978 bar use of prisoners in any medical experiments that do not benefit them . Because prisoners are a captive population , they are not regarded as being in a position to give informed consent , Fletcher noted . Fletcher , who feels the experiments were wrong even at the time , said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . " Convicted of killing a man who tried to molest him in 1963 , Bibeau was sentenced to 12 years in an Oregon state prison . In 1964 , a fellow prisoner encouraged him to join the radiation program . <p> Carl G. Heller , a medical researcher at the Pacific Northwest Research Foundation in Seattle , who was one of the developers of the birth control pill , began the radiation program in Oregon in the early 1960s . The brother of Walter W. Heller , top economic adviser to President John F. Kennedy , Heller was well-known in the U.S. medical community . He died in 1982 . C. Alvin Paulsen , a researcher at the University of Washington , oversaw parallel experiments in Washington . Paulsen and Mavis Rowley , a former assistant to Heller , declined to be interviewed for this article , or to appear at the federal hearings in Spokane Monday . <p> More than three decades after his participation , Bibeau , 52 , now a designer and draftsman living in Portland , recalls the experiments in detail . He remembers Heller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $ 5-a-month stipend he received was spent on cigarettes , razors and candy . Above all , Bibeau recounts in detail the burning sensation he felt in his groin after receiving the radiation . " It was warm down there , " he said , " like I had been laying out in the sun for too long . " <p> Bibeau and other participants were asked to provide urine and semen samples to the researchers . After the radiation exposure , the subjects were also subjected to regular biopsies . <p> Bibeau recalls Heller warned him the experiments could result in " a burning feeling " for a couple of days and told him it was possible there might be " chromosomal complications . " Bibeau had a vasectomy on Heller 's recommendation . When he eventually married and wanted children , his wife underwent artificial insemination . " To this day I have no idea what chromosomal complications are , " Bibeau said . " How can you have informed consent if you do n't know what 's happening to you ? " <p> In a 1976 deposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in the experiments , Heller testified he " discussed the possibility of radiation burn to the skin of the scrotum , and ... discussed the probability of chromosomal alterations and therefore , the vasectomy . " <p> He also testified he mentioned " possibility of tumors of the testes . I did n't want to frighten them , " Heller said in his testimony , " so I said tumor . I may on occasion have said cancer . " A total of about $ 6,000 was distributed to prisoners in settling the suit . <p> About half the 131 participants have died , Knox said . A handful are still imprisoned at both participating institutions . In 1987 , the Oregon legislature passed a statute to provide follow-up tests to all survivors of Heller 's experiments . <p> James Ruttenber , an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Medical School , designed a protocol for the follow-up work . Ten participants have received checkups , Knox said , but the program has failed to receive funding . <p> " Time is running out for participants to receive medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may already be too late .
