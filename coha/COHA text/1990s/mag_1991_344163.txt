In the West , the most outrageous aspect of the crackdown on the Bank of Credit &; Commerce International is that it was so long overdue . But most Pakistanis hold a very different view of the global banking empire founded by fellow countryman Agha Hasan Abedi . <P> At home he is revered as a courageous Third World entrepreneur whose bank has been hounded by racist Western financial interests . In Karachi last week , the English-language Daily News made the extraordinary claim that " Jewish pressure " led U.S. authorities to crack down on B.C.C.I. 's laundering of drug money . Said Rubab Khan , a Karachi business executive : " This is part of the Western plot to seize all the money and assets of the Arabs and drive out the Pakistani bankers from international banking . " <P> Sinister theories also echoed in the Persian Gulf last week . At the Bahrain Marina Club , a Saudi computer operator explained , " It seems to many of us in the Muslim world that the bank is being attacked , at least in part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of B.C.C.I. 's criminal management may seem strange enough , but Muslims harbor even more elaborate conspiracy theories , linking B.C.C.I.
