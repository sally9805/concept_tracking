<p> O.J. Simpson 's lawyers and the prosecution clashed Wednesday in the fiercest battling since the defense opened its case , drawing a reprimand and an explosive outburst from Judge Lance Ito . <p> The most heated debate was a racial argument between prosecutor Christopher Darden and defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr . <p> Darden was questioning witness Robert Heidstra about a fight he heard between two men in the area of Nicole Brown Simpson 's condo at 10 : 35 p.m. on the night she and Ronald Goldman were killed . <p> Darden suggested Heidstra told another person he could identify one combatant as a young white man and the other as an older black man . Implication : Heidstra may have heard a fight between Goldman and Simpson . <p> Cochran jumped up , calling the question " racist . " Darden then accused Cochran of making racist comments that " created a lot of problems for my family and myself . " <p> Dismissing the jury and Heidstra , Ito turned to the lawyers : " I 'm so mad at both of you guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt . " <p> Then he took a 15-minute break to cool off . Darden tried to apologize , but Ito snapped , " It will take more than that . " <p> Back on the stand later , Heidstra denied he ever told anyone about the identity of the voices . " I never said that , never , ever . It 's absurd . " <p> The day 's ferocious fighting found both sides scoring victories , analysts said . <p> The defense drew a concession from prosecutors that the murders could have occurred during the time - 10 : 35 - of the argument Heidstra heard . Prosecutors had said the killings occurred around 10 : 15 to 10 : 20 , based on the barking of Nicole Simpson 's dog . <p> Time is critical : Simpson met a limo driver at his home just after 11 . That would have been after he drove 2 miles , washed and changed clothes , the prosecution says . <p> Six witnesses , climaxed by Heidstra , testified that the barking began later . " Without a doubt " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , but he added it still leaves time for Simpson to have committed the murders . <p> Still , prosecutors ' apparent change on the timing could hurt their credibility with jurors , analysts said . <p> Ex-Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi , who prosecuted the Manson murders , said the fact it took defense witnesses to change the time " magnifies the issue 10 times . It looks like the D.A . does n't want ( jurors ) to hear all the evidence . " <p> But Heidstra also served the prosecution . He testified that he saw a " white , van-like car . . . maybe a Bronco " speeding past the alley behind Nicole Simpson 's house . <p> Heidstra said the vehicle headed south - rather than north toward Simpson 's estate - but analysts said the damage to the defense was done . <p> A similar tradeoff marked the testimony of the next three witnesses : Wayne Stanfield , the American Airlines pilot who flew Simpson 's plane to Chicago the night of the murders ; and couriers Michael Norris and Michael Gladden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The trio offered evidence Simpson may not have had a cut on the middle finger of his left hand - the one that prosecutors believe produced a trail of blood leading from the murder scene to his estate . <p> Stanfield and Gladden both obtained autographs and spotted no cuts on his hands . <p> The prosecution drew concessions from all three they were n't specifically looking for a cut on Simpson 's hand . <p> Prosecutors also used the men to attack the defense position that Simpson was too crippled by arthritis to have committed murder . He was carrying bags , they said , and showed no pain when he bent to pick them up . Stanfield saw him casually stow a bag in the overhead compartment . <p> Bottom line three days into the defense case : a split , said criminal lawyers Harland Braun and Don Wager . <p>  --  Braun said Simpson 's lawyers scored points through the volume of evidence contradicting the prosecution 's case . <p>  --  Wager said the prosecution did well with the adjusted time . " If the murders occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alibi , then he 's still in the case as the potential murderer . " <p> Timeline of murders , based on testimony O.J. Simpson 's lawyers are piecing together a timeline challenging the prosecutor 's theory that Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were murdered about 10 : 15 p.m. on June 12 , 1994 . If the slayings were committed later , there may be reasonable doubt about whether Simpson could have returned to his estate two miles from the crime scene , cleaned up and made his limousine drive to the airport just after 11 p.m . The timeline each side has presented to jurors : <p> Prosecution witnesses 9 : 35 p.m. : After returning from McDonald 's in Simpson 's Bentley , houseguest Brian ' Kato ' Kaelin last sees Simpson standing at the door of the car . At the same time , Nicole 's mother , Juditha Brown , calls the Mezzaluna restaurant to ask about the glasses she left behind . A few minutes later , she calls Nicole . 9 : 45 p.m. : Nicole calls Mezzaluna about the glasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a waiter . 9 : 50 p.m. : Goldman ends his work shift , leaves the restaurant . 10 : 15 p.m. : Wail of dog is heard throughout Nicole 's neighborhood , a sign prosecutors say points to the time of the murders . 10 : 22 p.m. : Limo driver Allan Park arrives about 20 minutes early at Simpson 's estate . He is to give Simpson a ride to the airport . He does not recall seeing Simpson 's Bronco parked on the street outside the estate . 10 : 40 p.m. : Park gets out of the limo , buzzes the intercom a couple of times , fails to get an answer . 10 : 40-10 : 45 p.m. : While talking on the phone , Kaelin hears three thumps on the wall . Moments later , he goes outside to investigate the noise . 10 : 55 p.m. : Park sees a large , shadowy figure at the front door of Simpson 's estate and Kaelin approaching from the pathway . Simpson answers the intercom . At the same time , Nicole 's neighbor Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Nicole 's home . 11 : 01 p.m. : Simpson comes out of his house to meet the limo driver . 11 : 45 p.m. : Simpson 's American Airlines flight departs for Chicago . Midnight : Akita leads neighbors Sukru Boztepe and his wife , Bettina Rasmusssen , to the murder scene . 12 : 10 a.m. : Police are called . <p> Defense witnesses 10 : 20 p.m. : Francesca Harman drives by Nicole 's home on the way home from a nearby dinner party ; area is very still , no dogs are barking . 10 : 21 p.m. : Nicole 's neighbor Denise Pilnak sees a friend off , notices neighborhood is absolutely still . 10 : 25 p.m. : Danny Mandel and Ellen Aaronson , on a blind date , pass by Nicole 's condo and see nothing amiss , hear no dogs barking . 10 : 35 p.m. : Pilnak hears a dog barking , continuing for about 45 minutes . Another neighbor , Robert Heidstra , hears dog barking near Nicole 's condo while out walking his two dogs . 10 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metal gate slamming . 10 : 45 p.m. : Heidstra sees a car resembling Simpson 's Bronco speeding from the area .
