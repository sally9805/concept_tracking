<p> One reason Head Start has been so successful is the program 's requirement that parent and guardians get involved too . This involvement often inspires parents to believe in further possibilities for themselves and for those around them . Here are four stories from Appalachia , part of a series of interviews conducted by Sandra DeCosta , then Associate Professor of Early Childhood Education at West Virginia University . These stories describe teh circumstances , the struggles , and the victories of these very courageous women who found in Head Start opportunities for their children and for themselves . Ellen <p> Ellen is a widow and a mother of nine children . She quit school and got married after eighth grade and never had a job outside her home until she sent her first child to Head Start . Like all Head Start parents , she was expected to help out at the center , and she did  --  she was appointed the center 's assistant bus driver , and she helped the teacher with the kids . <p> The teacher told her she could enroll in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had , the teacher said , the potential to be a Head Start teacher someday . Ellen was surprised to hear that  --  it gave her a good feeling and moved her to try something she had never considered . With help from Head Start with enrollment fees , Ellen embarked on her GED . <p> Her husband had cancer ; he was dying , but he encouraged her to continue . He felt it was essential for her to have the GED if she were to take care of herself after he was gone . Although he was hospitalized during much of the time she was studying , he never stopped encouraging her . Just before he died , he told her , " You 're going to need this some day . You 're going to have to go to work . If you get the GED it will help you get a better job . " Her entire family followed her school progress and served as a support system and rallying force for her . <p> At first she was terrified of going back to school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Head Start . She often went places and never looked up or spoke to anyone because she was so afraid . Head Start gave her a variety of opportunities to build confidence . It also gave her opportunities to help others . <p> Ellen says she now understands better when the grandkids talk about being afraid to fail a test . She sees their nervousness and understands their need for help or just a quiet place to study . She also understands the value of encouragement and help . She tries to remember to say " the right thing " to her children and grandchildren , but especially to those adults who are just starting any training program . She has learned that sometimes two people can study together and ask each other questions in preparation for a big test . <p> Ellen encouraged other members of her own family to return to school . She was particularly concerned about her daughter , who had not finished high school . Ellen successfully induced a brother , a sister , a sister-in-law , a nephew , a niece , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them graduated together , sharing the same moment at one glorious graduation ceremony . <p> Ellen recently enrolled in an LPN training program and she is planning to be a nurse at the local nursing home . She says her husband would be proud of her efforts to continue to grow and develop . And he would be surprised to see how independent she has become . Darla <p> Darla has the look of a tired but fiercely proud , possibly even belligerent woman . She softens a bit after a few minutes of conversation , but she retains a look that says she can clearly hold her own in any setting . <p> Although Darla has four children who are now grown and gone , she recently took her 17-year old grandson and little Mary , a very young granddaughter , into her home . <p> Darla went to school until the eighth grade and then " stopped goin ' because we were just too poor to afford to buy clothes and shoes to send me to school . " She stayed at home for two years to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the boys in school . <p> While Darla never had a " real " job in town , she spent much of her life in the " chore service . " That is , she carried wood , washed clothes , took care of sick folks , and performed a variety of similar jobs or chores . <p> Darla was married for a brief time  --  " just long enough to get four kids , and then he took off . " She raised those four children as well as she could until she found another man . She and her friend lived together 20 years before deciding to get married so that little Mary could be " raised right . " Darla 's own mother had encouraged her to marry this man and make a true home for Mary . <p> Darla had n't known about Head Start until Mary was three . Then she began hearing about a school preparation program for little children . She looked into it and found that Mary was eligible . Darla had to put in volunteer hours at the school to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be friends with the teacher . That was when she learned that as a Head Start parent ( or grandparent ) , she could apply for an education scholarship and have her GED class fees paid . <p> Her reason for returning to school was simple : no one in her family ( parents and siblings ) and none of her own children had ever finished high school . Darla got to thinking she could be the first ! <p> She knew school work would be hard , but she was never afraid of this new venture , and she never regretted having made the commitment . During this time , she helped her grandson with his homework and learned enough about science from his books to help her pass her own science test . Darla said she always knew she had a good mind . She always had a lot of common sense . She took the GED test and passed it . <p> Darla says she has much more confidence now . She helps her husband with the little business he has : she keeps the books and sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is proud of Mary , now seven , and she 's thinking about her future . She is sure Mary could take the GED test today and pass it ! But she is quick to say that Mary wo n't need the GED because she 'll get her real high school diploma ! Darla hopes that Mary will be a teacher and " a woman preacher . " She helps Mary with her school work each night and encourages her . She knows how important it is for someone to care . <p> Darla 's grandson eventually dropped out of high school and now she is trying to get him to study for the GED . He has a girlfriend who just earned her GED , so she thinks maybe there is a chance . <p> Darla is thankful for the Head Start **29;59;TOOLONG for Mary . But she is especially thankful for the educational opportunities the program provided her . She says of herself that she is one old dog that learned a whole bunch of new tricks ! Martie <p> Martie is a woman of sixty with sparkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to , comfortable with herself and strangers . When she talks of children , she lights up the room . Martie has devoted her life to making children 's lives happier and richer . <p> Martie completed high school , although it caused many sacrifices and long struggles for her family . She even got a scholarship to attend college for a couple of years , but because of money problems , she had to quit . Soon afterward she married and the children began to arrive . <p> Martie 's first job was as a teacher 's aide with Head Start in 1965 , the first year of the program . She stayed with Head Start , attending all the workshops and inservice sessions she could . She decided she wanted to teach , and she signed up for Child Development Associate training . She completed the training , got her certificate , and took a job teaching Head Start youngsters . Before long , she was a full-time head teacher . <p> But Martie was not through climbing the educational ladder . In 1987 , again with financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university for more early childhood education courses . <p> Martie worried about returning to the campus . She was afraid of how an older person might be received . She worried that she would n't have friends and she worried about failure . <p> But her fellow Head Start teachers encouraged her , as did the parents of her students . She would often say to the Head Start children that she was a student in school , too . She had to study and so did they ! But Martie 's son was her greatest strength . He was so proud of her , she inspired him to return to college and finish his own degree ! <p> Martie feels that the greatest gain of her Head Start-sponsored training and education has come from the encouragement she is now giving her children and grandchildren . She is determined that they will all finish college . Victoria <p> Victoria is in her mid-50s , but she looks much older . Overdressed in several layers of clothing , toothless , and very nervous , she shifts around in her chair and repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few minutes of chatter , she relaxes a bit . <p> When asked about her previous employment , she says she had been a maid at several area motels , was once a nurse 's aide at the county mental hospital , had worked as a housekeeper , and now she had a wonderful new job in the kitchen of the school cafeteria . <p> Victoria has had ten children . Eight were in Head Start as far back as the original program in 1965 . Two grandchildren were more recently in Head Start . Victoria has been a volunteer worker in the Head Start Grandparents program . <p> She described her life as " pretty hard . " Although she is a full-time employee , her pay is minimal . She lives in a tiny shack on the edge of town with no water , no plumbing , no windows , and no heat . She says some of her children are building her a place with indoor plumbing and she is very excited about moving . <p> As she warms up , Victoria admits to being very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her children . She is especially disturbed with welfare department clerks , who she says treat her like " white trash . " Teachers have said terrible things to her children . In a small town , where everything is known about you , she felt like you really did n't have a chance to improve your life . <p> She got a high school diploma but she is n't sure how she did it . Years ago she had hoped to be able to get a job outdoors , maybe in forestry or agriculture . But there was never anyone she could seek out for guidance . She never knew if there were programs that might help her . She did n't even know if they let women do those kinds of things . <p> Recently , when her youngest child was 16 , she decided for the first time to try to get some training . A local Head Start teacher encouraged her to sign up for the school food workers program . If she completed the course , she would qualify for work in the school cafeteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria was actively involved in the grandparents ' program . <p> No one had ever offered her such an opportunity . While she was excited , she was also very frightened to try something so new and strange . The Head Start teacher felt certain she could succeed at the program and pushed Victoria until she enrolled . By the end of the first week of classes , the food-service teacher complimented her on her work . From that point on , things got easier and better . <p> " The teacher in the food service course really built me up , " she says . " Everybody else told me I was nothing , but she told me I could be lots of people all at the same time and be good at it ! I believed her and because of that , I succeeded . " <p> Victoria was often deeply depressed with her personal circumstances , but since completing the training program she feels more confident . Going to school brought Victoria some grief , however . " When I got the training , " she says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all them kids and take care of them . And when I 'm at home , they 're saying why do n't she get a job or into some training instead of being on the welfare . " One woman told her she could get more from a welfare check along with the medical benefits and food stamps than she could ever earn from a job . " Do you see what I 've been up against ? " she asks . <p> She likes the people at work and the responsibility that comes with it . She runs large machines in the kitchen , including one that kneads enough dough for 25 loaves of bread . That 's real power ! " I 'm going to stay with it as long as my health holds up , " she says . <p> Victoria is learning other things too , like matching up clothes , keeping healthy and fit , making her face look good . Those things make her stronger and give her the courage to face her problems and the outside world . Victoria now volunteers to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident enough to say this is what she wants to do . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS ( 2 ) <p> By Sandra Bradford DeCosta <p> <p> Professor Sandra Bradford DeCosta , formerly of West Virginia University in Morgantown , West Virginia , is now Chairperson in the Department of Early Childhood and Elementary Education at Indiana State University in Terre Haute , Indiana . <p>
