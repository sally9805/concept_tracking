SEIZE THE MOMENT : AMERICA 'S CHALLENGE IN A ONE-SUPERPOWER WORLD <P> by Richard Nixon <P> Simon &; Schuster ; 322 pages ; $25 <P> Looks like we have finally seen the last of the new Nixons . Anyone who remembers his campaign and White House oratory will recognize the old Nixon 's rhetorical devices from the first page of his new book , the ninth he has written . Once again we encounter the continual setting up of straw men , the self-righteous refusal to take ( or in this case recommend ) the easy and popular course , even  --  Lord help us !  --  the **31;165;TOOLONG with-Khrushchev bit . Some of the old class resentment and malice toward foes linger too . Doubtless Nixon genuinely believes Boris Yeltsin to be like Khrushchev in concealing a razor-sharp intelligence behind a somewhat oafish exterior . But when he scorns the American " foreign policy elite " for sniffing at Yeltsin because the Russian might not know which fork to use at a state banquet , he is rather obviously settling some old personal scores , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevenson , " he does not mean it as a compliment . <P> But the old Nixon also survives in a far more favorable sense : he has lost none of his sure instinct for gauging the force and direction of the tides of power in world affairs . For example , writing immediately after the failed Moscow putsch of last August , he predicts with remarkable prescience that the Soviet Union will dissolve into a " commonwealth of free and equal nations " that " will coordinate , not govern , the actions of republics . " Consequently , his advice on foreign policy is well worth the attention even of those who still gag on hearing his name . <P> Nixon 's central thesis is that the collapse of the Soviet Union presents the U.S. both with an unparalleled chance to help shape a more stable and peaceful world and with a great danger of a lapse into chaos and turmoil if the nation misguidedly turns its attention totally inward . He offers quite detailed advice on what to do about specific areas of potential trouble , generally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists on the continued importance of military power . If the U.S. wants to retain economic and . political influence in the new Europe , he says , it had better keep some troops there as well . Punishing China for the 1989 massacres of prodemocracy demonstrators by enacting a total economic boycott might be " emotionally satisfying " to Americans , but the U.S. " can not effect positive change by ruining China 's economy . " The thing to do is keep China 's free-enterprise economic innovations alive until the " neo-Stalinists " now running the country die and are succeeded by leaders who realize that " economic reform without political reform is ultimately unsustainable . " Arabs and Israelis , says Nixon , will go on hating each other no matter what happens ; the only thing that has ever been able to move them toward peace has been a belief that " the status quo was more painful than a potential compromise . " But that very consideration offers ground for hope , since the U.S. has " the leverage to make the status quo more painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
