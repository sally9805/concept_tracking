txt // So , based on today 's efficient egg production , the system outlined above and in use over perhaps two or three centuries to the 1940s seems exceedingly archaic . The main change in the current methods of rearing chickens has been to separate the egg-laying capacity from those birds bred for chicken meat . The latter are a different hybrid from the egg layers , and the broiler , whilst capable of laying small eggs , is usually slaughtered by 6 ? 7 weeks of age , before it is sufficiently mature to lay . Slaughtered even earlier are the poussins ' . Such broilers are reared in sheds and very much cheaper than the traditional means of rearing chickens . With both egg layers and broilers , a master or elite ' breeding flock is maintained , and from this grandparents and parents are bred and can be transported across continents , either as chickens , day-old chicks or as fertile eggs . Geese Fifty years ago , goose was a favourite luxury food at Christmas and on special days . If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipes for goose dishes in the old-fashioned cookery books . Why is goose rare today ? Because I think it does n't take at all kindly to intensification and the birds have rather little meat for their overall size . No doubt we intensively rear those animals and birds that we can , but for geese we still have a great deal of respect , as a result of their reluctance to do what we want them to do ( like pet cats ! ) . There are many species of wild geese such as Canada , Brent and Barnacle . These have remained essentially biologically unchanged over thousands of years . They reside in the cold polar regions in the summer and migrate southwards in the winter . Both wild and domesticated geese mate for life ( unlike many members of Homo sapiens ) and have very set patterns of behaviour . Both the Greeks and Romans kept geese , partly as pets or // guard birds ' , and sometimes to eat . Initially they tended to be red-breasted , but the Romans gradually bred the pure white type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure white geese are the ancestors of most geese today . In ancient Britain , geese were often kept purely as pets , but in the Middle Ages some were reared for food . Because geese require water to flourish , the main centre for geese was the Fens , in Eastern England . In addition to food , geese provided feathers to fill the inside of pillows and mattresses . Many of the Victorian painters of European farmyard scenes would include geese waddling in groups . With the decline of the mixed farm , geese are now the reserve of the amateur farmer , the smallholder and the enthusiast . But these are birds that we respect . Not just their positive social behaviour , but their value in causing a rumpus when disturbed and their ability to convert rough grass to a fine sward of dense green turf . Ostriches The ostrich is the largest bird in the world , the adult weighing about 250 lb. and averaging 6 feet in height . Not surprisingly , these birds can not fly , but they ca n't half run ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in parks may have seen them running at speeds up to 40 m.p.h . Ostriches are long-lived , with the female laying giant , snowwhite eggs for up to 40 years . The family unit typically consists of one cock and four hens ( and I do n't know what happens to the redundant ' males ) . Ostriches are impressive wild birds that are biologically important , if not unique , and should command our complete respect . So why are we discussing ostriches here ? Yes , you 've guessed , there are moves afoot to farm them and eat them . Ostrich meat enthusiasts point to its high-protein , low-fat content , and farmers say that rearing ostriches for food is more profitable than rearing cattle . Certainly in the wild , with the diet of ostriches being predominantly vegetation , the nutritional // content of their meat should be good . Already ostriches are being farmed in North America , South Africa , New Zealand and Israel , and there is one farm in the UK , near Oxford . If ostriches are to remain in wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare , but the increasing intensification of deer farming provides a warning . Anyone endeavouring to farm ostriches in the UK has to be granted a licence from their local authority in order to comply with provisions of the Dangerous Wild Animals Act . It could just be that this government might maintain this hurdle in order to protect the beef farmers from competition ! But new breeds of birds , and cross-breeds , can easily be created by genetic engineering and it would be simplicity itself to create a hybrid bird , part turkey and part ostrich , sufficiently docile for shed rearing . The thought of this is quite horrible ; surely we should leave birds such as ostriches as they are ; and would it not be better and more environmentally sensitive for us to eat plant material directly , rather than feed it to farmed ostriches ? Other birds Ducks and turkeys have all been reared for food since ancient times and much of the comment concerning chickens applies to ducks and turkeys . Today 's turkeys are descended from a wild breed found in the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 species of wild ducks . // The mixed farm In Chapter 1 , we discussed how soil fertility could be maintained by the use of manure from free-ranging birds and mammals . The point is this : even if short-term profits from free-range animals and birds are very much less than from those intensively reared , such forms of farming must be desirable as a means of ensuring soil fertility . Indeed , the combined arable/livestock system remained supreme in many parts of the developed world up to the 1940s . Since that date the governments of those countries have striven to improve efficiency by the deliberate separation of these two types of activity . Indeed , the consumer has come to expect cheaper and cheaper meat ? and has got it , not showing , until recently , concern over the way that meat was produced . With meat now an international commodity , in the same way as wheat or rice , once some countries embark on such policies of optimis-ing meat yield , regardless of long-term consequences , other countries may also be forced to partake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency since the 1940s and more and more self-sufficiency . The loss of hedgerows and woods , and the damage to the soil are all well known . For decades the public was to remain largely unaware of the procedures used in intensive rearing . But now the cat is well and truly out of the bag . In the USA , the issues raised by intensive rearing have received less publicity than in the UK , mainly because so often farming is intensive rearing . There are no alternatives . It is now an appropriate moment to consider animal welfare . Animal welfare It is often difficult to define exactly when cruelty to animals does actually occur . We can not tell what they feel , but we do know that in the main our morals have changed . We accept now a // degree of cruelty in animals that I do not believe we would have tolerated 100 years ago . I can vividly remember appearing on a television programme , arguing against the use of Bovine Somatotropin ( BST ) to increase milk yield . To my amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injected than not despite the large swelling that was produced on their hind quarters . I later discovered that this vet had been involved in the trials of BST , and therefore had a direct financial interest in the hormone . No doubt our morals are influenced by financial gain , and indeed by defending a way of life . I can not see how fox hunting is defensible , or hare coursing , or indeed the cause of any unnecessary torment of animals . Animal welfare concerns have focused mainly on intensive rearing of chickens ( broilers and egg layers ) , turkeys , pigs ( particularly those chained in stalls ) , and calves grown for veal in tiny pens . I am quite certain that if members of the public had been aware of what was happening to animals and birds as their rearing became more intensive , there would have been revulsion against the system 20 ? 40 years ago . Today the expectation of cheap meat must reduce some of the natural opposition to the system . A number of pressure groups are actively campaigning against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in World Farming ' . In the UK , great credit goes to Chickens Lib. from Huddersfield , Yorkshire . Clare Druce , on behalf of this // organisation , is rightly incensed by the battery system of egg production , which she thinks is illegal . Public pressure against this must surely mount , and it is gratifying to see that the phasing out of battery egg production is a policy commitment of the British Labour Party . Vegetarians More people have become vegetarian in the UK in the last 3 years than ever before . This must be partly a reflection on the publicity over intensive rearing and the feeling of horror of the unnecessary cruelty ? all for profit . Vegetarians are also increasingly secure in the knowledge that a completely acceptable diet need not contain any animal product at all . So let us look at the range of diet types . A strict vegetarian eats no meat or fish or other products obtained at slaughter , such as lard or soup stocks . Vegetarians do eat eggs , milk and dairy products from live animals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor any milk or dairy products , except of course human milk for babies . Another major group of people has emerged , which to the author 's knowledge is not identifiable by a simple slogan . These are people who do not eat fish , meat , eggs or milk produced under conditions of intensive rearing . So this would exclude battery eggs , barn eggs , most pig products , veal , and most ducks , and turkeys . Free-range chickens , pheasants , wild duck and deep-sea white fish would be acceptable . Then there is a group of people who understand that fish do not possess a nervous system as we understand such a term and do not experience pain as mammals or birds might . They therefore do not eat meat but include fish in their diet , arguing in particular that fish is an excellent food nutritionally . Intensive farming of fish will be discussed in Chapter 4 . Suffice it to say here that the world 's natural stock of fish is sadly depleted , and it seems inevitable that further controls will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mammals and birds ? a true horror story What is intensive rearing ? There is no simple or exact definition of intensive rearing . The systems used vary in different countries . It has also been inevitable that as the space required for the human population has increased , so that left for other purposes has shrunk . It is usual for most intensive rearing units in closed buildings to harbour animals ( this familiar term usually refers to mammals ) or birds closer together than with free-range , and also to be fed artificially . But there are further and probably more important differences between intensive rearing and free-range . These include issues of animal welfare , of profitability , of effects on the environment , and of the nutrients and safety of the final product . The movement of animals and birds from open spaces to confined conditions can not be traced to a single date . In any case , many animals , such as cows , inevitably spend some of their lives in enclosures , such as for milking . The provision of shelter for animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep free to roam on upland grass must on occasion be grateful for shelter from winter snow . Intensive rearing is not therefore principally concerned with the use of buildings in themselves . Rather , it is concerned with // the maximum yield of meat , milk or eggs from the minimum resources . Here resources refer mainly to the cost of feed , of human labour and the investment in such facilities that enable optimal yield . It just happens that sheds usually provide this . Put another way , the intensive system is aimed at extracting all the possible usable material from the mammal , bird or fish . The early part of this century saw a gradual development of intensive and also of partly semi-intensive systems in many countries . Initially , this included egg laying , production of veal and rearing of turkeys . The USA was prominent in these developments . However , in the UK , it was not until during and after the Second World War that intensive farming increased dramatically . There was pressure to grow more of its own food ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the UK ) and there was a belief that the diet should contain meat and eggs . The scene was set for the route to cheap meat . During the 1950s and 1960s , the American and British consumer 's attitude to chickens changed from that of viewing them as an occasional luxury , to an essential basic and cheap food . The era of the meat and two veg. , and three hot meals every day , was born . Everyone could afford meat for every meal ! It is only in recent years that this dogma has been questioned , partly as a result of the huge variety of ethnic restaurants in North America and Europe , allowing a much greater variety and freedom in eating . The two central objectives in intensive farming were thus established : to increase the amount of meat available and to reduce the price . And of course , if looked at in isolation , these are laudable targets . In both North America and the UK , these objectives can be summarised in just one word : efficiency ' . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the central preoccupation of our various governments for at least the last 40 years . Every aspect of intensive rearing has been analysed and researched . We know the optimum way of producing the final product , such as a wrapped chicken in the supermarket . We know , for example , the optimum way of feeding the animals or birds . This is usually through providing solid 1iiod and water // continuously or ad libitum . So to do this , large volumes of feed are placed in high containers ( hoppers ) with a gravity feed system including devices that ensure a constant trickle of feed to replace that consumed . We know that the physical form of the feed must suit the animal , and can be powdered meal , small grains or quite large lumps . We know , too , the components in the feed that produce the most rapid weight gain , the largest eggs or the highest volume of milk . We know the importance of cereals such as wheat or maize as the basic feed ingredient , and that the addition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know also the most efficient use of space in sheds . If animals or birds spend energy on movement , some of the beneficial effects of the tailor-made diet are lost . The optimum use of ideal heating and artificial lighting has also been carefully researched , as has the control of diseases . We know also how to breed the species most suitable for the system , both in regard to tolerating the environment and also for putting on weight . So the whole system of intensive rearing has been developed , improved and refined for optimum efficiency . In practice , the critical parameter with , say , broilers , is the speed of weight gain . Consider a group of broiler sheds . The annual costs of their upkeep will be similar , regardless of how many chicken crops ' are secured each year . This means that if chickens are ready for slaughter at 6 weeks rather than 9 weeks , then the productivity is increased by around 50% . Such increase in efficiency should result in a decrease in price for the consumer , increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely everyone is happy ? Well , not quite . The chicken is not over the moon , nor is the environment , nor is the consumer , when he finds out what is actually in the chicken , and nor are those responsible for public health . Let 's look at some particular examples . // Cattle The female of the species , the cow , supplies us with both milk and , at the end of her life , meat , with most of the edible animal going into burgers , pies , sausages , soups and so on . The typical cow lives to be 6 ? 8 years old at slaughter , has four pregnancies , the last three effected by artifical insemination 3 months after the birth of her last calf . In the wild , the cow could be expected to live as long as 20 years . The female calf is taken away from the mother after 24 hours ; the young heifer is reared until pregnancy and birth of the first calf , and then for the last 4 years of the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be convenient in the summer for animals to graze in fields , but their feed is often supplemented and there is always the prospect of higher milk yield were the animals to be confined to sheds . Certainly , some cows never see bright sunlight . The increase in milk yield ( even without BST ? see Chapter 2 ) may cause serious problems with the udder . Infection can occur . This is known as mastitis and will result in bacteria , pus and antibiotics contaminating milk . This milk should be excluded from the pool for human use and checks are made regularly to reduce the likelihood of this occurring . The unnaturally swollen udder dangling between the rear legs sometimes causes an awkward stance and gait and this in turn causes disease of the legs and feet . The male cattle are more likely to be reared entirely intensively , compared with the cows . Here the race is on to secure the fastest weight gain possible in the shortest time and hence command the highest price at slaughter . // Broilers Most broiler chickens are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds grow , their space becomes less . A shed might house 20,000 ? 100,000 birds and a typical growing period is 6 weeks at which time the cropped ' bird is 2 ? to 3 lb. in weight . It is possible that this weight gain might in the future be achieved by 5 weeks . No doubt the UK Ministry of Agriculture is working on it . Assuming 6 weeks of growth , plus a day or so for cleaning , a single broiler house may produce eight crops per year , or around half a million broilers . Well , not quite this number , because many will have died ? say 5% , or 25,000 . The broiler has been bred for maximum growth of meat , not for the strength of its bones or the vigour of its heart or blood vessels . It seems as if the bones and the legs just can not support the weight of the bird , so some limp , collapse and die . Or perhaps the grazing bird 's heart can not cope and it dies of heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect all the dead corpses on the floor on a daily basis . These corpses will usually be added to the heap of droppings accumulating outside each shed . The disposal of this chicken excrement poses real problems , and explains why incinerators may be needed just to dispose of chicken manure . The problem is that so many of these sheds occupy such a small space that there is insufficient land available locally to absorb the manure . On occasion chicken manure has been fed to cattle ! When freshly produced , excrement will have the pungent smell of ammonia , but gradually it becomes converted into nitrates that leach into our water . Nitrates in drinking water from East Yorkshire and Humberside in the UK exceed EC limits and are in part due to this . The environmental impact of this type of operation can be considerable . Lorries are needed to deliver the feed and cart away the chickens . Some of the feed contains the bone meal fraction from rendered offal , including remains of earlier chickens , such as heads , intestines and feathers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounders. // Bacteria such as salmonella would inevitably abound in the thousands of tons of droppings and rotting dead carcases which pile up . Vermin , notably rats , are attracted , and breed and multiply and spread them widely . Wild birds , too , feed off this debris , and there is the possibility ? apparently within the law ? of the excrement being fed to pigs or cattle . Intensive production of eggs There are basically three types of egg production , as seen in many European countries , under these cramped conditions . Most are laid by the battery system , where chickens are confined in tiny cages with sloping mesh floors . After an egg is laid it rolls into a collecting gulley . Feed and water are supplied continuously and the lights are switched on and off cyclically to give an imitation of day and night . Other chickens are reared in large sheds or barns which contain perches and nesting boxes , but the conditions are still extremely intensive . This is the source of barn eggs . The third type of intensive rearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed with a tiny pen leading off . Occasionally , some chickens do venture outside , but many seem not to bother . There are regulations in the UK that enable eggs from these flocks to be called free-range ' . This is a travesty of the real meaning of that word . I prefer to call these eggs pseudo-free-range ' . Because these chickens are the same hybrid as the battery , the eggs from them are just as likely to be contaminated with salmonella . So some eggs labelled free-range in the supermarket are probably pseudo-free-range ' and are no better than the battery . Indeed you , the consumer , have been the subject of a giant confidence trick , exploiting your emotions for concern over intensive rearing . It is hoped that in the future adequate labelling of eggs will become legally enforced . But until this happens , I suggest you buy an egg as truly free-range only if you can he certain // of the type of flock that laid it , preferably with your own eyes . Incidentally , one reason why the supermarkets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that this enables them to obstruct the tracking down of food poisoning and therefore reduces the likelihood of being blamed . Vets Recently , a leading veterinary surgeon claimed that free-range eggs were less desirable than the battery products . He then said that the organic beef herds suffered from more diseases than non-organic . British vets have been making extraordinary claims over the past few years . First we heard there is no salmonella in any eggs ' , then salmonella is everywhere ' and it comes from pigeons ' . May I suggest explanations as to why some vets ( probably a very few ) feel obliged to mislead the public ? First , it is guilt : they have condoned cruel and dangerous farming practices . Secondly , // intensive rearing must be associated with a greater incidence of disease than free-range husbandry , so the farming vets have a direct financial interest in these practices , as do the companies that provide the required drugs . Salmonella To return to salmonella , it has been known for years that modern intensive methods of broiler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister of Health , Edwina Currie , was right , even though unpopular , when she said in 1988 that most of our egg production ( my italics ) was contaminated with salmonella . In my laboratory in the UK , in the summers of 1991 and 1992 , we have identified more food poisoning bacteria from ill patients than ever before . The problem is not solved . Nor is it just a British disease . In recent surveys from Georgia , California and Carolina , USA , the extent of the salmonella contamination of intensive chicken and egg production is disturbing . Sixty per cent ( yes , 60% ) of samples of recycled chicken protein going into the feed contained salmonella . Salmonella was found in one in 10 of hatching chicks , 5% of broiler droppings , one in three samples from trucks used for carting live birds , and one in five of all broiler chickens . In 32 out of 42 ( 76.2% ) of flocks , salmonella was found in the ovaries from laying chickens . It is this contamination that causes salmonella to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the advice that eggs should still be cooked until the yolk is hard . Artificial feeds Most artificial feeds are cereal based . These cereals include powdered maize , wheat or barley and may be imported . The cereal will need to be compounded into a formulation with added vitamins , minerals , protein supplements and drugs to produce the // right nutrients and flow properties for the hopper and feed systems . Feed compounding is a skilled process and there are relatively few companies operating . The resultant feed from one central source can therefore be distributed very widely . This type of production is potentially very dangerous , were anything to go amiss , such as the introduction of an infectious agent . It can , however , be argued that because of careful monitoring and controls , and that test batches of the feed can be shown to be safe , therefore by inference the whole output can be guaranteed . Whilst fine in theory , the problems in practice relate to possible unknown ( and therefore not capable of detection ) dangers . Rendering plants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the risks multiply . In most countries the high protein concentrates are derived from the rendering plants . What are rendering plants ? Some parts of the intensively reared animal or bird are inedible . These include bones , feathers , heads and feet , and intestines . These products are processed in rather smelly and secret factories into two usable products . Fat or tallow is used for making soap , lipstick and other cosmetics . The other component is a protein-rich material that is further processed . In the past this has been referred to as bone meal and used as a garden fertiliser . Exactly when the practice of incorporating this type of material , now referred to as concentrates , into animal feed began is difficult to be certain about , because of the surrounding secrecy . It was probably in the late 1960s or early 1970s in most developed countries . The appeal is obvious . The unwanted waste material can be converted to a useful and profitable industry . When such feed is returned to the same species as that from which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the same way as the feeding to pigs of household bacon scraps . The rendering plant operators , the feed compounders and the // farmers would not have been aware of any infectious risk in this system . Surely the temperatures in the rendering plants would have been adequate to kill any germs ? With hindsight , we now know this is not the case . Unfortunately the infection that causes the cattle disease , Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( abbreviated to BSE and dubbed Mad Cow Disease by the media ) is resistant to the treatments in most rendering plants . This disease has already destroyed at least 100,000 UK cows and has spread to Switzerland , France and Denmark . It was thought initially to be spread by animals ' organs being fed back via the rendering plants ( for further information , see Chapter 9 ) . Fortunately , it has not appeared in the USA , but there is no reason at all why it should not in the future . This means that the whole system of interdependence between the rendering plants , animal feeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK government has prohibited the use of these concentrates being fed to ruminants , but strangely not to pigs or poultry . There is another skeleton in the cupboard . There are 7 million cats in the UK . About a million die each year . Many dead cats are disposed of through the rendering plants , after some of the skins have been sold for furs . Not very appealing ? But it 's worse than that , because the practice is dangerous . If you are still reading , let me try to explain . The first cases of BSE of the present epidemic occurred in 1986 . The first case of the similar disease in a cat called Max in Bristol , UK was reported in 1990 , presumably after eating contaminated beef products . Many cats are thought to have succumbed from the disease , which we will call FSE or Feline Spongiform Encephalopathy . So , if these dead , infected cats ( many may be carrying the infectious agent but die of other causes ) are treated in the rendering plants , then their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as pigs and also to poultry and then to us . Of course we do not know and can not tell for certain whether human beings can be infected with FSE , although we do know that the human dementia , Creutzfeldt ? Jakob disease , can he // passed experimentally to cats . There is no reason why the infection can not pass from cats to man . As the law stands , I think , in all countries , it is perfectly possible to dispose of dead cats in the rendering plants . It is interesting that it is now not permitted to treat certain organs of cattle in the plants in the UK . An immediate total ban on this means of disposing of deceased cats ( and other pet mammals ) must be introduced urgently . Instead , they should be incinerated . We will need to build more incinerators anyway , for the livestock remains that can not now go to the rendering plants . You probably did not want to read this , but most of you , particularly in the USA , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start . This is very bad news for the beef industry in the USA . Drugs added to the feed Drugs are added to the feed ( and water ) of intensively reared mammals and birds for two purposes : to treat and prevent diseases , and to increase their growth rates . It is the latter that gives the ethical worries . Antibiotics are by far the commonest feed additive for both these purposes and doubts over much of their use continue . Antibiotics are usually produced by microorganisms in tiny amounts and the pharmaceutical industry has become expert at concentrating and purifying these so that they can be used for treating infections in people ( and animals ) . Some antibiotics in use now are chemically altered natural products and some are completely novel chemicals . Unquestionably , antibiotics have revolutionised many aspects of human medicine . For example , meningitis , typhoid , tuberculosis , osteomyelitis and pneumonia all can be treated as can less dramatic but annoying infections such as thrush , urinary infections and septic skin spots . However , it is probably in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking . Soon after antibiotics were first used in human medicine in // // increase the spread of infections amongst animals and birds , and antibiotics will be needed to control the bacterial causes . But the use of antibiotics to stimulate weight gain can and should be stopped , whether or not intensive rearing continues . It was by chance that livestock , having been inadvertently fed the antibiotic tetracycline in the early 1960s , put on more weight than expected . This occurred in the USA and much confirmatory work done there establishes that long-term use of certain amounts of antibiotics in the feed of most intensively reared species causes an increase of weight over several weeks . The gain is not dramatic , perhaps 3 ? 5% , but this is sufficient to be decisive commercially . This means that if one farmer uses growth-promoting anti-biotics , then others may be forced into the practice . It has con-tinued because the pharmaceutical industry has been able to use its powerful influence to defend it ; surely any common sense or natural law would indicate it to be undesirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of intensive rearing of animals and birds . Profits before Ethics . Other drugs are also added to animal feeds , for treatment and prevention of disease and to increase growth . Most drugs are carefully tested and careful calculations are made to identify the time needed for the drug to be removed from the animal 's body , usually through its excreta . This means that animals or birds treated with drugs should not be slaughtered and subsequently consumed until adequate time has elapsed for that elimination to have been completed . Farmers and vets should know this length of time ( the withholding period ) and should comply with it precisely . But the need for meat is not always predictable , and there will undoubtedly be pressures resulting in the animals being slaugh-tered before the drug has been eliminated . For this reason most developed countries undertake a regular test scheme for drug residues in meat . This is in effect saying to the intensive farmer , We do not trust you ! ' Amazingly , the UK government has admit-ted that in 1990 , 5% ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested were tainted by the antibiotic sulphonamide . the 1940s , some bacteria were identified that had previously been susceptible or sensitive to an antibiotic , but had become resistant to the effects of the drug . Resistance in bacteria to antibiotics does seem inevitable to varying degrees , and it is the amount of drug used that seems to decide how many bacteria become resist-ant ? the greater the use , the more the resistance . Indeed , many experts now consider that some of the use of antibiotics in human medicine is unnecessary , such as for most sore throats , and doc-tors are being encouraged to use antibiotics only when really needed . Many infections are caused by bacteria that inhabit both ani-mals and man , e.g. salmonella , and it is now fairly obvious that if an antibiotic is used in animals , some of the animal 's bacteria may become resistant and those bacteria can then spread to man . This spread can occur by direct contact with the animal , by touch-ing meat , by air , dust , flies , and other insects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in inten-sive rearing can cause difficulties , increased costs and even danger for the treatment of infections in patients . However , proof of this is difficult to come by , and the makers of the antibiotics in animals do have a good defence : they claim that most resistance in human bacteria is due to the high and sometimes unnecessary use of antibiotics in man . However , whilst the exact amount that antibiotic use in animals contributes to resistant bacteria in human infections can not be quantified , surely all agree that the reduced use of antibiotics in food animals and birds would be a laudable aim ? This will be difficult to achieve , for two reasons . The first is that intensive rearing , by definition , must inevitably pack the birds or animals close together , which results in the easy transfer of bacteria and viruses between individuals , either through direct contact or in the very short journey through the air . One animal might contaminate the drinking water or feed and so transfer the infection to others . We know that in human populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are to suffer from epidemics of infections spread in the air , mainly infecting the lung . What this means is that intensive rearing itself must inevitably // Clenbutarol Clenbutarol is a drug that has been used illegally in several European countries and its presence has been detected in many samples of beef . The drug is known colloquially as Angels ' Dust , and a secret organisation for its distribution and use has centred on Holland , France , the UK , and Ireland . The drug has been imported in bulk from South America and distributed by using falsely labelled medicinal containers . Farmers have sprinkled it on cattle feed and the effect is to convert some of the animal 's fat tissues to lean meat . The value of the carcass at slaughter increases ? indeed , it may rescue an effectively non-saleable commodity . There is evidence of serious illness induced by the drug in cattle and the potential for damage to human health is considerable . The drug is known as a beta-agonist and has powerful effects on the lungs , heart and circulation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for treating high blood pressure or irregularities of the heart . Such drugs are called beta-blockers . It is certainly possible that the eating of meat containing even small amounts of Clenbutarol could result in serious symptoms , or even sudden death in these patients . It is gratifying that the Irish Government is taking firm action to try and stamp out this illegal practice . The Clenbutarol issue has shown that intensive rearing of animals and birds is easily exploitable by illegal operations for short-term financial gain . It is not intended to imply that this practice is at present widespread . Indeed , the majority of farmers must be behaving within the law . The problem for the consumer is that he or she is unable to identify the particular origin of most meat available , even that which has not been subjected to processing . Incidentally , it is this same drug that was used by some athletes in the 1992 Olympics to increase the bulk of human muscle . // Blue ear pig disease Blue ear disease in pigs is a type of influenza and its occurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are badly affected so that oxygen can not get into the animal 's blood . This makes the blood look bluish , particularly in the ears . The recent epidemic in Europe began in November 1990 in Germany and has spread westwards , with hundreds of thousands of pigs recently infected . Human influenza spreads similarly . Every 10 years or so , a new type of the virus spreads among the human population , beginning in the Far East and then travelling west . Hong Kong ' flu was a typical example . It is thought that these waves of the human disease originate in pigs in the Far East and Central Asia . Much research has been performed explaining exactly how the influenza virus keeps changing its properties ; this is known as mutating . The vaccines against human influenza give some protection against the disease in people , but as with all vaccines , they have no effect on other diseases . In 1991 , the researchers in Holland discovered the virus that causes blue ear disease in pigs . They also found that if human influenza vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear disease . This means that pig influenza is very similar to human influenza . But is this important ? The answer to this question is yes , because the disease in pigs has a particular tendency to infect pregnant sows and destroy their piglets . If this occurred in women , there could be a similar problem . Indeed there are examples of other infectious agents causing disasters for both pregnant women and animals . Listeriosis can destroy human babies and also lambs and calves . At the moment , all the features of the blue ear virus are not known , nor is it established whether people have already been infected with it . One major problem is that human influenza strikes mainly in the winter , and there is no way of telling how many cases of the disease in Holland and Germany were due to a human or the pig source . So no relevant research has been performed studying the transfer of the infection from pigs to people . It is certainly possible that some people might have been // infected , perhaps without showing obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . Were pregnant women to be vulnerable , the effects would be unpredictable . At best the blue ear virus would not damage the baby ; at worst it could produce birth defects , as can german measles . It must be common sense for pregnant women to avoid contact with live pigs from infected herds . This advice is described as scaremongering ' by the pig industry . But may I remind the pig farmers that it is their method of intensive rearing that was the cause of the virus spreading so rapidly amongst pigs . The battery egg It is probably the revelation as to how most of our eggs were laid that disturbed people most , regarding animal welfare over the last few years in the UK . The battery system does represent the ultimate approach to efficient food production all over the world , and has been developed seemingly regardless of any real consideration for the welfare of the birds . One wonders why organisations dedicated to animal and bird welfare have in the past not been more active in criticising the system . Maybe our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell is usually smooth and regular , with no sign of droppings , feathers , cracks or damage : a perfect food package . Also , the egg is usually fresh in the real sense of the word . Some egg producers can actually ensure delivery to retailers within 24 hours of the egg being laid . Freshness is appreciated by the consumer as a firm and uniform-textured albumen ( or white ) , the yolk sits up proudly in the frying pan and the golden-orange hue reminds us of the sun . Most of the egg delivery lorries will describe the battery sheds as a farm . On them will be painted delightful 19th century rural pictures of chickens scratching around in meadows , the surrounding oak trees casting shadows from the golden sunset . The packing station boxes will usually reinforce this idyllic illusion . The consumer may not appreciate , nor want to know why , on trips deep into the country on holidays , he or she sees // no hens in the field , and may not be curious as to what is going on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then nutritionists say , correctly , that egg albumin is an excellent source of protein ; and whilst the consumer may have heard that high amounts of cholesterol are present in the yolk , there is so much confusion over cholesterol , no-one believes the experts anyway ; and surely , if it comes from a farm , then it must be healthy . Then , finally , there is the price . Eggs are cheap , several-fold less than the equivalent price in 1950 , and of course they are always available , every day of the year . Is not the modern egg the answer to the consumers ' prayers ? Surely it is better than the expensive , dirty , damaged offering , often in short supply , from the bad old days ? What actually goes on in the battery egg system ? Over the last 40 years , chickens that lay battery eggs have been carefully bred to lay continuously ( i.e. nearly daily ) for about a year ; the eggs will be a large and uniform size , and the chicken will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg . Amongst the layers , the problems of diseases are controlled essentially by drugs and vaccines , and disturbed social behaviour such as pecking at neighbours is managed by clipping off the beaks . The female breeding or elite ' hens are provided with adequate cockerels to lay fertile eggs . On hatching , these represent grandparent ' stock and are regularly sold to breed parents ' . It is from these parents that fertilised eggs are transferred to the hatcheries and after incubation , the day-old chicks emerge . Hatching day-old chicks in isolation from their mother ( or even father ) provides the most efficient form of breeding ; but there is a problem . Most newborn birds or mammals become colonised by beneficial bacteria from their mother shortly after birth . These bacteria persist for the whole of the animal 's life and their main value is to keep possibly dangerous germs at bay , simply by their sheer numbers . This does , of course , happen with human babies : the baby in the mother 's womb will contain no bacteria , but // shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria from her skin , birth canal , mouth and so on . But not the newly hatched chick ? there is no mother in attendance . This absence of the normal bacteria from the mother hen is thought to be one of the reasons why salmonella is such a problem in poultry . Research has shown that if these normal or helpful bacteria are given to the day-old chick , it will resist salmonella . Because salmonella may be on the membranes covering the chick as it hatches , the day-old chick may well become invaded by salmonella , and even die ; but more often it recovers subsequently , with the salmonella still living in its internal organs , later to infect eggs or contaminate broiler meat at the time of slaughter . When day-old chicks hatch it is easy to distinguish the males from the females . The males are usually killed by gassing , and their corpses carried by conveyor belt to a type of reprocessing unit , so their remains can be used as feed . The owners of the larger broiler/egg laying units claim nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a few males do survive by accident , and are subsequently weeded out ) , having been delivered as day-old chicks although they may be somewhat older than this in practice , are then reared intensively , usually on the floor of sheds . They are transferred to the broiler cages at the point of laying , say at 18 weeks of age . A typical cage for five hens measures 18 in. x 20 in. ( 45 cm x 50 cm ) . There is a supply of piped water and meal , so the chickens are fed ad libitum . The cages are stacked in rows of about 3 ? 12 and in long lines , with a large broiler house harbouring many thousands of chickens . The floor of each cage consists of a wire network and slopes slightly so that eggs after laying roll gently into a trough away from potential danger from the feet and the droppings . This trough can be static with eggs collected manually , or it can be part of a moving conveyer belt . Droppings fall through the wire mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed is usually controlled for temperature and humidity . Lights are automatically switched on and off cyclically to mimic night and day , but of // course the chicken has no notion of seasons : if it were to believe that summer was approaching , it might stop laying ! The major problem in the battery is of chickens pecking one another ? not surprising , as this is just about all the entertainment that is on offer . So the typical battery chicken has scruffy looking plumage , it may have some completely bare skin , it may bleed and its behaviour can become so aggressive that bones are broken and it dies . On a daily basis each large house will have each cage inspected and any corpse removed . After about a year , the chicken tends to lay fewer and sometimes misshapen eggs . The crop is slaughtered and the miserable carcasses used for processed chicken products , such as soups , pies , pet food and burgers ' . Let us return to the eggs . These will either be packed on site or transported to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and using light to illuminate the egg 's centre . Defective eggs are still used , for example in the cake industry , or for making dried egg powder . Nothing is wasted . The remaining eggs are graded according to size , and packed into containers with dates indicating recommended maximum times of storage . One final point about the colour of the egg yolk . Much of the golden-orange colour is produced by putting suitable dyes with the chicken feed , in the same way as farmed salmon are pinked by dye in the feed ( see Chapter 4 ) . The benefit of the battery system to the egg The traditional bad egg is on the way out and the battery system is partly responsible . By the bad egg , I refer to eggs which are obviously discoloured , brownish , grey , green , black or even pink . The yolk and white merge into one another and the sulphurous stench is ghastly . These effects are due to bacteria gaining entry to the inside of the egg through contamination of the shell surface with droppings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell through water or cracks , usually with rupture or penetration of the membranes between the inside of the shell and the albumen . This // can be caused by accidents on the ground or the hen treading on the egg . The battery system permits the egg to roll out of harm 's way soon after the egg is laid . In conclusion , the genuine and properly husbanded free-range system must surely be the preferred type and surely eggs are so cheap that the moderate additional premium is justified , notwithstanding the rare bad egg ! 4 Salmon and polyunsaturated fats Salmon in the wild Wild salmon are handsome , biologically important and in many aspects unique among fish , inhabiting alternately the sea and fresh water . Until recently , to eat salmon was an expensive luxury . Smoked salmon , caviar and champagne were for the very rich or for very special occasions ! Because salmon in the wild move between fresh ( or river ) water and the sea , their natural habitat in the sea is relatively near land . The Atlantic salmon is found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin , they are found from sea areas adjacent to Northern Russia to the French and Spanish border , and also around Iceland and Greenland . Along the western waters of the Atlantic , they flourish from Hudson Bay in Canada to Cape Cod off Massachusetts in the USA . The Pacific species are distinctive and in general found in sea water not too far away from land in northern latitudes . The life cycle and feeding habits are complicated but they do account for the distinctive nutritional content of the mature wild fish . The young salmon hatch from fertilised eggs laid on the stony beds of rivers : in the UK these are mainly in Wales , Scotland and Ireland . After hatching the tiny fish keeps with it a bag of nutrients from the egg . This is called the yolk sac and is attached to the under or ventral part of the fish . The yolk sac // provides enough nutrients for the baby salmon to establish other sources of food in the river . When the fish are 7 cm long , they are referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will now be 2 years old , silver-coloured and ready for their excursion down river to the sea . The early growth of the salmon can be slower than this , and in cold water some may not be large enough for their sea migration until 5 years old . In the sea , the salmon feed on small organisms , which themselves have fed on even smaller organisms and so on . Much of marine life is ultimately derived from the tiny phytoplankton , and it is from their ability to synthesise substances such as polyunsaturated fats that these and the pink colours become concentrated in the now rapidly growing salmon . Research has shown that one factor favouring these desirable or even essential fats ( i.e. we can not live without them for long ) is a relatively cold environment . After 2 ? 3 years in the sea the salmon are now mature and the males and females return ? quite incredibly ? to the upper reaches of the same rivers from which they hatched . Some theories suggest that salmon recognise their ' river through smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evidence that if the mouth of the river is polluted by , for example , farmed salmon , or is muddy , then the salmon may become confused and fail to find their breeding grounds . Whatever the mechanism , it is a truly amazing and biologically important phenomenon . As the salmon move upstream , they tend to live off their fat stores , rather than attempt any serious eating . Whilst it was fairly easy for the small parr or smolts to swim downstream with the current , the larger adult salmon has a very much tougher assignment , particularly where the river cascades down over boulders . So the salmon jumps , using its welldeveloped tail muscles to generate violent movements of its fins which propel its body up through the water and even out of it altogether through the air . Unfortunately for the salmon , this makes it very conspicuous to the fisherman ! The salmon breed in fairly shallow but free-flowing water over gravelly ground . After an initial courting ritual between the larger // male and the female , it is the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of her tail fin . She then lays the eggs in the hole , the male fertilises the eggs and it is the female once again responsible for filling in the hole with gravel . After this activity the salmon are exhausted and begin to swim downstream , where they are a fairly easy prey for man . However , some do reach the sea once more and then return and breed in subsequent years . It is obviously preferable , therefore , for the survival of the species , that adult salmon are caught on their journey downstream back to the sea , rather than upstream to breed , and the silver smolts spared completely . The nutrients of wild salmon and other fish The pink flesh of wild salmon is composed mainly of protein , as are the muscles of all organisms . It would seem that because of their singular determination to migrate upstream to their breeding ground , their muscles have to be so well developed . There is overall rather little total fat , and certainly almost no saturated fat in wild salmon . Typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What fat there is , tends to be a particular type of polyunsaturated , known as n-3 , ultimately derived from the plankton in the sea . The realisation of the importance of these fatty acids came from the study of Eskimos in Greenland , 15 years or more ago . Eskimos very rarely suffer from heart attacks because their arteries do not tend to accumulate cholesterol deposits and clots . The freedom from these was in turn attributed to large amounts of n-3 fats in their cold , fishy diet . There is also evidence that n-3 fatty acids are desirable for human brain development . Fish oils are thought to be beneficial in preventing or treating a host of other diseases , including arthritis , eczema , psoriasis , disorders of immunity and even cancer . In wild salmon , it is their diet of natural sea organisms , coupled with their active movements and the low temperatures of their environment , that produce such a remarkable food . // Farming of salmon Artificial farming of salmon has been undertaken in Scotland , Ireland and Norway for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , environmental concerns and now doubts over nutrients and the safety of the product . In addition to salmon , the farming of trout is well established , and other species are now going through the experimental stages , such as halibut . Farmed salmon is , however , the major industry and has been most studied . To farm salmon artificially , it is necessary to re-create the conditions suitable for its development . This means that the majority of growth must occur in sea water , which explains why the holding nets are located in sea lochs or are in inlets artificially constructed from the sea . For success the temperature of the water must be on the cool side . But before entering the sea nets , the salmon must be reared in fresh water , and the whole process is performed in a series of large tanks or growing chambers , beginning with artificial fertilisation of eggs from breeding salmon . As the fish grow from parr to smolts , so they are transferred between tanks , there being a flourishing trade in these little fish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed ; the other is the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with a very high density of growing fish . Entire batches of young fish can be lost because of disease . When the growing salmon are transferred to their sea environment , they are checked for disease , but still many problems continue . What are the growing salmon fed with ? It is impossible to recreate the natural sea diet , but attempts to get as near as possible to this have been made . A common source of feed is small fish from the Norwegian Sea , in powdered form . But other products can be used and the farmed salmon have a voracious appetite and will take to a huge variety of feed given to them . One salmon farmer told me that his last batch of feed had some chicken feathers in it ! I 'll leave the implications of this to your imagination . Even recommended feeds can contain 10% beef liver or 25% cereals . // Pinking farmed salmon Readers will be aware that many sea creatures ? shrimps , crabs and lobsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to natural dyes in the tiny creatures on which they feed . Wild salmon is also pink . But farmed salmon are pink only because an orangepink dye is incorporated into their feed . Without this , the colour would be anything from off-white to dirty grey . Colour provides important expectation when eating food , and there is evidence that colour plays a major role in influencing whether animals or birds eat a particular type of food . This is partly hereditary or instinctive , and partly as a result of learning . In practice , then , the consumer would not accept white or grey salmon , hence the need for incorporation of a dye in the feed . Until recently , the dye mainly used was a synthetic substance called canthaxanthin . It is similar in chemical structure to Vitamin A. The group of these chemicals is referred to as retinoids , and it is necessary to discuss them a little further . Vitamin A itself has been known for decades to be essential for several body functions such as seeing at night . In order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as margarine must contain the added vitamin : they are then said to be fortified . Incidentally , the orange colour of carrots is due to a substance called carotene , some of which is converted in the body to Vitamin A. It had been thought that the effect of Vitamin A was entirely beneficial , but there is now evidence that eating too much of this vitamin or some related chemicals can be dangerous . The main effects have been shown to be in pregnant animals ; in humans this can result in birth of offspring with deformities of the face such as harelip and cleft palate . Indeed , the British government in 1990 issued a warning to pregnant women not to eat liver . This was quite unprecedented because liver had always been thought to be an excellent source of vitamins , such as folic acid , Vitamin Biz and Vitamin A. The reason for this warning was that testing had shown dangerous concentrations of Vitamin A in liver . Incidentally , a drug available in the USA and the UK for treat72 Hard to swallow ing severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such is referred to as a retinoid ( meaning relevant to the retina , the back of the eye ) . Female patients treated with this drug are advised that they must not become pregnant . By 1990 , the problem with canthanxanthin was becoming obvious . It was a retinoid too ; so what was the safe amount to eat ? No-one knew ! In particular , virtually no experiments had been done in experimental animals , and in any case would those results be relevant to dangers in people ? Again , no-one knew ! In practice , it is impossible to test safety adequately for such a chemical over a short period , such as 2 years . Another problem became apparent in 1990 . Canthaxanthin had not been cleared in the UK as a colourant to be added to food directly , but it was being used ? apparently legally ? as an additive to the feed of laying chickens to darken the colour of egg yolks , and also as a feed additive for salmon . So a difficult dilemma had developed for the British Ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made more acute when it was publicised that two of its scientific advisory committees recommended ? quite logically ? cessation of use of canthaxanthin in feeds . But what did MAFF do ? Did they ban canthaxanthin ? No , they did not . In a move that can only be described as brilliant ( tactically ) , because Norway was also using the dye , MAFF referred the general matter to the European Commission . Meanwhile , the salmon farmers were encouraged ( but not forced ) to replace canthaxanthin with astaxanthin , a similar but natural dye . There are many people who wish to identify the source of the salmon , as to whether it is wild or farmed . Much of the salmon sold in the UK is labelled simply Scottish salmon ' , which is presumably farmed . The colour is a good guide . The farmed salmon has often been fed too much of the colourant so that it is too dark an orange-pink colour . Wild salmon , such as Pacific , tends to be a paler mid-pink , or just orange-tinted. // Drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmed salmon concerns the use of drugs in its rearing . As with intensively reared poultry or mammals , their high density encourages the rapid spread of diseases . These include bacterial and fungal infections and insect infestations . Drugs are available for treatment , and these are usually well researched and authorised by a veterinary surgeon . But the problems of drug use are greater than with , say , poultry . How do you prevent the drug spreading in the water and damaging marine life on the sea floor ? The fish needing treatment can be transferred to a chamber to be treated with the drug being put in the water , and then returned to the confines of the net within the sea . But the drug might then leach out of the fish and damage the environment . This means of drug delivery is expensive , particularly when many treatments are needed . Alternatively , the drug is sprayed on the top of the water over the mass of wriggling fish in the hope that an adequate amount will get into the fish . It seems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drug is inevitable . One antibiotic often used for treating bacterial infections is tetracycline , and there had been well-documented reports of salmon at the point of sale being contaminated with this antibiotic . // Fortunately the published concentrations seem too low to damage health , but it is quite possible for this antibiotic to accumulate to high amounts in nearby wildlife . Were high concentrations to be eaten by the consumer , the dangerous effects could include damage to the kidneys in the elderly , and disorders of bones and teeth in developing babies and small children . Fortunately , at least so far , the concentrations reported have been insufficient to cause these problems . It is sea lice that cause most havoc with farmed salmon . ( Wild salmon seem much less vulnerable . ) The sea louse burrows into the skin leaving tracks and holes , particularly on the back and on the fins . Whilst the distress to the salmon is considerable , the commercial effect is disastrous . Consumers will not purchase obviously disfigured fish . Over the years concerns over the persistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those drugs that tend not to persist for long in soil or water . The chemicals now in widest use are called organophosphorous compounds . For example , they are incorporated in solvents or shampoos for the treatment of head lice in people . They kill insects after contact through paralysis and they can , if absorbed in people , be dangerous to the point where they can produce immediate death or , if a person is exposed for weeks , a chronic disease of confusion , shaking , weakness or tiredness . For serious side effects to occur the drug would either require to be eaten or applied to a very large part of the body surface . The only effective compound used for delousing farmed salmon is one of these organophosphorous drugs , known as dichlorvos . The drug is added to the water at intervals , and the lice are killed by it . It certainly does work . However , the salmon can become re-infected and several applications of dichlorvos may be needed . Occasionally a salmon will absorb excessive amounts of the drug ? so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but whilst the interval between the last use of the drug and the retailing of the fish should be sufficient for the drug to have disappeared from the fish , this is not always the case . Salmon in one supermarket have been tested and found to contain dichlorvos . HowSalmon // ever , the more serious side effects of dichlorvos occur in people handling the drug , who could accidentally absorb amounts sufficient to be very dangerous . There are reports of actual deaths in people associated with using organophosphorous compounds . The effect on the other marine life has also been shown to be damaging . Whilst dichlorvos persists for shorter periods than older insecticides , its rate of decomposition varies with the temperature and acidity of water , and cold sea water does permit the drug to survive for days or even weeks in sufficiently high concentration to kill many marine organisms . Sea deserts ' have been described near salmon farms . Incidentally , the pink dye from the feed can also escape , and then animals that survive dichlorvos can turn bright orange-pink ! The list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avidly eating conglomeration of fish produces an enormous amount of excrement , which drops to the sea or loch floor . There , further chemicals are produced by decomposition with damage to marine life . The impact of this can be lessened by movement of the farm at regular intervals , but this adds to the cost and it is arguable that this might just spread the poisons more widely . Another environmental concern is the possible effect on wild salmon . Here there is no formal proof , but a very high degree of suspicion . Articles on fishing and conservation during the last few years have pointed to a reduction in the numbers of wild salmon inhabiting rivers . The opposite trend might have been expected since salmon farming , through producing an abundance of cheap salmon , should have reduced the commercial pressures on the costly and unpredictable wild salmon trade . There are many salmon fishers and environmental commentators who believe that farmed salmon have directly been responsible for the loss of wild salmon stocks . The argument goes as follows . The method of rearing farmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial environment and not suitable for wild habitation . It has been selected to put on weight rapidly ; and it will not need natural conditions to breed and continue the species : this is organised by man . The farmed salmon , because of its life under high population density , will often be diseased . // Some inevitably escape during transfer procedures or through damaged nets . These diseased escapees ' may pass on to the wild salmon their infections and infestations and may also interbreed , producing offspring unsuited to the wild habitats . Furthermore , some farmed salmon are sterile . Certainly , the case that farmed salmon damage wild salmon is not proven . But the worry is very real , and many conservationists are deeply concerned about the expansion of the farmed salmon industry . There are also concerns that the general damage to the environment caused by salmon farming will also damage wild salmon . Industrial pollution entering the rivers may be a factor in reducing salmon numbers , and if salmon farms were located adjacent to the river mouths , this would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that overfishing has been responsible for the decline in numbers . This could occur through unauthorised fishing in the rivers ( or poaching ' ) , or by excessive netting out at sea before the salmon return to their rivers . Certainly , new regulations have been introduced that are aimed to reduce widespread commercial poaching . But none of the problems seem essentially novel , and the question marks remain over farming as a cause of the demise of the wild salmon . Fats of farmed salmon The first clue that something may be amiss with the fats of farmed salmon is the observation that compared with the wild fish , the farmed variety is more likely to suffer from disease of the arteries and heart . The most obvious difference between the fats of wild and farmed salmon is in the total fat present . That in farmed salmon is typically 4 ? 6% of total weight , that in wild is 2.5 ? 3% . The farmed fish does look more oily and the differences between the light and dark striations of the flesh seem more marked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring out the grain ! The other changes concern the relative properties amongst the // fatty acids . Farmed salmon has much less of the desirable n-3 and more of the less useful n-6 than wild salmon . The question now is , should nutritionists enthuse over the desirability of farmed salmon as ideal food ? It is not clear at all , and the realisation that farmed fish fats have changed for the worse has raised more questions over other intensively reared birds and mammals ( see below ) . Smoked salmon Smoked salmon used to be the height of luxury ; thin slices with brown bread and lemon . Wonderful . Now the glamour is going from farmed salmon . There is yet another problem . Smoked salmon is cold-smoked . A commonly used system is to burn oakwood shavings with just enough air to keep the smouldering going but not to permit them to burst into flames . The smoke is carried through ducts to chambers holding trays of raw half-salmon cuts . The volatile and aromatic substances from the wood will permeate into the flesh of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salmon will become warm , but not hot , and the substances from the wood may not exert much effect on bacteria . You may be beginning to sense the problem : this type of cold-smoking results in a final product that is essentially raw and has been kept warm for hours . Now , if meticulous care is taken over the whole process , then it may be safe , but the problem develops from the initial farming method , that is likely to encourage bacterial contamination in the first place . This may be initially confined to the outside surface of the fish , but de-gutting and halving the flesh are likely to spread any contaminating bacteria over most of the surfaces . Two consequences of this have already occurred . First , the American FDA now regularly tests imported smoked salmon , and some batches from the UK have been rejected on account of the presence of listeria ( see Chapter 9 ) . Secondly , attempts have been made to outlaw the practice of sending smoked salmon by post in the UK. // It is interesting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any person resulting from eating smoked salmon . One wonders whether the discrete smoking of wild salmon would have provided such dangers , or indeed would have provoked such responses as have occurred to the mass production of a potentially dangerous food item . In conclusion , the rapid expansion of intensive farming of salmon produces worries comparable to the problems associated with terrestrial systems : these include concerns of safety , the quality of nutrients of the food produced , and the high cost to the environment . It is true that farmed salmon on the whole looks and tastes like the genuine product and is of course cheap and is available throughout the year . But the price paid in other ways is very high . Intensive rearing and polyunsaturated fats The realisation that farming salmon does adversely affect the nature of its fats , raises questions over fats in intensively reared animals and poultry in general . I will first try and explain the types of fat present in food . They are generally present in two forms . One is the visible deposits of white or yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids and glycerol . The other type is invisible , and found in all vegetable and animal cells , with the fatty acid linked to proteins . Unprocessed lean meat necessarily contains a moderately high proportion of fat as do nuts and avocado pears . Most fatty acids in the adipose tissue ( and hence fatty meat ) of ruminants ? cattle and sheep ? are saturated . Stearic acid is the most prevalent . This molecule contains a long line of carbon atoms and all the possible sites for hydrogen atoms to be attached to the carbon chain are occupied . It is said to be saturated , because no more hydrogen can be added . Its formula is CH3(CH2)16COOH , simplified to C181-136O2 ? This fatty acid tends to be solid at ordinary temperatures and is very insoluble in water . Suppose the long carbon chain is two hydrogen atoms short . // This dramatically alters the properties of the fat , now a monounsaturated fat . The formula is now C81-134O2 , apparently very similar to stearic acid . But the new chemical compound has a kink in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it mixes more easily with water . Indeed , the chemical is well known : it is oleic acid , the main ingredient of olive oil . Oleic acid is found in many ( probably all ) mammals ' milk . Completely lean meat is also rich in oleic acid and some other mono-unsaturated fatty acids . We lose two more hydrogen atoms , to make C18H3202 or linoleic acid , which is found in many vegetable oils such as sunflower oil . This is a polyunsaturated fat . To lose two more hydrogens we produce Cl8H3002 or linolenic acid , found in more vegetable oils , taking the name from linseed oil . This , too , is a polyunsaturated fat ; as hydrogen is lost , so the molecule develops more kinks and the fat is easier for the body to use . Indeed , a certain amount of polyunsaturated fats is essential . The problem is that animals do not make these to any extent ; it is only plant life , either in the sea or on land , that produces these , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of polyunsaturated fats , we can either eat plant material directly or we can eat meat or fish that contains these as a result of their eating plant life . We have already seen that wild salmon have considerable amounts of their desirable n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids . The reason we are going into these details here is that the type of rearing of all sorts of food mammals and birds alters their type of fat , with a general deterioration in value of these essential nutrients as the rearing conditions become more intensive . Catfle Twenty-five years ago , Dr M. A. Crawford showed that the total weight of fat in wild buffalo ( American bison , a ruminant ) was 2.8% whereas that of beef in the butchers was 25% . Only 2.2% of the beef fat was polyunsaturated , compared with 20% of the buffalo fat . Moreover , the more active the buffalo , the greater // was its proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids to others ( is this the scientific basis for jogging and sport as a whole ? ) . Efforts have been made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If cows are fed with supplements of soya oil , the amount of oleic acid in the milk increases . But attempts to alter the invisible fats in meats , by feeding cattle sunflower oil , have been less successful . The main problem is that the animal 's rumen has developed to make grass and other sources of cellulose digestible . There , bacteria break the big indigestible pieces of cellulose into small pieces which are then absorbed and used for various purposes in the animal 's body . This also happens to sunflower oil , but the small pieces are not then reassembled into polyunsaturated fats . Many of the pieces are lost into the atmosphere as the gas methane . One interesting finding from Japan is that when cattle were fed concentrates ( mainly the protein-rich meal from rendering plants ) , whilst putting on more weight , and therefore of greater commercial value , there was a reduction in desirable fatty acids in the meat . Pigs , broilers With both pigs and chickens , the nature of the fats in the feed also has a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If pigs are fed supplements of sunflower oil , the fat in the meat becomes less saturated . Unfortunately , the more hydrogen atoms taken away from the fatty acid , the more it tends to be decom-posed during storage , by oxygen in the air reacting at its weak links . This means that pork from pigs fed on oils can develop unpleasant smells or flavours . We will return to this general issue in Chapter 5 , but suffice it to say now that the more complicated the food chain gets , and the longer the product has to survive in an acceptable form , the less desirable are polyunsaturates to the processor ! The same arguments apply very much to broilers , where the // composition of the animal 's fat is influenced by its diet . Free-range chickens will tend to contain better fats than those inten-sively reared , for several reasons . One is that they have access to vegetation . The second is that their activity will tend to burn up ' some of the saturated fat and thirdly , the temperature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the artificial feeds associ-ated with maximum weight gain are based on stored powdered cereals and protein concentrates . When fed these , the weight gain is remarkable , but the quality of the meat poor in terms of its fatty acids . The problem for the consumer is that salmon , poultry and red meat look very much the same regardless of the differ-ences in the types of invisible fat . The argument that it is preferable for us to eat directly the vegetable food , rather than give it to intensively reared animals , is beginning to make strong economical , nutritional and environ-mental sense ; quite apart , that is , from grounds of animal welfare . // 1 I have just learnt from reliable sources of the following incident during the summer of 1992 . A salmon farm net enclosure in Loch Feochan , near Oban , Scotland , held about 20 tons of salmon ; these were adult fish of both sexes , although many of the males would have been sterile , and so incapable of breeding . An accident occurred with a motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 tons of salmon escaped . During the next few weeks , witnesses observed a much greater than expected migration of salmon up the adjacent rivers . Comment These escapees ' must be expected to damage the wild salmon stock , for a number of reasons . They will compete for food , space and breeding grounds , and if they were to interbreed with the // wild salmon , some of their genes would be likely to reduce the vigour of the resultant fish . 2 The EC is now proposing to ban canthaxanthin in the feed of mammals , birds and fish , but still permit it as an additive to foods directly ! Zoo owners are now concerned that their flamingoes will not pink up ' because of this ban ! 5 Dried food Introduction Drying is the oldest means of storing food , making it usable during seasons or at times outside its normal availability . Undoubtedly , man 's ability to store food has been central to his global domination . The reason that removing water from food preserves it is that bacteria , the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as spoilage ) , do need adequate water to start to grow at all . Drying will actually kill some bacteria , but often not reliably or completely . Many bacteria can change themselves into tiny hard spheres ( technically called spores ) as the amount of water present is reduced . The spores can not produce disease in this form , but if the dried food is moistened and then kept wet , these spores can revert back to their earlier growing forms and be capable of either spoiling the food , or even causing illness . This means that dried food will often contain many bacteria , but it is still safe , as long as it is eaten soon after rehydration . This is well illustrated with dried gravy powders that may contain as many as 100,000 bacteria per gram , but they are in a harmless , dormant state , and if eaten in this state , they are easily digested and destroyed by our enzymes in the gut . The danger comes from keeping the reconstituted gravy for too long and too warm . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from their dormant state and start growing , so one of the golden rules of food safety is that left-overs of gravies and similar products should he discarded after the meal , and not kept for the next . In // // tradition of exposing pieces of lamb to the air and wind is still to be seen on some of the Scottish islands . Then some foods are inevitably dried as a result of heat used in the manufacturing process . Biscuits ( cookies ) and crisps ( chips ) are examples . It has long been recognised that where food is dried slowly some problems do develop . Bacteria can have sufficient time to grow to produce toxins , nutrients such as vitamins and fats decompose , and the texture or feel of the food can also be spoilt . Some of the flavours and smells of food are due to substances that tend to be lost through evaporation during drying . And the slower the drying , the more these volatile chemicals tend to be lost . So rapid and complete drying out of food has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed through a process called freeze-drying . The food is first fast-frozen so that any water is rapidly converted to fine ice crystals . Then these are evaporated off under a vacuum and immediately the product is placed into jars , cans or packets that are sealed to ensure no penetration of air and its inevitable moisture . Freeze-drying is used for instant coffee and tea , dried milk , gravy and soup powders . The storage life can be very long ? up to several years ? as long as the seal is kept intact . Most bacteria survive this process , but are obviously immobile and inert in the dry powder . This method certainly does hold some of the product 's flavour better than other slower types of drying , but even so , flavour is lost and this accounts for the differences between powdered coffee and real ' coffee . However , with soups the flavour loss may be greater than with coffee ; so the flavour enhancer monosodium glutamate and other artificial chemicals may be added to boost the taste . The result is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , of course , numerous chemical additives . Also , the drying process might cause loss of colours , and these may need to be replaced . Sometimes other chemicals are needed to prevent the powder forming into lumps . It has been suggested that dried food is generally safe as regards bacterial contamination . This is not quite true : a few practice this means that we should make up only the amount of gravy required for the meal concerned . How dry must food become for it to be preserved ? Surprisingly , quite a large amount of water can still be present in food that appears dry . Butter contains around 18% water , potato crisps ( chips ) and biscuits ( cookies ) , say 5 ? 15% . Some food is dried naturally . The seeds ripening on plants contain little water ; this enables the seed to survive in inclement environments prior to its deposit on suitably moist and fertile ground to germinate . Nuts , cereals , and peas and beans ( pulses ) after harvesting are therefore inherently safe . The problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain microorganisms to grow on the surfaces of these crops . The air contains tiny invisible particles of fungi , like bacterial spores , harmless to us in that state . But if the fungi alight on the moist outside coat of seeds , such as nuts , they can begin to grow , penetrating a network of minute and mainly invisible hairs into the seed . Fungi often grow in somewhat drier conditions than bacteria ; one well-known problem concerns peanuts . If peanuts are stored in warm , moist air , a fungus can grow and produce a chemical called aflatoxin . If these mouldy nuts are eaten , this aflatoxin can be absorbed into the body and cause illness . One effect of this is thought to be the risk of liver cancer . This link has not been formally proved ? and hopefully it never will need to be ? because of the care and control over the movement and sale of such risky products . Dried foods such as nuts and dates are tested regularly for the presence of aflatoxin , and if the amount is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The storage of animal feed powder under warm and moist conditions has also been found to favour aflatoxin formation , and one use of irradiation has been to remove this fungal contami-nation . Unfortunately , irradiation will not eliminate aflatoxin already in the feed , so this use , like the others , remains contro-versial ( see Chapter 7 ) . There are a number of ways of drying food . The simple exposure of food to the elements has been used from ancient times , and is still used for some fruit and meat . The // problems have occurred , but these must be rare compared with those of moist processed food . Batches of pasta have become contaminated with a bacterium called Staphylococcus aureus , which might cause problems after the pasta was rehydrated , and salmonella has very rarely been found in powdered milk . The problem here was that the bacteria were introduced into the food before it was dried , and subsequently survived . Chocolate Chocolate is one of the staple luxuries of the developed world . It is not too bad for you nutritionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into endless varieties of shapes , additions and titillations . And it can be stored at room temperature ! Cocoa forms its basis and itself makes a rich drink . The most luxurious sweets are made in Belgium , France and Switzerland . In other countries , the products tend to be more simple and cheaper . I find American and British chocolate a bit boring ! Where does chocolate come from ? The story goes ( and who am I to challenge it ? ) that the ancient Aztecs and Mayas ( remember the Mexican pyramids ) had been putting crushed cocoa beans into water to make a drink called chocolatl . It was usually drunk cold and all manner of spices were added . The magic ' beans were taken back to Spain in 1502 by none other than the marauder Christopher Columbus . From here the drink became sweeter until it reached London in 1657 , with the opening of the first chocolate house in Bishopsgate . Chocolate soon became popular among those who could afford it , and over the years the increasing consumption in Western countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raw product cocoa . It is just possible that in the last few years savoury snacks such as crisps ( or chips ) have knocked chocolate off its pedestal as the World 's No. 1 snack , but accurate figures are not available . Perhaps we have had too much of a good thing ? The natural habitat of the cocoa tree is near the Equator , often not too distant from the coast . West Africa is the principal // producing region of the world , followed by the West Indies and South America . The production of cocoa is labour intensive . The initial tree seedlings require moisture and light , but not the direct sun . The cocoa crop does not appear for several years , and does not reach its maximum for up to 15 years . Oddly the flowers and subsequent fruit sprout directly from the trunk and branches . The cocoa seeds or beans are held in a large reddish-brown pod about 20 cm long and are picked by hand , usually twice each year . The picked pods are allowed to ferment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beans are dried in the sun and can be transported to all parts of the world . When they arrive at their destination , they are cleaned , roasted and crushed , then the small pieces of edible chocolate ( called nibs ) are retained . To make chocolate , the nibs are ground into powder or cut into flakes , usually with the addition of milk products . The slurry is further processed according to the texture needed and poured into moulds to set . The end result contains 2 ? 10% water and should be too dry for bacteria to grow . It is not often realised that salmonella can persist in chocolate . There were several small outbreaks in the 1970s and 1980s in Canada and the USA . The key to understand-ing these accidents is that in the making of chocolate , the tempera-ture can not be too high as it results in the ugly whitening of the product . Exactly how salmonella becomes incorporated into the chocolate is not known , but it could well have been introduced through contamination of several ingredients by human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 245 people in UK suffered from food poisoning due to a particular strain of salmonella , known as Salmonella napoli ( so named after its Italian origin ) . The infection was traced by clever detective work to two types of chocolate bars , Tommy Junior ' and Rocky Junior ' , both made in Italy . What was particularly interesting in this outbreak was the small numbers of salmonella bacteria actu-ally in the chocolate , about 50 ? 100 per bar ; it had previously been thought that hundreds of thousands of salmonella bacteria were needed to cause an infection . Presumably , the salmonellae in the chocolate were protected // by damage from the acid in the person 's stomach after being eaten . They would then pass into the intestines and increase in numbers to produce bellyache and diarrhoea . That small numbers of salmonella in fatty food can cause disease is important in regard to the problem with eggs ( see Chapter 9 ) . But these accidents should be avoidable , and dried foods must overall be safer than moist , preserved products . Enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookies are not quite the same . Although one is a British word , the other American , the British biscuit tends to be flatter and harder ( and sometime duller to eat ) than cookies which can have cake-like aspirations . The methods of manufacture are similar , and I hope American readers will forgive the use of the word biscuit here . Chocolate , we have seen , is largely produced in the Third World and consumed in the developed countries . The food industry is central to this function and the problems resulting from eating moderate amounts of this luxury ( yes , I believe it is a luxury ) are few indeed . Biscuits are in a somewhat different category . With a certain amount of care , most could be made in the home , although a few of the raw ingredients may be difficult to obtain . The commercial biscuit 's success depends not so much on providing availability of a product that would otherwise be impossible to obtain , but on its convenience and also on its low cost . Making small numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateur cook , is laborious and needs considerable fuel energy . The actual cost of the home-made biscuit may be as much , or even more than the retail brand . No wonder supermarket biscuits are so popular and seem to occupy a large part of the shelves ! Incidentally , the occupied space is proportionately greater in the UK than in the USA . Methods of biscuit manufacture are all fairly similar . The principle ingredient is a cereal , mainly wheat , maize , oats or rye . // According to the desired final texture this is ground either to a coarse or to a fine flour , water added , and the thick pastry-like slurry portioned and baked . Crispbreads , apart from a small amount of salt , contain very little else and it is difficult to find any fault at all in most of these ! But the sweeter and shorter-textured biscuits have substantial additional ingredients , principally fat and sugar . The fat is used for shortening ? producing a firm but soft texture ? and the sugar panders to our love of sweetness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on prolonged storage to give a rancid flavour , the ones used often include hydrogenated oils and palm oil . It is these that have been producing doubts for nutritionists and will be discussed later ( see Chapter 15 ) . Biscuits are essentially crisp-textured and their packaging and shelf life are aimed at ensuring that the crispness is retained . The packaging may not be completely airtight , because of cost , but if biscuits are stored in a dryish atmosphere ? with a relative humidity of about 50% ? absorption of water will be slow . Limp biscuits may be disappointing to bite , but they are probably quite safe ! Breakfast cereals Breakfast cereals are one of the other successes of the food industry . Successful because a new form of food has been created that can not be made by the consumer , except with extreme difficulty . Also , because the product is dry , it is safe . Each brand is based on a particular cereal crop that is usually ground , converted into a slurry , shaped and baked as with biscuit manufacture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cereal such as Kellogg 's Cornflakes , Shredded and Puffed Wheat , Weetabix , All-bran , and Grapenuts . Most of these have stood the test of time and remain justifiably popular . Some contained added vitamins and minerals ? not so much because of an awareness by the industry that its processes would destroy these , but more as a sales gimmick . In the early years , such vitamins might have sometimes been helpful in the then meagre diet , but today // there really should not be a problem of vitamin intake ? unless one lives ' on beefburgers ( perish the thought ) ! Seen from a marketing point of view , the addition of a new brand would expand the total amount of breakfast cereals sold , presumably at the expense of bread , eggs and bacon . But ultimately the market had to become saturated , and the competition fought back . Remember the slogan in the UK , Go to work on an egg ' just a few years ago . So the pressure for novelty in cereals has mounted . Some were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed breakfaster the unnecessary hassle of sprinkling the flakes with sugar ! Then the packets contained the outlines of toys that could be assembled by cutting and glueing . Then actual toys were put into the cereal . In order to promote the idea that the cereal was a complete food , almost everything was added : raisins , sultanas , honey , cocoa , and sugar ? always sugar . The manufacturers of the early cereals had acted responsibly over the amount of sugar they added . This is not now always the case . Many are now too sweet . Then the shapes changed . Recognising that not only did children have a sweet tooth , but were naturally aggressive , some of the shapes and toys became quasi-military , often with space exploration ideas . The number of types of cereal available increased further with the supermarkets selling their own brands , copying some of the standard products . You do not know whether these are in reality identical to , say , those made by Kellogg or Quaker , but in different packets , or are cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex and costly , and I suspect that there is more cereal wasted because too many varieties are available and bought . The food industry tells us that the greater the choice , the better off we are . I am not sure about this : surely more choice in a fixed volume market means more cost in manufacture , greater need for storage space , and more stale food ? In conclusion , these old well-known brands are recommended : Kellogg 's Cornflakes and All-bran , Weetabix and Shredded Wheat . We will be returning to the role of cereals in the ideal diet in Chapter 15 . But for the moment , we must recognise the value of // the principle of the breakfast cereal . It is up to you to chose those which are both good ' for you and that you enjoy . Certainly cereals are one of the major successes of the food industry . Well done , Kelloggs . Crisps ( or chips ) It is not exactly certain where and when the first commercial crisps were sold commercially . There is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that initially there were many local products , some of which have been copied by national distributors . Incidentally , we had better understand what we are describing . In the UK , packets of fried thin slices of potato are called crisps . In North America and many other countries , they are called chips . Of course , these products are not based just on potato , maize being commonly used . The range available in a typical supermarket is now daunting . This was not always the case . The author 's memory goes back to the post-war years when just one variety seemed to be available nationally ! Smith 's . The bags did not identify details of the contents , but were presumably slices of potato just fried and the salt ? seemingly a de rigueur requirement ? put in twists of blue paper . Sometimes the bags were punctured and the crisps were soft . Over the years other brands began to compete and then audaciously , some manufacturers sprinkled the salt onto the crisps for you . This was soon to pave the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be short-lived , but others have endured , such as cheese and onion . Those without additional flavours came to be called plain and the exotic tastes of the others were highlighted by packet colours ? beef was brown , tomato sauce red , cheese and onion yellow and green , and salt and vinegar blue or inexplicably , green . From time to time reactions to all these different brands have set in , with the launching of real , traditional or original crisps , unflavoured but complete with salt in the blue paper twist . All sorts of other developments have occurred , too . The potato // has been dried , powdered , or reconstituted into slurry to make square crisps . The amount of fat used has been reduced ( these are called low-fat , but you could argue that they should be called high-starch ) . Now , once the idea that potato crisps or chips could be fashioned from reconstituted potato powder , then doors opened to almost any shape , size , colour or composition . Some are made in the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottomless pit . Then , for the calorie-conscious public , some are aerated so the product is full of healthy bubbles , as are some brands of chocolate . Many types of this packeted snack genre are not based on potato at all . Maize is popular . Or any old starch ? re-fashioned , blown up , dyed , flavoured and sold with all the hype of mass media advertising and packaging . The supermarket crisp shelves are a veritable Aladdin 's cave : a paradise for children . Health freaks can choose types that are low-fat , calorie-reduced , or high-fibre ? potato skins or dried apples . Indeed , the boundaries between crisps and nuts and dried fruit have become blurred . Anything goes . The dried packeted snack rules the Western World ! Well , why not ? Is there anything wrong with crisps or chips ? Not when eaten in moderation , but there are some concerns . The first is that crisps usually contain around 30% fat . This may not be a problem , depending on the type of fat . Take slices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold . No worries here . But suppose these crisps do not sell rapidly , and after a week or so the sunflower oil starts going off ? rancid . Then the crisps will taste and smell off ' or stale . As with cereals , the more varieties there are available for a fixed market volume , then the trend must surely be for each to be stored for longer . So the combination of the ability to manufacture such a variety of snacks , and the hunger of the consumer for them , make the problems of storage very real , space apart . This is why more and more of certain types of oils are being used with the intention that they will enable the product to last for longer before being eaten . It is unfortunate that polyunsaturated fats do tend to decompose more readily than saturated , so the change in the oil // is frequently towards types which are either saturated or chemically treated by hydrogenation to make them last longer . Palm oil is an example of a saturated vegetable oil and is obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formula C16H3202 ? known as palmitic acid . You see the ratio of hydrogen to carbon , like the principal ingredient in mutton fat , is exactly 2:1. // Hydrogenated oils One way to stop polyunsaturated fats from going rancid is to treat them with hydrogen . The end result is known as a hydrogenated oil and many varieties of processed food will list this as an ingredient . It will rarely be listed as an exact amount , as it will be difficult to know exactly how much of the oil has been altered chemically . Hydrogenation is used by the food industry in two ways : one is to make the oil last longer before going off ' and the other is to solidify fluid oil . You may wonder how pure fluid sunflower oil is converted to solid margarine made from pure sunflower oil ' . The answer is through hydrogenation . It is interesting that the use of hydrogenation was developed by the food industry with little research or concern for its effects on us , the consumers . Is there a problem with hydrogenation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fats produced are often unnatural . Chemically , the shape of natural unsaturated fats is such that they are said to be in the cis formation . You may have seen that the main component of sunflower oil is cis , cis linoleic , meaning this fat has two regions of its chemical molecule in the natural shape . When polyunsaturated fatty acids are hydrogenated , about half the resulting chemicals are in the unnatural or trans shape . This may well matter a great deal because experiments have shown that the human body does not seem to handle this unnatural fat as well as the natural . Experiments in Holland were performed on 34 women and 25 men who volunteered to test different diets . Each received identical diets except that 10% of it was varied in the fat supplement . Some received a natural cis unsaturated fat supplement , others the unnatural trans fat and others the saturated fat palmitic acid . Each person , in variable order , ate each of the diet types for 3 weeks , so the experiment lasted 9 weeks . The effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by taking samples of blood at the beginning , and at the end of each of the 3 week periods . With both the saturated fat , palmitic , and the unnatural trans , the blood cholesterol rose . Furthermore , other blood changes occurred when on the unnatural trans diet , that were thought to be unfavourable ' . // These studies suggest , therefore , that people who consume substantial amounts of hydrogenated oils , like saturated fats , are more likely to develop raised cholesterol levels in their blood and so possibly be at greater risk of heart attacks and strokes . Further studies are urgently needed in this area and we should look at more people for longer , in different countries and on different types of diet . As we will be discussing in Chapter 15 , the value of levels of cholesterol in the blood in predicting heart attacks is not simple , although I think there is complete agreement that our diet should not make it go up too much . But surely , the regulatory authorities should , at least until evi dence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial additives and treat them with the same scrutiny as , say , cyclamates or saccharin ? It is a reasonable approach now to try and eat only dry fat foods , such as biscuits or crisps , that contain vegetable oils other than palm oil , and not hydrogenated oil . If such a product has a pleasant taste it is likely to be fresh in the true sense of the word .

We do not actually need to eat bread at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyable . The worst is a routine eating chore performed out of convenience , and of poor food value . We will be looking at the great bread debate later , but first consider the origins of bread . When ancient man first started to grow wheat and other crops for food , he must have already been aware that he could not eat the grains unless they were first ground up . If you do n't believe me , try eating whole wheat or maize grains and they will probably pass straight through your intestines , undigested . This is because the tough outside coverings of the seeds prevent our digestive enzymes from access to the nutrients underneath . Our teeth , we saw in Chapter 1 , evolved mainly to remove the outsides of large fruits , not to crunch whole grains . ( Do n't try to do this , as your teeth may break . ) But birds , such as chickens , have evolved the ability to digest grain . They possess an instinct that makes them peck sharp grit which roughens the outside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside and dissolve the nutrients so that they can be absorbed . Whilst bread or other processed cereals may not be our natural
