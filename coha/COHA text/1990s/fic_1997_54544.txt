High up , in the towers of the public housing project , Laura Providencia and her mother , her brother , Angel , and her little sister , Rosita , lived under siege . In the elevator that smelled like a urinal , the junkies bobbed devotionally . The walls of the long hallways teemed with the exploding alphabet , the declamations , white , screaming , " Paco of St. Ann 's Ave " " Hector El Corazon " " The Bishops , ' the worm-like letters spawning words , the words clamoring over one another , keeping pace with Laura Providencia as she walked down the long hallway toward the vestibule where the mailboxes were plundered . <p> During the first months in the new country , she had longed for letters from her cousins on the island to corroborate what she thought she remembered . She learned the new language quickly and felt all at once like a guest in her own life . Laura 's mother , Senora Milagros , was astonished , and suspected that the rapidity with which her daughter learned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbarous new world . Although , in the new world , shoes were plentiful . Stunned , Senora Milagros looked at the dark girl budding into a woman , the pretty girl mouthing with such facility the noise of the new incomprehensible words , and she forgot the occasion of Laura Providencia 's fourteenth birthday . But Angel , who was one year older than his sister , celebrated his birthday on the same day , and as Senora Milagros remembered her son 's birthday , it seemed to her that Laura had loitered in her womb as a reproach for the passion that had made her . <p> Senora Milagros regaled her neighbor , Senora Ramirez , with the story : she told it tenderly , and Laura knew she was meant to overhear , as God was meant to overhear . " Dios mio , a day and a night in labor , the pain like knives , she came out of my body , tore me to pieces . I was nursing her brother , and she was not supposed to happen ; but she was in me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts . I had to hire my cousin Teresa to nurse Angel . I paid Teresa with my shoes . After a year to the day her brother was born , she came . And then this one , " Senora Milagros said , caught her breath , and braced her back against the couch pillow . She spread the fingers of her large right hand , held and encompassed the top of Rosita 's velvety head . Senora Ramirez said , " Pero , pero , " her hands twitched in her lap , her face disfigured with a disappointment as profound as a child 's , she struggled against the desire to weep , shocked by the audacity that had compelled her to interrupt Senora Milagros . <p> Laura Providencia noticed that the women 's gestures mirrored one another : they sighed in harmony , and breathed in unison , the black-sheathed , swelling cushions of their breasts a rising tide of dark moons obscuring their chins . But they were n't identical , though Laura had seen them that way , except now , the crack , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senora Ramirez 's interrupting " But , but " allowed Laura to see again that her mother 's face was round and brown and Senora Ramirez 's was teak-colored and narrow , but these distinctions did not alter what the two women found in the greater affinity , their one fate . But it was up to Senora Milagros to tell it , this , Senora Ramirez could not do , she was not the talker , it was up to Lucia Milagros to tell the truth of her heart which was their one life , uniting them deeper than blood . Lucia Milagros telling it , and Dolores Ramirez nervously attentive , until finally she was still , and only listening , and at home in her silence . And now in telling it , Senora Milagros had elected to leave out a part , did n't say it  --  without explanation , discarding perhaps , foreshortening maybe . Was this all that was left out of the recitation to be tacitly understood , could such a telling be trusted ? Out of the wreckage of Senora Ramirez 's trance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body paid homage , duplicating every movement and gesture of Senora Milagros 's . <p> Senora Ramirez 's mouth labored , her tongue slowly herring one word at a time , attempting to place each word in a coherent order , and , failing , she held up two fingers . Senora Ramirez nodded . Senora Milagros sighed and nodded and told once more of the two children who had died : one in the womb , that she had known was a boy because her belly had come to a point , and she , who had been pretty , became ugly within a month , which was as long as that son had survived within her ; and Luz Divina , the infant girl deserted by life after only a week on the earth , taken while napping in her little hammock , without cause or reason that God would reveal to the midwife or priest , all fathered by Noel , who appeared almost as regularly as Christmas . Senora Milagros shrugged and was silent . Senora Ramirez searched Senora Milagros 's face for the cause of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep some part of the story for herself ? Senora Ramirez , who would never presume to tell it , offered the names of her living children , Dolores , Rafael , and Venus ( named for the popular song , long before anyone knew that the girl would have the face of a Pekingese dog ) . Senora Ramirez 's face closed as though she were submerging her head beneath water , and for a perfect minute her face became the mask of an enduring Pieta ; saying more would achieve nothing , and her friend , her sister in misfortune , knew and did n't need to be told again . Venus , the adolescent girl with the dog 's face , hated her mother , and she hated her name : the name that clung to her long after the song ceased to be heard from the windows of the housing project , and there was no point in telling Venus that her mother had n't intended the irony that adhered to her name like a chronic illness . Venus looked at her mother and could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puffed out her lips and turned the lobes of her ears red ; the silence she kept as long as she could hold her breath wheezed . She gulped air and did n't name the two children she had lost , but genuflected once for each , let out a howl that burst open her mouth , and called " Julio , Julio " not because she expected the man who had fathered her children to ever appear again , but calling out the provisional name she had given to her loss might prime the recitation Senora Milagros had stunted . " Julio , Julio , mi vida , " she called . <p> Senora Milagros said , " Entonces , well , Noel was merely useless as other men , he could never understand why any more should be required of him except to be handsome and in love , although he aspired to be dangerous , but was only brutal in manly commonplace ways . Luz Divina who lived only a week was the most beautiful of my children , her face a sublime version of her father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the six years of mourning , Noel 's long absences and brief visitations began : during the rare visitations he claimed his husbandly rights . More memorable than Noel 's appearances were the soups that my sister Titi prepared and fed me , deepening my sleep . One scalding afternoon , after the hot bath my sister prescribed , and a bowl of her steaming soup , which had the head of a whiskered fish in it , but smelled of jasmine , and had the taste of the best Spanish brandy , my sister Titi helped me into the hammock , strung up in the cement whitewashed bedroom , between two open windows , where one could watch the blue air boil . I breathed out the fumes of the soup , which tickled my temples , swung in the hammock in pursuit of a breeze , slipped out of my sweat-soaked body , and sunk into the most refreshing siesta of my life . At first I did n't recognize the voice as my mother 's , it was the voice of a young woman , for whom death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from beyond the grave , a cooling breeze , and when she said , ' Pay attention , I knew it was Mother , the easy and confident way she took authority was unmistakably Mama . The cooling breeze from somewhere else bathed me , and I was aware of never before having been so effortlessly attentive , and then Luz Divina said to me , in the calmest and sweetest voice , ' Mami , do n't mourn anymore , six years is sufficient ; if I had lived longer , your suffering would have been inconsolable , because at the age of six , in New York of America , I would have been struck by an automobile and killed , and then your pain would have been unsupportable . Mami , do not mourn for me any longer ' And at that time , I 'd never had any idea of coming to the United States " <p> Laura Providencia watched the last tremors ripple at the top of Senora Ramirez 's bosom . Her hands opened in her lap , and her face resolved itself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't significantly altered the catechism of narrative , she had only paused and reordered the sequence in which she spoke of her children . She concluded as always  --  patted Rosita 's head , and said , " And then this one , who now has , " and she raised both hands , raising five fingers of her right hand , one finger of her left , one digit at a time , took a breath , and said , " six years . " Rosita fidgeted , waiting . Laura stroked her little sister 's thin arm , kissed her cheek , and whispered , " Do n't worry " Laura thought of how it was easiest for her mother to express affection for Luz Divina . Laura recalled a past when she had envied this sister she had never seen , but now she merely thought of Luz Divina as one of the family ; and Rosita 's unhappiness had grown more insistent . Laura Providenicia 's caresses and explanations calmed the child for briefer intervals . Laura could see Rosita 's face working , consuming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would reach for again , before feeding these comforts to her agitation . Laura knew what Rosita was waiting for , and she knew it was n't going to happen . <p> Rosita , thin and brown as a fistful of twigs , at the center of the trembling pink ball of the dress , pushed , and Senora Milagros 's hand flew from the top of Rosita 's head to her own mouth , to catch and cup the small frightened laugh . The stem of Rosita 's neck and her scrawny shoulders shuddered ; she pushed her head between her mother 's huge knees , which looked to Laura like shrouded boulders about to part , as if Rosita were trying to return to the place of her making ; but Laura knew that was n't it , it was only the long waiting , the endless waiting that had commenced on the day they had left the island , after her mother had told Rosita they were going to visit somebody special . Rosita thought they might be going to visit her grandmother ; it was , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abuela 's house . A car would have to be hired  --  usually this happened after the long walk to Uncle Nestor 's village . Laura wondered why her mother never told the children their destination when they went on trips . Always Senora Milagros just took the children out , and they walked and walked and arrived eventually , someplace . Laura had once thought that her mother might have believed that walking about without knowing the destination would give them the feeling of freedom ; or on that day when they left the island , not telling where they were going would obscure the pain of leaving , or maybe her mother thought the children really did n't have to know . Although Laura knew , after a while she figured it out , and Angel knew , too ; but Rosita was so little , she became tired of walking and began to cry . <p> It was a hot , brilliant day . The dust looked like sparks in the sheen of blue air , the ocean beyond the road boomed and gurgled enormously , Rosita 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects hovering about their heads . Senora Milagros stopped in the road , put down and laid open the suitcase at her feet . Rosita plodded to the right of her mother 's hip , veered off the road , and stood there , kneading the hem of her dress . Laura Providencia , Angel , and Aunt Titi were strung out in the road not far behind , each weighted with a portion of boxes , bundles , and shopping bags . Aunt Titi bobbed along the road , pressed and scoured into her sacramental essence , a little taller than a dwarf . The huge crucifix swinging from her neck , driving her forward , she halted , and her smiling face , which might have been carved out of a plum pit , peeked out from the pyramid of bundles she carried unerringly . Senora Milagros bent over , her eyes on the extravagant horizon of the sea as her hand probed in the suitcase , under the folded bedsheet , felt the smooth warm glass of the sealed jar of holy water , and grasped and brandished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might pluck a dove from a bystander 's dumb ear . She thrust the mirror in front of Rosita 's face . " Look child ! Fea ! See how ugly you are when you cry " <p> The face Rosita saw flashing in the mirror was the gaping face of a fish , just before the sun burst an explosion of silver light from the mirror , and then Rosita could see nothing , and she wanted to scream , I 'm blind , but the scream cracked in her throat , and even after Angel had swept her up , and the world came back into her eyes after the successive blinding blows of silver , and blackness , she knew it all could be taken away , immediately , anytime ; and many years later as a middle-aged woman , as she told it all to Laura Providencia , Laura still providing the words , so that she could tell it , Rosita remembered living in an infinite and inexhaustible longing , this recollected as the centuries of someone 's childhood she had been told about . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the wanted and unwanted attention of men throughout her life , and much testimony to the contrary , she knew herself to be ugly . Although Laura Providencia had helped her to say it , she shook her head , no , no ; Rosita shrugged and smiled . <p> They paused in the road parallel to the sea . The surf boomed and hissed . Skittering blotches of green neon  --  spit out from the sea  --  moved on the white sand toward the road and defined themselves as crabs as they crawled out of the glaring light . Aunt Titi gestured for Angel to load his bundles into her arms . Angel obeyed , and divided his bundles and boxes between Aunt Titi and Laura . He could not deny Aunt Titi what she asked for , any more than he doubted her capacity to carry the load . She had planted this belief in him , and in Laura , long before the children could resist belief , long before belief required effort . She , Aunt Titi , Titi diminutive for Tia , Tia Titi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always she had been known as Auntie , even in some past when she must have been a child , although neither Laura nor Angel could imagine that ; but Aunt Titi in the long ago had not so much told them as allowed Laura and Angel to be in the presence of her soliloquies , which said nuns were married to God , and she , Titi , was betrothed to God , forever . Giddy as a Pentecostal with the thought of the end of the world , she 'd mentioned the care of this niece , that nephew , her younger sister , Lucia Milagros , so-and-so who 's dying , and the still nameless she assisted in being born , all of this merely an aspect of her devotion , and Angel and Laura marveled at her abiding contentment . <p> Angel hung a shopping bag from the crook of Aunt Titi 's elbow and stacked parcels in her arms up to her eyes . Aunt Tiff , in her devotions , and under the weight of her burdens , grew smaller and smaller , happy finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They continued . Angel carried Rosita . Rosita 's skinny legs swung , her sandaled feet bouncing off Angel 's thighs . Laura Providencia walked alongside , carrying her pile of boxes and purring at Rosita 's ear . Rosita , in Angel 's arms , her head on his shoulder , kept her eyes opened and whined . Up ahead , Senora Milagros marched under her load of belongings , and in the rear , a motley of parcels jiggled and moved inexorably down the road , behind and under which , Angel and Laura knew , was Aunt Tiff . <p> They arrived in Uncle Nestor 's village . Uncle Nestor , the youngest and most obliging of Aunt Titi and Senora Milagros 's brothers , made the arrangements for the hired car and drove them to the airport . <p> Handsome Uncle Nestor examined his mustache in the rearview mirror , stroking with his forefinger the black lushness of hair on his lip , and navigated the automobile with the barest touch of the steering wheel with his left hand . The car careened and screeched down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Nestor 's dog , El Capitan , who traveled everywhere with Nestor , howled . Aunt Titi , Senora Milagros , Angel , Rosita , and Laura Providencia collided , bounced , and bobbled . Rosita screamed . Angel was fascinated by E1 Capitan . The animal appeared to have been bred from a Russian wolfhound and a goat . Angel , swaying and bouncing , applauded the acrobatic dexterity of El Capitan . The dog managed to remain upright on the floor of the car , his four shivering legs scrabbling in perpetual motion , seemingly sustained by the legato of his wolf howl . The rainbow-hued mountains and God 's gaudy sky fell with them in the side windows of the car hurtling toward cataclysm . Angel looked out of the window at the flamboyant mountains in the distance , heard the screeching tires at the edge of nowhere , the sun 's light gleamed in the windows , and Angel imagined the long fall , deep enough to confound all physics , far enough to have one 's life pass before one 's eyes , suffer remorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's first evening in eternity , before ever hitting bottom . The car spiraled down and down . Uncle Nestor , happy and calm , almost succeeded in taking his attention away from the vision of his face in the mirror . <p> When the car had come down from the mountain and they were hurtling along the long flat road , El Capitan stopped howling . Rosita was still screaming . Senora Milagros turned in the front seat and made a motion with her hands , as if she were going to take the mirror from the suitcase and thrust it in front of Rosita 's face again . Rosita stuck her fingers in her mouth , stifled the scream , and gagged . Aunt Titi fished in the shopping bag between her legs , pulled out a melon , an orange , a pink bow of shiny fabric , and a hairbrush . Aunt Titi gave Angel the melon , Laura the orange , and put the glistening pink bow in Rosita 's lap . Titi began to brush Rosita 's black hair , the slow powerful strokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed the pink bow in Rosita 's hair and said , " One must suffer to be beautiful . " Laura Providencia knew that the point was not beauty , but the virtue in pain . Rosita threw up . <p> They stopped the car , fetched buckets of seawater , and ' cleaned up the mess . They stripped Rosita , standing in the road , Aunt Titi , Senora Milagros , and Laura Providencia shielding the nearnaked child from the sight of Angel and Uncle Nestor . El Capitan ran in circles and barked . Uncle Nestor held his nose and strolled beyond the range of the bad smell . El Capitan ran after him . Aunt Titi opened one parcel , removed various herbs and ingredients she had named but whose names she would not share , and brewed the special tea for Rosita . The heat of the day was such that Titi did not need a fire to cook the ingredients , she poured the tea from a jar into a baby bottle , snapped on the rubber nipple , and vigorously shook the contents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near a palm tree , whose shade was obliterated by the noon-day heat , and sucked the bottle dry . <p> Back in the car Angel cradled her . When they reached the airport , Rosita was still sleeping . Laura Providencia said , " Look , Rosita , an airplane ! We are going to fly " Rosita snored . Angel carried Rosita on the plane . Once during the flight , Rosita 's eyes flickered . Rosita awoke in Nueva York , America . <p> " I want to go home . " Rosita was waiting , still waiting . Senora Ramirez reached over and stroked Rosita 's head . It seemed to Rosita that her mother , through her meanderings , had misplaced home , as she must have misplaced the man who was her father . <p> This , at least , was what Laura thought Rosita was trying to say , as Laura retrieved her little sister 's words , one at a time , from the wet , hiccuping sobs . " And this one , " Senora Milagros said , tugging down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her lap , " this one is never still " <p> Later , in the sketch Laura would make of Senora Ramirez and her mother , and hide in her closet , Laura depicted the two women as nearly identical , the women 's ballooned and shapeless childbearing bodies shrouded in the black , sack-like dresses . Laura 's mother wore the heavy woolen dress with the thick , abrasive rope around where her waist used to be . From the rope 's two ends hung two large weighted knots , each shaped like the clapper in a church bell . <p> After the third month in the United States , Laura 's mother had asked Laura if she would wear the heavy black dress , and the rope , for a while . Senora Milagros explained that now that Laura was a senorita , having menstruated , she could help pay some of the debt that her mother owed to Our Lady of Perpetual Succor . Many years ago , said Senora Milagros , she had promised the saint that if she granted her cousin Teresa , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracted tuberculosismir the saint granted Cousin Teresa one more good long year to live , she , Lucia Milagros , would wear the heavy penitential dress for two years in return for the one year granted Cousin Teresa . But , said Senora Milagros , she was still a young person when she made the vow , and not capable of the necessary seriousness ; she had only worn the dress five months . She was not sure that the misfortune in her life was due to the unpaid debt to Our Lady of Perpetual Succor , but she felt that the debt had undoubtedly made her susceptible to envious people , and the evil eye . Now she had been wearing the dress for almost a year , and the ponderous rope pulled at her back as she sat at the sewing machine in the factory . The pain in her lower back slowed her hands , and she was being paid , she reminded Laura , on the basis of piecework . So , she said , if Laura who was now a senorita took on a small portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there would be the relief to Mother 's back , and she would bring more money into the house . <p> Laura knew that when her mother referred to herself in the third person , and invoked the title " Mother , " her mother had marshaled the moral force of all creation ; and as Laura steeled herself to say no , she felt herself complicit in her mother 's martyrdom . Laura 's voice shook . She explained again that she could n't wear the dress to school . Senora Milagros frowned . Laura said that although such a costume was not expressly forbidden , it was inappropriate . Laura offered to wear the penitential dress during the summer , when she was not attending school . Her mother said , " In the summer I will not need you , by then my debt will have been paid . " <p> Rosita fidgeted in Laura 's arms . Laura pressed her cheek to Rosita 's temple and tightened her embrace . Looking out from the periphery of Rosita 's hot brow , Laura 's vision lingered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's mouth . Senora Milagros looked into Laura 's face , and saw what Laura was seeing , Senora Milagros 's eyes went black and accusatory , as if Laura 's seeing was itself a mockery . Laura felt suddenly like a child caught in a shameful act ; she managed not to blurt out that it was Angel 's fault . He had handed the plates of birthday cake to his mother and Senora Ramirez and run off . It was , after all , his birthday cake , and of course he was gone , out in the street . Laura felt again the presence of his absence , the weight of it in her chest , and then she wanted to apologize to him , too , for the readiness of her heart to heap blame on him . What did it matter that it was the icing on his cake that had smeared Mama 's mouth with the gaudiness ? Laura spoke . " But Mama " she said , " but , " and was startled by the sound of her own voice , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . She reminded herself that she had not denounced her brother , and she made cooing noises in Rosita 's ear . <p> Senora Milagros , with her thumb and pinkie , deftly pinched the corners of her mouth , and the blotches of pink icing disappeared . She looked down at her well-shod feet , and when Senora Milagros looked up again , Laura saw on her mother 's face something like confirmation , a look benign and tantamount to forgiveness ; she had almost smiled . <p> In that first year , Rosita had begun the first grade , and the black girls beat her up . Laura talked to her mother about the hazards of the public school . Children not much older than Rosita were seen making deliveries of drugs in the schoolyard . Senora Milagros had heard of the thirteen-year-old expectant mothers who would not complete the seventh grade . Senora Milagros and Aunt Titi decided on St. Ann 's School for Rosita . <p> Laura delivered Rosita into the custody of the nuns . Nothing in the street frightened Rosita as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned away from the sight of the nun in the arched doorway , and all she could remember of the nun 's face was that it was an inspiration to abstinence and chastity of every kind , and Laura did not wish to see the face again . The school and the church attached to it were the only buildings left standing on the street . Beyond the church and the gray mortuary stone of the school and its fenced-in box of graveled yard was rubble and the smoke-blackened walls of burnt-out buildings . <p> Rosita hung on to the wrought-iron fence in front of the school . She sat down , bunched , and anchored herself on the sidewalk ; her small fists clutched around the iron bars were difficult to get at through the barrier she had made of her hunched upper body . Laura struggled . She reached in through the crevice between Rosita 's upper arm and forearm , and tried to work Rosita 's fingers loose . Laura pleaded . Rosita whimpered . Other children , parents , filed past them and said nothing . Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosita a little way from the fence . Rosita clung , her fists knotted around the iron bars . Laura heard herself wail , and she ran from the sight of Rosita clutching the fence , from the nun whose face neither she nor Rosita wanted to see moving out from under the arched doorway . <p> Laura ran , and remembered Rosita rising obediently from the sidewalk and following the nun into the school , although Laura could not have seen this , running as she was , not wanting to see . But when she remembered it , she remembered always Rosita letting go , rising with a look of sudden forbearance on her face , and following the nun into the school . Laura Providencia described it this way in memory , as over the years Rosita forgave her sister again and again . <p> The white lady with blue hair had come to their house . She was a very tall , thin old lady with a dignified and kindly face . Laura answered the door . She thought that Miss Hamilton resembled a great white bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish ; she would attend a school where she would be required to do what made her happiest , draw pictures for hours on end . Senora Milagros and Aunt Titi thought of Laura 's drawing as an aspect of her tendency for inattentiveness , an eccentricity that could become a vice , if left unattended , but here was this woman of great dignity who had come to their home , the white woman with blue hair , whose tremulous and patrician voice was itself blue . Aunt Titi did not understand a word the blue-haired , bluevoiced old white woman said , but felt and knew an immediate and deep affinity for the magisterial , chaste presence who had honored them by coming to their door . Before Laura was allowed to translate for Miss Hamilton , the dean of student affairs at the High School of Music and Art , Laura 's mother and aunt sent Laura hurrying off with a glance at Laura 's bare feet . <p> In the dark closet , Laura studied the long seam of light in the crack of the slightly opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nothing beyond the possibilities of its design and radiance . She stood in the dark and fondled the everyday shoes cradled in her arms ; she had put her special Sunday patent leather shoes on her feet . She knew she had injured her mother and Aunt Titi by answering the door and admitting Miss Hamilton into the house while she was still barefoot . A letter had come from the school announcing the time and date of Miss Hamilton 's visit and asking if the designated time for the visit was convenient . But Laura Providencia and her mother and aunt had trouble in believing in what the letter said , believing that it could happen , and so they forgot about it ; or , on Laura 's part , not so much forgetting the portentous visit as placing the time of the visit in some messianic future that could never be imminent . <p> Through the crack in the slightly opened closet door and its seam of light , Laura breathed in the powerful hospital smell of the disinfectant her mother had insisted Laura use when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton had seen the drawing she had made of the immaculate grotto that was her home . The drawing was one of the twelve Laura had submitted in a portfolio to the entrance committee . In the drawing , Laura had rendered with colored inks the living room and the peach-colored wall where the flock of pink tin cherubim ascended toward the thorn-crowned bleeding Jesus pointing to his heart in flame . Down , diagonally from the cherubim , on a transparent plastic console , in which a three-dimensional waterfall cascaded beneath a flickering rainbow , a flock of doves , whose wings beat to the mysterious tides of light in the transparent console , supported a large tank of tropical fish . The gloriously colored bits of living flesh darted about in the water , a miniature glass castle , wrecked schooner , and a thumb-sized mermaid with silver breasts imbedded in an ocean floor of candy-colored marbles . Adjacent to the underwater life which was stacked above the waterfall , and past the television set and the clock on the wall  --  a smiling sun with golden spokes supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the profusion of small erect flames spuming thin scrolls of smoke , surrounding a foot-high statue of the Virgin Mary . <p> The composition of the drawing suggested an inventory of the too-fecund miracle of creation , threatening to overwhelm the hallowed space where one might pray . It was funny . Laura had not known the drawing would be funny when she began sketching the sun clock with the radiating spokes and stars her mother had purchased at the five-and-ten , but when she completed the drawing , she had smiled . She was , after she thought about it , tempted to destroy the drawing , but she could not . She included it in her entrance portfolio . Now in the dark closet she heard her mother and her aunt offering Miss Hamilton coffee , and Miss Hamilton , not understanding a word , making flattering statements about their home , which neither her mother nor her aunt understood ; and her mother and aunt were calling " Laura , Laura Providencia , por favor . " Laura decided not to bring her everyday shoes into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the patent leather shoes on her feet were sufficient . But she came out of the closet knowing she had exposed a nakedness , revealed something of the inner life of her family in a way that the living room itself , and her mother and aunt , standing there , could not . In the walk from the bedroom to the living room , Laura had time to change her mind several times . First she concluded that she was not really guilty of betraying her family . What her drawing revealed was something she had not known or intended , and she was , she told herself , as surprised as any stranger to discover what the completed drawing revealed ; but there was something else she could not exonerate herself from , and it festered and thrilled her . The blue-haired white lady carried some idea of who Laura Providencia might be ; Laura did n't know exactly what the idea was , but she suspected that it must be something grand and fine , and Laura knew she had given the picture she had made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in partial payment for the wonderful idea the white lady with blue hair had of her , and she had answered the door barefoot . <p> Senora Milagros , and Titi , Laura Providencia , and Miss Hamilton sat down to coffee . Rosita was napping in her bedroom . Angel was somewhere in the street . Miss Hamilton sipped the inky coffee , and her transparent eyes became avid , while her kindly and dignified smile remained fixed . She said that Laura Providencia was one of three Puerto Rican students accepted at the school . She said that that very day she was going to visit the other two new students , and welcome them to the school ; would it be possible , Miss Hamilton wanted to know , for Laura to accompany her to welcome the new students to the school ? Laura translated the request . Senora Milagros hesitated . She looked at her sister . Aunt Titi nodded yes . Senora Milagros said , " Si . " <p> Down in the street , the white lady with blue hair moved through the neighborhood like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lent Miss Hamilton visibility . <p> Laura was surprised by what her innocent and purposeful hand continued to render . She stacked her drawings on the shelf of the closet , under the shoe boxes and above the rail where her Communion dress hung . She knew herself to be alternately innocent and guilty , but mostly innocent , except for the irreducible something in her that saw , and all that her hand made visible , without a trace of charity for the world it made manifest , or the maker , ostensibly herself . Aunt Titi was certain that the old white-white woman 's visit was a sign , evidence , and vindication for the journey to the United States . Senora Milagros and Aunt Titi did not say so , would not utter it , who knows what malevolent spirit might be present to overhear , but they nodded furtively in affirmation , and insisted on the present of the new special outfit Laura Providencia would wear to her first day of school . <p> Angel and Rosita slept . Senora Milagros , Aunt Titi , and Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in her slip , on a kitchen chair . She dressed and undressed many times . Aunt Titi and her mother sewed and altered the various parts of the garment she would wear . Laura Providencia endured their gift . Wearing it , she would be wearing what her eyes saw , what her hand would render , so that if her hand mocked anything , it mocked her also ; willing , compliant , accepting the gift , she was not completely apart from what she saw and rendered , and there was , Laura Providencia hoped , some form of dispensation in this . She owed it , as her mother owed time in her penitential dress . <p> Aunt Titi had traveled downtown to Orchard Street to purchase from two pushcart vendors and Molly 's Millinery a pink pillbox hat with a white netted veil , the white elbow-length gloves , and a salmon-colored , cake-shaped purse with shoulder straps , large enough to carry lunch , books , pencils , and a handkerchief . Senora Milagros worked very hard to get the bodice of the dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an artichoke , vibrant green , and would have obscured Laura 's waist if not for the tufted , creamy-white sash culminating in a large bow on Laura 's thin hip . Aunt Titi stitched on the bow . The skirt flowed down in nightblue velvet pleats , pocked with silver stars ; the lace hem of the skirt was circled by a flock of doves , chasing each other around , just above Laura Providencia 's feet , which were sheathed in white socks and the Sunday black patent leather shoes . <p> That morning Senora Milagros and Aunt Titi dressed Laura with great care . Laura stood on the kitchen chair , one white socked foot gracefully extended . Her mother bent beneath her and slipped the gleaming black shoe on Laura 's foot . Aunt Titi , just a little taller than the chair Laura stood on , and in a posture that looked like a frozen curtsey , reached up to hold Laura 's hand and steady her balance . The early morning light washed over the dark of the kitchen window and turned one shimmering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her mother tenderly held one foot , Aunt Titi held her hand . Laura Providencia saw herself mirrored in the kitchen window , gowned as some regal tropical plant , floating above the clotheslines and rooftops she could see through the window . Laura recollected having dozed off and waking surprised many times through the long night . She opened her eyes , and her mother asked her to get undressed , to raise her arms , to turn around , to step down from the chair . Laura stepped down from the chair , her elegant descent mimicking a choreography she could vaguely remember having seen somewhere , perhaps in a movie , or maybe she had read it ; and it occurred to her then that she might only be momentarily trapped in her mother 's story ; but the dress was so heavy . <p> Senora Milagros slipped the white elbow-length gloves on Laura 's outstretched arms . Aunt Titi stood on her tiptoes , holding the pink pillbox-shaped hat with the white netted veil just above Laura Providencia 's head . Senora Milagros whispered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hands touched her face softly , rubbed her cheeks , caressed her temples and neck . Laura felt the coolness of the cosmetic smeared with the most meticulous care over every inch of her face and neck . She felt her mother 's calm breath on her closed eyelids , and knew her mother 's belief in this concluding act to be the most she could bestow . <p> Laura Providencia opened her eyes . Her mother stood an arm 's length in front of her , aiming the large hand mirror in which Rosita had seen her face as that of a gaping fish . Laura saw in the mirror that she was white , her caramel-brown face had been turned into a mask of ghostly white . The pink pillbox hat with the white netted veil came down in Titi 's hands , crowning her head . Senora Milagros and Aunt Titi applauded softly , and went to awaken Rosita . <p> Laura Providencia moved down the street under the weight of the garment ; in her white gloved hand she clasped Rosita 's small hand and tugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patter of talk , as her little sister seemed to recognize her voice , even as Rosita looked at the strange person with the ghostly white face with suspicion . Laura saw the street  --  people hurrying towards the subway station  --  and Rosita through the gauzy film of the netted veil . The whitish haze softened everything she saw , as if the whiteness of her skin were giving off the largesse and privilege of its color , everything seen at a remove and modulated by a mist as subtle as dust . <p> People rushed by them hurrying to the subway entrance . Laura kept on talking to Rosita , trying to reassure her that she was herself . Rosita glanced at the person holding her hand , tugging her along the sidewalk . Laura could not lift the veil . It had n't been necessary for her to put words to her tacit understanding ; she was under the obligation of a covenant ; she would not lift up the veil . When they reached the street of St. Ann 's School , Laura was dragging Rosita . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind the large cake-shaped purse containing her books , pencils , lunch , and handkerchief . She could still feel the phantom weight of the heavy purse 's shoulder strap . Rosita was hunkered down , clinging to the wrought-iron fence . Rosita peeked at the ghost face that claimed to be her sister , and at the nun in her black habit with the most forbidding face in the world moving out toward her from under the arched doorway . Laura 's scream billowed out the veil curtaining her mouth as she swung ; she glimpsed the blood gush from Rosita 's nose , and several streets later she saw the blood on her white gloves . <p> Laura Providencia walked slowly down the long hallway . On either side of her , venerable oaken doors emitted a silence she willed herself to inhabit . The crowd following her was noisy and laughing . A series of bells went off louder than a junkyard of alarm clocks , shrill and persistent in the space of half a minute . Many of the students who had been following her ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her path so that Laura could n't go forward , although she had no clear idea of where she was going . Many of the students were shouting questions at her , some seemed concerned , some were laughing . The old white lady with the blue hair and blue voice broke through the crowd . Her face asked a question . Laura Providencia thought she had said , " Yes , miss , ' or " Yes , missis , may I help you ? " but she was n't sure . Somehow , through the long walk down the interminable hallways of the school , Laura Providencia had lost her English . The old white lady with the blue hair did n't recognize her . She looked about the crowd to locate the student who might identify this apparently lost elfin parent . Laura clenched the silence in her throat . Miss Hamilton lifted , from the flat terrain of the breast pocket of her tweed gray tunic , a lorgnette , pinned and hanging from a ribbon . She squinted through the lorgnette she held between thumb and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the gauzy veil , she exclaimed , " Oh my , my " The white face behind the veil was weeping brown streaks into its whiteness . Laura Providencia threw her white-gloved hands up in front of her face . Miss Hamilton saw the blood-stained palms . She touched Laura 's arms , looking for injury . She fluttered her hands and spoke kindly and authoritatively in her blue voice , and the students dispersed . <p> Miss Hamilton led Laura by the hand through one of the oaken doors with a pebbled opaque window . In the women 's faculty bathroom , Miss Hamilton removed the pink veiled hat from Laura 's head and put it on a stool . She stripped the bloodied white elbow-length gloves from Laura Providencia 's arms , dropped the gloves in the sink , and turned on the water faucet . She did all this slowly , softly asking questions until finally Laura answered in Spanish , and Miss Hamilton seemed to grasp the gist of Laura 's responses . Miss Hamilton produced a handkerchief from the sleeve of her gray tunic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura stared into the mirror above the sink and watched the old white lady with blue hair wash her face with the wet handkerchief . In slow circular motions , the old white lady restored Laura Providencia 's face to brown . Laura glanced at the adjacent sink brimming with water turning red , the bloated fingers of the floating glove waved at her . <p> <p> By JACK PULASKI <p>
