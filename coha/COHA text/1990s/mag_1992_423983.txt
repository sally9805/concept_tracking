Long-lost views of sunny , easy days at a wealthy lake resort foreshadow a terrible tragedy <p> Two weeks after completing a film , in 1989 , on the Johnstown Flood , I received word from a woman in New London , New Hampshire , that she had some photographs I might like to see . <p> Since it was too late to revise or change the film , my call to Virginia Anthony Cooper was more out of curiosity than self-interest . Cooper , it turned out , is the great-granddaughter of Charles J. Clarke , a prominent Pittsburgh businessman , who , in the 1880s , with the Carnegies , Mellons , and Fricks , was a member of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club , an exclusive vacation retreat located on a man-made mountain lake fourteen miles above the city of Johnstown , Pennsylvania . <p> It was the dam there , owned and maintained by the club , that failed on the afternoon of May 31 , 1889 , sending 4.5 billion gallons of water down the narrow Conemaugh Valley , devastating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-two hundred men , women , and children . <p> For Cooper to let it be known that her family had been members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club was in itself interesting . After all , it was widely accepted that the Johnstown tragedy was directly related to the club 's negligence . Prior to the disaster the owners had not taken responsibility for proper maintenance of the dam-a dam that had failed once and was considered by many local citizens to be unsafe . <p> From the day I began making the film , I had considered the Johnstown Flood as two stories ; the first being the story of the people of Johnstown , the Scotch-Irish , Cornish , Welsh , and German immigrants who worked in the steel mills and lived in the valley . The other story involved those who summered on the resort mountain lake above the town . Separated by wealth , class , and distance , the two groups lived very different lives , united only by the events of May 31 , 1889 , which left Johnstown in ruins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In making the film , the job of re-creating the flood would prove formidable . Special effects are costly and run the risk of looking contrived . Finding images to depict the aftermath of the flood , on the other hand , posed few problems . Over the years the Johnstown Flood Museum had collected almost every known view of the flood 's devastation . Many of them were famous : photographs of Johnstown showing entire city blocks with houses piled upon one another like firewood ; scenes of locomotives and machinery tossed over the landscape like toys ; stone and steel bridges torn apart ; bodies buried in the mud . <p> Finding the scenes of the other half of the story-the story of life on the mountain-was a different matter . Pictures of life at the lake were missing . Assuming they had been taken at all , they now seemed to have been expunged from the archives . The Johnstown Flood Museum did have a few faded photographs of the clubhouse and one of a row of lakefront cottages , but that was about all . <p> Strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to find . Although none of the club 's members shrank from authorizing biographies , not a single reference could be found in the memoirs of Frick , Phipps , Mellon , or Carnegie claiming membership in the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club or , in fact , that they had ever visited the place . This was understandable . The failure of the dam at South Fork had been responsible for one of the great tragedies in American history . Thousands had died . There had been seventeen million dollars in estimated property damage . Obviously the financial and legal consequences of being a member of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club could prove staggering . <p> In fact , the day after the dam broke , the club lay abandoned . In Pittsburgh members marshaled their legal forces and , in the coming months , successfully repelled attempts to find the club or its members liable . The dam 's failure , so the courts said , had been an act of God . <p> Now , a hundred years later , Virginia Cooper was telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hunting Club actually existed . This was exciting news , albeit news that had come too late . I had searched for eighteen months to find photographs of life on the lake without success and had , in the spring of 1988 , been forced to move actors , livestock , and boats up to a mountain lake near Hollidaysburg , Pennsylvania , to re-create the scenes in the film we were missing . <p> When the package of Cooper 's photographs arrived , I was not prepared for what I would see . On my desk rested a rusty metal canister containing roughly eighty rolls of paper looking very much like high school diplomas without ribbons . An attempt to open them proved perilous . At the slightest touch they cracked . Following the advice of the Smithsonian Institution , I sent the pictures away to be humidified and flattened . When they returned a few weeks later , I was astounded ! <p> It was like opening King Tut 's tomb . Here before us in magnificent detail was life as it was at Lake Conemaugh a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cottages , the clubhouse , the dam . Best of all there were pictures of people-wonderful pictures of the great people of Pittsburgh dressed for afternoon picnics , regattas , and other gatherings . <p> The pictures were the work of Louis Semple Clarke , Cooper 's grandfather , who as a young man had exposed his glass-plate negatives in a camera of his own design . By any measure Louis Clarke was a gifted photographer . At seventeen he was also an inventor , having built in Pittsburgh and moved to the lake a batterypowered catamaran . Clarke would later become a successful industrialist , entrepreneur , and philanthropist . Before his death in 1957 he had founded the Autocar Company and had many inventions to his credit , including an automobile transmission , an improved spark plug , and a naval depth charge . <p> But nothing could have been more remarkable than pictures he had taken of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club a hundred years ago . In fact , so sensitive and revealing was his work that we were determined to make a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no way that Louis Clarke 's photographs were going to be hidden for another hundred years . In the fall of 1991 an expanded version of " The Johnstown Flood , " incorporating Louis Semple Clarke 's photographs , was seen on the PBS series The American Experience , all thanks to Clarke 's proud and loving granddaughter with a sense of American history . <p> PHOTO : The earth dam that will give way rises behind the boaters ; among them , in the sailor suit , is the photographer , Louis Clarke . <p> PHOTO : Life at the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club revolved around the thirty-six-room main building that fronted on the lake . <p> PHOTO : Louis Clarke built a battery-powered catamaran mounted with a searchlight that may have been used to illuminate this night scene . <p> PHOTO : Photos of club life document the pleasures of the young and their mothers ; the busy Pittsburgh industrialists spent little time vacationing . <p> PHOTO : A favorite gathering place , the spillway eventually could n't handle the overflow from heavy rains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club members learn to row on Lake Conemaugh , the man-made pleasure spot , seen here at its most placid and innocent . <p> PHOTO : This photo of Phippses and Clarkes on the clubhouse steps appeared in a recent book - disingenuously labeled " in Austria .
