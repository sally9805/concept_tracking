September 19 Danzar , Croatia The dogs were howling . Sweet Jesus , Bess wished they 'd stop . Focus . Shoot . Move on . Dark here . Adjust the light . The babies ... Oh , God , why ? Do n't think about it . Just take the picture . Focus . Shoot . She needed more film . Bess 's hands were shaking as she opened the camera , took out the used roll , and inserted a new one . " We have to leave , Ms. Grady . " Sergeant Brock stood in the doorway behind her . His words were polite but his expression was full of revulsion as he stared at her . " They 're right outside the village . You should n't be here . " Focus . Shoot . Blood . So much blood . " We have to go . " Another room . The camera was knocked out of her hand . Sergeant Brock now stood in front of her , his face white . " What are you ? Some sort of ghoul ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . Not anymore . She was exploding inside . She had to do it . She bent down and picked up the camera . " Wait in the jeep for me . I wo n't be long . " She scarcely heard his curse as he turned on his heel and left her alone . No , not alone . The babies ... Focus . Shoot . She could get through this . No , she could n't . She leaned against the wall and closed her eyes . Closed out the babies . The dogs continued their howling . She could n't shut them out . Monsters . The world was full of monsters . So do your job . Let everyone see the monsters . She opened her eyes and lurched toward the last room . Do n't think . Do n't listen to the dogs . Just focus . Shoot . Move on . January 21 , 4:50 P.M. Mexico She just might murder her . " You see ? I told you so , " Emily said , beaming . " This is working out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove into yet another pothole . " I hate people who say I told you so . And will you stop being so damn cheerful ? " " No , I 'm happy . You will be too , when you admit that I was entirely right to persuade you to bring me with you . " Emily turned to the driver in the seat next to her . " How far , Rico ? " " Six , maybe seven hours . " The boy 's cheerful smile lit his dark face . " But we should stop and set up camp for the night . I 'll need to see the road . From here it gets a little rough . " Another bone-jarring bump punctuated the sentence . " This is n't rough ? " Bess asked dryly . Rico shook his head . " The government takes good care of this road . No one repairs the one into Tenajo . Not enough people to matter . " " How many is that ? " " Maybe a hundred . When I left a few years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are gone now , like me . Who wants to live in a village that does n't even have a movie theater ? " He glanced over his shoulder at Bess , who was sitting in the back . " I do n't think you will find anything interesting about Tenajo to photograph . There 's nothing there . No ruins . No important people . Why bother ? " " It 's for a series of articles I 'm doing for Traveler on undiscovered destinations in Mexico , " Bess explained . " And there better be something in Tenajo , or the Cond Nast people wo n't be happy . " " We 'll find something for you , " Emily said . " Practically every Mexican town has a plaza and a church . We 'll go from there . " " Oh , will we ? Are you directing my shoots now ? " Emily smiled . " Just this one . I approve of this assignment . I like the idea of you shooting nice , pretty scenery instead of having crazy idiots shoot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For God 's sake , you ended up in a hospital after Danzar . What you 're doing is n't good for you . You should have finished medical school and gone into pediatric surgery with me . " " I 'm not tough enough . I knew it the night that kid died in the emergency room . I do n't know how you do it . " " I suppose Somalia was easy and Sarajevo was a piece of cake . And what about Danzar ? When are you going to tell me what happened at Danzar ? " Bess stiffened . " Stay out of my job , Emily . I mean it . I do n't need supervision . I 'm almost thirty . " " You 're also exhausted and drained , and still you have an obsession with that damn camera . You have n't taken it off your neck since we started this trip . " Bess 's hand instinctively went up to cup the camera . She needed her camera . It was part of her . After all these years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was no use trying to explain to Emily . Emily had always seen things in black and white ; she had absolute confidence that she knew right from wrong . And she had always tried to guide Bess into doing what she thought was right . Most of the time Bess could handle it . But Danzar had shattered her , and that had alerted all of Emily 's protective instincts . Bess should have stayed away , but she had n't seen Emily in a long time . And besides , she loved the bossy bitch . Now Emily 's older-sister mode was in full bloom . Time to change the subject before she became any more dictatorial . " Emily , why do n't you try to get Tom on the cellular ? Rico said we 'll be out of range of any tower pretty soon . " Emily was immediately distracted as Bess knew she would be . Her husband , Tom , and their ten-year-old daughter , Julie , were the center of Emily 's existence . " Good idea , " she said , pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be my last chance . They 're taking off at dawn for Canada to do that wilderness thing . No telephone , no TV , no radio . Just Tom passing on his survival expertise to his heir . " Holding the receiver to her ear , she listened intently , then scowled . " Too late . Nothing but static . Why could n't you choose a civilized little village to bring me to ? " " I did n't choose , I was sent here on assignment . And you were n't invited . " Ignoring the jab , Emily turned to Rico , who had been politely ignoring the discussion between the sisters . " We can stop now . It 's getting dark . " " As soon as I find a stretch of flat ground to set up camp , " Rico said . Emily nodded , then looked at Bess . " Do n't think I 've said all I want to say . Our conversation is n't over yet . " Bess closed her eyes . " Oh , my God . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're setting up camp . " Kaldak lowered the binoculars . " But there 's no doubt they 're on their way to Tenajo . What do you want to do ? " Colonel Rafael Esteban frowned . " This is most unfortunate . It could cause complications . When do you expect the report from Mexico City ? " " An hour or two more . I sent the order as soon as we caught sight of them this morning . We already know the license plates are registered to Laropez Travel . Finding out who the hell they are and what they 're doing here is what 's taking time . " " Unfortunate , " Esteban murmured . " I detest complications . And everything was going so well . " " Then remove the complication . Is n't that why you brought me here ? " " Yes . " Esteban smiled . " You came highly recommended in that area . What is your suggestion ? " " Put them down . Disposal should be no problem out here . It 'll take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But what if they 're not innocent tourists ? What if they have awkward ties ? " Kaldak shrugged . " That 's the problem with people of your ilk , " Esteban said . " Too bloodthirsty . It 's no wonder Habin was willing to let you go . " " I 'm not bloodthirsty . You wanted a solution . I gave it to you . And Habin has no objection to blood . He sent me to you because he felt uncomfortable around me . " " Why ? " " His fortune-teller told him I 'd be the death of him . " Esteban burst out laughing . " Stupid ox . " His laughter faded as he stared at Kaldak . That face ... If the Dark Beast could be personified , it would have a face like Kaldak 's . He could see why a superstitious fool like Habin would be uneasy . " I do n't use fortune-tellers , Kaldak , and I 've put down better men than you . " " If you say so . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're spreading out their sleeping bags . Now would be the time . " " I said we 'll wait . " He had n't said any such thing , but he would n't have Kaldak pushing him . " Go back to camp and bring me the report when it comes in . " Kaldak started toward the jeep parked a few yards away . His instant obedience should have reassured Esteban but it did n't . Indifference , not fear , spurred that obedience , and Esteban was not accustomed to indifference . He instinctively moved to assert his superiority . " If you must kill someone , Galvez has offended me . It would n't displease me to see him dead when I return to camp . " " He 's your lieutenant . He may still have his uses . " Kaldak started the jeep . " You 're sure ? " " I 'm sure . " " Then I 'll take care of it . " " Are n't you curious what he did to offend me ? " " No . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's a very stupid man . He asked me what was going to happen at Tenajo . He 's been entirely too curious . Do n't make the same mistake . " " Why should I ? " Kaldak met his gaze . " When I do n't give a damn . " Esteban felt a ripple of frustration as he watched the jeep bounce down the hill . Son of a bitch . Having Kaldak obey his command to kill should have brought the familiar flush of triumph . But it did n't . Kaldak would have to go the way of Galvez when it was convenient . At the moment , he needed the entire team to complete this phase of the job . But after Tenajo ... January 22 , 3:35 A.M. Tenajo . Holy Virgin , help them . Their immortal souls are writhing in Satan 's fire . Father Juan knelt at the altar , his gaze fixed desperately on the golden crucifix above him . He had been in Tenajo for forty-four years and his flock had always listened before . Why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He could hear them in the square outside the church , shouting , singing , laughing . He had gone out and told them they should be in their homes at this time of night , but it had done no good . They had only offered to share the evil with him . He would not take it . He would stay inside the church . And he would pray that Tenajo would survive . * * * " You slept well , " Emily told Bess . " You look more rested . " " I 'll be even more rested by the time we leave here . " She met Emily 's gaze . " I 'm fine . So back off . " Emily smiled . " Eat your breakfast . Rico is already packing up the jeep . " " I 'll go help him . " " It 's going to be all right , is n't it ? We 're going to have a good time here . " " If you can keep yourself from --  " Oh , what the hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You bet . We 're going to have a great time . " " And you 're glad I came , " Emily prompted . " I 'm glad you came . " Emily winked . " Gotcha . " Bess was still smiling as she reached the jeep . " Ah , you 're happy . You slept well ? " Rico asked . She nodded as she stowed her canvas camera case in the jeep . Her gaze went to the hills . " How long has it been since you 've been in Tenajo ? " " Almost two years . " " That 's a long time . Is your family still there ? " " Just my mother . " " Do n't you miss her ? " " I talk to her on the phone every week . " He frowned . " My brother and I are doing very well . We could give her a fine apartment in the city , but she would not come . She says it would not be home to her . " She had clearly struck a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful place or Cond Nast would n't have sent me . " " Maybe for those who do n't have to live there . What does my mother have ? Nothing . Not even a washing machine . The people live as they did fifty years ago . " He violently slung the last bag into the jeep . " It is the priest 's fault . Father Juan has convinced her the city is full of wickedness and greed and she should stay in Tenajo . Stupid old man . There 's nothing wrong with having a few comforts . " He was hurting , Bess realized , and she did n't know what to say . " Maybe I can persuade my mother to come back with me , " Rico added . " I hope so . " The words sounded lame even to her . Great , Bess . She searched for some other way to help . " Would you like me to take her photograph ? Maybe the two of you together ? " His face lit up . " That would be good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . " He paused . " Maybe you could tell her how well I 'm doing in Mexico City . How all the clients ask just for me ? " He hurried on : " It would not be a lie . I 'm very much in demand . " Her lips twitched . " I 'm sure you are . " She got into the jeep . " Particularly among the ladies . " He smiled boyishly . " Yes , the ladies are very kind to me . But it would be wiser not to mention that to my mother . She would not understand . " " I 'll try to remember , " she said solemnly . " Ready ? " Emily had walked to the jeep , and was now handing Rico the box containing the cooking implements . " Let 's go . With any luck we 'll be in Tenajo by two and I 'll be swinging in a hammock by four . I ca n't wait . I 'm sure it 's paradise on earth . " * * * Tenajo was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon sun . From the hilltop overlooking the town Bess could see a picturesque fountain in the center of the wide cobblestone plaza bordered on three sides by adobe buildings . At the far end of the plaza was a small church . " Pretty , is n't it ? " Emily stood up in the jeep . " Where 's the local inn , Rico ? " He pointed at a street off the main thoroughfare . " It 's very small but clean . " Emily sighed blissfully . " My hammock is almost in view , Bess . " " I doubt if you could nap with all that caterwauling , " Bess said dryly . " You did n't mention the coyotes , Rico . I do n't think that --  " She stiffened . Oh , God , no . Not coyotes . Dogs . She had heard that sound before . Those were dogs howling . Dozens of dogs . And their mournful wail was coming from the streets below her . Bess started to shake . " What is it ? " Emily asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It could n't be . It was her imagination . How many times had she awakened in the middle of the night to the howling of those phantom dogs ? " Do n't tell me nothing . Are you sick ? " Emily demanded . It was n't her imagination . " Danzar . " She moistened her lips . " It 's crazy but --  We have to hurry . Hurry , Rico . " Rico stomped on the accelerator , and the jeep careened down the road toward the village . They did n't see the first body until they were inside the town .
