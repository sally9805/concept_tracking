<p> CHANGING SHEETS IS NECESSARY AND changing clothes is fun , but people are much more comfortable if everything else stays the same . So said the sociologists Robert S. and Helen Lynd in their 1929 study of Middle America , " Middletown . " " It is characteristic of mankind , " they wrote , " to make as little adjustment as possible in customary ways in the face of new conditions ; the process of social change is epitomized in the fact that the first Packard car body delivered to the manufacturer had a whipstock on the dashboard . " <p> And yet the world keeps undergoing not merely change but major upheavals requiring immense shifts in life styles . This happens everywhere , but perhaps nowhere in this century has it happened more consistently and frequently than in China , where events have repeatedly altered everything as thoroughly as an avalanche . Photographers both Chinese and Western have caught these changes as they happened ; if you pointed a camera at China for more than a decade , you were bound to capture some shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide easy , almost palpable access to major historical realignments . Photographs are splendid repositories of history , so long as historians explain what they are really about . <p> Right now , with Hong Kong still fresh in everyone 's mind , it is hard to avoid some sort of visual record of China 's lurch through history . " Marc Riboud : Forty Years of Photography in China , " at the International Center of Photography uptown , puts approximately 100 photographs from four crucial decades on view , including a few pictures taken in Hong Kong this May . He chiefly chronicles the radical swing from a patched-coat peasant culture that was first liberated and then decimated by Mao , to a mad capitalist economy addicted to money and miniskirts . ( The exhibition , which runs through Sept. 14 , was supported by Kodak Professional and CCF , a French bank . ) Fifty additional pictures are available in " Marc Riboud in China : Forty Years of Photography , " published by Abrams . <p> The Asia Society has a fine show of some 75 earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picturing Hong Kong : Photographs 1855-1910 , " which traces Hong Kong from backwater fishing port to British merchandise mart , fiefdom and , some would have said , foreign concubine ; that show continues through Aug. 17 . And late last year Random House published Jonathan D. Spence and Annping Chin 's " Chinese Century : A Photographic History of the Last Hundred Years " with surprises from throughout the century , including a couple by Riboud . <p> As Spence and Chin demonstrate with some little-known images , the Chinese century was wrenched from imperium to republic to Japanese victim , from triangular bound feet to high heels , from rickshaws to motorcars . ( There is a wonderful 1924 picture of a paper Model A Ford and chauffeur being carried to the cemetery for burning to insure transport for the dead man in the spirit world . ) Nothing endures but change : in the second half of the century , China swung from Communism and Mao worship to bloody Tiananmen and the invention of leisure time for workers . Westerners have heard many times that Shanghai has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that this is the second time round , the first being in the 1920 's , when jazz and Western films held sway . <p> Riboud 's 40-year work maintains a traditional , almost classical style , strongly influenced by Henri Cartier-Bresson . Not images to make you jump up and down , they are solid and sharply observed . This is , perhaps , a heritage of Magnum , the agency founded in 1957 by Cartier-Bresson , David Seymour and Robert Capa that has been home to many of the finest Western photojournalists in the last four decades . <p> Riboud photographed China in black and white , the revered documentary approach that magazines almost did away with in the late 70 's and only recently have begun to publish again . His pictures generally strive for clarity , lucidity , order and balanced compositions , with the subject frequently in the center . At times he even looks for beauty , a quality unfortunately thought infra dig by trendsetters today . <p> Some contemporary photojournalism rather frantically calls attention to its own cleverness , but Riboud 's pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the advantage of being calm , informative and uninsistent . The style looks easier and more casual than it is , as anyone who has tried to do what he does for longer than a day will tell you . He catches a few decisive moments but more often decisive details , like the baby crawling up a step and revealing a bare bottom because Chinese baby garments are , or were , made with a permanent , and convenient , opening . <p> Usually he makes a very specific point , although if ever photographs needed captions to confirm their thrust , these do . The book 's text explains and expands : a laughing peasant , in 1995 , stands some distance from a white house in what looks like a standard genre picture until we learn that the house is the show-off domain of the local police chief , built with an enforced contribution from everyone in the town . And a windshield was adorned with a picture of Chairman Mao in 1992 , not , according to the text , as a political statement but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a driver with just such a photograph , so Mao was now thought to have joined the pantheon of protector gods . <p> Riboud managed to enter China at the end of 1956 and was allowed to return often ; he writes at the I.C.P. that he is " possibly the only Westerner who has photographed China consistently since the 1950 's . " There were some limits on him as a Westerner . He speaks of a " guardian angel " ( a guide he sometimes gave the slip to ) and some restrictions he partially circumvented with devices like a wide-angle lens . He has scant images of the bad news about the Cultural Revolution , which the Government was adept at covering up . For re-education , famine , persecutions , executions , see " The Chinese Century , " where most of the pictures of that episode that even Mao came to regret were taken by Chinese photographers . <p> In the light of today 's thinking , Western images of China from colonial times betray the prejudices of their time , and someday Riboud 's pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , either because the photographers are necessarily limited to their own backgrounds or because they were concentrating on what they knew the rest of us wanted to see . <p> " Picturing Hong Kong " repeatedly points out the different approaches to and uses of portraits of Europeans and Chinese , the Western insistence on the picturesqueness of the " other , " and photographers ' studied avoidance of certain subjects . Over time , people wise up and jettison certain stereotypes , yet new ones are always waiting in the wings for a chance to go on stage . A journalist photographs what he sees , but seeing involves preconceptions , and choices . <p> RIBOUD 'S PERSONAL predilection is for contrast , which perfectly suits his aim . His pictures frequently set old against new , rich against poor : a picture of illiterates in a classroom in 1957 next to a photograph of computer workers in 1993 ; a ragged man with a sack over his shoulder in ' 93 opposite a young couple with a cell phone and a Game Boy . Riboud also relishes contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sexy ad for nylon panties  --  the manufacturer 's label is " three stacked rifles "  --  next to men steaming bread in the traditional wooden sieves . <p> Contrast is a rhetorical device , a shorthand way to make a point without bothering with transitions . It is especially useful in education and propaganda : " Compare and contrast " is a standard test question , " before and after " a standard sales pitch for plastic surgery . China is so immense and various and its history so vertiginous that contrasts are unavoidable , and if the main point that you wish to make is the extent of change over four decades , then surprising juxtapositions are a natural teaching device . <p> In China over that period , the changes amounted to dislocations . Westernization accelerated in the 1980 's as the country set a door ajar for Western businesses and made exchange agreements with Western film and television companies . Advertising and foreign styles poured across the Great Wall , profoundly altering the urban and even the rural landscape . Entertainment is becoming America 's largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the world look like us . Riboud 's pictures are rife with advertisements , in a nation that until recently did not want to sell its people much besides ideology . <p> Riboud 's show opens with a 1965 picture of schoolchildren in Guangxi walking to school with enormous straw rain hats on their backs . The photographer writes that it rains heavily in this southern province , which is ideal for rice crops , and that the hats can be passed down from generation to generation . " The Chinese Century " has a photograph from Hankou in 1927 of southern Chinese soldiers wearing these same hats on their backs . " Foreigners mistook these for shields , " the text says , " contemptuously believing they were evidence of the primitive state of China 's forces . " <p> Change or no change , many things stay the same : the rain still rains , the hats still keep it out ( if plastic has not replaced them ) , and foreigners still look at pictures for evidence they may not be able to read .
