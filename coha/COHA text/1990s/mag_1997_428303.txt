In the training business , your body is your billboard . Here , how seven top trainers protect their greatest assets <p> WOULD N'T IT BE NICE to know how your accountant saves money on his taxes ? Or what tricks your car mechanic uses to keep his vehicle purring ? Or where your travel agent goes on her vacation ? You ca n't beat this kind of hard-won insider knowledge . But where do you turn for the straight dope on getting in shape ? Your old high-school gym teacher ? He 'd just tell you to do some jumping jacks and always , always wear a jock . No , the best source is a personal trainer , one of those hard-bodies with boundless energy who pay their mortgages by turning slugs into Schwarzeneggers . We got seven top fitness experts from across the country to reveal how they stay fit . They also shared plenty of normal-guy tips on everything from nutrition to exercise equipment , which they 've gleaned through years of doing every type of activity imaginable . Whether you 're into hoops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a trainer who 's been there and done that . Think of these regimens as a fitness smorgasbord and pick the morsels that look good to you . So pitch that old jockstrap . Here 's some real athletic support . THE TRAINER : <p> Todd Person , owner of Metabolic Project , a personal-training business in West Los Angeles ; he has worked with such celebrities and athletes as Michael Keaton and John McEnroe <p> THE SECRET : Join the resistance . Like most of the trainers we spoke with , Person depends on a variety of activities to keep himself in top shape . What distinguishes his routine from the others ? Each of his workouts , even those that focus mainly on flexibility and cardiovascular conditioning , incorporates some kind of resistance training . <p> Take power yoga , the centerpiece of Person 's routine . Three or four days a week , he takes a private , 60-minute class in which he slowly does a series of difficult postures , many of which involve resistance . For instance , he 'll strap on ankle weights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over at the waist , puts both hands on the floor and lifts one leg up as straight as possible while balancing on his other leg . <p> Even Person 's five tough cardiovascular workouts often involve some kind of resistance . One of his favorites is a 45to 60-minute walk ( outdoors or on a treadmill ) with 46 pounds worth of bandoliers  --  quilted vinyl bands filled with metal shot  --  crisscrossing his chest ( warning : that 's a bit much for most guys ) . " I look like I 'm in an old movie about the Mexican Army , " he jokes , " but this exercise is my ace in the hole for shrinking love handles . " He walks at a brisk pace , just under 15 minutes per mile . No wonder his resting pulse is 46 beats per minute . <p> Twice a week , Person also does conventional strength training . His routine includes 14 exercises , with moves for both upper and lower body . He aims for as much weight as he can handle for 12 repetitions  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> Another secret : Person occasionally employs the super-slow method , taking a full 10 seconds to lift the weight and another 10 to lower it . On slow days , he does just one set of each exercise , with eight or nine repetitions on lower-body exercises and six for the upper body . <p> TRAINER 'S TIP : Fresh out of bandoliers for power-walking ? Hand and wrist weights or a weighted vest ( available at sporting-goods stores ) work well , too . If you 're new to this exercise , start with 8 to 10 pounds of weight . THE TRAINER : <p> Kevin Stevens , a fitness consultant and exercise physiologist at World Gym in New York <p> THE SECRET : Strategic running for a lean , strong body . A decade ago , Stevens was a 6-foot-2 , 235-pound defensive end for the Northeast Louisiana University football team . Once out of school , he soon realized he did n't want or need that kind of bulk . He embarked on a running and weight-lifting program and today weighs 205 pounds . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , he ca n't help thinking they could stand to do the same . <p> " It 's a hard transition from football weight to normal-citizen weight , " he says , " I see some of my former teammates still carrying those extra pounds . " <p> Stevens stays lean by competing in a 5K ( 3.1 miles ) race once a month . To keep in competitive shape , he runs about four mornings a week for a total of approximately 15 miles . His weekly routine goes like this : <p> SUNDAY : a 6-miler done at 8 1/2 minutes per mile <p> TUESDAY : a 4-mile " form run " run " on a tread-mill in front of a mirror so he can check his cadence , technique and pace <p> THURSDAY : a speed session with eight 400-meter sprints interspersed with 200-meter jogs <p> FRIDAY : a 2-mile time trial in which he runs 20 New York City blocks , and then back , in fewer than 15 minutes . <p> Stevens spends his nonrunning days in the weight room . He sticks to basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and curls . He works his chest , back , arms and trunk on Mondays and , if he 's not racing that weekend , Fridays . Wednesdays are devoted to legs and shoulders , and Saturday is his day off . <p> " I 'm always challenging myself , " he says . " Some of my teammates never did that after they got out of school . " <p> TRAINER 'S TIP : When weight lifting , Stevens says , " most guys have too short a strength range . " They might do a set of bench presses at 135 pounds , a second set at 145 pounds and a final set at 155 pounds . For a greater challenge and faster strength gains he suggests starting with a very light set  --  say , 115 pounds  --  followed bye a moderate set ( 145 pounds ) and a very challenging set at 175 pounds . " This loads the muscle more efficiently ; yet since you 're starting light . you 're less likely to be injured , " he says . THE TRAINER : <p> Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE SECRET : Target opposing muscle groups The cornerstone of Culwell 's three-day-a-week weight-lifting routine is working opposing muscle groups one right after another . For instance , he does a seated row followed by a chest press , a leg extension followed by hamstring curls , or biceps curls followed by triceps extensions . A full-body body session takes 60 to 75 minutes . One benefit of this approach is that he can pack more exercises into a shorter time , because he does n't have to wait for each muscle group to recover between sets . By keeping his heart rate up , it also burns more calories . <p> As for cardiovascular exercise , you 'd do well to take an aerobics class , says Culwell . But not one of those boring classes filled with overweight women sweating to the disco version of " Addicted to Love . " As an aerobics instructor , Culwell knows the importance of shaking things up . One week he 'll take a class outside to do football drills . The next week they might do boxing aerobics , body sculpting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability balls " used in physical therapy . <p> " I like to shock the system  --  keep the body always guessing what it will be doing next , " he says . " When your body is used to something , you reach a plateau and do not see results . " Culwell rounds out his regimen with a Saturday cardiovascular workout-either a 5-mile run , a 20- to 30-mile bike ride , or a 1- to 2-hour skate on his inline blades . <p> TRAINER 'S TIP : To make walking or even jogging more challenging , Culwell does it backward . " it provides Variety and Improves agility and balance , - he says . Culwell walks backward for 1 to 2 minutes at time , and does about 1 minute of backward walking for every 8 or 7 minutes of regular walking . He recommends doing it outdoors only , not on a treadmill . THE TRAINER : <p> Neil Maki , owner of Dynamic Fitness , a training service for fitness instructors ; he is an aerobics teacher in the Detroit area <p> THE SECRET : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find Maki , look in the weight room . He 's there six days a week . But while pumping in the weight room is an old fashioned way of getting in shape , Maki has brought to his workout a definite New Age approach . His basic plan consists of four sets of each exercise , at 8 to 10 repetitions . When he can do 11 or 12 repetitions , he increases the weight . <p> MONDAYS AND FRIDAYS : Four chest exercises , two or three for the triceps and four for the shoulders . He spends 2 seconds on the pushing phase and 4 seconds on the release phase . <p> TUESDAYS AND SATURDAYS : Six back exercises and two for the biceps . <p> WEDNESDAYS AND SUNDAYS : A 60- to 75-minute leg routine involving seven different exercises . <p> It all sounds rather staid , but lately , Maki 's made big strength gains with a technique called the Systematic Touch Training Program . This involves a specially trained partner who , as you lift , touches the muscle you 're working in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's nervous-system exploitation , " explains Maki , who has also been trained in the technique . " The amount of focus dedicated to working the muscle is heightened . It creates better awareness of the body so you know why you 're using a particular muscle . " <p> But even a gym rat like Maki knows complete fitness requires more than pumping iron . On the cardiovascular front , he leads a 60-minute aerobics class five days a week . And he works out with clients three days a week , doing 50minute combinations of power walking and mountain biking . Occasionally , he 'll throw in some intervals , like striding up a hill or sprinting on the bike . <p> TRAINER 'S TIP : A lot of lifters confuse stretching and warming up . Warming up means 5 to 10 minutes of cardiovascular activity  --  enough to break a light sweat . It does n't mean doing some twisting with a broomstick over your shoulder  --  that 's actually stretching . The beat time to stretch is between sets , instead of resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Fitness ; a personal trainer and owner of Better Bodies , his own fitness consulting business <p> THE SECRET : Competition . Anderson has built a career on setting goals and achieving them . He got his start in the Army , designing training programs for soldiers who could n't pass their fitness tests . Today he keeps himself in peak shape by taking on challenges that would leave lesser men whimpering in a pool of their own sweat . His current goals : the Chicago Marathon and the Sharper Fitness Ultimate Athlete contest , which features exercises like a vertical jump , weight lifting and throwing a 20-pound ball . Training for either of these vastly different contests would be enough to put a guy in killer shape . Anderson is training for both at the same time . <p> " I do n't want to be some huge guy who ca n't run 2 miles , or a little guy who ca n't lift his own body weight , " says Anderson , who 's 5-foot-7 and 15 5 pounds . " I believe in optimal fitness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided his training into three four-month segments . In general , he runs three to four times a week and rides a stationary bike one day a week . <p> First four months : A total of 20 to 25 miles each week-usually a 10-miler , a 4-or 5-miler and a 3- or 4-miler . <p> Second four months : Anderson stuck to his original workout but added a longer run-up to 18 miles-every two weeks . He also added bi-weekly speed work-six to eight 800-meter sprints with 3 to 4 minutes of walking between each . He also did a 30- to 40-minute hill run once a week . ( Tired yet ? ) <p> Final four months : Every three to four weeks , he 'll do a long run of up to 3 hours ( 22-plus miles ) . He also does speed- work featuring four 1-mile intervals with 4 minutes of walking between each , while still keeping to his hill workouts . <p> For the Ultimate Athlete contest , Anderson hits the weight room four times a week . He trains a different body part each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per session . He does two opposing muscle group supersets of 8 to 12 slow repetitions , taking a 60- to 70-second rest between sets only if he needs it . " Training at this volume builds muscular strength , " he says . THE TRAINER : <p> Dale Huff , C.S.C.S. , co-owner of NutriFormance , a St. Louis-based in-home personal training company , a registered dietitian , and a certified personal trainer <p> THE SECRET : Train for the game . Huff used to base his training on " appearance goals "  --  decreasing his body  --  fat percentage or enlarging his chest and biceps-but often found it difficult to monitor his progress . " Unless you do fitness evaluations , it 's hard to see your progress , because you look at yourself every day , " he says . So he revived his motivation by switching to performance goals , like driving a golf ball farther or lifting more weight . <p> Huffs goals change depending on the sports season . This year , for example , he designed a three days-per-week , hoops-specific program to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His routine , which takes about 80 minutes , starts with 15 minutes of plyometrics  --  a training method designed to build power using explosive leaping movements ( see box on page 122 ) . He also does a couple of tough , targeted moves to build powerful quadriceps . <p> For the cardiovascular part of his workout , Huff uses interval training to mimic the stop-and-start demands of an intense basketball game . He alternates 30-second high-speed sprints with 60-second bouts of jogging . " I get a great workout in only 20 minutes , " he says . Three times a week , Huff finishes with a 45-minute , full-body strength routine , using a combination of dumbbell , barbell and body-weight exercises , such as pushups and pullups . <p> To keep his routine fresh , every four months Huff takes a week of active rest  --  no working out , just hiking , playing tennis or waterskiing . Then he designs a new workout plan based around a new sport . In the fall , he plays softball , so he incorporates such routines as agility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Huff focuses on raw strength-building : a 90-minute workout using heavy weights and low repetitions , with four or five exercises per body part . <p> " People get caught up in doing the same old thing , " Huff says . " But you can challenge yourself in a variety of ways . " <p> TRAINER 'S TIP : For a quick . nutritious meal , microwave canned black beans on a flour tortilla with low-fat cheese and salsa . " It 's full of complex carbohydrates , " says Huff . THE TRAINER : <p> Damond McCain , a personal trainer , group fitness instructor and health-club manager in Corona , California <p> THE SECRET : Train indoors for the outdoors . " You can work out for working out 's sake only for so long , " says McCain . " When you 're a zombie on a treadmill , you lose intensity and hit a plateau . " That 's why he prefers to take his clients  --  most of whom are n't athletic  --  out of the gym and into activities that do n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to involve scuba diving , rock climbing , even skydiving . " We do n't associate outside activities with work , " he says . " We associate them with play . " <p> He joins his clients in training for a designated activity three times a week , for an hour each session . If it 's scuba diving they 've planned , they might do lap swims or work out in the pool with weights and aqua equipment . If the activity is hiking , they 'll walk , outdoors or on a treadmill , eventually progressing to inclines with a loaded backpack . <p> McCain follows the same principle in his own workouts . At least three times a month , he shoulders a 15- to 25-pound backpack and goes for a 4-hour hike in the mountains . He covers 8,000 to 10,000 vertical feet , often scrambling over boulders . " It 's great for the quadriceps , gluteals and hamstrings , " he says . <p> " I need a lot of different activities or I get bored , " he says . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one setting ? " <p> TRAINER 'S TIP : If you 're pressed for time , run stain . McCain recommends 15 or 20 minutes , but for the rest of us mortals , 10 is plenty . Or try lunging up the stairs and walking down . To lunge , lift one leg one to three steps , crouch , then bring your other leg up by pressing down with your lead leg . Now take another step leading with the same leg . Think of it as a one-legged aquas in which you go up instead of forward . Try to do an entire flight leading with the same leg ; then switch legs for your second flight .
