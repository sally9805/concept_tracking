<p> ' GLORIOUS VICTORY ' <p> Editor  --  Only a year ago the United States had half-a-million troops in " Saudi . " The Persian Gulf war seems like it happened in another life . Maybe that will give us a better perspective . Let 's look back , and do the math . <p> About 150 Americans lost their lives in combat , plus or minus 25 killed by friendly fire . Iraq lost 1,000 times as many  --  mostly poor guys who were marched out into the desert , some to be literally buried alive by U.S. tanks . The bombing was intended to rid the world of one man  --  a latter-day " Hitler . " He remains in power , recruiting Russian nuclear engineers . <p> We said we would bomb Iraq back to the Stone Age , and we did nothing personal , of course , nothing against the " Iraqi people . " Reports of widespread hunger and disease as a result of the destruction of Iraq 's infrastructure go unnoticed . As predicted , children are dying by the thousands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , muddy nightmare for the Kurds . It has fanned the flames of militant Islamic fundamentalism in Saudi Arabia , Jordan , Algeria and Egypt . And most of all , it conveyed the lesson that war is the legitimate court of last resort . Yugoslavia and Georgia are " litigating " right now . <p> Add it all up , and this was our glorious victory in the gulf . Do we really think that Providence will continue to bless a people who celebrate such a victory ? <p> MARTIN LeFEVRE <p> Cupertino <p> . <p> RUNAWAY INDUSTRIES <p> Editor  --  It would have seemed timely for President Bush , in his recent Asiatic tour , to speak first to his entourage of American industrialists concerning their investing in the U.S. True , this would mean their receiving smaller profits than from their earlier investments in the cheaper labor markets of the world . <p> After 1945 , the U.S. shipyards declined in the building of a new merchant shipping fleet . The American shipowners then started the practice of building their ships in other countries and manned them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first runaway industry followed by steel , auto , textiles , shoes and other heavy industries . We are now the only major country which does not favor its own heavy industry . <p> After four decades of neglect , is it not time to build new American plants with modernized equipment and machinery ? This is the way to compete with other nations . We rebuilt Japan and Germany after World War II ; our policy now should be to rebuild our own country and end this artificially-created state of mass unemployment . <p> IRVING EIDENBERG <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> NO POLITICAL WILL <p> Editor  --  General Motors has announced a layoff of 74,000 autoworkers , and Mr. Bush has negotiated an agreement with Japan to increase U.S. auto imports from 5,000 cars in 1990 to 19,700 by 1995 . Problem solved  --  not quite . <p> Even if Japan dropped all restrictions on all auto imports we still would not be competitive . On a recent David Brinkley show an economic expert stated that U.S. automakers are not competitive with Japan . He said that Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower interest rates , ( 2 ) no pensions to pay for , and ( 3 ) no health-care costs . It is true that Japanese corporations pay high taxes as do ours , but their taxes pay for a good pension for every worker and health care for everyone . Our taxes are going mainly to the military and for interest on the huge debt created by 10 years of Reaganomics . <p> It appears that we are in the process of eating our industrial entrails . The real tragedy for America is that there seems to be no political will to face up to the reality of the $ 2.2 trillion additional debt given to us by Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush . <p> WAYNE LEWIS <p> San Andreas ( Calaveras County ) <p> . <p> THEM VS . US <p> Editor  --  Governor Wilson 's State of the State address was ugly . <p> It 's just plain wrong " to pit " the needs of very poor children ( i.e. , " welfare " families  --  two thirds of whom are children ) against the needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of California economic problems into a " them and us " type of argument . Where the " them " are cast as pernicious " tax receivers " and the " us " as morally justified , good folk . What has to be much more widely understood is that we 're all in this together and it 's our children at stake . <p> State Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti said it well : " You ca n't talk about increasing education ( funds ) for kids and at the same time tell the poorest of kids that they 're going to be in less secure homes because the grant . . . is going to be reduced " ( Chronicle , January 9 ) . <p> These poor children need the most help . . . in school and out of it , not increasing fiscal fear . Let 's hope Californians ' essential fairness and compassion surface , and fast ! <p> JOAN LESLIE <p> Orinda <p> . <p> BUDGET CUTS <p> Editor  --  Cutting AFDC by 25 percent will literally result in more homeless women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep public schools funded and " California competitive . " I say find other ways to cut the budget besides taking food out of struggling peoples ' mouths . I say Governor Wilson should start by taking a 25 percent pay cut and eliminating all taxpayer-funded job perks . <p> LISA SIKIE <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> BIKER VEGETABLES <p> Editor  --  It seems a lot of people are missing a major point of the new helmet law . Biker fatalities are of less concern to many taxpayers than biker vegetables . Everyone is arguing whether or not a biker should have the freedom to kill himself without a helmet . Reports show that many in biker accidents fall short of death and end up with severe brain and physical damage . Then they become the taxpayers ' burden . This is the reason nonbikers have a right to their say and the state has a right to the legislation ! <p> KIT MILLER <p> Danville <p> . <p> TRY DESALINATION <p> Editor  --  In the article , " State Facing Impasse Over Water " ( Chronicle , December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was nowhere any mention of building desalination plants at intervals along the coast to secure water from the Pacific . I believe that so doing would ensure a sufficient supply of water regardless of the whims of the weather , and at the same time , eliminate much of the conflicts mentioned in the article . Just a thought . <p> STEPHEN W. CAREY <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> GET SERIOUS , CAROLE <p> Editor  --  Carole Migden  --  the moppet headed duplicate of the 5- year-old Shirley Temple . Who can forget her association with the sanctuary of San Francisco ? Now Carole steps into the limelight again by proposing an ordinance which would deregulate dress codes  --  primarily earrings and tattoos . Oh Boy ! More picayune legislation ( Chronicle , January 13 ) . <p> Does n't Carole get it yet ? There are bigger , more important issues a majority of voters in the city want the Board of Supervisors to address . For her information , these issues wo n't take care of themselves as easily as a person 's appearance , so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child care , crime , the homeless and the filthy streets . Forget earrings and tattoos , Carole . Would you mind joining the city in which all of us live ? <p> MICHAEL N. MALONEY <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> CAVALIER ATTIUDE <p> Editor  --  Your article ( Chronicle , January 9 ) regarding former Mayor Art Agnos ' new job reveals another of the hidden costs of government in this state and the attitude of the people who control those funds . Perhaps Speaker Brown can not be held accountable for the existence of this job or the board , but to appoint his long-time ally to the position , based not on Agnos ' knowledge or ability but because , and I quote " He needs the job . He has a family to support . . . , " indicates to me a cavalier attitude which Brown and the rest of the Legislature , regardless of party affiliation , hold towards the voters in general and the tax monies specifically which they are entrusted with . While we 're at it , how come we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how many are there , to decide whether or not I should get my lousy $ 202 a week ? That 's right , I 'm unemployed , a San Francisco-born expatriate , writing from the desolation of Silicon Valley . After watching Art Agnos reshape the city into what his special-interest riddled brain believed San Francisco should be , I can only pray that I find a job before my unemployment runs out and I have to file for an extension . My , but the responsibilities of government weigh heavily on those who lead us through the vicissitudes of life ! <p> DANIEL BROSNAN <p> San Jose <p> . <p> ART 'S PART-TIME JOB <p> Editor  --  I do n't see anything wrong with Willie Brown giving a job to former Mayor Agnos as long as he is qualified to do the job . However , it is my understanding that this position is part-time ( 3 days a week ) . I believe that the average citizen would consider a salary of $ 92,460 for a part-time job excessive , especially when that citizen is paying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wonder the government is in such horrible shape . This action reinforces people 's lack of respect for politicians and screams out for fiscal responsibility and reform . <p> SCOTT BOYLE <p> San Francisco
