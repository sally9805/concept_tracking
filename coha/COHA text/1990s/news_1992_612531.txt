<p> When Gwen Torrence was barely old enough to walk , she 'd go into the store next door and demand candy . <p> But Gwen could n't talk very well and , said her mothter , Dorothy , " If they did n't give her what she wanted , she 'd get her big brother to go down and point it out . It would drive those clerks crazy . They 'd give her anything to get her out of the store .

" <p> " I tell her I 'm not going to be with her always , " said Dorothy Torrence . " She does n't like to hear that . " <p> Mrs. Torrence admits she has always spoiled Gwen from the day she was born . <p> On that day , Mrs. Torrence thought something was wrong with her newborn baby . She was n't allowed to see her . The umbilical cord had been wrapped around the baby 's neck and she was in an incubator . <p> " The first time I saw her , I looked into her eyes , and it looked like somethi ng was there , " said Mrs. Torrence .

Although he does n't train , Waller is still fast enough to beat her . His best time in the 100-meter is a wind-aided 10.11 seconds ; her best is 10.91 . <p> " It 's a big family thing , you know , " said Waller , who grew up in Eatonton , and whose parents chip in with babysitting duties . <p> Her biggest fan , though , may be " Little Man . " He shows her picture in magazines to visitors , even strangers . " This is Mommy running real fast , " he says . <p> If one of her videotapes is on , " he gets in his chair and watches it , " said Torrence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1996 Olympics . " When he 's at the track , he knows how to start me , by clapping two pieces of wood together . " <p> Torrence was back on the track a month after giving birth to her son . <p> Her international breakthrough came when she won the silver medal in the 1991 World Championships in the 100 and 200 meters behind Katrin Krabbe of Germany , who has announced she will not run in the Olympics in the wake of a drug-related suspension . <p> " A lot of people do n't realize how mentally tough she is and strong , " said her husband . " They look at her like a woman . I always say she 's a superwoman . " <p> Torrence was 3 or 4 when her father and mother separated , and he died a few years later . Her mother cleaned houses , and her stepfather was a construction worker . She has two brothers and two sisters . <p> She knows that she 's carrying her family 's dreams on legs so skinny she was once ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm in Warrenton , and was picked by her school to run at field day when she was in the seventh grade . " I could n't go ; I had to go to work in the fields , " said Mrs. Torrence . " That 's why I 'm so proud of Gwen running . " <p> " She 's not a stage mom , like some people 's mothers , " said Torrence . " She 's never been to practice . One day I 'd like her to come . I know she thinks I jog and stretch . I say , ' Mom , I hurt in practice . ' I 'd like for her to see why I 'm so tired out she has to cook my meals . " <p> Torrence 's oldest brother , Charles , who was paralyzed playing street football about 20 years ago , keeps a scrapbook of his baby sister 's accomplishments . <p> " He was crazy about sports , " said their mother , " and he always pulled for her and wanted her to run .

Before the 1988 Olympic Trials , she told him to hang up his spikes . <p> " I had to be very aggressive in telling him that he needed to get a job , " said Torrence . " It was really difficult to tell him because he did qualify for the trials . But we both could n't be broke . <p> " I think he was hurt by it , but he realized it was the best thing . You 've just got ta realize your talent . " <p> Torrence , named " Best Dressed " in high school , thought her talent lay in hair-dressing or clothes . Even today , the clothes spill over into the guest room closet - some with price tags still attached - and she spent " two arms , three legs and an ankle " on one sequined gown . <p> " I always wanted something good out of life because I did n't have it when I was young , " said Torrence , whose early years were spent at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply herself in school until her junior year . " Nobody told me I could make a difference , " said Torrence , who now makes motivational speeches at schools . " I was sassy . <p> " Everybody knew me by dressing or hair styles .

And he gave me a corsage . . . . After every race I lift my hands up in the air , and he gave me one to put on my arm . I could not believe my principal would pick me out of the whole school . " <p> Torrence was the first person in her family to attend college , though her motives for accepting the scholarship to Georgia were suspect . <p> " Oooh , Herschel Walker , I 'm going to marry him , " she said . <p> She never met Walker , meeting Waller instead .

" She gets so nervous sometimes , you 'll think she 's a little kid running her first race . " <p> But she 's come a long way . <p> " The ultimate would be to be in the stadium when she wins the gold , " said Waller . " She 'll look up there and say , ' Baby , we finally did it .
