For thousands of Chinese citizens , the massacre in Tiananmen Square marked a personal turning point , irrevocably changing their lives and forcing them to make choices they had never had to contemplate . That was true for student leaders like Wuer Kaixi , who headed Beijing 's banned independent union of students . It was also true for intellectuals like Zhou Duo , who spent more than ten months in jail before being released three weeks ago , and for officials like Xu Jiatun , who supported conciliation with the protesters and mysteriously turned up in California this month for an extended stay in the U.S. Their stories : <P> THE STUDENT <P> With his handsome face and suave demeanor , Wuer Kaixi was the obvious choice as poster boy of the overseas democracy movement after he escaped from the mainland nearly a year ago . Since then , however , the young dissident has lost some of his hero 's aura , and his rumored peccadilloes  --  spending dissident funds on a lavish lobster dinner , faking illness during press conferences to avoid tough questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been well chronicled in the press . But he is the wiser for it . " It was hard , but that 's what press freedom is all about , " Wuer , 22 , said cheerfully last week in Paris , where he lives . " No one gets away with anything . " <P> Though Wuer enrolled at Harvard last fall , he dropped out in February , in part to focus full time on his role as vice president of the Paris-based Federation for Democracy in China . He had hoped to join the Goddess of Democracy and take part in broadcasting pro-democracy messages into China from nearby international waters . But fearing for Wuer 's safety , the project 's organizers balked , and now that the ship has been sequestered by anxious authorities in Taiwan , they plan to sell it off . <P> Wuer remains resolutely optimistic about his country 's future . " Events in Europe and in the Soviet Union have proved that when the people are determined , the government must give in , " he says . But he recognizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recently , Wuer received unconfirmed reports that his father , a Communist Party member , had been placed under house arrest in Beijing . <P> THE INTELLECTUAL <P> When sociologist Zhou Duo heard that the tanks were rumbling toward Tiananmen Square , where he had been on a hunger strike to show solidarity with the students , his first thought was to wave a white flag . But he dismissed the idea as ignoble . Instead , Zhou , 43 , and popular singer Hou Dejian approached the oncoming soldiers and negotiated an agreement that allowed the demonstrators to withdraw peacefully . <P> Three days later , Zhou went into hiding after he learned that the innovative Stone Corp. , the computer firm he had worked for as a policy planner , had become the target of a witch-hunt . Its president , Wan Runnan , now a leading dissident in exile in Paris , had been close to then party chief Zhao Ziyang and an ardent supporter of the students .                   @ @
