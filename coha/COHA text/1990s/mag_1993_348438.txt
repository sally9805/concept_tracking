FINALLY , PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON HAS UNVEILED a program not likely to be controversial : a $300 million initiative to spur vaccinations against childhood diseases . About half of U.S. two-year-olds have not received all their shots ; in the western hemisphere , only Bolivia and Haiti have poorer records . The money will create a national system to keep track of immunizations and will enable public clinics to work longer hours and buy more vaccines . Clinton stopped short , though , of a $700 million proposal to guarantee free shots to all kids . <P> The drive to immunize is a priority of Hillary Rodham Clinton 's . At a conference in Pennsylvania , the First Lady chided drug firms for raising vaccine prices more than tenfold since 1981 . The next day President Clinton echoed that theme , charging drugmakers with seeking " profits at the expense of our children . " The companies say high prices result from product-liability suits aimed at the industry .                    @
