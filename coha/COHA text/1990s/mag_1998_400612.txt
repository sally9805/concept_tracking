A little pampering can make your feet look and feel fabulous . // Leonardo da Vinci called the foot " a masterpiece of engineering and a work of art . " It has 26 bones , 33 separate joints and moves in an infinite variety of ways : flexing and flattening , pointing and springing . When we walk , feet valiantly soak up our body 's weight with each step . If we go jogging , they absorb even more-up to four times our weight . Most of us take about 10,000 strides each day ; in a lifetime , that 's the equivalent of four laps around the world . Yet , we often overlook all that hard work , unless , of course , our feet ache . " When our feet hurt , " said Socrates , " we hurt all over . " Foot problems are not normal , nor do they have to be tolerated . Unsightly calluses and corns , itchy fungal infections , embarrassing odor and continual pain are all signs that something is amiss and should be ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of foot pain , according to the American Podiatric Medical Association in Bethesda , Md . Women have roughly four times the trouble with their feet as men do , thanks to the shoes we wear . " Probably the most common and preventable cause of foot pain is footwear , " confirms Robert H. Leland , M.D. , assistant professor of orthopedic surgery and a foot specialist at Wayne State University in Detroit . But it 's not just spike heels and slingbacks that cause the laundry list of ailments , including hammer and claw toes , bunions and bumpy heel growths known variously as Haglund 's deformity , bone spurs , boot bite and pump bump . Any shoes , even the most orthopedic-looking Doc Maartens or Birkenstocks , can create problems if they do n't fit right ( see " If the Shoe Fits , " p. 106 ) . Keeping feet healthy is the key to keeping the rest of the body healthy . " Your feet are your foundation , " explains Gary Spencer , D.P.M. , a holistic podiatrist in Renton , Wash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spine and throughout the rest of your body . " Problems , such as back or knee pain may , in fact , be related to your feet 's shape and structure . A podiatrist can prescribe orthotics , custom-made shoe inserts , to compensate for the foot 's failings . While shoes account for most foot ailments , they do n't carry all the blame . Standing for long hours , straining your muscles , picking up a fungus in a public shower , even cutting your toenails incorrectly can all tax your feet and make them ache . The good news is a little TLC and the following natural remedies will go a long way toward keeping your feet in top shape . Athlete 's Foot This itching , burning , scaling condition comes from a fungus that thrives in warm , moist areas . Foot sprays or powders that contain tea tree oil , a potent antimicrobial and antifungal native to Australia , not only fight the fungus but also help keep feet clean and dry . Blisters Friction and pressure cause these small , fluid-filled pouches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're getting them , try wearing another pair of shoes or opt for two layers of socks to cushion your foot and to prevent friction ( the socks rub against each other instead of your foot ) . For large or painful blisters , Spencer advises using a sterilized needle to make a small hole at the edge of the blister , then gently " milk " the fluid out . Do not cut away the skin . Clean the area thoroughly , spray with tea tree oil , then bandage . Consult your doctor if you notice signs of infection , such as redness and swelling . Calluses These are thickened , often painful , patches of skin that form on heels , toes and other areas when shoes rub against bony places . If you 've developed calluses , determine which shoes are causing them and check them for spots that might be rubbing . It may be time to replace the insoles or retire the shoes altogether . To remove calluses , try this remedy recommended by Spencer : First , make a foot bath by dissolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two gallons of warm water . Soak your feet for 10 minutes , then dry them thoroughly . Next , rub rough areas with a natural pumice stone or foot file . ( Never attempt to cut off a callus . ) Finally , apply a rich cream . If you do this at night , lavish on a little extra , put on some cotton socks and let the cream work overnight . In the morning , your feet will feel refreshed . This night-time treatment ( minus the soak and pumice stone rub ) is especially soothing for cracked heels . Fatigued Feet Nothing beats cooling , invigorating peppermint . Dunk your feet in a basin of warm water that contains 15 drops of peppermint essential oil . Foot sprays also give you a refreshing lift . To make a spray : Mix 5 drops of peppermint essential oil with 5 drops of rosemary essential oil ( which stimulates circulation ) in 4 ounces of witch hazel . Pour into a glass bottle with a spray top and use as needed . Commercial foot soaks and sprays can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tight foot muscles can cause discomfort and even deformities , such as hammer toes . " Some people develop a muscle imbalance in which the big muscles in the leg overpower the little muscles in the foot , " explains Leland . He recommends this stretch to keep foot muscles supple : While standing , push your toes down and into the floor . Hold the stretch for 10 seconds , then relax and repeat on the opposite foot . Repeat up to 20 times on each foot . Photograph // If the bottoms of your heels hurt , try stretching the Achilles tendons . With your palms at shoulder height , press against a wall . Keep one knee straight while you bend the other and push your hips forward , keeping both heels flat on the floor . When you feel a stretch in your heel and arch , hold the position for 10 seconds , then relax and straighten up . Repeat 20 times for each foot .

To really pamper your feet , release tension and improve circulation , try massage . You can practice basic reflexology-the stimulation of various points on the sole of the foot related to different parts of the body-simply by rubbing your feet gently for a few minutes , says Viv Johnson , a reflexologist and massage therapist in Winter Park , Fla . For a relaxing do-it-yourself reflexology session , apply your favorite foot cream or massage oil and use slow and firm strokes , concentrating on any areas that feel sore . Nail Ailments Avoid ingrown toenails ( when the nail grows into the surrounding skin and causes an infection ) by clipping them straight across , leaving nails a bit longer than the tips of your toes . Never trim your toenails on the sides . If you think you 're developing an ingrown nail , Leland suggests pushing the skin back and away from the nail . If you already have an ingrown nail , consult a health-care practitioner about removing it . Cuticles are important barriers against infection , so keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuticles get ragged and the surrounding skin rips , providing easy access for disease-causing germs . Never cut cuticles . Instead , gently push them back when they 're soft ( after bathing ) and moisturize with sesame oil or vitamin E ( squeeze the liquid out of a capsule ) . Perspiration and Odor Your feet have approximately 250,000 sweat glands , which excrete as much as half a pint of moisture each day . For especially sweaty or smelly feet , try using cypress essential oil , which serves as both an antiperspirant and as an odor-fighting antimicrobial . Laurel Vukovic , an herbalist in Ashland , Ore. , recommends adding 15 drops of cypress oil to a basin of warm water and soaking your feet for 10 minutes . You also can make a cypress splash by diluting 5 drops of cypress oil in a tablespoon of witch hazel ; apply directly as needed . Foot problems are easily treated , but if they persist , do n't hesitate to go to a podiatrist .
