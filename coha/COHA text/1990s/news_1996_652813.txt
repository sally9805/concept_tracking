<p> ONE MORNING 12 YEARS AGO , a celebrated stage and film director , an award-winning playwright , a hot young director from Chicago and a wealthy patron of the arts gathered for breakfast at the Carlyle Hotel in New York to ponder a question that had bedeviled the theater world for years : Could that perennial basket case of the American stage , the Vivian Beaumont Theater , be saved ? <p> It was not an issue of landmark preservation but of artistic rescue . The Beaumont , which opened in 1965 as a component of the sprawling Lincoln Center complex , was widely regarded as a failure . By that morning in the fall of 1984 , it had been dark for four years , its financial reserves depleted . A bitter dispute had erupted among its critics and Beaumont officials over management of the theater , which not only had ceased to be discussed as America 's answer to the National Theater in London but had such a vast , unconventional space  --  a combination thrust and proscenium stage  --  that many directors and designers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Carlyle four  --  Mike Nichols , David Mamet , Gregory Mosher and Linda Janklow , at the time a member of the Beaumont board , and now its chairwoman  --  hashed out scenarios for reviving the Beaumont . " I basically said , ' Have I lost my mind , or is there any hope for this theater ? ' " Ms. Janklow recalled recently . <p> The meeting , in a sense , was the beginning of another era for the Beaumont , an era that has seen the cavernous theater and its smaller Lincoln Center sister , the Mitzi E. Newhouse , move from the theatrical backwater into the forefront of American theater . It set in motion events that would bring a new team of administrators , artists and benefactors to the renamed Lincoln Center Theater , and make it what it is today : the pre-eminent institutional theater in the country , a theater with a slew of critical hits to its credit , a $25 million annual budget and a membership of 41,000 playgoers so devoted that there is a waiting list of 12,000 names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its latest phase on Nov. 6 , when the Beaumont , long criticized for its acoustical dead spots and neck-crimping sightlines , reopens after a 10-month , $6.2 million renovation with " Juan Darien : A Carnival Mass . " The production , a music-theater piece using masks and puppetry , is a reworked version of a show by the director Julie Taymor and the composer Elliot Goldenthal that was first presented in New York in 1988 . <p> The restoration project , the most ambitious overhaul of the 1,050-seat theater in its 30-year history , included replacing the Beaumont 's ventilation systems , lighting grid and air conditioning , remodeling bathrooms and ramps for the handicapped and improving the acoustics with a new $500,000 sound system . The Mitzi Newhouse is currently undergoing its own less costly refurbishment and will reopen in February with Craig Lucas 's " God 's Heart . " <p> Architecturally , the two theaters will look much the same . Still , the project is more than a construction job . It is further evidence of the resuscitation of an institution once given up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupies in the cultural life of the city , a role it was always meant to have . <p> Now , having stabilized its finances and cemented its reputation , Lincoln Center Theater must come to grips with a larger question : What kind of theater is it going to be ? This is an age when audiences look increasingly to the nonprofit theater for original work , when big institutions like the Joseph Papp Public Theater and the Manhattan Theater Club seek to be players on Broadway . Will Lincoln Center Theater choose to become even more commercial , or will it use its money and power to become the leading creative force in the nation for new theater ? <p> More than three decades ago , when the producer Robert Whitehead and the director Elia Kazan were first given the mandate to create a Lincoln Center Repertory Theater , the vision was of a theater with a permanent company of actors that would perform the classics and new American plays . That was never truly to be . <p> Lincoln Center Theater has indeed presented new works by writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jon Robin Baitz , and it has instituted a widely praised training program for young directors . But it has not evolved into a repertory company or a purveyor of the classics in the mode of a traditional national theater . Oddly enough , the theater , a nonprofit giant , has made a name for itself replicating the producing pattern of Broadway , as a hitmaker . <p> OVER THE LAST DECADE , Lincoln Center Theater has compiled a track record unparalleled in contemporary American theater . Other major nonprofit institutions in New York , like the Roundabout Theater Company , the Manhattan Theater Club and the Joseph Papp Public Theater , have had standout productions . But none rival Lincoln Center for consistent success . Each one of its biggest hits has been a defining theatrical event of its season . Among them : " The House of Blue Leaves " ( 1986 ) ; " Anything Goes " and " Sarafina ! " ( 1987 ) ; " Speed-the-Plow " ( 1988 ) ; " Six Degrees of Separation " ( 1990 ) ; " The Sisters Rosensweig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and " The Heiress " ( 1995 ) . <p> The hits have translated into financial success . Lincoln Center Theater earns about 75 percent of its budget at the box office  --  an extraordinarily high percentage for a nonprofit theater . Between $6 and $8 million is raised annually by the theater 's board of directors , which is widely regarded as one of the most committed and active theater boards in the city . <p> Wendy Wasserstein , whose long association with Andre Bishop , the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater , goes back to the days when he held the same job at Playwrights Horizons , said that in her view Lincoln Center had come to serve many of the functions of a national theater . Lincoln Center , she said , " occupies that space and says , ' We 're equal to the opera , to the ballet , ' and that plays do n't have to be done in a 200-seat house . I think it 's important to be working at a theater that is both going to have Gerald Gutierrez doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The praise for the quality of the theater 's productions is nearly universal . Still , the admiration is sometimes tempered by complaints . Many Broadway producers , for example , say they resent the competition that the nonprofit theater has posed by producing crowd-pleasing musicals , like the revivals of " Anything Goes " ( which ran for two years at the Beaumont ) and " Carousel . " The theater is also criticized for its recently acquired habit of staging British plays , like Tom Stoppard 's " Hapgood " and " Arcadia " and David Hare 's " Racing Demon " in an institution founded , in part , to champion American work . <p> And there is a feeling among some in the theater world that even with its high-powered , 35-member board and deep pockets , Lincoln Center Theater is locked into a hit mentality , directing its resources away from riskier ventures . Fearful of offending Lincoln Center Theater officials  --  the theater world is too small for those who inhabit it to make a powerful enemy  --  virtually no one will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't been a new American play on their mainstage since ' My Favorite Year , ' " said one New York theater official who insisted on anonymity . It was a reference to the original 1992 musical that opened in the Beaumont to disappointing reviews and closed after 81 performances . " It 's fascinating how much they do old tried-and-true work . " In addition to " Juan Darien , " a revival of " The Little Foxes " will be the other Beaumont production this season . <p> Some criticism comes from no less an authority than Mr. Mosher , who left at the end of 1991 after seven years as artistic director in partnership with Bernard Gersten , who became executive producer of the theater in 1985 and remains in the job today . Mr. Mosher , who was succeeded by Mr. Bishop , says he departed mostly out of boredom and frustration with what he perceived to be the theater 's growing complacency and lack of daring . <p> " When there is something to conserve , people become conservative , " said Mr. Mosher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled Circle in the Square . " The theater became known for being successful rather than for any number of other things . " <p> Mr. Mosher said he had contributed to the hit mentality with casting decisions involving megastars : Madonna was cast in Mr. Mamet 's " Speed-the-Plow , " and Steve Martin and Robin Williams were paired in Samuel Beckett 's " Waiting for Godot . " <p> As a result of all the publicity and success , he said , the theater 's connection to racially diverse and younger audiences was sacrificed . " It could have been known as the theater of $10 tickets , " he said . " It could have become known for presenting African plays , " like " Sarafina ! " <p> Margo Lion , a commercial theater producer who has worked on such high-profile Broadway productions as " Jelly 's Last Jam " and " Angels in America , " said she has nothing but admiration for Lincoln Center Theater 's work . But she laments being unable to compete with the theater 's vast resources . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " They have a subscription base ; they 're extremely well funded . It 's just a very enviable position . If I were Tom Stoppard , what would be the advantage of going to a commercial venue ? So the only question becomes , ' Is it yet another nail in the coffin of the independent producer ? ' " <p> There is , it seems , an outsize pressure on Lincoln Center Theater to be all things to all theater people : to be both theatrical innovator and curator , to be a house of hits and an incubator for emerging talent . The high expectations may be partly due to the leadership vacuum that Lincoln Center Theater has been compelled to fill . The enfeebled commercial theater , confining itself largely to big-budget musicals and the occasional mainstream play , has a fairly narrow mission these days ; while most institutional theaters are consumed with the basic problems of survival . <p> Lincoln Center Theater 's current proprietors , Mr. Gersten and Mr. Bishop , say they are aware of the pressures and gripes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of performers , authors and directors like Mbongeni Ngema , James Lapine and Graciela Daniele , as evidence of Lincoln Center 's big tent . ( And not all of the theater 's productions are hits : last year 's " Chronicle of a Death Foretold , " an original musical it produced on Broadway , was another disappointment , and this month , Mr. Durang 's " Sex and Longing , " produced by Lincoln Center Theater at the Cort Theater , was widely panned . ) <p> MR . GERSTEN AND Mr. Bishop , who have become nearly inseparable in public  --  they even read alternate lines of their acceptance speech for the Tony Award for best revival last season for " A Delicate Balance "  --  argue that they have a big mission , one that they are trying to enlarge even further . Mr. Bishop says he wants to create a repertory company of accomplished American actors for a season of the classics . And Mr. Gersten argues that it is only after Lincoln Center Theater shows the way with a play or musical that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the fact , everyone wanted to do ' Anything Goes , ' " Mr. Gersten said , adding that he has no problem with any producer who can steal a play or performer away . " If they want Craig Lucas or Wendy Wasserstein , outbid us ! " he declared . " Use power . Use influence . Use anything ! " <p> Mr. Bishop , a soft-spoken and professorial counterpart to the ebullient Mr. Gersten , dismisses the complaints about commercialism . " I think Lincoln Center does a great variety of work . But if you told me that ' The Heiress ' revival , with zero advance interest in it , would turn out to be commercial , people would have said you were crazy . " <p> The theater has , in fact , regularly employed many of the most admired people in the business , from the director Jerry Zaks to the actor Philip Bosco . Many who have worked there say the experience has been among the most rewarding of their careers . <p> " Yes , anyone could have done ' A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed the play , as well as " The Heiress , " on Broadway for Lincoln Center Theater and won Tony Awards for both . " But the fact is , nobody else did . And no one else would have done it with as much care . " <p> One afternoon in early fall , Mr. Gersten , an eternally boyish , 71-year-old former protege of Joseph Papp , was showing off the final stages of the Beaumont refurbishment when he came to the makeshift box office in the theater 's dusty lobby . <p> " Tomorrow , we 'll sell 10,000 tickets to ' Juan Darien , ' " he predicted , referring to the first day of sales for the show . How could he be so certain ? " Past history , " he said . ( The box office opens to members before the general public , and they are a reliable group of ticket buyers . ) <p> Lincoln Center Theater 's robustness is reflected in the popularity of its widely copied membership strategy : it costs $35 to join for the season , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial bargain in a city where a ticket for an Off Broadway play can reach $45 and where the most expensive seats at a Broadway musical can be $75 . <p> It was all a measure of how far the Beaumont had come . Ten years earlier , Mr. Gersten and Mr. Mosher had decided to move John Guare 's " House of Blue Leaves , " their first hit , from the 299-seat Newhouse to the Beaumont . The play had enlivened the smaller theater and revived Mr. Guare 's reputation . And now it was to do the same for the Beaumont  --  indeed for theater in general at Lincoln Center . <p> " It just blew the audience away , " Mr. Gersten said of the play 's first night in the larger house . " The laughter that followed purged all the ghosts that had haunted the Beaumont all those years . "
