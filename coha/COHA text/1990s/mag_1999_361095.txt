I 'm an avid reader of PEOPLE , but until a few weeks ago , I did n't know what Mavis Leno looked like . The wife of Jay Leno is an aggressive homebody , and for all the outside world knew of her , she might as well have been wrapped in a burka , the full-body shroud Afghan women are forced to wear . But she 's emerged to give voice to those very women . " Silence , " she says , " is killing " the women of Afghanistan , where the Taliban , an extreme faction of mujahedin , largely composed of Lord of the Flies-like boy soldiers , swept to power in 1996 . Women , who made up 40% of doctors and 70% of teachers in the capital , were forced to abandon Western clothes and stay indoors behind windows painted black " for their own good . " If they show any skin or go outside without a male relative , they risk death . Women ca n't be treated by male doctors , yet women are n't allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> So now each day Leno drives to the cramped offices of the Feminist Majority Foundation in her blue BMW in which the red engine light keeps coming on ( she says Jay coddles only his vintage cars ) . She recruited Linda Bloodworth-Thomason ( creator of Designing Women ) to help grab attention for Afghan women . Together , they battled compassion fatigue to mount a $150- per-head buffet dinner with more than 100 A-list names . Despite Leno 's spending 12-hour days on the phone , performers and guests were dropping out days before the March 29 event ( " You mean Sally Field 's not coming ? Well , then count me out " ) . Then , at breakfast on the Thursday before the gala , Jay told Mavis , " Guess who 's going to be on the show tonight ? You are . " Her first ( " and last , " she adds ) appearance gave the event the final push it needed . Lionel Richie opened . Lily Tomlin joked . Marlo Thomas introduced . Sidney Poitier spoke . All the Judds came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to Mavis . In a roomful of women , he said , it was embarrassing that " the only one crying was the guy . " <P> Now 's the moment for the dry-eyed journalist to note that Jay would ordinarily be making late-night mincemeat out of himself and others present like Geena Davis , Kathy Bates , Loni Anderson and Xena Warrior Princess . Hollywood often sets itself up for ridicule . ( Remember Jessica Lange testifying on the farm crisis because she played a farmer 's wife ? ) But is n't it better to use your fame for something other than getting a table at Spago Beverly Hills ? Mavis has been criticized as misinformed by a tiny but noisy pro-Taliban lobby , whose frequent spokesperson is Laili Helms , the Afghan-born daughter-in-law of former CIA chief Richard Helms . Its protest outside the party was menacing enough so that Jennifer Holliday ( Dreamgirls ) was too shaken to perform . Helms , who lives freely in a New Jersey suburb , is convinced the Taliban is good for Afghanistan and that life is better now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
