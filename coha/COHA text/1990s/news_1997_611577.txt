<p> Eight years after the collapse of Communist rule , Poles are still on the lookout for the Big Lie . <p> After one botched witch hunt and a half-dozen attempts since to design laws to ferret out former secret agents , Poland has embarked on a quest to identify onetime Communist collaborators . With parliamentary elections one month away , the effort may make for a political season unlike anything this young democracy has seen . <p> Under a law that took effect this month , candidates for Parliament must declare in writing if they were ever secret informers or collaborated with secret police in the Soviet-style regime that manacled Poland for four decades . <p> There is no chance anyone will go to jail for admitting to being a toady for a hated dictatorship . Instead , candidates face the wrath of an electorate that will be handed ballots noting office-seekers ' admissions of collaboration . <p> Another serious reckoning comes after the Sept. 21 election . Newly elected officials  --  and incumbents such as President Aleksander Kwasniewski , a former Communist  --  face a judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be chosen this fall , will review their cases and those of other top officials , and decide if any of them lied about the past . <p> Stakes are high for those who are proved liars ; they will be banned from elected and appointive office for 10 years . <p> The Polish experiment is the latest of several controversial attempts in Eastern Europe to come to grips with its Communist past . The debate over who should pay the price of tyranny in Poland has resonated in every election campaign since this nation of 38 million went to the polls in partially free elections in 1989 . <p> Opinion polls show the public largely supports attempts to confront some hard questions  --  particularly since the electoral victory by former Communists in 1993 . No one doubts that the law will sharpen old pain ; the question is whether the experience of looking back will help heal or will deepen decades-old wounds . <p> " The reality is , in these countries , they probably have to do something to address the issue , " said Neil Kritz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice , " published by Washington 's U.S. Institute of Peace . " But nobody 's figured out a good way to do it . " <p> This summer , Hungary too is beginning to enforce a law aimed at scrutinizing how and why certain people  --  most notably , elected officials  --  served secret police agencies in its past . Other countries , such as Czechoslovakia , moved years ago to try to root out Communist operatives . <p> The Czechoslovak Parliament voted in 1991 to ban persons from office based on rank and association within the Communist Party and on accusations found in secret police files . Politicians confronted with evidence were given the choice of disappearing quietly from the political scene or , in essence , being exposed . <p> Today , the process in what is now the Czech Republic continues as individual citizens are allowed to request a glimpse of their own files . <p> Screening  --  formally known as lustration , a term that connotes ritual purification  --  has been a much debated method of justice . Although such laws were meant to prevent secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new democracies , human rights organizations decried the methods and the scope of the Czech law , as well as those enacted in Germany and Bulgaria . <p> The process wrongly imposed guilt by association , human rights groups said . Also , the laws and files that formed the basis for retribution were sometimes used for political gain . <p> In some cases , dissidents of the 1960s were tarred by allegations that effectively eliminated them from political office in the 1990s . In other well-publicized episodes , men who fought Communist rule were hounded out of post-Communist legislatures based on secret files  --  despite their protests that the files contained lies or misrepresentations . <p> Poland suffered through one such form of political manipulation in 1992 . Interior Minister Antoni Macierewicz released to Parliament a list of alleged collaborators that included opponents of then-Prime Minister Jan Olszewski . The list , put together by a team of apparently untested and untrained investigators , was exposed as full of inaccuracies . The Olszewski government was broadly criticized and fell . <p> After some tortuous debate , the current Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the public servants themselves ; it is a truth test for today 's officials . But the process is jeopardized by the very files that hold the secrets . No one disputes that the secret police files are incomplete and were vulnerable to manipulation in the first years of Poland 's shift to democracy . <p> Those files , however , will be the basis for judicial review . Judges will have to investigate and decide just what to believe from the files  --  and how disputes can , if ever , be fairly handled . Persons who possess secret files and refuse to hand them to the court are the only ones liable for imprisonment under the law . <p> Deficiencies in the law are apparent even to some of its supporters . The definition of collaboration is not clear . There is no distinction between those who wanted to hurt democratic opponents of Poland 's Communist government and those who were forced to cooperate with it . <p> The law does not define which files are to be used for review or where the files are now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his or her own files . In addition , judges on the 21-member review commission must be approved by the justice minister . They apparently must also be screened , but there are no criteria for that process . <p> Timing remains murky . The law specifies no timetable for charges . So far , of the 6,659 candidates running for the 460 seats in Poland 's lower house and 519 running for 100 Senate seats , 11 have identified themselves as collaborators . <p> As the law reads , the judicial commission will have to review all candidates ' cases once the election is over . All members of Parliament , the president , high-level appointees , thousands of judges and prosecutors and heads of influential state-run agencies , such as Polish radio and television , will come under the microscope . <p> Political parties have taken clear sides on the issue . The Democratic Left , a coalition of ex-Communist parties that Kwasniewski helped form , strongly opposed the law . Opposition groups supported it . The president , who had previously opposed the law , said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do more harm than good . " The law went into effect Aug. 3 . <p> One of the first candidates to demonstrate quirks in this massive truth-telling exercise was Jerzy Szteliga , 44 , a former head of the Communist Party for the town of Opole , in southern Poland . <p> Even before he had to sign his candidate 's voucher , Szteliga called a news conference to announce that he , in fact , had a past . He would not specify what that was , but he said he would be defined as a collaborator under the law . <p> Szteliga bet that his constituents would not be repulsed by his admission . " What should I be ashamed of ? That at a certain time , in a certain place , I did what I thought was helpful ? I never murdered anyone . I never hurt anyone . I did what I thought was correct , " he said in an interview in Opole . <p> But this admission also allows voters to consider another statement by Szteliga , made in 1993 . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar form , one that was not legally binding . In that , he said he had never collaborated with secret agents . <p> How can Szteliga explain that apparent lie to voters ? " Well , I would n't call that a lie , " Szteliga said with a smile . " I would call that a lie-oriented statement . "
