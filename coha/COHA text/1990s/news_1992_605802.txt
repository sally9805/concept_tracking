<p> There was nothing to indicate that this would be the day that Ann Williams 's life would turn upside down . <p> She rose early for work and put on a tailored dress and understated jewelry . As she did each morning , she went into her 16-year-old son 's room , decorated with pictures of him playing in the park , graduating from junior high , snorkeling in Florida . <p> She woke him up for school and gave him $ 2 for lunch . Before she left home , she called out her usual , " Love ya . Love ya . " <p> Hours later , just before taking a lunch break , she would get the phone call that still rings in her ears : " We have your son . He 's been shot . " <p> When she saw him again , he was in the emergency room at Children 's Hospital , his shoulder torn by five gaping wounds inflicted by a blast from a 12-gauge shotgun . Her son looked up at her from an operating table and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the gunfire came from or why he was shot . <p> The truth is that he never went to school that September morning in 1990 . Police would tell her that her son had been shot in a Southeast Washington parking lot . He was selling drugs . <p> The near-fatal shooting 16 months ago exposed a relationship built on a mother 's trust and a teenager 's lies . <p> Until then , Williams believed that her love , lectures and discipline  --  an approach that had worked for her parents  --  had kept her son out of trouble . <p> But when her son left home , he stepped into a different world  --  one that offered young people ready access to stolen cars , drugs and guns . He began to embrace that world while still in junior high school , always careful to cover his tracks . <p> With the shooting , Williams said , " The blinders came off . " <p> While organizations and the District government search for ways to prevent more young people from being lured into a world of drugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a year in a private struggle to save one teenager , her son . <p> " It is a totally different ballgame when it hits home , " she said . " You do n't really know what to do . " <p> Williams does not know whether she has won back her son . In fact , she is concerned that his life still may be in danger , and spoke only on the conditions that her children not be identified and that she be referred to by her maiden name . Certain other specifics have been left out to protect the identities . <p> Williams , who once condemned the parents of " busy boys " involved in drugs and violence , now displays a certain sense of guilt . But she offers an explanation for failing to understand earlier signs of trouble . <p> " Even if you are educated , you still see your children in the way you want to see them . You are a parent from the heart , and there are some things you do n't want to see , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born eight years after her first , in many ways she gave him the kind of intense attention parents often lavish on a firstborn . <p> Even after he grew into a strapping , 265-pound young man , " I saw my baby , " she said . " I saw the youngest and that sweet smile and baby face . " <p> When he attended his first go-go dance at the age of 14 , he was already nearly six feet tall . Concerned about tales of violence at such gatherings , she drove him there , introduced herself to the security guard and told him to watch her baby . <p> " Lady , your baby is as big as me , " the shocked officer replied . <p> That perception of his innocence is one of the many things that changed the day of the shooting . <p> " I did n't know the child who got shot , " she said . <p> " He betrayed my trust , " she added bitterly . " Every time I looked at his wounds , I got sick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did this to me . ' Part of me is messed up , and I 'll never let him forget . " <p> Her son , on the other hand , returned to school a celebrity . Ballou High School students surrounded him and pleaded to see his wounds . <p> " I would say it ai n't nothing to see , " he said . " Most of them think I was real lucky because it was a 12-gauge pump . I felt I was important because I got shot , and I know that 's dumb . " <p> He still says he does not know why he was shot by the young man who drew the shotgun from beneath an ankle-length coat and fired without bothering to aim . <p> Asked what effect the shooting had , he replies : " I pick my friends now . If somebody says , ' Let 's go to the park , ' I 'm careful to make sure nobody is setting me up . " <p> Before the shooting , he chaffed under his mother 's rules . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't need anybody keeping a leash on me , " he said . " She would be saying , ' Where are you going ? How long you gon na stay ? ' " <p> The shooting , he said , made him realize his behavior could get him killed . It also made him understand the restrictions . His mother , he added , " does n't have any reason to worry now . " <p> When he shows signs of forgetting the lesson by pouting or acting defiant , she is quick to remind him . <p> " Ring ring ring , " she says in words dripping with sarcasm . " Hello , Mrs. Williams . This is Children 's Hospital . We have your son . He 's been shot . . . . " <p> Williams 's life always revolved around her two children . While her older son pursued his passion for sports and left home for a prestigious California college , the younger became both son and friend . The two turned zoo trips into adventures . They went to the movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kids do n't go to the movies with their mothers anymore . " <p> At about age 8 , he told her he wanted to be an engineer and once unexpectedly said to her , " I do n't know what I would do if I ever lost you . " <p> Not long after that , Williams had to answer questions about his father 's absence and find the least hurtful way to explain that his father had been sentenced on drug-related charges . He said he understood when she warned him to stay away from anyone with drugs . <p> By the time he was 10 , all of the men in the household had departed . His father was in a corrections facility . His uncle enrolled in a drug treatment program . His grandfather died , and his brother entered college . <p> Williams tried to enroll him in the Big Brothers program , which matches boys with role models . He was furious . He argued that he had a big brother and that he still had a father . <p> As for the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " I was going to miss all of them , but it was n't like I was talking to them about problems . " <p> His mother insisted that he go to the Police Boys and Girls Clubs summer camps , and she put him in a short-term boot camp designed to teach young boys discipline . <p> His first and only arrest came at age 14 , when he skipped school with a friend , hid his books under a truck parked in an alley and caught a bus to Wheaton Plaza , where the two got arrested for stealing a Walkman . <p> " My friend stole the main part , " he now explains . " I just had the earphones . You could get those anywhere . " <p> Williams says that " stupid " incident is evidence of her son 's main problem . He is , she says , a born follower . <p> " He never wanted to be Jesse James , " she said . " He just wanted to hold his coat . " <p> Although a judge dismissed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She persuaded a corrections officer to lock him in jail for about an hour . She took him to a halfway house where juvenile offenders decried their past behavior . She tried to take him to see the " cool kids " in the morgue , but the medical examiner said no . <p> " It did n't do nothing but make me mad , " he said . <p> The next clue that something was amiss came months later , during a summer outing to a city recreation pool . A young man yelling something about a drug debt threatened her son . He told his mother he had never seen the guy before . <p> " I believed my son , not a total stranger , " she said . " I knew that my child knew better , and I told him to just stay away from those bad boys . " <p> But the pool incident prompted Williams 's sister and older son to warn her to keep a closer eye on him . <p> She watched for unexplained money and never saw any . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither . And she watched to make sure he did not hang out with large groups of youths . <p> " I was a little frightened , " Williams said . " I had preached against drugs , but I would n't have known what to do . I told myself I had been a good mother , and those kinds of problems did n't happen to good mothers . I did n't want to listen , and I saw what I wanted to see . " <p> Still , she continued to question him . Why did so many teenagers in a known drug area greet her son by name when she stopped the car at a traffic light ? Just guys from school , he replied . <p> The friends he brought home seemed " too slick , " even though they were always extremely polite . <p> " I did n't know what to do about his friends , " she said . " I had no proof , and you do n't want to push him away too much . You want him to bring his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shooting , when she decided to search her son 's room . She was looking for a missing diamond pinkie ring that he had denied taking . She lifted the mattress and found crack cocaine . <p> When the youth returned home , his older brother searched his pockets and found more crack and the missing pinkie ring . <p> Williams , crying hysterically , picked up a drumstick and began hitting her son . Her older son punched his brother over and over with his fists . <p> " I was thinking , ' Why our family ? " said the older son , who had moved back from California . " This happens to ghetto families , to low-income people . Why was it happening to us ? I tried to kick his butt . I figured if I did n't make him see that he had to stop , those young guys would pull a trigger on him . " <p> Later , he talked to his brother about choosing better friends , and still distrustful , for months afterward sometimes searched his brother 's pockets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was sorry and insisted that the drugs his mother and brother found that day belonged to a friend  --  he was just keeping them as a favor . <p> Williams threw the drugs away and called the accused friend , asking whether the drugs belonged to him . He denied it . <p> Williams , unsure of what course to take , decided to keep an even closer watch on him . Even if her younger son were involved in drugs , he was not cunning enough , she thought , to trick her for long . <p> " He does not have a criminal mind , " she said . " He does n't have the ability . I would tell him , ' You get caught every time . ' He was a follower . Very impressionable . " <p> But her son was not getting caught every time . <p> Neither he nor his mother can offer much insight into why he did not follow his brother 's good example . But both he and his mother say that for some reason , he had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones who shot dice in the school bathroom  --  not the ones who went to class and studied . <p> While his mother pushed programs at the Boys and Girls Clubs , he was skipping school , hitching rides in stolen cars , selling drugs and finding ways to get rid of the cash . <p> He said he worried about hurting his mother , and about her ability to punish him . But there were things he wanted that he could not buy . <p> He described in vivid detail the designer tennis shoes his buddy had  --  three pair , red , green and black . Each pair worth $ 180 . <p> While he stood at bus stops , other guys his age drove by in used cars they called buckets . The guys with the clothes and cars , he noted , were the guys who sold drugs . <p> " I had to have a lot of money in my pockets , " he said . " You could n't ask your mother to hand you $ 60 . " <p> More than a year before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was dabbling in drug sales . <p> Only now does he reveal that he really did know the teenager who threatened him at the pool . He was n't about to tell his mother that he had sold $ 25 worth of PCP for the guy and kept the money . <p> He did n't pay much attention to her warnings to stay away from " bad boys . " But he did stop selling drugs for a while at age 15 , when the family moved from a working-class neighborhood in Northwest Washington to one in Northeast . <p> " It was too dangerous , " he said . " A lot of adults were selling and people were using heroin . I did n't know how to hustle dope . " <p> Later that year , the family moved to an apartment in Southeast . He said he befriended boys at Hart Junior High School and later Ballou High School who sold drugs . He again became a part-time drug dealer . <p> He sold drugs on the way to the store for his mother and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a useful alibi , as did shopping trips to the mall . And when he said he was going to his friend 's home , he did . His mother just never knew that his friend 's apartment building thrived with drug activity . <p> " You could do a lot , " he said . <p> During some of that time , he practiced driving in cars stolen by friends and even crashed a couple of them , he said . He explained that the word would go out that someone had stolen a car . <p> " You find out where it 's parked , and all you need is a screwdriver to get it started , and you could go for a ride , " he said . " Nobody was going to report somebody stole a stolen car . " <p> Sometimes , he and his friends would take a stolen car to a mall . <p> " We would go eat . Go to the arcade . Just have fun , " he said . " You could spend $ 80 that way . We never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause we all figured we would have to explain it to our mothers . Maybe you would buy a T-shirt . You know , something they would n't notice . " <p> He warned his buddies to " have manners " around his mother . " No cussing , say hello Mrs. Williams , do n't say , ' Hey , what 's up ? ' " he told them . <p> They " fronted " for his mother , and he did the same for them . <p> " Their mothers used to say , ' Why do n't you bring that Williams kid around ? He 's got manners . ' <p> " I knew how to act . It would be an act . But it would be a good act . " <p> He said he sometimes was torn between being one of the guys and being the man his mother expected him to be . That double life put him in the midst of a game that was both peculiar and dangerous . <p> Once , when he held onto his money long enough to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I kept thinking how would I tell my mother if I just drove up , " he recalled . " Plus I did n't have a driver 's license . " <p> Months before the shooting , some of his friends were carrying guns , so he got one too . It was for " protection , " he said . But because he did not want his mother to find the gun , he left his " protection " at a friend 's home most of the time . <p> When he brought money home , he would stop before entering the house and stash it in his underwear . <p> The shooting , however , stripped away all pretense . <p> Nothing in her previous experience prepared Williams for a quest to reclaim her son from the streets . <p> For nearly a month after the shooting , she was too nervous and frightened to leave her Southeast Washington apartment to go to work . A telephone ring made her jump . <p> When her son was late , she paced the floor and planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : who would ride in which car in the funeral procession , what she and her elder son would wear , the style of coffin that would hold her younger son . <p> " I once thought about asking the doctor to just put me on Valium until he turned 21 , " she said . <p> Williams 's efforts to monitor her son 's every move left her tired and frustrated . Some nights , she could n't bear the thought of his being out of the house , even after promises that the outing was safe and innocent . Sometimes she bought rest by paying him $ 5 or $ 10 to stay home . <p> She turned to counseling programs . One , Tough Love , offered her advice that she rejected . <p> " They told me there is nothing you can do if he is going to live that way , " she said . " They said if he 's not home by the curfew , lock him out . I said , ' Lock him out ? That would torment me , not him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the door . ' " <p> She bristled at her sister 's suggestion to send him to his father . <p> " I told my son , ' I raised you and I 'll take care of you , ' " she said . " I tell him , ' I may not give you all you want , but I give you all you need . You 've never been hungry or on the streets or cold . ' " <p> But she did get tougher after the September shooting . Although he had passed the legal driving age months before , she stopped him from getting a driver 's permit . " If he was that busy on foot , pray tell what he would do in a car , " she said . <p> She ordered family members not to give him anything for Christmas . She gave him only one gift  --  a book on self-esteem . <p> Williams , who is paid $ 24,000 a year in her District government job , briefly considered leaving the District in hopes that would help her son avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in Northeast Washington . <p> He can not leave the house without telling his mother exactly what he is doing . He must give an address and telephone number , and if he does n't call home she will make him squirm by calling him . <p> During a recent conversation from a friend 's house , he told her goodbye by saying , " Okay , man ; talk to you later , man . " <p> He says he understands why the rules were imposed . <p> " I got a second chance . If I do n't take this chance , I could die , " he said . <p> He said his life now is " regular . " He calls the trouble he now creates  --  including skipping classes and failing two courses  --  minor . Last summer , he worked as a peer counselor and met youngsters whose mothers were hooked on crack cocaine . He counseled a 13-year-old girl who recited a list of men who may have fathered her child . <p> " They made me realize that I 've had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older brother still search his pockets and sometimes bombard him with questions about why his eyes are red or why he is late or why he is so tired . " I know they do n't trust me , " he said . <p> Wiliams stops just short of blaming herself . " I do n't know if his troubles could have been prevented , " she said . " Sometimes I 'm sorry I did n't give my sons a better area to live in or a better school or a father . " <p> She believes her son is on the right path , but she remains vigilant and skeptical . " I will not have blinders on and say he 's at the altar , " she said . <p> If her son strays again , Williams does not know whether she could put him out of her house , as she has promised . " As a parent , my heart would break , " she said . " I 'd be angry to no end . And if he got sentenced to jail , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did this to you . ' " <p> The 17-year-old knows young hustlers who have been disfigured in shootings and are still selling drugs . He said he could walk around the corner from his home if he wanted to become involved in the drug trade again . But , he added , " I know what to do to stay away from drugs . " <p> Where will he be five years from now ? <p> " I 'd like to be living and healthy . "
