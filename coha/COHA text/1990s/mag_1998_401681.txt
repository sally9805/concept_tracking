What ? &gt;If you 're like most women , you 've thought about the choices you 'd make if you developed breast cancer : lumpectomy vs. mastectomy , radiation vs. chemotherapy . What you may not realize is that the decision-making process starts the moment you discover a lump . Here are the answers to the questions you 'll face before you get the diagnosis . ( BY ELIZABETH AUSTIN ) // I found a lump . Now what ? Do n't panic , " says Monica Morrow , M.D. , director of the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago . " That 's good advice , " says Katherine Alley , M.D. , medical director of the Betty Ford Comprehensive Breast Center at Columbia Hospital for Women in Washington , D.C. " If it 's right before your period , wait until after your period to see if it goes away . " Check your breast again a week after your period starts . That 's when the breast is most comfortable and least lumpy . If the lump disappears after your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still there - or if you 're too anxious to wait until after your period - see your primary-care physician . For your peace of mind , ask for ( or demand ) an appointment right away . Breast cancer in young women is often more aggressive than in older women , so it 's critical that you see a physician and that you never ignore a lump ( see " Advice From Women Who 've Been There , " page 136 ) . Your doctor will manually examine your breast , feeling for the lump or any thickening of the tissue . Oftentimes your doctor will order an ultrasound or a mammogram . What will an ultrasound or mammogram tell me ? If your doctor thinks your lump is caused by a cyst- a fluid - filled sac inside the breast - she may ask for an ultrasound , which can show that the lump is filled with fluid and probably benign . ( Sometimes deep cysts can feel like solid lumps , because they push up the breast tissue above them . ) With an ultrasound ( also called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only a technician  --  should look at the ultrasound and should be able to tell whether the lump is a fluidfilled cyst , because ultrasounds give views of fluid in the body . Mammography , a type of X-ray , can show microcalcifications , tiny calcium deposits throughout the breast that can sometimes indicate early-stage cancer . A mammogram also may show that a lump looks like a fibroadenoma , a noncancerous tumor made of a combination of fibrous and glandular tissue , most often found in young women . ( They 're twice as common in AfricanAmerican women . ) Fibroadenomas are usually smooth and rounded , while cancerous tumors mostly appear ragged-edged . Fibroadenomas are harmless and usually do n't need to be removed . Photograph // Mammogram results should be available within 24 hours . " Some radiologists can give immediate results , " Alley says . " You should n't have to wait a long time . Just make sure you go to a place that 's approved by the American College of Radiology . " Most are , but it 's a good idea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds . ( See " Resources " on page 137 . ) Mammograms are not perfect : 10 percent to 15 percent of cancers do n't show up on mammograms , and some lumps are not visible on either an ultrasound or a mammogram . Young women tend to have denser , firmer breasts , so mammograms do n't give as clear a picture of their breast tissue . ( If your doctor ca n't read your mammogram clearly , she 'll need to rely on other methods , mentioned below , to diagnose the lump . ) After I get the ultrasound or mammogram , or if my doctor did n't send me to get one , then what ? You need a referral to a breast specialist . If your HMO wo n't give you a referral , remind your primary-care doctor and the HMO medical directors that misdiagnosed breast cancer is a leading cause of medical malpractice suits . " I think it 's worthwhile to raise a fuss , " says Kay H. Woodruff , M.D. , pathologist and medical director of the J.C . Robinson Cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which breast specialist you 'd like to see , call his or her office to ask for help in getting a referral . " A lot of hospitals now have patient advocates who can help to guide you through some of these systems , " Woodruff says . " I 'm not saying it 's easy , but if you really push , you can probably get authorization to go exactly where you want to go . " Patient advocates can talk with your HMO medical directors and help pave the way to a specialist . Alley agrees . " My feeling is that any persistent lump really needs to be evaluated by a breast specialist . " If all else fails , you can pay for a second opinion yourself . An office visit with a breast specialist will probably cost about $100 or so . If you are pregnant or nursing , you need to find a breast specialist who has experience with lumps in pregnant and nursing women . The breast looks different when a woman is pregnant or nursing , and an experienced specialist needs to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant and nursing women ) and make recommendations for further treatment . What will the breast specialist do ? Depending on what she finds when she manually checks your lump and studies any imaging you may have done , she 'll advise one of several options : watchful waiting , needle aspiration or biopsy . I 'm scared . Why would I want to watch and wait ? The vast majority of breast lumps turn out to be benign - just normal lumpiness , as with women having fibrocystic breasts or premenstrual cysts that disappear on their own . Consequently , many doctors suggest keeping an eye on the lump to see if it grows or changes shape . " A breast surgeon 's job is to evaluate a lump , not necessarily take it out , " says Alley . " A study done a number of years ago showed something like 80 percent of women who came in for an evaluation of a breast lump did not need a surgical biopsy . " This was because women 's lumps did not change in size or shape over time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyst . So if your specialist believes your lump to be benign based on a manual exam of the lump and/or review of the imaging  --  waiting and keeping a watchful eye on it may be perfectly reasonable . Monica Morrow carefully tracks the size of her patients ' breast lumps with a little plastic ruler to make sure they 're not growing . Mary Barton , M.D. , an internist at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care in Boston , says that when she finds a lump that feels like a cyst in a young patient , she asks her to wean herself off caffeine for a month  --  which sometimes causes cysts to shrink or disappear . Alley tells her patients to take vitamin E , which can sometimes reduce premenstrual cysts . Your job is to make sure your doctor is taking your lump seriously . " Be aggressive , and pursue answers to your questions until they 're answered to your satisfaction , " Barton says . My doctor wants to aspirate a suspected cyst . What does that mean ? Another option to diagnose cysts is aspiration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluid from the cyst and is usually painless . After aspiration , " if you can feel the lump disappear and its fluid is n't bloody , it does n't need to be analyzed by a lab , " says Alley . If there 's blood in the fluid or if the lump persists ( even in part ) after the fluid is pulled out , it could be a sign of cancer . In that case , your lump will require a biopsy . Usually , cysts are nothing to worry about , but " if any physician feels a distinct solid lump and tells you it 's a fluid-filled cyst without doing anything to make sure , that should be a red flag , " says Morrow . " Before you accept the diagnosis of a cyst , your doctor needs to prove it . " Real proof requires an ultrasound or aspiration . What is a biopsy ? A biopsy is any procedure that removes cells from the body for to diagnosis . For example , a fine-needle aspiration of a cyst is technically considered a biopsy even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for further testing . A fine-needle aspiration/biopsy also can quickly pull out a few cells from a solid lump . If those cells are found to be cancerous after being sent to a lab , that 's a definite diagnosis . A fine-needle biopsy is also used as additional evidence ( that your lump is not cancerous ) when your doctor thinks your lump is benign and a mammogram shows the lump to have no ragged edges or any other suspicious findings . Alley cites one study of a so-called " triple test , " in which women with lumps got physical exams , mammograms or sonograms , and fine-needle biopsies . " If all three were negative , together that came very close to 100 percent accuracy , " she says . A needle biopsy costs about $150-$400 , with additional laboratory fees of $75-$120 . Another type of lump biopsy is a core-needle biopsy It removes a piece of tissue rather than just a few cells from the breast , since a malignant tumor may also contain noncancerous cells . Specifically , a hollow , relatively thick needle carves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yield a solid diagnosis after being sent to a lab . After analyzing the imaging , breast specialists often choose this method over surgical biopsy ( see below ) since it 's less invasive and almost as reliable . However , because some lumps appear shaded or spotty in the imaging and a coreneedle biopsy only probes one part of a lump , a specialist may opt for surgical biopsy to obtain a reading of the entire mass . Core-needle biopsies are generally done in a doctor 's office with local anesthesia ; they cost about $1,700 . Another option is surgical biopsy , used when your specialist judges it the best method for diagnosis and treatment . A surgeon makes an incision in the breast , removes the entire lump and sends it to a pathology lab for analysis . Surgical biopsies are usually done on an out-patient basis , under a local or general anesthetic , and total cost can reach up to $5,000 . A full analysis of a core-needle or surgical biopsy is usually available in one day . If you 're nursing , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will probably be painful ( and you may have milk leakage from the area of incision ) . My HMO has sent me to a general surgeon for a biopsy . Should n't I see a breast surgeon instead ? Not necessarily . You just need to inquire whether your biopsy is being done by someone with a lot of experience in breast surgery . " If you go to a surgeon who spends most of his time doing colon surgery , you 're going to get a terrible cosmetic result , with unattractive scars and dents in your breast , " says Phyllis J. Kornguth , M.D. , Ph.D. , chief of the breast imaging division at Duke University Medical Center 's department of radiology . If you do n't have access to a specialized breast center , and you 're not sure how to find a general surgeon with extensive breast-surgery experience , Kornguth recommends asking the person who reads your mammogram for a referral . " They see the results of these surgeries all the time , and they know who 's good , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referral . If my biopsy shows malignancy , what do I do next ? Investigate all your options . Depending on your own health history and the type of tumor you have , there are many treatment options available : various kinds of mastectomies and lumpectomies , as well as a wide variety of chemotherapies . Studies have indicated that taking two or three weeks to get second opinions and weigh the alternatives should n't have any impact on your prognosis , Alley says . So take time to do your research and get your questions answered . Only then can you make informed decisions you can live with - literally .

Sidebar Some facts that may calm you : &gt; Breast cancer is rare in women under 40 . These statistics may help put your risk in perspective : The average man is more likely to get breast cancer than a woman under age 30 is , and women under 40 make up only 8 percent of all breastcancer patients . &gt; " A matter of a week or two does n't make a difference in terms of any disease , " says Joann Schellenbach , spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society . Sidebar DO-IT-YOURSELF Sidebar If you 're making only a few quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute to read this and learn to do it right . You just might save your life . It 's important to examine your breasts at the same time each month . Many women 's breasts get puffy and tender as their periods approach , so the best time is probably seven days after your period starts . Make it on a Monday morning , says Brenda Monroe , R.N. , A.O.C.N. ( Advanced Oncology Certified Nurse ) , a clinical nurse specialist at St. John 's Breast Center in Springfield , Mo . " Women tend to do it on Friday night or Saturday . So if they find something abnormal , they spend weekends of their lives worrying and fretting . But if you do your breast exam on Monday morning , you have all week to see your doctor " Here 's a step-by-step : The best position is lying down , though many women prefer the shower . Start with your right arm raised straight above your head , your left hand soaped ( or lotioned ) for easier gliding , fingers flat and held together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and move your fingertips slowly in small circles around the entire breast and underarm area , pressing the tissue firmly against the chest wall to check for lumps or thickenings . Then examine your left breast , using your right hand . The most common signs of breast cancer include a painless lump , an abnormal thickening or a change in density . Occasionally , breast cancer can appear as a lump under the arm , a redness or dimpling of the breast skin or a change in the nipple such as discharge or inversion . Any change in the normal appearance or texture of your breasts should be brought to your doctor 's attention . Sidebar Mammogram tips Sidebar Make sure you tell the technologist where the lump is to get the best image possible . &gt; Do n't wear deodorant or antiperspirant , because it can interfere with the quality of your mammogram. &gt; If nursing , express your milk before the mammogram , Sidebar My doctor says my breasts are " fibrocystic . " What does that mean ? Many doctors use this term to refer to breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger women , who generally have more breast tissue and less fat . " Dense breast tissue is in fact very normal , especially in young women , " says Susan Love , M.D. , in Dr. Susan Love 's Breast Book ( Addison-Wesley , 1995 ) . Women with normally dense or lumpy breasts must be extra-vigilant in their monthly breast self-exams , since it 's important to know which lumps or densities are normal for you and which may be unusual . As it describes a normal condition , Love feels that the term fibrocystic is overused by the profession : " There 's nothing diseased about it .... Fibrocystic disease is a meaningless umbrella term , a wastebasket into which doctors throw every breast problem that is n't cancerous , " she says . Sidebar Advice From Women Who 've Been There Sidebar Roberta Levy , 28 , a health-care consultant in New York City : " Do n't wait .

The result was a very painful procedure that took more than two hours . As it turned out , Shay did n't have breast cancer . In fact , the breast specialist she eventually consulted said the biopsy was unnecessary . Shay filed a malpractice suit , which was resolved out of court . She says that if she were ever in the same place again , she would call friends and health-care providers , find a highly regarded doctor and seek an expert second opinion . " Never take one doctor 's word for gospel , " Shay says . " You 're asking for disaster . I learned that the hard way .
