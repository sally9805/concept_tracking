A Better Option Many thanks to James Torrens , S.J. , for his report on the demonstration at the School of the Americas ( 1212 , Of Many Things ) . The decision not to process the trespassers came after Maj. Gen. Ernst declared to the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer ( 11/20 , p . A-10 ) : " I do n't want to have to arrest anybody . It 's unfortunate that I have to , because I do n't want to . But I absolutely have to enforce the law at Fort Benning . " What message does the general teach when he says on Friday , " I must " and on Sunday says , " We chose another option " ( Ledger-Enquirer Online , 11/23 ) ? James H. McCarthy Somerville , Mass . Challenge to Complicity I read with interest and increasing dismay your issue on " Challenges of Latin America " ( 11/28 ) . Our complicity in the conditions in Central and South America is well known . Our insatiable demand for illegal drugs , the amoral capitalism of our corporations , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " challenge " next to insurmountable . We ca n't even close the totally obsolete and counter-productive School of the Americas ! A case in point : " Senator-for-Life " Pinochet is , no doubt , an unsavory character , but in a very real way he is our unsavory character . So , when and if he is brought to justice for his crimes against humanity , which U.S. citizens will be brought to the international bar of justice for complicity ? Sometime in the future this country will no longer be the only superpower . Will we then be able to ignore international law when it is " in our national interest " to do so ? Nicholas E. Bedessem Boonsboro , Md . Truth of Human Reality Avery Dulles , S.J. , ( 12/5/98 ) appears to undercut the validity of rights that belong to homosexual persons ( gay rights ) , as though these rights constituted an agenda that stands outside the spirit and letter of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Homosexuality is not simply a type of human behavior that is directly controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific studies indicate that sexual orientation is not so much chosen as discovered , and that it is a fundamental element that constitutes the identity of an individual and embraces one 's entire social and affective life . This kind of human experience needs to be a point of departure for a social philosophy that develops its implications . Otherwise , any philosophy of the human person and the person 's attendant rights not rooted in the truth of human reality would run the risk of being an a priori system that merely deduces " truths " from principles that may themselves be insufficiently stable . The study of human experience is not an exercise in positivism . Luc Quirion Jackson Heights , N. Y. More Moral Analysis Your editorial , " The Senate Should Not Convict " ( 1/2 ) , disappointed me . When I read AMERICA , I hope to find analysis that takes into account moral values-that considers legal and political issues in the context of Christian beliefs . In the case of the editorial on our President 's situation , I feel your analysis did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have liked AMERICA to address in its editorial are : ( 1 ) how to balance the public 's interest in ensuring our leaders are fit to serve with Christian beliefs about the need to forgive and not judge others ; ( 2 ) whether questions about the genuineness of Clinton 's repentance for lying for personal gain to his family , other officers of our Government , the courts and the rest of us need to be taken into account in the impeachment process ; and ( 3 ) whether Judge Kenneth Starr violated the public trust himself by pursuing a perjury indictment the way he did , and if so , how tha might affect the decision to be made on Clinton 's removal from office . Robert J. Asselin Jr Washington , D.C Personally Responsible It was with dismay that I read your editorial , " The Senate Should Not Convict " ( 1/2 ) . I disagree with the position , the stated logic and the conclusions . Most importantly , the implications of your position confuse the real issue for Catholic Christian citizens and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as a nation we would do well to place a high premium on truth-telling . Avoidance of truth is an avoidance of personal responsibility . Assuming we are mentally competent ( the initial assumption about a person in a leadership position ) , we are each personally responsible for our actions . I believe the real question for today 's Christian should be , " How much deceit and bad behavior should we tolerate in our leaders ? " Gerald Peer , M.D. Buffalo , N. Y. A Better Case Though I fully support your position that the Senate should not convict President Clinton as charged ( editorial , 1/2 ) , I would question whether it is appropriate for AMERICA to offer an opinion . AMERICA is , after all , a Catholic publication , and it seems less than fitting to take a position on either side of the issue . This is not to say that AMERICA should not address controversial subjects , as this seems to me to be one of its major strengths . Rather it is to say that in the area of politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secular press . The editorial cites the strong public support of Mr. Clinton as one reason why censure would be a more appropriate course of action than conviction . World opinion is strongly against the bombings of Sudan and Iraq and to a lesser degree to the bombing of Afghanistan , and yet this view seems to be all but ignored by politicians and the media alike . Aside from any possible political motivation for the bombings , the killing of innocent human beings whose only sin would be to be in the wrong place is difficult to justify . This is especially so when so little seems to be accomplished . The facts seem to indicate the opposite in that any support for American policy in the Middle East is fast ebbing . A better case for impeachment and conviction could be made from President Clinton 's reckless behavior that resulted in countless deaths . There is a wealth of worthy and appropriate causes for AMERICA to address . The trial of Bill Clinton is not one of them . Richard Strickla Steilacoom , Wash Altogether Dismayed Each Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God for the celebrant . He is generally middle-aged or older , with gray hair or a receding hairline . I wonder how long will we be blessed with his presence . I see a man of commitment , self-sacrifice , generosity , idealism and infinite patience in a world of selfseeking inconstancy , frustration and emptiness . I listen as he feels for the pulse of his flock-encouraging , gently admonishing , pointing us to the stars and opening our eyes with wonder . The returned missioner evokes a sense of awe and provides an example of quiet heroism , unassuming but magnetic in the appeal he holds for our deepest longings to be more than we are , to step out into the unknown with the Lord . I am altogether dismayed by Mary Margaret Car 's suggestion ( 12/19/98 ) that we quantify , measure , take out a magnifying glass to the gift of this man 's life . Maureen O'Riordan-Lundy San Francisco , Calif Absurd Accepted Mary Margaret Carberry 's " Priests as Human Resources " ( 12/19/98 ) suggests evaluations for priests . As one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , and now when fewer are required , I think many of them were a reminder that the absurd becomes first accepted and then compulsory . One school 's evaluation form , however , began with a particularly useful question , " Grade you expect to receive for this course . " To evaluate a priest , it would be reasonable to start with a yes/no question like " I tithe " or " I pray morning and evening , " or a multiple choice item like " I come to reconciliation monthly , early , never , " or " I attend liturgy daily , weekly , monthly , sporadically . " Priests would probably discover the same close correlations I found between my students ' grade expected and other answers , remarks and comments . Good students like you and poor ones do n't . Not knowing canon law , I wonder whataside from terminal overwork and understaffing-prevents a priest from designing and administering his own evaluation . Really , he would find more A-B than C-D parishioners , get some positive feedback and be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps my planning . ) If we asked a sociologist to set up a form , he could tell us whether a priest 's voluntary do-it-yourself evaluation would be more effective than a highly general form that is simpler and cheaper , and can be " universally " applied . Please God , doing God 's work , the church would not opt for the latter . Joan Huber Berardinelli Allison Park , Pa . Affirm Strengths I found myself in disagreement with the recent article " Priests as Human Resources , " by Mary Margaret Carberry ( 12/19/98 ) . I have been a priest for 43 years , 10 of those as priest personnel director for the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis . I feel I have some sense of the pulse of the priests . The average pastor gets negative feedback from the congregation almost weekly . It will often come in unsigned letters , anonymous phone calls or direct confrontation . All priests have shortcomings , but most of the priests I know are keenly , and sometimes painfully , aware of what theirs might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirm them in their strengths and give then the support they need to continue to grow ? " One learns in courses on personnel management that the way to enhance job performance is not to focus on weaknesses but rather to affirm strengths and give people an awareness of the areas that are subject to growth . Ms. Carberry speaks of parish staffs as if they are sycophants , bowing to the whims of their pastor . I know dozens of parish staff people , and most of then are very skilled , highly professional and not afraid to take issue with the pastor when the situation warrants it . It is demeaning to portray then in a lesser light . Granted , they may not be able to say everything that comes to mind , but this is no different from any setting in the business world between staff and employers . Most pastors I know would welcome genuine feedback on their ministry , but they want it to be done by people who truly know and care for them . Because the priest is a public figure , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everything that goes wrong . The expectation is that because he is responsible for everything , he should rectify everything . And if he does n't correct everything , then he has failed . Very few priests have spiritual directors , perhaps fewer than 15 percent . Often the priest feels he has no one to assess his priorities , his use of time , his prayer life , his leisure , the balance in his life , and so on . His " boss , " the bishop , has perhaps several hundred other priests to deal with and does not feel that he can give an accurate evaluation of his ministry . So the pastor is left in Limbo with no one to turn to for direction and support . A variety of different assessment tools have been employed in a number of dioceses , with minimal success . The problem is that most pastors are gun shy . They are skeptical of another program coming from the chancery to make them feel even more inadequate . They are looking for ways to lighten their load , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastor and shaming him into submission , let me suggest that we look for ways to support his ministry , highlight his skills and give him the impetus and courage to grow . We all agree that , like every Christian , he is challenged to grow . ( Rev. ) William J. Kenney Minneapolis , Minn . Heroic Words Thank you for Susan Sullivan 's " The Advent of Tears " ( 12/5/98 ) . Her comments about the content of homilies and the needs of parents represent the feelings of many , and not just women . Many are addressing the problem for themselves by simply discontinuing their participation in Sunday liturgy . Susan 's comments are themselves one of the best homilies I heard this Advent , assuring me that there are others who share my aspirations . Yes , it would be good for parents to hear other parents preach the word of God . It might even be better for those of us who are celibate to hear God 's word preached by the faithful who are living God 's word of love in an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miriam Therese Larkin , CS.J . San Luis Obispo , Calif Good Homily " The Advent of Tears " ( 12/5/98 ) by Susan Sullivan could , no doubt , be duplicated by many mothers , grandmothers , and even fathers . It was a good homily in itself . Kathleen Whitfield , RS.CJ . Albany , N.Y . Yes ! Yes ! I want to congratulate you on the Christmas issue of AMERICA . From the cover to the book reviews , it is very good . I want to single out , however , the article " The Shame of Our Dear Humanness " by John Kavanaugh , S.J. , and the short piece " From the Mouth of Babes " by the Rev. William F. Wegher for the way they capture the real meaning of Christmas . Father Kavanaugh tells the truth of our condition with a power that makes me want to shout " Yes ! Yes ! " Father Wegher 's ability to learn from his niece and then to put his insight into words was very moving . Thanks for this Christmas gift . William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
