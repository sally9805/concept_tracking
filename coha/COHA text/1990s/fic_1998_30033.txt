As do I. Corran frowned . Still , my decision has been made . He 'd felt it the greatest of honors to be asked by Luke Skywalker to leave Rogue Squadron and train to become a Jedi . Skywalker had told him that his grandfather Nejaa Halcyon had been a Jedi Master who had been slain in the Clone Wars . The lightsaber Corran had discovered in the Galactic Museum had belonged to Nejaa and had been presented to Corran as his rightful inheritance . Mine is the heritage of a Jedi Knight . But that was a heritage he had only heard of from Skywalker . He did not doubt the Jedi was telling the truth , but it was not the whole truth . At least not the whole of the truth with which I grew up . Throughout his life Corran Horn had come to believe his grandfather was Rostek Horn , a valued and highly placed member of the Corellian Security Force . His father , Hal Horn , likewise was with CorSec . When it came time for Corran to choose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He continued the Horn tradition of serving CorSec . His grandfather had always admitted to having known a Jedi who died in the Clone Wars , but that acquaintance had been given no more weight than having once met Imperial Moff Fliry Vorru or having visited Imperial Center , as Coruscant had been known under the Empire 's rule . Corran found it no great surprise that Rostek Horn and his father had downplayed their ties to Nejaa Halcyon . Halcyon had died in the Clone Wars ; and Rostek had comforted , grown close with , and married Halcyon 's widow . He also adopted Halcyon 's son , Valin , who grew up as Hal Horn . When the Emperor began his extermination of the Jedi order , Rostek had used his position at CorSec to destroy all traces of the Halcyon family , insulating his wife and adopted son from investigation by Imperial authorities . Since exhibiting any interest in the Jedi Knights could invite scrutiny and my family would be very vulnerable if its secret were discovered , I probably heard less about the Jedi Knights than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holodramas that painted the Jedi Knights as villains and later reminiscences by his grandfather about the Clone Wars , Corran would have known little or nothing about the Jedi . Like most other children , he found them vaguely romantic and all too much sinister , but they were distant and remote while what his father and grandfather did was immediate and exciting . He raised a hand and pressed it to the golden Jedi medallion he wore around his neck . It had been a keepsake his father had carried and Corran inherited after his father 's death . Corran had taken it as a lucky charm of sorts , never realizing his father had kept it because it bore the image of his own father , Nejaa Halcyon : Wearing it had been my father 's way of honoring his father and defying the Empire . Likewise , I wore it to honor him , not realizing I was doing more through that act . Skywalker 's explanation to him of what his relationship to Nejaa Halcyon was opened new vistas and opportunities for him . In joining CorSec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that paralleled the Jedi mission : making the galaxy safe for others . As Luke had explained , by becoming a Jedi , Corran could do what he had always done but on a larger scale . That idea , that opportunity , was seductive , and clearly all of his squadron-mates had expected him to jump at it . Corran smiled . I thought Councilor Borsk Fey'lya was going to die when I turned down the offer . In many ways I wish he had . He shook his head , realizing that thought was unworthy of himself and really wasted on Borsk Fey'lya . Corran was certain that , on some level , the Bothan Councilor believed he -- not Corran -- was right and his actions were vital to sustain the New Republic . Re-creating the Jedi order would help provide a cohesive force to bind the Republic together and to drape it in the nostalgic mantle of the Old Republic . Just as having various members of nation-states placed in Rogue Squadron had helped pull the Republic together , having a Corellian become a new Jedi might influence the Diktat into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skywalker had asked him to , and Fey'lya had assumed he would , join the Jedi order , but that was because neither of them knew of or realized that his personal obligations and promises exerted more influence with him than any galactic cause . While Corran realized that doing the greatest good for the greatest number was probably better for everyone in the long run , he had short-term debts he wanted to repay , and time was of the essence in doing so . The remnants of the Empire had captured , tortured , and imprisoned him at Lusankya , which he later came to realize was really a Super Star Destroyer buried beneath the surface of Coruscant . He had escaped from there -- a feat never before successfully accomplished -- but had gotten away only with the aid of other prisoners . He had vowed to them that he would return and liberate them , and he fully intended to keep his promise . The fact that they were imprisoned in the belly of the SSD that now orbited Thyferra made that task more difficult , but long odds against success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What use have I for odds ? His desire to save them had increased with a chance discovery that embarrassed him mightily when he made it . In Lusankya the Rebel prisoners had been led by an older man who simply called himself Jan . Since his escape , Corran had caught a holovision broadcast of a documentary on the heroes of the Rebel Alliance . First and foremost among them had been the general who led the defense of Yavin 4 and planned the destruction of the first Death Star , Jan Dodonna . The documentary said he 'd been slain during the evacuation of Yavin 4 , but Corran had no doubt Dodonna had been a prisoner on Lusankya . If I had n't thought him dead , I might have recognized him , too . How stupid of me . Dodonna 's celebrity had nothing to do with Corran 's desire to save him . Jan , like Urlor Sette and others , had helped him escape . They had risked their lives to give him a chance to get away . Leaving such brave people captives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their courage but repaid them by leaving them in severe jeopardy of death or worse -- conversion into a covert Imperial agents under Isard 's direction . " Could n't sleep ? " Corran started , then turned and smiled at the blackhaired , dark-eyed woman standing in the bedroom doorway . " I guess not , Mirax . I 'm sorry I woke you . " " You did n't wake me . Your absence awakened me . " She wore a dark blue robe , belted at the waist with a pale yellow sash . Mirax raised a hand to hide a yawn then pointed at the silver cylinder in his right hand . " Regretting your decision ? " " Which one ? Refusing to join the Jedi Knights or "  - -  he smiled --  " or hooking up with you ? " She raised an eyebrow . " I was thinking of the Jedi decision . If you have reservations about the other decision , I can relearn how to sleep alone . " He laughed , and she joined him . " I regret neither . Your father and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't imagine having a better friend than you . " " Or lover . " " Especially lover . " Mirax shrugged . " All you men who 've just gotten out of prison say that . " Corran frowned for a moment . " I imagine you 're right , but how you came by that information , I do n't want to know . " Mirax blinked her eyes . " You know , I do n't think I want to know that , either . " Corran laughed , then crossed the room and enfolded her in a warm hug . " After my escape , Tycho expressed his regrets concerning your death to me . He told me how Warlord Zsinj had ambushed a convoy at Alderaan and destroyed it , including your Pulsar Skate . Everything inside of me just collapsed . Losing you just ripped the emotional skeleton out of me . " " Now you know how I felt when I thought you 'd been slain here on Coruscant . " She kissed his left ear , then settled her chin on his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become part of my life until you were gone . The hole the Lusankya created blasting her way out of Coruscant was nothing compared to the void I had inside . It was n't a question of wanting to die , but of knowing my insides were dead and wondering when the rest of me would catch up . "
