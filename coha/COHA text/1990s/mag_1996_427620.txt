Section : World report Korea 's phenomenal economic rise may at last be running out of steam <p> Dateline : Korea <p> In a single generation , South Korea became the model for the developing world . An industrial powerhouse that can now jolt world markets in everything from advanced memory chips to steel , its booming economy lifted some 40 million people out of poverty as per capita gross national product went from $87 in 1962 to more than $10,000 . The nation topped it off by ousting military rulers and embracing democracy . This fall , Korea won the graduate diploma : an invitation to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , the elite club of industrial democracies . <p> Korea seemed to have solved the riddle that faces poor nations everywhere : how to acquire capital and technology to leapfrog stages of industrial development  --  and become rich . <p> So it has come as all the more of a shock both to Koreans and others in the developing world that the boom shows signs of going bust . Korea is plunging into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade gap is yawning as exports slacken . That is a particularly disconcerting statistic for Koreans , who figured the days of serious economic imbalances and dependence on foreigners for capital injections ended in 1988 , when Korea posted a $14 billion surplus on its current account , the broadest measure of the trade balance . This year 's account deficit is projected to hit $20 billion . <p> Is the miracle over ? As growth slows and exports remain sluggish , imports are not shrinking as expected but booming . " This indicates the problem is structural , not just cyclical , " says Oum Bong Sung , economist at the Korea Development Institute . Says Ro Sung Tae , president of Hanwha Economic Research Institute , " Inefficiency and high cost have weakened the competitiveness of the Korean economy . " <p> The question that other Asian " tigers " are nervously asking is : Are we next ? One school of thought argues that Korea is peculiar enough and different enough that its current problems should hold no terrors for other regional economic powers . Korea is burdened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of acrimonious labor-management relations . <p> But others point to practices that Korea , in common with most of the fast-growing economies of Asia , used with stunning effect to pump up growth with the economic equivalent of steroids  --  but that are now having debilitating side effects , including : <p> High finance costs . The government used banks to funnel credit to favored industries , but economists now believe that inefficiency and overstaffing in the unreformed bank iustry costs borrowers several percentage points , amounting to billions of dollars of extra costs . Three-year corporate bond rates are 7 percentage points higher than inflation . <p> High transportation costs . While Young Soo Gil , president of the Korea Transport Institute , argues that Korea 's overall investment in infrastructure may be adequate , he blames user-insensitive bureaucrats for inefficiency . Korea 's distribution costs as a ratio to sales are nearly twice those of the United States . <p> Inflated land costs . Land speculation was a byproduct of Korea 's clumsy monetary controls . Exacerbating a shortage of land because of Korea 's mountainous terrain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualify for loans artificially drives up demand and prices , pushing up business costs . <p> Economic concentration . Big business groups dominate the financial system , making it hard for small and medium-sized companies to get funding . Weak enforcement of fair-trade laws makes small companies vulnerable to predatory practices . While the big groups have strengths  --  and indeed were the backbone of the first stage of Korea 's export drive  --  Hong Won Tack , Seoul University economist , argues they have stomped entrepreneurship and creativity . <p> Criticisms of the management of Korea Inc. and other Asian economies are nothing new . Free-market economists , starting with American advisers in the 1960s , told Koreans for decades that they were doing it all wrong . Yet Koreans blithely ignored orthodox economics  --  with remarkable success . <p> Instead of letting market forces get in the way , the military government of Park Chung Hee in the 1960s nationalized banks , borrowed money abroad and funneled it at cheap rates to favored export industries , while making it hard for Korean consumers to spend money . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial policy to central planning , with industrial power concentrated in huge privately owned business conglomerates that took cues from government . Every time the economy landed on the rocks , as during the two oil shocks of the 1970s , Koreans just borrowed more , built more factories and exported their way out of trouble . <p> Yet in the 1990s the magic is undeniably gone , and many Koreans themselves agree that reform is long overdue . Koreans moan that growth this year is dipping from 9 percent to below 7 percent and heading for 6 percent or less next year  --  a growth rate that Americans would still envy . But the economy is in significantly worse shape than the numbers suggest . A good chunk of this year 's growth is a statistical illusion : Calculations are based on 1990 prices , even though the price of Korea 's biggest export item , computer memory chips , has plunged 75 percent this year . Petrochemicals and steel are down , too . <p> Given Korea 's level of development and the high level of investment  --  37.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing better . But while the slowdown is bad , economists are more worried by the failure of the economy to adjust . Because market forces do n't function to bring the economy into balance , the government resorts to clumsy direct intervention : screaming at consumers to stop buying imported goods and cracking down on returning overseas travelers who illegally breach the $5,000 limit on credit card balances . <p> Odd man out . While the global glut of electronic goods this year has hit exports up and down Asia 's Pacific rim , other economies like Singapore 's and Taiwan 's are projected to bounce back . Koreans speak enviously of Taiwan 's vibrant small companies that react with lightning speed to shifts in the marketplace . <p> There is no doubt that Korea is different on several important scores . Its economic management has been more centralized , with industrial power more highly concentrated in big business groups . Domestic industry has been more heavily protected against both imports and inward direct investment . The popular revolt against military rule in 1987 strengthened the hand of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid wage growth helped secure commitment from Korean workers during the boom years , when Korea 's wages were cheap , wages have continued to soar  --  up 16 percent a year since 1987 , compared with inflation at 6.2 . During this year 's slowdown , wages are up over 10 percent . Even while rights to organize are weak , management is powerless to resist wage demands from workers who by law can not be replaced in a strike . Korea 's per capita GNP is 30 percent less than Taiwan 's , for example , yet industrial wages are 27 percent higher . Manufacturing unit labor costs in Korea have risen 46 percent since 1985 , compared with 25 percent in Taiwan and 4.4 percent in the United States . <p> Lee Hahn Koo argues that with reform of labor and finance markets , deregulation and efforts to boost entrepreneurs , Korea 's economy can bounce back , too , with continued growth at 7 to 8 percent for many years without severe imbalances . But if Korea 's peculiar history has made the need for economic reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it harder to achieve . President Kim Young Sam came to office four years ago planning to enforce fair-trade rules and pare down business groups . Despite some achievements , he soon discovered that however necessary they may be in the long run , reforms carried a short-term price of lower growth and lower popularity ratings . Last month , the government retreated from plans to whittle at the financial power of business conglomerates . Next year , in the run-up to the presidential election , reform is definitely off the agenda . <p> GRAPH : Can it last ?
