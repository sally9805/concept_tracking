<p> THE man making Richard Kimble run is Marshal Sam Gerard . The man making " " The Fugitive " run is director Andy Davis . <p> With record-breaking box-office returns for the Harrison Ford film 's opening weekend - $ 23.4 million , the biggest August opening in the history of the universe - Davis is getting lots of public recognition . Suddenly he 's the hot director that every morning show wants to interview . <p> In Hollywood , Davis was already hot . He had a reputation for turning standard action pictures into respectable films and making martial-arts stars into actors . <p> His first major film , " " Code of Silence " ( 1985 ) , was immediately hailed as Chuck Norris ' best movie , especially for its good use of locations in Chicago ( Davis ' hometown ) and for giving Norris ' character a shade of personality . In 1988 , Davis returned to Chicago for Steven Seagal 's violent but surprisingly textured debut , " " Above the Law . " <p> That earned Davis " " The Package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hackman and Tommy Lee Jones . Again , part of the film was shot in Chicago . <p> Davis got away from the Windy City in last year 's surprise blockbuster " " Under Siege " . Set aboard a hijacked battleship , it made the crossover from Seagal action picture to international thriller . Again , as throughout his career , Davis was praised for his use of locations and his work with actors , especially Jones , who stole the movie as an eccentric villain . <p> " " Under Siege " made a lot of money , it got very good reviews , and what Tommy and I did was recognized , " said Davis . <p> " " It was the basis of Harrison saying , ' Get Andy to direct the movie . ' " <p> " " The Fugitive " producer Arnold Kopelson made Ford aware of Davis . <p> " " ( After ) the premiere of " " Under Siege , " I went to the heads of Warner Bros. and said , ' Listen , this is the guy I think should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They agreed , and Harrison then went to see " " Under Siege , " liked it and agreed . " <p> Both Kopelson and Ford liked Davis ' ability to work around the cliches of the action genre and turn each part into a believable character with dimension . <p> Davis , calling from Los Angeles on the afternoon that " " The Fugitive 's " weekend box-office figures were released , sounded pleased to have shown that his talent is broader than making good action movies . <p> " " There was this level of real tough-guy stuff that was too much for a mass audience , maybe , " Davis said of his earlier films . " " Now , with this story , and Harrison and Tommy Lee , it 's got a broader base . And maybe ( I ) got better . I do n't know . It just came together . " <p> For Davis , the difference between just another shoot'em-up and a quality picture is involving the audience on a level beyond its primal responses to action . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " " Make it a puzzle they want to follow and figure out . You have to care about the people , not about the stunts , whether it 's a thriller or an action film . We do n't spend too much time on the stunts . We do ' em , but the hard part is making the movie come to life . " <p> As in the case of " " Under Siege , " Jones ' performance in " " The Fugitive " has stolen much of the attention usually lavished on the top-billed star . Jones ' character is not as idiosyncratic as in the former film , but it has many distinctive features in the way he talks to the members of his search team . Lawman Gerard gets the movie 's best lines and most of the laughs . <p> In both pictures , Davis and Jones worked day by day to reshape Jones ' character into something more interesting than in the script . <p> " " He 's a great collaborator , " Davis said of Jones . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marshals for Tommy to work with . He was able to take that ensemble of actors and work together to create all that life . Tommy had a lot to do with making them come alive . <p> " " The film is what it is because of Tommy and Harrison . It 's a delicate balance . Harrison has a more difficult part than Tommy , in that ( Kimble ) has nobody to talk to . He 's the straight man , in a way . By the time Tommy comes on , you 're invested in Kimble and his tragedy . " <p> Despite his great acting talent , Jones has long been known for being difficult and confrontational , a reputation that got wider currency with a recent New York Times interview in which the writer told the nitty-gritty of having to work with him . <p> Even Kopelson said Jones can be difficult . But he 's certainly been good for Davis , who was n't about to add to the stories . <p> " " He 's not a jerk , " the director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes . I do n't know . I 've done three films with him , and I know he can be very scary to people , but if you know him , it just sort of goes by you . " <p> Unlike Kopelson , who was a longtime fan of " " The Fugitive " TV series of the 1960s , Davis had little knowledge of the original version . He said he brought numerous changes to the film script . Oddly enough , some of those made the movie more like the TV show than it might have been otherwise . <p> " " The film was in development for five years , " Davis said . <p> " " They had every kind of ( script ) draft . The script I got , in October , Gerard had hired the one-armed man to kill Kimble 's wife because Kimble has screwed up ( as a doctor ) on Gerard 's wife . " This plot idea was later dropped , bringing the film more into line with the original series . <p> " " It was important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which also happened in the TV series ) . It was important that they respect each other . And that we knew much more about Kimble and who he was as a human being and the circumstances around his marriage . <p> " " Roy Huggins ( who originated the TV show and was an executive producer for the film ) is a great guy , and I was very happy that the creator of the series really liked it . " Although Kimble 's situation seems resolved at the end of the movie , Kopelson and others have hinted that a sequel is possible . If that 's true , Davis would consider directing . <p> " " I do n't think they have the script worked out , but there has definitely been discussion about it , " he said . <p> But he turned cagey about what might happen in such a sequel . <p> Could they really put Kimble on the run yet again ? <p> " " I do n't know . It could be , it could be . There 's an angle we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share what that angle is ? <p> " " No , " he said . <p> No matter . With the apparent success of " " The Fugitive , " we should find out soon enough .
