The poetry club in Jean 's neighborhood scheduled readings of new works every Wednesday in the basement of a popular restaurant , The Two Bruce Cafe . A surprising lot of people showed up regularly to hear and then critique the week 's artistic efforts , and the two lawyers named Bruce who owned the place felt rewarded because the audience was hungry afterwards and stayed to eat . <p> This Wednesday , a few days before Easter , the club was featuring Harriet Marriott 's latest poems about incest and Arthur M. Armlicher 's poems about such matters as the lead in drinking water and salmonella in eggs . Jean 's husband did n't think it would be entertaining , so she arranged to meet Claude and Edith , two of their unmarried friends . Although she often argued with him about their responsibility to the community , Jean 's husband did n't like listening to words without music and most Wednesdays stayed home , playing board games on his portable computer and watching Court TV . <p> Soon before showtime , it started to rain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only a light rain , really a drizzle , but Jean dressed in a raincoat , rain hat , rain boots , and carried an umbrella in her satchel just in case . Jean did n't like getting wet . Her husband asked if Jean had her keys , if she had fed the cat , and if there was a honeydew melon in the trunk of the car . The answer was yes , straight down the line . <p> Winter or summer , they ate melon for breakfast , honeydew ( Jean 's favorite ) or cantaloupe . Over the years , Jean had selected so many melons , she always expected to score a good one , but her judgment did n't always work . She squeezed , smelled , and stroked a melon , looking for a certain scent , the bounce of ripeness , golden veins in the cantaloupes , and in the honeydews , a squeaky surface with a texture like washable silk . Still , melons can be disappointing , hard or tasteless , particularly in winter , when they import them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peru . The latest melon was in that who-knows category , and Jean had left it in the trunk of the car in the hope that it might ripen better with a few extra hours in a warm snug place . " I 'll get the melon on a jury break , " her husband said with some relish . He loved the rain . <p> Jean arrived at The Two Bruce Cafe early , and bought a fancy bottled sparkling water at the bar . Brendan , the bartender , referred to it as " dreadful Welsh water , " and he was pouring it into a wineglass when Jean 's attention was diverted by a bearded face . She stared right through the man 's thick eyeglasses into his eyes . They had no mirth . They had no fire . They reflected no opinion at all . They were pale blue plates . Jean was transfixed . Then she was flustered . She had stared too long . " You remind me of someone I know , " she tried to explain . " I thought you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Zemmis , " he said . " Can I sit with you ? " Jean flinched at the speed of his demand . She had no desire to be impolite , but no time either to think of an excuse . Her smile was overly bright . " Actually , " she said , " I 'm meeting friends . " <p> Jean gave Brendan three dollars for the glass of water , and carried it downstairs to the basement , where she picked out a small round table with three chairs . Seeing Zemmis right behind her , she laid an object on each chair ( her rain hat , her umbrella , and her scarf ) to indicate that she was saving the seats . She looked up to meet Zemmis 's blank blue eyes . " Why do n't you sit here ? " Jean said , pointing to the adjacent table , as if she were a real-estate agent touting a fine neighboring island , surrounded by its own unique stretch of air . Zemmis sat down . <p> " Are you a poet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still smiling too hard . " Yes , " Zemmis replied . " Professional ? " They both laughed at the idea of writing poetry for a living . " I 've had some poems published , " he said , and Jean did n't ask where . " I 'm also a potter , " he said . " I just came from a ceramics class . " <p> Jean 's bedroom window looked out on Potter 's House . As a friendly coincidence , she began to offer up that news , but stopped herself short . Suppose Zemmis took pottery classes often , and found out how close her bedroom window was to his school ? She sipped her sparkling drink . Zemmis ducked down under the table . When he came up again , he was holding a bowl . He handed it to Jean . " I made this , " he said . The bowl was the color of muddy plums , heavy as a boulder , and large enough to hold the porridge of Mother Bear . It was not beautifully shaped , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How lovely , " Jean said . <p> Jean was admiring the decorative scratchings on Zemmis 's bowl when Claude and Edith arrived . They were carrying cocktails they brought from the bar . Jean introduced everybody . Claude and Edith were chatty people , gregarious  --  yes , very sociable . They promptly engaged Zemmis in vivid descriptions of ceramic pots they had seen on their last trip to Greece . On and on they went about Greek pots . Enough about pots , Jean thought , but there was no stopping them . Luckily , at the microphone , Harriet Marriott was clearing her throat . The reading was about to begin . Jean angled her chair so that her back was turned to Zemmis , and formed a circle that excluded him . <p> The first group of poems was very long , almost interminable , and Jean sneaked a look at her watch . Edith kicked Jean under the table , and Jean rolled her eyes . Claude took a little nap . Harriet Marriott used endless images of the broken heads and torn-out stuffings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's room , Edith went to the ladies ' room , and Jean went upstairs to the bar . She brought her martini downstairs to enhance the second set . <p> During Arthur M. Armlicher 's reading , Jean 's party was getting hungry , and trying not to yawn . A few tables away , Jean noticed Harriet Marriott making notes on her performance , so she felt comfortable passing napkin notes to Edith like " I 'm starving ! " and " Tonight 's special is grilled tuna ! " and " When can we eat ? " When Arthur M. Armlicher 's last poem , " Death in a Faucet , " came to its merciless end , Claude and Edith rushed upstairs to secure a dinner table , while Jean told Harriet Marriott she would call later with her critical opinions , she was too moved to think . <p> Claude ordered the Two Bruce Lime Chicken , Jean and Edith chose the blackened bluefish . The women also each ordered a glass of white wine , while Claude , who could n't tolerate more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relieved as they were that the reading was over , Jean and her friends continued to dwell on the flaws in Harriet Marriott 's poems . They were approaching the giggling stage , when Jean felt a presence over her shoulder , and saw Claude 's eyebrows shoot up . " Hi , can I join you ? " Jean heard Zemmis say . She and Claude spoke simultaneously : Jean said , " We 're having a conference , " and Claude said , " Sure , pull up a chair . " Zemmis listened to Claude . <p> " Have you ordered yet ? What are you having ? " he asked , scanning the menu . " How 's the chicken in tarragon butter ? Is it usually good ? " Soon all their attention was focused on him . <p> Jean burned with annoyance . This was their neighborhood restaurant . The fun of it was not making conversation with strangers , but feeling at home with your friends . Why did n't Zemmis see himself as an intruder ? Why did Claude invite him to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf , supposing him to be an old chum ? How wrong he was , Jean thought , with gritted teeth , as she listened to Zemmis tell Claude and Edith about his positions in lumber , apples , and natural gas . Amazingly , he shared with Claude a near-obsession with old Ronson lighters and stamps . He spoke in strangely formal elocutions , and some sort of clipped foreign accent , like a Third World prince who has conducted a lifetime of diplomacy with Englishmen . At the moment , Zemmis said , he lived way out on the North Shore of Long Island , but had been raised in an orthodox Jewish section of Flushing , New York . Before the next winter , however , he was thinking of moving to Sarasota , Florida , in order to matriculate at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &; Bailey school for clowns . <p> The waiter took Zemmis 's order before clearing the three empty plates . Impulsively , Edith ordered a slice of chocolate mud pie for the rest of them to split for dessert . The dessert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any . Zemmis helped himself to her share . Watching Zemmis dig into the chocolate pie , Jean wondered if she was having hot flashes . She had started to see stars and to sweat . She announced a trip to the ladies ' room . She needed to think . <p> In privacy , Jean fanned her underarms and splashed cold water on her face . Clown school ? Jean wondered how Zemmis managed to afford all his scholarship . She suspected a secret income . She pictured a rabbi , Zemmis 's old bearded father , a leader to his people , alone in his temple , crying and keening for Zemmis , his pushy , dysfunctional son . Jean guessed the rabbi would do any-thing  --  even send his son to clown school  --  to keep him from sticking his fork into the hundreds of slices of pie that belonged to the poor trusting members of the rabbi 's congregation in Flushing , New York . Jean imagined Zemmis 's father arranging a trust fund in a Sarasota bank . She looked in the mirror over the ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left a white dot on her nose and fine white stripes on her cheeks . <p> Jean 's gut feeling about Zemmis switched from apprehension to awe . She was n't sure which intuition was right . She put aside the notion that he was the rabbi 's excommunicated son , and considered the possibility that Zemmis was the Messiah himself . Jean did n't know much about theology , but it was certainly the right time of year for the Christ . She put on a fresh coat of makeup . He could also be the excommunicated son of Bonnie and Clyde . <p> By the time she returned to the table , Zemmis was gone . He faced a long trip to Long Island , Claude said , and did n't want to chance missing the train . Jean squinted at her glass to see if , as a farewell signal , Zemmis had guzzled her wine . " Not to worry , he knows how to reach us , " Edith said soothingly . " Claude and I gave him our cards . " <p> Claude and Edith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped , leaving a gleaming patina on the previously filthy streets . At home , tiptoing around her sleeping husband , Jean peered out the bedroom window to gauge its distance from Potter 's House . She knew it would be stupid from now on to draw open the curtains . But some gesture of good will seemed in order tonight . After rooting around for the right one , Jean put an unlit candle in a goblet and a striped sock filled with catnip on the windowsill . Tomorrow she would install a window gate . <p> As always , the morning 's drama revolved around the melon , last night 's honeydew . As soon as Jean cut into it , she knew it was dry . She cut a slice for her husband , who crooned with enjoyment when he tasted it . For a melon that was hard as nails , he said , it was unexpectedly sweet . <p> <p> By JANET COLEMAN <p>
