Captain Jean-Luc Picard is building up a head of righteous steam about the Borg , the evil race that once enslaved Picard and has now infested the Starship Enterprise with plans to do something very naughty to Planet Earth . Well , the Captain will not abandon ship . He will face up to the Borg , he says . " And I will make them pay for what they 've done . " As Patrick Stewart delivers this line with a majestic ferocity worthy of a Royal Shakespeare Company alumnus , the audience gapes in awe at a special effect more imposing than any ILM digital doodle . Here is real acting ! In a Star Trek film ! From the successor to William Shatner ! <P> This is just one of the small wonders in Star Trek : First Contact , eighth in the big-screen series and second with the crew of Star Trek : The Next Generation . Here , for a change , is an action movie that takes its subject but not itself seriously . It has a theme : the temptation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary you . It borrows not only from the Trek canon , but from other science fiction ( eek !  --  there 's a killer alien on board ! ) . Yet First Contact is no grab bag of camp gewgaws ; it stands proud and apart , accessible even to the Trek-deficient . This old Star , it seems , has a lot of life in it . <P> In the script by Rick Berman , Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore , the Enterprise is sailing through space , with its Frisbee contours and fabulous tail fins , toward mop-up duty in the Federation 's war against its ugliest nemesis . The Borg are flying back to the 21st century to prevent the first rendezvous between humans and benevolent extraterrestrials , then to " assimilate " all earthlings and turn them into crusty , cranky robots . Picard , who has been denied active duty for the very reason he needs to fight  --  because of his earlier assimilation by the Borg  --  disobeys orders and , y'know , saves the galaxy . But not before his android Data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borg ( Alice Krige ) . <P> Under the suave direction of Jonathan Frakes , who also plays the Enterprise 's second-in-command , the movie glides along with purpose and style . It also allows for a fun detour into a " holographic novel " set in the dear Deco days of Indiana Jones . But it 's mainly a three-way tug of souls among Picard , Data and the queen of all the Borg . When she whispers to her onetime conquest Picard , " You ca n't begin to imagine the life you denied yourself , " she opens the movie up to the ache of memory  --  to a good man 's second thoughts when he considers the road not taken , even if it 's the road to Hell . <P> For their sequel , the Next Generation stalwarts will do battle with a creature even meaner and mouthier than the Borg : the McEnroe . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
