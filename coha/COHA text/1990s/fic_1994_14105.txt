A small-town dump and junkyard , its mounds and valleys of debris slightly steaming in the rose of the sunset . Piles of cans , boxes , barrels , the rusted hulk of an old car , broken bedsteads , refrigerators , garbage , old signs , mounds of the unimaginable . The effect created is a dark , eccentric , contemporary hell . On top of the junked car , a young woman in a short , red dress , with a snake tattoo coiling up her left arm from wrist to shoulder , sits cross-legged . Heat lightning flashes in the distance . Far away , thunder rolls . R. V. Moon ? Yo , Moon , can you hear me down there ? Down , down , in that river of sleep ? Down with one foot in the dark continent ? You remember that day , Moon ? You know the one I mean . Old guy leans over , touches my tattoo , says , " Hey , Snake , we got a no-hitter goin ' , woman ; we 're workin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) They say there 's an hour in everybody 's life where all the luck you shoulda had comes together like drops on the windshield . You ever hear that ? State championship high school game , and all the luck we 'd never have again just riding your arm through the late afternoon . Roy , he was four for four ; Clem caught that relay bare-handed for the double play . And there you were , right into the eighth , throwin ' smoke and sinkers like Mr. Smooth in the bigs . And then , just then , some tanked-up dickwad on the third base side yells out , " Workin ' a no-hitter , Moon ! " And you froze stiff in your windup and looked over there like he woke you up from an afternoon nap , and then you shook your head and threw fourteen straight , fat ones up there , and they put five runs on the board . I could n't believe it , Moon . ( Thunder nearer ; a dog howling . ) Omens and portents . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' weep . ( She knocks on the car top . ) What the hell were you doin ' , Moon ? How come you threw it away ? ( Roy Mannering , a man in his late 40s , appears over the ridge of the dump . He is dressed as Abraham Lincoln , including beard and stovepipe hat . Roy carries two six-packs of beer . He looks down and yells a name , apparently not noticing R.V. ) p. 3 ROY Clem ? You here , Clem ? ( To himself . ) What damn color is that sky ? ( He takes a step forward and falls ass-over-teakettle down the dump 's incline . ) Well , that 's just perfect . That 's just sweet as hell . Clem ? ( The girl has disappeared . He wipes at his clothes with a handkerchief . ) ROY What is this stuff ? Oh , that 's perfect . ( He pulls out a portable phone and dials . ) Mona ? Mona , it 's Roy . What 's with the voice , Mona ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you better not because I 'm sick of it , woman , that 's why . Listen , Mona , go to the closet you got any mascara on your hands ? Well , you wash them off , go to the closet , get my gray silk summer suit gray suit stop cryin ' , Mona run that gray suit up to the July 4th reviewing stand because I got-nasty stuff on the Abe Lincoln suit Mona , I ca n't give the Gettysburg Address covered in dog shit . Now give that gray suit to Luellen my assistant Luellen I am not sleepin ' with Luellen , Mona she is one year out of high school what the hell are you cryin ' about , I put your Prozac right where you could see it . Now I need that suit , woman ; you do what I tell you . ( He cuts her off the phone . ) I ca n't stand that damn cryin ' . ( He dials again . ) Luellen , sweetmeat , it 's Long Dong Silver . You got any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese do n't know what U.P.S . means . Well , we 'll shoot what we got . Listen , I 'll be there forty , forty-five minutes , max . ( Feels beard . ) Yeah , I got it on . This stick-on stuff stings like hell . Look , tell Carl keep the high school band a couple extra numbers ' cause we 're missin ' those Chinese fireworks . Well , you tell him to do it . I 'm the damned mayor ! ( Puts phone back in pocket . A man appears above . It is Roy 's younger brother Clem . He wears overalls and a work shirt , and carries an umbrella. ) p. 4 CLEM That you , Roy ? ( Roy startles . ) ROY Damn , Clem . CLEM I tried not to scare you . ROY ( Scraping at his pants . ) Look at this ? What are we doin ' in the dump , Clem ? What the hell are we doin ' here ? CLEM We promised her , Roy . It 's a sacred trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sacred trust . CLEM I get it . You 're dressed up as a Smith Brothers cough drop . ROY This is Abe Lincoln , Clem . CLEM Oh , I see . ROY Seventy-five dollar rental , and I fell down the hill . CLEM Abe Lincoln , sure . We promised R.V. we 'd come down here every ten years . ROY I know that , Clem . CLEM Twenty years ago today . You want some Cheezits ? ROY ( Another matter . ) Clem , I got to talk to you . CLEM It 's Mama 's birthday , too . ROY What ? p. 5 CLEM I know , you never like to think of her dead . ROY Our beautiful Mama . CLEM ' Member how she always called you " Tiny " ? ROY Mama 's birthday ! Why did she leave us , Clem ? CLEM She died , Roy . ROY I know she died , goddamnit . CLEM Our two beautiful ladies in the heavenly choir . ROY I miss you , Mama ! CLEM Mama and R.V. Makes this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear anything from Moon ? CLEM Ca n't make it . Wired R.V. a dozen white roses , just like when we did this in ' 84 . ROY Well , I knew little brother would n't show . Where was the roses wired at ? CLEM Liberia . ROY Well , brother Moon , he 's seen the world . Has n't built a damn thing . Has n't been a damn thing . White roses every ten years . I 'm surprised he had the money . CLEM R.V. loved him . ROY She loved me. p. 6 CLEM Well , Roy , I 'd have to say ROY I do n't want to hear it ! Three brothers , Clem , but everybody thought he was pure gold , did n't they ? CLEM Oh , they did . ROY Well , I 'm the gold and you 're the gold , an ' he 's down in Liberia washing out his clothes in a stream full of fecal matter . CLEM I miss old Moon . He sure does love to kill people . ROY He always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugs , birds , squirrels , wild dogs he just grew up , that 's all . Clem , I got a time problem CLEM Well , we 'll do the toast . ROY There 's somethin ' else , Clem . CLEM What , Roy ? ROY A real bad sign . CLEM Bad signs , that 's right . You know that palomino horse old Gifford keeps out at four corners ? Drivin ' over here , seen that horse run mad , goes straight into the barbed wire , tangles himself up , goes to screamin ' , blood gettin ' throwed up into the air , most horrible thing I ever saw , plus everybody 's gettin ' boils , the creek 's turned red , and there 's piles a dead frogs right downtown p. 7 ROY ( Hands him a letter . ) I 'm not talkin ' about that kind of sign , Clem . CLEM There 's been three cases of rabid bats ROY Just read the letter , Clem . ( Clem opens it . ) ROY I 'm not worryin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' about re-election , Clem . CLEM ( Referring to the letter . ) So the newspaper guy knows about the chemicals ? ( So what ? ) ROY What chemicals ? CLEM ( Indicating the barrels stage right . ) Well these ones . ROY They are food additives , Clem , not chemicals . CLEM Food additives . ROY I got the letter , I went over to the newspaper . Now that pissant editor has a load receipt from Long Island Petrochemical tells him how many barrels of this , how many barrels of that they sent down here . CLEM Food additives . ROY Food additives , that 's right . I explained we have no barrel leakage or groundwater problem on the site . I explained the value of the contract to the city ; Hell , it 's 37 percent of the municipal income , you 'd think a damn moron could understand the economics , but he reads me a state statute says four of these additives  --  chloroethylene , hexochlorobenzine , polychlorinated biphenyls and somethin ' else  --  are prohibited from interstate transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that is . Now where do you think he got that load receipt ? p. 8 CLEM Well ROY You gave it to him . CLEM Well , he goes to our church , Roy . ROY You gave it to him . CLEM Well , he said , since it got the town so much money , just how many barrels was it ? So I gave him the load receipt , and he was real impressed . ROY Now we got to go get it back . CLEM Why , Roy ? ROY So he ca n't put it in the paper . CLEM It 's just food additives , Roy . ROY Uh-huh , that 's one thing , plus you and me set up the haulage company . You ever hear of nepotism ? CLEM That 's a positive word around here . ROY Never mind , Clem . Luckily you rent him the building he 's in , so you got a key . CLEM Sure , but ROY I go get the fireworks started . I got to be there ' cause the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go pick up your key later on , we go on down to the newspaper , get that load receipt . CLEM Walk right in ? p. 9 ROY Uh-huh . CLEM That 's not burglary ? ROY It 's fixin ' the problem . CLEM I see . ROY Clem , there is America and there is not-America . America is the light . Not-America is the darkness . America is n't a place , Clem , it 's an idea . Right now Clem , America is n't America , Japan is America . The problem is to get America back in America . Now , Clem , this is the idea that is America : See the problem , fix the problem , that makes a new problem , fix that problem . Whoever does that the best is America , and right now it 's not America . Not-America , which right now is America , has two damn characteristics . Number one : fools . Fools , Clem , can not see the problem and can not fix the problem . These people are Democrats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong problem and tell the people who are fixing the right problem that they are short-sighted . For instance , Clem , let us posit this : The world 's greatest bomb defuser is defusing a hydrogen bomb planted by Arabs under the Speaker 's platform in the U.S. Senate . This is the only man who can defuse this bomb . He has defused bombs like this for years . Because fixing this problem is stressful , he is a chain-smoker . Not-America number two , the goddamn idealists , Clem , pulls that expert defuser off the job because of the danger to United States senators of secondary smoke , and Washington , D.C. blows up ! We are America , Clem  --  you , me , we fix the problem  --  but the forces of darkness , the non-America number one and the not-America number two is now America , and these not-Americans are saying the real Americans are the problem , which of course is the problem we , as real Americans , have to fix ! p. 10 CLEM We 're the real Americans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones ? ROY That 's right . ( Clem 's face crumples . He pulls out a flask . ) ROY Do n't you dare cry , Clem . You 're a big businessman . CLEM Then how come Evelyn left me ? ROY Because you drank her right out of the house . CLEM ( Taking a hit . ) I 'm a bad person . ROY You got a haulin ' business , you 're into real estate . You run Gunworld , Clem , the biggest handgun retail outfit in a three-state area . You 're a big success and you drive a damn Miata , how can you be a bad person ? CLEM Evelyn still has n't called , you know . She did n't call you , did she ? How the hell am I going to raise those boys ? They miss their mama . What kind of woman would run off like that and not even leave a note for those boys ? How could she do that ? ROY ( Handing him his handkerchief . ) She did it because women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantaged , with the objectivity of a collie dog . They hate all systems , all logic , all authority , and any damn evidence runs contrary to their damn feelings . You take out the sex drive , there is n't one man in a million would stay in a house with ' em for forty-eight hours . ( Clem weeps. ) p. 11 ROY Stop cryin ' , goddamnit . CLEM Jimmy Peaslee ROY What ? CLEM His mama is the daughter of that woman used to run the Cherokee Diner . ROY I got the Gettysburg Address in twenty minutes . I got some colored lawyer dead even in the polls CLEM Jimmy Peaslee took a gun to school , tried to shoot his second-grade teacher . ROY When ? CLEM Yesterday . An AK-47 . He fired off a burst , but it went wild ROY Down at Lincoln Elementary ? CLEM Said his teacher was a damn lesbian . ROY Was she ? CLEM I think she just wore a pantsuit . ROY We would n't have this kind of problem if we had prayer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn toast . CLEM ( Heedless . ) That weapon come from Gunworld . It was mine , Roy . ROY You sold it to the boy ? CLEM To the daddy . ROY So ? p. 12 CLEM I feel real guilty , Roy . ( He weeps . ) ROY Clem , I got 1,500 , maybe 2,000 people showin ' up for my fireworks show , and due to the Chinese I got five , six minutes of fireworks , tops . My wife 's on a cryin ' jag , I got a little girl on the side is gettin ' real pushy , I got to break into the newspaper , I 'm runnin ' against a damn minority , and my Lincoln suit is covered with dog shit . You do n't have a problem , Clem . You sold a legal weapon to a legal daddy , and if he is so damn dumb he leaves it where Junior can get it , it sure as hell is not your fault . Democracy honors the individual , Clem , at the cost of givin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle the responsibility , the state ought to castrate him so he ca n't mess up his kid ! Plus you do n't even know she was n't a lesbian . CLEM You explained that real fine , Roy . ROY That 's right . Now , I got to go to the fireworks . You meet me right after behind the Dairy Freeze . Bring the keys and a ski mask . ( He starts out of the dump . ) CLEM What about the sacred trust ? ROY I do n't have time for the sacred trust . ( Starts out . ) CLEM She was your wife , Roy . p. 13 ROY That was twenty damn years ago ! CLEM My wife left me , Roy . ( Weeping . ) My Evelyn left me ! ( Roy stops . ) ROY Goddamnit Clem , you 're gettin ' me homicidal . ( Clem weeps . ) If I do the toast , will you stop cryin ' ? ! CLEM You 'll keep the sacred trust ? ROY I will keep the goddamn , sonofabitchin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you understand me ? CLEM You 're a prince , Roy . You want some Cheezits ? ROY Do it ! ( He comes back down . ) CLEM ( Looking up . ) R.V. ? It 's me , Clem . I 'm here with Roy , in the dump . It 's about 8:30 . Sky 's a real funny color . ROY You gon na do a weather report , Clem ? CLEM Right , right . ROY Four minutes . CLEM So , R.V. , it 's Clem . I 'm here with Roy in the dump . ROY You 're drivin ' me apeshit . CLEM R.V. , we 're here like we promised . Roy , me well , Moon , he 's tied up with fecal matter . Boy , I miss your shinin ' face . You never loved me . Was n't your fault . I know you loved Moon . I believe you loved Roy here mainly . I do n't know why you killed yourself , but that was just the worst thing ever happened to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death note would we hoist a beer every ten years on the pitcher 's mount where we almost got to be state champs an ' you sang the National Anthem . See , they sold the field for a dump site when they combined the high school over to Mayberry. p. 14 ROY One minute . CLEM ( Quickly . ) I can still hear your beautiful voice . So clear and high . Sounded like Snow White or Cinderella singin ' to the mice . Boy , I miss you , R.V. it 's just a dump now , but it 's a world of memories to me . ( He weeps . ) ROY Goddamn it , Clem . ( Clem stops . ) ROY R.V. ? You were a damn fine woman with beautiful breasts and a good sense of humor . We should n't have got married with you still stuck on Moon , but that 's 20-20 hindsight . You knew what a man is , but you did n't throw it in his face . You were mentally unbalanced , but you never let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my book . ( A middle-aged woman , Roy 's wife Mona , wearing only a slip , high heels , and a strand of pearls around her neck , appears on the ridge behind them . She carries a pistol . ) ROY You are my damn baby , R.V. honey , and any woman since you 've gone is just passin ' the time . ( At this moment , Mona on the ridge raises the pistol and fires down on Roy . He and Clem scramble . Simultaneously : ) ROY Hold it . CLEM Do n't shoot . p. 15 MONA ( Holding Roy 's gray suit on a hanger in her other hand . ) You are my nightmare , Roy Mannering ! ( She fires again . ) You are a maggot b-b-born in the dung , b-burrowed down in my flesh eating me alive ! I hitchhiked out here , so here 's your g-g-gray suit ! ( She flings it down into the dump . ) ROY You hitchhiked in your underwear ? ( She fires again . ) ROY Mona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c-curse you , Roy . I c-call demons from their d-dank c-caves and crevices the c-creatures of the night to g-give you prostate cancer and Lou G-Gehrig 's disease , and make you impotent that one t-time every c-couple of months you can still get it up . ROY You 've got to relax if you want to stop stuttering , Mona . ( She fires again . ) MONA Your teenage whore assistant called me up to say you were t-taking her to the Mayor 's c-c-c-c-c-conference next week . She said you b-bought her a sapphire and d-d-diamond ring . Said you were divorcing me and m-m-m-m-marrying her . She said you called me a c-c-corpse with jewelry , Roy . Well , I am . I am eaten up with l-l-loathing for m-myself , and you taught m-me that with your fiendish c-c-c-criticism and little jokes and p-patronizing ways . I looked in the mirror t-t-tonight and I saw my b-bleached b-brain an ' my d-dead eyes an ' I said Mona , what b-became of you ? Where are you , Mona ? ( The door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon , dressed in jeans and a skull T-shirt with an army field jacket over it , boots , and an old kerchief around his head , steps out . He is bearded and in every way piratical. ) p. 16 MONA I curse your sons and your sons ' sons that they should be b-born without testicles , blind as newts , and they should disinter your corpse and rifle through your pockets for spare change . Now I 'm going to shoot your p-puffy head off , and that will make me feel considerably better . ( She raises the gun again . ) MOON ( In his left hand , he carries a stubby full automatic as if it were an extension of his arm . As she raises the gun , he speaks consolingly . ) Good evening , ma'am . ( She turns , pointing the gun at him . ) I had a friend used to stutter until his confidence caught up with his heart . CLEM Moon . MOON How you doin ' ? Well ma'am , I 'd have to agree with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks you 're a household appliance . He just do n't know what a woman is , ma'am , and he 's just unteachable as a rooster . ROY What the hell , Moon ? MOON Shut up , Roy . Now ma'am , I 'm a brute killer for pay , and they tell me I 'm one of the dozen best shots in the world , left-handed or right . May I call you Mona ? Mona , what you 're holdin ' there is a Rossi 518 Tiger Cat Special , accurate up to about 40 feet and , combined with your understandable emotion and inexperience , you most likely wo n't hit me , whereas , my first couple of rounds will tear off your wrist , leavin ' you with one hand for the rest of your life . They tell me the pain 's unendurable unless we cauterized it with fire , and by the time we got some kindlin ' , you 'd likely bleed to death . It 's strange when you can see right inside your own body like you can when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are because we 're covered with skin . Once you find out , you realize we 're just walkin ' meat . Now I 'd feel more comfortable if you 'd point that thing at Roy , if you do n't mind . ( She does. ) p. 17 ROY Damn , Moon . MOON Well I feel a whole lot better . Much obliged . Now what can we do for you , ma'am ? MONA K-K-K-Kill him . ROY Moon ? MOON ( To Roy . ) There 's no punishment in death , ma'am . It 's over in the blink of an eye . The thing I like least about killin ' people is how easy they get off . Hell , he stole your life from you . Would n't you say that 's the situation ? MONA I was I was I had dreams . MOON Sure , I know . You got some place you could go ? MONA Clem 's wife , Evelyn , she called from Arizona . CLEM Arizona ? MONA She says it 's n-nice . She l-lives with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could c-c-come out there . MOON You know what you get out there , ma'am ? You get yourself a shadow , so you do n't get lonely . MONA But I do n't have the money . He did n't let me work . MOON Well see , he is so small . He is such a small person he could only enlarge himself at your expense . p. 18 ROY Now that 's just damned well enough . MOON She 's going to kill you , Roy , we 're lookin ' for alternatives . ROY She ca n't hit the side of a barn . MOON She is n't stuttering , Roy . Her hand 's steady . You ought to hold that with two hands , ma'am . Sort of like this . ( He demonstrates . She changes her grip . ) ROY Dammit ! MOON She might get lucky , put one right up your nose . ROY I do n't know you . MOON Ma'am , I believe I 'm goin ' to take up a collection , how about that ? Gim me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) MOON I said gim me your goddamn wallets ! ( They throw them on the ground . ) MOON I get real pissed off at myself , the course I 've taken . I should have got into robbery , it 's just so damn easy . ( Picks them up . He looks . ) You wo n't mind if your pretty wife goes on a little shoppin ' spree , will you , Roy ? ( Roy glowers . ) MOON So now I 'm comin ' up there , ma'am . Roy , throw me over your car keys , will you ? p. 19 ROY I am not givin ' you my car keys . MOON What are you drivin ' these days ? ROY No way , No damn way . MOON Go ahead , ma'am , shoot him . ( She fires . Roy hits the ground . She misses . ) ROY Goddammit to hell . Son of a bitch . MOON That was about a foot left , ma'am . And if you would n't mind a little advice , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the gut . ROY Alright . Alright . I 'm gettin ' the keys . MOON How are you doin ' , Clem ? CLEM Well , Evelyn run off . MOON Sorry to hear that . You better have a drink . CLEM ( Pulling out the flask . ) Okay , Moon . MOON There 's a case to be made for finishin ' the century blind drunk . CLEM Care for a dollop ? ( Clem , having taken a hit , passes the flask to Moon . ) MOON Well , I do n't mind . ( Drinks . ) How about you , Mona ? MONA ( A roar . ) I hate men ! p. 20 MOON Me too , ma'am . ( Drinks . ) ROY There . ( Tosses the keys . ) This is egregious damn car theft . MOON Tell him " Shut up , " ma'am . MONA Shut up ! MOON Here I come now . ( Starts up toward Mona . ) Just bringin ' the wallets and the car keys . Get you started , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at math . MOON Yes ma'am . MONA I was better than the boys . ( He nods . ) MOON Yes ma'am . MONA I could have done r-research on the universe . MOON Well , you 're still young , ma'am . MONA No , I 'm not . I 'm dried out . MOON ( Puts the wallets down near her . ) Well , you look a little chilly . You might like to put this around your shoulders . ( He puts his field jacket down on the ground . He looks off . ) Clem , are you drivin ' that Mazda Miata or the Chrysler ? CLEM I 'm the Mazda , Moon . p. 21 MOON Good for you , Roy , you bought American made . Hey , Clem , would she still take 79 South and then 64 West ? It 's been a long time . CLEM 64 to 44 , then take Interstate 40 west all the way . MOON Down to Arizona ? CLEM Yes sir , headin ' west . MOON Nice two-day drive . MONA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a good fire can only be made from seasoned wood . The point is n't to end the journey , the point is to make the journey . MONA I made the journey with you , Roy . I thought I would rest easy and you would care for me . I knew I was n't a beautiful , wild creature like that R.V. , but I thought we could make a quiet life , Roy . That 's a horse laugh . A woman 's just disposable goods to you . I gave myself over an ' forgot who I was , but those days are over and gone , Roy . I 'm makin ' my own movie now , and you 're just something in the rearview mirror to me . I let your tropical fish go free in the creek ; I burned your Louis L'Amour first editions , and I pushed your satellite dish off the roof . I 'm an outlaw now , Roy , no one will ever treat me that way again . MOON Louis L'Amour would despise you , Roy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belts ! Do it ! p. 22 CLEM I do n't have a belt , Moon . MOON Lie down on your stomachs . ( Takes off his own belt and , with Roy 's , expertly belts the two brothers ' hands behind them . ) It took me four planes , an oxcart , and I forded a river on a man 's back to get here , boys . Had to sell the gold teeth I 'd been collectin ' to get it done . See , I wanted to be here for R.V. , do a little business , see my big brothers , and take a little vacation from gettin ' people down on the ground and tyin ' them up with their belts . I guess it just shows you 're a prisoner of your talents . That is n't too tight , is it ? CLEM It feels real nice , Moon . MOON ( Looking over his handiwork . ) Well , okay ( Up to Mona . ) You might want to get started , ma'am . MONA Are you the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillaged and slaughtered ? MOON More or less . MONA Are you the worst of men ? I need a b-benchmark . MOON Well I do n't know , ma'am . I guess I 'm close enough to be competitive . MONA Then I 'll k-keep the pistol . p. 23 MOON Good idea . Say , you know what they do all over the world ? MONA Who ? MOON Those who have prevailed . Those who have brought their enemies to their knees and made them eat the dust of the road . It does n't matter if it 's Medellin or Kumasi or Kuala Lumpur , they fire their weapons in the air . They empty themselves into the universe in celebration . ( He hands her his automatic weapon . ) ROY My God , are you deranged ? ! MOON Go ahead , ma'am . ( Mona looks at him and then fires a long burst in the air . ) MOON Feels good , huh ? MONA It feels g-g-g-glorious ! ( She hands back the automatic , keeping the pistol . She smiles for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get goin ' , ma'am . Keep your mind real empty and close to hand , that 'll let it heal up . You might want to put on some clothes , but everybody 's got their own way . MONA Good-bye , Moon . MOON Adios , babe . MONA ( She turns to Roy and Clem . ) Good-bye , Clem . Good-bye , Roy . I 'm sorry I was such a bad shot . I 'm free now . When I 'm out in Arizona , I 'm going to take this money and raise b-bees . Millions of b-bees . Then with the aphrodisiac of my freedom , I will lure men to hotel rooms . I will tie them to the b-bed with silk scarves for a g-good time . Then I will place the queen b-bee on their penis and when they are completely covered with the swarm , I will leave them there to figure it out . ( She exits. ) p. 24 MOON Nice night , beautiful stars , minimum of snipers . That 's what I call perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How come you 're dressed up like an Amish farmer , Roy ? ROY Do you know what a divorce is goin ' to cost me ? MOON That 's just overhead , Roy , it was comin ' on anyway , you just have to amortize it . CLEM There 's ants in my shirt , Moon . MOON I 'm goin ' to smoke me a Cuban cigar , Clem . They roll these babies on the inside of a beautiful woman 's thigh . One of the few luxuries left . CLEM My wife left me too . MOON Everybody 's wife leaves , Clem , it 's a shit job . CLEM How am I goin ' to raise my boys ? MOON Just tell ' em to do the opposite . CLEM The opposite ? MOON I would n't worry about it , Clem . ( Moon lights up . ) ROY My own brother robbed me . MOON You can get on the phone and cancel the cards , they got all-night service . p. 25 ROY I 'm talkin ' about my car ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car , Roy , it 's just upholstery on wheels . ( Suddenly the dump is alive with movement . Small black shapes scurry everywhere . ) ROY My God , what 's that ? MOON Looks like the rats are leavin ' the dump , Roy . ROY Untie me , goddamnit . MOON I once saw rats eat a man alive . They ate him in circles like a corn dog . CLEM I 'm scared of rats , Moon . MOON ( Looks up at the stars . ) You both owe me money . ( Silence falls . ) ROY Now Moon , this is n't the time to talk about that . This is a time for three brothers , lost to each other by geography , to take hands , kneel down MOON You owe me for the fishing cabin Pop left me that you sold for me in ' 86 . ROY Moon , that cabin was in bad shape . MOON How much did you get for it ? ROY water damaged , rotted out . MOON How much , Roy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit less . MOON You sold 1.3 acres down on the river for $1,300 ? ROY Hey little brother , this was eight years ago . MOON It was appraised 20 years ago at $7,500 . ROY Are you accusing me of cheatin ' my own damn family ? MOON Yes . ROY There is no bond like blood , Moon , and there is nothing so despicable as to doubt it . CLEM Mighta been $5,000 , Moon . MOON That 's good , Clem , and when you started your pawnshop I fronted you $5,000 , which was ten percent of the capital . CLEM Would you care for some Cheezits , Moon ?
