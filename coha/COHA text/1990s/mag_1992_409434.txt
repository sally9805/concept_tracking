All pheasant hunters have felt the frustration of pursuing a bird that refuses to fly . But here are some tricks you can use to launch these gaudy gamebirds  --  without having to deploy an army of hunters . I 'd barely walked into one end of the cover when I saw them . The three cock pheasants had already stepped from the other side of the draw . They paced about for a while , heads upright and tails held arrogantly at half-mast . Rather than duck back into the shelter of the brush-choked drainage , the trio did what pheasants do best  --  they ran . With heads and tails clamped close to the ground , they crossed a two-track farm trail , looking like feathered armadillos as they entered a long strip of prairie grass . As it often does when I see running ringnecks , my mind turned to the Texan . I met the man and hunted with his " pointas " on the second day of his first pheasant hunt . Born and raised with the gentlemanly patience of bobwhite quail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pheasants . " These damn birds wo n't give my dogs a chance , " he half-screamed , the veins rising in his face like pipelines across the tundra . " How in the hell are you supposed to hunt birds that do n't play fair  --  they , they , they , RUN ! " Anyone who was raised in pheasant country can tell you pheasants are born to run . We see them running just days from the egg , fist-sized fuzzballs sprinting over and around dirt clods and grass clumps . And anyone who has sunk his teeth into the tendon and gristle-filled leg of a cooked autumn rooster knows that the bird 's running is a trait that intensifies with age . At one time or another , running pheasants have frustrated all who have hunted them . Many hunters head home in defeat . Others , those who are consistently successful , play the game by the ringneck 's rules  --  with deception and ingenuity . I and my hunting companions , renowned gun-fitter Michael Murphy and Chris Dorsey , author of Pheasant Days , moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coursings of the pair of retrievers that quartered in front of us . Talk was nonexistent . A maze of fresh pheasant tracks in the snow told the story well enough . Birds were running in the bluestem , buffalo and switch grasses , somewhere between us and the two orange specks that stood as blockers at the end of the field . Things began to happen when we were close enough to make out the faces of our blockers . The first rooster to flush tried to fly between the two , and one of the hunters , I 'm not sure which , cleanly folded the bird . Sensing the trap , several cockbirds wisely made side exits out of range of the walkers and blockers . Most of the birds , however , turned from runners to sitters , and the real excitement began . Scent filling their noses , the two retrievers thrashed their tails wildly as they plunged into the last 25 yards of cover . One second the sky was empty . The next it was full of pheasants . I responded with my usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then rebounding to drop a crossing rooster . Turning , I got to see how it should be done when Dorsey dropped a clean double . The other three shooters had connected also . As my golden retriever , Mysti , and Murphy 's Lab , Tasha , gleaned the area for the half-dozen downed birds and any late risers , I scanned the cover we 'd walked . Some of the pheasants had trotted a quarter-mile before falling into a perfect trap . But such setups do n't just happen . Those who successfully hunt pheasants , whether a red fox using its quickness or a sportsman with his shotgun , rely heavily on stealth and surprise . Over the years I 've watched thousands of pheasants flush from the middle of cover because they 've seen or heard the blockers moving into position . But the pheasants in the prairie grass patch on this Kansas hunt had no such warning . The blockers had circled widely , and had come in quietly and out of sight . Had they the opportunity , the blockers would have used natural cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a bush to break their outline while they waited . Because the ground was flat and covered with nothing but a waist-high carpet of grass , they stood statue-still and silent where the cover met a mowed path . Sometimes , however , the very end of the field is n't the best place to post a blocker . Pheasants will quite often flush where a cover makes a change in direction . For example , one of my favorite opening-day coverts is a meandering creek bottom . My hunting partner Mark Grinter learned long ago that the birds would streak along just inside the cover then flush at the corners where the covert made a bend . Through the years , he 's taken many limits by sneaking into position at such curves . Walkers need to show similar fore-thought and determination . The quickest way to ruin a good pheasant drive is to flush the birds out of range . In the best of situations , the walkers should enter a cover unseen and should work it with a minimum of noise . Loud talking or unnecessary shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the best of plans . And trying to pin down running pheasants is one case where more is n't always better . It seems like eight hunters make 10 times the commotion of four . A total of five guns is close to my maximum . A trio of hunters can work most covers well using two walkers moving towards a single blocker . A pair of coordinated gunners can be a deadly duo by working narrow covers such as treelines , ditches and the like . The standard walker/blocker tactic can work well , as can having both hunters moving towards each other . ( Remember , safety must be the primary concern when using blockers on a pheasant hunt . No matter how tempting , no straightforward shot should ever be taken because the bird could be in line with the blocker . ) Even a solo hunter can outmaneuver running pheasants by using a variety of ploys . One is to simply stay with them until they hold . A single hunter hustling to stay behind a good dog can eventually catch up with a surprising number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders as well . Not far from my central Kansas home lie the remains of an old railroad line . The rails and the ties are long gone , leaving a berm of brush , vines and weeds that runs between a field of corn stubble and a cattle feed lot . The dense cover and the abundance of grain make it a natural favorite for the long-tailed birds . But the clean , straight edges of the narrow covert , and the farmer 's request that I hunt only by myself , allowed two dozen or so pheasants to run ahead and flush out of range on my first try . Round two would be different . After some scheming , I came up with a plan that a friend dubbed " Operation Feathered Storm . " One cold and sunny morning , I brazenly parked at the end of the corn-stubble field . With the motor of my Bronco running , I committed every major sin a hunter can make as he enters a cover . I slammed my door , accidentally hit the horn , loudly talked of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Confident that I 'd telegraphed my position to every pheasant in the cover , I got back in the truck and quietly made an end-around drive and parked 150 yards from the western end of the cover . This time Mysti and I exited the Bronco quietly and sneaked toward the field . Reaching the top of the berm , I instantly knew that the ruse had worked . Two cockbirds were within 100 yards and running fast  --  away from the decoy commotion to the east and right at me ! One bird flushed and flew out of range , while the other dove into the depths of a nearby tangle . Mysti was just seconds behind him , ferreting out his trail in the brush while I opted for the easy walking of the gravel berm . About 25 yards away , Mysti rooted the pheasant from a clump of weeds . The shot was easy . The only thing that kept me from a quick limit of four birds was a comedy of errors . Roosters flew dead-on into the sun , I hurried a shot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird . All in all , I managed to down a pair of roosters out of six opportunities . Without the deception I may never have had a single chance . Though there is no way to figure out what 's going on in the pea-size brain of a rooster pheasant , you can often predict the situations in which pheasants are most likely to run , and when the birds will be more likely to hold . Weather can be a major factor . Fill the sky with clouds , cover the ground with snow and drop the temperature to well below freezing , and the birds that sprinted like antelope when it was warm will probably hold as tight as stones . Let the weather turn to sunny and 70 deg , however , and the birds will probably become as footloose as fraternity brothers on spring break . The cover that the birds are keeping can be a determining factor as well . Long , linear covers like row crop fields and shelterbelts are as conducive to running pheasants as an open highway is to speeding Porsches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicket even a snake would struggle through , there are dense covers where the birds are more likely to hold . Hunting such an area can make for tough , laborious walking , but it is quite often worth the effort . We continued to play a game of chase with the Kansas pheasants the rest of the morning and into the afternoon . The later it got , the more skittish the birds became . They could simply run too easily in the grass and the draws . " We ca n't stop them from running , " said J.R . Dienst , the owner of the land we were hunting . " But I do have some places where it 'll be a little tougher for them  --  and for us . " We quickly cruised some of Dienst 's 30,000 plus acres of managed habitat looking for one last field of the day . Dienst finally led us to " the jungle . " During the summer and the early fall the vast field of cane created by the federal government 's Conservation Reserve Program had stood higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of snows , ice storms and the constant pounding of the wind had the field knee-high at the highest by early January . " They have everything they need here , " said Dienst . " There are tons of food and plenty of cover . Hopefully the cover is thick enough near the ground that they 'll have to slow down a little . Even if they do run , we 'll be able to keep up and the open green wheat fields around us should hold them tight at the end . " We started at the southwestern end , moving in a 100-yard swath eastward toward a blocker . The first pass drew only a few hen flushes . We turned west again and took a new chunk from the field . Half-way through that pass Mysti hit pay dirt , pushing five roosters and as many hens into the sky from a tangle of cane . Amazingly , all five cockbirds fell . Fifty yards away , Murphy 's Lab flushed a long-spurred two-year-old that we 'd already walked past . The dog 's owner connected on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , moving from east to west while gradually creeping northward with each pass . The combination of a setting sun and sore muscles forced us to quit a single bird short of our collective limit of 20 cockbirds . All five hunters were overjoyed with the day . Dienst was even more ecstatic with the promise of the next day . " Believe me , " he said , " for every bird that 's flushed another two or three have been pushing north on us . We 'll get on them tomorrow morning before they have a chance to scatter . " We were back at " the jungle " early the next morning , starting exactly where we 'd left off . The first rooster of the morning flushed five minutes into the hunt . It was an omen of things to come . The farther we progressed to the north , the tougher the walking became . A month of northerly winds had been stacking tumbleweeds into the northern third of the field . The tumbleweeds looked like a mass of cockleburs stuck in a setter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hunters who had to high step their way through the tangles . The pheasants were keeping us too busy . Pheasants tired of the constant pressure rose out of range . Enough abandoned their running game and tried to sit tight , only to be flushed by one of the trio of dogs . Finally we found ourselves heading into the final corner of the field . Pheasant tracks littered the ground . Fifty yards from where the blocker stood , birds began flushing like popcorn . It started with a single flush , seconds later a pair rose , then a feathered melee erupted . Shouts of " rooster , rooster , rooster , " came from every direction while our eyes searched the sky in front of us , trying to separate the gaudy cockbirds from the drab hens . Within seconds , someone was yelling " No more , we 're limited ! " But the birds we 'd herded to the northeastern corner of the field were rising long after that last shell had been unloaded . Mysti flushed another rooster as she came trotting back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooster when she passed a small tuft of wheat 20 yards from the cane . No doubt the bird was still trying to do what he was born to do  --  run  --  even in the shoe-top high wheat . The other four hunters were jabbering like children who 'd just demolished a mountain of Christmas packages . Talk was of good shots , bad shots , great dog work and , of course , the hundreds ( yes , hundreds ! ) of pheasants we 'd seen . But my mind again turned to the red-faced Texan who 'd thrown every unprintable word imaginable at pheasants . " You bet they run , " I thought as I took the last bird from Mysti . " And they do n't play fair . I would n't have it any other way . Success is at its sweetest when it 's earned . " <p>
