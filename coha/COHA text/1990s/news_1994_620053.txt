<p> Ruben Vargas has power . He also has a problem . The degree of his success or failure will heavily influence the fate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) in Sunday 's elections . <p> As political organizing chief of the National Union Movement , which represents all Mexico 's 2.4 million federal , state and local government workers , Vargas is trying hard to keep the PRI 's most faithful , lockstep constituency in line . <p> Using a combination of persuasion and coercion to rally the rank- and-file , Vargas and the rest of the nation 's pro-PRI unions are a key element in the PRI 's enormously effective campaign machine . <p> " We are firmly committed to the PRI and its ( presidential ) candidate , Dr. Ernesto Zedillo , " he said . But whether his members will continue to heed that commitment to the party is an open question . <p> Zedillo leads his opponents by wide margins in most polls , and his strength is shown clearly on the streets . In campaign rally after campaign rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative candidate Diego Fernandez or the left-of-center Cuauhtemoc Cardenas . <p> On Sunday in Mexico City 's downtown , more than 150,000 people  --  at least as many as those who showed up for two rallies held by Fernandez and Cardenas in the same place the day before  --  gathered to hear a short but upbeat speech from Zedillo . He called for " democracy with dignity " and predicted " a clear majority and a clear mandate . " <p> The crowd included both true enthusiasts and others with more dubious motivations . <p> " Zedillo is the only choice , " said small business owner Juan Medina , 34 , standing at the corner of the Zocalo . " He 's the option for stability and peace . The PRI is going to win , there 's no question . " <p> But not far away , a woman with a sign from the Colosio Brigade  --  a party organization named after the slain PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio  --  looked bewildered when asked why she was at the rally . <p> " I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding toward a cluster of signs . <p> FREE LUNCHES <p> Nearby , a minivan where officials were handing out lunch packets of fried chicken , juice , an apple and a brownie was mobbed . <p> " The secretary ( of the union ) said we can go now , " said a construction worker who was walking away from the rally , lunch in hand . He declined to give his name or say who he would vote for . <p> As Zedillo led a deafening chant of " We 're going to win ! " and thousands of helium balloons in the red , white and green of the PRI and the Mexican flag rose into the sky , the man said that any worker who did not attend the rally would be docked two days ' pay . Others at the rally also said they had been given monetary incentives to come . <p> A woman who said she sells neckties in a subway station reported , " The delegate ( of the vendors ' union ) said we would lose our permits if we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she will " probably " vote for the PRI . <p> RENT-A-CROWD <p> Although PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo has repeatedly pledged to wean the party from its long-time reliance on union and peasant organizations and to end its tradition of " acarreo "  --  a Mexican term roughly translatable as " rent-a-crowd "  --  he appears to have made little headway . <p> Vargas denied that his unions use coercion , saying , " We completely respect our members ' diversity of opinions . All political activity is voluntary . " <p> He added , however , that " different unions are at different phases in the modernization and reform process . " He refused to elaborate . <p> Despite the government 's adoption of free-trade , free-market policies , the importance of labor unions to the PRI can not be underestimated . <p> About 10 million Mexicans , 40 percent of the nation 's nonagricultural workforce , are organized in unions that are formally affiliated with the PRI . Non-PRI unions represent less than 100,000 workers , and complain bitterly that government authorities and employers alike automatically repress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone suspected of dissident union activity . <p> LABOR GAINS <p> Vargas boasted that his unions had negotiated comfortable benefit packages for workers , including six weeks vacation and frequent handouts of merchandise on such occasions as Mother 's Day , Father 's Day and the beginning of the school year . <p> But he admitted that Mexico 's anti-inflationary austerity policies in recent years have hurt government workers ' paychecks , which average about $ 300 per month , and have cut into support for the PRI . <p> " We have repeatedly made clear to Dr. Zedillo that salaries must be allowed to recuperate , " he said . " He appears concerned about the situation . " <p> Zedillo appears to be taking the warnings seriously . Although PRI critics say Zedillo merely represents more of the same tough austerity policies of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , Zedillo has subtly criticized Salinas ' policies throughout his campaign . <p> ZEDILLO 'S PLATFORM <p> In a sign of what many observers say is the PRI 's saving grace  --  flexibility mixed with opportunism  --  Zedillo has said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . <p> At campaign stop after campaign stop , he has emphasized his commitment to fight poverty . Significantly , he has almost never mentioned Salinas ' crowning achievement  --  the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement . And he has promised " total cleansing " of the justice system , criticizing corruption in the police and judiciary . <p> The reform tactic has come at a convenient time , when public skepticism about government promises has reached an all-time high . The outbreak of guerrilla warfare in Chiapas has deflated the government 's triumphalistic rhetoric about NAFTA , and the assassination of Colosio has made many Mexicans suspect a feud within the PRI between reformers and hard-liners . <p> " The PRI has been in power for 65 years precisely because it has had the wisdom to be flexible , " said Jose Angel Gurria , the PRI 's secretary of international relations . " At the same time , as we remain true to our principles of nationalism , the free market and social justice , we have known how to adapt to the times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weather vane , the PRI 's slick , well- financed campaign machine has changed Zedillo from a stiff , conservative technocrat into a populist , crowd-pleasing baby-kisser . <p> When he was named to replace Colosio in March , Zedillo was seen as a public relations disaster : a Yale-educated economist and former cabinet minister more at home with international bankers than with the average Mexican . <p> Since then , his formerly shrill speaking style has loosened up , and his TV ads have become masterful , Ronald Reagan-style confidential chats . <p> PRI campaign officials  --  clearly in control of their candidate , rather than the other way around  --  have subjected Zedillo to a grueling initiation into Mexican political realities . He has endured innumerable meetings with the poorest of the poor : inner-city gang members , peasants hit hard by free trade , glue-sniffing orphans , unemployed workers . <p> At the same time , he has continued to stroke the PRI 's strategic constituencies : members of PRI unions and peasant organizations and wealthy businessmen who have donated heavily to his campaign . <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file campaign spending reports until two months after election day . But it is clear that thanks to the PRI 's traditionally bottomless campaign coffers , Zedillo has overwhelmingly outspent Fernandez and Cardenas . <p> RELENTLESS ADVERTISING <p> The PRI has dominated every advertising outlet , from prime- time television to walls in urban barrios . It has enlisted hundreds of thousands of door-to-door canvassers and given away millions of trinkets , from T-shirts to baseball caps . And the highly favorable coverage granted the PRI by the television giant Televisa has left ordinary Mexicans little sense of what Fernandez and Cardenas stand for . <p> " Zedillo appears to have truly changed since he became candidate , " said Jorge G. Castaneda , an influential political analyst and professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico . " For example , his economic criticisms ( of Salinas ' policies ) seem partly sincere . . . . But the machine is still as corrupt as ever . It 's not at all clear whether he will have any decisive impact on it .
