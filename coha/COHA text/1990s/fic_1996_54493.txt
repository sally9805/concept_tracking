THE GROUP OF NEW-HIRES crowded together on a concrete slab that had once been part of a beachfront parking lot . Javier Gonzalez stood in front , pressing against the chain-link fence as he squinted at the sea . Waves made horizontal lines of light across the gray-blue water , cut by the wake of the boat from Tierra Flores Island . Gulls wheeled overhead , screeching . <p> Further south , aluminum-hulled dinghies bobbed at the public pier . Illegals used them to net croaker and sculpin , scavenger fish too polluted for the regular markets . Behind the rows of crumbling , sunbleached hotels , enclosed pedestrian corridors stretched from the West City mall plexes to the private filtered bathing areas . But here on the landing , the only sunscreens were tin slats that stank of bird shit . Strips of burning light fell across the rusting benches . The seats had all been taken hours ago by men who did n't have jobs on the Island but were hoping for an inside tip that might lead to one . <p> Some of the new-hires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say goodbye . Javier 's mother and sister had come with him on the electric tram from the East City barrio , but he 'd already sent them back again . <p> Mama had pulled away from him , leaving a film of sweat where they touched . Her eyes flashed , a ring of white around black . He wondered why she should be afraid now . All those years , he could have run with the cartel or been gunned down by them , or been zeroed out by drugs or lung crud . He could have blown his brains out like so many of his friends . But he had n't . He was clean and mostly whole and now he 'd landed a job  --  a real job . <p> Her plastic sandals scuffing the sand-gritted concrete , his sister , Ana , had followed Mama back into the glaring street , the baby sleeping exhausted on her shoulder . Blood spattered its lips where it had been coughing . Ana acted as if the baby were dead already , like the last one . Javier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . Sometimes she hurt so much it made her crazy . <p> He would take care of her and the baby , too . There was no one else , not after her husband got caught in the crossfire of a cartel raid . <p> Javier looked from the boat to the crumbling beach town . He imagined what it would be like to be on that boat , coming back with cash and a second-class citizenship . Maybe something extra , some love-gift from a rich Angla . He 'd seen how the barrio girls watched him through their eyelashes as he walked down streets at night . His hips were hard and slim , his skin honey-gold , a little reddish this past week as if he 'd been careless enough to go out in the open sun , which puzzled him a little . But he did n't mind . Women liked a man who lived dangerously . <p> The boat nudged up against the inflated bumpers of the pier , wide and white with its sunshaded deck , indoor cabins , its tablecloths and flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasols by the green-uniformed crew to the limo parked beyond the guest gazebo . The man wore a protective jumpsuit and the women , billowy caftans of peacock and rose-colored silk . Metallicized wraparounds hid their eyes . <p> The silk-robed women disappeared into the limo and the man beside Javier whistled under his breath . He was skinny and blond and his cheap boots bore a snakeskin pattern right down to the tips of the sharply tapered toes . " I hear that rich pussy is hot , real hot , " he said . " I 'm gon na get me some . Screw ' em so hard their eyeballs pop out . " <p> Javier shook his head in disgust . " Shit , man , did n't nobody teach you how to treat your women ? " <p> The hopefuls pricked their ears like slum rats scenting blood . <p> " Better than you , barrio trash , " Pointy-Toes shot back . <p> Javier grabbed a fistful of Pointy-Toes 's shirt and spun him around , slammed his back against the fence . The metal links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in patches . His lips drew back from his clenched teeth . <p> " Button it and keep it buttoned , you two ! " One of the crew unlocked the gate and swung it open . " What 's the matter , you trying to get yourselves fired before you even start ? " <p> Pointy-Toes 's fist was inches from Javier 's nose , his bared forearm gleaming with body oil and sweat . The veins stood out sharply . <p> Blood that close to the skin , it spills real easy , Javier thought . He 'd seen enough of his own to know . <p> Heart pounding , Javier reminded himself why the hopefuls gathered at the docks every morning . Some days , they said , two out of three new-hires got sent back . But not me . I 'm gon na be the one who makes it . He opened his hand and let Pointy-Toes pull free . <p> Javier showed the crewman his job-offer papers along with the other new-hires . The crewman closed the gate after them and locked it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whined one of the hopefuls . " You got ta give us somethin ' . " <p> Javier laughed , his nerves still raw from the confrontation with Pointy-Toes . The crewman turned away from the hopefuls to glare at him . " What are you strutting about ? Yesterday you were trash , no different from them . Tomorrow you gon na be trash again , just like that . " He gestured at Pointy-Toes . " He wo n't make it one day . " <p> " Not me , " said Pointy-Toes . " I got connections . " <p> The crewman shrugged and pointed below deck . " All of you , down there . " <p> They waited for two hours in the airless cabin , sweating out of sight while the crew loaded the new guests and their luggage . They could hear music above , light tapping footsteps and women 's laughter . The two staff who 'd gone ashore came down and sat in a comer by themselves . Pointy-Toes started a crap game . <p> Javier watched the others lose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , he touched his shirt pocket , just to hear the reassuring crinkle of his job offer papers . Last night , before the gunfire woke him , he dreamed about a man behind a featureless gray desk , an Anglo with a mouth like a shark 's , starched green uniform over his paunch and a pistol at his hip . In his dream , the man pointed to Javier 's job papers and said , " These are no good . " <p> But his papers were good . Salvador , his father 's cousin , had gotten him the job interview even before the position opened up . The guy who 'd had the job , some friend of another cousin , had saved enough from his rich Angla patrona to buy a little farm down by Rio Sonora . <p> " You hear stories like that , " Salvador had said , " and you think you got it made . You think you 're in a goddamned candy store , you can have anything you want , and next thing you 're thinking is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you come cheap out there . There 's a hundred just as hungry who 'll give them whatever they want . You can make it good with this job or you can piss it all away . " <p> Javier had clenched his jaw to keep from talking back . Sal did n't mean to run him down like he had no sense . It was Sal who 'd taught him that whatever else a man might do , he took care of his family . <p> Then Sal grabbed him by the back of the neck and hugged him like a son . " You 're a good kid , I know that . " <p> Got ta watch it , Javier thought , remembering . That Pointy-Toes , he 's got a death wish or something . He sure ai n't worth getting into trouble for . Not when Igor Mama counting on me . <p> Javier took turns with the other men at the porthole as they pulled up at the guest pier . Tierra Flores , the Island was called , acres of lawns and tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shielded by groves of gardenia and dwarfed palm on the slopes from the central lodge to the sifted white sand . The buildings were white , as well as the filmy uv-canopies that covered the walkways and beaches . All of it was brought from the mainland , Santa Barbarita or Ventura , even the sand . <p> The pier had been hung with streamers and balloons . Green-uniformed staff greeted the guests with smiles and strings of flowers . The women swayed and tilted their heads , but the wind carried away the sound of their voices . <p> The staff landing was a fenced slab of cinderblock on the other side of the Island , well hidden from the guest areas . A handful of green-shirted men waited there . They surged forward as the boat tied up , pressing thin packets into the hands of one of the crew , the one who 'd locked the gate . It did n't look to Javier like a drug deal . Then what ? <p> Two security men in body armor frisked Javier and the others before escorting them inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short corridor and into a hot , bright-lit room . Here the new-hires stripped to their underwear . Their clothing went on a conveyor belt through the scanners . <p> The guards took the new-hires through the screening room one at a time . Sirens shrieked when Javier passed the metal alarm . He froze , startled , as a barbed-wire cage dropped clanging around him . The security guard pointed to the chain around his neck , strung through the bullet the docs had pried out of his spine . <p> " You gon na give me that thing , or you gon na turn around and go back home now ? " <p> Javier did n't want to hand it over , though he knew he had to . He felt naked without it , for it was the thing that should have killed him . <p> He undid the clasp and held it out through the bars . The guard flipped up his face mask to take a closer look . His skin was ashy-brown , his nose broad and flat . He whistled softly as he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up good . " He looked up . " They dig it out of you. ? " <p> Javier turned so the guard could see the scar running along his spine . <p> " Jee-sus , " the guard said . " Better you than me . " He tossed it back and raised the cage . <p> Javier 's fingers closed around the warm metal . The guard jerked his chin toward the far door . " Disinfection and Medical through there . " <p> Javier had n't seen a doc since he 'd left the E-ward after being shot . He did n't see one now . The physical exam  --  blood and semen samples , skin inspection , chest x-ray  --  was performed by a tech using automated instruments . The tech reminded Javier of a kid he 'd grown up with , but he never spoke or looked Javier in the eye . He pointed , pushed and jabbed with his needles , all without a word . <p> Javier spent that night underground with the other new-hires , the six of them on narrow cots in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soysteak in gravy , rubbery and bland . While the others settled down in bed , Javier tried the door . It was locked . <p> " I saw this in a movie once , " said Pointy-Toes . " Quarantine . " <p> " Whatever you got , " Javier muttered , " do n't give it to me . " <p> Javier lay for a long time in the darkened room , waiting for sleep . The paper sheets made unfamiliar sounds as the other men turned . Beyond that , nothing but silence . No gunfire , no creaking electric trams , no babies crying no night mercado with its mariachi band and women hawking backyard vegetables . <p> He could n't remember when he 'd felt this tired , but something in the stale , clammy air set his nerves on edge . He thought of those days in the hospital when he drifted in and out of consciousness and no one knew if he was going to live or die . He thought of the hot white glare on the water as the boat came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dank shadows of the dormitory . Then he thought of going home , of Mama 's face when he handed her his pay , more money than she 'd see in a year . He 'd buy her new shoes . She 'd have a decent place to live , one that was n't crawling with rats that would as soon take a bite out of you as run away , with water that did n't make you run bloody pus some days . And medicine for the baby , real stuff from a pharmacy , not street shit . <p> THE NEXT morning , Javier followed the other new-hires into the staff offices underneath the central lodge . The room was long and rectangular , a windowless cell . Two chairs , aluminum tubing and orange plastic , sat below a rattling overhead fan . Pointy-Toes and another new-hire took them , their satchels at their feet . Javier and the other men stood along the wall . <p> The name plate on the desk read , " S. Gibson , Personnel . " S. Gibson strode into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifties , tall and angular . She looked Latina , but her face had been artificially bleached so pale , as if she 'd never been a minute out in the sun , that Javier could n't be sure . Like the boat crew , she wore green , tailored and straight-skirted , not a wrinkle anywhere . She held a clipboard of papers in one hand . Her nails were long and curved , thick with layers of yellowed lacquer . <p> Her eyes on the papers and not the men , she slid behind her desk . " Congratulations and welcome to Tierra Flores , gentlemen . I see you 've all passed your physicals . I 'm Gibson , your supervisor . " Frowning , she picked up a pencil and rolled it between her fingers . " Which one of you is Javier Gonzalez ? " <p> Javier shifted from one foot to the other . " Yeah ? " <p> Without looking up , she jabbed the point of the pencil at the desk . " Let 's get one thing straight from the beginning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Yes , ma'am . ' Not ' lady ' or ' buzz ' or ' sugar ' or whatever the trash calls women these days . Understand ? " <p> Javier smiled , slow and easy , No problem , lady . <p> " Normally , we allow our staff a small amount of jewelry  --  wedding bands and the like . Nothing flashy or attention-getting . If you want to keep that bullet around your neck , wear it out of sight . " <p> She handed them each a map . " Staff quarters are marked . There 's an assignment roster on the compuscreen by the door  --  check to see which shifts you 're on today . You 'll have half an hour to collect your uniforms from Room Minus-21 . The minus means you go down to the sublevels . Any questions ? " <p> " Yea-ass , Miz Gibson , " said Pointy-Toes . " We get any time off ? " " You were told that at the time of the job offer . " She frowned again , knotting her black brows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check the schedule . " <p> Pointy-Toes sauntered to the desk , put both hands down and leaned forward . The edge of the desk caught him just below his crotch , accentuating the bulge as he thrust into it . His voice was lazy and hot , as if he was licking her . " And you . . . what do you do on your time off ? " <p> Javier felt the sudden rush of heat in the other men . Shit , man . Here comes trouble . One blush on that paper-white face and they 'd have her , as sure as if they 'd all ripped her clothes off . <p> " I fire people , " she said . " Starting with you . " <p> " Me ? You got ta be kidding . Come on , lady , I was just asking a question . " <p> She reached down and pressed a button on her desk . The door opened and a male staff member stood there . Six foot six , big shoulders , mean blue eyes . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pointy-Toes 's voice rasped on Javier 's nerves . " I got connections . " <p> Do n't beg . Oh man , do n't let the bitch make you beg . It 's only a job . . . It 's only back to moldy surplus even a cockroach would n't eat and dodging the cartel runners and watching another baby die of lung crud . <p> She lifted one eyebrow . " Harry , take the trash down to the dock and make sure he 's on the next boat . " <p> Pointy-Toes picked up his satchel and jerked his arm away from Harry 's big pink hands . " Someday , bitch , somebody 's gon na get you . " <p> " Someday . But it wo n't be you . " <p> The plastic name tag said " J. Gonzalez . " Javier was n't used to wearing starched shirts and the uniform felt strange , all stiff and smooth . He trained with a quiet Asian man , Namese , who kept his eyes down , movements neat and precise , jaw clenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he handled . But Javier paid attention to each fold of the satin sheets , the crystal bowl of flowers on its lacy doily in the exact center of the marble table , the arrangement of the pillows and towels . The Gibson bitch would notice these details . It was like filling out the welfare forms ; they 'd use any excuse to shove them back in your face . He would n't give Gibson an excuse . He 'd be the one in three who kept his job . If this ball-less squint could cut it , so could he . <p> They finished the last villa . Javier paused in the doorway and looked back at the main room with its pale peach upholstery and gauzy drapes . The room shimmered in its own pastel light . <p> Someday I 'll have a room like this . Someday Mama will have a room like this . <p> He stepped backwards on to the porch and nearly knocked down the woman who was standing there . She caught at him to keep her balance and her wide sleeves fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool and light . Underneath it , his fingers grazed the skin of her arms . She was the softest thing he 'd ever touched . Her perfume filled his head . He realized that she was an inch or so taller than he , and that her eyes were round and blue and rimmed with gold . <p> Shell-pink lips curved in a smile . " Excuse me . " She made the words into a kiss . Then she was gone , into the belly of the pale peach room , followed by three immaculate staff towing carts of luggage in creamy leather and a potted fruiting apricot tree on a rollered stand . <p> Javier ran a few steps to catch up with the Namese . " The guest ladies all like that ? " <p> The Namese shrugged and said nothing . <p> That evening there was beach cleanup , busing dishes and hanging paper lanterns on the veranda outside the main lodge . The lodge sat on a hill overlooking the sloping moon-bleached lawns . The staff entrance opened from the back , down below , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped out into the cooling night and glanced up at the veranda . The arpeggio of a harp rippled on the breeze and dancing couples drifted from the veranda like blown petals across the lawns . <p> She stood alone in the corner , the ivory-silk woman , her back to the music and curls spilling over her shoulders like spun glass . She turned and looked down to where he stood in the shadows , as if she could feel his eyes burning on her . He thought of her perfumed skin beneath his fingers . She swayed slightly , like the paper lanterns on the sea wind . <p> The next moment she was gone from the corner , moving with sweeping strides to the stairs . The breeze caught her long filmy skirts against her legs . He saw the outline of her thighs , the mound above them where the fabric bunched , and then she was running , slipping through the shadows and into his arms . For a moment , he could n't believe this was happening to him . The girl , the moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then her mouth , slippery with gloss , met his and he gave himself over to the heat of the moment . He forced her lips apart and thrust into her with his tongue . His heart pounded at the feel of her mouth all open to him . He ran his hands over the back of her dress , cupping her ass , fumbling for the opening . She twisted away and pulled his hand . <p> " Not here . " <p> She led him through the pools of darkness behind the massed azaleas and around the curve of the hill by the Japanese waterfall garden to the villa . The moonlight smelled of carnations and roses . <p> The gauzy dress fell in a heap on the carpet . Dios , she felt good . Rounded breasts with nipples hard and taut , fingertips tugging at his buttons . He pushed her back on the satin-covered bed and jerked loose his belt buckle . She watched him with gleaming eyes . <p> He had n't felt this wild , careening lust since the last time he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who died the next year with a needle in her arm . <p> He rode the hot bursting surge as it built and built until it hovered on the edge of pain . She cried out , something he could n't understand , and arched upward , head so far back all he saw was the triangular outline of her jaw . He pulled out fast , just in time to squirt over her thigh . <p> She grabbed his shoulder and yanked him over . Her nails dug into his skin . " What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Who told you to pull out ? " <p> She pulled him on top of her again , her mound thrusting against his limp cock . Soon he got hard again with her ramming him back into her . She moaned and wet her lips as he ground away , but it was no good . His lower back cramped and his sweat turned cold . After a few minutes , she tightened her legs around him and gestured for him to roll over , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never done it before . It was hot , really hot , the way she twisted and fingered herself and jerked and screamed when she came . <p> He woke up shivering with a patch of moonlight on his face , feeling like he 'd just washed up on a beach . The girl was asleep across his chest , her white hair spread out across his bare skin , one thigh across his groin . The weakness passed , leaving him cool and heady . <p> The girl stirred , perhaps roused by the change in his breathing . " Mm , that was all right . " <p> He smoothed her hair . " I got ta get back . I got work in the morning . " <p> She rolled on her side and began tracing circles around his nipple , dragging her nails across the skin and tugging the hairs that surrounded it in a sparse circle . " I thought you were supposed to keep the guests . . . happy . " <p> " You happy ? " <p> " Did they also tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out before dinner from two giggling cleaning girls . " Charity Bradford . Miss Charity Bradford . " <p> " I think . . . " she murmured as he began stroking her , already wet , " I think I 'll have you reassigned as my house boy . . . mm , oh yes , yes harder . . . take you away from here . . . oh , that 's good . . . to my own . . . private . . . . " <p> Just before dawn , Javier returned to the staff quarters where he shared a room with two other men . The hot shower made his skin itch , but he could n't see anything  --  no sign of body lice , no rash . He stared at his reflection in the mirror , surprised at the dusky color of his face . Even his eyes looked red . He supposed all-night fucking did that to you . <p> He tossed his green shirt into the laundry chute , put on his second one and pinned on his name tag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coffee , doughnuts and some kind of cardboard-colored mush had been set out in the staff area behind the kitchen . The smell of the food made his stomach chum . He took a sip of the coffee . Strong and bitter , it was the real stuff , but he could n't force it down . <p> He carried stacks of dishes and tableware to the tables . After only a few loads , he was sweating cold and his heart thumped so hard he could hardly hear anything else . The clatter of the dishes sounded tinny and far off . <p> " You okay ? " asked the head waiter , who was supervising the setting of the tables . <p> Javier shook his head . He set the tray of dishes down on the nearest table . His arms had turned to jelly . His vision whirled and his mouth tasted sour . He tried to say , " I do n't need nobody 's help , " when suddenly the room slid sideways and he saw someone who looked like himself , wearing a sweat-darkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke up lying on a paper-sheeted table . Cabinets lined the walls and sunlight filtered through a frosted glass window . He raised his head and focused on a sink , a wheeled stool and a goose-necked floor lamp . <p> A middle-aged man in a doc 's coat pushed the door open without knocking . He carried a slip of yellow lab paper in one hand . <p> " Javier Gonzalez ? " He spoke with a faint accent and sounded as if he were in a hurry . " Have you been feeling ill or tired lately ? " <p> " I been fine . " Javier sat up , holding his breath as the room spun and then slowly settled down . " You know how it is on a new job , you work extra hard . " <p> " Headaches ? Visual disturbances ? Itching , worse in a hot bath ? " <p> Javier remembered the crawling sensation as the steamy shower beat down on him . <p> " How long has your skin been red ? " <p> Javier started sweating . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yesterday ? " <p> " Well , maybe a week . But it 's just a long night and a sunburn , that 's all . " <p> The doc looked down at the lab slip again and suppressed a sigh . " No , I 'm very much afraid that is n't all . While you were unconscious , we reran your intake tests to confirm the diagnosis . Have you ever heard of polycythemia ? " <p> " Huh ? " <p> " I did n't think so . The word means too many red blood cells . The blood 's too thick and it forms clots that eventually kill the patient . It used to be that with treatment , the patient might live for years . Now we 've got this new syndrome , which seems to be triggered by something in the untreated mainland water . It is n't contagious , if that 's any concern to you . I wo n't insist on a medical discharge as long as you can work . " <p> " Whoo-ah ! " Javier held up his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something wrong with my blood. ? " <p> The doc nodded . <p> " And it 's gon na . . . gon na . . . " <p> " Kill you . Yes . It will kill you . As I said , what you will most likely die from is thrombosis , a blood clot lodging in your brain or heart . " <p> " There 's something you can do , is n't there ? A cure ? " The muscles of Javier 's belly tightened . <p> " We can remove blood . " The doc stared out the bank of windows that looked on to the eastern lawns . " It might buy you some time . Sometimes , once or twice in a thousand cases , there 's a spontaneous remission . The only treatment recognized as effective is gene-replacement , which is , " he paused , pursing his lips , " costly . " <p> " But it works  --  there 's something that works ? " <p> " Of course it works ! " the doc snapped , and for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State would let citizen-firsts die of something like this ? " <p> " But all those tests you did on me . . . " Javier said , still unbelieving . " How could they miss something like this ? " <p> The doc 's eyes glided past Javier . For a long moment he said nothing . In his silence , Javier understood that the tests had been only for the protection of the Island patrons . <p> " Come in back , we 'll get started with the phlebotomy , the bloodletting " the doc said . " Every other day until your hematocrit values come down . You 'll feel better for a week or two , maybe a month . But in your case , with the speed of onset . . . " He paused , his lips working then added in a tired voice . " I would n't expect much more . " <p> Javier lay on the table in the staff clinic room , clenching and unclenching his fist . He was alone . The Latino tech , the same one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Island , had set him up and left him . A coldness spread upwards from the needle in his arm . His blood ran through a clear tube into a bag out of his line of sight . He did n't know what would happen to it when they were done . <p> He 'd grown up knowing that any day he could be slashed up in a knife fight or shot by the cartel runners . He 'd imagined his life running out with his blood , flowing over the cracked pavement , turning the street into a lake of red . He saw Mama dipping her fingers into it , heard her sobbing , " Ay , Javier , no ! Not my son , my son . . . . " <p> After a time , the tech came back and removed the needle . As he pressed a patch bandage over the puncture site , his eyes flickered over Javier 's . <p> " The docs do n't know everythings " he said , his voice a rasping whisper . " All their fancy therapies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . There are other ways . The clinics in Ensenada . And I hear that sometimes the thing just bums itself out  --  " <p> Javier shook his head and stood up , cutting the man off . " Thanks , but I 'm gon na make it just fine . " <p> AFTER WORK there was Charity , waiting for him on the little porch outside her villa . She wore a kimono of patterned pink and gold , and her eyes were ringed with circles of the same colors . <p> Javier took her into his arms and pulled her into the rose-smelling cave . He slipped one hand inside her kimono and felt her nipples harden . There was a moist hot crescent under each breast , as if someone had licked her there . <p> " I 'm sorry I was such a bitch last night  --  about your pulling out and all , " she said , laughing softly . " You do n't need to , you know . I 've had the contraceptive shots . " She started unbuttoning his shirt . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , his voice husky . He was already hard and the way she tugged at his belt drove him crazy . His head felt as if it would burst and his heart pounded like mad . <p> This time they did n't even make it to the bed . He stayed inside her and she came again and again on the thick pale carpet . <p> At the end of the week , Javier felt so good he stopped going in for the blood drains . The doc must have made a mistake  --  what did he know , anyway ? Or maybe it was one of those miracle cures . <p> In the daytime , he worked beaches , meal cleanups and villas , stripping the vacated rooms before the cleaning girls came and then setting all the details after they 'd done . The Namese even loosened up enough to tell him he was doing a good job . <p> Charity went ashore for three days , without any warning . She 'd left all her belongings in the villa , even the apricot tree , so Javier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused whenever he got a clear view of the guest pier , stealing a few moments to watch for the boat . Finally he saw her get off and the knotted tension in his belly eased . <p> It was well after dark when he finished work and knocked at her door . In answer , she screamed at him in a language he did n't know , French or Russian maybe . Just as he turned away , the door swung open and she peeked out . The blackout drapes had been drawn tight , engulfing the room behind her in shadow . <p> She motioned for him to come in . For a moment he thought , To hell with her , I 'd rather sleep . And there was something about the room that did n't smell right . As he closed the door behind him and she toppled into his arms , he realized what it was . She reeked of opal-dust , nasty stuff that gave bizarre erotic visions when sprinkled over naked skin . It cost a bundle and could turn mean when mixed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and collapsed next to her on the rumpled satin . She curled her fingers around his shirt and twisted , pulling herself across his chest . He put his arms around her . <p> " Damned backlash , " she moaned . " Every time , I swear it 'll be the last . But you 're here now . " She sighed and abruptly fell asleep . <p> Javier lay with Charity 's weight across his ribs as his body got heavier and deader . The darkness did n't change when he closed his eyes . <p> He opened them some time later and sat up . The nightstand light was on , filling the room with a peach-rose glow . Charity lay beside him , propped up on one elbow . His shirt was gone . He thought it was still night , but could n't be sure . <p> Charity fingered the bullet as it swung from his neck on its chain . She stared at it as if she 'd never seen it before . " What 's this ? A souvenir ? " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out , he had to get out . <p> " From that scar on your back ? It 's all right to tell me , you know . " Her pale eyes looked opaque , like gravestone marble . He tried to get up , but she would n't let go of the bullet . <p> Suddenly she pushed him away and went to the dresser , dug in the piles of lace and silk for a pouch of gold-stitched brocade . It was long and thin , heavier than he expected when she jerked the drawstring loose and slid it out into his hand . <p> " That 's it , " she said , " the thing that almost killed me . " <p> Javier looked down at six inches of steel , hinged and folded like a knife . He touched the handles inlaid with mother-of-pearl and something smooth and creamy . <p> " Real ivory , " Charity said . " Can you imagine , some elephant died to make this thing ? " She took the knife and snapped it open . " Maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glinted off the squared blade . " It 's called a cut-throat razor , " she went on . " And it damned near cut mine , except I made a mess of it . The scars are gone now , the plastic surgeons saw to that . " <p> Slowly she ran her hand along the razor 's edge and watched the blood welling up in a narrow line . Javier had seen cuts like that  --  the sharper the knife , the longer they bled . She probably could n't even feel it yet . He caught the expression on her face , the mixture of horror and fascination as one dark drop after another fell on her sheer gown . He grabbed the razor from her and folded it closed . <p> Javier had helped the Namese restock the medicine cabinets with the usual toiletries and sanitary supplies  --  and packets of styptic powder for those gentlemen who still shaved with blades . He brought out several , along with bandages . Charity held out her hand like a child as he sprinkled it over the cut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with disinfectant and bandaged it . " You should n't be playing with this . " He held up the folded razor . " You could really hurt yourself . " <p> " That was the idea , was n't it ? " Then she gulped and looked away . " You know , I think you 're right . I do n't really . . . I ca n't trust myself with it . " She shivered . " You keep it for me . " <p> " Me ? " <p> " And I 'll keep this . " She curled her fingers around the bullet and tugged . The chain bit into his skin . <p> Javier 's muscles hardened in denial . The razor , even if the ivory was n't real , was worth a bundle , and the bullet . . . . <p> She slipped the chain over his neck . " I need something to remind me that I 'm not alone . That I have someone I can count on . " Her eyes searched his . " We all need that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack deeper day by day , despite Javier 's efforts to ignore it . It was lack of sleep , he told himself . Awake half the night with Charity and then up before dawn , working the beach cleanup crew , that was all . <p> Every morning he raked the powdery sand , scrubbed the chairs and tables with rust suppressant , swept the walkways . To be outdoors and yet protected was still new enough to bring its own pleasures . Once he found a gold dangle earring beneath one of the lounge cushions . The crew head told him to take it to Gibson 's office . <p> She weighed the glittering trinket in her hand before placing it in the lockbox in her desk . Javier stood , fists at his sides , watching . What did she think , he 'd tried to steal it ? <p> " You 've passed your probation . " Gibson held out an envelope . " There 's your pay . You 're also entitled to one free passage to the mainland each month , but you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together so I can shift schedules . " <p> Javier imagined himself on the boat , approaching the pier . The dusty beachfront hotels blending with the burnt-grass hills . And Mama 's face when he gave her the money . His memory wavered , blurring her image . Something held him , some invisible tie , as if the bullet chain still hung around his neck . He told himself this was a bad time to leave Charity , just when she needed him . He was a man who took care of his women . <p> " Next time , maybe . Keep it on my account . " <p> " You can have it sent to the mainland , you know . Wired direct to a checking account or  --  " her voice softened imperceptibly , "  --  there are ways of sending cash . " <p> " How much ? " <p> " Ten percent off the top , but it 'll get there . The captain 's honest . " <p> Javier nodded and gave Mama 's address . Gibson put the pay packet away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The doc says you 've missed your last three clinic appointments . " <p> What do you care what happens to me ? Javier stared at her , his muscles tightening . The only reason she had n't chucked him like Pointy-Toes was that he could n't give anything contagious to her precious guests . " I can take care of myself . " <p> " Can you ? You 're all so young , so arrogant . " She paused , her lips narrowing and her eyes going blank as if she were no longer talking to him . " You think getting out of the barrio is the hard part . You think that once you 're out , nothing worse can ever happen to you . " <p> His next free half-day , Javier want back to the staff clinic and mentioned how tired he was . " We can take more blood , for all the good it 'll do , " the doc said . " Or you could try one of the free clinics on the mainland . But if it were me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It 's not the end , Javier thought . I still got time . I still got Charity . <p> She 'd just stepped out of a shower and wrapped herself in a pale-peach towel , with another around her head . She wore his bullet around her neck , next to her skin . She saw him outside the sliding door and sat at the vanity table with her back to him , watching him in the mirror . <p> He crossed the carpet to stand behind her . Dizziness touched him with icy fingers . The room slipped , steadied . <p> " Something 's wrong , " she said , twisting around on the stool to face him . <p> " I just seen the doc  --  " <p> " Shit ! " She leapt to her feet . " What kind of crud did you give me ? You 're supposed to be screened ! " <p> " No ! It 's not catching . The doc , he says  --  " <p> " What is it , then ? " <p> " Something called poly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips , she crossed to the bed . " Where will they send you , the Camarillo Hospice ? " <p> He sat beside her and felt her thighs naked beneath the towels . She looked up at him as he cupped her/ace and kissed her . Caressed her lips , stroked her mouth with his tongue until he heard her breath quicken . The towel loosened and fell away . <p> " It 's so good what we have together , " he murmured . " I love you , Charity . " <p> " Love me . Yes . " <p> " And I would keep on loving you . . . if only . . . " <p> " The genetic treatment , you mean . " <p> " The doc says it works . . . " He started down the side of her neck , little kisses that sent her shivering , " but it costs . . . " <p> He worked his way past her breasts , down across her belly as she lay back and spread her legs wide for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 'd be with you . . . whenever you want me . . . doing this . . . and this . . . . " <p> " Oh yes . Oh yes , yes . . . . " <p> When Javier left her , she did n't even open her eyes . He drew the sheets over her naked body . Tiredness dragged at him , but he hardly felt it . He 'd done it , fucked her brains out . To hell with the doc  --  to hell with all of them . He and Charity would blow the Island and he 'd be set . <p> A survivor , that 's what he was . Out of the barrio and on to the beach . <p> Hauling himself out of bed before dawn the next morning was hell , as if he weighed a million pounds . He felt better after he 'd eaten and finished the breakfast shift . Villa clean-up was busy that morning . A bunch of guests had checked out , more were arriving in the afternoon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Charity 's . <p> Javier stood in the doorway and stared at the silent room . He took a step inside , It still smelled of her perfume . He could see where she 'd lain on the rumpled sheets , how she 'd pushed them aside getting up . The towels in the bathroom were damp , the potted apricot tree gone . <p> The Namese pushed past him and began ripping the sheets off the bed , bundling them for the cleaning girls . He emptied the flower bowls , tossing the still-lush blossoms in the trash . <p> In the top drawer of the dresser , Javier found an envelope , thick creamy paper , addressed to him . Inside was a month 's wages and a note which read , " Keep the razor . You 'll need it . " <p> Cold seeped up Javier 's legs from the pale-peach carpet . He dashed down the path to the little vista of the beach . The boat had already pulled away from the pier . <p> Something inside of Javier screamed , Bitch ! His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'll get you for this , bitch ! <p> Then he was running , the sea wind Whistling in his ears , down past the kitchen and the snowball azaleas , down to the beach . He sped past the bathers , sheltered beneath the billowing uv-canopies . None of the guests looked up . The boat 's triangular wake made a shadow against the glare of the waves . <p> Javier 's chest burned with each breath . His vision turned blurry and gray . Without conscious thought , his hands clenched into fists . He thought of Charity 's face and how he wanted to smash it . He saw blood bursting from those soft full lips , saw them split apart like overripe fruit , felt her teeth splinter , saw her blue eyes widen and bulge . <p> Pain in his hand brought Javier back to his body . He was clutching the folded razor so tightly his muscles had cramped . <p> Waves lapped at his ankles . He snapped the razor open and traced a line in his skin . Like a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The line looked white for an instant before it welled up with bright blood . His heartbeat slowed . He cut again , deeper this time , and watched the blood seep out . There was no pain . <p> Javier shook his hand and a drop of blood fell into the foamy green water . For a moment , he saw the ocean turn the color of blood , saw dark red waves sweep across the beach and drench the sand , all that fine rich white sand . <p> He pictured himself standing on the boat , looking back at the beach , pictured the guests ' faces . Heard their cries as they tried to scrub the stains from their feet . <p> It would be so easy to keep on , slashing deeper and deeper into his flesh , filling the ocean with his blood . But that was Charity 's way out , the one she 'd chosen for him . Only there would be no fancy doctors to stitch him back together . <p> If I 'm gon na die , it 's not gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A throb of pain brought him back to the present , from a trickle of sweat running into the cut . The blood was already beginning to clot . He had , without thinking , folded the razor closed . <p> Javier put it in his pocket and walked slowly up the trail to the main lodge . He met the Namese with the cart of cleaning supplies and they stood there for a moment . The Namese said in his soft , whispering voice , " What you do now ? " <p> " Go home , " said Javier . Die . <p> " Family . Is best  --  family . " The Namese reached into his shirt pocket and took out an old-style laminated photograph . Javier made out a row of solemn-looking old people crammed together on a sofa , a few adults standing or crouching beside them , and children on everyone 's laps . He wondered if the Namese 's pay supported them all . <p> Javier continued up the path . As if for the first time , he noticed the gleaming paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pristine gravel of the path . There was not a scrap of litter , not a faded leaf , not a pebble out of place . He thought of all the people whose work it was to keep things that way . <p> S. Gibson looked up from a stack of papers as he knocked on the opened door and entered her office . Before , the room had seemed a windowless cell . Now he was struck by how impersonal it was , and how hare . She had no pictures anywhere , not on the walls , not on her desk . No flowers , either . Just racks and piles of papers , a cup of pens and one of paper clips . The upholstery of her chair had been worn through around the edges , the only sign a real person ever sat there . <p> " I 'm going home , " he said . <p> For a moment she said nothing , just stared at him . He noticed the tightness in her mouth , the shadows around her eyes that even her heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keys and unlocked her desk drawer . " You have some additional pay coming , " she said . And , he reminded himself , there was the extra money from Charity . Maybe he could find some mainland doc  --  <p> No , he thought . The money was for Mama , for his sister Ans and the baby , if he was still alive . Javier was a man who took care of his family . <p> " The boat will take you over this afternoon , " Gibson said , each word bitten off . <p> " Thank you . " He paused , for a moment not sure if he should ask , half-expecting her to accuse him of theft . But what more did he have to lose now ? His job , his life ? He held out the razor . " You know someplace I could get money for this ? " <p> She picked it up , ran her fingertips over the handle . " It 's antique , worth something with this ivory . Try Rosten 's on Wilshire , West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of our people sell things there , no questions asked . They wo n't give you top dollar , but they wo n't cheat you blind , either . " She wrote the name down on a piece of paper and slid it with the razor across the desk to him . " A family could live for a year in the barrio on that . But it wo n't buy you the genetic therapy . " Something in her voice said , No amount of money can . <p> As Javier 's fingers closed around the razor , his mouth curved into a smile . " I got everything I need . " <p> THE CAPTAIN let Javier watch from the deck as the boat pulled away from the Tierra Flores dock and then , almost apologetically , said he must go below . He was the only member returning that trip and he had the porthole all to himself . He braced himself against the movement of the boat and watched the waves spatter against the salt-pitted glass . <p> After a while , Javier sat down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going anywhere , just swaying like a cheap carnival ride while the ocean rose up around him , vast and deep and colder than he 'd imagined possible . <p> Javier must have dozed off , for the next thing he knew , the heaving motion of the boat had stopped . He picked up the plastic bag with the few things he 'd brought with him and touched the pocket where the razor rested . It was still there , along with the envelope tucked under his belt . <p> Outside , seagulls dove in circles , crying out to one another . The sun hurt Javier 's eyes as he clambered on to the dock . He 'd forgotten how bright it was out here , with the unscreened light reflecting off the concrete . Across the landing past the guest gazebo with its uv-canopy and trailing roses , men with dark , anxious faces pressed up against the wire fence . Their fingers hooked through the chain links . They drew back as one of the boat crew unlocked the gate . As Javier pushed his way past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him pause . <p> " Anything for the Lopez family ? " <p> " Sorry . " <p> At the edge of the crumbling pavement , Javier took a deep breath , smelled bird shit and rust . One of the hopefuls trudged toward him , a sunwithered man with gray in his hair and a knife scar across one cheek . <p> " No luck this time ? " Javier asked . <p> " There 's too many , like always . Some been waiting since last night . You know how it is , you go out every day and it 's always the same . But you got to do it anyway . What about you , man ? You get kicked out or something ? " <p> Laughter bubbled up in Javier 's chest and sent him coughing . He reeled and put out one hand to steady himself on one of the sun-screen posts . His hand met something solid , but he felt nothing . The world went gray and cold . He could n't catch his breath properly . <p> No , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Something warm and solid caught him , buoyed him up . His vision steadied . The hopeful ducked his head as he swung one of Javier 's arms over his own shoulders . Javier pulled back , although he felt almost too dizzy to stand . A man without a job might steal for what was in another man 's pockets , or might kill for it . But the black eyes which met his were clear and honest , the voice resonant with a familiar cadence . " Just get me to the tram stop , " Javier said . " I can make it on my own from there . " <p> As he rode along at the back of the tram car , Javier 's right arm went numb , as if it no longer belonged to him . Richly textured patterns flowed past his eyes , the coils of rested barbed wire that marked the East City boundary , graffiti , tattoo blue and resset against the softness of stucco turning to powder , the peppering of bullet holes on walls . Javier was struck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wondered if he were really dying or if it was only that the Island had in some treacherous way left its mark on him . <p> For a long moment after he got off the tram , Javier stood on the sidewalk and stared , as if he 'd suddenly found himself in the middle of a strange neighborhood with no idea how he 'd gotten there . None of the shops with their baskets of backyard-grown avocados , lemons , and fresh chiles looked familiar . On the other side of the street , shaded by the shop awnings , old men sat in a row , drinking from bottles in plastic bags . As a trio of boys darted from the nearby alley , one of the men called out to one of them , " Hola , Chico ! Your Mama 's been looking for you . " <p> A few feet from Javier , two women in long-sleeved dresses and straw hats chattered in Spanish , bargaining for vegetables and packets of lard . One held a toddler by the hand , its face shiny with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip . Suddenly the baby convulsed , coughing and gasping . The sound of the air wheezing through its tiny lungs sent a shiver of fear through Javier . He thought of Ana 's baby , of her joy at his birth and the awful hurting craziness that ate into her day by day as she watched her child grow weaker . <p> You got ta make it , baby . You got ta make it for both of us . <p> The baby might very well die , of course , just like Javier on any day of his life . Even if he survived the lung crud , he could be caught by a bullet or end up running with the dopers . But for today , all he needed was a chance . Not even an edge , just a chance . <p> The closer Javier got to the apartment on Temple Street , the more flashes of familiarity came to him , as if these shambling buildings with their patches of weeds and abandoned automobiles occupied a more tenacious hold on his memory . Even the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the comer , face patterned with stripes of blue and white zinc oxide and Uzi pistol in plain sight . He squinted at Javier and suddenly Javier 's ears rang with the memory of gunfire and his body jerking and spinning and slamming to the pavement . Mama had found him before the ambulancers came and even now he heard her broken whispers . <p> Ay , Javier . . . my son . . . <p> But this time Javier was not lying in the street in a pool of his own blood , he was limping down it . He felt stiff , fragile , trapped in an old man 's body . But somewhere in the back of his mind , Mama still wept for him . There was nothing he could buy for her that would take that memory away . What did she want with a pale peach room or a pair of fancy shoes ? She wanted him , him and never the money . She had been right to fear for him when he left for the Island . <p> Thinking this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's stubbornness flowed into him . She would fight for him and hold on to him , right up to the very last breath . She would never let go , never . She would struggle , she would pray , she would ply him with her own chile diablo , that she swore would frighten away demons , until he had a gut on him the size of a watermelon . She would go clear to Ensenada for snake oil and folk remedies  --  <p> Ensenada . <p> In a flash , Javier remembered what the medical tech had said , how he 'd waited until they were alone , as if passing a secret . There are other ways , he 'd said . At the time , Javier had been so fired-up , he had n't wanted to listen . But what if the tech were right , what if the thing sometimes burned itself out or there were some other treatment ? <p> Would the Island clinic doc have told him ? Would the doc have even known about anything else ? All the guests were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Javier halted at the bottom of the outdoor stairs , breathing hard . He had to get up them . He had to find a way . He was too close to give up now . In the end , he left the plastic bag on the ground and used his good hand to haul himself up by the rested metal railing , sucking in his breath with every step . <p> The apartment door swung open before Javier reached it . Music blared away inside . Ana stood there , mouth opened in surprise , but for that first instant , he did n't see her against the shadowed room . He saw only the laughing rosy-cheeked baby in her arms . A bubble of milk rested in the comer of his mouth . His eyes were so clear that looking into them was like looking up at a starless night . <p> For a moment , Javier dared not breathe . He climbed the final step and reached out with his good hand to see if the baby were real or only something he 'd wished for so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his fingers . His skin against Javier 's was moist and surprisingly soft . <p> Ana turned her head and shouted , " Mama ! " The next instant , Mama appeared beside her , eyes glittering , mouth straight . She started chattering away in Spanish , the sound of her voice drowned in the noise of the radio and a dog which had started barking in the street below . When she stepped forward and took Javier into her arms , she smelled of soap and spices and herself , smells he remembered from his childhood . <p> Javier looked down at his hand . He could still feel the imprint of the baby 's touch , as if it were flesh of his own flesh , bone of his own bone , blood of his own blood . It was the strongest thing he 'd ever felt , that lingering touch . Stronger than all the things that had almost killed him  --  the smashed-up bullet , the red fury on the beach . <p> It would stay with him for the rest of his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother 's shoulder . Weariness dropped from him . Everything seemed to come clear at last . " Mama , " he whispered , " I 'm home . " <p> <p> By Deborah Wheeler <p> Deborah Wheeler lives in Southern California .
