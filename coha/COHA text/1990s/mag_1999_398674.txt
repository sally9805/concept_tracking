Women 's magazines continue to create  --  and exploit  --  women 's anxiety <p> THE TEST MONITORS HAD WARNED that removing anything from the Advanced Placement English Exam book was strictly off-limits . But when I read the opening paragraph of Joan Didion 's essay On Self Respect , I knew I had to smuggle it home . I was not the type to risk the opprobrium of my superiors ( and I would have been mortified if I had been caught carefully ripping my test booklet apart ) , but I suppose that 's why I found Didion 's wry wisdom so compelling . At the awkward age of 17 , I had bought the line that good manners , high SAT scores , and a small dress size would assure a lifetime 's worth of happiness . Didion , however , delivered a very different message . Those accomplishments might earn praise from other people , she allowed , but impressing parents , teachers , boyfriends , et al . would never secure approval from the most important audience of all : yourself . Pin your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one day you will face yourself " with the apprehension of someone who has come across a vampire and has no crucifix at hand . " <p> Overshadowing that insight is a curious irony : On Self Respect first appeared in the pages of Vogue . While Didion 's essay explained that a sense of self-worth had nothing to do with the perceptions of others , the magazine insinuated that external image was everything . For the young women who picked up that 1961 edition of the glossy , it was a particularly potent message . Back then , women were shut out of all but a handful of professional careers , and their economic security hinged on the fortunes of the men they married . Attracting Mr. Right and keeping him happy was of paramount importance , and Vogue and sister publications like Glamour and Mademoiselle implicitly promised the battle plan to landing the gold ring . Cosmetics and clothes comprised the bulk of the weaponry , and it 's hard to think of more fertile ground for ads hawking " indispensable " products like eyeliner and pantyhose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't just sell ad space to cosmetics companies and clothing retailers  --  they actively plugged their advertisers ' products in their articles , too . The proverbial wall between ads and editorial was never very high in these magazines , if it was ever erected to begin with . <p> Now , a logical legacy of the women 's rights movement should have been the demise of these publications . Once women were free to navigate the shoals of corporate America or trailblaze in genetic research , their futures no longer depended on being attractive to the opposite sex . And as women 's magazines had essentially made " how to land a man " their organizing principle , you would think emancipated females would have junked those glossies along with their Hoovers and Betty Crocker aprons . But the market did n't exactly dry up : An estimated 40 million women read these magazines each month . And while the women 's movement preached autonomy and independence , that message did n't prompt women 's magazine editors to rethink their promiscuous relationship with their advertisers ; these publications still enthusiastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those plugs are just an added bonus to an already lucrative forum for advertisers . While these slicks profess to help women " be all they can be , " their photographs of anorexic models , innumerable diets , and fashion tips all raise the bar of what a woman " should " be to ridiculous ( and unhealthy ) heights . What better place than in their pages to peddle products that promise to close the gap between what women are and this unattainable ideal ? Stepford 's little helper <p> " You ask  --  what am I really like ? " reads a Glamour spread from October 1960 . " We answer  --  we know you . You 're spirited and witty , trying pretty valiantly to practice what we preach : that regardless of age or circumstance , it 's your obligation as a woman to look attractive . " The message was n't always laid out that explicitly , but it 's certainly the subtext on every page of these magazines . How women 's publications honed that pitch depended on their target audience . Redbook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Mademoiselle and Glamour aimed for college girls and middle class " young marrieds . " Harper 's Bazaar and Vogue 's niche was the moneyed couture set . So while photo layouts of leggy lookers was the norm in all these magazines , Glamour would paste a heading proclaiming " He says he 'll eat soup for a year , if I 'll just buy something great " across the top of one layout ; you 'd never find that phrasing in the snootier Vogue . <p> Still , the bottom line in all of these publications was the same : Women 's raison d'etre revolved around sporting wedding bands . To a ' 90s reader , poring over these magazines gives a whole new appreciation for Adrienne Rich 's line from the 1963 poem Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law : A thinking woman sleeps with monsters ? ' Thinking , apparently , was n't part of the plan . " Man is a romantic and needs illusion , " cautions a 1949 Glamour article . " Part of this illusion ( which should be reality ) is that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either in ... intelligence or in her competence  --  this illusion withers . " Aside from coyly dumbing themselves down , women would also do well to meticulously monitor their appearance , Glamour advised in its 1960 's feature " Fifty Ways to Charm a Man " Men " come out four square against stocking seams crooked , slips showing , heels run down , nail polish chipped , and lipstick where it does n't belong , " reported the editors . And forget about asking hubby to help out around the house or take care of junior . " Babies prefer their mothers to take care of them rather than their fathers , " a 1961 Redbook article dubiously reported . Women , furthermore , had better continue the after-work cocktail hour with their husbands , lest the new dad begin to feel neglected . And under no circumstances should the man of the family come home to a " half-baked dinner " ! <p> The ads in these magazines provide a further sociological record of the ' 50s middle-class housewife existence . Next to articles about childbirth are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How to bake the perfect pie " and " How to bake perfect cookies " are pages commending Minute Tapioca . It 's obvious the vast majority of readers did n't lay claim to their own income . An omnipresent headline on advertisements is " Do you need money ? " followed by a pitch for **26;1185;TOOLONG classes or the opportunity to hawk Christmas cards . <p> The ads not only provide a window on real-life Mrs. Cleavers , they also show the breathtaking lengths to which magazine editors sold out to their advertisers . Glamour , for example , featured a regular column authored by the apocryphal " Marjorie , " whose description of her shopping exploits were framed by ads peddling the products the 20-something heroine picked up . " I stumbled across the dearest pair of black leather pumps , with a one-inch Louis heel ( the heel is one inch , I do n't know about Louis ) , " reads the September 1960 column . Juxtaposed is a half-page ad for the shoes . <p> Glamour eventually pulled the Marjorie column . And women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ females no longer spend all their days shopping or popping Valium in the suburbs , and mags have correspondingly altered their tone . Most slicks run stories on office life ( generally of the " How to Ask For a Raise " or " How to Scale the Corporate Ladder " variety ) . Publications like Glamour and Marie Claire also boast the occasional piece on HMOs or sexual harassment . <p> For the most part , however , women 's magazines are pushing the same message they were half a century ago : Women 's existence revolves around landing the right guy . Except these days , the seduction is n't accomplished through baking the perfect cake , sculpting your nails , or making sure your hemline is n't crooked . The World 's Oldest Profession <p> " Kama Sutra 2:12 Naughty New Sex Positions , Including Our Personal Favorite  --  The Dragon ' " screams one of Cosmopolitan 's September 1999 headlines . " His 126 Secret Sex Thoughts : The Dastardly Details Racing Through His Mind  --  Right Now ! " promises Glamou 's August issue . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genre when it dubbed its August edition the " Sex-obsessed issue . " <p> If there is a dividing line between the women 's magazines of a few decades back and the covers we eye on the check-out line today , it 's the sex obsession . In 1961 Redbook ran an article cautioning young women that premarital hanky-panky could mean giving up any chance of walking down the aisle ; today the magazine advises readers on how to drive men wild . In a sense , it 's a healthy corrective for publications to acknowledge women have hormones , too . But if readers took this stuff seriously , they would spend their nights and the better part of their days staring at ceiling tiles . And while these articles are packaged under the " liberated woman " motif , they 're really just another variation on the " snagging and keeping a guy " theme . Consider the headlines : Cosmo promises to reveal " The Bedroom Trick That Will Blow Him Away " ; Redbook offers " Steamy moves that will make him beg for you  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geisha training . " Those headlines generate a response , " says Steven Cohen , editor in chief of the Media Industry newsletter . " That 's why Cosmo sells two million copies every month off of the newsstand " <p> The other surefire marketing ploy is the celebrity cover . Glance at a magazine rack and you 'll quickly realize that sycophantic celebrity profiles are all the rage in publications ranging from Rolling Stone to Newsweek . But women 's magazines take the trend a step further . They not only print gushing articles about models and actors ; they also literally posit these people as moral exemplars . TV actress Jane Leeves , for example , authored Marie Claire 's July advice column . " She won Niles ' heart on Fraiser ' without even trying , " reads the introductory note . Of course , it was Leeves ' fictional television persona who entranced her equally fictional co-star . No matter  --  her character 's bonafides qualify her to give advice about breast reduction , married men , and sibling rivalry . Not to be outdone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Like the Stars Do ) : How to save face with Hollywood grace after mortifying mishaps " Readers were advised to take a page from Latina star Jennifer Lopez , who wrote letters of apology to fellow celebrities she had disparaged in an interview . Actress Minnie Driver , meanwhile , was commended on weathering her breakup from actor Matt Damon with aplomb . " The easiest way to get a broken heart off your  --  and everyone else 's  --  mind is to slide right back into circulation , just as Driver did , " says Cosmo . " She appeared a few weeks later on Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins ' arm ( well , actually , she was on his lap ) . " <p> It 's difficult to see just what readers can gain by emulating the stars ' bed-hopping existence . But as publicity can make or break a movie career , it 's pretty obvious what stars reap from the breathless coverage . Magazines , meanwhile , can expect a jump in sales when they feature a celebrity on their covers . An excerpt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratching that goes on between magazines and actors . " It 's nice to see Minnie on your cover and even nicer to read a story about her when she 's not pimping some movie , " wrote one reader . The sheepish reply : " Thanks , but um , Minnie was promoting An Ideal Husband . So rush out right now and see it " <p> Women 's magazines do n't just cozy up to celebrities  --  they are still unapologetic promoters of their advertisers ' products . Examples of this unsavory relationship are as numerous as Brooks Brothers shirts in a Wall Street law firm . Glamou 's " You , you , you beauty " section vouched for Lancome moisturizer ; Calvin Klein purse spray ; and Neutrogena hand cream , mascara , and face powder in its August issue , where all three companies placed multipage ads . Jane showers paeans on Doc Martens boots in its fashion section , just after an ad for the shoeware . Ralph Lauren bought eight pages of publicity in Cosmo , and the magazine trumpeted the fashion line 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bath Fizzies . <p> If you do n't read through these magazines carefully ( believe me , not the best use of your time ) it 's easy to miss the muddy division between articles and advertising . What also becomes apparent is how mags tailor themselves to a certain age bracket . That 's savvy marketing ; advertisers prefer to hawk their products to defined audiences . If you want to figure out the median age of a women magazine 's readership , check out the ubiquitous Mentor breast augmentation ad . In New Woman ( whose average reader is 37 , according to Mediamark Research Inc. ) a 38-year-old mother of two explains in a Mentor spread that her implants made her feel like she 'd finally " done something just for me . " In the younger-oriented Marie Claire , a 31-year-old sales representative swears she feels " better than ever " since going under the knife . For women who long to be voluptuous but ca n't scrape together the cash for surgery , Cosmo offers another option : Readers can " get more cleavage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duct tape . What 's the Allure ? <p> Why do women lap this stuff up ? Well , ladies ' economic fortunes may no longer turn on landing the right guy , but both men and women want to be perceived as attractive . The slicks speak to that desire ( men are n't immune to this pitch , either ; for a description of the rise of men 's magazines , see " Turning Boys Into Girls " in our May 1998 issue . ) With headlines like " Flat Abs Fast : The Five Minute Workout " and " Instant Tone-Up Tricks , " these magazines promise quick physical results with minimum effort . And once readers are toned and primped , these publications roll out strategies to bring suitors down on their knees . " How to make a man yours forever " guarantees Cosmopolitan 's September issue . " ( Or for as long as you want him ) ? <p> The tag line is revealing . Cosmo and the rest may promise moves to entice members of the opposite sex the way a beam of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these glossies to prepare people for the day when the early frisson wears off . Being proficient in Cosmo 's dragon position wo n't help when you 're trying to negotiate the bumps that eventually spring up in any relationship . Nor will " bigger cleavage " via Mentor breast implants or the cheaper duct tape solution . In the glib world of these slicks , there is n't a place for the hard work of compromise . More importantly , there is n't an acknowledgment that a solid sense of self-worth is a prerequisite to being in a successful relationship  --  or , for that matter , leading a healthy life . <p> Now , to hear the editors of these magazines tell it , their mission is precisely to help readers feel feminine and good about themselves . But these publications are n't really geared to nudging up readers ' self-esteem . Rather , they are peddling an unattainable package and needling their readership on how far short of the goal they fall . It 's not just page after page of waifish models that gnaw at women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they skillfully mimic that insistent , self-critical voice that plague so many young adults . " Are you fit ? " asks New Woman in its July issue . " Are you sure ? " Or check out Glamour . " The first impression you made on someone critical was as bland as oatmeal , " reads a heading in its August issue . " Can you bounce back ? " Perhaps the best example is an article that appears a few pages later , " Is Envy Eating You Up ? " It reads like a camp version of an Iago soliloquy . " You may as well stop reading right here if you have never felt your stomach knot , your heart sink and your brain scream I 'm such a loser ' ... Still with us ? Thought so . " <p> And what can a reader do to boost her sense of self-worth ? Well , if she is plagued by " relationship envy , " Glamour recommends the following exercise : " Draw a line and write Total Failure ' on one end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to you ( I found a soulmate , ' or maybe , I had one night of hot sex ' ) . Decide where you are on that line , and be very specific about how you would have to conduct yourself tomorrow to get one step closer to your goal . " <p> Obviously , trolling for " one night of hot sex " is n't going to increase women 's self-confidence . Nor will the Louis heel pumps " Marjorie " swore by . No , as Joan Didion told Vogue readers , those sort of quick fixes have nothing to do with self-respect . Rather , a sense of confidence springs from self-awareness and discipline . It 's about understanding your limitations and making the effort to rise above them . People with self-respect are n't complacent , but neither are they hyper-critical . They coax the best out of themselves . <p> Didion made no extravagant promises for the protective power of self-respect . It will not keep you " out of strange beds , ambivalent conversations , and trouble in general , " she warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mistakes is really the only way to live . Didion 's message is n't necessarily soothing , but she 's laying out hard truths all of us encounter sooner or later . In our unaccomodating world , all of us eventually encounter Didion 's vampires . And , despite the assurances of Vogue and like-minded publications , during those painful confrontations frosted pink lipstick , a winning smile , and all of the clothes in the world are n't the kind of amulets you 'll need to have at hand . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Glamour <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Cosmopolitan <p> By Alexandra Starr <p>
