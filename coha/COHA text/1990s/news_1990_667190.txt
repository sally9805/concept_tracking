<p> James " Buster " Douglas was born a fighter , though he never wanted to be one . Fate won . <p> He cared little for the hard work , grime and sweat - even less for the slime he met . <p> Yet boxing attached itself to the strapping , fun-loving Douglas like a parasite . Ultimately , he realized he could n't destroy destiny . <p> Tonight , in a fight billed as " The Moment of Truth , " the often-maligned heavyweight champion confronts the unbeaten Evander Holyfield at The Mirage resort here . <p> He also must face a doubting public , and the haunting specter of his own indifference and instant wealth - $ 20 million for this fight alone . <p> A worldwide pay-per-view TV audience ( 10 : 35 p.m . EDT ) waits for an answer : Is Buster a one-time wonder ? <p> " I was sitting in the ring this week and I had quite an anxiety attack , " says Douglas , who just eight months ago overcame adversity and turned the boxing world upside down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not even the death of his mother 23 days before the Tyson fight could prevent fate from scoring a knockout . <p> " See , I was born to be a fighter . Never even knew ' cause instantly I could box , " says the Columbus , Ohio , fighter . " Say you 're a writer , but sometimes you do n't want to write . You want to direct . I wanted to be a football player , then I wanted to be a basketball player . <p> " I never wanted to be a boxer . I went to school and faded fast . So I went back to boxing . And here I am . Destiny . " <p> For the first time since the Tyson fight , he will stand on that stretched patch of leather known as the " four corners of truth . " This time , there will be no sneaking up and ambushing his foe . He is in his element , the ring , but it is also the world stage and , as all fighters know , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighter he says he is ? A temporarily out- of-the-closet underachiever disguised in champion 's robes ? Or merely another in boxing 's littered trail of paper champions satisfied with Andy Warhol- style fame and a huge chunk of coin . <p> Some days , even Douglas does n't know . " Sometimes , I doubt my own ability . I doubt myself , " he says . <p> An off-the-board underdog in Tokyo last February , Douglas slayed The Beast They Call Tyson , but the public is skeptical . <p> He is the underdog again . He is ridiculed again . " Buster Bashing " is in vogue . The fat jokes flowed freely this week . Douglas passed his gut-check against Tyson when he climbed off the deck , but he has trouble passing the refrigerator to keep his girth in check . <p> Douglas denies he tipped the scales at 270 - he fought Tyson at 231 1/2 - but he had to push himself to shed excess flab . While in the Mirage hotel sauna this week to melt off extra pounds , Douglas actually ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he admits , " I tend to go to my grandma 's house , sit on the back porch and eat Southern food . Pinto beans and neckbones . Good stuff . " <p> His grandmother , Sarah Jones , is the woman who helped raise Douglas . She remembers the first time he came in crying from a fight . He was 6 . He had a bloody nose and black eye . The story goes that she hoisted him in front of a mirror and told him , " If you ever come in again like this , your rear end is going to look like your face . " <p> To this day , he hears the " what's-wrong-with-you " refrain : from promoters , his peers , the media . <p> Last week , Tyson , who groggily groped the canvas in Tokyo searching for his mouthpiece , called the champion a " mutt . " Promoter Don King embarrassed Douglas in court last summer , calling him " lazy " and saying fans " would get their hot dogs and beer when he fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unable to fully enjoy his new title , Douglas began to sink into the self-fulfilling prophecy of one his own worst habits - eating . <p> In 1989 , he received treatment in an alcohol abuse program after his arrest for drunken driving . <p> There are days he 'd like to turn his back on all this , grab a cold one , put up a gone fishin ' sign in his front yard and climb inside his Caddy . But he knows there 's no turning back . <p> As the weeks of training camp dragged on , Douglas visualized the worst . <p> " It 's that fear , you 're thinking the worst , " he says . " It keeps you going . You want to stop , but it 's like , ' No , man , I got ta push through this . ' I hit the wall in Tokyo - now I got ta knock that sucker down . It 's put a lot of pressure on me , man . Like , ' Oh , God , what have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Douglas was getting beat by the David Beys , Mike Whites and Jesse Fergusons of the world . When he was punching out of work early in his first title shot against Tony Tucker in 1987 . Or when he was an unemployed and a largely unwanted fighter laying carpet and wondering about what might have been . <p> There were no expectations . No well-intentioned but meddling fathers or demanding managers to please . And , of course , no payoff . <p> " He always seemed to lose his will , " says Michael Spinks , the former light-heavyweight and heavyweight champion . " Buster still wears that jacket today . When people think of Buster , they think of the guy who has quit before . That 's why people underestimate him . But I think he likes what has happened and I do n't see him giving it up . " <p> But he did in the Tucker fight . He dominated early and folded his tent late . He later blamed his performance on in-camp bickering . He fired his father , ex-middleweight Billy Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . <p> " Sometimes your mind can overrule you . I went in to do it , but when it came down to crunch time , mentally I was out of it , " he says . " But nobody saw what was going on behind the scenes . That 's what this stupid ass ( Holyfield ) thinks - that I 'm a quitter . I 'm gon na ( mess ) him up . " <p> Now 30 , Douglas has the benefit of perspective . He knows anonymity is just one sweeping left hook away . Still , it 's a knock-down-drag-out-war with his natural instincts . <p> " Buster is not a fighter , per se , " says Peyton Sher , longtime matchmaker and confidante . " He 's a nice guy . He likes to enjoy life , be nice to people . He 's not on the streets looking to pound out someone . He 's a gentle guy . ... He does n't visibly show the killer instinct that 's necessary in a survival fight . He performs based on the caliber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to remind myself ( what I need to do ) if I want to stay at this level , " he says of the champagne-and-caviar lifestyle he has enjoyed in recent months . <p> That said , Holyfield may be just what the doctor ordered . <p> Holyfield is the antithesis of the champion . His work ethic is peerless , his very being the essence of " can't-touch-this " desire . One suspects Holyfield would crawl on his belly over shards of glass to his hometown of Atlanta before he would ever wave a white flag . <p> " People fight better out of fear , " Holyfield said recently . " A good fighter brings out the best in you . " <p> Douglas proved that once . It remains to be seen if the hands of fate caress his face again . CUTLINE : ' MOMENT OF TRUTH ' : James ' Buster ' Douglas , left , defends his heavy weight boxing title tonight ( 10:35 EDT , pay-per-view TV only ) against the undefeated Evander Holyfield at the Mirage resort .
