Section : Cover Story <p> Flash back for a moment to Black Monday 's 508-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average . Remember how , as the price of your stocks and equity mutual funds rambled by 20% or more , you kicked yourself for being a tad greedy and not cashing in some of your hot investments earlier ? Well , the latest stock market rally may give you a chance to redeem yourself . " Now is a great time to start taking profits in investments that have had a nice run-up , " advises Richard Fontaine , a Baltimore money manager . " That 's exactly what I 'm doing . " Specifically , Fontaine has taken profits of roughly 30% in stocks he believes have peaked for now , such as Nordstrom ( OTC , $34.25 ) , the Seattle-based retailer , and Bank 0f Boston ( NYSE , $12.25 ) . <p> True , stock prices have n't completely lost touch with reality as they had three summers ago . The price/earnings ratio for Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index recently hovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the P/E of 23 that the S &P; hit in August 1987 right before the crash . And there are also still a number of buying opportunities , especially among stocks of gas and electric utilities and small , undiscovered firms whose shares have not zoomed along with the broader market . Nevertheless , several stock market and economic indicators are flashing yellow , if not red , warning signals ( see the box on page 84 ) . Thus , all investors should turn a critical eye toward their portfolios and consider doing the one thing that comes hardest to most of them : chopping back on some of the securities and mutual funds that have flourished the most lately . Here are some of the investments that market analysts see as prime profit-taking candidates : <p> Overpriced household-name stocks and the mutual funds that specialize in them . Stock prices of many large , well-known companies have been bid up to extraordinary levels , partly because of a flood of cash into index funds . These mutual funds and pension accounts , which aim to match such performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with big-name securities . But , cautions Christopher Niemczewski , a Washington , D.C. money manager , " when investors start selling these indexes , large stocks may fall faster than the rest of the market . " Two stocks he views as timely sells : Boeing ( NYSE , $58.50 ) , now trading at more than three times its book value ( the difference between a company 's assets and liabilities ) , and Upjohn ( NYSE , $41 ) , whose share price , says Niemczewski , is " about 30% north of where it should be . " <p> Index fund investors might want to lighten up too . Sheldon Jacobs , editor of the No-Load Fund Investor newsletter , suggests paring back your S &P; 500 index fund holdings to no more than 25% of your equity portfolio . <p> Stocks and mutual funds that are particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn . When the nation slips into a recession  --  which many analysts say is a strong possibility over the next 18 months  --  stocks in economically sensitive industries will be among the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president at Equitable Capital , a $38 billion institutional money manager , suggests getting out of cyclicals such as Du Pont ( NYSE , $38.50 ) and Alcoa ( NYSE , $64 ) . Though he likes the long-term prospects for both companies , Stewart notes that in the short term " they 'll both get hit if the economy softens " because business demand would fall off for their fundamental products . <p> You might also want to take gains if you are a shareholder in sector mutual funds that focus on stocks of technology , retailing , paper or chemical companies , which would slump in a recession . James Stack , editor of the newsletter InvesTech Mutual Fund Advisor , recommends selling Fidelity Select-Biotechnology and T. Rowe Price Science &; Technology funds . <p> High-yield stocks with shaky dividends . A yield of 10% or so today can cushion the fall in a stock 's price and prop up your portfolio 's return . But if the dividend gets cut or eliminated by its company , as may happen during a business downturn , the stock 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safety checkup and jettison the ones with wobbly dividends . Stocks of money center banks are prime candidates . Also , sometimes weak earnings put a dividend in jeopardy . Geraldine Weiss , editor of Investment Quality Trends , a newsletter that monitors stock yields , cites the clothing manufacturer Hartmarx ( NYSE , $11 ) as an example . The stock has a tantalizing 11.4% yield , but last year 's earnings of $0.89 a share fell short of covering the $1.20 dividend . As a rule of thumb , Weiss contends , you should be wary of a company paying out more than 50% of earnings to cover its dividend . Standard &; Poor 's Stock Reports , available in major public libraries , can provide the necessary information about earnings and dividends . <p> Closed-end stock funds selling at a premium . Unlike the traditional , open-end mutual funds , closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares that then trade on exchanges like stocks . When demand for them is especially strong , these funds can sell at a premium  --  that is , a price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's when investors should bail out . " A premium indicates a closed-end fund is probably overvalued , " says Ron Olin , president of Deep Discount Advisors , a Houston-based money-management firm that monitors closed-end funds . " So you 're better off selling before the premium narrows or disappears . " Among the closed-end stock funds that Olin recommends investors cash in are the Spain Fund ( NYSE , $17 ) and the Germany Fund ( NYSE , $14 ) , which are selling at : premiums of 113% and 7% . <p> Any stock that has quickly doubled in price . James R. Smith , a Riverside , Conn. investment adviser , suggests selling half the shares you own of any stock whose price has doubled or more within the past year . Two whose shares soared because of successful product : launches : Microsoft ( OTC , $76 ) , one of the largest software makers , and US Surgical ( NYSE , $46.25 ) . " Once a stock moves so quickly , chances are it 's become fully valued , " says Smith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking for another undervalued investment to buy with your profit . " <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> by Walter L. Updegrave <p> Reporter associate : Prashanta Misra <p> OUR ELVES CAST A COOL EYE ON BUYING STOCKS <p> Is the recent surge in stock prices the start or the end of something big ? To answer that question , we once again consulted the MONEY elves  --  six indicators introduced in the November 1989 Wall Street column as a way to gauge the future course of the economy and the stock market . Though our puckish prognosticators are far from unanimous , their consensus is clear : the economy is sluggish at best , and each run-up in stock prices makes the market look more vulnerable to a significant setback . The details : <p> Our most downbeat elf is the Dow price-to-book ratio . It measures whether stocks are selling at fair values relative to assets . At the end of June , the ratio stood at a lofty 2.6 , just one-tenth of one percentage point below its level before the October 1987 crack-up . <p> A measure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been tilting negative . When the number of stocks selling at 52-week highs grows and new lows fall , stocks are likely to go up . Lately , though , fewer stocks have hit price peaks and the new-low camp has expanded . <p> The Dow Jones average yield suggests that the market has room for a 10% gain before it reaches an unequivocally ursine terrain . But at 3.7% , the Dow yield is dipping closer to 3.3% , a level that signals a precarious stock market . <p> Our three economic indicators provide mixed signals . Weak retail sales have pushed the inventory-to-sales ratio into the pessimistic range . Yet initial weekly unemployment claims of 340,000 to 370,000 are below the 400,000 threshold that usually signals a recession . And the National Association of Purchasing Managers ' index , a monthly survey measuring business activity , is borderline positive . In June , 51.1% of the 300 managers polled expected business to improve . A reading of under 50% is considered to be gloomy . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By Walter L.
