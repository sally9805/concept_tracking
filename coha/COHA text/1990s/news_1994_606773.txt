<p> They had interned for congressmen when they were in high school . They met years later on Capitol Hill , had their first date in the Longworth cafeteria , got engaged on the balustrade of the Capitol Dome and together are about to lose their jobs . <p> In John Edgell 's words , he and his wife are " Hill rats " about to become symbols for Republican retribution . <p> So is Sherry Ruffing . In the Rayburn building office of defeated Rep. Dan Glickman ( D-Kan. ) , she cradles her month-old daughter against one shoulder and a phone against the other , calling every useful person she can think of in her search for a new job . <p> Ruffing never saw it coming . At a preelection Sunday brunch to show off newborn Caroline , she reassured friends that there was no way her boss could lose . <p> Legislation she had worked on for two years passed just before she took maternity leave , bringing more than 2,000 jobs to Glickman 's district . Besides , his opponent was , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow people to carry concealed weapons . <p> Shock is a common commodity on Capitol Hill , along with bewilderment , depression and fear . You can feel the angst among the hundreds of people who know they 're unemployed and the more than 2,000 who expect , but hope not , to be . Its trademark is silence . Silence punctuated by nervous bursts of laughter akin to whistling through the graveyard . Silence interrupted by the thunk of files hitting the trash bin lining the broad marble hallways , by murmurs of commiseration . <p> " Everyone is going through the seven stages of grief , " Edgell said . " The funny thing is that I started with acceptance and am working backwards through shock , grief , anger , sadness , remorse and guilt . " <p> Ruffing 's anxiety is aggravated by the fact that her husband 's small business has n't been paid since July by its main client . Still , she said , she knows she should n't feel so traumatized , because " it 's a fact of life that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She and almost everyone on the Hill have faced election joblessness before . But this time is different  --  not a wave but a tsunami . <p> The reverberations already are being felt . A committee staffer is pulling his son out of Montessori school . A congressional staffer whose mortgage came through Nov. 8 is trying to hide her precarious job situation from the lender . A legislative committee staffer who is HIV-positive is scrambling for any government job so he will not lose his health insurance . A number of people are scheduling elective surgery before their health benefits run out . Many , hoping to be the one out of 100 or 1,000 who keeps a job , do not want their names used . <p> An office manager for a congressional committee said the uncertainty means that her two sons will have a very circumscribed Christmas . She has n't had the courage to tell her 9-year-old that he will not be able to have a birthday party . <p> Last year , when she was tightening her belt after a divorce , she explained that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take friends bowling this year . But that would cost at least $ 100 , and once again she ca n't afford to splurge . <p> She overhead a conversation between him and his older brother that makes her suspect he knows she will disappoint him again . <p> " With children you ca n't just continue to put them off to the next year . The next thing you know they 're adults and they 've missed out on what their childhood should have been . " <p> One paycheck away from being unable to pay her mortgage , she finds herself looking out the window at the street people in her neighborhood . " I think to myself , tomorrow that could be me . To know I could lose everything in 90 days leaves me almost speechless . " <p> In her 20 years on the Hill , she has lost jobs before , but the competition outside has never seemed as fierce , and there was always the hope of a Democratic refuge inside . Not this time . <p> Not only did the Democrats suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of both houses . Every committee and subcommittee headed by Democrats soon will be headed by Republicans . And the new guys now can appoint people to jobs that range from lowly aides for a few hundred dollars a week to legislative directorships that pay six figures a year , some just a few pennies under a senator 's $ 133,600 salary . <p> The ratio of Republicans to Democrats on committee staffs likely will be turned upside down . In the House , where Democrats have clutched control for 40 years , as many as 80 percent of committee staffers work for what is soon to be the minority party . <p> Moreover , the Republicans vowed before the elections to cut congressional staffs by one-third . No one expects them to cut their own appointees . Democratic Hill rats compare it to the factory closing in a one-company town  --  with one important difference . <p> " Both parties have so demonized Washington that no one expects an outpouring of sympathy " from wage earners elsewhere , said Jim Peterson , Glickman 's soon-to-be former press secretary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffs , have families and mortgages and car payments . <p> " We all have our individual , personal dilemmas , " said a staffer who asked not to be identified . " The American people need to hear that we are the same as them . " <p> For the moment , Edgell is a staffer on the Government Operations subcommittee for information , justice , transportation and agriculture . His wife , Bradley , is legislative director for defeated Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky ( D-Pa . ) . They have been a double-income , no-kids couple who , if they eat lots of macaroni , can pay their mortgage for at least six months after the paychecks stop . <p> So they are careful to say they do n't want pity , and they know they 're in no danger of getting any . " I feel like I 'm about to bungee jump on a fishing line , and I 'm sure it will bring a lot of glee to a lot of people 's hearts to see Democratic staffers hitting the pavement , " Edgell said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be House speaker , acknowledged the likelihood of large-scale staff changes in a letter to outgoing Speaker Thomas S. Foley ( D-Wash . ) . " We are conscious of the fact that the Holidays are rapidly approaching and that many staff will have to make future plans , so we will proceed as swiftly and decisively as we can manage . " <p> The staff in congressional offices already know their fate . Those working on committees wo n't be sure until the pink slips arrive . That has set people off on emotional roller coasters . <p> " Wednesday after the election , I was in shock , " said Audrey Bashkin , a lawyer on the House Science and Technology Committee . " Thursday I felt euphoric , thinking it would all work out . Friday I was scared . Saturday I felt good and energetic . Sunday was bad . " <p> People talk about their job prospects optimistically or pessimistically , depending on when they 're talking and to whom . A man with two children and a wife who works outside the home only nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow set of special skills . It 's always been a problem with congressional employment  --  it leads to other congressional employment , or to legislative relations with federal agencies or private groups . " <p> But it is not clear that private interest groups will be anxious to hire Democrats to represent them in a Republican-dominated Capitol . On the other hand , out-of-work staffers offer expertise in narrow niches and in a variety of broad categories . " I 'm a wonk , a hack and a politico , " said Edgell , referring to his skills in policy , public relations and politics . <p> Even in their brighter moments , many people know nothing will replace the Hill for sheer excitement , for a feeling of doing important things . <p> " It 's a rare job that is fascinating and that gives you a chance to actually do something good for people , " said Bashkin , mentioning legislation she worked on that brought information technology to rural areas . <p> But losing that kind of job , however painful the experience , has brought some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happens , you have to view it as an opportunity and a time to reassess , " said Lisa Moss Perez , an executive assistant for defeated Rep. Don Johnson ( D-Ga . ) . Her husband , Ed , also is in a precarious position , working in the Washington office of the State of Texas , which is about to get a new Republican governor . <p> Or take the Hill staffer who got mortgage approval on Election Tuesday , lost her job on Wednesday and got a marriage proposal on Thursday . The experience , she said , let her see her fiance 's true colors . " He must love me if he 'd take me without a job , " she said . <p> Others speak of how humbling the experience has been , and how it helps them empathize . <p> " What we 're going through is what America has gone through , " Edgell said . " Maybe the silver lining to this is that both Republicans and now Democrats now know what it feels like to be out of a job @ @
