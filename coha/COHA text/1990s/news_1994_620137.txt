<p> JUDGE ' OVERTHROWS ' VOTES OF 4,624,825 <p> Editor  --  I speak for the Americans . Let our voices be heard . I speak for the honorable practice of voting for what we believe in . Let our approval be recognized ! A single Superior Court judge can make a restraining decision and defeat the efforts and votes of 4,624,825 Californians . This is in direct violation of the rights of the American citizen ! <p> Proposition 187 's approval is not a racist reaction . It is a simple verification of law and order . The individual is either enjoying the privilege of living in this country legally  --  or violating our laws and should face immediate expulsion . There is no valid argument against these statements . Americans , let your voices be heard so loudly that our elected officials must listen and listen until this situation is corrected . The American voter is the basis of stability for the freedom of the United States of America and our people . <p> ROBERT D. ROWE <p> ROSALEEN ROWE <p> Corning ( Tehama County ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters of California , in their wisdoms , have passed Proposition 187 . This accomplishment will save us millions of tax dollars to support illegal immigrants ' education and medical care . And why not ? Does any Californian believe that the many countries south of our border would allow U.S. citizens similar free care ? Or , for that matter , would any country elsewhere in the world take care of U.S. citizens ? <p> The opponents of Proposition 187  --  the dollar-hungry educational and medical industries  --  can now devote their full time and service to us , the taxpaying citizens of America ! <p> FORREST M. SETER <p> Fairfax <p> . <p> TRAIN OF THOUGHT <p> Editor  --  The other day as I was leaving San Jose and heading north , I noticed the cities on the road signs . They read San Jose , Santa Clara , Los Gatos , Los Altos , Palo Alto . Taking the slower route ( El Camino Real to Alameda de las Pulgas ) , the signs displayed new city names : La Honda , Pescadero , San Gregorio , Portola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way to San Rafael , I tuned in an angry lady calling a talk show to discuss Propoition 187 . <p> " I sure hope its victory sent a clear message , " she said . " Hispanics and Latinos just do n't belong here . " <p> " Interesting train of thought , " I said aloud as I pulled out my East Bay map to see where the city of Dublin was . <p> J. PATRICK MURPHY III <p> Redwood City <p> ( formerly Mezesvlle ) <p> . <p> DO N'T BLAME THE GUNS <p> Editor  --  So Mayor Frank Jordan thinks that the recent shooting by a crazed gunman in San Francisco demonstrates the need for a ban on these type of firearms at a " federal level . " Never mind that these military-style guns have already been banned in California and the recent so- called crime bill also banned these same type of firearms along with over 10-shot ammunition magazines . It looks like the mayor is running out of excuses trying to blame guns . Perhaps our good mayor should focus instead on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object used . Like the drunk driver , we need to hold the individual responsible for their behavior in society . <p> JOHN S. ARMANINI <p> San Rafael <p> . <p> ' SOCIALIZED HOUSING ' <p> If the Republican Congress is to be true to its word and begin to eliminate " big government " programs , why not start with the tax deduction for home mortgage interest ? After all , this particular program represents classic government intervention in a free market economy . The federal housing subsidy that all home owners now enjoy amounts to nothing less than " socialized housing . " If the Republicans are against " socialized medicine , " why do n't they end their support for the current " big government " housing program ? <p> MICHAEL R. BRENNER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> NEWT 'S ' INTRUSION ' <p> Editor  --  So Newt Gingrich says he wants less government . At the same time he wants to dictate to the country where , when , how and what kind of reading we do , prayers we make , and sex we engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. BRONSTEIN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> POSTAL SERVICE RESPONDS <p> Editor  --  We found the article on the U.S. Postal Service on November 16 among the most slipshod and sensational of stories we have seen in recent memory . <p> Consider these facts : <p> * Independent opinion sampling by Opinion Research Corp. , of Princeton , N.J. , showed recently that 85 percent of the public rates the Postal Service as excellent , very good , or good . <p> * Independent testing by Price Waterhouse shows that nationally 83 percent of first-class mail meets our overnight service commitments . <p> * With 10 billion piece growth in the past two years , volume continues to grow . This year the Postal Service will move 176 billion pieces . <p> * The Postal Service is changing and adapting to the competitive marketplace . Our wide- reaching reorganization of 1992 annually saves rate payers $ 1 billion and has enabled us to hold postage rates steady for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year . <p> * In fiscal year 1994 , we bettered our budget , after critics and cynics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , the Postal Service continues to operate without tax dollars . <p> Sure , we make mistakes . Any organization that moves 580 million pieces of mail daily and stops at 123 million addresses every day will . <p> Our employees are committed to improve service and to meet the challenges of competition which we have today in every class of mail . America 's Postal Service is poised to remain the most productive , least costly , and most customer-responsive postal service in the world . <p> FRANK P. BRENNAN , Jr . <p> Media Relations <p> United States Postal Service <p> Washington , D.C. <p> . <p> ' JUST LEAVE ' <p> Editor  --  In recent months , the O.J. Simpson trial has shined a light on a problem that is faced by many people in this country today , spousal abuse . Too many people stay in these situations due to fear . The fear of being alone , penniless , homeless and childless . Not to mention being stalked or possibly even killed . Nowadays people are finally realizing that there is a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My message to these people is : When you 're tired of hiding the bruises with makeup and clothes , tired of feeling guilty for something that 's not your fault , tired of living in pain , JUST LEAVE . You can live a happy , productive life . I know this from my own experience . I too was once a battered wife . Do yourself and your children a favor , get out and do n't look back . <p> TAMI JACKSON <p> Redding ( Shasta County ) <p> . <p> ONE MAN 'S RITUALS <p> Editor  --  Forgetting , for the moment , the three basic " food groups " for Letters to the Editor  --  politics , religion and sex  --  I write to express my gratitude and relief for both the end of the strike and the return of my home- delivered morning Chronicle . During the strike it was almost impossible to begin my morning ablutions which , for decades , have ritualistically commenced with reading the Ole Chron 's obituaries and death notices while " sitting on the throne . " <p> THOMAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NO MORE <p> Editor  --  Whew ! A morning without Caen was like a morning without coffee . <p> JACK GREEN <p> San Mateo <p> . <p> CARDS FOR DIEGO <p> Editor  --  I am a fifth-grade student at Beamer Elementary School in Woodland . We are studying about San Francisco in Mr. Spongberg 's class . We would appreciate it if some of the kind people in your city would send us postcards . <p> DIEGO SOLORIO <p> 247 Palm Avenue <p> Woodland CA 95696
