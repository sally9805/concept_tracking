FOR ISRAELIS OF YITZHAK RABIN 'S generation , perhaps the single most valued quality an individual can have is summed up by the word dugri . The concept is quintessentially Israeli even though the term itself , somewhat ironically , comes from Arabic . It refers to a manner of behavior that is simple , direct , honest . It conveys the idea of placing substance before style , of stripping away layers of subterfuge , of making no attempt at pretense or deception . <P> More than anything else , Yitzhak Rabin 's life can be seen as an object lesson in dugri . When Rabin spoke , whether he was being cold or sentimental , he said what he meant . He once expressed a wish that the Gaza Strip would simply drop into the sea and disappear . But he also possessed a simple , human eloquence . Signing the Oslo accords at the Washington ceremony , he addressed the Palestinians with the following words : " We , like you , are people who want to build a home , to plant a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in dignity , in empathy , as human beings , as free men . " In action too Rabin believed in strongly pursuing a straightforward  --  if often difficult  --  policy . When it came to fighting the Arabs , he was prepared to go to great lengths ( in 1987 , as Defense Minister , he is alleged to have instructed his troops to " break the bones " of Palestinian demonstrators in the intifadeh ) . But he was likewise willing to go enormous distances in pursuit of peace . Last Saturday pursuit of that goal took him all the way to his grave . <P> During his lifetime , Yitzhak Rabin stood at the very center of nearly every major event in his nation 's history . For that reason his own story , to a large extent , mirrors that of Israel itself . Four months after his birth on March 1 , 1922 , in Jerusalem , the League of Nations adopted the British mandate for Palestine , which affirmed Britain 's commitment to support the establishment of a Jewish homeland . At age 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best way to serve his country " was to prepare myself to become a farmer . " He graduated with that ambition still intact , but World War II forced him to postpone his plans to study hydraulic engineering at the University of California . Instead he joined the Haganah , the Jewish underground army ( to which his mother had also belonged ) , and was swiftly invited by the swashbuckling Moshe Dayan , then a young commander , to join the Palmach , an elite strike force . <P> Within a month Rabin was participating in the daring sabotage raids for which the Palmach was renowned . In Syria his job was to slither up telephone poles and cut the wires so the pro-Nazi forces of Vichy France could not send for reinforcements . By 1944 he had been promoted to deputy battalion commander and had developed such a reputation as a shrewd military strategist that senior officers regularly sought his advice or opinions . <P> After the war the British government prevented the immigration of Holocaust survivors from Europe and forced the return of those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrath of Jewish settlers in Palestine . In the fall of 1945 , thanks to his growing status in the Palmach , Rabin found himself a key participant in a dramatic raid to rescue 200 Jewish refugees whom the British were holding at the Athlit detention camp .
