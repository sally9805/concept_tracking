Gil and Harold worked together at the Jitney Jungle grocery store in north Biloxi  --  that 's where they met . Gil was from Tarzana . His family had moved to Mississippi when he was in his early teens . His father did something for NASA , so they moved to Picayune , just outside the NASA complex . Later , Gil had gone two years to the George Tyler Community College in Belhaven , and then , when the casinos came in on the coast , he had moved down to Biloxi . <p> Harold was a local boy  --  gangly , tall , awkward , slow  --  born and reared on the Mississippi Gulf Coast , mostly by his mother after his father left when Harold was five . His mother had worked for the county court as a stenographer . After high school , he 'd gone straight to work for Colonel Sanders , and from there to the Jitney Jungle . <p> Gil and Harold shared a distaste for the manager , Clovis Heimsath , who was from Alabama , and who seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> They were stocking and fronting canned vegetables . " I feel like we ought to handle old Clovis , " Harold said , wagging a can of beets at Gil . " We ought to can him ; what do you think ? " <p> " That 's a big amen , " Gil said . <p> " We 're going to need a sealer , " Harold said , giggling . " We 're going to need a butcher 's saw . " <p> " Use the one in back , " Gil said . <p> " I seen this one on television , " Harold said . " They cut off parts whole . Like hands and feet and legs and arms . We 're going to need mighty big cans to put his arms in . " <p> " We 'll cut ' em up and run them through the grinder , have us some ground Clovis . We can design some labels in that computer system of his . " <p> " We ought to do Margie , too , " Harold said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a looker . Her uniform was always cleaner than anybody else 's , and she looked sexy in it . She always had that top button open , and the skirt was real smooth over her backside . <p> " No , maybe not Margie , " Gil said . <p> " You got the burns for Margie , " Harold said . " That 's what it is . " <p> About then Clovis and Margie turned onto the aisle . Clovis touched Margie 's arm and stopped her . They were ten feet from Gil and Harold . <p> Clovis said , " Now ai n't that pretty ? I like to watch a man work . " <p> Margie smiled and waved hello to Gil and Harold . <p> Clovis put one hand against a shelf , disturbing the corned beef hash . " Look at them skittering around up there , " he said . " You ever see two gerbils in a cage-how they go round and round ? " <p> " Hey , Clovis , " Margie said . She gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , boss , " Gil said . " Whatever you say , we 're after it . We 're doing our job here . We 're smoking these cans . " <p> " I 've been thinking about getting them one of those wheels , " Clovis said . " Let them run around on that for a while . " He put his arm around Margie 's waist , around the white plastic belt that cinched her pale pink uniform shirtwaist , and guided her between Gil and Harold . <p> When they got next to the Libby 's at the end of the aisle , Clovis let his hand slip down over her butt . He did n't even turn around to see if Gil and Harold were watching  --  he was that sure . <p> When they 'd gone , Harold said , " He 's going to do her , right now . " " No , " Gil said . " I do n't think so . " <p> " He 's going to do her , " Harold said . " He 's taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her apart . " <p> " She looked kind of unhappy , " Gil said . <p> " You got to pay the price to be head checker , " Harold said . <p> They did more cans until Harold ran out of the small white round <p> potatoes . " I 'm going to the back , " he said . <p> " What do you mean ? " Gil said . <p> " I need more potatoes , " Harold said . He dusted his hands on the seat of his pants . <p> " Sure , " Gil said . " Everybody knows . " <p> " If I happen to see something while I 'm hunting potatoes , " Harold said , " well , be that as it may . That 's just an accident . " <p> " Get caught and we 're slimed , " Gil said . " I need the job . " " I ai n't getting caught . I ai n't doing nothing , " Harold said . <p> " Maybe I ought to come , " Gil said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Harold did an awkward dance toward the back and started singing the Mr. Clean song , but he had trouble remembering details , so he just repeated the " Mr. Clean , Mr. Clean , Mr. Clean " refrain and did the big fairylike sweep down the aisle . <p> " Shit , " Gil said , getting off the overturned red plastic milk crate he 'd been sitting on . He liked the grocery store , liked the order of things , the variety , the people who came and went  --  he thought it was all pretty . He liked the job and the miniature apartment he had on Crouch Street and the new TV he bought at Cowboy Maloney 's Electric City , out on Pass Road . He liked nearly everything about his life , and as he watched this six-foot-five beanpole dance toward the stockroom , he began to fear that his whole life was about to change . <p> Gil found Harold in the narrow , dark-paneled hall leading to Clovis 's office , doubled over and peeking through the hole where the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Gil , telling him to stay quiet , stay quiet . <p> " What 're they doing ? " Gil whispered . <p> Harold flattened his palm over the hole and turned . " This is exactly like that Red Shoes Diary show , " he said . " He 's wonking her right here . She loves it . " <p> " Lemme look , " Gil said . <p> " No , you do n't want to take no look , " Harold said . " You 're too busy . Get out of here . Go rack them cans . " <p> " I 'm taking a look , " Gil said . He put a hand on Harold 's shoulder , gave a little tug , but Harold was surprisingly strong and did n't budge . <p> " Get on out of here , " he whispered to Gil . " You 're making too much noise . " He bent to the hole again , and soon he was making little grunting sounds as if in time with what he was seeing . Gil leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on , Harold , " he said . " Fair 's fair . " <p> " My ass , " Harold . " You got a dollar ? " <p> " You 're going to charge me for a look ? " Gil said . <p> " Get that dollar out here , " Harold said , grinning . He went back to the door lock and pressed his face against it . " Oh , baby , " he said . " Oh baby , oh baby , oh baby . " <p> " Shit , " Gil said . He went into his wallet and got out a couple of bills . The compressor on the big freezer compartment just the other side of Clovis 's office kicked on , and everything in the place started to rattle and hum . <p> " They 're going round the world , " Harold said . <p> Gil grabbed Harold 's shoulder and shoved a dollar into one of his hands , tried to push him aside , but Harold was n't giving up this part . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C'm on . I gave you a dollar , " Gil said . <p> " Price 's going up , " Harold whispered . " Whooee . You go , girl . Uh-huh . " <p> Gil yanked at Harold but could n't get him to move , and in a few seconds more Harold gave up the hole , leaned back against the wall , and shivered all over . " Holy Jesus , " he said . <p> Gil jumped forward , bumped his head into the door jamb , tried to center his eye over the old keyhole . All he saw was Clovis standing by his desk with his shirt on but no pants . He had a lot of hair on his legs . <p> " Where 's she ? " Gil said . <p> " Probably the head , " Harold said . " It 's over left . " <p> Gil kept his eye at the hole , twisting left and right , trying to see more , trying to find Margie . " I do n't see her , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hang on a minute . She 'll be out . Maybe they 'll go again . Gim me another dollar . " <p> " I ai n't giving you squat , " Gil said . " They gone . They ai n't going to do nothing more . I 'm just picking slag here . " <p> " Boy , she is fine , " Harold said . He was rubbing his eyes with his thumbs . " Mmm . Hardworking woman . " <p> " Do n't start up , OK ? I ai n't seen nothing . You 're just giving me nothing . " <p> " Keep your eyes on it , " Harold said . " She 's bound to come out . " <p> Clovis pulled up his trousers and tucked in his shirttail while peering out the head-high glass that let him watch the store from his office . <p> " We better get going , " Harold said . <p> " I ai n't going anywhere till I see her , " Gil said . " They can walk <p> right out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them hello . " " They 're coming , " Harold said . <p> " I do n't care , " Gil said . He kept his face pressed to the door . <p> Clovis 's office was a mess . It was a crummy storeroom with a steel desk and piles of paper around . There were stacks of flats of canned foods , and little eight-by-twelve plaques on the wall . Clovis stood tall in that room . As Clovis straightened his clothes , peeped into the store through the mirrored glass , Gil thought that Clovis did n't have a bad deal at all : like everybody , he got paid for getting in out of the rain , only he got paid more , and got special privileges like Margie , and got to make fun of stock boys like Gil and Harold . As Gil watched , the idea of cutting Clovis into little parts suddenly began to seem more appealing . He imagined draping Clovis over the butcher 's saw and shoving him through so that his leg buzzed off . He heard the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pictured the blood showering out , jetting everywhere . He thought about running an arm through that bandsaw , just like a two-by-four , zipping off a hand . Maybe he would throw the hand at Harold , something like that . But Harold would n't be paying attention , he 'd be over in the corner humping Margie , who 'd be squealing . <p> " What 's happening ? " Harold said . " Let 's go . " <p> " She ai n't come out yet , " Gil said . <p> " Why do n't you ask her about it later , " Harold said . " We 're going to get our ass caught if you keep standing in that door like that . " <p> " I would n't mind sawing him , " Gil said . " But not her . I mean , I want to do her , but I do n't want to saw her up after . " <p> " You 're crazy , " Harold said . " We ai n't sawing anybody . " <p> Gil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was sitting on the floor , his immensely long legs jacked up in front of him . " I know that , " Gil said . " But you 're the big talker . You wanted to put ' em in cans . " <p> " I 'm gone , " Harold said . He struggled to his feet and limped down the hall . Gil pressed his eye to the hole one more time , saw Margie come up to Clovis 's desk , straightening her uniform . When she headed for the door , he beat it down the hall , then cut left and went around to the refrigerator room . He broke open a carton of ice cream sandwiches , peeled and ate one while he waited for Clovis and Margie to clear . <p> Gil and Harold and Margie had lunch together at the McDonald 's by the gas station on the corner of the shopping center . They sat in a booth by the window watching cars go by . Margie was as happy as could be . She waved a french fry at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching . " <p> " We were , " Gil said . " Well , he was . I was more or less bystanding . " <p> " I seen it all , " Harold said . <p> " You mean you did n't get to see ? " Margie said to Gil . <p> " Saw you straightening the uniform , " Gil said . <p> " That 's not too much , " she said . <p> " I thought it was pretty good , " Gil said . <p> " You 're a sweetie , " she said . " Natural born . " <p> " I got two dollars out of him , " Harold said . <p> " To tell you the truth , " Gil said , " I saw more than I wanted . You and Clovis , I do n't know . I 'm troubled by it . I wish you would n't do it anymore . " <p> " What is this ? A declaration of love ? " Margie said . <p> " Hey , boy , " Harold said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid 's booth there in the McDonald 's . <p> Gil said , " I just think it 's unsightly , you know ? It 's kind of beneath you . " <p> Margie smiled real prettily , powerfully . Like a woman will . " Well it is a declaration of love , " she said . " What do you know . " <p> Gil knew she was right , and was proud of himself for saying what he had . There were thunderstorms all that afternoon , and everyone who came into the store was sopping wet . Margie seemed perky behind her register , chatting and laughing with the customers as she pinged bar codes over the reader . Gil was all around the store , working the shelves , the stock , mopping the back . Whenever he could , he went and sacked for Margie , just to be close to her . Clovis was gone most of the afternoon but came back around five and even manned a register . They got the five-to-six rush , then things started slacking off , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after seven , Gil came to the front after resetting the bananas , apples , and oranges in produce . Harold was over there watering things down . Gil caught Clovis and Margie chatting by her register . Clovis had his back to Gil , and as Gil came up he heard Clovis say , " Let 's take a little trip , what do you say ? " <p> " I 'm tired , Clo , " Margie said . " It 'll keep . " <p> He jangled his keys . " I do n't know . I think the Boss is ready to go . " <p> She patted his shoulder and smiled . " Give him a chill , " she said , then she waved . " Howdy , Gil . " <p> Clovis turned , surprised that Gil was so close . " What are you doing here , kid ? You finished in produce ? " <p> " Harold 's handling it , " Gil said . <p> " You mop sixteen and seventeen ? " Clovis said . <p> " Sure did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Clovis said . <p> " Yes sir , " Gil said . <p> " Why do n't you go out front and round up the baskets then , " Clovis said . " Margie and I have a little business . " Margie made a face . <p> " It does n't look like it to me , " Gil said . <p> " What ? " Clovis said . <p> " Let it go , Clovis , " Margie said . <p> " Sure , fine , " Clovis said . He turned back to Gil . " Get the baskets . will you ? Everything 's fine . " <p> " Why do n't you get the baskets ? " Gil said . <p> " Hey , listen , hit your time card on the way out , " Clovis said . " Have I got your address up there ? Thanks for everything . " <p> " Oh , come on , Clovis , " Margie said . " Leave him alone . He probably needs the job . " <p> " If he needs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boss , " Clovis said . " You need the job , Gil ? " <p> " Not bad enough , " Gil said . <p> Margie pulled Clovis down to her and whispered something in his ear . It seemed to go on for a long time . When Clovis stood up and turned around , he was smiling . " I get it , " he said . " OK , fine . If you do n't want to do the baskets , fine . Ask Harold to go get the baskets , will you ? " <p> Gil grabbed the microphone and switched on the PA at the register . " Harold , come to the front . Harold , to the front . " He looked up at the white painted corrugated metal and bar joists and air-conditioning ducts . Sometimes a bird or two lived up there . It was always a mystery to Gil how they could get in . When customers complained , Gil and Harold had to chase the birds out . Once Clovis brought a BB rifle , and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass on a case in Meat . Then they tried herding it out , propping the doors open and running through the store with brooms , throwing things where the bird was sitting on one of the joists . Gil was still looking at the ceiling when Clovis put an arm around his shoulders and started walking him toward the rear of the store . <p> " You know , Gil , " Clovis said , " nobody 's getting hurt here . You should n't get upset just because I have a little bit of good fortune . See , you 've got your whole life out in front of you . Anything can happen to you , but I 'm past forty . I 've got a college degree , and now I 'm paying for a couple of kids that do n't like me very much , and I ca n't sleep . At three o'clock this morning I was up watching Lingerie Dreams II on Pay-Per-View . And I 'm a churchgoing man , so that made me feel bad , just like other things do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm saying ? Do n't know why , do n't seem to have much choice . You look at it one way , and I 'm taking advantage of my high position here at the store . Look at it another way , I 'm an old guy being treated kindly . " <p> " That 's a Continental attitude , " Gil said . " I 've seen that in the movies . " <p> " Well , yeah , " Clovis said . " Maybe it is . But I tell you what , I 'll try to keep it down in the future . How 's that ? " <p> " I think we 'd all appreciate it , " Gil said . He noticed how stiffly he was walking . <p> Clovis pulled away , patted Gil 's shoulder , and turned to go into his office . Gil stopped in the middle of the aisle in front of the packaged meats , idly straightening some rib-eyes and some filets , some strip steaks . Later on , when he went home , he would wonder what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his finger on it , but he would think he had either learned a lesson or missed a step , and not knowing which it was would haunt him for a very long time . <p> <p> By FREDERICK BARTHELME <p>
