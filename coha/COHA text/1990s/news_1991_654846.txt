<p> MY absolute jealous adoration of the rowboat made me current . By current , I mean it gave me something to talk about with the working people of the island , who considered the raspberry-vined Eden their birthstone in the middle of the sea . Even Captain Sam who motored me and my young wife back and forth , with groceries and supplies , to my lonely post as appointed park ranger , talked to me about my boat . <p> The boat was " cranky , " he said , like the people on the island : They 'd survived a lot of things out there . It was a 12-foot skiff , cedar on oak , white lapstrake , with gray oars and white tips , like a seagull . It was low to the water at the gunwhales , waves swirled by above oarlocks , but it was cranky enough to right itself , in a storm , and float or slide like a cork . We bought it on two paychecks and charged groceries on my badge at the local store . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storekeeper , who was glad to have my trade , but told me flatly , " No one cares about that badge around here . " <p> The islanders did have it good , except for the park which split the island . A one-room schoolhouse with a flag , the peace of lanterns when the generator went off at 8 p.m. , fathers who harvested the waters , the nourishment of the deeps . I represented landlubbing tourists , incomprehensible laws about where local kids could camp , the coming of the commercial square-riggers from Nantucket , who stopped long enough to get partiers lost on mountain paths with pairs of broken high heels . Citizens had for years started a fund to trade or buy off the park land , which , as they said , " got on a wrong list . " A petition was then in the works in Washington , D.C. But meanwhile 201 a man and a gun had to " enforce the laws of a federal reservation . " Moi . <p> I was told by my park superintendent , sea miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my officialdom , or I would find my belongings floating in the sea . A low profile was called for . <p> Captain Sam gave me the same advice , towing my boat into the tiny harbor . He pointed out a floating Clorox bottle of his own I could use for a mooring , " Never mess with another man 's mooring . Especially out here . They 'll cut you loose . " <p> Things went quietly for a while . I drove around the island in my ranger truck , hiked the mountain and woods , spent a day walking around the shore with my shell-collecting wife . I stood on the dock and welcomed visitors , directing them , when possible , away from the village . No one called on us and we did n't know anyone to call on . <p> At 5:30 p.m . I would go out for relaxation in my little boat , rowing out to see the island as its residents saw it . My little boat was helping things to work . When I came back to the dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , caught my bow or took my painter . I walked around in the day with imprints of oars in my hands . I felt I was gaining . <p> THEN came the incident . Three college students camped out of bounds and started a small fire on the south side of the island . The village fire department responded , with me . But two acres near the shore were burned . I enjoyed even the smug camaraderie with the volunteer firemen , who told me how impossible it was to watch every acre of the rugged park at night . It was clearly beyond my watchful control . <p> But the next morning I found the little ranger house where I lived in the woods wrapped in toilet paper . The only person who I knew had that many rolls to strew in trees and around the house was the storekeeper . He confirmed it with his eyes the next time I saw him . <p> " Do n't take it so hard , " my wife said . " You 're doing your best . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , my wife had taken to waiting for me on the dock , knitting with the local wives , and getting to know the children . Sometimes out past the light on the open sea I came to quarter-mile swells - big heaves that lifted the boat as if a leviathan was coming up under me . The thought of myself as Ishmael , thrown out of a harpoon boat , oars , rope , and all , began to scare me . Just as though the residents might throw me off the island . How could I get it together ? Protect the village and the whole park ? <p> We were just two and a child . It was n't fair . I began to look at the sea as cruel , cruel . " A pair of ragged claws scuttling across the bottom of the sea201 . " It caused shipwrecks , ate wood with barnacles . Stinging salt . Odd people lived by it . And now , I was sure , bubbling up from the depths , a leviathan encrusted with parasites , sandpaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would watch me sink . 201 What was down , down there , under me ? Who were my enemies ? I had no quarrel with them . <p> I pulled hard , reversing the boat , and headed back to the safe light and passageway . On the way in an osprey screamed at me , mad , mad that I was passing her nest high in the rocks . Before , I had delighted in that scream . <p> MY wife , enjoying the company of another woman on the dock , wanted to try the boat . She had seldom taken the boat out . I held the child and helped her into the boat . I watched with a mixture of pride and wonder as she mastered the heavy oars , from strong arms that carried about our baby . She disappeared in patches of evening sun on the water . She looked beautiful and our baby was beautiful . The woman she had been talking to smiled at me . She understood about two and a child . <p> While I was waiting for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist , a crab fisherman pulled up and began culling his catch at the dock . In shock , I watched him break off the legs of the crabs and throw the heads into the water . Some floated for a few seconds , then went down under the dock , this way and that . That 's what I felt like , defenseless , a head only , no legs , on the bottom . <p> " They 'll grow back , " said the woman , who had her little boy with her on the dock now . <p> " Come on , " I said , doubting it . Then I realized I needed to grow some new legs , here . Who had torn them off ? The government ? The village ? That did n't matter . I could n't be responsible for the cruel things that had happened in the world , or to me . But I could do my errand here : I had two hands and two legs and a wife and a child , same or better as anybody . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stow the oars . " No , silly , I want you to go back out there with me . The cormorants are nesting , hundreds of them . They 're so beautiful the way they fold their wings . " <p> " I 'm so glad you got this boat , " she said , holding our baby in the stern . <p> I was going to tell her about the crabs ; but I said , " And we 're all together in it . " <p> When we came back , we must have been generating an acceptable happiness . The storekeeper was there waiting for Captain Sam and supplies ; my wife waved to his wife and he must have thought she was waving to him . He lifted his hand grudgingly to her , then his wife took up our baby . He looked at me , then offered me a hand up . " They love it here , " said the wife to her husband . <p> " I want to live here forever , " said my wife , happily with the warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , but things went better that summer and we had a few friends who called on us . And though I still remember those crabs at the bottom of the sea , I also recall the shock as the storekeeper pulled me out of the boat , and stood beside me on the dock close enough for the beginning of something .
