Republican Mudbath I. <p> On November 6 Rich Bond , the departing Republican national chairman , attacked former Delaware Governor Pete du Pont for " an act of absolute political treachery . " The crime ? Campaigning for GOP chairman before Election Day , thus before President Bush had lost and Bond had announced he 'd be stepping down . To punctuate the point , Bond also zinged du Pont as " disloyal , unseemly , and cowardly . " Labor Secretary Lynn Martin is n't brimming with happy talk either . Should she fail to win the Republican post , she told an associate , the party will suffer terribly . Why ? Because pro-lifers will have imposed their unpopular litmus test on the party again . ( Martin 's pro-choice . ) Not so , says Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition . The GOP 's headed for trouble , he argues , if the new chairman wo n't unapologetically defend the party 's anti-abortion position . Knuckle under to the Christian right ? Never , says Representative Tom Campbell of California . He 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat the Christian Coalition , founded by Pat Robertson . <p> Vicious as all this sounds , do n't take it too seriously . Chances are , there wo n't be a civil war in the Republican Party . Two fights will attract attention : the battle for GOP chairman and the spat between moderates and born-again Christians . Neither is a clash of titans . The campaign for party chairman involves a tiny electorate , the 165 members of the Republican National Committee . The fate of the party does n't rest on how they vote . The furor over the religious right involves many more people and deeper emotions . But it will fade as soon as Republicans unite in opposition to something President Clinton does  --  by mid-1993 , in all likelihood . Then the real split in the Clinton-era GOP will become clear . With some overlap , the party will divide into the Dole wing and the Kemp wing . <p> The Dole-Kemp fault line has been building for years . It helps that Senator Bob Dole and Housing Secretary Jack Kemp do n't like each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dole is a deficit hawk , Kemp a supply-side advocate of tax cuts . " The supply-side thing is important to Dole , " says Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota , a Kemp ally . " He wants to stamp out supply-side economics more than Bush did . " Dole was skeptical of Reagan 's economic policy . Kemp supported it . Dole backed the 1990 budget deal , which included a large tax hike . Kemp bitterly opposed it . Dole liked Bushonomics . Kemp did n't . With Clinton as president , Dole and Kemp will often join in opposition . " Dole may have been on the pro-tax side of Bush , but he 'll be on the anti-tax side of Clinton , " says Jeff Eisenach of GOPAC . That 's where Kemp will be . But their priorities remain different . Dole 's chief concern is deficit reduction . Kemp 's is tax cuts to spur growth . <p> If economics were the whole of it , the Dole-Kemp split would n't amount to much . There 's more . The Dole camp thinks social issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't say so directly . Instead they speak in code . " The Republican Party must be the party of the big tent , " Dole told the Republican Governors Association on November 16 . " It is the Democratic Party that banned Governor Casey from speaking at their convention . It is a Democrat president who has bluntly stated that there will be litmus tests for judicial nominees . Let them be the party of exclusion , and let us be the party of inclusion .... Our priorities are those of less taxes , less spending , less bureaucracy , and less regulation , " he added . Notice he did n't mention fewer abortions as a top priority . <p> Not that Kemp is a zealot on social issues . On the contrary , he 's been accused of being an economic determinist . And Governor Bill Weld of Massachusetts , who 's a social liberal , calls himself " a Jack Kemp Republican . " But Kemp 's wing is far more receptive to social issue conservatives than Dole 's is . Kemp 's chief allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent pro-lifers . In fact , a leading cop social conservative , national committeeman Morton Blackwell of Virginia , sought to persuade Weber to run for party chairman . Weber thought about it , then declined . Now Kemp , Weber , and Bennett are in daily contact . Bennett believes the press has demonized the Christian right . " The concerns expressed by the religious right are the concerns of most Americans , " he says . " I spoke to the Christian Coalition . I told them I was a Catholic . They applauded me . " <p> Dole starts with the upper hand . As Senate minority leader , he 's the top Republican elected official in the country . For what it 's worth , Bush has anointed him as top spokesman . At a dinner Dole hosted on November 10 in honor of Bush , the president declared : " The thing that I 've admired and respected about Bob is the way he has , without arrogance , taken on this mantle of leadership .... So people can look to him . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And his perch in the Senate assures that he 'll be a constant presence on T.V. interview shows . <p> So will Kemp , but he 'll have to try harder . He already is . Kemp , Weber , and Bennett are forming the GOP equivalent of the Democratic Leadership Council , the moderate group that groomed Clinton and tugged the party to the center . The new outfit , which may be dubbed the Republican Leadership Council , will have a political action arm and a think tank . Both will promote entrepreneurial capitalism and conservative cultural values . Weber , who 's quitting Congress , is the chief organizer of the RLC and is likely to run it ( with Kemp as chairman ) . But he failed to recruit his top picks to head the two RLC branches . He wanted Bill Kristol , Vice President Dan Quayle 's chief of staff , to take over the think tank . Kristol balked at joining an organization that 's a thinly veiled Kemp front . And Spencer Abraham , the director of the Republican congressional campaign committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . <p> For the next year , the Dole and Kemp wings are likely to concentrate on opposing Clinton , not each other . Once the 1996 presidential race begins  --  in 1994  --  they 'll gather their forces and clash openly . Bushies , budget balancers , moderates , party types who are Republicans first , conservatives second , and the army of consultants , publicists , and lobbyists in Washington will mostly line up with Dole . Younger Republicans , tax cutters , social conservatives , and the religious right will tilt toward Kemp . Each wing will have a presidential candidate , or candidates . From the Dole wing , there 's Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney . From Kemp 's side , there 's Kemp and maybe Bennett . <p> The Dole coalition makes sense , but there 's a question about the Kemp group . How can yuppie Republicans be expected to get along with born-agains ? The answer is that the issues dividing them will loom smaller than they do now . Take abortion . The Freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1993 , changing the political landscape . Like it or not , pro-lifers will have to adjust . " No one 's going to try to hold to the 1992 platform , " insists Kristol . It called for a constitutional amendment to ban abortions , with no exceptions . After 1993 , there will be " a more nuanced debate , " says Kristol . Republicans will press for popular amendments to the FOCA restricting abortion on demand . " We 'll be in a position to support things with broad appeal , " says Weber . <p> Likewise , the religious right itself will diminish as an issue ( but not in size ) . One reason is leaders like Reed recognize the harm caused in Houston by the notion that Christian rightists were taking over the party . " There were pro-choice and moderate Republicans across the country who were terrified by what they saw or thought they saw , " says Eisenach . " Rhetorically , we 've got to be inclusive , not exclusive , " says Reed . " We do n't want to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be involved in the process . " They will be . When the presidential race begins , the Christian right will be more courted than condemned . A Christian Coalition poll on Election Day found that more than 40 percent of Bush voters were " self-identified evangelicals . " In the South , the figure was 48 percent . <p> There 's a more important reason why the religious right may grow less threatening . If Republicans discover a coherent message  --  Bush never had one  --  born-agains wo n't be a problem . If the GOP does n't , they will be . After all , yuppies and Christian rightists got along fine in the Reagan years when the party had a positive message with powerful appeal . That message was initially defined in opposition to President Carter 's policies . " I think Bill Clinton 's going to be great for curing what ails us , " says Trent Lott of Mississippi , the third-ranking Senate Republican . We shall see . <p> By Fred Barnes <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
