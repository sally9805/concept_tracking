<p> TO see the very worst in human nature that came with the Iraqi occupation , one need look no farther than the Syrian brown bears at the Kuwait City Zoo . <p> As food is offered to the huge creatures in their filthy cages , the bears are barely able to grunt . Instead , they peer out with dull eyes , the result of nearly seven months of abuse and neglect after Iraqi troops turned the zoo into a military camp . <p> But if the bears ' eyes reflect the worst of human cruelty , the very best in human nature is found in the two Kuwaiti brothers who took it upon themselves to try and defend the animals and bring them food . <p> Ali Mubarak Al-Houti and his brother Suleiman had only been occasional zoo visitors when they watched in horror as Iraqi troops used birds for target practice , ate everything from gazelles and llamas to the pigs in the children 's petting zoo , and left many other rare animals to fend for themselves . <p> " I talked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey , " Mr. Al-Houti said as a monkey hobbled across a square in the zoo , long-since out of its cage . <p> " But he did n't listen . Others I tell them , ' Wait , I will bring you videos , cigarettes , but do not kill the animals . ' And some I saved like that . " <p> Before Aug. 2 , Al-Houti was a sanitation man , Suleiman a security guard . Now they are dressed in red zookeeper fatigues , having come to help out after the zoo 's regular employees fled in August when the Iraqis tried to conscript them . <p> Of the 442 animals originally in the zoo , only a handful survived . The two brothers often brought meat for the lions and tigers , the only animals which now appear healthy . And they say they did what was possible to maintain the zoo grounds , now scattered with the debris of the departed Army , including sandbags and litter . <p> A giraffe , camel , and bison-like Scottish Highland steer wander aimlessly around the zoo grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aziz the elephant has a bullet wound in her left shoulder but is on the rebound , according to John Walsh of the Boston-based World Society for the Protection of Animals . <p> " You can see where they were ramming bars up against the animals to torment them , apart from having shot and eaten many others , " Mr. Walsh said as he watched members of the Army 100th Veterinary Medical Unit pump fetid water out of the hippopotamus pool recently . <p> " They were purely sadistic in nature . We 're trying to identify the general who oversaw this , and bring ( this issue ) before the United Nations so he can be tried under the cruelty laws of this country . " <p> The city zoo is not the only Kuwaiti cultural institution ravaged by the invasion . Equally appalling are the charred remains of the Kuwait National Museum , which scholars say housed one of the world 's top collections of Islamic art . <p> The central bank and the complex of red-brick museum buildings were among the first targets of the invasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priceless treasures to Baghdad . What they could not take was destroyed when the troops subsequently torched the buildings , including the library . <p> The antiquities ranged from medieval Persian carpets to ancient Egyptian crystal chess pieces and priceless manuscripts . All have vanished , and museum authorities are still unsure just what was stolen and what was burned . <p> " I feel as if a part of me is gone , " said museum director Ibraheem Al-Baghli two weeks ago as he looked wistfully at the destroyed buildings . " Each piece was like a son to me , and now they have died . " <p> Buried in the ankle-deep ashes of the main archaeological room are the fragments of a Greek column of Persian design , as well as vases and artifacts from various civilizations that have inhabited offshore Faylakah Island . Beginning more than 3,000 years ago , the island was a trading center and was a stopping point for the armies of Alexander the Great . <p> MAKING reporters on a walk through one burned-out room after another , museum guide Ahmed Al-Tattan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain from a huge 14th-century wooden door from Fez , Morocco . He called it one of the museum 's most important pieces . <p> " It had elaborate carved inscriptions from the Holy Qu'ran , and was the centerpiece of the Islamic wing , " Mr. Al-Tattan said dejectedly , looking at the tall metal frame which once held the door in place . <p> " Really , I had hoped and prayed they had taken it to Baghdad , but now I find the doorknob and ashes here . " <p> Fortunately , 140 of the Islamic section 's 1,500 pieces were out of the country last August in a traveling exhibition currently in Dallas . The collection belonged to Kuwait 's ruling Al-Sabah family , which was the target of Iraqi wrath - as were buildings throughout the city such as the Emir 's residence . <p> Under the cease-fire agreements , Baghdad has agreed to return stolen treasures , as well as gold reserves from the central bank . But the burned remains are grim evidence that much is lost . <p> " Saddam Hussein committed crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime against civilization , " said United States Army Lt. Col. Jeffrey Greenhut , a historian now helping assess the damages with the Kuwaitis . <p> The soldiers also destroyed the adjacent planetarium , firing tank rounds at the metal dome from outside . And they used precious weavings of Bedouin nomads for bedding . These were kept in a carpet museum inside a nearby adobe house that is the oldest building in Kuwait . <p> " Most of those weavings are from Bedouins who primarily live in Iraq , so if their intention was to destroy things Kuwaiti , there 's certainly a bitter irony , " said Manuel Keene , an Islamic art scholar from the US , and a long-term resident of Kuwait . <p> Mr. Keene was one of few Americans who remained in Kuwait throughout the occupation , staying with friends and using a false identity . <p> " I had 20 years worth of papers and research work , and could not bear the idea of leaving them behind to their fate , " the soft-spoken man said . Keene has had a long association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1983 as one of the Middle East 's most outstanding cultural institutions . <p> Not all of Kuwait 's museums have been destroyed . One private collection of gold and jewelry survived when its owner built a false wall to hide it . Institutions such as the Natural History Museum were hardly touched . <p> Some missing items may also have been saved when people hid pieces in their homes . <p> " We still do n't know everything that 's out there , and probably wo n't know until the Iraqis themselves start bringing things back , " said Col. Greenhut.
