It is an accepted feet that teachers are the most important elements in the education of young people . It is equally well accepted that every person has room for improvement . The education community has devised evaluation and supervision techniques to insure that teachers perform the job well . This paper asserts that , at least in the districts studied , teacher evaluation and supervision programs and personnel are failing to provide the feedback and training teachers need to improve the quality of their instruction . The author proposes two recommendations and seven specific actions to accomplish this . Further , the author suggests that these improvements will enhance teachers ' work satisfaction and motivation . Background <p> When design of curriculum is complete , its delivery rests on the teachers ' shoulders . As a chain can be no stronger than its weakest link , the degree to which the curriculum is successfully delivered to students can be no greater than the quality of instruction provided by the teachers . <p> Teacher evaluation and supervision have been extolled as the vehicles for raising the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during curriculum audits and other educational research indicate that the potential of supervision and evaluation has not been realized . Teacher evaluation and supervision programs have been under fire and are widely viewed as being of little value ( Wise , Darling-Hammond , McLaughlin , and Bernstein , 1985 ; Scriven , 1990 ; Poston and Manatt , 1992 ; Darling-Hammond and Sclan , 1992 ) . Indeed , the primary vehicle for delivering curriculum to students , the teacher , is often far below reasonable standards . <p> The purpose of this article is to analyze these criticisms and propose new directions for attaining the highest quality of teaching in our schools . Specifically , the article addresses two problem areas detected during curriculum audits : 1 ) evaluation ratings are inflated , and 2 ) teachers receive little constructive feedback for improvement from supervisors . Inflation of Teacher Evaluation Ratings <p> Research by Neill and Custis ( 1978 ) and Johnson ( 1984 ) reveal that 5-15 percent of the active teaching force is incompetent . Likewise , during classes , seminars and other speaking engagements , the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their schools and across the nation who are incompetent . Without exception , estimates from approximately two hundred groups we have sampled thus far range from 1-20 percent with the majority of estimates falling in the 10-15% range . Without exception , all attendees knew of at least one incompetent teacher in their schools and most estimated a considerably larger number . <p> In contrast , teacher evaluations examined during curriculum audits and other research are contradictory to these data and expert opinions . A plethora of studies and observations reveal that evaluation ratings are grossly inflated . Perhaps this is predictable . Tenure laws and other state regulations combine with union contracts to confound the processes and obscure the results . Wise , et al . ( 1985 ) contend that current teacher evaluation practices allow only a few districts to identify excellent teachers and even fewer to identify incompetent teachers on valid and reliable grounds . Certainly principals ' ability to evaluate instruction has been challenged ( Medley and Coker , 1987 ) . In support of this contention , Langlois and Colarusso ( 1988 ) found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and only two tenths of one percent were " unsatisfactory . " Similar inflation was found in studies conducted in the Georgia merit pay plan ( White , 1990 ) , and the North Carolina teacher evaluation project ( North Carolina State Dept. of Education , 1990 ) . <p> Data collected during audits over the past three years reveal similar findings . Trained audit teams have gathered and analyzed ( 1 ) probationary and tenured teachers evaluation data ; <p> ( 2 ) teacher professional growth plans , and ( 3 ) teacher and principal interview data in five school districts in the Eastern United States . <p> The five districts studied varied in size , socioeconomic status , and ethnicity . Some were large urban districts , while others were small suburban and rural districts . The total enrollment of the five districts was approximately 160,000 students . <p> As illustrated in Figure 1 , the ratings were greatly skewed toward the high side . In most districts , no teachers , including probationary teachers , were found to be below standard , while the large majority were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only by research and public opinion cited previously in this article , but also by auditors ' observations of instruction in the five districts and interviews with teachers and administrators . Auditors ' observations revealed poor instructional practices , particularly in districts where evaluation ratings were highest . <p> In general , learning activities were limited to low level cognition . The little direct instruction which took place was oriented toward low level cognition ; teachers seldom interacted with students ; little or no cooperative learning occurred ; drill and practice were the predominant form of instruction ; teachers demonstrated low expectations for students ' learning , and students copied exercises and directions from the chalkboard and text books . These observations make it implausible that such extraordinarily high percentages of teachers deserved ratings of above standard or higher . <p> Interestingly , when asked about these instructional practices , teachers stated that they used them frequently . When asked the same question about specific teachers , the large majority of principals offered feckless and inaccurate responses such as , " instructional practices are very solid and the teacher is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feedback <p> The belief that workers want to do a good job and make a significant contribution has been widely espoused ( Hackman and Oldham , 1980 ; Deming , 1986 ) . This belief has been well documented for teachers . The vast majority of teachers in training and in practice state that their number one motive for teaching is altruistic , to help others learn ( Frase , 1992 ) . <p> Unfortunately , few school districts are fulfilling their responsibility to provide accurate feedback to teachers . The potential of feedback to improve performance has not been realized . As revealed by the curriculum audit data discussed above and in other studies ( Sergiovanni and Starratt , 1992 and New York Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development , 1983 ) teacher evaluation appears to be purely ceremonial , with little or no intent to improve instruction . <p> Evaluation and supervision can and should be means of providing feedback and direction for improvement ( Duke and Stiggens , 1990 ; Iwanike , 1990 ) . Accurate and straight-forward feedback regarding performance , whether it comes directly from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is crucial to improvement . As Blanchard ( 1981 ) whimsically , but earnestly said , " feedback is the breakfast of champions " ( p.68 ) . This is particularly true for educators . Constructive feedback is fundamental to helping teachers improve instruction and achieve their goals of helping young people learn . <p> This direct connection between educators ' motivation to work and their job role is the key ingredient for experiencing what Csikszentmihalyi ( 1990 ) has called autotelic jobs which deliver flow , the optimal experience . Workers find an inextricable , intrinsic motivation for the autotelic job . To keep this motivation vital , autotelic jobs provide variety , appropriate challenges , clear goals , and immediate feedback : <p> As many teachers before them ( Smylie , 1989 ) , teachers in the audits stated that principals are seldom in classrooms and seldom give constructive feedback . They also said that on those few occasions when principals did visit , worthwhile suggestions were seldom offered . In fact , numerous research studies reveal that principals spend only 2.5-10 percent of each work day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audits provided evidence in support of these percentages . Frequent classroom visitation an &; constant involvement in instruction can provide supervisors with the information they need to provide worthwhile and timely feedback to teachers . Recommendations <p> It is obvious that change is needed . Educators have generally riveted on problems they can deal with and have glossed over problems they often regard as more important but too controversial ( Sarason , 1991 ) . The following recommendations go to the core of what I see as the problem . These recommendations focus on the individual within the context of team cooperation ; everyone 's desire to perform more successfully ; the power of internal motivation , and the value of honest and well-formulated feedback in achieving success . <p> Recommendation 1 : Every school district should have a well publicized policy that includes and embraces the following : <p> A. A strong statement that every child in the district has a right to a highly competent teacher every year and that it is the district 's responsibility to provide this . <p> B. A clear statement on the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of feedback and evaluation for everyone in the district . <p> D. Direction to the superintendent to allocate funds every year for evaluation , supervision , and instructional training . <p> E. A statement that all educational administrators must be instructionally competent and must demonstrate teaching every year for teachers and administrators . <p> F. A direction to the superintendent to insure that principals and other administrators spend 40-50 percent of each day in classrooms and working on curriculum and instructional problems . <p> G. A monitoring system to ensure that all aspects of the policy are carried out and working properly . <p> Recommendation 2 : Shift our paradigm from the " Status quo is okay " to " Together , we can do better . " <p> This shift is undergirded by the following four premises : <p> Everyone has room for improvement . Although this sounds like a statement of the obvious , the research and observation findings reported previously reveal an overriding attitude that it is not the case . Only superior ratings seem to be acceptable to many teachers . This may be due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feedback is given in non-constructive and vindictive ways . Regardless of the reason(s) , we all have room for improvement . <p> Constructive feedback is healthy . Constructive feedback is given by those who approach work with an " abundance mentality "  --  that success for others adds to , rather than detracts , from our own successes . Helping others succeed leads to more success and recognition for everyone ( Covey , 1991 ) . Too frequently , supervisors have approached feedback and improvement with the " scarcity mentality " wherein success is finite . That is , if I help others succeed , there will be less for me . Hence , the feedback is not constructive or meaningful . <p> Success and power lie in intrinsic motivation . High quality feedback can facilitate individual creation of new goals for their own professional growth . These goals can be written in professional growth plans . Accomplishing these goals yields increased internal motivation . Feedback and supervision have all too often been inaccurate , shallow , and at times mean-spirited , rather than helpful and uplifting . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than allowing teachers to plan and achieve new successes in their number one goal of helping people learn . The new spirit of feedback must be one of teamwork with focus on the individual . <p> Recognize the dignity of people  --  that they want to make a meaningful contribution . It is erroneously believed that extrinsic forces can cause people to become intrinsically motivated . This is a transactional or carrot-and-stick approach to motivation . Time and effort can be bought , but intrinsic motivation can not . Buy-offs can work in the short run , but they fail miserably in the long run . Focus on intrinsic motivation is far more powerful . <p> Transformational leadership recognizes the dignity and value of people and their intrinsic motivation to do a job well and perform at optimal level ( Bass , 1985 ) . We have long denied the systematic observations and research that tell us most people find strong motivation in making a meaningful contribution . This is particularly true for educators who enter the profession to help others learn and leave when they are not successful in attaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders in schools provide a workscape where psychic rewards are more likely to be found , where people stand the best opportunity to motivate themselves successfully . They foster teachers ' sense of ownership in the school mission and a strong belief in its importance . They help teachers find the crucial and natural link between job and personal satisfaction . Summary <p> The contention that evaluation and supervision are the primary factors in today 's schools by which instructional excellence is achieved and maintained ( Pajak , 1990 ) is wishful thinking . Rather , this characterization is dead wrong . Teacher evaluation has either lost or has never had a purpose . It has become perfunctory . Little energy is invested , and the teacher receives little , if any , constructive feedback for improvement . In too many districts , the only reason for complying is to meet state requirements . <p> Teachers in many cases have good reasons for holding evaluation and supervision in contempt . Evaluations have not been helpful ; evaluators are not adequately trained in curriculum and instruction , and feedback is either absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not result in instructional improvement . Failure to provide accurate feedback accompanied by substantive and practical suggestions for improvement closes the door to improvement and enhanced intrinsic motivation . This abrogation of duty is malpractice in its worst form . Educators thrive on success in accomplishing their number one goal  --  helping young people learn . Successful supervision and evaluation programs are designed to capitalize on powerful internal motivators , resulting in improved performance and higher personal satisfaction . <p> GRAPH : Figure 1 Distribution of Teacher Evaluation Ratings in Five School Districts , 1987-1990 . <p>
