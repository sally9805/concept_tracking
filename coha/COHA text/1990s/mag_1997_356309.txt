On June 3 , 1977 , I officially got old . Just back from the Cannes film Festival , I 'd been told by my editors at New Times magazine to catch up with Star Wars , which had opened to phenomenal business . And from the moment of the opening crawl , I was baffled . All these dense factoids about Galactic Empires and Death Stars  --  it was like some nightmare of a pop quiz in a course I had n't taken . The sets were Formica , the characters cardboard ; the tale had drive but no depth , a tour at warp speed through an antiseptic landscape . I admired George Lucas ' attention to detail , his Tolkien-like industry in creating a host of alien life-forms , but I remained unmoved . Peering at Star Wars through the telescope of my disinterest , I made this fearless box-office prediction : " The movie 's ' legs ' will prove as vulnerable as C-3PO 's . " <P> That was eons ago , in pop-cultural terms . Records were still on vinyl ; CDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed of ; and films were shown in theaters or , years later , on broadcast TV . Before Star Wars , a blockbuster movie was one that everybody , of every age , wanted to see once . The big hits of the ' 70s  --  Airport , Love Story , The Godfather , The Sting , Jaws  --  were broad based , reflecting the audience 's demographic democracy . Star Wars devised a novel equation : here was a film every teenage boy wanted to see a dozen times . Lucas spoke , from his bionic heart , to the American boy 's love for shiny gadgets , spiffy uniforms , authoritative-sounding technotalk and a hot rod that shoots really cool laser blasts . The film certified a new wisdom : megamovies were now the province of the young male . <P> Twenty years later , much has changed , including Star Wars  --  not the few minutes of noodling by Lucas and his effects mavens but the way we look at the film . Nothing ages so quickly as yesterday 's vision of the future , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can wallow in the film 's sleek retro-kitsch ; even the opening logo has acquired the classic blockiness of a ' 56 DeSoto . One can find endearment in the lame badinage of C-3PO , in Carrie Fisher 's bagel-like hairdo , in the whining and bickering of the lead characters , in the varying pronunciations of Obi-Wan Kenobi and the planet Alderaan . The invocation to " trust your feelings " seems a woozy echo of the ' 67 Summer of Love , not the ' 77 summer of Wars , but Alec Guinness carries himself with the majesty of a Jedi knight and an acting peer . The climactic dogfight , copied in a quillion arcade games , has thrust and logic ; it 's the clearest , most potent narrative section of the movie . <P> By the end , with starsurfer Luke and antihero Han Solo and all the pudgy , pasty-faced rebel pilots finally functioning as a team , Star Wars has declared its intention : to be a celebration of communal subversiveness . The Jedi Force is itself a kind of cosmic team spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters to give kids of all ages the communal kick of a big-screen experience . Some early viewers have applauded the new material ; others ( the true believers ) have booed it . But all cheer when the Millennium Falcon zaps into hyperspace ; it is a video game a thousand people can play at once , and a time machine into movie memory . Who would n't enjoy being in a huge theater with a familiar friend from long ago and far , far away ?
