In my family , Memorial Day weekend means it 's time to plant the annuals and wash the porch . It 's the traditional start of summer , when bicycles get pulled out of the garage and everyone tries to squeeze into last year 's bathing suit . Kids start dreaming in color again . On Memorial Day , several dozen members of my extended family gather at a park near my rural hometown in upstate New York to eat barbecued chicken and deviled eggs . Afterward we play softball while my Uncle Harvey limbers up his lawn chair . But for us the best thing about the holiday is the part that has become an afterthought for many people  --  the remembering . <P> We gather at the family plot in the ancient local cemetery to remember loved ones and hear about relatives we wish we had known . The grownups plant flowers and bicker over who does the weeding . Children five or under get buckets to haul water . The older kids wander off to check out the fancier monuments of our neighbors . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talk about our family . <P> We read down the list of ancestors , going back to the Revolutionary War , whose names are etched on our granite memorial , and trade snippets of their lives . There is my great-uncle who , in mid-life , ran off with the circus . His sainted wife 's stone sits forlorn , wedged into the grass . We also celebrate the ordinariness of our ancestors  --  the soldiers , teachers , farmers and parents who spent purposeful lives in this little town . Our visit to the cemetery is where we work out our connection to these people , and to one another . <P> Psychologists stress the importance of ritual in binding families together , and Memorial Day presents a great opportunity . This year , if you 're driving to the beach , turn off the car radio and explain to your kids why everyone has the day off . On the way out of town , swing by the war memorial . Your kids may see it every day , but now you can explain what it is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , they need to be taught that we honor the sacrifice of others . Find out if there 's a parade nearby , the kind with high school marching bands , little kids with streamers on their bikes , and beribboned old veterans  --  the people for whom this day was created . <P> If you 're doing yard work over the holiday weekend , get your kids to help you plant an oak sapling or lilac bush in memory of a loved one or just to mark the day . Pull out a photo album or a box of old pictures . Then help your children sort out the names and faces of people they 've never met but would probably have enjoyed . Tell them stories about their family , even if you can dredge up only dim memories or anecdotes  --  like the one about my mother , who once found an alligator in the kitchen eating out of the cat 's bowl . This is how they will learn that for better or worse , there is no family like theirs . <P> Teach your kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balls . Before you stoke up the grill this year , raise a glass to the people who came before you  --  those who fought for our country or tended the home fires  --  and help your family celebrate its past . <P> E-mail Amy at
