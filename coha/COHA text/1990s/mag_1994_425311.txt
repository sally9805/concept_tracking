It 's Great Business . But Is It Conservation ? <p> A couple of decades ago , if you were to win the lottery , or perhaps commit the perfect crime , you might think of escaping to a place like Manuel Antonio National Park . It 's a fantasy tropical paradise : white-sand beach and blue-green waters , on the Pacific side of Costa Rica , shaded by lush tropical forest nearly reaching the water 's edge . No traffic , no roads  --  for company , just the birds and the white-faced squirrel monkeys . <p> But today you do n't have to be lucky or a conspirator . You can catch any one of the dozen or so daily international flights to San Jose , rent a car or hop on a bus and go to Manuel Antonio by highway . You 'll still find the beach and the forest . The solitude , however , is long gone . <p> One of the most-visited protected areas in Central America , 1,700-acre Manuel Antonio receives nearly a thousand visitors a day during the peak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " strip . " Some 300 monkeys are still there , but their migration corridors have been disturbed , and like the bears of Yellowstone in years past , many have become garbage feeders . <p> Welcome to Costa Rica , whose parks are the crown jewels among developing-country protected areas . In the 1980s , this West-Virginia-sized country won international acclaim for setting aside a fifth of its national territory as parks  --  and received more than half of all the U.S. public and private funding for international conservation . In the 1990s , Costa Rica is again a trend-setter , this time in the booming ecotourism industry . <p> The Costa Rica Tourism Institute , or ICT , and tour operators have aggressively promoted Costa Rica as a destination . ICT uses travel-industry shows , advertisements , and offices in Miami , Los Angeles , and other cities to entice potential visitors with visions of romance and adventure . " Picture graceful , tall mountains , their tips wreathed in clouds , " its brochure invites . " Imagine lush green meadows with rushing rivers and arching waterfalls ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their inner happiness and pride in their land . " In case your imagination fails you , there are 16 pages of color photographs . <p> It works  --  and then some . In August of 1993 , tourism surpassed bananas as the country 's number-one industry . For the past three years , the number of visitors to Costa Rica has increased at a rate approaching 15 percent per year and should reach three-quarters of a million visitors annually in the next year or two , a million by decade 's end . Tourism income has grown even faster , and now exceeds a million dollars a day . <p> More than two-thirds of the international tourists in Costa Rica say they came to enjoy the country 's national parks . The parks are popular recreational destinations for local residents as well , as confirmed by park agency visitation figures . In 1992 , 598,003 visitors were registered , nearly triple the visitation level in 1982 . <p> For the parks , this surging interest is a mixed blessing . To be sure , the dollars from aid agencies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving more than footprints . A recent study by the Inter-American Development Bank ranked growth in visitation , coupled with the park service 's inability to manage visitors effectively , as one of the five most serious threats to Costa Rica 's national park system . <p> " Many tourists , few animals , " a writer grumbled in a major travel magazine , writing about a stroll on the trails of Manuel Antonio . A protected-areas specialist working at Corcovado National Park , on the relatively undeveloped Osa Peninsula , notes , " You can see physical damage to the reef from boat moorings and from being stepped on . " <p> " In general , the higher the volume of tourists , the greater the potential for negative impacts , " says Ray Ashton , author of a manual for ecotourism in Central America , going on to catalog the possible damage : soil compaction , trail erosion , clearing for campsites and other facilities , litter , contamination of surface water , and trampling and collection of plants . <p> And what about the wildlife ? How frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what level of behavioral change represents a threat  --  are still open questions . Different species of wildlife have different levels of tolerance toward interactions with humans . Some thrive ; others retreat and decline . Impacts may vary depending on the type of tourist activity and by season and location within the animals ' territory . Sea turtle beaches , for example , are vulnerable primarily during the nesting season . Other animals may be particularly sensitive during resting or feeding . Wildlife may also be threatened when local people collect feathers , shells , and skins for handicrafts to sell to tourists , or overfish reefs to supply restaurants and lodges . <p> This is primarily theory , logical and reasonable but difficult to document . Ask one of the experts  --  the ornithologists , herpetologists , and other researchers who have visited Costa Rica 's protected areas continuously over the past few decades  --  and the answer will be something like this , from Laurie Hunter , an ornithologist at The Nature Conservancy . <p> " Everyone talks about the environmental impact of tourism , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , on the breeding and nesting behavior of quetzals  --  which of course necessitates having data beforehand . " <p> Quetzals , of course , are one of the most emblematic species , and a fair amount of behavioral data has been collected . But no one knows how many species the Costa Rican parks harbor . Scientists generally concur that some 215 species are of special concern , ranging from vulnerable to immediately endangered . Many of these depend on the parks for their survival . Even so , there are not sufficient data to effectively monitor danger signals or determine their causes . <p> To see the least subtle tourism impacts , one only has to step outside a park boundary and look around . Admirable as Costa Rica 's park system is , land outside the parks is all but unprotected . The immediate result has been what Tirso Maldonado , author of a volume on national-park carrying capacity recently published by Foundation Neotropica , calls a " chaos of construction " surrounding the most-visited parks . <p> In 1993 , more than 3,000 new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them immediately outside protected areas . The construction brings deforestation , erosion , improper disposal of sewage , and a host of other problems . One of the most luxurious of the new resorts razed a hilltop during construction , changed the course of a river by taking out tons of sand , filled a swamp , violated health laws , and failed to get required permits for construction and dynamiting . <p> It 's a classic vicious circle : more tourists bring more hotels , which bring more tourists . They come by land and by sea. , One of the principal factors in the quintupling of visitors to Carara Biological Reserve over the past three years has been the cruise ships that have begun to dock nearby . Visitation is actually incompatible with the purposes of a biological reserve , as established by law  --  but the reserve 's trails and scarlet macaws are an attraction . <p> If cruise ships have been a bane to conservation in parts of Costa Pica , they are one of the critical elements in the success of another of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the south , to the Galapagos Islands , and it 's possible to find some guidance on how to keep visitation under control . <p> During nearly a quarter-century of tourism , this desert archipelago , home of rare and wonderful wildlife made legendary by Charles Darwin , has seen growth rates similar to Costa Rica 's . But visitation has generally been well managed , and it is still possible to encounter a blue-footed booby nesting right on the trail . Despite the fact that the annual limit of visitors is regularly exceeded , strict supervision , together with limited development of land-based facilities , has kept impact to a minimum . <p> The tourism industry in Galapagos has always been water-borne and water-based . A typical visit begins with a 600-mile flight from the mainland to one of the archipelago 's two airports . Passengers immediately pay a rather steep entry fee ( the current value is about $40 for foreigners , less than $1 for Ecuadoreans ) , and transfer to a boat for a one- or two-week tour of the islands . All groups must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose responsibility is to exercise direct control over visitor action in all areas of the park . Visitors are strictly restricted to official trails when they are on the islands . A small fleet of patrol boats also enforces regulations . <p> The Galapagos Islands are governed by a management plan  --  actually several distinct but related plans for the terrestrial and marine portions of the park  --  and a separate plan for tourism . The park 's first management plan , approved in 1974 , established a somewhat arbitrary limit of 12,000 visitors per year . As tourism increased , debate about management tended to focus  --  artificially , according to most experts  --  on how many tourists should be permitted , rather than on more complex aspects of carrying capacity . <p> In 1981 , Ecuador 's president appointed a high-level commission to propose guidelines for tourism management . The commission recommended freezing visitation at 25,000 per year until a tourism plan could be elaborated  --  again , a somewhat arbitrary limit , but based on the Galapagos Park Service 's capacity for management and the approximate capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the official visitation ceiling when the master plan for Galapagos was revised in 1985 . <p> Unfortunately , a decade passed before the tourism plan was adopted in 1991 . Meanwhile , a second airport was constructed . The visitor ceiling was reached and exceeded , and economic problems caused a deterioration in the park service 's management capacity . In the decade preceding adoption of the tourism plan , according to Fausto Cepeda , who serves on the Galapagos Permanent Commission , the number of concessioners offering lodging on the islands doubled , to 82 , and the number of places available on touring boats increased from 664 to 1,400 . <p> Still , despite the burgeoning tourism , wildlife has fared well . Galapagos management plans have established a system designating zones for tourism according to their accessibility , presence of wildlife , coastal scenery , and hiking opportunities . The tourist-use areas are categorized for either intensive use ( groups up to 90 people ) , or extensive use by groups limited to 12 . All groups must be accompanied by a licensed guide . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crowding at the most popular sites . The most serious negative effect , says Cepeda , has been the direct and indirect impacts of the development of industries supporting tourism . " Planning was based on carrying capacity and management of tourist activity , and on the limits of the visitation sites in the park , without recognition of the other problems caused by economic activity . " <p> The new plan for tourism has taken measures to address these problems . There are more regulations on the granting of concessions . Tourist boats and ships must follow assigned itineraries and limit their tours to assigned areas of operation . By causing more dispersal of visitors and encouraging use of additional , less vulnerable sites , the plan will strengthen the Galapagos Park Service 's management capacity . <p> Can Costa Rica implement similar measures to control its national park visitors ? The tourism ministry , says Tirso Maldonado , has financed several studies of carrying capacity and is pressuring the park service to establish new visitation limits for the parks , many of which are exceeding current limits two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no " magic number , " and focusing on ceilings may serve to obscure more important issues . <p> In fact , says Jim Barborak , a parks expert and longtime Costa Pica resident , visitation in Costa Rican parks is " so far below the levels reached in U.S. parks that it 's laughable . " Grand Canyon National Park , which is roughly the same size as Costa Rica 's parks put together , receives 4.5 million visitors per year , while the Costa Rican parks receive just 600,000 annual visitors . <p> " What you 're hearing is the aesthetic cries of people who loved Costa Rica in the old days , " says Barborak 's colleague David Carr , a second-generation sea-turtle expert who has devoted much of his life to conserving the nesting beaches of Tortuguero National Park on the Atlantic coast . " Those days are over . I 'm not trying to save Tortuguero like it was in my childhood . We can save the park , the turtle beach  --  but I 've abandoned any notion that we should preserve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours ' drive from San Jose is the Monteverde Biological Reserve , a private cloud forest reserve where tourists flock to see resplendent quetzals and many other beautiful birds , plants , and butterflies . One portion of the reserve has trails suitable for hiking ; another portion is all but inaccessible . The reserve takes in nearly a half-million dollars a year from its relatively high entry fee ( about $10 ) , fees for guide services , and gift shop . The guide program provides employment and training for local residents while also helping to keep visitors on the trails and otherwise in compliance with rules designed to keep disturbance to wildlife to a minimum . <p> The substantial income makes it possible to invest in trail maintenance , including reinforcement and hardening in wet or erosion-prone areas . Staff patrol the trails and carefully monitor the total number of visitors in the reserve , as well as the number on each trail at any given time . When a trail reaches its limit , new arrivals must choose another route or wait until earlier visitors exit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 a.m . Visitors , however , cheerfully accept both the high fee and the occasional wait , knowing that they will encounter wildlife rather than crowds , and that they can enjoy the cloud forest in relative comfort , safety , and quiet . <p> The national parks may not be able to adopt all of these measures . By law , they have an entry fee of less than $2 , and there is a chronic shortage of staff , due in part to civil-service cutbacks imposed by economic restructuring . Although the Costa Rican park staff are generally praised for their level of training and esprit de corps , none are specifically trained in visitor management , and few have the time to spend assisting visitors , directing them onto appropriate trails , and explaining or enforcing rules of conduct . Most of the parks do have trail systems , but few if any are designed to concentrate visitors in the less fragile scenic areas , leaving sensitive ecosystems undisturbed . <p> Proposals to increase staffing and programs , even if financed by visitor fees , pose problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel to work in the parks and managing programs of assistance . Visitor management  --  training , tools , and staff is a promising area for private assistance . <p> If it is no longer possible to pass a week in perfect solitude at Tortuguero or Manuel Antonio , neither is it very likely that thundering herds of tourists will ultimately despoil the Costa Rican parks . Eventually , word of mouth about crowded conditions in Costa Rica and the growing promotion of equally beautiful parks in Guatemala , Honduras , and Panama are likely to cause the international visitors to disperse . And there is every reason to believe that Costa Rica , with its outstanding conservation record and its special access to international funding and support , will again take the lead in ensuring both good experiences for visitors and conservation of parks and their wildlife . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : More than two-thirds of the international visitors to Costa Rica come to enjoy the country 's national parks and other protected areas , such as Monteverde Biological Reserve ( left ) , and to see wildlife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : White-faced capuchin monkeys and tree frogs are among the diverse wildlife species found in Costa Rican parks . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Photographing wildlife is a popular activity for visitors to the Galapagos . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Although tourism rates in the Galapagos Islands are growing as rapidly as those of Costa Rica , careful management and well-enforced restrictions have helped to keep visitation under control .
