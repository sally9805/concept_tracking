Most Areas Do n't Need Them <p> Across the United States , some 65 million car owners in 122 urban areas currently must submit to time-consuming , and frequently expensive , auto emissions inspections in an effort to help reduce urban smog . <p> New rules just proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency , in accordance with the 1990 Clean Air Act , aim both to strengthen these so-called inspection/maintenance ( I/M ) programs in some areas and extend them to cover millions more car owners in a number of new areas around the country by 1996 . The total will reach over 75 million car owners living in 177 urban areas . <p> This , despite the fact that for the majority of American motorists , officially mandated inspections are not necessary and otherwise would do little to improve a situation fast on its way to being resolved anyway . <p> Urban smog has , in reality , almost entirely disappeared as a problem everywhere outside of California . Official air-pollution data , in fact , show that most areas with smog levels surpassing government standards will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any enhancement or extension of existing I/M programs . <p> What 's more , the effectiveness of these emissions inspections as a means to reduce air pollution has been questioned by many in the scientific community . Most cars in use do not pollute . A method for identifying cars that do pollute without burdening others exists , but has received little attention by federal officials charged with formulating air-pollution policy . <p> With good news about air pollution and the prospect of problems with the testing , why must a majority of American motorists be subject to continuing emissions tests ? <p> The answer is that the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) had intentionally ignored problems with the data used to influence and implement the recent Clean Air Act Amendments and has since slowed the release of crucial data about improved air quality to the public . And even as new data on improving air quality emerge , the EPA continues to emphasize outdated and flawed information to promote its policies . The inevitable result is that tens of millions of consumers , throughout the nation and in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not based on realistic data . <p> Since these programs have little direct impact on industry , the EPA and state regulatory agencies face little opposition to the continuation and expansion of mandatory I/M programs . The consumer therefore must become the watchdog to insure that such programs are both a necessary and cost-effective strategy for achieving and maintaining our nation 's air quality standards . <p> One Odd Year <p> Prior to 1988 , the consensus thinking among scientists and policy makers was that the nation 's existing emissions testing programs would be deemphasized in the then upcoming Clean Air Act amendments . ( States , in this case , would have been given the choice of whether or not to impose the I/M programs . ) That year , however , was one of the hottest years on record in the Midwest and East . Additionally other weather factors conducive to smog formation were also extreme . <p> The fact is that weather-not auto emissions or other air pollution-is the most important determinant of the number of days a year that are conducive to smog formation . In any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief component of smog ) . Abnormal periods of hot weather , for example , will show a large increase in ozone levels , as warmer temperatures increase ozone formation . <p> The abnormal meteorology of 1988 caused a large number of cities ( 98 ) to surpass the federal ozone standard , some by a wide margin . Because the EPA used air quality data from 1988-and did not adjust for the abnormal weather-it classified all of these cities as in " nonattainment " of the standards in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments . Most cities on the list were falsely given improper rankings in terms of severity of pollution levels , again , because of the biased data . <p> Although the public was exposed to much higher smog levels than expected in 1988 , it must be understood that there is a very low probability of such a year occurring again-that is , only once in the next 25 to 50 years . For example , in Philadelphia during July and August of 1988 there were two periods of 18 to 22 consecutive days above 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There have been no equivalent episodic events in the past 25 years . ( In the East , 1991 was as hot as 1988 , but did not exhibit the long multi-day episodes of high smog levels of 1988 . ) <p> A good analogy is the expected frequency of floods along the Mississippi which might occur in the next 100 years . The chance of a flood occurring can be described as a once in 10 , 50 , 100 year event . The lower the probability of the flood , the greater the severity of the flood . <p> To prevent damage from progressively more severe floods , the height of control structures such as dams and levees must dramatically increase . Obviously , the cost increases with the size and complexity of such preventive engineering . It is theoretically impossible to build a flood control project along the Mississippi to prevent all possible floods . The same is true if attempting to eliminate any possible ozone exposure episodes in a future year similar to 1988 It is not possible to reduce existing emissions to a point where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ozone standard in another year exactly like 1988 . <p> Our National Ambient Air Quality Standard ( NAAQS ) for ozone actually accounts for the year to year variation in the influence of meteorology on smog formation by allowing for one " exceedance " Of the standard per year on the average . This means that we could go nine years without an exceedance of a standard and be legally within the standard even if there were 10 exceedances during the 10th year . <p> At present , however , the EPA specifies that only three years can be used to evaluate attainment and nonattainment of the ozone standard , regardless of meteorological influence , good or bad . ( Over a three-year period , an area must not surpass the standard on more than three days . ) This constraint is statistically inconsistent with the intent of the NAAQS and is what led to the latest emissions-testing regulations that the EPA proposed and got incorporated into the Clean Air Act because of 1988 . The Agency did nothing , incidentally , to inform the Congress about the anomalous nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( See " How Clean is the Air We Breathe ? " CR , March 1990 . ) <p> Good News on Smog <p> Four years have now passed since 1988 and a whole different ozone air-quality picture for the nation has emerged . Even without adjusting for weather , the official pollution-monitoring data show that fully 63 urban areas listed by the EPA as requiring emissions testing presently meet federal ozone standards ( using the EPA 's own threeyear criterion for classification . ) And a number of major urban areas that still surpass the standards have significantly less of a smog problem than suggested by the current regulations . <p> The table on page 17 shows how the number of nonattainment areas and the severity of the smog problem have decreased . California is not included in the table because the state has a lower ozone standard than the rest of the nation and because the Los Angeles basin-where most of the state 's as well as the nation 's smog pollution occurs-is uniquely different from the rest the country . The two key conclusions that can be drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas that should be currently designated as nonattainment , down from 89 when 1988 data were included . Except for Houston , there are no areas which are truly classifiable as " severe " or " serious . " <p> It is the severe and serious areas and the whole Northeast that require the implementation of the more stringent I/M program recently proposed by the EPA . If properly classified , these areas should not be required to implement enhanced auto I/M ( see box , page 16 ) . Further , unless an urban area is in nonattainment , I/M in any form is not necessary and should be eliminated . According to the current state of air quality , only 26 urban areas ( outside of California ) should be subjected to these programs . <p> The trends in urban ozone have decreased dramatically over the past decade and should continue to decline . ( See graph , page 18 . ) The anticipated auto emissions reductions associated with the normal turnover of the auto fleet to post-1980 technology will more than likely bring these and all remaining areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Stuck with Problem Tests <p> Despite the new information , the EPA has been very reluctant to tell the public the good news . Only in October of this year did the Agency report air-quality data using the years 1989 , 1990 , and 1991 , which showed significantly lower smog levels than those portrayed when the anomalous 1988 data were used . ( By comparison , it released the data set using the 1986 , 1987 , and 1988 data in early 1989  --  in time to lock the current listings into the Clean Air Act . This author has since released the air-quality data through the relevant months of 1992 . ) <p> Even as the new information comes out , it will be extremely difficult for states to get areas redesignated or reclassified to avoid unnecessary pollution controls . Current regulations do not , in fact , provide for the down-classifying of areas based on the more recent data . <p> Beyond the fact that they wo n't be necessary in most cases , the emissions tests proposed by the EPA present significant problems for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September report by the U.S. General Accounting Office ( GAO ) found a number of problems in the EPA 's " enhanced " I/M program . <p> According to the report , for example , 28% of vehicles tested using the enhanced I/M " testing procedure failed an initial emissions test but passed a second emissions test , even though no repairs were made to the vehicles . " <p> " These results , " the report concludes , " raise questions about whether the ... test procedure is reliable in identifying out-of-compliance vehicles and whether inaccurate identification of emission problems could result in unnecessary repairs . <p> " Vehicles that fail the test may also be more difficult to repair because of trouble in diagnosing the cause of emission problems , mechanics ' not being trained in emission repairs for high-technology vehicles , and the inability of repair shops to afford the enhanced test equipment to replicate emission tests and determine if repairs were effective . These drawbacks could cause frustration for motorists who could be required to make repeated trips to have their vehicles tested , repaired , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional or unnecessary repairs . " <p> ( It is interesting to note that the EPA failed to comment on these concerns , as requested . ) <p> There are also serious questions about the cost-effectiveness of the existing emissions test programs . These programs call for annual or biennial tests for cars made after about 1968 . Older cars ( 1980 and prior ) , according to emissions testing and vehicle registration statistics , are responsible for most of the on-the-road emissions of hydrocarbons , the principal chemical precursor to ozone . <p> There is significant evidence , however , that pre-1980 and in particular , pre-1975 vehicles are not being driven during the commute hours . The morning commute-related emissions cause the peak ozone levels in the afternoon , downwind of our major urban areas . Further , only about 5% of the post-1980 vehicles  --  which are equipped with highly reliable emissions-control systems  --  fail their current inspections . Given these facts , why burden the other 95% of car owners with the cost of testing and personal inconvenience ? <p> A far cheaper and more effective approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stedman of the University of Denver , for example . These devices can detect and identify the cars that emit high levels of pollutants , if reductions are needed in an area , without burdening the vast majority of motorists with time-consuming emissions cheeks , which cost up to $35 per inspection . A program based on his technology would cost less than $2.50 per car owner . ( See , " A Better Way To Catch Polluting Cars , " CR , June 1992 . ) <p> The I/M program as it stands has financial impact on those who do n't contribute to the actual air pollution problem and on those who can least afford repairs if their car fails the emissions test . If a driver fails the I/M test , he is required to spend up to $150 on repairs , whether or not he passes the test after repair . Under the enhanced I/M program , this cost will be as high as $450 . Considering problems raised by the GAO , such expense could become widespread . Again , use of alternative technology would be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually contributing to air pollution . <p> Stedman , who has conducted extensive monitoring in the field , has shown in fact that the current I/M program does not reduce hydrocarbon emissions and only marginally reduces carbon monoxide emissions . Therefore , we should not only question how current I/M programs could be more cost effective , but why they are needed at all . <p> Be Wary of Assertions <p> Finally , the EPA 's assertions that the benefits of enhanced I/M are needed to achieve and maintain our airquality goals must be scrutinized very carefully . The agency claims , for example , that the program " will reduce hydrcarbon emissions , which cause ozone formation , by 28% . " What does a 28% hydrocarbon reduction really mean ? <p> This refers to the difference between the expected average emissions of the total population of cars on the road in the year 2005 with and without enhanced I/M . Unfortunately , this is far from the true benefit of these programs . What we are concerned about is the change in total hydrocarbon emissions between now and 2005 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban population and the like , would show that the true benefits would be no more than 5% between now and the year 2005 . <p> Given the fact that the trends associated with existing control strategies show cities will meet federal standards long before 2005 , it should be clear that I/M is both unnecessary and of small benefit . <p> What is the message for the consumer as a result of this discussion ? <p> Quite simply , make sure that your local air pollution control agency is implementing only needed emissions control programs . Few areas need any additional controls . Do n't let these agencies tell you otherwise . Ozone and carbon monoxide levels have dropped dramatically everywhere in the nation . Almost every urban area , outside of California , is close to achieving our health standards , with the possible exception of Houston . <p> Emissions from the car population as a whole will continue to decline over the next 10 to 15 years as older cars leave the fleet . If emissions-testing programs are expanded to larger populations or escalated in complexity and cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings regarding the need for such programs . <p> Above all , do n't accept the excuse that " the EPA is making us do it . " Tens of billions of dollars , as well as personal time and frustration , are at stake . <p> <p> Do you live here ? <p> The following urban areas must institute the EPA 's proposed enhanced emissions tests . According to recent air-quality data , however , these areas no longer have smog pollution problems severe enough to justify the programs .
