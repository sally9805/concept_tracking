Phil Anderson wiped the thin layer of sweat from his face with a white handkerchief and looked again out the window from inside the dark of the store . His father-in-law , whom he always called Mr. Wilkie , sat beside him in a cane-bottom chair . Phil had only one lamp burning in the back , and , while the front windows usually let in a good deal of light , the day was now overcast . At first he had not lighted more lamps simply because he did n't want the store any hotter than it already was , but now , even though it had grown darker , Dock was out there , striding up and down the street with his face turned toward the store and fixed in a hot stare , and Phil had n't thought any more about how dim it had grown inside . He mostly kept his gaze trained on Dock , as did Mr. Wilkie , who he knew had good reason for concern . <p> Phil thought that Dock , because of the way he paced back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a soldier who was perhaps being punished for an infraction-made to continue his marching until he dropped hot and almost dead in the June heat . He supposed it was also the pistol in the small holster on Dock 's belt that gave him his sense of Dock as soldier , but seeing the pistol there was , of course , not unusual . <p> Upon closer look , though , it seemed to him that maybe Dock did n't really move like a soldier after all . His stride was a little too erratic . There was no measured , military snap in his step . He was pacing more like an angry child who is almost at the point of being told to go and cut his own switch , and no parent would put up with the language coming out of his mouth . <p> Mr. Wilkie leaned back in his chair and slowly took out his pipe , packed it with tobacco , and lit it after striking a match against the bottom of his shoe . " Are the cattle farmers having trouble with Bangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " No . Not right now , " Phil said without turning away from the window . <p> " That 's good . It can be tough on a small farmer . " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> While he spoke and kept watch , Phil somehow continued to eat his lunch of crackers , cheese , and bologna , washing it down with swallows of water from the jar at his feet . <p> " Reckon what cotton might bring this fall ? " Mr. Wilkie asked . " No telling . " <p> " Still , it looks like a lot of people have planted . They have n't lost faith . <p> " No , sir . " <p> The louder and more violent Dock 's language became , the softer Mr. Wilkie spoke . His voice was so quiet , so controlled , that if Phil had not known better , it would have seemed to him as if their discussion of local agriculture were taking place in church on the back pew during the middle of a sermon , Dock 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of hell 's fire . But at the end of Dock 's tirade , he knew that there would be no final prayer , no gift of redemption offered . <p> Mr. Wilkie had stepped off the Birmingham train and onto the platform at three o'clock sharp the day before . Phil had taken his hand in a firm and hardy shake and looked him squarely in the eye , and the well-dressed gentleman had responded in like manner , as always . After Phil had retrieved the one bag , Mr. Wilkie asked after family members , especially Phil 's father , Rafe . Even though there was some age difference between them-Phil 's father being olderthe two men were close . They shared a passion for horses . Rafe had served in the cavalry during the War , and Mr. Wilkie , in his younger days , had worked at breaking horses in Arkansas and Texas . <p> Phil listened to the gravel crunch under their feet as they walked . " We have a new preacher at church , " he said , just remembering . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll come to Sunday service with us . " <p> " Yes , I 'd like that , " Mr. Wilkie said . " That sounds fine . " <p> Phil inquired then how things were in the shoe business . <p> When they reached the end of the depot road where it ran into the main street through town , Phil asked if he would like to come up and stay at the store for a while or go on to the house . <p> " I have a little business to tend to , " Mr. Wilkie said . <p> He had known early on , when his father-in-law began making so many trips down , that it was probably a woman , and a much younger one at that , since Mr. Wilkie had been quiet about it . He was glad for the gentleman . After all , Mr. Wilkie had been a widower for many years , and if a somewhat older man could find companionship , what could be wrong with it ? Besides , he 'd thought at the time , Mr. Wilkie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But later , when he heard the rumor that Dock might not be the father of the twins his wife had recently lost in childbirth-he could only shake his head . It was just a rumor , but he understood how things were between Dock and his wife , that Dock did not always treat her right . He knew that sometimes she could not leave the house and allow herself to be seen in public . And he knew what a gentle man his father-in-law was . <p> Mr. Wilkie was late for supper that night . <p> " What 's keeping Papa ? " Louise said at the table . " And did n't I tell you he 'd be late ? " She looked at Phil in aggravation . <p> " Yes , and you were right . " <p> They heard his footsteps then . Phil made ready to rise , and his father pushed back his own chair and wiped his mouth and neatly clipped white goatee with his napkin . <p> After supper , the three men went and sat in the living room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk was mostly between the two older men . " My youngest son seems to do all right for himself , " Rafe had said . " Some fine horses , a fine business , and a fine wife . Not necessarily in that order , of course . " The men laughed , but Mr. Wilkie seemed distracted . <p> At the evening 's end , when they stood out on the long porch , Rafe took Mr. Wilkie by the arm . " You 'll come to church with us on Sunday , wo n't you ? We 've got a find preacher . Only been here a few weeks . You must hear him . " <p> " I 've already told him , Daddy . He says he 'll come . " <p> " Good , good , " the father said . The old man started down the steps , then turned back for a moment . " Too bad Dock could n't have been here tonight , " he said . " He 's got that wife to look after , though . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silent . Phil watched his father turn and descend the steps and walk out into the humid night . <p> Dock was closer now to the store . He walked just past the high wooden porch , quiet for the moment . <p> Phil swallowed another bite of bologna and hoop cheese . He 'd drunk the last of his water , but his mouth was still filled with a greasy taste . It was in his throat , too . <p> " What time your train leave tomorrow ? " he said . <p> " One-fifteen . " <p> Phil heard Dock couch hard and spit on the ground . " I 'm sure Louise will put out quite a spread for dinner before you leave . " He laughed slightly , as if to say , " There 's nothing wrong here . " <p> Then Dock 's voice came again , louder , even more violent . <p> " You say the shoe business has been good lately ? " <p> " Not as good as it could be , but then it never is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a thin stream of sweet and fragrant smoke that smelled like dried apples . <p> " No sir . " Phil shook his head , got up , and walked back into the dark part of the store where he poured more water for himself from a jug behind the counter . He swallowed it in several mouthfuls , but the warm water could n't quite cut through the greasy taste that enveloped his throat . This is senseless , he thought . Why does n't Dock just get it over with ? <p> Phil looked out front as two young black boys in a wagon filled with sacks of feed rolled past . He recognized one of them as Jeremiah , who often came in the store . They moved slowly at first , but after seeing and hearing Dock , they quickened their team . The only other person Phil could see stood in the doorway of a store across the street . It was a white man . He could n't tell who . <p> Things had n't been like this when his father had come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl Teclaw had donehow Teclaw had met him in the road , slightly drunk , the both of them on horseback , and how Teclaw had cussed him , called him a tired old man , and told him to get out of his damn way . " I may be too old to take care of you , Carl , " he had said , " but I 'll send one of my boys around . You can count on that . " <p> Dock had been furious . " The son of a bitch , " he said . " I 'm going to kill him . " <p> Phil stepped slowly in front of the door . " No . If he 's got to be killed , I 'll do it . You 're not going to walk in and commit murder , that would n't be right . " <p> " Phil is right , " the old man said , and with that , the matter was settled , as it always was when their father spoke . <p> Phil then picked up his .38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the safety device was built into the handle , and he and Dock walked together across the street and into Teclaw 's store . <p> " Carl , you 've got a pistol here , " Phil said . It was more a declaration than a question . <p> Phil had then taken his white handkerchief from his pocket and let it fall open . " I 'll hold one end at arms length with my right hand . Carl , you hold the other end , " he said , describing the way his father had told him duels used to be fought . " Dock will count three and we 'll each drop our ends , draw our pistols , and fire . " <p> Teclaw looked down at his feet . " I 've got a wife and children . I ca n't go outside with you . " <p> " I 've got a wife at home myself , and a baby boy . Now come on . This has got to be done . " <p> " If I got down on my knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " All right , Carl , " he 'd said . " That will satisfy me . " He 'd hoped then that Dock would n't come back later and kill the man on his way home . Their father had taught them better than that , but Dock might do anything . <p> He knew the shotgun was there behind the counter , not far from where he stood now with the water jug . It was always there , the .12 gauge double-barrel , up on the wall , well-oiled , loaded with buckshot . His father had given it to him a few years before , at Christmas of ' 06 , if he remembered right . It had kept coming into his mind when he 'd been up front with his father-in-law . He did not even have to turn around and look for it in the dim light . He knew exactly where it was , all he had to do was take one step backward and reach . His hand would find it . <p> He looked up front at Mr. Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he touched the panes with his fingertips and gently tapped the glass . It was as if he were offering himself as a target , saying , " Go ahead , shoot me through this window . " Phil wanted to tell him that he ought to step back . To dare Dock was about as foolish a thing as a man could ever do . <p> Dock 's language was getting worse . Bastard . Son of a bitch . These were the words coming out of him now , and if there had ever been a chance that nothing would happen , that Dock would walk away , which was n't the case , that time had now passed . Mr. Wilkie could not allow it . <p> Phil stepped away from the counter and toward the back wall . There was no question . None at all . And as he told himself this and reached back for the shotgun , he heard Dock 's voice for a moment , not the shouts that were pouring through the open door , but Dock saying , " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his sides . And he , Phil , seven years old , had stood behind his older brother feeling the weight of guilt as they both faced their angry father . " I let your horse out of the barn when you told us not to ever go near him , " Henry had said-he was still Henry then , had not yet become Dock . He had not even added that it was an accident . He 'd just said , " I did it , " covering for his younger brother . <p> Phil picked the shotgun up by the stock , being careful not to get fingerprints on the oiled barrel . He broke open the breach . There was no need to . He knew it was loaded , but he checked anyway , for Mr. Willie 's sake . He snapped it shut and the metal pieces rang against each other . He knew Mr. Willie heard and that the man could not mistake the sound , but he did n't act as if he 'd heard , did not turn his head toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil walked then into the stronger light in the front and stood again beside his father-in-law . He leaned down and propped the shotgun beside the window . " If you need it , use it . " That was all he said . There was no more talk of diseased cattle or of cotton . <p> He sat down and then watched as Dock suddenly turned , his eyes squinted , his head tilted . Dock reached for and pulled the pistol from his belt . Mr. Wilkie , in one easy upward and unbroken motion had stood and stepped out the door ; he raised the shotgun now as if he were throwing down on a rabbit-a cane-cutter out in the river swamp , maybe . The explosion rang through the store and the smell of sulfur , like sickness , followed . His brother 's body was already on the ground . He did not even see it fall . It was just there , sprawled and twisted , Dock 's head a red and torn mess . Dirt crusted to his wounds , to his blood-soaked hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pistol , then walked out onto the porch . Mr. Wilkie stood over the body . A crowd of people had gathered , black and white , the blacks standing farther back . Phil made certain that the crowd saw him there on the porch , saw the pistol in his hand . <p> Mr. Wilkie looked around at the crowd . He held the shotgun in his right hand , the barrel angled toward the ground . " Has anybody got anything to say about this ? " he said . No one spoke or looked at him . <p> " Good . I 've got to get back to my business in Birmingham . " <p> Phil watched as his father-in-law walked away with the shotgun . He did n't know if Mr. Wilkie would try to leave that night or the next morning , or if he would go and talk with the sheriff . But he was sure of one thing , his father-in-law would face the old man before he left . <p> He would say , " I 'm sorry . I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store , found a cloth sack , and took it outside . People were still gathered around the body , and he walked between them and spread the sack over his brother 's face , making sure that it also covered the thick dark pool beside his head . He stood there then , looking down at the body that had grown solid in the middle . When did that happen ? he wondered . When did he become so heavy-set ? He was no longer aware of the people around him . For a moment he could not think what to do next , and in that instant felt like a boy bewildered by the strange and unfathomable ways of things that a father tries to make him understand . <p> He began walking toward the old house where he and Henry had grown up . As soon as he made the turn in the road , he would see it . The wide porch , the dog trot . He walked slowly . The sun had come out again and sweat ran down his face . It ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its salt on his tongue . At the turn , he stopped , stepped down into the shallow ditch beside the road , and bent over , holding one hand against his stomach . His throat burned , and he waited on what he 'd eaten . Afterward , he took out his white handkerchief and cleaned the corners of his mouth ; he stepped then out of the ditch and continued . <p> The funeral ca n't be tomorrow , he thought . There would be regular Sunday service . He and Louise would go , of course , unless he was needed to sit with the body . And besides , tomorrow would be too soon for a funeral . Family had to be notified . <p> He was almost to the house now , walking slowly , but steadily . He could see his father sitting in a chair just inside the dog trot ; then the old man rose . He knew his father had heard the shot , that he might even somehow know what had happened . But he would have to tell him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun . " He had no fear of what his father would say . The old man would understand . He had done what he knew was right , what his father had taught him . <p> He approached the steps , his throat still burning . <p>
