As the giant 200-inch Hale telescope began probing the depths of the universe , a more prosaic observing program was swinging into action a short distance away . At the 18-inch Schmidt camera , Henry Holt and David Levy were busily preparing circular films to photograph a swath of the sky in search of asteroids . The night was June 22 , 1990 . They were about to make a discovery that would change our understanding of the solar system . The targets of their photographic search were elusive near-Earth asteroids , objects that cross Earth 's orbit and move so quickly that astronomers suspect many come and go without ever being noticed . But many of the search team 's photographs routinely reveal other asteroids . Some orbit in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter . Occasionally , the hunters nab asteroids farther out in space , ones that circle the Sun in the same orbit as Jupiter . These asteroids keep pace with the giant planet and group into two clouds  --  one ahead of Jupiter and one following it . Together , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are asteroids held captive by Jupiter 's gravity . Each asteroid  --  whether it be main-belt , Earth-crosser , or Jupiter Trojan  --  has its own characteristic motion on photographic film . The asteroid Holt and Levy found that night had a motion unlike those of any of the three classes of asteroids . Its motion indicated an unusual orbit for an asteroid ; it was the same as the orbit of Mars . The first Mars Trojan had been found . " A few weeks later I was outside with my mother , " relates Levy . " We were looking at Mars , noting its beauty . I asked off the cuff if she knew how many objects share that orbit . She said three , Mars and its two moons . I said four  --  now there 's a Mars Trojan . For a planet that we know so well , that gave me a neat feeling . " Eureka ! The 1990 discovery of a Mars Trojan was so startling that the world 's foremost asteroid experts could scarcely believe it . For Brian Marsden , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discovery of the Mars Trojan was " a bit of a shock . " The discovery came as part of a methodical Mars-and Earth-crossing asteroid and comet survey being conducted under the direction of Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker . On that night in June 1990 , Holt and Levy exposed about 30 films , each for 8 minutes . The following day Levy noticed a faint object , about 17th magnitude , on a pair of films . This sparked his interest , as it appeared to be moving faster and at a different angle than asteroids normally move . They photographed it again that night , confident in having found a new asteroid . The first to recognize it as a Mars Trojan was Edward Bowell of Lowell Observatory . " It hit me right away , " said Bowell , " but Brian Marsden , being a cautious soul , would n't believe me . " The asteroid was given the provisional designation 1990 MB , and although it will not receive a permanent number or name until it is observed again this year , it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mars Trojan prompted astronomers to re-examine what we know about Trojan asteroids . Astronomers discovered the first member of this exclusive family in 1906 . The new asteroid shared Jupiter 's orbit and was given the name Achilles . A few months later , astronomers found a second asteroid traveling along with Jupiter . This one received the name Patroclus . ( The men after whom the asteroids were named were heroes of the Trojan War of about 1400 B.C. between Troy and the Greek states . ) With the precedent set , astronomers adopted the custom of referring to asteroids in Jupiter 's orbit as Trojans and naming all Jupiter Trojans after other heroes of the legendary battle for Troy . Credit for much of our knowledge about Jupiter 's Trojans goes to Eugene Shoemaker . He began a systematic search for Trojans with Palomar 's 18-inch Schmidt in 1985 and renewed the search in 1988 . So far , he and his search team have bagged 45 Trojans . Altogether , astronomers have identified 300 Trojans . But that is only the tip of the Trojan iceberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometers in diameter . To put that figure in perspective , it is nearly half the currently numbered population of the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter . WANDERING HEROES Trojan asteroids cluster about two points in the orbit of a planet called Lagrangian points ( for the 18th-century French mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange who first worked out their significance ) . One of the Lagrangian points , called L4 , sits 60deg ahead of a planet . The other , L5 , sits 60deg behind the planet . Objects at these points become trapped by the combined gravitational tugs of the nearby planet and the Sun . Trojans circle the Sun in stable but unusual orbits . A Trojan does n't stay at either the L4 or L5 point but instead oscillates around it , moving back and forth along the planet 's orbit . Trojans follow a teardrop-shaped path that in the case of Jupiter 's Trojans extends for about 40deg along the Jovian orbit . Trojans can be found anywhere along this zone and , in fact , are rarely found at the L4 or L5 points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There may be Trojans in enormous horseshoe-shaped orbits that extend up to 300deg away from Jupiter , allowing Trojans associated with one Lagrangian point to move most of the way around the Sun to the other L point . When the Mars Trojan was found , theoreticians scrambled for answers . What type of orbit was it in ? How long had it been there ? And why did n't we find it sooner ? Kim Innanen of Canada 's York University , an expert on orbital dynamics , has some of the answers . Innanen suggests the Mars Trojan was not found sooner because calculations of where to look predicted a faint object far away from the Lagrangian point , making attempts to pin down its location very difficult . As Innanen puts it , " A back-of-the-envelope calculation discourages anyone from searching , which only goes to prove that one should not be discouraged by learned celestial mechanicians who have not looked ! " Like the Jupiter Trojans , the Mars Trojan does not stay the same distance from its captor planet . It cycles along a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distance so long that the little asteroid takes 1,000 years to make a complete circuit . It is as if Eureka is on a leash  --  Mars lets its pet Trojan stray only so far before bringing it home , closer to the L5 point . " A central question , " says Innanen , " is how long the Mars Trojan has been there . " Astronomers can use computers to simulate the evolution of orbits . But as Innanen explains , " Calculations longer than a few million years for the inner solar system are painful  --  it brings computers to their knees . We 're just going to have to wait for the next generation of computers . " What we are sure of is that the Mars Trojan is about 3 kilometers in diameter and in a very stable orbit . However , Shoemaker believes the asteroid is too small to have survived in its present state from the origin of the solar system some 4.5 billion years ago . " I believe it was captured at some time rather recently , that is , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery of an asteroid in the orbit of Mars prompts the question of how many other planets have retinues of Trojans . One school of thought says that the stable regions in the orbits of the outer planets Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune are so small that the chance of any objects ' existing in those areas is very slight . But Innanen is not so sure . " In terms of our understanding , it is still the early days for Uranus and Neptune . They certainly have stable regions at the Lagrangian points . Our simulations also suggest it is well worth searching for Saturn Trojans in horseshoe orbits . " The problem with finding Saturn Trojans is that they will be faint and the gravitational effects of Jupiter make it difficult to predict where they are in the sky . But other Trojans could exist closer to home . As Marsden concedes , " If Mars has some , Earth is quite likely to have them , too . Quite a lot of objects come into Earth 's proximity . " People have long speculated about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pluto , conducted a search for small natural Earth satellites in the 1950s . Scott Dunbar did a photographic search with the 48-inch Schmidt from 1978 to ' ' 82 , and in 1981 and ' ' 82 Francisco Valdes and Robert Freitas used the 24-inch Burrell Schmidt on Kitt Peak in Arizona to look for objects near Earth 's Lagrangian points . None were seen . Eleanor Helin , who found a pre-discovery image of the Mars Trojan on a photograph she took in 1979 , believes that establishing the existence of Earth Trojans " would be a very significant discovery . It would be far more important than other asteroid discoveries , because it relates to our planet . Such objects may have been held there over the eons . It would be quite a revelation . " SEEKING THE HOLY GRAIL Much of the current interest in Trojan asteroids comes because these objects could tell us a great deal about the origin and development of the solar system . Were they objects that simply wandered into the spider 's web of gravity spun by the planets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an eternal embrace with their bigger siblings ? Determining what the Trojans are made of could tell us the answers . The first step in determining an asteroid 's composition is figuring out how reflective it is . Many of the known Trojans are good-sized objects , typically 100 km across . But most of these appear faint from Earth , usually dimmer than magnitude 15 . This suggests they are dark . They reflect only 5 percent of the sunlight that hits them , making them dark as charcoal , a characteristic shared by other objects in the outer solar system : the rings of Uranus , the small moons of Uranus and Neptune , part of the surface of Saturn 's moon Iapetus , and inactive comets ( ones not currently ejecting gas and dust ) . The dark nature of the Trojans is one reason Shoemaker has proposed that the Trojans are n't rocky asteroids at all . Virtually all of them , he suggests , are made of the same stuff as comets . " Trojans are identical in origin with Oort cloud comets . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shoemaker estimates that the present population of Trojans came from a much larger collection of planetesimals , as much as 60 Earthmasses ' worth , that formed 4.6 billion years ago in the region between present-day Jupiter and Saturn . Today , Jupiter orbits 5.2 astronomical units from the Sun and Saturn orbits at a distance of 9.5 AU. ( 1 AU is the average distance from Earth to the Sun . ) But in the early days of planet formation , the proto-Jupiter may have started out as far as 8 AU from the Sun . It swept up material from a zone that extended inward to 5 AU and outward to 9 AU . About 10 Earth masses of this early material came together to form the rocky core of Jupiter . The gravity of the proto-Jupiter flung most of the other planetesimals under its control out of the solar system . But Jupiter 's gravity captured a small percentage and , after subjecting them to a series of close encounters with Jupiter , trapped these planetesimals at the L4 and L5 points . " The Trojans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we can determine the efficiency of the process that captured the Trojans , we can work back in time to what the planetesimal swarm was to begin with . It is a search for where the planets came from . That is the Holy Grail . " Astronomers are particularly inspired by the prospect that Trojans may be pristine remnants of the early solar system . Once locked into their orbits , oscillating about the Lagrangian points , Trojans would have been exposed to fewer collisions than their counterparts in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter . The few collisions between Trojans that did occur would have happened at relatively slow speeds , so slow that colliding Trojans might not have shattered but instead stuck together . Astronomers William Hartmann and Dale Cruikshank think they have found just such a strange asteroid . Called 624 Hektor , it is the largest of the Jupiter Trojans . Observations of its fluctuating brightness point to an asteroid that is dumbbell-shaped and rotating every 6.9 hours . It may , in fact , be the product of two asteroids ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asteroids , and eruptions of gas and dust have reshaped active comets , the surfaces of the Trojans have likely gone unchanged for billions of years . The lack of shattering collisions in the haven of the Lagrangian points means that Trojan asteroids , whether tied to Jupiter , Mars , or another planet , may be one of the few fossils we can find from the days before the planets formed . A close look at a Trojan asteroid might indeed be a glimpse of the Holy Grail of the solar system . Clifford J. Cunningham has been engaged in photometric studies of asteroids since 1980 . He is author of the 1988 book Introduction to Asteroids published by Willmann-Bell , Inc . <p>                     @x In a phase one study of young college students ( the product of the teacher-librarian 's information literacy efforts in the K-12 arena ) , Alison Head and Michael Eisenberg ( 2009 ) asked what problems these young adults faced in doing research assignments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly ; but notice the familiar problems students are having on the front end before they get into the reading , synthesis , and writing process . <p> L : Course-Related Concerns  --  Information overload ( e.g. , the more you know ; the less you know ; it is depressing ) . <p>  --  Too much irrelevant information ; can not locate what is needed from online results . <p>  --  Beginning and getting started on an assignment . <p>  --  Trying to find the " perfect source .

They also find that students appreciate academic librarians who help with their search at the moment of need but not when taught a " course " or workshop in library research . <p> Consider the following issues as teacher-librarians try to raise/develop a new generation of students really prepared for college research : <p>  --  The overwhelming nature of the information world . We argue that children and teens need to learn strategies to come into command of and build their own information spaces that are much smaller than the juggernaut of the whole Internet ( Williams &; Loertscher , 2007 ) . While you are reading , also check out page 50 of Redesigning Literacy 2.0. for David Warlick 's warning to teacher-librarians ( Warlick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw open the topic of student research . We argue that any instructor who allows students to tackle " any topic you are interested in " invites plagiarism but also introduces much confusion . Generating a major umbrella question with students doing various subtopics either as groups or individuals under the umbrella is much more likely to result in a smooth beginning and focused inquiry . It also allows for a major analysis across student research projects at the end as a whole-class magnificent " so what " activity ( Loertscher , Koechlin , &; Zwaan , 2007 ) . <p>  --  The tendency of instructors to create an assignment and just wait for the products to be handed in for grading . We argue that in the evolutions of libraries into learning commons , assignments should become conversations among instructors , teacher-librarians , subject specialists , and even parents ( Loertscher , Koechlin , Zwaan , 2008 ) . <p>  --  Courses or workshops in " library . " We argue that just in time instruction about the research process is far superior to teaching a curriculum of library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach a course . Hundreds of articles in the professional literature have argued this point over several decades without a massive change in the behavior of professionals in the field . The best current statement of integration and collaboration is found in one of the latest works by Allison Zmuda and Violet H. Harada ( 2008 ) . <p>  --  The front-end elephant of finding and locating the right amount of high quality information . We argue that the front-end mechanics are and should be subservient to the really important part of inquiry and learning . The reading and digesting of what is found , the analysis of the information gathered , the communication of new knowledge , and most important , engaging in a major " so what " activity across all the research projects done by students constitutes the central elements of effective inquiry . Thus , in a collaborative effort , classroom teachers and teacher-librarians plan inquiry so that the bulk of time spent is NOT on topic development and finding information ( Loertscher , Koechlin , &; Zwaan , 2007 ) . <p> More and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional . The traditional emphasis on finding and locating needs to be re-examined as we assist learners in getting over the first barrier of inquiry and into the fascinating world of higher-level thinking about the content . When as a profession we concentrate only on front-end skills , we never push into the center of teaching and learning . Perhaps that is why general education writers and thinkers rarely consider our contribution as essential . <p> L : REFERENCES  --  Head , A. J. &; Eisenberg , M. B. ( 2009 ) .
