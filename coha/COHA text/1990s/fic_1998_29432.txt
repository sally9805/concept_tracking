Follow That Dream No contest for my husband , " Ruth said . " Reed 's all-time favorite scene is the cowboys farting around the campfire in Blazing Saddles . " I laughed . Side by side across my bed , Ruth and I were mourning the death and dearth of Great Cathartic Scenes in Recent American Cinema , but had gotten derailed in predicting our husbands ' hypothetical picks . " Scotty 's would have to be ... " I mused , tapping my fingers against my rib cage , " the Saint Crispin 's Day speech from Henry V. We few , we happy few . ' " " I know , I know , Larry Olivier waxing eloquently about holding his manhood dear . " Ruth rolled her eyes at me . They were raccoon-rimmed with brown shadow and feathery , erratic streaks of black where her daughter 's aim with the mascara wand had erred . My own four-year-old , Bethie , padded back to my side clutching bobbie pins and barrettes in her chubby fingers , as well as a baby hairbrush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she pressed against my scalp . " Or the universal default for most men , I 'd bet , " Ruth continued , " the hospital scene from Brian 's Song . " She lowered her voice , aiming for husky emotion but achieving only hilarious throaty gruffness . " I love Brian Piccolo . ' " " You are terrible . " I laughed . " Okay , where were we ? Kramer vs . Kramer . " " Close , but no cigar . Lacks that one wrencher scene . " " Not even in the courtroom ? " Sloan yanked at her mother 's hair . " You have a rat 's nest , Mommy , " she said . " Ouch ! " Ruth winced . We were lying across my wide queen-sized bed , though it was n't broad enough toprevent our legs from sticking awkwardly over at the side . Scotty was campaigning for a king mattress , but I was opposed , and cited Ruth as an ally . ( " God , " she 'd agreed , " they 're so vulgar-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The horizontal position of our bodies allowed our hair to fall conveniently over the edge of the bed so that Bethie and Sloan could comb and braid and part it , playing Beauty Parlor . It was a favorite game for all four of us , one we often resorted to on rainy afternoons . Even at their young age the girls were already savvy to the pointlessness of working puzzles or building wooden block villages : sooner or later the puzzles and blocks had to be knocked down , taken apart , and cleaned up . I do n't know where the boys were ; probably holding farting contests of their own . Both seven , my son , Jay , and Ruth 's Grayson were ripe for bathroom humor . The day before , giggling and thyroid-eyed with suppressed glee , they 'd summoned their younger sisters into the bathroom to witness a foot-long turd Jay had deposited in the toilet . They 'd gotten the disgusted reaction they 'd hoped for , and twenty-five minutes of punishment in time-out as well . " Summer of ' 42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hymie at the window when she reads the telegram . Oldie but goodie . Obscure but not forgotten . Steel Magnolias . " I frowned , but Ruth protested . " No fair disqualifying something just because it was n't a darling of the critics or does n't meet your superior literary standards . " " Okay , you include Kramer and I 'll let Magnolias pass . " " Hold still , Mommy , " Bethie commanded . Along with our hair styling came makeovers , compliments of eyeshadow , blush , and " lipcolor " department store freebies . The first time we 'd played Beauty Parlor , I stood up and greeted myself in the mirror : blue shadow high as my eyebrows , perfect circles of red on my cheeks , a lipsticked mouth in clown proportions . A dozen primary-colored plastic barrettes were clamped close to my scalp and forehead . " It 's worse than inadvertently catching sight of yourself in that mirrored strip above the meat bin at the supermarket , " Ruth had said . But Sloan and Bethie had been delighted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messes when the girls finished our " appointments , " but the game would have served its purposeentertainment for the children , relative peace for us . And Ruth and I were doing what we liked best too : talking . As I miss Ruth , I miss those afternoon sessions , the tender tiny fingers of our daughters , whose clumsy touch was as soothing and relaxing as any skillful masseuse 's . My hair was , is , thick and heavy , but never styled a result , I always claim , of having somehow missed that stage of adolescence when girls spend hours mirror-bound , figuring out how to use hot combs and round brushes and blow dryers to their best advantage . Versed in Gail Sheehy , Ruth always held that if you skip a stage in life you 'll have to return to it sooner or later , though I never asked her if the theory applied to grooming . I do own a hot comb , actually , stashed in the medicinal netherworld beneath the bathroom sink . The first time I tried to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked as though I had a hickey , and I was forced to wear a turtleneck to a no-excuses vestry function with Scotty even though it was April . " Mom , " Bethie complained . " I ca n't braid your hair . It 's not long enough . " I pointed to my navel . " I used to have hair down to here . " " No you did not , " Bethie countered with severe , run-on authority . " Get that tall green book from the bottom bookshelf in the den and I 'll prove it . " " Cheater , " Ruth said . Useless errands were another acknowledged time-wasting ploy . Bethie returned with the leather volume , fanning its black-and-white pages . Ruth rolled over . " What is this ? " " High school yearbook . " " Called Quair ' ? I 'm afraid to ask . " " Little book ' in Latin . " " Naturally . Why had n't I thought of that ? " I flipped through pictures of athletic teams and volunteer organizations until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Bethie , pointing to myself . My straight hair hung like a curtain to my waist . " Told you so . Nannie nannie boo boo . " " Is that you ? " Bethie squealed appreciatively . Ruth sidled next to her , ignoring Sloan 's indignant " I 'm not done yet ! " " Finished ' yet , " Ruth corrected . " Wow , " she said . " You did have some lengthy tresses . " " I was convinced that if I cut it , my personality would vanish too . It took me until my junior year in college to work up the nerve . And only then , I might add , because I was secure that Scotty sufficiently adored me to risk cutting off ten inches . " " And ? " " He did n't even notice . " Ruth ran her finger along the quotation beneath my name , reading aloud . " The quiet watcher , observer always , in solitary shaded shadows . ' Shaded shadows ? Did you make this up ? " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the yearbook editor 's idea of sensitive haiku . Summing me up in ten words or less . " " Ah , the soulful , sensitive seventies . But it 's not bad , " Ruth mused . " You are a watcher . " Still on my back , I peered closely at her , gauging my reaction to her statement , her judgment . " See ? " Ruth said gently , deflecting . " You 're at it again . Watching me . " She let pages drift through her fingers , stopping finally at a two-page spread on the Danish exchange student . " Looks like the alien Pia was spared the haiku dictum . She picked her own quote . Do n't you know that people change , thus relationships change , and that pain is a sign of changes , not endings ? ' " she read . " Turn back over , Mommy ! " Sloan yelled . " Please , " Ruth responded automatically . " Did n't you have yearbook quotes in the sixties ? " I asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incriminate me as a dork . " The girls tittered . At last , a conversation they could comprehend . Grimacing , Ruth confessed . " I am a part of all that I have met . ' " I howled . " Let me guess . You also had a poster on your wall that said , If you love something , let it go , and if it returns it is yours ' superimposed on a deserted beach . " " Actually , " Ruth said , " I had a poster illustrating all the positions for " she cut her eyes toward our juvenile hairstylists " intercourse , corresponding to each astrological sign . In black light neons . " A fresh torrent of rain pelted against the windowpane . She sat up . " God . The sun did not shine . It was too wet to play . ' " " I know , I know , " Bethie crowed . " Cat in the Hat . So we sat inside that cold cold wet day . ' Can we get a kitten , Mommy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth flopped back down and tapped a comb against my rib cage . " Now , where were we ? Splendor in the Grass . " " Funny Girl . " " Ordinary People . " " Camelot . When Guinevere is leaving for the nunnery , and her nose is running , and she says , Arthur , so many times I 've looked into your eyes and seen love there . ' " I sniffed sympathetically . " Prince of Tides . " " The King and I. " " He may not always be , ' " Ruth warbled , " what you would have him be , then all at once he 'll do , something wonderful . ' Do n't you say that line to yourself at least once every day ? " Sloan dropped an elastic to clap her hands over her ears . I laughed again . " Your turn , " Ruth said . I considered a minute . " Can we count made-for-TV movies ? " " Depends . " I whistled a tune inexpertly , and though I botched the haunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ruth said softly , and sighed . " Meggie . Poor Meggie . Poor Ralph . Poor Father deBricassart . Yes . That counts . " She cradled her head in her palm . " You know why we love The Thorn Birds , Pril ? I 'll tell you why we love it . Because it 's about yearning for and lusting after something you can never ever have . Denial . What a theme . Nobody gets the priest . The sperm but not the soul . " She sighed again . " Let 's do some subcategories . Cathartic superlatives . Saddest death . " I heard the refrigerator slam . Jay and Grayson , foraging for food less than an hour after lunch . " Hey , Mom ! " Grayson yelled upstairs . " I thought you were going to make meringues for us today ! " " Ca n't make meringues on rainy days ! " Ruth hollered back . " Why not ? " " They wo n't rise . " " Why ? " Ruth exhaled a noisy sigh . " Ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ! " we sang out on cue . Without missing a beat , she continued : " Out of Africa . " " Are you sure ? " " You got a sadder death ? " " Promise not to laugh . " Ruth widened her eyes and mouth in feigned innocence . " Have I ever laughed at you ? " " Love Story . " She giggled . " My . I do n't believe I'da tole that . Ali McGraw was wooden , but Pinocchio was a better actor . " " After I saw Love Story I bought a little knitted cloche so I could look like Jenny and have someone who looked like Ryan O'Neal fall in love with me . " I shook my head . " New category : biggest sob . And I know mine . " " Which ? " " Heard of Loew 's Grand Theater in Atlanta ? " " Sure . The premiere of Gone With the Wind . " " One afternoon in January while I was being paid to summarize depositions , I stood for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn to cinders . There was nothing firefighters could do . It was terrible , watching that grand old lady die . Such an ignoble demise . " I stared at the ceiling . " Scotty estimates that I 've spent one hundred twenty-six hours of my life watching Gone With the Wind . " I sensed Ruth 's smile beside me . " The next morning on the way to work , my bus passed what was left of Loew 's Grand , nothing but charred , cindery black stalks behind yellow police ribbons . The rubble was still smoking , with long icicles hanging from the charred beams where dripping water had frozen overnight . Then I threw up . " " On the bus ? " " Right there in the middle of the aisle . Scotty blamed it on the overheated bus , stinking of sausage biscuits , cheap perfume , and exhaust . I thought it was the sight of that pathetic , burned-out shell of a building . " I looked at Ruth . " But I was just pregnant . " " Just , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeshadow container before Ruth 's nose . " What 's the name of this color ? " Ruth squinted . " Innocent Blue . ' Geez . " " Geez , what ? " Sloan said , stroking the powder from her mother 's eye to temple . Ruth looked like a Cleopatra clone who had n't slept for a week . I fell silent , remembering my lingering melancholy for the vanished theater , and what it represented . Scotty had tried to understand my sorrow . And failed . Such attachment escaped him . The sound of bickering erupted from Jay 's room . He and Grayson were fighting over who deserved to be the Architect in a game of Life . " Now , that 's pathetic , " Ruth said . " Two seven-year-olds who already know which career card in Life produces the highest salary . Quiet ! " she barked . Sensing more interesting commotion down the hall , and nurturing a futile hope that the boys would let them join their game , Bethie and Sloan skittered from the bedroom . " Casablanca . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Afternoon , " Ruth suddenly said . " Oh , Audrey imploring Gary at the train station ! Every Audrey Hepburn movie . " " But we 've left out numero uno , the all-time weeper great . Or just saved it for last . " I watched her pull a skewed barrette from her hair , and knew . " The Way We Were . At the end , when Katie and Hubbel accidentally meet outside the Plaza . When she brushes Hubbel 's bangs out of his eyes , like she 'd done a thousand times before . Then . " Ruth shook her head . " No , no , no . It 's when Katie says , Would n't it be lovely to go back the way we were , when everything was easy ? ' And Hubbel says , Oh , Katie , it was never easy . ' " " No , no . It 's the scene when he says , You want too much ! ' and Katie says , Oh , but look at what I 've got . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hair . " You know what ? " Ruth said , her painted lips twisted in a rueful smile . " It 's the women we cry for in all those movies . Jenny and Katie and Meggie and Anna and the rest . Ever noticed ? The women , always the women . " She curved herself close and cozy and fetal , and pulled a small pillow beneath her head , a baby gift whose creweled linen pillow slip had n't looked crisp since the moment I 'd opened it . " Do you see the common thread in all these cathartic scenes ? " she asked me . " Do n't you see what happens in every one , Pril ? They 're all about departing . About leaving . About separating . Those are the stories that make us cry . They 're the only stories worth telling , or writing , or reading , or watching . Worth remembering . " We lay there , curled and stilled , until shrieks snatched us back . " Mommy ! Grayson put shredlocks on my Barbie ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " came Grayson 's withering reply . " Dreadlocks , dummy . " " He called me a dummy ! " And so Ruth and I , mothers , rose reluctantly to intervene and mediate . Behind us on the quilted white coverlet were left the faint impressions of our bodies , and smudges of Innocent Blue . It is laughable now , the Beauty Parlor game , our list of movies that dreary , rainy afternoon . Laughable and ludicrous that we cried or agonized over scenes and plots and characters meaningless beyond what they had once meant to us , during some bygone phase of our lives . But there 's another movie I 'll forever associate with Ruth , though not for its story . It fits her formula , consists almost entirely of departures and separations . But it 's a mere line of Dr. Zhivago that captures my intricate , indissoluble connection to Ruth . Whenever I think of movies , of the two of us together , and of Ruth now alone , that spare single line comes back to me : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
