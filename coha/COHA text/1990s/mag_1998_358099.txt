After finishing her sixth novel , Jazz , published in 1992 , Toni Morrison began casting about for the subject of her next book . Constant reading , a habit and passion she developed as a little girl , eventually led her to an obscure chapter in 19th century U.S. history , shortly after the Civil War : the westward emigration of former slaves into the sparsely settled territories of Oklahoma and beyond . Some found the promise of a new life in wide-open spaces , touted in numerous newspaper advertisements in the 1870s , irresistible , and a challenge besides . Morrison was struck by a caveat that often appeared in those ads : " Come Prepared or Not at All . " <P> As she began imagining how this historical material might generate a work of fiction , Morrison bumped into one of the banes of creative artists everywhere : the intrusion of the outside world into the space of private concentration . Drat the luck , in October 1993 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature . <P> " I was so happy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says of the beleaguered period following the announcement . " If I had n't , I would have thought , ' Uh-oh , can I ever write a novel again ? ' " At that moment , deluged by congratulations , invitations and preparations , never mind another novel , Morrison found herself stymied by her acceptance speech . She had no free time to work on it , and when she stole some , she produced nothing she liked . " I called someone at the Nobel Committee , " she remembers , " and I said , ' Look , if you 're going to keep giving prizes to women  --  and I hope you do  --  you 're going to have to give us more warning . Men can rent tuxedos . I have to get shoes , I have to get a dress . ' " <P> Her friend , the designer Bill Blass , rescued her , taking her into his fitting rooms and outfitting her for her appearance at the awards ceremony in Stockholm . More than four years later , Morrison still grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They had everything ; they had all these people around trying to make something work on me . On me . " <P> Morrison has learned since , of course , that the Nobel Prize carries burdens somewhat heavier than the problem of what to wear to the celebration . Although every writer drifts into daydreams of winning the prize , actually having it can produce some nightmarish side effects . A crushing mantle of gravitas descends on the winners . <P> People honored for making up stories or poems or plays are then expected to make pronouncements , in front of packed houses , on public issues . As an African-American woman , Morrison has faced such expectations constantly . " Most of the questions I get after readings or talks , " she says , " are anthropological or sociological or political . They are not about literary concerns . "
