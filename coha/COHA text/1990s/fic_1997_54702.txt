There is no obvious reason why it should have been necessary to distinguish him from Pope Clement VII ( who anyway died in 1534 ) , nor why he should have been confused with the poet Jacobus Papa in Ieper ( Ypres ) , who happened to have the same first name . ... <p>  --  Liner notes for Clemens non Papa : Missa Pastoresquidnam vidistis . The Tallis Scholars . Directed byPeter Phillips . Gimell Records , 1987 The undersigned , Jacobus Clemens , musician by profession , native of Ypres , and bound to that city by ties of kinship and affection , does solemnly attest and swear that he is not the pope . <p> What is the need for this statement ? As should be obvious to any unbiased observer , the pope is in Rome and I am in Ypres , which in itself should be enough to scotch any rumors about our alleged identity . It is an Ypres that looks suspiciously like Bruges , but never mind , it will do for our purposes . Yet here at the outset one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument . If Ypres and Bruges can become interchangeable in one 's mental landscape , as it seems to some degree they can , then why might not I , Jacobus Clemens , be interchangeable to a similar degree with His Holiness Pope Clement in the mental configurations of others ? Notice I said interchangeable with , not indistinguishable from . <p> Still , there seems to be a persistent tendency to blur the distinction between myself and the pope , and I am at a loss to account for it . To make the geographical point once again , I have never been to the Italian peninsula , much less to Rome itself , and so remote does it lie from my existence that even the fact of its being a peninsula I know only by hearsay . As far as I 'm concerned , it could be an island , or a continent unto itself , or even one of those vast , amorphous regions  --  flanked on sailing charts by sea monsters and dark-skinned demigods with feathers on their heads  --  that float about on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Am I being disingenuous ? After all , it is from this very peninsula , or whatever you wish to call it , that our part of the world is being flooded with unsound musical principles . Such is the opinion of our leading theologians and musical theorists , and though I do n't share this view in its entirety , I see its point . Undisciplined melody can have undesirable consequences not only for our honest and God-fearing craft but for society at large , and a little logic and symmetry have never done any harm . <p> Well ... that is not entirely true either . Whether or not I am Jacobus Clemens , musician of Ypres , is actually another matter , but it brings up the not unrelated question of whether I might possibly be Jacobus Papa , a so-called poet , likewise from Ypres . A substantial body of opinion holds that I am not , and of course I agree , though it would seem that a great deal of energy must be expended to separate me from this individual whom a perverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating . Willy-nilly , by accident or design , he has taken upon himself the role of my mirror image , my opposite number , my shadow if you like . It would be easy to dismiss him as a figment of the imagination did he not exist in his all too palpable and odious flesh . Let the record show that I do not deny his existence , however much he may try to deny minel Perhaps he is the one who should file an affidavit disavowing any identity with the pope . Were he to be arrested by the civil arm and interrogated under threat of torture by the ecclesiastical authorities on a charge of impersonating His Holiness , I would not lift a finger to save him . <p> You may well ask why this questionable personage should loom so large in my life . Had we grown up together as children in Ypres , shared or fought over the same toys , indulged in the same games and conspiracies that boys are prone to , coveted the same barmaid or servant wench , there might be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . I did not become even vaguely aware of him until much later , and I still find it hard to fix his features in my mind . Now I do not even remember if it was he who first sought me out or I him . Did he follow me to Bruges , or was he already here when I arrived ? I 'm afraid that by now it makes no difference . <p> But let us assume , for the sake of argument , that we have kept pace with each other from the beginning . That would mean that we were rivals as children whether we knew it or not , that there has always been a parallel between our respective professions , that the first slut I bedded , the poet Jacobus Papa was right there beside us . Even granting all that , there is still no reason for me to impersonate someone named Jacobus Papa , and conversely no need to go to the trouble of distinguishing myself from him . We may both be Jacobus , but we are hardly the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one were to set about drawing a line to separate each and every person from his possible namesake , the world 's business would never get done . Except that in this case the world insists I draw that line . For the likelihood remains that Jacobus Papa is bent on impersonating me , and that by usurping my identity he forces me to seek another . Well , it 's better to be mistaken for the pope than for him . <p> But there is a further distinction to be made when speaking of the pope : do we mean any pope or his particular Holiness , Pope Clement ? In other words , are we talking about the office or the man ? I stand by my statement that I am not the pope , but is the pope the pope ? Quite apart from the fact that Clement was once imprisoned , so they say , in the Castel Sant'Angelo by the forces of the emperor , during which time both the man and the office could be seen to have dwindled to insignificance , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be admitted that the last pope from these parts , who was , by the way , Pope Clement 's immediate predecessor , is accounted by all to have been a miserable failure . Born in Utrecht , chancellor of the University of Louvain , the emperor 's tutor for all the good it did either of them , and grand inquisitor  --  an impressive record , but to no avail . Every church dignitary of my acquaintance hangs his head sheepishly and changes the subject at the mere mention of Pope Adrian . No , Italians make the best popes , it is clearly something they do well , or if not well at least with a certain aplomb , so let us leave the office to them . <p> That is not to say that Pope Clement has n't had his bad days . It was surely no pleasure for him to be besieged by the emperor , and from the ramparts of his castle to watch Rome being despoiled by German soldiers . It was doubtless humiliating to have to flee to Orvieto by muleback , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must have been highly distasteful to have to intervene in the sordid marital relations of the king of England . And it was his ill luck that a comet should appear recently in the skies , causing excitable souls to call him the Antichrist . Personally I would not go that far , but the point is that no one would ever dream of applying the epithet to Pope Adrian . <p> No , there is no reason to envy Pope Clement , although , Heaven knows , there are perquisites that come with the post such as would never befall a poor working musician in Flanders . Not the least of these is a choir of some twenty or thirty voices , whose function it is to sing for His Holiness during meals ! I do n't mind saying that I would like that , provided they stayed on key . ( But I would not be surprised to discover that boor Jacobus Papa sitting down at the same table and beating time with his fork . ) I would even settle for the position of maestro di cappella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly have them perform one or two of my more ambitious masses  --  Pastores quidnam vidistis comes to mind  --  or , if I ever manage to complete them , some of my better motets , like Pater peccavi and Tribulationes civitatum . And I would have much less trouble finding a publisher for my Souterliedekens , my Little Psalter Songs  --  of that you can be sure . <p> Wondrous are the ways of the itinerant Flemish musician He starts his career as a choirboy in whom , because of his pure voice and impure habits , priests and maestri di cappella take an interest . He may be lured or bribed from one cathedral to another , or , if all methods of persuasion fail , kidnapped outright . ( Along the way he may even receive an encouraging word from the likes of Jacobus Papa . ) This traffic in choirboys extends throughout Europe : it is a question of supply and demand , and Flanders for the moment seems to have more than its share of the supply . If the lad is talented , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own music , and if he 's lucky may himself eventually become a maestro di cappella , in Italy or some other far-off place . He dies covered with honors at a ducal court , royal court , papal court , who knows ? It would be just like Jacobus Papa  --  who so far as I know is tone-deaf and has never written a single note of music in his life  --  to boast that he once caught the eye of the right choirmaster . I myself never did . <p> And if this talented lad is serious , he reads our very own Dr. Tinctoris , who lived for a long time in Naples and presumably died there . If he has the stamina , there are twelve monumental treatises for him to plow through , and there he finds everything he needs to know about modus , ternpus , and prolatio , solfisatio and deductio , mixtio tonorum and commixtio tonorum , cantus super librum and musica ficta , not to mention the divine riddles of counterpoint to be absorbed into his veins . Say what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like , but whatever else he was , he was not a crank . <p> Cranks and eccentrics abound these days . There is , for example , a certain Canon Copernicus in Poland , a place as remote and unimaginable as Italy if not more so , who says that the earth moves around the sun , or something like that . I have not read his famous book  --  nobody has , since it has not yet been published , but I 'm not sure that any of us would understand it if it had . And yet the ideas of this Polish visionary drift about in the air the way his planets are supposed to drift around the sun . Every church sexton or illiterate butcher 's boy seems to have heard a rumor of it and is not shy about expounding his own version . Indeed , it might be said that all these sextons and butchers ' boys , along with flocks of Lutherans and our own prelates , are themselves running around in circles , arguing , upholding , refuting , while I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to think if the very thought of it were not blasphemous . Such are the paradoxes forced on us by these disordered times . <p> For I take it as axiomatic that one must stand still to hear the music of the spheres . That ancient notion has been discredited by old Tinctoris , and I agree , I agree  --  but only up to a point . ( The soi-disant poet Jacobus Papa , who pretends to know everything about music , would no doubt agree entirely . ) It may have been the good doctor 's long residence in Naples that caused him to deny the existence of these harmonies , the terrestrial hubbub in that city being enough to drown out everything else . From what I hear of it , a less suitable place to listen for the music of the spheres would be hard to imagine . And yet , despite old Tinctotis and the Neapolitans , the idea lingers on , and this may be why I stand forever rooted in Ypres , in thought if not in fact . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets in tones and semitones , or of settling the question of whether each planetary sphere has a distinctive pitch or confines itself to a single note , or if , as the ancients believed , the Dorian mode should be assigned to Saturn , the Phrygian to Jupiter , the Lydian to Mars , and so forth . These things are still being sifted and rearranged in the minds of those with a taste for them . They are technical questions on which , I suppose , any professional musician ought to be obliged to state an opinion , but for the moment I do not care to . I only wonder , do the intervals between the spheres correspond to the intervals between notes ? For that interval is silence , and it is only in that silence that the music of the spheres , if it exists at all , can slip through and be heard . <p> True , there are moments when one 's listening is distracted by the presence of our neighbors to the north , those stolid , healthy , industrious burghers , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in homely domestic virtues while at the same time picking your pocket . There is perhaps in human terms something reassuring about them , their positive approach to life . But the moment passes . Here in Flanders we may be nervous and unpredictable , we may live in terror of the unseen and enjoy flirting with damnation , but we abide our existence above sea level and keep our hands to ourselves . <p> Last night I had a dream . I dreamt I was present for the emperor 's Blijde Inkomst , his Joyous Entry into Bruges in the year of Our Lord 1515 . Born with the century , he was a boy of fifteen at the time , and of course not yet the emperor , but I was a mere child in Ypres , and so could not possibly have been in Bruges , and yet there I was , just as surely as I am now . On a raised platform in the midst of the cheering multitude was a tableau that caught everyone 's eye : three women , stark naked but for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , chosen to represent the three goddesses in the Judgment of Paris , perhaps the three Graces  --  from a distance it was hard to tell . For all anyone could see , they might have been three hired prostitutes a little the worse for wear , three exotic captives from the New World , or  --  who knows ? - perhaps the divine ladies themselves , graciously condescending to honor our young emperor apparent . I would have liked to get to know these women , to talk to them , perhaps even venture to touch them , if only to determine their reality and their position in the scheme of things ; and with that in mind I pushed my way through the crowd . I seemed to grow with every step , until I was no longer a child but my normal adult size , even a bit taller if you please . I overtopped the emperor himself , who was only a slack-jawed stripling on a piebald horse ! But as I approached the platform , it became clear that the infamous Jacobus Papa had got there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatting familiarly with those three women , uttering all sorts of ribald remarks and innuendos , even resting his hand momentarily on their breasts and thighs , gestures the women tolerated with good humor like the seasoned whores they were . Then the scene melted away-crowd , boy emperor , women  --  and everything devolved into music . Not , as one might have hoped , the music of the spheres , but something closer to home . Three goats were blowing sackbuts , a wolf was tootling a zink , Barbary apes were sawing away on viols , and a chorus of cats and donkeys sang . But it was by no means the cacophony you might expect . In my dream these animals were performing my Souterliedekens , and performing them better , I might add-despite an instrumental accompaniment I would never approve  --  than many a human singer and player , whose incompetence and insensitivity have so often left me exasperated . For all my disappointment , I awoke feeling strangely refreshed . <p> So here I remain , Jacobus Clemens of Ypres , an Ypres masquerading as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city than a state of mind , and all of it no doubt standing for something else . Figure it out for yourselves , if you have the time and patience . But meanwhile let me be known to posterity as Clemens non Papa , and let posterity interpret that identity any way it likes . Can one lay claim to a negative identity ? Yes , and I welcome it . I would rather be not the pope than not Jacobus Papa ... if you follow me . And that is my last word on the subject . <p> It has become dangerous to go out at night . The streets and alleyways of Bruges are infested with beggars and footpads . Everywhere there are scurrilous or mocking graffiti , lewd symbols , grotesque genitalia , and invocations to the devil scrawled in charcoal on the walls . And on the door of the poorhouse this sentiment appeared the other day in French , a language we try to discourage in these parts : Cette planete est I'enfer de quelque autre planete . Our planet nothing but the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spheres reduced to the squalling and screeching of the damned ? It shows the deplorable effect that Mynheer Copernicus 's unpublished thesis is already having on our thoughts , our morals , our whole way of life . <p> Domine , miserere . <p> <p> By JOHN SHEPLEY <p>
