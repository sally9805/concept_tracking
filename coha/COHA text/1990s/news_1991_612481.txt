<p> Reading Deborah Scroggins 's Nov. 10 Perspective article , " Under Japan 's scrutiny , " I was surprised to learn that I had become an " agent of influence . " <p> I also have been the guest of a Japanese organization on an all- expense-paid trip to Japan . Unlike Ms. Scroggins , I fell for Japan 's desire for friendship with the United States . <p> It is true that the Japanese have an intense concern for what others , especially Americans , think about their country . Public opinion surveys indicate some Americans are now viewing Japan as an adversary . <p> The same surveys show the Japanese gradually losing their gratitude for U.S. generosity following World War II and feeling that the superpower is not so super any longer . <p> All relationships between nations need constant re-evaluation and adjustment . Japan and the United States are no different . <p> Japan continues to make economic and trade changes , and Americans need to correct their image of Japan as a closed market . Japanese foreign investment holds the key to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While there are cultural differences , Japan has removed most trade barriers to the point that the major barrier now is the Japanese consumer . It is important for Americans to remember that Japanese business culture and consumer tastes lie outside government jurisdiction . <p> American firms that are profiting in Japan adjust their products to local tastes and in reality become multilocal instead of multinational corporations . <p> The U.S.-Japan partnership is critical to both countries , which together have close to 40 percent of the world 's production of goods and services . Americans depend on Japan for semiconductors , machine tools and scores of consumer goods . <p> Japan in turn owes much of its prosperity to the U.S. market and uses its earned dollars to fund the U.S. national debt . It is not so much that the United States and Japan need each other as that they have become part of each other . <p> Overall , it is obvious that Japanese business and industry are setting the standard of excellence for the rest of the world . The entrepreneurial answer to Japan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster cooperation between labor and management , reduce the budget deficit , promote long-term economic strategies , and increase our understanding of international markets . <p> Unfortunately , Ms. Scroggins provided little clarification of the real issues . <p> DONALD F. YATES <p> Roswell ; Turnout for Veterans Day Parade disappointing <p> It bothers me that we made every effort for people to be at the Braves ' parade , but not for the Veterans ' Day parade . <p> To honor the Braves , we excused kids from school and had the parade during lunch so more people could attend . But for people who have served our country , they get half of the road closed off and the parade is scheduled at a very inconvenient time . <p> Where is all of the patriotism we had when all of our servicemen and women were in the Persian Gulf region ? There are still American soldiers over there , but where are all of the flags and yellow ribbons ? <p> We have a national holiday to pay tribute to the people who have fought and died for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when a lot of people have the entire day off . <p> We need to look at this as a lesson learned and next year make more of an effort to show our support and appreciation for these truly brave men and women . <p> ANGIE IVEY <p> Mableton ; All share child 's tragedy <p> After the senseless death of Xavier Bennett , those of us who care continue to ask why do drug users continue to pump this garbage into their bodies ? Why do drug dealers continue to sell it without any regard for their freedom and safety or that of others ? <p> Why do some people sit idly by and allow this activity to go on ? And all the while , innocent people , innocent children are dying as a result . <p> Young Xavier Bennett should be alive today , but he 's not . He was victim of a stepfather who obviously did n't care , otherwise he would not have jeopardized his family 's safety and well-being . <p> Did the mother know what was going on ? Could she have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our underpaid and overworked law enforcement officials have a tough problem to deal with here , but they too are partly responsible for little Xavier 's death . <p> Forget the debate over which gun fired the fatal bullet . If the police had any concern that innocent people could occupy the apartment where suspect Bobby Bowman lived , they should have arrested him during the drug sales he allegedly made to them earlier . <p> Who 's child is next ? Does the child of a celebrity have to be victimized before the public takes a stand on this issue ? It 's up to the people at the center of the problem to do something about it and now . <p> BYRON L. EVANS <p> Atlanta <p> The tragic story of young Xavier Bennett is only another symptom of the growing drug disease that seems to be gripping Atlanta and our nation . <p> The mothers and fathers in all socioeconomic levels who permit drug use or dealing in their homes are consigning their children to an early death whether from a drug bust , a deal gone bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child into using or dealing . <p> Sharing equal responsibility for Xavier 's death are the affluent " recreational-victimless crime " users who help create and stimulate the market for the growth and distribution of drugs . <p> Rest in peace , Xavier Bennett . Pehaps the loss of your innocent young life will cause others to think twice before they condemn their loved ones to your fate . How many children is it going to take ? <p> SHELBY N. FRANCIS <p> Norcross ; The hunters fire back at Steed 's deer column <p> . . . Please , Robert Steed , stick to the courtrooms and golf courses . <p> Mr. Steed in a recent column points out that deer are unarmed . People who oppose hunting like to make a case for giving the deer weapons . But a deer has natural weapons against hunters - their incredible senses of sight , smell and hearing . <p> Hunters are actively responsible for the meat we put on the table . People who buy their meat at the grocery store are wrong in their assumption that their hands are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals . It would be more appropriate to arm the cows and chickens . <p> DARYL KIRBY <p> Marietta <p> . . . Robert Steed 's column was offensive and ill-informed . His feeble attempt to mollify hunters by his weak statement that not all are " low-browed , hairy-backed males " falls flat when followed by his broad generalizations of them as drivers of oversized vehicles emblazoned with violence-oriented bumper stickers , as purveyors of Star Wars hunting paraphernalia and possessors of an uncontrollable blood lust to kill , kill , kill . <p> As a whole , I believe Mr. Steed would find hunters ( deer and otherwise ) to be a concerned , vigilant and conservation-oriented group . <p> LUCINDA L.
