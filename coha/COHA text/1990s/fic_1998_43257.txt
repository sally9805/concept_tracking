The young woman in 15F stood looking out her window . Thousands of other windows-wavy rectangles , shaken towels of light-seemed to signal in code , You are not alone . <p> Of course , she was not alone , anyway . Margaret turned back to the living room , where her Nebraska mother was sitting up very straight . <p> " Twenty-eight is not old , " Margaret said , correctively , to her mother , who was already nodding in agreement . <p> Her mother agreed too easily . It was a habit she had always had with men , and , now that they were grown , she was doing it to her own children . <p> Did n't she think anything at all ? <p> " No , " her mother began , " oh no , not now . Twenty-eight is still young . You 're just getting to the beginning of your real life . " Not that , either , Margaret thought . In her grim assessment , she had been living a real life for some time now . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Four years ago , Margaret had begun a novel about her greatgrandmother , who 'd come to Nebraska on a covered wagon . Although , when asked , Margaret frequently said she expected to finish Horizon Farm within the calendar year , truly , she saw no end . <p> Her mother was talking about marriage . Marriage was what Margaret was or was not old for . Marriage was what her mother meant by real life , although she herself had now endured more than four decades without it . This was her after-real-life life . <p> There had been an article in the newspaper . College-Graduate Spinsters on the Rise , Study Shows . Mothers in fifty states had clipped the piece out and sent it to their daughters . The study , conducted at Stanford , said that American women were not marrying later , as many of these mothers had hoped , they were marrying less . As a teenager , Margaret 's mother had been admitted to Stanford , but she 'd not gone . She 'd stayed in Tulsa , to Get Married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper said , she 'd most likely not get married at all . <p> Margaret 's friends , the spinsters themselves , read the article , too , but they did n't clip it out or send it anywhere . <p> " No one I know is married ! " Margaret had screamed at Harold , her running partner , " none of our friends ! " Harold was also twenty-eight , also single , but not of the marriageable variety . <p> ' Course I 'm only twenty-eight , she was thinking , as she listened to Harold 's not-quite consolations . That gives me two more years . <p> Now , when her mother tentatively mentioned the article , Margaret said , " I do n't want to get married , anyway . " <p> Thousands of girls told their mothers long-distance they were n't sure if marriage was for them . But in Manhattan , these same young women , including Margaret , sat in the offices of therapists whose fifty-minute hours strained their budgets , and spoke of why they were n't meeting " anyone " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they found themselves not in love or loved , alone . <p> In the case of Margaret , there was not absolutely " no one . " There was a Bob . <p> Everyone was trying to make the best of him . <p> The amazing thing was that he seemed entirely oblivious of the huge effort these courtesies were costing and seemed to strain to accept them . <p> Because of the newspaper article , Margaret 's mother had come to New York in August . She 'd taken her vacation here in the citv all vacationers had left . The corners of Margaret 's eyes stung when she saw her mother 's suitcase open a little , like a clam , on the five-o'clock-made bed . ( Margaret had promised herself her normal Friday . She 'd worked all morning in the office , and when everyone left for the jitney at three , in old but somehow immaculately clean sneakers , she closed her door and turned to Horizon Farm . Then , she hurried home , hid things , and got on the train to the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where all we 'd be going , " her mother said . Parties , she 'd imagined , judging from the chiffon packed in tissue . So much . <p> Margaret chose the nicest restaurant they could walk to from her apartment , but as she watched her mother 's carefulness , sipping the bad wine as if it were fragrant , she felt sorry . It was not only that the city 's good restaurants were elsewhere ( this was a poor-ish , student neighborhood ) , but that these restaurants hardly seemed to be restaurants at all-they seemed to be fronts pretending to be restaurants , while actually functioning as something else entirely . Periodically one would close , and its replacement would offer a different cuisine , another shabby decor , and a menu newly minted at Kinko 's , but still it would be not quite credible . <p> " I thought you 'd be tired , " Margaret said . <p> " Oh , I 'm not tired . " Her chin raised slightly to the city 's possibilities . <p> What would they do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen years once , and now four days seemed an outward-bound-scale challenge . They 'd lived together , but they had n't recreated , exactly . They 'd eaten dinners , Margaret had done her homework . Her mother moved around the house picking up . <p> Museums , Margaret thought . That was just the kind of thing they had never done together . <p> Why ? <p> Saturday morning offered a typical New York summer day : moist , warm , with rising winds blowing debris against your ankles , the sky not clear but white . <p> It was unmistakably a weekend , when the rich and even the enterprising were somewhere else already . There was a time Margaret 's mother believed Margaret would become one of those people ; now she was n't sure . <p> And for years , Margaret had been trying to make weekends feel like other days-a Tuesday , perhaps , or a Friday . She needed the time away from her job for Horizon Farm , but there was something about the span of Saturday afternoon that seemed overarching . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summons calling out pairs to the street cafes for brunch . <p> " I do n't brunch , " she said to her mother . " I 've usually eaten one , if not two meals by then . " <p> Margaret showed her the museum listings . There was a traveling show of Dutch paintings . Years ago , on her ten-week charter flight college summer backpacking trip through Europe , she 'd seen two paintings by Rembrandt , ( Idealized ) Portrait of the Artist at 27 and Portrait of the Artist at 27 . The two small paintings were different enough that twenty-year-old Margaret could imagine falling in love with the idealized one but not the other . She 'd wanted to see them again when she was twenty-seven . <p> Of course , she was twenty-eight now , not in love and with her mother in a cement-floored croissant shop that would have been crowded if it were n't August . Though the streets felt deserted , everything was still open . They tore the airy morsels with their fingers , standing up . <p> Her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city was a way Margaret liked it , the air soft , wet , warm , a little sooty , like a bundle of damp wash in your arms . Everyone leftover fit together like people at a singles ' dance . <p> " Where is the good shopping area ? " her mother said . " I 'd like to buy you some new clothes . " <p> Margaret glared at her as if she 'd said something nonsensical . Even tragic . Was n't it obvious this was something she did n't know ? Did Margaret look like someone who shopped ? <p> Her mother had been the sweetheart of Kappa Kappa Gamma and had never tried hard enough to get over it . <p> Then what had happened to Margaret all her life began ; she felt herself softening , dissolving on one side to join her mother . <p> She was offended , but perhaps she could also be intrigued . Even tempted . Maybe some new clothes would be nice . There was a girl at work , her boss , sort of , whom she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , Caroline did n't stay in town summer weekends . <p> But Caroline was fluent in clothes . Last week a girl had called her from Texas asking to borrow a certain dress , and Caroline FedExed it , right from the magazine office . <p> Last week , Margaret had been in a store with Caroline . They were on their way to an appointment , and Caroline wanted to pick up a skirt from alterations . While they waited , she ordered Margaret , her sort-of assistant , to try on a shorts-suit , something Margaret had never known to exist . The outfit was made entirely out of seersucker . <p> " You need something like that , " Caroline declared . <p> Margaret mimicked that with hilarity to her friends . As if anyone ever needed a shorts-suit . <p> Even besides the money , which was more than the balance in her checking account , Margaret knew she had a gravity , some largeness of face and asymmetry , that was mostly a misfortune but in her better moods could seem like the beginnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that as much as Margaret annoyed her , she also knew she would never be fired . Caroline was the managing editor , but Caroline had a Reading Block . She saw a psychoanalyst four times a week , connecting the meaning of the word bin-what they used at the magazine to keep manuscripts in-to the word Ben , her father 's name . Caroline depended on Margaret to read for her and often repeated Margaret 's comments as her own . <p> Margaret did n't mind . She was n't trying to work her way up . For her , this was a job to support Horizon Farm . Now that everyone else better at these things was away , it felt easier to enter stores . <p> Margaret 's mother was intrepid . She 'd lived long enough to understand that the membranes of snobbery in stores and restaurants would all dissolve at the touch of money . <p> She was worried about Margaret , clearly . Sometimes Margaret thought her manners caused her mother 's consternation ; at other moments , she was sure it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if conducting a mandatory inspection . At one , Margaret spotted the shortssuit and started her mimicry . <p> " Now that 's becoming , " her mother said , hands on hips . <p> It went on the take pile . <p> Margaret 's mother took full charge . She seemed to regret Margaret 's taste . " That ? It 's dull as dishwater . " <p> " You look like a little schoolmarm , " she said , opening the buttons of a blouse . <p> Sex seemed to be switching on Margaret , in a way that made her sit down dizzy on the velvet padded bench of the changing room . After a whole lifetime of whispered threats-They 're going to want , he will try , take ... from you-now it seemed no one was trying at all , and her mother wanted to gussy her up . <p> It had been only a game , after all . <p> Margaret followed mutely into the various departments : lingerie , stockings , shoes . Her mother became imperial , a general . She told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . <p> Margaret asserted herself only once , over a pair of black pants , the item she wore every day , the item most young women in New York wore almost every day . <p> " Let 's buy two , " Margaret said , when her mother discovered a pair that fit , after making her try on thirteen and examining them from behind . Then that would be done , for a long time . <p> " But everybody 'll think you have on the same thing all the time . " <p> At lunchtime , they sat in the exact center of a waving , murmuring , many-tentacled restaurant , surrounded by shiny shopping bags . <p> Her mother was talking about how her dentist met the girl he married . <p> " She 's adorable . And they rock climb with the baby . " Why was it that marriage still seemed to her the high bright thing ? Margaret 's father had been killed in a sailboat accident when she was three . She did and did not remember him . She had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harrowing years with Martin Brody , a Tulsa banker who 'd turned out to be mean . <p> " Mom , why do you care so much if I get married ? It did n't work for you . " <p> " No , " her mother said , suddenly shy , perhaps offended . It embarrassed her to be unmarried . " No , but having children did . And I would have liked to have that , too . I want you kids to have it because I did n't . " <p> " But you have friends . You always worked . That 's a good life , too . " <p> " Oh , yes , a very good life . But I 'd like you to have both . " Who could argue with both , whatever it was . As if both was just what you had now , and the other , neither shaved down or changed . Double the Fun . <p> " Should we go look at paintings ? " Margaret said , as they walked out of the restaurant , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's pleasures , if she were Margaret 's age , here , now . Her mother would have found a share with five other girls in the Hamptons . They 'd catch rides out , meet one another 's buses , share blouses in the flurry before dinner dates . <p> And there was nothing wrong with it . It probably happened in the Roman Empire . It will be happening in a hundred years . But a man passed them in a raincoat . He looked as if he were on a mission to some used bookstore or a place which sold ancient toy lead soldiers . I would rather be here , Margaret thought , in the sluffy day . <p> Her mother was nervous because there was still time , time to push Margaret up onto the bus , the way she 'd tried all her life . <p> " I do n't know if I feel like a museum now , " she said . " Let 's just go home for a while , if we 're going out tonight . " <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she cried with exasperation at all the shiny colored bags and the loss of that second pair of black pants . " This is n't my life , " she said , half standing in the checker cab . " I should take it all back and just get the other black pants . That 's all I 'll really wear . " <p> Her mother looked at her with utter , innocent incomprehension . <p> " Get them . We 'll call and have the girl put on a hold . " <p> The doorman jumped up . " Mama take you on a shopping spree ! I know . I know . Let me get . " <p> Margaret was truly tired , the way she 'd been tired as a child , after a tantrum . She lay down on her old couch and fell fast asleep . <p> When she woke up , the window was open , a phone was ringing somewhere , in the steady New York air-noise outside , her mother was in Margaret 's old clothes , it was almost dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own phone , alarming , and sat up straight . It was Bob . <p> " Can I call you right back ? " she said . " I fell asleep . " <p> " You 're asleep at five in the afternoon ? Is your mother there ? " " Mm-hm . " <p> " What 's she doing while you 're asleep ? " There was the sound of a snicker , but that was just Bob , Margaret reminded herself . <p> " Cleaning , I think . " <p> " Well , are we on tonight ? " She had told him tonight or tomorrow . <p> " I 'm not sure . Can I call you back ? " <p> " Well , when ? You were going to call me this afternoon . " <p> She was . " I am . Five minutes , " she said , overpromising again . <p> While Margaret slept , her mother had noticed everything she 'd deliberately decided not to worry about until later . <p> " I ran out to the hardware store , " her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here tonight and organize a little , but it 's up to you . " <p> The way she saw it , the girl was fine , the job was enough , the problem had to be decor . <p> Because of course there was a problem . Twenty-eight . Only a Bob . <p> As Margaret went through the bags , she found six cans of paint . Her mother , it turned out , had spent almost three hundred dollars . She 'd already begun reorganizing . She 'd moved bookshelves and taken down torn rice paper blinds . Perhaps this was the eternal work of mothers visiting daughters in city apartments . <p> After the first surprise , she would never say shock , no , just a little taken aback , that was all , she pitched in , trying to help her child in this foreign world . <p> At the bottom of one bag was a Kleenex box holder , made out of some type of woven reed . <p> " Mom , I do n't even use Kleenex . " <p> " I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of toilet paper she 'd collected from the bedside table and floor , picking up another from the desk . <p> They decided to put off Bob until tomorrow . <p> " Then he can see what we 've done a little , " her mother said , opening paint cans with a butter knife . " See which colors you like . Never pick a color without putting it on the wall first . " <p> These were the koans of Margaret 's home education . Never let anyone cut your cuticles , just push back . It was all enough to make her cry . She was so behind . <p> It appeared that Margaret 's kitchen/hallway presented problems . For one thing , it was a kitchen/hallway . The majority of the sink was tucked behind a structural pillar . There was very little cutting room , but Margaret 's mother had found a bracket that would allow a chopping block to be pulled out and then folded down flush against the wall . The hardware store would be delivering the butcher board before seven . <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the middle of the room , and they 'd begun painting . The New York sky out the window was deep blue . There were no screens . <p> " I love these summer nights with no mosquitos . " <p> " They 're in the Hamptons , " Margaret said . " We 're too high up . " <p> The walls teal blue with yellow trim , Margaret was sorry to put her own furniture back . Her couch was inoffensive , though there were coffee stains , but her chairs were ordinary , and her desk dominated most of the living room . <p> She looked to her mother . " Should I move it ? " <p> " This is where you are most of the time . You might as well have the view where you work . Besides , if you have people over , throw on a cloth , and it 'll be your dining table . " <p> Margaret was grateful to her mother for recognizing the small temple . Her mother had never worked at home . She liked getting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was never something else her mother wanted to do more . Except this . Her and her brother . <p> They stayed up all night fixing . Her mother had such stamina . This was what they 'd done together , been good at . It had been difficult when they 'd been trying to find New York 's pleasures , but , working , they both felt easy . <p> " I do n't know about you , but I 'm starving , " Margaret 's mother finally said . " New York has to have some all-night eatery . " <p> " It does . The Empire Diner . Let 's go . " <p> They took a taxi just as the sky was getting light . " Wait a minute , what 's this ? Stop , please , sir . " <p> " It t is a flea market , " the man said . <p> Margaret 's mother found two lace panels that would be drapes in the bedroom and a throw to cover the splotchy couch . <p> They ordered large plates of eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Bob 's call woke them again . Flake by flake , the sky outside the windows devolved to twilight , ashes mixing into gorgeous color . <p> " Well , where should we go ? " <p> The apartment , always a treasure , at $460 a month , with its fields of view , punctuated by steeples and water towers , now seemed loved inside , too . " We painted everything , you should come see . " " You want to eat up there ? " It was a joke with them , already , one of their few agreements , that there was nowhere to eat north of 60th . <p> Bob had an actual income . Usually , they went to modest places , anyway , but for her mother he would probably splurge . <p> " How about come here , and then we 'll go down to dinner . " <p> " Let 's eat up there , then . I do n't want to come up and then go down again . " <p> But that 's what he would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knew , though , that there was no arguing or he 'd be silent all night , with that glittering edge . <p> She had to pick . Already the rope sagged . She wanted her mother to have an elegant New York dinner . Bob seeing her apartment , with its dean corners , was n't worth Upper Upper West Side food . <p> " He ca n't just come pick us up ? " Margaret 's mother said . Margaret shook her head . Nothing looked right on her , either , none of the new clothes . In the dresses , she looked dressier , but no more and possibly less pretty . Less because they called attention to her trying . This was an argument Margaret and her mother had had forever . Margaret thought a really beautiful woman looked best in just anything , old jeans , a T-shirt , hair back in a rubber band . Margaret 's mother believed anyone , beautiful or not , looked best in a well-cut dress . <p> Margaret tried on each new item , shaking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this nose , she decided . Finally , she put on the black pants . The other things exposed parts of herself to a lineup , as if she were entering her knees in a contest . <p> " You 're not going to dress a little ? " her mother said . <p> " I just ca n't . " <p> The restaurant was a place Margaret had heard of . Published writers ate there and editors who were more famous than the writers . Of course it was just a restaurant , and so many other people went , too . Caroline came here with dates who were not the guy she lived with . The one she lived with and loved , for whom Margaret composed grand , carved letters , Caroline kept hidden the way you might keep a cat if your building did n't allow pets . <p> Many people seemed to be speaking foreign languages . They sat at the front , where the doors opened to the street , and in the trees outside , someone had strung lights . <p> Bob was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to meals . <p> He was , as always , polite , at least on the incoming side . He was capable of great silence . Most of their time together seemed to be spent with Margaret teasing words out of him , by means of shock . Sometimes she became more and more audacious , to shake him as if some penny inside would rattle . <p> But to her surprise , her mother 's soft , beckoning questions seemed to elicit more . He was already embarked on a long amiable conversation about the vagaries of foreign investment . He and her mother seemed to exchange some signal , every minute or so , to confirm their agreement . <p> All this made Margaret sullen . Who was Bob ? Anyway . <p> A nice man . Not someone unkind or unreliable . <p> Could she love him ? <p> In a way , perhaps . Truly , she did n't know . <p> Did he love her ? <p> He had an interest , a certain grudging respect . But no , not love , would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after ten years of hard work ! Reasonably enough , " he said , " so now they 're making a huge general case about it . " <p> His argument was often that the world , Margaret included , made too big a fuss . <p> Could she do better ? Was there more to be had in the world ? <p> Yes , but she did not know for sure . She had an inkling . But sometimes it seemed that all happiness would be temporary , followed by pain . <p> Was it only a matter of attitude ? <p> She understood that she has not been blessed with a good disposition . She has better hair . <p> " I knew it , " her mother was saying emphatically . <p> Margaret became even more silent . In this kind of conversation , there seemed no place for her . She excused herself to the ladies ' room . <p> There was some grinding , endless quality to their srx . Often she wanted to stop halfway through and go to sleep . She would look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hours she devoted to Horizon Farm . Bob himself was an insomniac . It was disconcerting . Sometimes she 'd wake up , and he 'd be staring at her , propped on an elbow . She immediately worried that she 'd been sleeping unattractively , maybe with her mouth open . <p> She had been in New York now five years . Her mother had visited once before , near the beginning . <p> Margaret had been in love then , the way she imagined people are . She believed for a while she held a portion of that true thing which was at once rare and altogether common . The boy had seemed a little too good for her , she 'd been amazed he liked her , grateful and always nervous . He talked a way she just loved and always made himself sound average . <p> Yes , she had been in love once , but it had n't been the same for him , she knew that really , even from the start , there was something slippery about his feelings for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to play his affections a bit , lift them . Taking counsel from her running partner , Harold ( who often gave the same advice she rejected from her mother ) , she tried to NOT CALL . Once , Harold instructed her to send a postcard from her vacation with no message on it , only her name . <p> The thing about really being in love was Margaret understood her mother then . Because she would have done anything for that boy . Her work seemed a front , like those fake restaurants , the only real business was trying to keep him . <p> " Narrow escape , " Harold called it . <p> And since that first important boy in New York , Margaret had made many tries . There had been a handsome sculptor , talented , but not verbal . He had n't liked Lawrence of Arabia , at one point calling it Attila the Hun . <p> There had been a pointy-faced collage photographer , who turned out to be dangerous . <p> There was a bisexual high school teacher , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch , everything feeling jagged and mushy , his elbow in soft parts of her , his mouth wobbly and unstable . There was a stagnant , never-ending feeling to the afternoon . She needed to get outside for air desperately , but when they took a walk , there was still no air . <p> All of their names went unmentioned in her Sunday phone calls home . <p> As Margaret had grown up , in Nebraska , her mother had had several Bobs . There was real-estate Bob , machine-part-salesman Bob , and Bob the ex-Jesuit , who was still her friend . Her mother had n't married any of them , either . <p> Bob never drank , only Diet Coke , and never touched dessert , but tonight he ordered a piece of pie and actually refilled Margaret 's mother 's wineglass . <p> Once , Margaret 's mother reached over and touched her forehead . <p> " Are you feeling all right ? " she asked . " I 'm not used to my girl so quiet , " she said to Bob . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choking laugh , and this became another of their agreements . <p> " I 'm fine , " she said . <p> Her mother looked down at her ice cream dish , and Bob glanced away , beyond the trees to the dark Village apartments and streets . <p> When they said goodbye at the front of the restaurant , she felt a way she had n't even remembered-like a girl with her mother , at the age she just began to wish her mother was not there , because whoever she was was not possible in the presence of this larger force . <p> Monday morning , Margaret took her mother on the bus she always took , and they walked the seven blocks together she usually walked by herself . It was quiet , commerce closed for the holiday . <p> No one else was in the building , but she had keys . She took her mother up the grand elevator , down the winding , cluttered halls , to her office . Her mother stood looking . " So this is it .

All her mothers ' friends knew that Margaret was a New York Magazine Editor . She 'd bought them subscriptions for Christmas . Margaret understood that , for her mother , succeeding as a writer or just staying the editor she already was seemed just about the same , equalboth good . Sometimes this exasperated Margaret ( what she was trying was so hard , she was n't good enough yet , far from it ) , and her job was just her job , which she 'd felt too good for for years , though some days it gave her relief . <p> Those days , when she got out of the office at six o'clock and walked out into the blast of warm , solid air , she tried to feel like the hundreds of other people wearing New York clothes and sneakers , walking out of offices , carrying take-out cups .

Her mother really did n't agonize over Margaret 's hope of success . She just wanted her to get married . <p> And that was a far easier thing to do , if you really wanted . There was a guy in San Francisco who 'd been her boyfriend in college . He said he 'd marry her if nobody else turned up . Last Christmas , when there had been a blizzard , he sent her a down coat for Christmas . <p> No , it would n't be hard to get married . To get that feeling she 'd had once , that was what was hard .

No , better than that . He had integrity . <p> She thought maybe if she kept going to her therapist long enough , she would cease to think of the male population as Him and Other People . The way to make it honorable was to just forget about him and start from scratch with the Other People . To take them one at a time . <p> Right now , to imagine marrying Bob was depressing , but so was being in love again , with shaking misery . <p> " Life is exhausting , when you ca n't even have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She tried explaining to her mother but ended up just shrugging . <p> So she showed her the place where she spent most of her day , a huge square chair in the corner , and felt grateful her mother did n't say anything about slip-covering . There were splits in the fabric where yellow foam poked out , but the firm broad arm supported her morning coffee . That was where she sat all day and read . <p> This was her job ! Someday , she would die , and she would have made her living , watching the snow sew steady seams on brick buildings between heaven and earth , reading . <p> Much that she 'd talked about to her mother was here . On a shelf sat the bin/Bens full of manuscripts . <p> Margaret showed her the case of champagne in the refrigerator , sent to Caroline by one of the young men at a publishing house . In reply , Caroline had ordered an ice chest from Better Homes and had it messengered to him with a card that said Cool it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd sent back with no message : a huge toaster oven they all used now , which was a mess with poppy seeds from a month 's worth of bagels . <p> Margaret 's mother found it incredible how much money Caroline and her friends spent on flirtation . " Ridiculous , really , " she said . <p> And yet , all those young men were , to Caroline , only Bobs . The one she really loved was addicted , hidden . <p> " Still , a little romance is a nice thing to have . More than Bob , maybe . " <p> " I thought you liked him . " <p> " Oh , I did . I do . But I do n't see him with you , really . This project of yours . When do you think you 'll be finished ? I want to give a party . " <p> Maybe after last night , after Bob , her mother was finally giving up on her . She was asking her about her work , acquiescing , at last . Maybe from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suspense , foreign as they were , as if she 'd been given a sheet of pronunciations . She 'd never insist on shopping again . <p> Perhaps she would no longer think of her daughter as stubborn but as unfortunately handicapped . She would send her pens for gifts . <p> When other people asked Margaret how close she was to finishing , she lied . In fact , she almost always felt she was lying when she talked about her work . When she 'd been in love , she was lying when she sat down to work . The lie then was that she wanted to at all . But now , she liked to go in her sloppy , loose , spill-marked clothes into the easy room , the playroom , the cry room , the curlon-the-floor room , but she did n't really want an end . She could go on like this longer-being in the somewhere middle . She said , al do n't know if I can . " <p> Margaret understood how hard it was for her mother to have her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret always liked the foggy days , when everyone else was sorry to miss the beach . She seemed amazed that Margaret wanted to keep on like this , never proud , never celebrating , always living for the something she would still do . Margaret had an aversion to drama . The normal high points of life meant nothing to her . <p> As a girl , she 'd seemed dumbfounded when people tried to celebrate her high school graduation . <p> " As if it 's some achievement ? " she 'd said . <p> It had been the same with college . Her mother sat in the front row , clapping , though Margaret had n't even gotten around to renting a gown . <p> But Margaret was n't really such a moper . She just did n't know how to prove it . How to explain a preference for the normal hours ? <p> She truly loved New York 's blowy days , the round air leaping into her lap like a light child . Men in raincoats , hands in pockets , scouring the street on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailboat used to being herself , tiny , manning ropes inside , but being watched from far away on the shore . People saw not her steering , but only the big bright billow of white sails . <p> It was one thing to reject the life your mother had . It was another to turn away from what she 'd wished for . <p> But then again , except for the boy in San Francisco who 'd sent her the down coat , who was offering ? <p> Even that boy had a girlfriend now . Actually , that was why he 'd sent the coat . A soft apology . <p> That night , Harold called , wanting to run . <p> " Go , " her mother said . <p> " Well , we should probably get dressed if we 're going out . " This was her mother 's last night , and Margaret had already made the reservation . <p> " Do you have any vegetables ? We 've been eating such rich food , let 's just steam something here , " Margaret 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist . <p> " I mean it , " her mother said . <p> Margaret and Harold ran , as they always did , in the darkening dusk of Riverside Park , downhill toward the Boat Basin . They passed the gated subway tunnels , where they saw a flicker of fire . Margaret assumed hobos lived there , homeless men , and the kisses of flame were them lighting their cigarettes or joints . It was strange to have a subway tunnel , all caves and darkness , under such a populated treed and flowered park , but it was New York , and even the entrance to those caves was arched , gated in artnouveau black metal . <p> " WPA " Harold said . <p> Tonight the flame was insistent . <p> " Have you ever been in there ? " she asked . <p> " No . Always sort of wanted to . " <p> " Hope the poor guy does n't burn himself . " <p> " Not burning himself . That 's a signal . Somebody wants a date . " She looked at Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wedge , to the mystery of his suspense . <p> After , they stopped at the Korean market and bought Diet Cokes . <p> When they walked into the apartment , Margaret 's mother 's suitcase was waiting neatly by the door , and the apartment was shining with lit candles , the summer windows open . Her mother had set the desk/table for dinner by the view . <p> On the suitcase , Margaret banged her knee , and her breath started stuttering . It was their last night , and only now they 'd found their ease , she felt again their old love . But the plane was booked , the suitcase packed and buckling . <p> Margaret would have to sit through the after-ride for days in an aching way that resembled the demolition of a breakup . Less acutely because it was not a new breakup . It was just a reminder of what had been once , for a long time , and was now over . And maybe love like that , where you lived with someone and they cared about you every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold came out of the shower in his black jeans and shirt , his wet hair combed . He bent down to kiss Margaret 's mother , whom he called Janine , and asked about her office friends by name . <p> She made Margaret try on the new dresses for him . <p> They sat in the long , slow twilight , Harold and her mother around the desk/table . <p> As Margaret stepped out of the tangling clothes in her large bathroom ( somehow the square footage lost from the narrow kitchen/hallway reincarnated in this pink and black bathroom ) , she heard her mother 's somber voice answering , and she leaned back against the cool tile . <p> It was easy to try on clothes for her best audience out there laughing , from whom there was nothing to gain or lose . Margaret looked in the mirror at her uneven but still young face . <p> Maybe the ( Idealized ) Portrait of the Artist had been what Rembrandt really looked like at twenty-seven , only he could n't see it himself then . <p> Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , she would look back at tonight , an average night , one of millions , the way a girl who marries a prince from a faraway land might remember the friendship she 'd had with the boy in her castle as real life , though it had nothing to do with the word love . <p>
