Why they failed to stop the war <p> Those who spent a large part of the days leading up to January 16 in arguments over whether the U.S. should go to war with Iraq sooner , later , or not at all  --  arguments that flared up like grease fires in the middle of previously pleasant conversations around the dinner table , on the phone , in bars  --  may be surprised to learn of the one forum that managed to stay above the fray : the United States Senate . Somehow , both on the Senate floor and off it , the members of the greatest deliberative body in the world pretty much avoided getting dragged into messy debates with each other about the efficacy of sanctions , the validity of the Munich analogy , the staying power of the coalition . <p> This is not to say that senators did n't dig deep into their own souls , agonizing over what Robert Byrd , for one , called the most important vote of his 39-year congressional career . In fact , it 's when you assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of experience and their gut instincts in reaching their decisions , that their failure to try to guide others to the mountaintop seems most odd . When you further consider what was at stake  --  as Dale Bumpers declared , " The need for thoughtful , sensible debate has never , never been greater "  --  this failure begins to seem not merely odd , but outrageous . <p> From Thursday , January 10 , through Saturday the 12th , Congress met to consider whether to grant George Bush the authority to take the country to war once the UN Security Council 's deadline expired . Those days are widely regarded as having restored much of the faded luster of both houses . David Broder summed up that view , writing , " One thing on which everyone could agree ... was that Congress  --  that familiar whipping boy  --  had dealt with the issue of authorizing the use of force in a manner befitting the gravity of the subject . The weekend debate was civil and somber , always serious and often eloquent . " Certainly , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And no doubt it was civil . But by any reasonable standard , it was not debate . <p> The curious antidebate tenor of the proceedings was established on day one . There was a sharp , promising exchange between Senators Paul Sarbanes and Arlen Specter over whether Secretaries Dick Cheney and James Baker had declared that sanctions had failed . Joe Biden took the floor to make his prepared statement , but Tom Harkin of Iowa , evidently excited by his colleagues ' argument , asked Biden for 30 seconds to raise a couple of related points . Here 's how the ensuing colloquy appears in the Congressional Record . Harkin began enthusiastically : <p> Mr. HARKIN . Mr. President , again , I was hoping we might get into these kinds of colloquies on the floor . I know senators want to give their speeches and express their views on this issue , but I hope that we will have enough time to be able to engage in these kinds of colloquies on the Senate floor to ferret out information that is false or inaccurate , or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I want to respond to a couple of things that the distinguished senator from Pennsylvania Specter said , for whom I have the greatest respect . <p> Mr. DANFORTH . Mr. President , a parliamentary inquiry . Who has the floor ? <p> The PRESIDING OFFICER . The senator from Delaware . <p> Mr. DANFORTH . I object to the senator from Iowa making speeches on the time of the senator from Delaware . <p> The PRESIDING OFFICER . The unanimous consent was made and , without objection , it was agreed to . <p> Mr. DANFORTH . Mr. President , what was the request ? <p> The PRESIDING OFFICER . For the senator from Iowa to be recognized for 30 seconds . <p> Mr. DANFORTH . How much of that time remains ? <p> The PRESIDING OFFICER . The 30 seconds have expired . The senator from Delaware is recognized . <p> Mr. BIDEN .... <p> Oh , well . Thus swatted down , Harkin , who together with Brock Adams had bravely challenged the majority leader to get the debate scheduled in the first place , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor again . The Sarbanes-Specter exchange was one of only two animated back-and-forths between two senators in the three days of speeches ( the other came Friday morning , between Specter and Jeff Bingaman ) . The absence of debate worried some of the participants . " One of the concerns that this senator has is that in the course of the debate today , there have not been very many senators on the floor and there has not been the kind of exchange which I think a matter of this gravity deserves , " said Specter on Thursday . " ... I am hoping we can get into this question in terms of discussion with the senators who are supporting the so-called Mitchell resolution .... " <p> But of the colloquies that took place in the subsequent days , most were intended to bolster the original speaker ; those that were critical of the speaker 's points never got very far . For example , consider Harkin 's next foray into colloquy , on Friday . Bennett Johnston of Louisiana , one of the senators said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement , " I think the Nunn approach of a sustained use of sanctions is the way to go . " Nevertheless , he felt that the president had yoked the nation to his policy and it was too late to back out . You might have expected someone to get up and vigorously press a point Biden made the day before , that " when you find yourself in a hole , stop digging . " Instead , Harkin noted that during the Nunn hearings , General David Jones said that drawing down some of our troops and moving to a rotation policy would not be perceived as a sign of weakness . <p> Mr. JOHNSTON . I would observe I agree with General Jones , but I can tell you the president of the United States does not . <p> Mr. HARKIN . I tend to associate myself with the senator 's remarks . Thank you . <p> That 's debate ? Right after Harkin 's remark , Sam Nunn launched into his floor speech , which was very convincing  --  except that he started out by surrendering : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to add one vote from the senator from Louisiana who is with us in spirit . " That seems like a pretty poor substitute for getting him to join in the flesh . <p> In the three days of " debate , " there were three colloquies on the floor that engaged four or more senators . One of these  --  the high point in those three days  --  occurred after Nunn spoke , when two senators ( Specter and John Warner ) challenged him on various issues , while one ( Donald Riegle ) asked him to expand on a point he had raised . The other two arguments were n't about sanctions , or Saddam , or the alliance with Syria . They were both about Senate procedure : who was going to speak when . For the usually pugnacious Barbara Mikulski , of all people , that was how it should be : " Then there are those saying : Where is the debate ? When are they going to get into an argument ? ... Mr. President , that is not the way this body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of this discussion that I have heard . I see that my colleagues here do not want to argue with other senators . " <p> No one would deny that many senators ' speeches were wise and moving . But they were also often flatly contradictory . And since the senators did n't call each other on their varying conclusions , grappling with one another 's facts and interpretations as Sarbanes and Specter started to do on the first day , for those following at home it was hard to tell who was right ; among those watching from the floor , it was evidently a foregone conclusion that no one would change his mind . It was like spending hours watching two exquisitely trained prizefighters , back to back , shadow-boxing . Hawks in flight <p> This absence of floor debate would seem less significant if every senator were absolutely convinced of his position , or if senators were vigorously trying to persuade one another out of the public 's eye . But many senators on both sides did express grave doubts about their votes , and there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Johnston was n't the only senator to vote with the president while saying he preferred to rely on sanctions . James Jeffords and A1 Gore expressed the same sentiment . Specter himself said , " Had I my preference , I would not have opted for a January 15 date , and I would have given sanctions more of an opportunity to work . " Frank Murkowski , in explaining his decision to authorize using force , said he was not advocating abandoning sanctions : " For those who believe in the use of sanctions , as I do , the only responsible action to take now is to grant the president his request for a realistic threat of force . " And a few of those who expressed confidence in their pro-force votes nevertheless put forth such lightweight arguments-Chuck Robb and Trent Lott come to mind  --  that one has to believe that , after a few minutes alone with Nunn , Pat Moynihan , or Bob Kerrey , they might have begun to see the light . <p> No less a GOP luminary than Bob Dole declared he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how fast we can become engaged in armed conflict .... I want our president to understand this is not some hunting license , that this is to strengthen his hand for peace , not war but for peace . " Later , he added , " ... I think the bottom line is that this is not a blank check , as far as this senator is concerned . I intend to use my influence , if any , in every way that I can to find some peaceful way to resolve the current crisis . It just seems to me that we authorize , we do not mandate . We do not say that it has to be today , tomorrow , or next week . " Of course , the bombs started falling four days later . <p> These men did n't sound like hawks . None of them seemed as committed to war as , we subsequently learned , George Bush had been for months . Is it so hard to imagine that a respectful heart-to-heart talk with a valued antiwar colleague might have swayed the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Red badge or scarlet letter ? <p> But in the modem Senate  --  with senators smothered by staff , wrapped up in fundraising , constantly on the move  --  such heart-to-hearts are rare events , even , evidently , when the issue is a declaration of war . In this case , the majority and minority leaders repeatedly made clear that they were treating each senator 's decision as a " vote of conscience , " to be cast free of all partisan pressure . There would be no vote counts , no arm-twisting . That seems right , although the White House did not act quite so nobly . What 's much harder for an outsider to understand is why individual senators who strongly opposed war  --  who believed , as Nunn put it , that they would not " be able to look the parents , the wives , husbands , and children in the eye and say that their loved ones sacrificed their lives for a cause vital to the United States "  --  did not go door-to-door trying to help their peers recognize that desperate morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote and why , but no one tried to change anybody else 's position . According to Senator Paul Wellstone , " If there was a concerted lobbying strategy , I did n't see it . I do n't think it took place . " Senator Jeffords says that in the days leading up to the vote , he got one call from the Mitchell-Nunn coalition . He ca n't remember who made it . An aide to Harry Reid of Nevada , one of the Democrats to vote with the president , recalls that his senator had one phone conversation with Mitchell , but they " left it up in the air , because he had n't decided . " <p> Senator Kent Conrad says that there were " intense discussions , " but " I did n't see a single senator trying to persuade another senator  --  even senators who took a different view , I did n't see anyone questioning them or upbraiding them . " An aide to Senator Charles Grassley , one of the Republicans to break with the president , says that " once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not take calls from anyone or see anyone .... He felt it was a personal vote , and he wanted to avoid the influence of his colleagues . " And to avoid influencing them , apparently . This was consistent with the Democratic leadership 's approach . According to George Mitchell 's press aide , Diane Dewhirst , Mitchell " would discuss the issues l with other members of the Senate who were of a like mind . " She then offers this cold comfort : " It was virtually the same discussion and debate as occurred on the Senate floor . " <p> " I found that people just felt that this was such a critically important vote that they respected everyone else coming to a decision , even if it was a decision different from theirs , " says Conrad , giving his version of the prevailing Capitol Hill explanation for this absence of influence . That sounds perfectly sensible .. , until you consider that , at least off the Hill , it 's usually the reverse . That is , the more critically important the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persuade others to see things your way . But on today 's Hill , issues are truly " critically important "  --  in the sense that just voting your conscience , instead of winning , is n't good enough  --  only if constituents ' votes , a contributor 's campaign donation , or one 's own prestige is on the line . <p> In the end , the most striking thing about the antiwar antilobby is not how unusual it was , but how similar it was to that of the Senate doves 20 years ago . Even after American ground troops had been fighting and dying in Vietnam for five years , antiwar senators were still genteelly adhering to the decorum of the Senate , still making speeches instead of trying to make policy . Now once again the Senate doves have protested too little and acquiesced to war . Certainly a vote up or down on war and peace should be a matter of individual conscience . But it is a strange moral code that treats as a violation of conscience any efforts to save others from making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a tragic mistake . <p> by James Bennet <p> <p> James Bennet is an editor of The Washington Monthly .
