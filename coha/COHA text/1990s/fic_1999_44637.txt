THERE WAS A SUDDEN SNAPPY rapping sound at Gerson 's door , followed by a sort of inflamed and frenzied tintinnabulation of the doorbell that would not be denied . It was just plain bad timing , because Gerston had been on the verge of plunging into SnuggleDown , the Deep Blue Sleep program provided by the good people at Unconscious Adventures Unlimited for those who wanted some fun during the hours normally reserved for zilch . <p> Excitement , thrills , love , laughter , all these could be yours while you slept ! Things had changed a lot since the bad old days when at some time in every twenty-four hours you had to lie down in a darkened room and let your mind go into a holding pattern for eight or so hours . <p> Until recently , mankind was enslaved to sleep , that ancient enemy of our days and nights that condemned us to spend a third of our lives just hanging around doing nothing , and without anything to show for it but vague and generally unsatisfactory dreams that needed highly paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along came the Deep Blue Sleep programs . <p> At last waking entry could be made into the mysterious kingdom of Mind , and this could be accomplished by ordinary people , not just college grads with a Masters or better in Psychedelic Psychology . <p> In this brave new world you could even earn a living while asleep , as a dreammaster , for example , or , if that position was filled , there was always room for a dreamslave . And this was a considerable boon for those who were unable to earn anything while awake . <p> The possibilites for inner travel were little short of amazing . Using the automated electronic services available at a price most middle-class citizens could afford , and lower classes aspire to , you could log onto SnuggleDown and plug the old psyche into a Personalized Sleep Corridor that would take you all the way to the Gates ( frequently described as tall and made of iron ) of Death . This became a considerable tourist attraction , and some daring couples even opted for marriage in the Oblivion Zone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , since death was still not completely under the Company 's control , and individual safety could not be guaranteed , even though the Company took every precaution . <p> Gerston had no interest in going to see the Gates of Death . That could wait until he was in a morbid mood . He passed up on the Waterfall of Creative Endeavor , too , figuring his productive period might as well wait until later , since right now he was modeling Procrastination . He did n't even want to see the Eternal Life exhibition , where the Company had created a great composite jellyfish which it kept in a shallow lagoon in southern Florida . <p> The jellyfish was a composite entity made up of the life-essences of thousands , soon to be millions , of subscribers , who had opted for something comfortable and not too demanding as a way of spending eternity . <p> And there were other possibilities . For a little extra you could add on the Limbo Walkers service that would take your mind out from time to time and show it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undying jellyfish . <p> There were other interesting things to do while asleep . They were listed on the Extra Services menu and cost a little more . Gerston had chosen one of those , opting for a deluxe interior adventure . He was ready to begin , but first he had to take care of whoever was at the door . <p> The loud doorbell shried again , and Gerston called out , " Who 's there ? " <p> " Thought-o-gram for Mr. Grumpton . " <p> " Gerston ? " <p> " What I said . " <p> " Who 's it from ? " Gerson asked , because he led a quiet life and hardly ever received thought-o-grams or their near-cousins , intuition-flashes . <p> " Hey , buddy , you wan na know what color it is too and does it smell nice ? Whyncha accept it and see for yourself ? You catch my drift or am I vistling spitzie ? " <p> Gerston had never liked the rudeness of what used to be called the lower classes and now were n't referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow would undoubtedly go away . Still , Gerston wanted to know who had sent him a thought-o-gram and so he unchained the door and opened it . Standing in front of him was a small individual wearing a khaki uniform and a cap on which was written Mercury Thought-Transfer Service . <p> " Do I have to sign for this thought-o-gram ? " Gerston asked . <p> " Naw , just signify assent by an act of mental volition and it will be so noted on the mind-sensitive receipt form which I carry in this small leather pouch . " <p> Gerston signified , and the messenger said , " Here you are , " and touched Gerston 's forehead with a transistorized forefinger . <p> Gerston felt the familiar flash of transmission and waited for the message to appear in his mind . But it did n't . Instead he felt a strange interior sort of a movement . It took him half a beat to realize what this was . Something was stirring and moving inside his mind . <p> Gerston 's first thought was a compact squeamish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody was in his mind ! <p> " Hi , " a woman 's voice in his head said . <p> " What ? " Gerston replied . <p> " I said ' hi . " ' <p> " Yes , but who are you ? " <p> " I 'm Myra . " <p> " Is that supposed to mean something to me ? " <p> " You invited me here , do n't you remember ? " <p> " I did ? " Gerston said . " The details are a little dim . Perhaps if you could just remind me of the circumstances ... " <p> " It was in the letter you wrote me . If you 're ever in these parts , do drop in . ' That sounds like an invitation to me . What was I supposed to do , go to Siberia ? " <p> " I 'm afraid I do n't remember , " Gerston said . " But the thing I do n't understand is , why did n't you just come visit me in the normal fashion ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " <p> " I see . " <p> " But you hate it , do n't you ? " <p> " Well ... " <p> " So I made a mistake . So sue me . So I 'll go kill myself . " <p> " Myra , there 's no need to be melodramatic . Of course I 'm glad to see you . Well , it 's not exactly seeing , but you know what I mean . It 's just that I do n't usually entertain people in my head . " <p> " Do n't you ever get lonely in there all by yourself ? " <p> " Of course I do . But I still don't- " <p> " I know , you still do n't entertain people in your head . Well , do n't worry , I do n't hang around where I 'm not wanted . Where did that delivery boy go ? He said he 'd come back for me . At least I think that 's what he said . It was a little hard making out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you pretended you did ? " <p> " Sure . I do n't like to hurt people 's feelings , Harold . " <p> " What did you call me ? " <p> " I called you Harold , of course . " <p> " I 'm not Harold . " <p> " But of course you are ! " <p> " Hey , I ought to know who I am . I 'm Sid , that 's who I am . " <p> " Sid what ? " <p> " Sid Gerston , of course . " <p> " You 're sure ? " <p> " Of course I 'm sure . " <p> " Not Harold Greeston ? " <p> " No ! " <p> " Then that idiot delivered me to the wrong mind ! " <p> There was a short pause while Gerston tried to think . <p> " As long as you 're here , " Gerston said at last , " I guess you might as well make yourself comfortable . " <p> " Thanks . " There was movement in Gerston 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone sitting down . " Nice place you got here . " <p> " Well , it 's just my mind , of course , but I try to keep it nice . Some might consider it a little austere . " <p> " A little what ? " <p> " Stiff . " <p> " No , I think it 's real nice . You sure got a lot of books in here ! " <p> " Well , I think having a library in one 's mind is important . " <p> " How come these titles blur out when I try to read them ? " <p> " It 's just the ones I have n't read that blur out that way . " <p> " And what 's this here ? A kitchen ? " <p> " A virtual kitchen , actually . I thought it would be rather fun , if you know what I mean . " <p> " But what do you do with it ? " <p> " Well , you can eat by merely reading the recipe you want . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wow , that 's a big book ! " <p> " It 's the Encyclopedia of All Encyclopedias of All Recipes Ever Conceived Since the Beginning of the World , Together with Their Main Variations . As you can imagine , it 's pretty thorough . " <p> " Must have been expensive . " <p> " Yes , but well worth it , especially with its Length of Meal option which lets you set Ingestion Duration anywhere from 5 nanoseconds all the way up to 18 hours for feasts you really want to linger over . And the Intensity scale has an orgasmic level that 's new this year . It makes a good meal just that much more enjoyable . " <p> " Too bad I 'm not hungry . " <p> " You do n't have to be . I also have a Virtual Hunger program that will give you all the appetite you could want . " <p> " I do n't want to be hungry right now . I 'll just wander around a little more , thank you . What 's this , a broom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean . " <p> " In your mind ? " <p> " Of course . Virtual cleanliness is just as important as the real thing . " <p> " Have you got a bathroom here ? " <p> " What would I be doing with a bathroom in my mind ? And what would you need it for ? " <p> " A virtual bathroom will do just as well . My , what a lot of doors . And what is this ? A winding staircase ! I wonder where it leads . " <p> " Do n't go down there ! " <p> " Take it easy . I always enjoy looking around men 's minds . Now this is interesting . It gets darker as I go down . " <p> " Stay out of there ! That staircase leads to the recesses of my mind . Ca n't you read the sign ? It says , ' Unconscious Level . Entry Strictly Forbidden Except to Licensed Psychotherapists . ' I will thank you to keep your nose out of my personal private business . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm down there already . I just want a peek at what 's behind this odd little door ... " <p> " Do n't touch that door ! " <p> " Do n't get so excited . What makes you think you got anything I ai n't seen before ? " <p> " SHUT THAT DOOR ! " <p> There was the virtual sound of a door opening . Then Myra said , " Greck ! " <p> " I beg your pardon ? " Gersten said . <p> " ' Greck ' is the sort of expression my ex-husband Hubert used when he came across something especially nasty . I think what I just saw qualifies . " <p> " I do n't want to talk about it . " <p> " I should think not . You are a dirty bit of business , are n't you ? " <p> " I 'm perfectly normal . All men 's heads have cellar rooms like that . " <p> " You know , I do n't think you know men 's heads very well . The last guy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , you know ? No upstairs or downstairs . And this room was empty except for a pile of stuff in one corner . Do you know what it was ? " <p> " Women 's dismembered bodies ? " <p> " Golf trophies ! Is n't that a scream ? " <p> " I see nothing funny about it . Get out of my Unconscious ! " <p> " In a moment . " <p> " What are you doing now ? " <p> " Looking around . This doorway here .. It leads to the Pleasure Center ! I knew you had to have one ! Everyone 's got one ! " <p> " Leave my Pleasure Center alone ! And what do you mean , everybody 's got one ? " <p> " Well , everybody whose head I 've been in . " <p> " What were you doing in other men 's Pleasure Centers ? " <p> " Well , you know . Someone hires you to go into their Pleasure Center , you do n't spend a whole lot of time asking them what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant " <p> " I 'm not sure . " <p> " Want me to spell it out ? " <p> " No ! Why do you do that sort of thing ? " <p> " Well , it 's a job , you know ? " <p> " No , I do n't know ! " <p> " You 've led a sheltered life . " <p> " So what do you do when you get into a guy 's head ? " Myra hesitated , then said , " Look , maybe we should n't talk about this . " <p> " No , no , it 's all right , tell me . " <p> " You 're not going to like it ... Okay , a guy usually asks me to sit down , make myself comfortable . Sometimes he offers me a drink . It 's not a real drink , of course , it 's a virtual drink , but it helps break the ice . Sometimes he 'll offer me a joint or two , or a couple of snorts of coke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Real coke is , but not virtual coke . " <p> " What do you do then ? " <p> " We fool around a little . " <p> " What do you mean , you fool around ? There are n't any bodies involved , what can you do ? " <p> " I 'm trying to tell you , are n't I ? What 's this ? " " Wait a minute , what are you doing ? " <p> " It looks so nice and pink in here . I think I 'll just touch it ... " <p> " Do n't touch anything ! " <p> " Whassa matter , do n't you like being touched ? " <p> " Not by people who are in my mind without my permission , no ! What are you doing now ? " <p> " It 's so nice here , I think I 'll just take a little nap . Catch you in a few minutes , lover . " <p> GERSTON WAS in a high state of nervous perplexity . He did n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that moment there was a violent knocking sound at the apartment door , the real one , not the virtual one . Gerston knew at once by its slightly hollow sound and over-determined air of realism that it was even more trouble coming his way . And that was really too much . <p> " I 'm busy ! " he shouted . " Go away ! " <p> " Open the door , " a voice said , " before we kick it in . This is the Thought Police . " <p> " I never heard of the Thought Police . Are you sure - " <p> " Of course I 'm sure , dummy . Open this door or we 'll break it down and kick your forehead in . " <p> " You have no right ! " Gerson cried . " It 's not legal ! " <p> " The hell it 's not ! We have a search warrant that permits us to invade your house , and another that allows us ingress to your mind . " <p> " But why are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are harboring a dangerous criminal . " <p> " In my apartment ? " <p> " Do n't play dumb with me , sucker ! You 're hiding her in your mind ! " <p> Gerston took a moment off from his panic to wonder , how could they know that ? " Do n't be silly , " he said , fighting for time , space , air . " I 'd never do that . " <p> " We know she 's in there . An alien sex criminal from a faraway planet . A sex criminal who calls herself Myra . Am I getting through to you ? Do yourself a favor , buddy . It 's probably not your fault . Let us in and we 'll get this cleared up quicklike . " <p> Gerston said , in a deadened voice , " I swear I did n't know she was a criminal . All right , come on in , officers . " <p> He unlocked the apartment door . Three bulky officers in dark blue uniforms came in . They wore silver badges on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of them wore sergeant 's stripes . <p> " Permission to enter ? " the sergeant said , tapping Gerston 's forehead with a squat forefinger . <p> " Go ahead , you 're going to do it anyway . " <p> The doors of Gerston 's mind opened . The three policemen entered in a flurry of virtual black leather jackets and calf-length jackboots . Their feet were dirty and their faces grim . They were frightening despite their virtuality . <p> " It 's too crowded , please hurry ! " Gerston cried . <p> The policemen searched through Gerston 's mind . They swept memory  --  objects off simulated shelves and knocked down the portraits of ancestors so remote that Gerston had n't known he had them . Their boots made marks on the pink scuff-sensitive surface of Gerston 's mind . Their crude remarks lingered near the virtual ceiling like clouds of ill-smelling gas . <p> " Is this going to take long ? " Gerston asked through gritted teeth . <p> " Better get used to it , " the sergeant said . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the policemen said . " I dropped one of his golf trophies . " <p> " She 's not here , " another policeman reported . " We 've searched all of the way down to the rotting depths of the stupid insanity he calls his deepest self . We 'd a found her if she 'd been hiding there . " <p> " Damnation ! " the sergeant said . " She got away again ! But at least we got you , sucker . " <p> They exited Gerston 's mind . A smile of great amusement appeared on the sergeant 's tough cop face with the little busted red veins and the tufted eyebrows . <p> Gerston opened his mouth to speak . Suddenly he froze . Everything around him was arrested in mid-motion . There was a flash of light . <p> The policemen disappeared . Gerston goggled , unable to make sense out of this . <p> And then a voice spoke in his head . <p> " Hi ! " the voice said . " We have interrupted your entry into Deep Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventures for the young at heart . Did you enjoy what you just experienced ? Want more like it ? Just signify your assent . Trained operators will pick up your inference and put the charge on your credit card . " <p> So that was what all this was , Gerston thought . This was outrageous ! <p> Aloud he said , " I demand to see someone in charge . " <p> A tall thin man with glinting spectacles appeared in his mind . <p> " Supervisor Olson at your service . Is there a problem ? " <p> " Damned well right there 's a problem ! I never chose any psychic adventure program . A little sleep was all I was after ! And even if I had selected an adventure , what right did you have to humiliate me by sending this Myra person to invade my mind ? And what was this police thing ? " <p> The supervisor said , " Let me just look at your record , sir . " <p> Swiftly he plucked a card out of Gerson 's mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , sir , we do have your assent , right here . That is your signature , is n't it ? ' <p> Gerston squinted . " It looks like it . But I never agreed to anything like this . " <p> " But you did , sir . I hope you wo n't force me to tell you when you in fact signed for the service . " <p> " Go ahead , tell me ! " <p> " It was just before you died . " <p> " I 'm dead ? " Gerston asked . <p> " That is the case , sir . " <p> " But how could I be dead ? " <p> The supervisor shrugged . " It happens . " <p> " If I 'm dead , " Gerston said , " how come I 'm still here ? " <p> " We have our ways of keeping the dead alive . " <p> " I do n't want to be dead ! " Gerston wailed . <p> " Sir , please be quiet , you 'll wake up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> But the supervisor was gone and the lights were beginning to fade . <p> Lights in his own apartment ? In his mind ? Fading ? At first he thought he was going to die . Then he remembered he was already dead . Or were they lying to him about that ? And if this was death , what lay beyond it ? And anyhow , how could he be sure he was dead ? Might this not just be the continuation of one of their dream adventures ? It would be just like them to lie to him , tell him he was dead , when actually he was just ... just ... <p> Suddenly Gerston did n't know what to think . For now something rather strange seemed to be taking place . <p>
