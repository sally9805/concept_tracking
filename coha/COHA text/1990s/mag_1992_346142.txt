TITLE : SPORTSMAN 'S PARADISE <P> AUTHOR : NANCY LEMANN <P> PUBLISHER : KNOPF ; 256 PAGES ; $20 <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : A slow , sly mint julep of a novel . <P> THEY MAY HAVE LOST THE CIVIL War , but in writing , Southerners often have a sublime authority that allows them to triumph even over thin or attenuated material . Take New Orleans-born Nancy Lemann , for example . Her new novel is very much like her first , the much praised Lives of the Saints ( 1985 ) . In that book a gently bred young woman lives out a hopeless love for a charming drunk named Claude Collier . Not much plot there , but the story is peopled with New Orleans madcaps and eccentrics who go to parties that the author describes with just the right blend of romance and wit . <P> Sportsman 's Paradise is set in the sleepy Long Island resort of Orient Point , which has been discovered by Southerners who have moved North . This time the heroine is a Collier herself , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She thinks of him as a burnt-out case  --  " courtly and windblown and stoic "  --  but in his 36 years he has been a major-league ballplayer , a New Orleans prosecutor and the foreign editor of an important New York City newspaper . What story there is gradually reveals the couple 's past affair and tells why a heartless decision made five years earlier blights any chance for happiness now . <P> The pleasures of reading Lemann lie in her sure characterization and limpid style . If she has heard of Freud , she keeps it to herself . Her people , whether brisk and dignified or drunk and disorderly , are presented as distinct personalities whose actions , however odd , are inevitable and to be accepted . Little Al , age three , is impossibly wise . Margaret , from Memphis , is more than disorderly and is locked up regularly . But she is also " a glamour girl and old-style Southern belle . " When the vignettes threaten to stretch credibility , Lemann unerringly interweaves a little writing just for its own sake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves , the waning light on the bay . . . the swans on the green lagoon . The drama of the twilight . " Such is the light in her book .
