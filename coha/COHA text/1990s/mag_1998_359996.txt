THE STRUGGLE TO BE GAY IN AMERICA <P> " As long as lawmakers put gays on a par with ' kleptomaniacs , ' the road to sexual equality will remain littered with obstacles . " ANDREW S. KAHN Philadelphia <P> What is going on ? It 's hard to imagine that in the U.S. , the most advanced country in the world , we are still faced with heinous crimes of hate like the brutal murder of Matthew Shepard , the young gay man in Wyoming NATION , Oct. 26 . We must stop killing others because they are different from us . The religious right should be embarrassed by its claims and advertisements that gays can " change " to be heterosexuals . I hope Shepard 's family knows that he was not " sick " but a victim of " sick " thinkers . SAMUEL LOUIS MORRIS Greenville , S.C . <P> On the way home from school at the age of eight , I was beaten by a grown man because I was Jewish . At 17 , at Auschwitz , I witnessed the hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others . Fifty-five years later , we have ill-disguised hatred , instigated by the religious right as well as by some of our elected representatives . How many more innocent gays and lesbians will be attacked , as was Shepard ? Sign me Jewish , gay and proud of it . GERALD B. ROSENSTEIN San Francisco <P> Anyone who condemns gays but does not condemn adultery among heterosexuals with the same zeal is a hypocrite ! This is a major double standard . SID DARDEN Penrose , Colo . <P> Christian fundamentalists claim that changing from homosexual to heterosexual is possible through adherence to Christian principles . That idea is insidious at best and a downright lie at worst . Back in the mid-1970s , I could have been the poster boy for one of those " conversions " to heterosexuality ads . I claimed I had " changed , " and even got married and fathered a son . But no matter how hard I prayed to change my sexual orientation , no matter how much I believed I could be " delivered " from the sin of homosexuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out of the closet , left behind a bitter and betrayed wife and watched my son , now 18 , struggle with his love for me and the hate he feels toward homosexuals . Unfortunately , I left destruction in my wake , but I have never felt better or healthier than I have since I came out . JAMES S. FITZGERALD Atlanta <P> The scapegoating of gay people for political gain has got to stop . To varying degrees , gay people , particularly those in their teens , face a sometimes daily barrage of harassment , intimidation and threats of physical harm . The suicide rate for gay and lesbian youth is three times the norm , making the quality of their young lives sadly obvious . Every year we receive tens of thousands of calls on our toll-free telephone hotline ( 1-888-THE-GLNH ) from people who need information , peer counseling or referrals . What happened to Shepard could happen to any of us . And someday it might . BRAD BECKER , Executive Director Gay and Lesbian National Hotline San Francisco <P> Politics or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrages right-thinking people everywhere . The sooner homosexuals come to terms with the unchangeable fact that God unequivocally disapproves of their sexual conduct and those who applaud such behavior , the sooner they will turn away from their vile degeneracy .
