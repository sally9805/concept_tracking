Throughout the 1980s and ' 90s young first-time novelists have persisted in making detachment their dominion . Those writers have created worlds in which contemporary characters speak in a passionless staccato as they find themselves ravaged not by tragedy but rather by vague ennui . <P> In her debut novel , Private Altars ( Random House ; 322 pages ; $21 ) , Katherine Mosby audaciously bucks such fashionable themes , and the result is a stunningly lyrical work of fiction . Set in the South during the 1920s and ' 30s , the novel revolves around the suffering of Vienna Daniels-a woman , Mosby writes , whose " face had the stamp of character intelligence sometimes bestows , and the look of ruined beauty . " <P> Fluent in Latin and Greek , Vienna is a Northerner who lands in the small town of Winsville to marry a man who will never appreciate her intensity or intellect . Like some fiercely independent Victorian heroines , Vienna is doomed to the life of a pariah by the narrow-mindedness of others . She is betrayed and abandoned by friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is destroyed by the death of those dearest to her . Vienna is , above all , a woman for whom brilliance and sensuality provide a painfully meager shield against the truculence of fate . <P> But Private Altars is about more than the strife Vienna is forced to endure ; it is about language . In sentence after lush sentence , Mosby is intent on showing the reader that she was primarily a poet before trying fiction . Turn to nearly any page and find an image like this , which describes Vienna 's distaste for mundane tea-table conversation : " It was as remote from her interests as the hieroglyphs spewed from the endless coiling tongue of a ticker-tape machine . " The trouble is that the accretion of similes sometimes slows the story to a maddening pace . Nevertheless , Mosby 's debut serves as a rich and accomplished antidote to the works of so many nouveau minimalists.
