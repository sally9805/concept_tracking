<p> WHEN soft-shell crabs make their annual debut in the waters off Maryland and Virginia , a tingle of anticipation runs through seafood lovers across the United States . <p> Starting about mid-May , when the water begins to warm , blue crabs emerge from their shells to give connoisseurs a seasonal gastronomic treat  --  completely edible crustaceans . <p> Blue crabs shed their shells , or molt , periodically as they grow , and for a few hours they are without their hard , protective exteriors . <p> At this stage , they can be eaten legs , body and all , except for a few parts such as the mouth and eyes , gills and apron . ( The apron is a flat , bony flap on the underside between the legs . ) <p> Crabs may outgrow and shed their shells as many as 23 times during a normal three-year life span . If left in the water , a new shell will harden again within two days . If taken out of the water , the crabs remain paper-soft and edible . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the water . <p> Americans think of soft-shell crabs as a specialty of the Chesapeake Bay , but you can catch soft-shell crabs from Long Island to Florida to the Gulf of Mexico . <p> " " The Chesapeake Bay soft-shells started showing up about two weeks ago " in Houston , said Buddy Robin of Buddy Robin Seafood Inc. on Oak Island in Trinity Bay . " " They ship quite a few soft-shells down here . " <p> The Gulf " " season " is not a standard set by the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife , Robin said . " " It all depends on weather conditions . A mild winter , and the crabs shed their shells earlier ; a hard winter , they shed their shells later . " <p> Gulf crabs molt several times a year . The first " " run " starts around the last of March and lasts through the end of May , Robin said . " " ( The fishermen ) would bring in 300 to 500 a day during the run . " Gulf crabs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  about 15 to 25 a day , he said . <p> Gulf " " red-liners , " crabs that display a red spot indicating they will molt in several days , will start showing up in Houston markets again during the September season and will last about a month , Robin said . <p> Molting signs <p> The crabs are easy to find if you know where to look and what to look for . <p> Historically , crab fishermen in the Chesapeake region have specialized in spotting the subtle color variations that indicate an ordinary blue crab is about to shed its shell to temporarily become a soft-shell crab . <p> A white sign on one swim fin indicates the crab will shed its shell in about two weeks ; a pink sign indicates it will shed in about a week ; and a red sign indicates it will shed in about three days . <p> Crab fishermen catch the crabs in pots and scrutinize each for color changes .

If left in the water for longer than about five hours , the crabs develop a " " paper shell . " These crabs are still edible , but the shells can be unpleasantly tough , rather like chewing on cellophane . <p> Shedding is a natural process that allows the crabs to grow . <p> Baby blue crabs may shed as often as every three to five days and older crabs may shed once every 20 to 50 days . <p> Unfortunately , the crabs that are shedding are also very difficult to catch . Without their shells , they 're vulnerable to the appetites of human beings , birds , turtles and other crabs . <p> Home from market <p> In the days preceding each molt , the crabs do n't eat , so they 're clean inside and do n't require any further cleansing . And as a bonus , some seafood markets and grocery stores will remove the inedible parts when you purchase the crabs . <p> Houston-area markets sell soft-shell crabs for $ 3-$ 3.50 each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on size . One crab per person is sufficient for an appetizer portion ; two to three crabs is ample for a dinner portion . <p> Dave Ankeny , manager of Lombardi 's Seafood in Winter Park , Fla. , said it 's best to buy the crabs the day you plan to eat them . <p> However , they can be stored in the refrigerator for two to three days before cooking . <p> If you 're not sure when you will cook your catch , it 's best to shop for frozen soft-shell crabs . These are cleaned , individually quick-frozen and vacuum-packed in molded containers to prevent breakage . The frozen variety are usually available year-round . <p> A very good year <p> Thanks to fine weather and smooth seas in the Chesapeake Bay region  --  the epicenter of the American soft-shell crab industry  - -  1993 promises to be a blue-ribbon year for soft blue crabs . Last year , rain , wind and cold weather dampened the season and shrank the catch . <p> Robin said Seadrift , Texas , produced a good supply of soft-shell crabs this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fall molting season should be a different story . <p> " " There 's a good supply of salt water now in Galveston Bay . " <p> It is n't just the lack of shell that makes soft-shell crabs such a delectable treat . The meat is exceptionally sweet and flavorful , especially when sauteed in a little butter until the outside is golden crisp . <p> Around the Chesapeake Bay , fried soft-shell crab sandwiches are a favorite snack food served at fund-raising events and county fairs . <p> Restaurants serve fancier presentations that call for flavoring the crabs with almonds , lemon-butter , raspberry vinegar or garlic . River Oaks Grill , 2630 Westheimer , lightly coats the soft-shell crabs in a flour-and-egg mixture then quickly pan fries them in a hot skillet to a golden crunch . The crabs are served with a variety of vegetable accompaniments . <p> At home , cooks can grill , broil or steam the delicate crustaceans and serve them with tartar sauce , cocktail sauce or herb-spiked mayonnaise . <p> There are only two tricks to making perfect soft-shell crabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Nelda DiLauro of Handy Soft-Shell Crabs , a Maryland company that has harvested soft-shell crabs since 1917 . <p> About 5 to 6 minutes total cooking time is all the delicate crustaceans require . They 're done when the meat turns white and opaque . The outside should be crispy and the body should be firm to the touch . <p> If the body feels spongy when pressed lightly with the fingertips , cook the crabs 1 to 2 minutes longer . <p> Avoid cooking the crabs in the microwave oven , which can toughen the meat and leave the thin shell soggy and unappealing . <p> Neophyte crab cooks often make the error of smothering the natural flavor under heavy sauces or overpowering spices . Instead , cook the crabs with simple ingredients that enhance rather than hide the sweetness , DiLauro said . <p> Complementary seasonings include butter , olive oil , lemon juice , garlic , a Cajun spice blend ( if not too spicy or salty ) , fresh chopped tomatoes or a mild curry mixture . <p> Recipes that accompany this story may be viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raspberry Butter Soft-Shell Crab Sandwich Almondine . <p> Almond Mayonnaise . <p> Sauteed Soft-Shell Crabs With Garlic , Pine Nuts and Tomatoes .
