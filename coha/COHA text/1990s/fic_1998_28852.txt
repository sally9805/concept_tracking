Nobody noticed him . Not Wendy Culligan , who was too busy pitching million-dollar condos to a half-dozen Japanese businessmen more interested in her rear than in residences . Still , she patiently went about her spiel , talking about in-house services , drop-dead views , revolving mortgages , and great resale values . Leaning over the table , showing a touch of cleavage while spearing a jumbo shrimp off the seafood appetizer plate . Along with the prawns were oysters , abalone , gravlax , and raw sea-urchin sashimi , the last item a big hit with the Asians -- something about making them potent . Men -- regardless of race , creed , or color -- thought only about sex . And here she was , trying to earn an honest buck while they popped squiggly things into their mouths , washing the tidbits down with sake as they licked their lips suggestively . What 's a poor working girl to do ? Inwardly , Wendy acknowledged that Brenda , her boss , had been generous in arranging the dinner at Estelle 's . The restaurant was exquisite -- all silver and crystal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined with elegant sky-blue Oriental silk screens . Exotic flower arrangements adorned every table -- giant lilies , imported orchids , and two-tone roses . A hint of perfume , but never overwhelming . The chairs were not only upholstered in silky fabric but comfortable as well . Even the bar area was posh -- plush stools , smoked mirrors , and rich walnut panels , all tastefully illuminated with Tivoli lights . She felt as if she were dining in a palace , wondered why Princess Di divorced her meal ticket . So what if Prince Charles had someone on the side , wishing himself to be a Tampax up her you-know-where . ( What a weirdo ! ) Wendy could have withstood the pain just so long as the Queen had kept those pounds and pence rolling in . Transfixed by the splendid surroundings , so intent on doing her job -- getting a fat and much-needed commission -- Wendy did n't blink an eye when the young man with the green sport coat walked through the door , eyeing the room with coldness and calculation . Neither did Linda or Ray Garrison . At last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-five years . Recalling the anniversary party that their daughter , Jeanine , had thrown for them even if she had thrown it with his money . At least it had gone well . Jeanine was one hell of an organizer . The guests had remarked what a wonderful party it was , what magnificent parents he and Linda must have been to have raised two such devoted children ... politely including David in the same category as Jeanine . No one had dared to hint at his son 's recent jail term . An elegant affair . But Ray knew it had been just as much for Jeanine as it had been for Linda and him . Lots of her " club " friends -- people Ray barely knew -- had come along for the ride . Still , it had been fun . And David had behaved himself . At last , the boy finally seemed to be moving in the right direction , was using his God-given talents . Ray would have disinherited him years ago , but it had been Linda 's soft heart that had kept the avenues of communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solid , his backbone for three and a half decades . At times , he was aware of the age in her face , the webbing around the corners of her eyes and mouth , the gentle drop of her jaw and cheeks . But Linda 's imperfections , completely absent in her youth , only served to increase his desire for her . He loved her with all his heart . And he knew that she returned the sentiment . At times , their closeness seemed to exclude everyone else , including their children . Maybe that was why David had grown up so resentful . But more than likely , their love for one another had nothing to do with their son 's problems . Weak-willed and cursed with talent and charm , Dave had drifted into a Bohemian life at an early age . But why think about that now ? Ray reprimanded himself . Why think about Jeanine -- her spending habits , her high-strung hysteria , and her fits of temper when she did n't get what she wanted ? Why think about David 's repeated stabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely wife . Ray took his own advice and reserved his remaining attention for Linda . Although his eyes did sweep over the young , grave-faced man in the green jacket , holding a drink , they failed to take him in . Even if Walter Skinner had noticed the odd man , he would n't give the punk the time of day . At this stage in his life , Walter had no patience for youngsters , no patience for anyone . He had worked in Hollywood for over fifty years , had earned himself a fat bank account and a modicum of recognition and respect . He wanted what he wanted when he wanted it with no questions asked . If you did n't like it , you could take a long walk to China . And what Walter wanted now was the young lady sitting across from him . A lovely lass with big , red hair , and long shapely legs that melded into a firm , round ass that sent his juices flowing . Not here , Walter scolded himself . To calm himself down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerant woman . Once she had been a beautiful woman , a Vegas dancer right after Bugsy had turned the desert sands into dunes of gold . Walter had chased her , pursued her relentlessly . Finally , she gave in . For her , it had paid off . As a minimally talented show girl , Adelaide had been destined for obscurity . Instead , she became a Hollywood wife . He gave her status . money , and a role she could have for life . If she was willing to indulge him from time to time . Which she did gracefully . Good old Addie . As steady as the old gray mare . Walter looked across the table , through the diamond-cut stemware . Good grade Waterford . Estelle had done it up nicely . Elegant without being pompous . And good food . No wonder the place was always jammed . He 'd had doubts about bringing Big Hair here . She had dolled up for the occasion , and much to Walter 's surprise , she had pulled it off without looking cheap . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded back . Ah , recognition . It was sweet . However , it was not quite as sweet as Big Hair 's ass . Walter looked deeply into his table companion 's baby blues , his eyes shifting downward to her superb surgically designed chest . He felt a tug in his pants and that was wonderful . At seventy-eight , no hard-on was ever taken for granted . Face it , Walter said to himself . At seventy-eight , waking up in the morning was a cause for celebration . So enamored of his sexual response and his beating heart , Walter did n't think about the serious young man leaning against the bar , his eyes as chilled as the drink he was nursing . Carol Anger did glance at the thin young man in the green coat , thinking he looked familiar . She could n't quite place him . A face that had changed and had changed again . But she could n't dwell on it because she was too busy . Gretchen had called in sick and Carol was running double shift . On her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked the party of sweet-sixteeners in the corner . Eight giggly girls trying to pretend they were grown-ups , decked out in sophisticated suits and too much makeup . Like she had been at sixteen -- sans the suits and jewelry of course . She had grown up in a home where money had always been tight . But down deep , all sixteen-year-old girls were the same . Where had the time gone ? At first , right after her divorce , her life had been a blur of tears . Tears of fury at her ex , tears of gratitude at her parents for their love and understanding . And their help . Mom had come through . Always there when Carol needed her . Saying she 'd take care of Billy so Carol could go back to nursing school . Carol had insisted on doing her fair share . Hence the job ... this job . And it was a doozy . She had Olaf to thank for that . She had met him at a bar , had laughed when he had told her his name . OLAF ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she laughed . Which of course had made her feel terrible . Olaf had come to America to be a cook . When he told her he worked at Estelle 's , she had nearly fainted . You 're not a cook , she had chided . You 're a chef ! Within a month , Olaf had convinced Estelle to give Carol a job interview . A week later , she was dressed in a tux and ready to work . How she loved Olaf , with his half smile , his stoic manner , and his thick upper lip that was often dotted with sweat from the heat of the kitchen . She had often wondered how she could have been so upset over her failed marriage , since from it came all this good fortune . So occupied by her fate and work , Carol failed to see the thin young man 's mouth turn into a twisted smile , his eyes as blank as snowdrifts . Ken Wetzel did n't think twice about him . He was too busy slurping up oysters while giving his wife the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible but it was n't coming out right . It was n't that he did n't love Tess . He guessed he still did . She had been there for him , was still a decent wife , a good mother , and a passable lover . Unfortunately , she just did n't fit into his world anymore . Especially since he had been promoted to assistant vice president . He needed a partner who was more dynamic , not some ordinary woman whose sole occupation was raising children . Granted , the kids were good kids ... Tess 's doing . But that was n't enough anymore . A woman had to know things -- how to dress , how to smile , how to make conversation about the vagaries of the market . A woman like that could help him get ahead . Trouble was , Tess was holding him back . A great gal , but a high-school dropout . And with the last kid , she had gotten heavy . Those awful tents she wore . Why did the prints always have to be so garish ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleek in a plain black suit ? That was Tess . Ken sighed inwardly , wishing she 'd wipe the tears off her cheeks . Because she was embarrassing him . He closed his eyes for a moment , allowing himself a brief fantasy of Sherrie . Sherrie , with her milky eyes , her sensuous mouth , her wonderful hips , her full breasts , and her MBA from Stanford . They had met on interoffice E-mail , she being in marketing , he being two floors up in stock research . He joked that it had been love at first byte . The affair was almost immediate , fueled by the thrill of their respective infidelities and what each one could do for the other 's career . Yes , Ken still loved Tess on some level . And yes , Ken still cared for the kids . But life was about reaching one 's potential . The marriage just would n't work any longer . Times change , he had told her . Life changes . You move on . With each pronouncement , Tess had shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evening did little to quell his appetite . As much as he hated himself , he had to admit that telling Tess it was over was a definite high . The exhilaration of liberation . Flying high with freedom , Ken paid no attention to the thin young man . Not even when the young man 's face fell flat , turning his physiognomy into something inanimate , his eyes as murky as pond water . No one even noticed when he reached into the pocket of his green jacket . Not until he pulled out a gun and the lead began to fly . But by then , it was too late . CHAPTER TWO A microsecond flash of yesteryear as images too frighteningly clear burst from the hidden recesses of Decker 's brain . A familiar scene with familiar sounds and smells . Charlie 's discards . Twisted corpses . Moans of the wounded echoing through a gripping fog of panic . Medics worked frantically , hands and arms bathed in blood and flesh . The metallic odor of spilled blood mixed with the stink of emptied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It destroyed faith in a hand clap . Decker swallowed , trying to lubricate a parched throat . Rationally , he knew Nam was over . So what was this ? An instant replay ? Except the surroundings were off . Confusion reigned . But only for a moment . Because there was work to be done . Instantly , he rolled up his jacket and shirt sleeves , gloved his hands . Saw a woman whose leg had been turned into Swiss cheese by dime-sized bullet holes . Lying in a pool of crimson . Her complexion pasty ... clammy . Pushing aside debris with his foot , Decker made room for himself ... knelt at her side . Stop the bleeding , treat ' em for shock , get ' em to a chopper . Scratch the chopper , make it an ambulance . " You 're going to be all right , " Decker spoke soothingly as he worked . Perspiration had soaked through his jacket from his armpits . His crotch was as hot and humid as an Orlando summer Sweat was dripping off his hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his patient , shook off the water like a drooling mastiff . He said , " Just hang in there . " Lots of bleeding , some of it arterial . Rhythmic squirts of bright red blood . Decker put pressure on the leaking area as the woman screamed , tears rolling down her cheeks . He bit his upper lip , nibbling on his ginger mustache , trying to keep his own breathing slow and steady . He examined her torn tissue , working through bits of bone . Femoral artery appeared to be intact ... the other major arteries as well . Arteriole bleeding , probably from one of their branches . She did n't realize it , but she had been a very lucky pup . Much better than her male companion , who 'd never again see the light of day . " I need a blanket , STAT ! " Decker shouted . " We 're out ! " someone shouted back . " Then get me a tablecloth , napkins ... something ! " Decker screamed back . " I got shock settling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it yourself ! " " For Chrissakes --  " " Here ! " A tiny female paramedic with green eyes threw Decker a tablecloth . She was bent over a bearded man , wrapping a bandage around his neck . Instantly , the starched white linen turned tomato-colored . Her eyes glanced at Decker , at his shoulder holster peeking out from under his jacket . " What ambulance company are you from ? " " LAPD . Lieutenant Peter Decker . " The paramedic raised her brows . " Celia Brown . Need anything , just ask . " " Thanks . " Spreading out the tablecloth as best he could . Decker raised the woman 's good leg , dabbing her forehead and face as she sobbed and spoke . She told him her name was Tess . She had heard popping noises . Then everyone had started screaming , running for cover . Her leg exploded as she dived under her table . Taking mental notes . The victim wore a thick gold chain around her neck ; her purse was still at her side . A horrific crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or maybe the gunman just did n't bother with her . She was n't decked in diamonds and pearls , not like some of the other patrons . She wore a loud print dress that appeared to be a couple of sizes too big for her body . She asked Decker if her leg was still there . She could n't wiggle her toes . All she felt were throbs of agony . " Your leg is there . " Again Decker checked for bleeding . " You 're doing great . " " My husband ... " Decker was quiet . " He 's dead ? " Again there was silence . " I want to know , " Tess whispered . Decker took a deep breath . " The dark-haired man wearing a blue serge suit ? " " Yes . " " I 'm sorry , ma'am . He 's gone . " Tess said nothing , looked away with tears in her eyes . " Just keep as still as you can . " To the paramedic , Decker said , " Got any spare wound gel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some equipment . " You need a shot of coagulant ? " " Bleeding 's subsided . Besides , I 'd prefer if one of you administered the meds . " " Fine . " Celia thought a moment , then said , " You 're a lieutenant ... as in a cop ? " " Yes . " " Calling in the big shots for this one . " Muted by the enormity of destruction , Decker could n't make chitchat . Celia said , " They must be training you guys pretty well in ER services . " " I was a medic in the army . " Ah , now it makes sense . Vietnam ? " " Yes . " " Betcha had lots of experience . " Too much , Decker thought . He applied the salves , unfurled a roll of gauze . " She 's going to need a neck brace and a hip and leg splint . Can you finish her up for me when you 're done ? " " No problem . Thanks for helping . We need it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with her man and his bloodied neck , she yelled out . " Gurney and transport . " Within seconds , she ungloved and regloved . Walked on her knees over to Decker 's patient . " Unbelievable . " " Truly . " " I 'll finish her up now . " " Thanks . Her name is Tess . She 's doing great . " " Hey , Tess , " the paramedic said . " We 're taking good care of you . " Decker stood . A dozen doctors charged through the door , scattering themselves about where needed . Trampling on evidence . As if that were important at the moment . But down the line it would make his job harder . As yet , no one was in charge . Since there seemed to be enough medical staff , he figured he might as well take control . He called over some officers , flashed his badge . " We need to secure the area . I want a fifty-yard radius around the place , two officers stationed at every entrance . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed out unless it 's medical personel or Homicide detectives . And I mean no one . Not even survivors of this mayhem may leave until it 's cleared with me . As hard as it will be , do n't let in any family members . Be polite and sympathetic , but firm . Tell them I 'll come out , speak to them , tell them what 's going on . I 'll inform them of ... of their loved ones ' conditions just as soon as we make identifications . Certainly no one from the press corps will be permitted on the premises . If they start asking questions -- which they will -- tell them someone from the department will hold a conference later . Reporters who break the rules get arrested . Go . " From the middle of the restaurant , Decker surveyed the room -- the disheveled tables , the knocked-over chairs , the pocked walls . and shattered window glass . Graceful wallpaper had been turned into Rorschachs of blood and food , gleaming parquet-wood floors were now deadly seas of spilled fluids , broken crystal , and pottery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen doors , the hallway leading to the rest rooms , the windows , and the front entrance . He took out a notebook , began dividing the area into grids . He heard someone call his name -- or rather , his rank . He turned around , waved Oliver over . " I think I 'm going to throw up , " the detective said . Decker regarded him . Scott Oliver 's naturally dark complexion had paled even through his six o'clock shadow ; his normally wise-ass eyes were filled with dread . " We 've got to ID the dead . " Decker ran a hand through sweat-soaked , pumpkin-colored hair . " Let 's start a purse and pocket search . " He showed Oliver his sketch . " I 'll take the left side , you do the right . When the rest of the team comes in , we 'll divide up the room accordingly . " " There 's Marge . " Oliver beckoned her near with frantic hand gestures . She arrived ashen and shaking , her shoulders hunched , taking a good inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She touched her mouth with trembling fingers , then pushed thin blond hair off her face . " What happened ? Someone just started shooting ? " Oliver shrugged ignorance . " We 're doing a pocket and purse search for ID of the dead . Loo , what about interviewing the survivors ? " Decker said , " Scott , you do the search . Marge , you start interviewing on Scott 's side -- Bert , over here ! " Martinez pivoted , jogged over to his team . " Mary Mother of God , I think I 'm gon na be sick . " " Take a deep breath , " Decker said . " Bathrooms are in the back . " Martinez covered his face with his hands , inhaled , then let it out slowly . " It 's just the putrid smell . Actually , it 's ... everything , God , I 'm ... " No one spoke . Then Decker said , " Scott and Marge are working the right side . You work with me on the left . " " Doing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black mustache . " Interviewing the survivors or IDing the dead . Take your pick . " " I 'll do the survivors , " Martinez said . " Tom 's on his way . You heard from Farrell ? " " Got hold of his wife . He 's coming down . " " Think that 's a good idea , Loo ? Man 's got a heart condition . " " Gaynor 's survived close to thirty years on the force , he 'll survive this . Besides , he 's a wonder at detail work ... which is what we 're going to need ... lots of detail work . " " And the captain ? " " He was at a meeting in Van Nuys when this went down . Should be here momentarily . " Decker started in the far left corner of the room , at a large round table for twelve . Two Asian men lay crumpled and unattended on the floor , spangled with bits of china and slivers of crystal . Loose flowers had fallen upon their torsos as if marking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About fifty feet away sat a huddle of business-suited Asians males . Nearby were two Caucasians -- one female and one male wrapped in blankets and bandages . He nodded to the woman , she nodded back . Her hands and face appeared cat-scratched , probably scored by flying glass . Decker shook off anxiety , gloved , and carefully kneeled down . He checked the bodies ' pulses . Nothing . He went through one of the men 's pants pockets . A portly man shot several times in the face and chest . He pulled out a wallet . Carefully , he wrote down the deceased 's vitals from his driver 's license . Hidai Takamine from Encino . Black hair , brown eyes , married , and forty-six years old . Decker winced . His own age . He glanced up . Martinez had n't moved , was looking down , staring at the bodies with vacant eyes . Gently , Decker prodded him . " Get to work , Bert . " Martinez blinked rapidly . He said , " You in Nam , Loo ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Decker said , " Sixty-nine to seventy-one . " Silence . Martinez took a swipe at his eyes , then got to work . * By the time Strapp showed up , Decker had finished identifying the bodies on his side of the restaurant . The captain had given up the pretense of maintaining a calm demeanor . His thin features were screwed up in anger , his complexion wan . Decker brought him up to date as Strapp tapped his toes , his right hand balled into a fist that continuously pounded his left palm . " Seven dead on my side . " Decker rolled his massive shoulders , stretched his oversized legs as his kneecaps made popping sounds . The bending was doing wonders for his floating patellas . " I 've identified the victims from driver 's licenses . I 'll go out and inform the next of kin just as soon as I get a body count and names from the other side . " He looked around , saw that Tom Webster and Farrell Gaynor had arrived . Tom was interviewing survivors along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpses on the right side as Marge and Scott attempted to calm the distraught . Strapp shook his head , mumbled something . " Sir ? " Decker asked . " Nothing , " Strapp said . " Just cursing to myself . At last count , there 's something like twenty-eight over at Valley Memorial 's ER . This is just ... I 've got a slew of shrinks outside for support groups ... some ER docs as well ... in case someone has a heart attack or faints when the news hits . " " Shall I do it now , Captain ? " Strapp was still hitting his palm with his fist . " We 'll do the dirty work together . " " What about the press ? " " Okay , okay . " Strapp started bouncing on his toes . " You handle the press , I stay with the family members . Keep the vultures behind the ropes . No announcements until I 've finished dealing with the next of kin . " Decker said , " Here 's a partial list of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as I can . " Both of them stalled for a moment ; then they went their separate ways .
