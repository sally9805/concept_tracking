Eight years after the heart-bypass operation that saved his life , Floyd Stokes was in deep trouble again . His angina had returned with a vengeance . He was gulping nitroglycerine tablets and was virtually incapacitated , unable to do simple chores on his Seminole , Texas , ranch . Too far gone for another bypass , he had a choice , as he puts it , of " just waiting for death or trying to do something about it . " <P> Stokes chose to survive . He volunteered to take part in a novel clinical trial about to be conducted on heart patients by Dr. Jeffrey Isner at the St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Boston . To his surprise , he was accepted . Last May he flew to Boston , where a solution containing billions of copies of a gene that triggers blood-vessel growth was injected directly into his heart . <P> Within three weeks , Stokes was feeling better and now , at 58 , he is back at work on a normal , nitroglycerine-free routine . " I ride horses and I run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in pretty good shape to do what I do . " As it turned out , all 16 heart patients in Isner 's trial showed improvement , and six are entirely free of pain . <P> The St. Elizabeth clinical trial is one of some 300 similar types of procedures being performed today on more than 3,000 patients around the world . These numbers reflect a growing optimism that gene therapy , a medical discipline that emerged with great fanfare in the early 1990s but fell out of favor during its adolescence , is finally coming of age . " Twenty years from now gene therapy will have revolutionized the practice of medicine , " predicts Dr. W. French Anderson , director of gene therapy at the University of Southern California medical school , who is perhaps the most outspoken champion of this slowly maturing medical art . " Virtually every disease will have gene therapy as one of its treatments . " <P> Gene therapy , simply defined , is the placement of beneficial genes into the cells of patients . By introducing the gene and consequently the protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Salk Institute in La Jolla , Calif. , " you either eliminate the defect , ameliorate the defect , slow down the progression of the disease or in some way interfere with the disease . " <P> The initial goals of gene therapists were to cure relatively straightforward genetic disorders , such as Huntington 's disease and sickle-cell anemia , that are caused by a single defective gene . The strategy was simple : substitute a normal gene for a faulty one . But scientists quickly realized that adding genes to cells could also impart new functions to those cells . That may lead to the genetic treatment of a host of other disorders , including heart disease and many forms of cancer . <P> But how do you get a new gene into the nucleus of a cell ? The trick , researchers discovered early on , is to take advantage of the infectious power of viruses ; burrowing into cells is second nature to them . A virus is nothing more than a tiny strip of DNA or RNA crammed into a protein envelope . Using the tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deleting some or all of its genes , splicing the therapeutic gene into the remaining genetic material and , in a laboratory Petri dish , mixing it with human cells . The altered virus , now called a carrier or vector , can deliver the therapeutic gene into the nucleus with great dispatch .
