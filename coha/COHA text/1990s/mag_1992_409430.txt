Did you know that some of today 's most wonderfully accurate rifle barrels are being rifled by a process almost identical to the one in use when Columbus discovered America ? History books do n't tell us the time , the place or even the name of the wizard who first cut spiraling grooves into the walls of a gun barrel , but we do know that it happened about 500 years ago  --  probably somewhere in the Austrian Empire  --  and we also have a pretty clear description of how that rifling was cut . What is not so clear , however , is why it was cut . Who knew that if a bullet spins around its forward axis it will be more accurate than one that does n't ? Gyroscopic ability was known then ; after all , people had been spinning tops thousands of years before . So we can suppose that some clever gunsmith made the mental leap of linking bullets with tops . Earliest written records , however , obviously set down by the Great Granddaddy of all gun writers , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mischievous devils riding bullets and causing them to go crooked . By making the balls spin , the devils were thrown off and the bullets flew true . Among the reasons why we have such a clear description of how early barrels were rifled is that the tools and machinery used to cut rifling grooves have survived . Back during my college days I earned tuition and bread by making replicas of " Kentucky " - style long rifles . Once or twice I tried rifling a four-foot-long barrel using a hand-powered tool that had been built at least a century before . Basically , as I pulled the tool handle , I dragged a single cutting blade that made a single , thin scratch of a cut through the barrel . The blade was fastened to a rod , which was attached to a screw-like rifling guide that turned the cutter . Those barrels had seven grooves , and it took about 100 passes of the blade to cut each groove to full depth . Because each pull of the tool handle required two steps back and two forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifling a single barrel . This is one reason I decided it was wiser to buy barrels already rifled . The other reason was that my barrels were n't very accurate . ( Maybe the devils got in ' em . ) Since that time , I 've visited dozens of tool and firearms museums the world over , and I never cease being amazed at the similarities between antique rifling machines . No matter where they were made , or during which era , their mode of operation is basically the same . Most amazing of all , though , are the similarities between the machinery being used to cut rifling today and that of centuries ago . Today 's machinery is bigger , of course , built of heavy steel , powered by motors and automatically indexed so that the cutting blade or hook passes from one groove to the next without being hand set ; but still the grooves are being cut one thin slice at a time . Gunsmiths who were rifling barrels when Columbus set sail would probably recognize a modern machine for exactly what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a " modern " machine for cutting rifling . Virtually all major gunmakers have abandoned the time-consuming cut-rifling process in favor of faster methods . If you own a rifle made before World War II , you can be sure that the rifling got there by the cut method . After 1960 , virtually all production-grade rifles were rifled by another process : button or hammer forging . The years in between were a time of transition for the gun industry . As the cut process was abandoned by government arsenals and commercial industry , the surplus machinery  --  some of which dated back to World War I or even earlier  --  was bought up by individual craftsmen who rebuilt or modified it for their own use . Thus , the tradition of actually cutting rifling into the walls of a barrel continued . In light of more modern and faster ways of rifling barrels , this may seem archaic ; but do n't argue with the results . There are those who claim that cut rifling is still the most accurate , and they back up their claims with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cut rifling , as was Jack O'Connor 's favorite barrelmaker , Bill Sukalle . By the time I arrived on the shooting scene , Bill Atkinson of the old A &M; Gun Works was cutting rifling that set world records for accuracy . Today , barrelmakers Tom Houghton ( H &H; Precision ) , Boots Obermeyer , Paul Marquart , John Krieger , Mark Chanlynn ( Rocky Mountain Rifle Works ) , to name a few , still rifle barrels by the cut system . If you keep up with championship-level shooting at Camp Perry and the ultra-accurate game of benchrest , you will see some of these names in the winning-equipment listings on a regular basis . Interestingly , rifling can be cut with such dimensional precision that barrels rifled this way are still preferred for most ballistic laboratory testing . There are four basic methods of rifling currently in widespread use : the cut method I 've just talked about , the button and hammer forging processes , which I 'll discuss later , and the broaching technique . You wo n't hear of broached rifling in connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 20mm cannon , but it is the most often used rifling system for centerfire handguns . Basically , a broach is a tool with multiple cutting edges that completely cuts all the rifling grooves at one time . It is extremely fast , and if the broach is properly sharpened , the method produces excellent results . The poor accuracy of some handguns can usually be traced to causes other than the guns ' broached barrels . The time it takes to broach-rifle a handgun barrel is about the same as it takes to read this sentence . The concept of button rifling is simplicity itself , but in actual practice the process is somewhat complex . After the bar of barrel steel is drilled and then reamed to a smooth , uniform size , a super-hard button is inserted and either pushed or pulled through the length of the bore . The tight-fitting button is ringed with ridges that press into the wall of the bore , forming the customary spiraling grooves of rifling . As the button is forced through the bore , it does not actually cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the walls of the bore . Some barrelmakers dimension their buttons so that the total volume of displaced steel is pushed outward , whereas others allow for the displaced metal to flow laterally and be molded into part of the lands . As you would imagine , it takes a lot of power to force a button through an undersize hole in a bar of barrel steel . That is why the job requires hefty hydraulic presses delivering tons of pressure . Depending on the equipment , a button 's journey through a bore will take about three to six minutes . Some barrelmakers use a system that guides the rate of turn of the button as it passes through the bore , whereas others allow the button to float , or turn freely , following the trail made by the angle of its own lands and grooves . The rate of twist of this system is established simply by the angle at which the grooves are cut on the button . When the button emerges it leaves a slick , fully rifled bore ; but depending on the barrelmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the button shoulders its way through the resisting steel it leaves a wake of stresses in the barrel that , if not controlled , can do some very ugly things to accuracy . This is why some makers , but not all , heat treat their barrels to remove these internal forces , leaving the barrel docile and ready for turning to shape and final fitting . The crowning touch on some button-rifled barrels is a final hand-lapping , which erases the surface etching left by some button-lubricating methods ( especially with stainless steel , which further explains why custom stainless barrels are more expensive ) and further refines internal dimensions and finish . Accuracy notwithstanding , the appeal of button rifling to the mass manufacturer was speed . Not only was the speedy thrust of a button much faster than the time consuming cut system , but it speeded other processes , as well . It meant that the time spent reaming and polishing a drilled hole prior to rifling could be minimized because the button tended to iron out tool marks and flatten dimensional irregularities , making the finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button process was adopted by a large percentage of gunmakers the world over . In fact , the button process became so successful and widely used that it looked like it was here to stay . But even in an industry as plodding and hidebound as gun making there is always someone looking for faster , easier and cheaper ways to make things . That faster way of making barrels is what has come to be known as hammer forging . The " hammer forging " way of rifling barrels was brought to the attention of American shooters by no less a promoter than Roy Weatherby . Back in the late 1950s , when he introduced his Mark V rifle , one of Weatherby 's promotional gambits was that his German-made rifles were fitted with barrels made by a revolutionary process known as hammer forging . With the process also known at the time as roto-forging and cold swaging , I 'm inclined to suspect that the name " hammer forging " was coined by Weatherby himself . It certainly bears the stamp of his " he-man " marketing genius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process . Here 's how it works : Imagine that you have a piece of modeling clay about the size and shape of a doughnut . Put this doughnut over a finger and begin to kneed and squeeze the clay until it forms a tube covering the length of the finger . Now withdraw your finger , and you 'll get a pretty good idea of how hammer-forged barrels are made  --  not only have the external shape and dimensions been transformed , but the hole inside is a reverse image of your finger . Had , in fact , your finger been shaped in the form of reverse rifling , that image would have been transmitted to the clay . Now that you have the idea of how it works , simply picture a thick tube of steel being squeezed over a mandrel shaped like reverse rifling . When the mandrel is withdrawn , the inside of the tube is fully rifled . Hammer forging can do a lot more than just form rifling , because as the rifling is being formed , the barrel 's external contour can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it comes from the machine is n't round and smooth , but rather , patterned with the imprints of hundreds of machine strokes . Most manufacturers final-turn the barrel 's outside surface to traditional smooth roundness , but when the new-era Mannlicher rifles were introduced back in the late 1960s , the manufacturer opted not to remove the hammer forging signature from its barrels . Not only does this save money , but also the swirling , faceted-pattern barrel finish has become something of a trademark of modern Mannlicher sporting rifles . Now you know how the unusual pattern gets there . And by the way , the giant Austrian firm of Steyr , maker of Mannlicher guns , is also a leading manufacturer of hammer-forging machinery . So who uses hammer-forged barrels and how good are they ? Remington , Ruger , Weatherby and Winchester use hammer-forged barrels for all or part of their centerfire and rimfire rifle barrel production ; and in Europe the process is used by virtually all high-production major gunmakers . The best hammer-forged barrels are very accurate indeed . If you own a tack-driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of its accuracy to the hammer-forged barrel . I 've also found these barrels able to retain their accurate qualities for some time , upholding the claim that hammer-forging surface hardens a rifle 's bore and reduces the rate of erosion . So where do we go from here ? What are the frontiers of barrel-making technology ? There are several . One is an electro-chemical process that has the potential of cutting and finishing steel with molecular precision and smoothness . And , of course , laser machining also has potential . Or will steel itself become obsolete , rendering also obsolete everything we think we know about building better barrels ? Ceramic technology is the buzzword of modern industry , being suggested  --  and already used  --  for everything from spaceships to train rails . A ceramic barrel , or a ceramic coating , would greatly reduce  --  or even eliminate  --  erosion and the other afflictions to which steel is heir . Imagine a barrel that would wear forever , never rusting or needing cleaning . We need not look too far into the future to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the present it is still mighty satisfying to own a beautifully rifled barrel and to marvel at the way those lands and grooves make it possible to reach out and touch a deer or elk . As the late Bill Bowman said in 1955 about his new varmint rig , " It 's got one of them new Douglas barrels that will kill a groundhog farther than I can point . " <p>
