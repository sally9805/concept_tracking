<p> Getting away from it all is getting to be a bit of a challenge on the Front Range these days , thanks to the population boom . Hiking trails that used to be as empty as a saloon on Sunday morning are becoming as busy as a bank on the first of the month . <p> Still , folks who want to spend the day on foot can find places that offer plenty of solitude and serenity if they know where and when to go . <p> " If you go to certain areas , you 're always going to be thronged , " observed Sasha Charney , a trails planner for the Colorado Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation . " But if you look around , even in Rocky Mountain National Park , you can find places that are just as nice where you 'll hardly see anybody . " <p> One problem , of course , is that publicizing these kinds of destinations - as Backpacker magazine has recently learned - makes them better known and thus more crowded . Hence outdoor enthusiasts who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often about as happy to do so as anglers are to reveal their favorite fishing spots . <p> " With the growth from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs , there is no place where you 're not going to see people , " said Cleve Dixon , a Colorado native who handles canoeing and cross-country ski sales for Recreational Equipment Inc. in Denver . " And not to be rude about it , " he added , half-seriously , " but if I knew that such a spot existed , I surely would n't tell someone who 'd put it in the newspaper . " <p> It 's with some trepidation , therefore , that the following selection of paths " less traveled by " is offered . Presumably , the list will invite residents and tourists alike to sample some new venues for recreation , and in the process help take the pressure off the more popular locations . <p> 1 . Maxwell Falls . This 3-mile trail near Evergreen , used mainly by locals up to now , leads gently uphill to a scenic cascade in Arapaho National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiffany Ellis , an environmental interpreter at the visitor center in Idaho Springs . " The falls have lots of rock , so you can climb around in there . There also are good birds and good flowers right now . " <p> Drive south from the center of Evergreen about 1 mile on Colorado 73 , then west on Brook Forest Road about 4 miles to a dirt pullout on the left near a concrete dam at Stevenson Reservoir . The trail starts at an elevation of 7,800 feet and rises to about 8,300 . <p> 2 . Evergreen Mountain . This 7-mile loop trail goes up and down the north side of Evergreen Mountain , whose 8,536-foot summit boasts good views of Mount Evans and Pikes Peak , as well as a small stand of old-growth Douglas fir and Ponderosa pine trees . " It 's kind of off the beaten path , " said Randy Frank , a natural resources specialist for the Jefferson County Open Space program , which manages the area as part of the Alderfer-Three Sisters Park . <p> Go south of Evergreen about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road about 1.5 miles to the trailhead with rest rooms . Parking is also available at Wilmot Elementary School on non-school days . <p> 3 . Chicago Lakes . This 5-mile wilderness trail west of Evergreen and south of Idaho Springs goes from Echo Lake into a spectacular valley at the northern foot of Mount Evans , starting at an elevation of 10,500 feet and ending around 12,000 . The trail sees relatively few visitors because it drops a rocky 500 feet in the first mile ( meaning hikers must climb back up on the return trip ) and because the trailhead is in an obscure location near the campground across the road from Echo Lake Lodge . <p> The trail is also reachable via the Idaho Springs Reservoir road , which leaves Colorado 103 a couple of miles downhill and northwest of Echo Lake . This route used to be open to automobiles but is now gated and open only to pedestrians . The road meets the trail at the national forest boundary about a mile from the highway . <p> 4 . Grizzly Gulch . This high-alpine area west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interstate 70 is much less busy than neighboring Stevens Gulch , which serves as a gateway to Grays and Torreys Peaks , the 14ers most accessible to the Denver area . <p> Park at the turnaround near the old mining structures about a mile south of the freeway , at an elevation of 10,335 feet . Hike west across the creek and up through the trees for about 3.5 miles to Chihuahua Lake at 12,500 feet . You 'll have great views of 14,267-foot Torreys on the left and 13,204-foot Grizzly Peak at the head of the valley . <p> 5 . Limber Grove . This is a short , easy , high-altitude hike to a grove of centuries-old limber pine and bristlecone pine trees outside of Fairplay . " It 's just real pretty , " said Barb Heidel , a staffer in the South Park district of Pike National Forest . " It 's good for kids or older people . " <p> Travel 1.4 miles south of Fairplay on U.S. 285 , then west on Park County Road 18 for about 9 miles to Fourmile Campground . Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the entrance and hike southeast through the timber . The trail runs 1.5 miles between Fourmile and Horseshoe Campgrounds , ascending a couple of hundred feet to a high point of close to 11,000 feet along the way . <p> 6 . Lizard Rock . This is an easy , 2.5-mile climb that leads into the south end of the Lost Creek Wilderness , which tends to be less busy than the northern and eastern sections traversed by the Colorado Trail . The route starts at an elevation of 8,500 feet and ends at 9,280 , passing a rock formation that looks like an iguana perched atop a hill . <p> To reach the trailhead , drive southwest of Denver on U.S. 285 over Kenosha Pass to the town of Jefferson , then southeast on Tarryall Road for about 25 miles to Spruce Grove Campground . Or head west of Colorado Springs on U.S. 24 , turn onto the Tarryall Road about 1.2 miles past Lake George and drive 13 miles . <p> For a longer , more strenuous hike , make a visit to Lake Park , a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop using either the Hankins Pass Trail to the east or Brookside-McCurdy Trail to the north . " There are good views , and it takes you by a little lake , " said Barb Heidel . " That south end of the Tarryalls is real pretty , kind of craggy with lots of exposed rocks . " <p> 7 . Fourmile Overlook . This is a difficult 9-mile loop through Mueller State Park west of Colorado Springs , highlighted by a spectacular view of the landmark Dome Rock . " It 's an old ranching road that goes out along some ridges , so there are a lot of ups and downs , " said Sasha Charney , who advises hikers to take along the free maps available at the entrance station because the area is crisscrossed by several other trails . <p> An easier but busier route is the nearby Dome Rock Trail , which goes down the Fourmile Creek drainage , fording the water nine times without bridges . <p> To reach this newest of the state parks , follow U.S. 24 to Divide , then head south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn west . <p> 8 . Roaring Fork . This is a moderate 3-mile trail into the west side of the Indian Peaks Wilderness , which is less crowded than the east side above Boulder . Jeremiah Hale , a student intern for the Granby ranger district of Arapaho National Forest , noted that the trail is limited to foot and horseback traffic . Mountain bikes are prohibited . <p> The trailhead is at the Arapahoe Bay Campground on Lake Granby , about 9 miles east of U.S. 34 on Grand County 125 . From a beginning altitude of 8,360 feet , the trail climbs about 3,000 feet , following Roaring Fork Creek northeast to Lake Watanga , which lies just south of the Rocky Mountain National Park boundary . <p> 9 . Killpecker Creek . This is an easy , little-used trail through woods and along a creek west of Red Feather Lakes , in the Roosevelt National Forest northwest of Fort Collins . From the trailhead on Deadman Road about 7 miles west of the town , the route travels south and onto the west flank of North Bald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> District Ranger Ellen Vollmer Hodges suggested that visitors also drive 4 miles farther west and tour the historic Deadman Fire Lookout Tower , which is no longer staffed full time but is kept open by volunteers on summer weekends . <p> Red Feather Lakes is about 20 miles west of U.S. 287 on Larimer County Road 74E.
