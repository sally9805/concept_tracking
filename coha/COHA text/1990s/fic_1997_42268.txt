Night was about to fall . A crowd of coachmen and pilgrims was sitting in uncle Tikhon 's tavern . An autumn downpour with raging wet winds that lashed across their faces had driven them to seek refuge there . The tired , drenched travelers sat listening to the wind , dozing on benches by the wall . Boredom was written on their faces . One coachman , a pockmarked fellow with a scarred face , held a wet accordion on his knees : he played and stopped mechanically . <p> Outside the tavern door , splashes of rain flew around the dim , grimy lantern . The wind howled like a wolf , yelping , as if to tear itself away from its tether by the door . From the yard came the sound of horses snorting and hoofs thudding in the mud . It was dank and cold . <p> Uncle Tikhon , a tall peasant with a fat face and small , drowsy , deep-set eyes , sat behind the counter . In front of him on the other side of the counter stood a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shabby but respectable . He was wearing a wrinkled summer coat covered with mud , calico pants , and rubber galoshes without shoes . His head , his thin pointed elbows , and the hands jammed into his pockets were shivering feverishly . From time to time a sudden spasm ran down his whole gaunt body , from his horribly haggard face to his rubber galoshes . <p> " For Christ 's sake ! " he said to Tikhon in his scratchy , broken bass . " Give me a drink . . . just a little one , that glass there ! You can put it on my tab ! " <p> " You bet I can ! Nothing but scoundrels in here ! " <p> The scoundrel looked at Tikhon with contempt , with hatred . If he could , he would have murdered him then and there . <p> " You just do n't understand , you lout , you numskull ! It 's not me begging-from deep within my guts , as you say in your peasant lingo ! It 's my illness begging ! Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to see ! Get out ! " <p> " You must understand ! If I do n't get a drink now , if I do n't assuage my passion , I 'm quite capable of committing a crime ! By God , I 'm quite capable ! You bastard , you 've been handing out drinks to drunkards for ages in your damn tavern ! And you 're telling me that till today you never gave a thought to what they were ? Sick people , that 's what ! You can chain them up , beat them , flail them-as long as you give them their vodka ! I humbly beg you ! I implore you ! I 'm demeaning myself . . . Lord , how I am demeaning myself ! " The scoundrel shook his head and spat on the floor . <p> " Give me money and you 'll have your vodka ! " Tikhon said . <p> " Where am I supposed to get money from ? I 've drunk it all ! This coat 's all I 've got left . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath . . . d' you want my hat ? " <p> The scoundrel gave Tikhon his felt hat , whose lining was showing through here and there . Tikhon took the hat , looked at it , and shook his head . <p> " I would n't take this if you gave it to me for nothing ! " he said . " It 's a piece of shit ! " <p> " You do n't like it ? Then give me a drink on credit if you do n't like it . When I come back from town I 'll give you your fiver ! Then you can choke on it ! Yes , choke on it ! " <p> " You trying to con me ? What kind of a man are you ? What did you come here for ? " <p> " I want a drink . Not me , my illness ! Do you understand ? " <p> " Why are you bothering me ? The road outside is full of scum like you ! Go ask them in the name of Christ to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of Christ is bread ! You swine ! " <p> " You can fleece them , the poor bastards , but me-I 'm sorry , I ca n't take their money ! Not me ! " <p> The scoundrel suddenly stopped , blushed , and turned to the pilgrims . <p> " That 's an idea ! You 're Christians ! Will you sacrifice a fiver ? I beg you from deep within my guts ! I 'm ill ! " <p> " Drink water ! " the small man with the pockmarked face laughed . <p> The scoundrel felt ashamed . He started coughing heavily and then fell silent . A few moments later he started pleading again with Tikhon . Finally he burst into tears and began offering his wet coat for a glass of vodka . In the darkness no one could see his tears , and no one took his coat because among the pilgrims there were women who did not want to see a man 's nakedness . <p> " What am I to do now ? " the scoundrel asked in a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? I have to have a drink , or I might well commit a crime . . . even resort to suicide . . what am I going to do ? " <p> He began pacing up and down . <p> The mail coach rolled up , its bells ringing . The wet postman came in , drank a glass of vodka , and left . The mail coach drove on . <p> " I have something golden I 'll give you , " the scoundrel , suddenly deathly pale , said to Tikhon . " Yes , I 'll give it to you . So be it ! Even if what I 'm doing is low-down , vile-here , take it . I am doing this despicable deed because I 'm beside myself . . . even if I were brought before a court of law I would be forgiven . Take it , but only on one condition : that you give it back to me when I return . I 'm giving it to you before witnesses ! " <p> The scoundrel slid his wet hand inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He opened it and glanced at the portrait inside . <p> " I should take the portrait out , but I have nowhere to put it-I 'm soaked . Damn you , take it with the portrait . But on one condition . . . my dear fellow . . . I beg you . . . do n't touch this face with your fingers . I beg you , my dear fellow ! Forgive me for having been so rude to you , for saying the things I said . . . I 'm an idiot . . just do n't touch it with your fingers , and do n't look at the face ! " <p> Tikhon took the medallion , inspected it , and put it in his pocket . <p> " Stolen goods , " he said , and filled a glass . " Well , fine ! Drink ! " <p> The drunkard took the glass in his hand . His eyes flashed , as much as his strength allowed his drunken , bleary eyes to flash , and he drank , drank with feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portrait , he lowered his eyes with shame and went to a corner . There he perched on a bench next to the pilgrims , curled up , and closed his eyes . <p> Half an hour passed in stillness and silence . Only the wind howled , blowing its autumn rhapsody over the chimney . The women pilgrims were praying and soundlessly settling under the benches for the night . Tikhon opened the medallion and looked at the woman 's face smiling out of the golden frame , at the tavern , at Tikhon , at the bottles . <p> A wagon creaked outside . There was a rattling sound and then the thudding of boots in the mud . A short peasant with a pointed beard came running in . He was wet , wearing a long sheepskin coat covered in mud . <p> " There you go ! " he shouted , banging a fiver down on the counter . " A glass of Madeira ! Make it a good one ! " And rakishly swiveling around on one foot , he ran his eye over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? Chicken feathers upon thine aunt ! Scared of the rain ? Ha ! Poor things ! Who 's this raisin here ? " <p> He went over to the scoundrel and looked him in the face . <p> " Oh ! Your Lordship ! " he said . " Semyon Sergeyitch ! Good Heavens ! What ? How come you 're hanging about here in this tavern in such a state ? What are you doing here ? Suffering martyr ! " <p> The squire looked at the peasant and covered his face with his sleeve . The peasant sighed , shook his head , waved his hands about in despair , and went to the counter to finish his drink . <p> " That 's our master , " he whispered to Tikhon , nodding toward the scoundrel . " Our landowner , Semyon Sergeyitch . Look at him ! Look what he looks like now ! Ha ! Just look at that ! What drink can do to you ! " <p> The peasant gulped down his drink , wiped his mouth with his sleeve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four hundred versts from here , from Akhtilovka. . . my folks were his father 's serfs ! Sad , ai n't it ! His Lordship was such a splendid gentleman . This horse here , the one outside , you see it ? He gave it me ! Ha ! That 's fate for you ! " <p> The coachmen and pilgrims started crowding around the peasant . In a quiet voice , over the noises of autumn , he told them the story . Semyon Sergeyitch remained sitting in the same corner , his eyes closed , muttering to himself . He was listening , too . <p> " It happened because of weakness , " the peasant said , gesticulating with his hands . " Too much good life ! He was a rich gentleman-powerful , in the whole province ! Eat , drink , cartloads ! How many times he drove past this very tavern in his carriage-you must have seen him ! He was rich ! Five years ago he was going through Mikishkinski on a barge , and instead of a fiver he gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mainly because of a woman . He fell in love , head over heels , with a woman from town-he loved her more than his life . But he did n't fall in love with a shining falcon . She was a black crow . Marya Egorovna , that was that damn woman 's name , and with a strange last name too-you ca n't even pronounce it . He loved her and proposed to her , all God-fearing and correct . Then , they say , she said yes . After all , His Lordship was n't just anybody-he was sober and rolling in money . Then one evening , I remember well , I 'm walking through the garden . I look , and there they are sitting on the bench kissing . He gives her one kiss , and she , the viper , gives him two back ! He kisses her hand , and her , she blushes . Then she squeezes herself close to him , damn her ! I love you , she says , Semyon . . . and Semyon goes about like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool . . . handing out a ruble here , two there , and me he gave this horse outside ! He was so happy ! He dropped everyone 's debts ! Then came the wedding . They got married all nice and proper . Then , as everyone 's at the dinner , she gets up and goes with the carriage into town to the attorney , who 's her lover . Right after the wedding , the harlot ! At the high point ! Ha ! Then he went nuts , started drinking ! Look at him ! He 's running around like a half-wit thinking of nothing but that harlot ! He loves her ! I bet he 's on his way to town just so he can get a glimpse of her . . . But the other thing , let me tell you , the thing that really ruined him , was his brother-in-law-his sister 's husband . The squire took it into his head to guarantee his brother-in-law with the bank-around thirty thousand he guaranteed ! They say the scoundrel of a brother-in-law knows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our master had to pay the whole thirty thousand ! A fool suffers for his foolishness ! His wife had children with her attorney , his brother-in-law bought an estate near Poltava , and our master wanders around from one tavern to the next like a fool , making us all listen to his moaning : Lost have I , dear brothers , my faith in mankind ! There is no one I can , how shall I put it , believe in ! ' Weakness , that 's what it is ! We all have problems ! So , what are we supposed to do-start drinking ? There 's this corporal we used to have in the army . His wife brings the schoolmaster to her house in broad daylightshe spends all her husband 's money on drink . And that corporal walks about grinning . The only effect was he lost some weight ! " <p> " The Lord does not provide everyone with that kind of strength ! " Tikhon said . <p> " Yeah , everyone 's strength is different , that 's true ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finished the tavern was silent . <p> " Hey , you . . . how 're you feeling ? You unlucky man ! Here , drink ! " Tikhon said , turning to the squire . <p> The squire came up to the counter and drank the vodka with delight . <p> " Give me the medallion for a second , " he whispered to Tikhon . " Just one look and . . . I 'll give it back to you ! " <p> Tikhon frowned , and without saying a word handed him the medallion . The fellow with the pockmarked face sighed , shook his head , and asked for a vodka . <p> " Have a drink , Your Lordship ! Hmm ! Life is good without vodka , but it 's even better with it ! With vodka even sorrow 's not sorrow ! Drink up ! " <p> After five glasses the squire sat down in his comer , opened the medallion , and with clouded , drunken eyes looked for the beloved face . But the face was gone . It had fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lantern flared up and went out . In the comer a woman pilgrim was mumbling in delirium . The fellow with the pockmarked face prayed aloud and then lay down on the bench . Another traveler came in . The rain poured and poured . It got colder and colder , and it seemed as if there would be no end to this vile , dark autumn . The squire was still staring at the medallion , looking for the woman 's face . The candle went out . <p> Spring , where are you ? <p>
