Like a lot of other Americans , journalist Nicols Fox , a former editor at the Washington Journalism Review and a correspondent for The Economist , first heard about the deadly E. coli O157:H7 bacteria in 1993 . That was the year it attacked a group of Northwestern children , all of whom had eaten hamburgers at area Jack in the Box restaurants . Four of them died . Originally an art critic , Fox found herself increasingly drawn into the E. coli case . " At first I thought Jack in the Box was just an anomaly , " she says , " but after checking with the Centers for Disease Control , I found that it was n't just isolated on the west coast  --  it was happening all over . Here was a fascinating story , a new bacterium that had somehow gotten into the food supply . Finding out how that happened became my obsession . " With the writing of her 1997 book , Spoiled : The Dangerous Truth About a Food Chain Gone Haywire ( Penguin ) , Fox answered her questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightening pathogens that have invaded our food supply . These include Salmonella and Campylobacter , both of which have become almost omnipresent in poultry ; and " mad cow " disease , which has invaded British beef and killed a dozen people in England ( see the cover story , this issue ) . Fox is convinced that we can get these dangerous contaminants out of our food supply , and that Sweden 's model programs of scrupulous cleaning and disinfecting show how it can be done . " Over here we 're trying to deal with the problem through meat irradiation and other solutions , instead of attacking it at its source , " says Fox . " We know what factors in chicken rearing , for instance , are responsible for Salmonella outbreaks . Some reforms have been made but , unfortunately , the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) does n't have the authority to order sweeping changes . " Fox , who lives in rural Maine , is working on a new book , It Was Probably Something You Ate : A Practical Guide to Avoiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very scary book about the ways in which modern agricultural and factory farming methods have left us with a food system that is dangerously contaminated . Maybe you could start with an overview of what you found . FOX : First of all , I found that it was really very complicated . Why are we having all of these cases of food-borne illness ? The answer lies in modern processing and factory farming . They both contribute , but the consumer also has a hand in it as well . There are many factors . We have changed our entire relationship to food . We 've changed how we produce it , how we process it , how we distribute it . We 've also changed what we cook , how we cook it , and how we buy it . For instance , consumers want fresh fruits and vegetables all year-round . That means the produce has to come from all over the world , and it does . If you go to your local supermarket , the fruits and vegetables may come from 26 different countries . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment in which those foods were produced . We are consuming the quality of the water and the soil , and the sanitary conditions of the people who pick and pack them . One of the things that scared me most was what you wrote about meat . You describe an incredible amount of contamination in , for instance , poultry . You say that 99 percent of chickens were found by the USDA in a sample to be contaminated with generic E. coli bacteria , indicating fecal contamination . And one E. coli O157:H7-infected cow can contaminate 16 tons of hamburger . Also , 72 percent of chickens in one study were found to be contaminated with Salmonella . If 99 percent of chickens are contaminated with generic E. coli , and 72 percent infected with Salmonella , how dangerous is that to people , assuming they buy chicken at the supermarket and they cook it properly ? It puts an incredible onus on the cooking process . It certainly does . Cooking can kill these microbes and render the food safe for you to eat , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen . Take chicken , for instance . Virtually ally all of the chickens we buy are contaminated with something called Campylobacter , which you may have never heard of . Yet it is the most frequent cause of diarrheal disease in most parts of this country . If we are cooking our chicken thoroughly , why are so many people getting sick ? Some studies have shown that the person most likely to become sick is the person preparing the chicken , because it 's on their hands  --  it may also get on the counters , on the cutting boards , etcetera . You have to be very careful not to transfer the bacteria that are on these products into things that you are going to eat without cooking , like salad ingredients . You note that when cooking hamburgers on the grill , you have to be careful not to put the cooked hamburgers on the platter that also held the uncooked hamburgers . You can re-contaminate the meat that way . That 's exactly right . Anything that you have touched with that uncooked meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product , and that would be something like a spatula . People do n't even think of that . There are actually cases where people have become seriously ill because of the spatula that was used to transfer an uncooked , then a cooked burger . To me it is really asking the consumer to operate a kind of biohazard lab , and that 's too complicated for me . I just stopped bringing meat into the kitchen . You 're what you call a " reluctant " vegetarian . I 'm sad to say that , really , I 've always enjoyed meat in my diet . The first thing I gave up was hamburger . I think I would n't have been so concerned about it if it were something I 'd ground myself . But hamburger now is mass produced in places like Iowa or Nebraska from all the scraps left over from cutting meat . As you 've already pointed out , one contaminated cow can contaminate a significant amount of meat , because hamburger may contain a hundred different animals from four different countries . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're essentially saying what Oprah Winfrey said . Would you go so far as to recommend that people not eat hamburger ? I think everyone has to make their own decision . If you really are a hamburger fanatic and are so unwise as to want to eat it rare , then you probably ought to go to the grocery store , buy a chuck steak and bring it home . Grind it up yourself in your own clean grinder , which you make sure to wash thoroughly afterwards . I know that 's a lot of trouble , but when I say that , I 'm surprised at the number of people who say , My grandmother used to do that . ' I think that we 've become very complacent about our food . We do n't want to give it any time or attention , and we put it so low on our scale of values . It 's really become no more than a refueling process . One of the implications of what you 're saying is that you are not necessarily safe if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you buy , say , a commercial supermarket salad packaged in a bag , I imagine it is very easy for that salad to become contaminated . Well , yes . We have to ask , what was this lettuce washed in ? Who cut it up for us ? I think it 's ironic that we turned a lot of food safety activity over to the lowest-paid workers in our entire economy . Some of those salad bags come labeled " triple-washed " and the implication is clearly that these foods are ready for the salad bowl . And yet , I took a bag of that " triple-washed " lettuce , washed it and found about a tablespoon of dirt in the bottom of the pan . Not enough consumers are aware that just about everything you eat needs to be washed , and even that 's not a guarantee . But I have to go back and say that you are more likely to confront these disease-causing microorganisms on animal products , which are contaminated by animal waste . Fecal matter gets onto the meat during slaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can exacerbate it . Vegetables are less likely to be contaminated with animal waste , but it can happen . Let 's talk about Salmonella and eggs a little bit . You wrote that cooking eggs the ways millions of Americans like them , sunny side up , for instance , does n't necessarily kill Salmonella . That 's right . These were tests carried out in England . What has happened to the egg is nothing less than a tragedy , because the egg is such a versatile food . I was looking in my master French cook book and found 123 main course dishes that contained egg . If you cooked them the way we are now directed to cook them , there would only be 23 of those dishes left , an 83 percent decline . In these English tests , they inoculated eggs with Salmonella and then checked to see how hard they had to be before the Salmonella died . And they found that only scrambling them quickly at a very high heat , boiling them for nine minutes or longer , or frying them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Health Department did a survey of people who had Salmonella infections , the great majority of them had eaten undercooked eggs , just in the ordinary way many of us had : Sunny side up , poached or something like that . How could we effectively rid ourselves of Salmonella contamination ? I eat organic eggs from a small producer in Massachusetts . They are fed grain , not the kind of chicken feed that may contain ground-up chickens and animal protein which may contain bacteria . The chickens go outside . And they do n't get antibiotics , which is another factor in stressing these birds . Most importantly , though , these birds are tested three times in their life for Salmonella and the tests have come up negative . Most eggs in the United States are raised in factory operations where you have something like 70,000 birds in a huge hen house . How do we mainstream the kind of conditions you 're talking about ? We 'd have to change the way we 're producing eggs , because all of the factors in intensive production have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we breed chickens for producing eggs on a very regular basis  --  we select for the best producers . So if you go into a commercial hen house , all the chickens are actually like clones , as close as you can get without actually cloning them . This means that they 're all identically susceptible to disease . The feed that they get may well be contaminated ; it often is . They are fed antiobiotics , which not only selects for certain bacterial strains , it seems to lead to antibiotic resistance in these strains . Rats and mice may get in the house and run on the conveyer belts that feed these birds and then take away their eggs . They may run from house to house so that disease may spread between the houses . The water may be dirty . All of these factors are going to contribute to the birds being susceptible to certain diseases , and in one way or another , they can pass them on to us . Unfortunately , what I see facing the world is an imperative to produce food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to double its population by 2100 . Many countries have doubled or tripled their populations very recently . Just to keep up with feeding people , some observers say we more or less have to go with intensive crop management , using a lot of pesticides and intensive animal agriculture . That 's operating on the assumption that the only way we can produce this amount of food is through intensive farming , and I do n't believe that is necessarily true . Organic farmers are finding that it is not as difficult as it originally was thought to produce high-quality , high-yield food in a competitive situation . I think we also need to look closely at the things that are making disease worse . For instance , we might have more of a variety in chickens in these houses . We might have smaller houses , and more of them . We might not have them connected with conveyer belts , which can spread disease . The houses should certainly be kept clean , and the animals need clean food and water  --  that 's only common sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and that 's been a matter of USDA policy . We need to look again at that policy and see whether it is truly helpful to us as a nation . It may be resulting in more food-borne disease , which just shifts the true cost elsewhere . That 's not to say that more expensive food is always safer , because it certainly is n't . Look at the people who got sick from expensive imported raspberries . There are many factors creating this increase in food-borne disease . We just need to take a saner approach . <p>
