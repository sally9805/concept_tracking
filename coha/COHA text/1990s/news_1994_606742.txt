<p> Will an invasion of Haiti hurt the stock market ? The common wisdom on Wall Street seems to say " no . " <p> Market analysts suggest that , as military confrontations go , an American move into Haiti wo n't qualify as a big enough deal to unsettle the markets . The Haitian military is tiny , compared with the 20,000-member force that would comprise the U.S.-led invasion . And thus , the analysts believe , the hostilities will be over quickly . <p> But while that thinking could be right in the short run , it could be very wrong in the long run . That was my conclusion after a conversation with market guru Rob Brown , who hangs his hat at Ferris , Baker Watts in Baltimore . Brown 's view was that the impact of a Haitian adventure on the stock market would depend less on military factors than on psychological ones . <p> If the invasion goes off without a hitch , taking place cleanly and quickly and without casualties , Brown observed , the markets will continue on their normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Clinton no special credit for the effort . <p> But if there are casualties inflicted on U.S. troops by the Haitian military , or worse yet , if there are casualties caused by " friendly fire , " as happened in the Persian Gulf , or if GIs are killed or injured in jeep accidents or plane crashes unrelated to the fighting  --  a Haitian invasion could become a major embarrassment to the Clinton administration . <p> If that were to happen , Brown suggested , Haiti could , indeed , wind up having a major impact on the markets . An embarrassing outcome in Haiti could give foreign investors a reason to sell dollars and buy other currencies . A falling dollar would create concern at the Federal Reserve , which might feel it had to boost interest rates to bring those investors back to these shores . <p> And , if interest rates went higher , it would once again frighten investors and cause them to sell their stocks . That , you may recall , was exactly what happened earlier this year when the Fed 's decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dow Jones industrial average , you may also recall , peaked at 3978.36 on Jan. 31 , a whisper away from the magic 4000 mark . That was shortly before the Fed began to raise rates for the first time in several years . The move did n't sit well with either the stock or bond markets and it took until last Thursday for the Dow to return to 4000 territory , when it closed at 3953.88 . <p> Of course , just when it seemed the tone of the market was improving , the Dow opened on Friday by dropping 40 points . The problem : Good news about industrial production was translated into bad news about inflation and , it sent bond prices diving . Bonds took stocks down with them  --  stocks fell only 20 points as it happened  --  but it was scary for a while . <p> The plunge came the morning after Clinton 's Thursday night speech about Haiti . But Brown was not willing to blame the market action on Haiti . No , it was those economic numbers that did the damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been several quasi-political aspects to the recent recovery of the stock market . <p> One was the failure of health reform . The market liked that , because it meant there would be no tax increases linked to a new health plan , he said . Second , Clinton 's fading support across the country meant that Republicans might stand a better chance to capture the White House in two years  --  and many market participants , who support the Republicans , were happy about that too , Brown said . <p> As for Haiti , it seems , an invasion will be like throwing the proverbial rock into the pond . Even if the splash does n't get you , the ripples could go on forever . <p> They 've got mergers on their minds . Especially in the thrift business . And analysts Vernon C. Plack and Guy W. Ford at Scott &; Stringfellow in Richmond have some ideas about what the thrifts in this region might be worth in a buyout . <p> Their assumption is that the buyer would be a regional bank already operating in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stock swap and would not dilute value of either stock , and the deal will give the buyer up to 40 percent in cost savings . <p> Here are some of the analysts ' estimated takeover prices for thrifts in this area . The name of the institution is followed by its trading symbol , its stock price as of Aug. 29 , its estimated takeover price and the takeover premium . <p> First , Virginia-based thrifts : <p> Ameribanc Investors Group ( AINVS ) , $ 2.19 and $ 3.25 , a 48 percent premium . <p> Charter Federal Savings Bank ( CHFD ) , $ 12.50 and $ 18 , a 44 percent premium . <p> Columbia First Bank ( CFFS ) , $ 46.50 and $ 58 , a 25 percent premium . <p> Jefferson Savings &; Loan Association ( JEFF ) , $ 11.75 and $ 16 , a 36 percent premium . <p> Virginia First Financial ( VFFC ) , $ 15.50 and $ 30 , a 94 percent premium . <p> Washington Federal Savings ( WFSB ) , $ 4.19 and $ 7.25 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Equitable Federal Savings Bank ( EQSB ) , $ 17 and $ 28 , a 65 percent premium . <p> First Citizens Financial Corp . ( FCIT ) , $ 16.25 and $ 26 , a 60 percent premium . <p> Home Federal Corp ( HFMD ) , $ 5.50 and $ 10 , an 82 percent premium . <p> Laurel Bancorp ( LAUR ) , $ 11 and $ 16 , a 45 percent premium . <p> Loyola Capital Corp . ( LOYC ) , $ 23.25 and $ 31 , a 33 percent premium . <p> Maryland Federal Bancorp ( MFSL ) , $ 27.75 and $ 50 , an 80 percent premium . <p> Washington Savings Bank ( WSB ) , $ 4.63 and $ 5.25 , a 14 percent premium . <p> In the District : <p> Independence Federal Savings ( IFSB ) , $ 7.50 and $ 13 , a 73 percent premium . <p> Love that speculation ! <p> Ever since UNC Inc. of Annapolis announced in June that it was acting to lower its costs and raise its profits , the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . Then , last week , UNC offered its forecast of what 's ahead . <p> Sales , it said , will be up 5 percent in the third quarter but not much in the fourth quarter . While profits will be higher than last year , they wo n't be anything to write home about . Weak market conditions in the airplane repair business continue , the company said . <p> The market seemed to pay little attention to the forecast . Although trading volume went up , the stock remained at about $ 5 . Then , Friday , somebody decided it was time to jump in . UNC shares rose to $ 6.25 on heavy volume . It was n't a big gain . But for this stock , it was a long way from $ 5 . <p> Trading was heavy early last week in the shares of Martek Biosciences Corp. , after the company announced that it had made a deal with Merck &; Co . Inc. , one of the nation 's largest drug companies . Martek , based in Columbia , is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The deal with Merck provides that Merck will screen extracts from Martek 's micro-algae library , looking for ways to develop uses for algae that will be applicable to human or animal health or to agriculture . If Merck finds something that works , it will negotiate the payments that will be made to Martek as the product develops . And finally , if the product is successful , Martek will receive royalties . <p> Martek already uses algae to produce a product that is used in infant formula . <p> When the news about the Merck deal broke a week ago , about 105,000 shares of Martek changed hands , far more than is usual . Martek stock climbed to $ 15 in May on a flurry of good news . But the price soon retreated , and the stock has been trading in the $ 8 to $ 10 range . It closed Friday at $ 9.75 . <p> Univax Biologics Inc. of Rockville has sold another 4 million shares at $ 5.50 a share . The buyers were institutional investors , some of whom already held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total number of outstanding shares to 17 million . <p> The company said it netted $ 21.6 million from the sale , which it conducted itself . From that money , the firm will use $ 14 million for research , $ 2 million to build new facilities and $ 3 million for marketing . Univax specializes in immunization technology , used to battle infectious diseases . ?
