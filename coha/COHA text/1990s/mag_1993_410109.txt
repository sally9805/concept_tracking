" Free " must surely be America 's most seductive four-letter word . No wonder , then , that Crested Butte 's ski-for-free campaign between Thanksgiving and Christmas has been seducing skiers in record numbers for the past two years . No strings , no gimmicks : Just show up at the window and ask for a lift ticket . We 're talking about a high-end freebie here . Stashing a free rub-on tattoo in a box of Cracker Jack is one thing ; giving away tens of thousands of $39 lift tickets is something else altogether . This astonishing promotion was enough to seduce me , too . Curious about just what the Colorado ski resort had up its sleeve , I decided to drop in on Crested Butte last year during the second-annual ski-for-free event , which lasted from November 20 to December 19 . It was n't just the free tickets that drew me in . I wanted to be part of what was sure to be a major scene  --  a happening  --  something along the lines of , say , the frenzied rampage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on VCRs in the electronics department . That 's how it was in 1991 . Or so I heard . The way Colorado newspapers reported it , the first announcement of the promotion radiated like a beacon to skinflinty ski bums far and wide , who descended on the tiny Victorian-era town , three miles from the ski area , in rust-bucket cars and camper vans . Scruffy kids overnighting in beat-up vehicles , living on beer , cannabis , and Dinty Moore beef stew right out of the can , knocking on doors in town begging for a sofa to crash on or a free shower : It sounded like something along the lines of a ' ' 60s-redux ski-in . " Sure , there were people sleeping in cars , " confirms Bob Gillen , Crested Butte 's former marketing director , who was instrumental in launching the ski-for-free idea . " There were people sleeping under cars . " This is n't exactly what the resort had had in mind when it dreamed up the idea . The basic plan was to try to boost business during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured that the promise of free lift tickets would draw more people to the relatively remote resort , which lies at the end of Highway 135 in the Elk Mountains . More people in town would mean more people spending money for meals , lodging , and merchandise . Local businesses , in turn , agreed to chip in a share of extra revenues to the ski area as a way of offsetting the money sacrificed in giving away tickets . The whole community would benefit . It would also serve as a kind of free-sample promo : People would come , try the skiing , like it , and return at another time for another vacation  --  this time , perhaps , actually paying for tickets . Apparently the plan is working . On Friday , November 27 , 1992 , a couple of weeks before my arrival , 8,515 skiers had showed up , breaking by 60 the single-day Crested Butte record that had been set a year earlier , on November 29 , during the first ski-for-free promo . With 106,343 tickets given away , the period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busiest 30-day run in Crested Butte 's 31-year history . The resort went on to post its highest number of skier days ever , at over half a million . But as for the " scene "  --  by the time I got there , it looked like business-as-usual . There were no traffic jams , no stampedes to the ticket windows , no lift lines snaking into the parking lot . ( A new base-to-summit high-speed quad that replaced the old Silver Queen double helped do away with the lines , which had been so long the previous season that Crested Butte employees gave away coffee and doughnuts to keep lift-liners happy . ) No , just a lot of families , as far as I could make out , from places like Tulsa and Amarillo . More like a convention of 4-H clubs than a neo-hippie happening . So what changed ? Perhaps , as Gillen suggested , limited snow conditions in ' ' 92 made the promotion less appealing to gonzo ski-bum types , since Extreme Limits , where most of Crested Butte 's expert terrain is located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain 's front side , however , had plenty enough snow  --  both natural and machine-made  --  to keep the rest of the skiing population happy . ) Also , Gillen , now vice president of marketing and sales at Sugarbush , Vermont , believes , " the ski area did a better job in the second year of selling Free Ski to the destination-skier market i.e. , vacationing families . You 've got to do something like that more than once before most people are willing to plan a vacation around it . " Indeed , according to surveys conducted by Crested Butte ski area , out-of-staters accounted for 53 percent of the ski-for-free skiers in 1991 as compared with 70 percent in ' ' 92 . Also , 33.5 percent of the ski-for-freers in ' ' 91 had incomes of less than $15,000 a year , compared with 24 percent in ' ' 92 . In other words , fewer cheapskates , more money-spenders . Still , doubts about the ski-for-free biz surfaced in ' ' 91 and still linger around Crested Butte . " Last year , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is already very limited , " complained Gary Sprung , president of the High Country Citizens ' Alliance , a local group promoting responsible and environmentally conscious development . " I think I 'm speaking for a fair chunk of the community in saying we do n't like Ski Free . It creates a cheap quality for the area . It brings in a lot of freeloaders . " In addition , according to one restauranteur , some employees grumbled about having to give up early-season skiing on an uncrowded mountain in order to work . Gillen concedes that there was some irritation about the promotion during the first year , citing specifically the parking problem and overcrowding of the mountain . The payoff , he noted , was that the community " did get all kinds of revenue . " Indeed , the town brought in an increase of nearly $35,000 in sales taxes during the ski-for-free period last year . Despite the misgivings of some local citizens , such returns have encouraged Crested Butte to keep the ski-for-free concept going , at least for this season . FREE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from November 19 to December 18 . Simply pick up a lift ticket at the ticket window . In addition , first-time skiers ages seven and older can sign up at the ski school desk for free lessons . Crested Butte lies 28 miles north of Gunnison , 230 miles southwest of Denver .
