U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher took heat from Congress for his chilly reception in Beijing two weeks ago . But what Christopher 's critics did n't know is that the advance foray by one of his deputies that so irritated the Chinese was carried out without Christopher 's knowledge . The Secretary was unaware that John Shattuck , Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights , was meeting a week earlier with Chinese dissident leader Wei Jingsheng . The U.S. embassy arranged the visit at the last minute and expected Wei to keep it secret .
