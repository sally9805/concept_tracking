Future art historians will mark the 1994-95 , season as the year the art world went on line . Art buffs with the requisite computer-and-modem hardware and Internet access could discuss the Whitney Biennial and Lacanian theory , inspect an international array of museum schedules , search the International Repertory of the Literature of Art ( RILA ) , and peruse auction prices from Sotheby 's and Christie 's . They could also view art works  --  some for sale and others designed for electronic , interactive formats  --  by artists ranging from paleolithic daubers to Laurie Anderson . The advent of this brave new electronic art world coincided , of course , with the emergence of a vast and rapidly expanding electronic communication network in society at large . By last summer , some eight percent of American households were on line , most via commercial services such as America Online , Prodigy and CompuServe . Computer-equipped consumers could preview Sony 's current film offerings , read  --  and discuss  --  Noam Chomsky 's articles and monitor Congress , Socks ( the White House cat ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcripts updated daily on Time-Warner 's Pathfinder site . Corporations , institutions and individuals have established approximately 300,000 Internet outposts since mid-1993 . ( Although the Defense Department-initiated Internet has been on line since 1969 , until recently it has been used mostly by researchers . ) The majority of the new sites are on the World Wide Web ( WWW ) , a portion of the Internet built on hypertext technology and the closest thing yet to that ill-defined " Information Superhighway . " The astonishing rapidity of this information explosion has been matched only by the media-driven hype surrounding it . During the past year , hardly a day has gone by without the major dailies running breathless coverage of some aspect of the Internet . In the midst of a flood of books on the subject , Being Digital , Nicholas Negroponte 's stimulating collection of columns from Wired magazine , turned out to be a huge best-seller . The enthusiasm of the Wired crowd was carried to a hyperbolic extreme by the magazine 's founder and publisher , Louis Rossetto . " I thought there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he recalled in an Apr. 11 lecture at the New York Public Library . Is it any wonder that such hype has spawned a backlash ? This perhaps inevitable phenomenon came in the form of recent books like Clifford Stoll 's Silicon Snake Oil and Kirkpatrick Sale 's Rebels Against the Future : The Luddites and Their War on the Industrial Revolution . On Apr. 26 , the FBI released a letter by the " Unabomber , " the mail-bomb terrorist(s) , that dramatically underscored such criticism : " If you had any brains , " he wrote , " you would have realized that there are a lot of people out there who resent bitterly the way techno-nerds like you are changing the world . " As Sale observed , the apt connection here is not to information-age haves and have-nots , but to the early-19th-century Luddites who mounted attacks on English factories and machines because they feared that industrialization would impair their livelihoods and culture . The new communications technology has already significantly affected museums and libraries . Will it also revolutionize the production of art ? As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed gathering of the American Section of the International Association of Art Critics at the Museum of Modern Art on Apr. 10 . " We 're at a crossroads . It 's our job as critical thinkers to assess what 's good and bad ... in the new kinds of speech like multi-media and e-mail . " My notes from that meeting bear two scrawled comments : " Remind never to let anyone publish my e-mail " and " Were n't we all going to become TV producers  --  rather than consumers  --  after Nam June Paik introduced us to affordable video cameras ? " Some anthropologists would argue that the history of technology is the history of humankind and that the essential questions about technology simply recur , rather than change . The appropriate art analogy may be that much of the most effective electronic art can , in fact , only be understood within the tradition of information-oriented conceptual , media and video art that emerged during the 1960s and ' ' 70s . Even in these ahistorical times , we all know that the Renaissance did not spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the season I went on line . What follows is an account , partly in diary form , of my experiences from my first extended exposure to bulletin boards and on-line art works last fall to my decision at the end of the season to order the ( expensive ) hardware necessary to upgrade my system for Net " surfing " at home . I also stress the subjectivity of this report because no single individual could partake of more than a tiny percentage of the available on-line art and art discourse . In this article , I will discuss only a fraction of what I 've seen on line this year . According to Timothy Druckrey , co-editor of the invaluable anthology Culture on the Brink : Ideologies of Technology , more than 5,000 artists have staked out sites on the Internet . Likewise , every large city offers several local electronic bulletin boards that compete with the corporate giants ' services . Some of them host art conferences ; most provide access to newsgroups  --  noncommercial forums on the Internet , some of them art-related . To call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if , as with the cornucopia of programming offered by cable television , most of it warrants only a passing glance . Consider this article my preliminary notes for a guide to the exploding on-line art world . I also discuss some of the social and political forces-such as the increasing tendency to censor electronic communication  --  that are shaping the emerging media . A note about the article 's format : The diary entries that follow are in italic type , while commentary that chronologically extends those entries to include related developments throughout the 1994-95 season is printed in roman type . Sept. 21 , 1994 : Art For Sale After the opening of a digital photography exhibition at the Fashion Institute of Technology , I met with classical musician Jeannie Novak and Pete Markiewicz , a former biologist and animator , who are the founders of Kaleidospace . We found a quiet trattoria in Chelsea where they turned on their Powerbook to show me demonstration disks that simulated the experience of an on-line visit to Kaleidospace . They call it the first commercial gallery on the Internet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings true simply because no contradictory information has crossed my desk at the Village Voice and because the graphical technology for Web " browsing " is itself so new . ) Fewer than a dozen artists are represented in their virtual gallery ; none are names I recognize , and most of their works are modestly priced ( http : //kspace.com is Kaleidospace 's site address or URL  --  uniform resource locator , which is necessary to reach an Internet " location " ) . In the case of two-dimensional works on paper , entire prints are shown in imperfect resolution  --  augmented by sharp details  --  so perfect copies ca n't be easily downloaded . Individual artists presenting or " posting " art in the studio pay a $50 setup fee for the first piece , $25 for those that follow , and a $50 monthly charge for electronic maintenance . Galleries will pay more for the same services ( Kaleidospace acts as an agent for other galleries as well ) . Since artists are not represented in the traditional career-building sense , Kaleidospace most closely resembles the existing retailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of June 1995 , Kaleidospace offered the work of 50 artists . It was joined by other commercial-gallery Web sites including : Rhombus ( http : // www.together.net/ ( symbol omitted ) rhombus ) , the virtual counterpart of a gallery in Burlington , Vermont ; ArtNetWeb ( http : //www.awa.com/artnetweb/ ) , a New York bulletin board and Internet site featuring a registry of works by 15 artists ( most works are for sale ) ; and Plexus ( http : //www.interport.net/ ( symbol omitted ) plexus ) , an Internet site showcasing virtual exhibitions and works available for purchase . ( Options for purchasing range from communicating orders by telephone , fax and e-mail to leaving your credit card number in an encrypted area of the service . ) Many artists paying to post images of their art on the Web lack major gallery representation . By contrast , dealer Thea Westreich 's Artix puts well known galleries on-line  --  offering images and information about artists affiliated with the Marlborough , Paolo Baldacci , Luhring Augustine , Jason McCoy , Allan Stone , Sandra Gering , Schmidt Bingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gallery , the offerings tend to be restricted to image , title and name of artist . Westreich is unclear about whether the posted images have resulted in sales . Westreich has since split from Artix and is currently developing a more ambitious project called The Art Network . Her observation that the Internet is a better vehicle for selling collectibles than fine art is echoed by Kaleidospace 's Jeannie Novak , who told me that " we 've sold lots of low-end prints  --  and even a $650 lithograph by Stephen Holland  --  but not too many originals . " Of all New York dealers , Sandra Gering has the highest electronic profile ; she 's moved far beyond using the Net as a tool for selling art . Last season she presented Orlan in electronic video transmission from the shape-shifting body artist 's hospital bed . This year the gallery showed the ambitious " Bioinformatica " exhibition reviewed in A.i.A. , July ' ' 95 . It also boasts its own Internet site featuring Alter Stats , an ingenious work by artist John Simon , Jr. , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual space ( http : //www.interport , net/ ( symbol omitted ) gering ) . Should Larry Gagosian and Mary Boone be fretting about on-line competition ? Not yet . Even with thousands of colors , the computer monitor is ill-equipped to reproduce the visual subtleties of light shimmering on bronze or the textures of paint on canvas . Art retailing is also a relationship-oriented enterprise often based on personal bonds between collectors and dealers . 0n the other hand , the computer provides a reliable way of disseminating information about an already-known artist 's work . Not surprisingly , the auction houses are currently investigating on-line publishing to alleviate the high cost of catalogue preparation and distribution . The on-line service of the New York firm ArtNet , which has built up a data base covering some 1.3 million works of art , already offers full-color images and auction results dating back to 1985 . ( ArtNet can be reached by phone at 1-800-4-ARTNET . ) Sept. 25 : The File Room I finally got around to seeing Antonio Muntadas 's The File Room ( http : //fileroom.aaup.uic , edu/FILEROOM.html @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Wide Web , it was created in conjunction with Chicago 's Randolph Street Gallery and went on line in May 1994 . Through my column last year I 'd helped the well-known conceptualist solicit case histories for his archive of cultural censorship since the time of the ancient Greeks , but I had no idea how extensive this data base would turn out to be . The archive 's reach is especially remarkable in its documentation of 20th-century offenses . They range from the internment of Carl Muck , the Boston Symphony Orchestra conductor who was jailed in 1918 for refusing to play the national anthem , to the recent alleged harassment of America Online users for violating the service 's vague prohibitions against " vulgar language " or explicit sex talk . I was delighted to see that current  --  as well as historical  --  transgressions are being tracked by this ongoing work . The File Room debuted with some 450 entries compiled by a team of researchers . Since then , members of the public have added hundreds of entries to the interactive data base . Visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  will also find links to the on-line resources of free speech organizations like the ACLU . In addition to its more-or-less permanent status on the Internet , The File Room opened as an installation at the Chicago Cultural Center , where it was seen by 80,000 visitors in 1994 . It was later shown in Leipzig and Bucharest . One thing the archive offers citizens of formerly totalitarian societies is a site for anonymously documenting offenses committed by past regimes . Muntadas implied such possibilities in his introductory notes to the project , in which he referred to it  --  a la Joseph Beuys  --  as a " social sculpture " that " gains its meaning through a group effort of individuals , organizations , and institutions . " I was reminded , too , of the liberatingly subversive impact of mail art 30 years ago . Muntadas 's interest in communication systems and the decentralization of power links The File Room to other projects ( art work hardly seems an apt descriptor ) that exploit the Internet as a vast information resource , rather than simply a new means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ http : **36;29;TOOLONG ) , for example , grew out of its creator 's interest in ethnographic art , but he describes his aims as the development of " graphic communication tools , " not the production of art . The New York art professor is working to implement a system of satellite- , voice- and modem-based telecommunications ( the so-called World Phone ) to connect school children and conservationists in the Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area of New Guinea with nearby villages , as well as with students and researchers at the Center for Long Distance Art and Culture at Lehman College in the Bronx . Sept. 30 : Art on Disk Tonight I attended the awards ceremony at Lincoln Center for the New Voices , New Vision competition , which opened the New York Video Festival . Co-sponsored by the multimedia publisher Voyager , Interval Research Corporation and Wired , the competition was designed to recognize independent art works created to run on a computer . The works demonstrated for the audience were produced on floppy disks or CD-Roms  --  which is the format that presently epitomizes the so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CD-Roms employ the compressed ( digitized ) audio and video files used for on-line art works and virtually every other electronic purpose . Given the expense of digitization , it 's inevitable that art works on disk will be increasingly " re-purposed " for on-line distribution . Of the competition 's three $5,000-prize winners ( Hsin-Chien Huan , George Legrady and Todd Robbins ) , only Legrady 's allusive An Anecdoted Archive of the Cold War is really art ( Robbins 's piece is a prototype for a musical toy ; Huan 's is a tour de force of animation techniques . ) Legrady 's poetic collage of propaganda posters , photos documenting the Hungarian uprising , and images of his refugee childhood is set in a virtual architectural environment that evokes a library suffused with Proustian allusions to the indexing and archiving of experience . Because the winning works in the competition were demonstrated for the audience from an on-stage computer , a brief look replaced a self-guided experience of them . Voyager has produced an 25 of the winners and honorable mentions on a CD-Rom that was released in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently makes their production impossible for most artists . Distribution possibilities are also limited . What multimedia artists need are the sort of services provided by Electronic Arts Intermix , the savvy , New York-based rental-distribution outlet for selected video artists . Oct. 20 : Bulletin Board Chat Fest Today I went on line with Echo  --  the self-styled hip , arts-oriented New York bulletin board and on-line service provider  --  and began to monitor the conferences run by sponsors like the Village Voice and the Whitney Museum of American Art . ( Echo can be reached at ( 212 ) 292-0900 ; for those with a computer and modem , Echo 's log-on number is ( 212 ) 292-0910  --  type " newuser . " Echo 's Web site is : http : //www.echonyc.com . ) The Whitney is the second museum to host an ongoing conference on a bulletin board . ( The Smithsonian 's conference on America Online has been around longer . ) Museum curators and guests occasionally log on for real-time chat events , but the conference mostly provides ongoing bulletin-board style discussions on such topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Works of Art " and " The Biennial . " I discovered that one can initially read months of old postings and then decide whether or not to add to the " conversation . " Unfortunately , the discussion is almost invariably pretty unfocused , and too reminiscent of all-night , college bull sessions . The Whitney 's " Art Critics " discussion-topic , for instance , began in mid-1994 with these posted comments : Tetsuwan Nemo : Why is n't everyone a critic ? KZ : I thought everyone was . Neandergal : I usually like reading any kind of criticism more than experiencing the actual " thing " whether it 's a book , movie , painting etc . That 's why I spend all my time on Echo instead of reading books .... It 's all commentary and you never have to feel anything . Ironically , of the entire 15-or-so months of postings I perused , these first comments seem most representative  --  and salient . One problem with the BBS ( bulletin board service ) format  --  which allows users to post messages and conduct on-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken conversation . ( Just how much irony did Neandergal intend to communicate ? ) Another difficulty is anonymity . Vast numbers of bulletin board and Internet users employ " tags " or " handles . " Many users find this elective role-play liberating and have referred to the intimacy-inducing quality of such exchanges . But I remain dubious about the state of intimacy in our television-and radio-talk-show-ridden culture . What can intimacy mean when it 's cloaked in anonymity ? This week I also started to monitor The Thing , which may be the oldest visual-art bulletin board in the country and certainly provides the most challenging level of posted art discourse  --  or on-line chat  --  of any I 've encountered . ( The Thing can be reached at 212-604-0698 ; its log-on number is 212-366-1199 . ) The Thing 's several hundred subscribers sometimes passionately debate cultural and critical theory . ( Users from branches  --  or nodes  --  in London , Geneva , Duesseldorf , Cologne and Vienna can also join the conversation . ) Its conferencing areas are augmented with files of images and essays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and frequently changing exhibitions and artworks . During the 1994-95 season , the range of The Thing 's on-line art extended from James Nares 's swirl-art-evoking prints to David Platzker 's quicktime movies of artist 's books by John Baldessari , which were simultaneously on view under glass at Printed Matter . I found the former seductively eye-popping ; the latter  --  though crudely produced  --  provided a welcome look at the artist 's classic , two-decade-old works . Thing projects are also exhibited on its Web site at http : //www.thing.net/thingnyc . Two years ago , I asked artist Wolfgang Staehle  --  one of the founders of the nonprofit bulletin board  --  whether or not the four-year-old enterprise constituted his art . He adamantly denied it . Now it 's the New York resident 's full-time creative work and another " social sculpture " ; it also brings to mind the salon-style talk-fests that Tom Maroni has been hosting for two decades at his Museum of Conceptual Art in San Francisco . In the face of mounting competition from corporate on-line services , boutique boards like The Thing are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently scrambling to broaden his audience by providing subscribers with full on-line services and Internet access . Nov. 8 : The World 's First Collaborative Sentence Douglas Davis opened his exhibition InterActions 1967-1981 at the Lehman College Art Gallery in the Bronx . ( He co-directs the college 's Center for Long Distance Art and Culture with gallery director Susan Hoeltzel . ) Davis has long pioneered the creation of interactive performances and installations that humanize technology by revealing the desire embodied in cold steel and cathode rays . He 's exhorted viewers to reach up and press their hands ( and other body parts ) against video monitors , and he produced the first global satellite performance in 1977 . In the exhibition , the documentation of such activities , and the presentation of related art works , demonstrated the continuity of his output . At the opening of his show , he presented an on-line performance called Discours Amoureux , which was a scripted dialogue with Russian artist Nathalie Novarina , who responded on a computer in Galerie St Gervais in Geneva . Their elliptical , bilingual discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In December , Davis inaugurated a Web site through the center 's server or host computer ( http : **29;67;TOOLONG ) . The title says it all : The World 's First ( and probably longest ) Collaborative Sentence . See review on p. 93 . As of September , more than 50,000 collaborators had left their mark on this text . Thirty or so lines into it someone wrote : " who do we think we are James Joyce 's great grandchildren " and someone else responded , " or some kind of gertrude " ; The Sentence is a surprising , often amusing work that makes ingeniously simple ( and cheap ) use of the hypertext medium . Davis recently presented the piece in gallery format at Korea 's Kwangju Biennale . A first : in the spring of 1995 , shortly before his untimely death , New York mega-collector Eugene Schwartz purchased The Sentence for " what dinner for eight would cost at a decent restaurant . " Nov. 11 : The Electronic Cafe A branch of the Santa Monica-based Electronic Cafe International , conceived by artists Kit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally opened in New York  --  at The Kitchen . ( Other branches are located in France , Germany and throughout the U.S. ) The Electronic Cafe is less a physical place than a slate of on-line events that will take place in the Kitchen 's gallery and auditorium spaces . Opening night featured Cafe Barbie , a panel discussion about the iconic doll moderated by Barbie-maven M.G. Lord and augmented with live teleconferencing from Santa Monica and Paris . It was a technical disaster in the tradition of art transmissions via satellite ca. 1980 : The Paris link did n't work , depriving us of the chance to see  --  although we could hear  --  performance artist Cindy Jackson , the surgically altered " Living Barbie . " Video from the Santa Monica cafe looked like a poorly dubbed movie because the " CU-see-me " ( video ) format unsynched speakers ' words from the movements of their mouths . The event was also a showcase for performance-art-style aggression a la early Kipper Kids or Karen Finley . An ill-tempered Lord rudely cut off performer-participants in Santa Monica who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ken readymades in order to screen videotaped comments by Camille Paglia and Raquel Welch . This event offered the audience no greater participation than seeing a film at the nearby Chelsea Multiplex . Why not cablecast it  --  live or taped  --  on that still much-needed art-world cable channel for performance and video art ? The Kitchen went on to produce close to two dozen on-line events throughout the ' ' 94- ' ' 95 season , some of them without the participation of the Electronic Cafe network . Perhaps the most resonant were two evenings of excerpts from Morton Sobotnik 's Angel Concerto , which the composer claims is the first full-scale electronic opera . 0n these occasions , teleconferencing flawlessly linked The Kitchen with Santa Monica 's Electronic Cafe and Studio X in Santa Fe , the studio of Kitchen founder Steina Vasulka . Dec. 3 : Bioinformatica The most ambitious on-line show of the season at a New York gallery  --  not that there was much competition  --  opened at Sandra Gering today . More accurately , " Bioinformatica " incorporated a central , on-line component among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The work of the X-Art Foundation collective ( which publishes Blast ) , " Bioinformatica " comprises a number of elements intended to blur the boundaries of real and virtual space . In the gallery itself , visitors can don vividly colored capes ( parangoles ) , which reinterpret the originals created by Helio Oiticica in the 1960s to encompass the body in spatial **29;98;TOOLONG sets . They can examine the Blast portfolio-publication , a series of bright-colored ovoid sculptures containing dozens of artists ' multiples , which accompanies the exhibition . Most crucially , gallery-goers can engage with those in an on-line cyber-gallery or real-time environment known as a MOO ( or Multi-user dungeon , Object Oriented  --  see below ) . An oversized projection of the computer screen on a gallery wall facilitates real-time interaction via keyboarded messages  --  or at least viewing  --  by more than one or two visitors at a time . Elaborating the on-line division of discussion areas into different " rooms , " this MOO ( actually a component of the University of Virginia 's ongoing postmodern-culture MOO ) includes a " lobby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " coffeeshop . " Ongoing chat takes place with other on-line visitors to a particular space . In the " coffeeshop " I encountered what might have been a virtual come-on ( in the form of on-screen text ) from " a hard working lad " with " gel glistening on his hair " and " tattered jeans " who was born in Montreal but " works like a dog in Toronto . " Two X-Art collective members distracted me with a demonstration of the wonders of MOO technology , which facilitates interactivity and playfully simulates various experiences largely through language , unlike the enveloping , visually oriented technology of virtual reality . Where the text-driven MOO differs from the common electronic chat line is in the sequences that have been programmed into it , and which are activated by viewers ' typed commands . The parangoles in the SoHo gallery , for instance , have their electronic counterparts in the gallery " space " of the MOO . Just as you can reach into the pocket of an actual parangole and retrieve a multiple from the Blast portfolio , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " into the pocket of the cyber-parangole causing a graphical map of the MOO to appear on-screen . ( This ability to manipulate such pre-programmed , textual " cyberobjects " is what gives the MOO its name . ) " Wakespace , " another interactive object in the cyber-gallery , is a " book " that you can " pick up . " Typing in a command activates a flow of text that seems to pour onto your screen like a passage from Finnegans Wake programmed by Jenny Holzer . But what I have been thinking of as representations strikes Jordan Crandall , an X-Art collective member , as something more  --  as the conflation of representation and reality the virtual and the real . " I 'm fascinated by the MOO 's assumption of objects  --  even bodies  --  in space , " he commented over coffee a week later , alluding to the series of responses and structured exchanges that have been built into the system in order to give users a kind of cyber-body . I commented that this notion of a " body " represented through electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts are equivalent , that imagery putatively degrading to women is rape . One question raised by projects like " Bioinformatica " is whether language will be capable of describing the new spaces and states-of-being that have arrived with the new telecommunications technology . Inaccurate and hyperbolic terminology  --  virtual reality is a prime offender  --  is an Orwellian slippery slope that is likely to lead to far more than rhetorical consequences . Dec. 28 : Censor Sensibility The New Museum of Contemporary Art threw a birthday party for Bob Flanagan tonight in conjunction with " Visiting Hours , " his harrowing **26;129;TOOLONG made in collaboration with Sheree Rose . At one point , Flanagan , whose work explores the varied meanings of physical pain , lay naked on a bed of nails while opening presents . A stringer for Hot Wired ( Wired 's Internet publication at http : //www.hotwired.com ) shot digital photos of the festive goings-on for Internet transmission . I ca n't help musing that although the far-from-conventional party and show are not NEA-funded , that hardly immunizes them against assault by federal and state officials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judiciary has already taken up the regulation of images on the Internet . As early as July 1994 , Robert and Carleen Thomas , operators of a BBS in California , were convicted on obscenity charges after a federal agent in Memphis downloaded " patently offensive " images . ( Many observers assume that the feds selected the Tennessee location in order to apply the area 's conservative community standards to the case . ) The Thomases are currently in federal prison , while their appeals are pending . Nor have image-free text-postings escaped the attention of regulators . This year , in February , University of Michigan student Jake Baker was arrested for posting a story called " Pamela 's Ordeal " to the Internet news group " alt.sex.stories . " He made the mistake of using a classmate 's name in his narrative about torture and domination , although he had never spoken to her . ( A Michigan alum who happened to be in Moscow alerted university officials to Baker 's posting . ) According to Andrew Taubman , executive director of the Electronic Freedom Foundation  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usenet group that had other similar postings . They accepted it as a type of writing that is acceptable under their community standards . " A federal judge dismissed charges against Baker on June 21 . On June 15 , the Senate passed a bill mandating fines of up to $100,000 and prison terms for people who knowingly transmit indecent material over a computer network accessible to people under age 18 ( even though " indecency " is a concept that lacks precise legal meaning ) . The same month , some senators actually suggested that the Net bore some responsibility for the May 1995 bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City . At a hearing on the bombing , Senator Dianne Feinstein , a moderate Democrat , took issue with First Amendment advocates who had defended the inclusion of information about bomb-building on the Net  --  information that is already widely available in libraries . Given the current , increasingly inhospitable climate for free speech , it appears that the struggle to tend long-established First Amendment rights to cyberspace will be a lengthy one . Jan. 9 , 1995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Museum at Berkeley ( http : **25;157;TOOLONG ) is among the most substantial of any American art museum 's Internet offerings . It was timed to go on line in connection with " In A Different Light , " the museum 's examination of so-called queer sensibility , which has brought me to Berkeley see A.i.A. , July ' ' 95 . Featuring color images and meaty chunks of text , the museum 's Web site was available before the actual catalogue , which was not ready for the exhibition 's opening . The on-line texts are enhanced by useful hypertext links  --  the Queer Resource Directory can be accessed with the click of a mouse from the show 's " Family " section , the Safe Sex Web site from the " Orgy " section , and so on . These valuable links are likely to reach  --  and perhaps educate  --  a nonart audience of gay men and lesbians who will be attracted to the site for its queer content . Unfortunately , most museums seem to regard their Internet outposts mainly as vehicles for the dissemination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction . At the critics ' panel at MOMA on Apr. 10 , Dia Center for the Arts director Michael Govan noted that Dia 's primary motive for establishing its site ( http : //www.diacenter.org ) was to more efficiently spread the word about Dia programs to an international audience . This should probably come as no surprise in an era when nearly every museum 's publicity director has been renamed " director of communications . " ( The Dia site features Tony Oursler 's and Constance de Jong 's Fantastic Prayers performance , but its fragmented video clips and performance stills do n't add up to much . ) Even the Whitney , under the direction of new-media aficionado David Ross , offers little innovative programming on its Web branch ( http : // www.echonyc.com/ ( symbol omitted ) whitney ) , At its best , it presents an irresistible artist 's project by Conceptualist and former California gubernatorial candidate Lowell Darling culled from his Hollywood Archaeology archive of enigmatic found photos . ( The text-and-image amalgams of photo-conceptualism are perfectly suited to digital reproduction . ) At its worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by soliciting users to click onto the Whitney 's Web site from The File Room 's guestbook  --  normally a place for comments . ( No permissions are required for catching this sort of interactivity . ) Instead of confronting its own record on censorship  --  every museum has one  --  the Whitney simply offered a side trip to its site . The most stimulating exception to the U.S. museum world 's lack of imagination in Internet programming is the interactive examination in text form of the ethics of bioengineering ( http : //www. exploratorium.edu/ ) which complemented the " Diving Into the Gene Pool " exhibition ( it closed on Sept. 4 ) at the Exploratorium-San Francisco 's museum of hands-on science and art . If an on-line model for American museums exists , it is the program at the state-supported French museums . These well-financed institutions have collectively staked out a more sophisticated Internet presence than any of their counterparts throughout the world . The constantly expanding Louvre site ( http : **32;184;TOOLONG musee ) offers images of works from the collection , floor plans of the museum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibitions . Even so , the most conceptually and visually rewarding World Wide Web site to appear this year is the French Ministry of Culture 's showcase for the Paleolithic cave paintings found in the Ardeche . The caves were discovered last Christmas and the Web site  --  with four gorgeous reproductions from the closed-to-the-public caves  --  was up less than two months later ( http : **25;218;TOOLONG gvpda-en.html ) . Ironically , while American museums ' education , publication , conservation and communications departments have already , in many cases , gone digital , few contemporary-art curators have shown electronic  --  much less on-line  --  art works . Interested individuals like former New Museum curator Laura Trippi or the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art 's Robert Riley have already presented digital-format works with on-line components , but they seem wary of placing computer terminals in museum galleries . By contrast , Karlsruhe , Germany , is completing an art and media-technology center ( Zentrum fuer Kunst und Medientechnologie ) that will include a museum devoted primarily to video- and electronic art of the past 25 years . ( Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jan. 30 : Multi-Purposing On Disk and On Line The multimedia world 's been buzzing this week : As some commentators predicted , the Christmas sales figures on CD-Roms were disastrous . The disks , most of them produced independently , suffered from distribution and marketing problems , and from their related reliance on sweat equity , rather than the financial involvement of established publishers . Many observers believe that this off-line digital format is transitional and that the real explosion of electronic , multimedia publishing will be located on the Internet ( Many journals and magazines have already migrated there ; secure electronic billing is imminent . ) My recent experience is typical : Abbeville , the publisher of my contemporary- and modern-art guides  --  ArtSpeak and ArtSpoke  --  is ambivalent about spending the several hundred thousand dollars necessary to produce a CD-Rom version . The cost of rights for the 1,000-or-so desired images is just one stumbling block . But there 'd be little point in " repurposing " an art book for CD-Rom without such visual fireworks or , as the MBAs say , without adding value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer files necessary for CD-Rom production can be repurposed for on-line viewing , many artists are pursuing strategies that obviate translating a work conceived for one format into another . David Blair 's landmark Waxweb ( **30;272;TOOLONG ) is far more than a repurposed version of his 1991 film Wax ; Blair suggests thinking of it as " a triple CD shareware version of the film made available to you across the Internet . " It encompasses the entire , obsessively disjunctive art film about James Hivemaker , a World War I-era " spiritualist cinematographer " and peripatic collector of images of the dead , in 4,800 color stills , 560 video clips , and 2,200 audio clips available in multiple languages . Viewers can travel through this dreamy narrative shot by shot , or they can see all of the film 's stills sorted into eccentric categories that constitute a downright Baldessari-esque perspective on the filmed imagery . Occupying a gargantuan 1.5 gigabytes of hard disk space , it is , according to Blair , the largest hypermedia narrative document on the Internet . Other artists are pursuing multi-purposing rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'Agostino conceived his recent installation TRACES ( between the bombs ) as both a site-specific installation and a hypertext World Wide Web project ( http : //www.temple.edu/ ( symbol omitted ) traces ) . Incorporating childhood home movies , video footage of Hiroshima 's annual peace ceremonies , and archival imagery , TRACES is a disquieting meditation on the ultimate weapon of destruction . The installation multi-purposing approach is also the favored m.o . of electronically inclined installation artists such as Perry Hoberman and Lynn Hershman-Leeson . March 2 : Programming Women Today K reminded me that it 's Women 's History Month , an occasion no longer much noticed  --  for good and bad  --  in the art world . It 's easy to assume that few women are involved with on-line art : high technology , after all , is the quintessential boy 's toy . But happily the assumption does n't hold up . K 's reminder did get me thinking about women and electronic art production as I walked to artist Cati Laporte 's East Village apartment for a demonstration of her work . Laporte , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public to commit criminal acts with her faux postage stamps commemorating the darker side of the American psyche and body politic . ( Postal patrons who use her stamps rather than the real thing are subject to fines . ) Alleged Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh ( " Homegrown Terrorist " ) and Amy Fisher are some of her stamp-portrait subjects , many of which are visible on her Web site ( http : //razorfish. com/bluedot/fire ) . But Laporte 's stamps are gummed objects , while another of her projects , The Living Almanac of Disasters ( which can be reached through the same Web site ) recontextualizes similar material conceived directly for the Net . Every day brings another bummer in this worst of all possible worlds ; today , for instance , she offers the calamatous 1911 fire in the Triangle Shirtwaist factory that killed 150 women , illustrated by a news photo . Susan Farrell has also produced an intriguing body of work for the Web . Farrell 's archivelike Art Crimes project ( http : //www.gatech.edu/desoto/ graf/Index ) is a collection of handsome photos of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images the Georgia student had shot in Atlanta and Prague . It registered 172,000 " hits "  --  or accesses  --  during its first two months on line . Four months later the gallery had mushroomed to 700 photos of graffiti from 22 cities . It is also a sort of clubhouse for an international group of underground artists . Other notable projects by women are Victoria Vezna 's Virtual Concrete ( http : **25;304;TOOLONG html ) , which offers viewers a chance to " order " and " pick up " a custom-designed , virtual body via e-mail , and Nina Sobell and Emily Hartzell 's Park Bench ( see below ) . Apr. 4 : The Robotic Eye and the Park Bench Nina Sobell and Emily Hartzell are artists-in-residence at New York University 's Center for Digital Multimedia , where I visited them last night . This institutional affiliation affords them access to a high-tech camera in a robotic " eye " with can be steered by observers moving their mouses ; regular Monday-night **26;331;TOOLONG are visible at 10 p.m. on the center 's Web site ( http : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Giacometti-esque clay figure yields pictures of the artist at work from a variety of selected perspectives . It 's the kindof gee-whiz technology that conjures up visions of European surgeons watching their American counterparts perform a tricky new procedure . For Sobel and Hartzell , however , the Monday-night events are research for their Park Bench project . With assistance from New York City 's board of education , Sobell and Hartzell plan to bring a network of interactive computer kiosks to heavily trafficked public sites like Penn Station by 1996 . Kiosk users will be able to surf the Internet for free , get neighborhood news and tourist information , and communicate via video link with the users of other kiosks . These **27;400;TOOLONG also seem to fulfill the late ' ' 60s promise of genuinely interactive communication via then.newly affordable video technology . Is that Nam June Paik sitting on this bench ? Apr. 17 : Alternative ( Cyber ) Space I received the New York Foundation for the Arts ' survey called " The State of the Digital Arts " in the mail today . The detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic equipment and training , as well as the possibilities for showing and distributing digital art works . It 's an impressive efforf to quantify genuine need at a time when arts funding cuts are often made on the basis of dotty anecdotes and crackpoot assumptions . Getting the survey also made me want to take another look at Arts Wire ( http : //www.tmn.com/ **25;429;TOOLONG ) , the three-year-old grant-and member-funded network NYFA operates . It 's grown explosively since I first saw it demonstrated in 1993 . Widey consided the largest arts network on line , Arts Wire 's importance as a repository of vital information and as a center for progressive cultural concerns is sure to increase as the National Endowment for the Arts fades into oblivion . Organizations such as the National Association of Artists ' Organizations ( NAAO ) , Visual AIDS , the National Campaign for Freedom of Expression and numerous state arts councils are among Arts Wire 's 600 members . But arts administrators are n't Arts Wire 's only constituency . Artist-users with down-to-earth needs can also scour grant deadlines , news items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handy source of up-to-date arts info . ) I particularly enjoyed a look at the Artists ' Conference , which provides a place for artmakers to post messages on topics ranging from the purely practical ( dealing with commercial galleries ) to the sublimely soulful ( recalling teachers , mentors and influences ) . Arts Wire is also the site of a few artists ' " home pages "  --  the introductory texts and graphics that open Web documents and are often merely expanded resumes and slide sheets . Photo-conceptualist Jeff Gates applied his wry sensibility to his site-as-self-portrait . State-of-the-art graphics and autobiographical text-and-photo pieces embellish his mini-memoir in the rhetorical style of Spalding Gray . ( Another amusing work by Gates , Everyone Has a Twin , is visible at http : // **38;456;TOOLONG ) . Apr. 23 : Virtual Community The New York Times ran a piece today about the late futurist and computer networking specialist Tom Mandel , who went on line with his fatal , five-month long struggle with lung cancer . The current buzzword for describing such ongoing electronic intercourse is " virtual community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  as in the art community , the gay community or the Latino community  --  is the most telling indicator of the real thing 's increasing scarcity in American life . Perhaps the single most surprising feature of electronic society is its sociability , which comes in various forms . Wolfgang Staehle noted that he used to meet the denizens of The Thing at Odeon , the Tribeca restaurant and art-world watering hole , but now he meets them on line . Non-virtual electronic gatherings are ubiquitous as well . Echo hosts frequent readings at downtown Manhattan performance spaces and old-fashioned mixers at clubs and bars . attended one packed and smoky Echo gathering at the downtown Art Bar which was entirely unremarkable save for a conversation with a Wall Street broker who 'd skipped work that day to write an anti-censorship screed that he 'd already posted to a news group . Commercial service providers ' motives for fostering such get-togethers come into play , of course , but it would be a mistake to underestimate the desire for connectedness that is literally embodied in the technology of computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on America Online , " blared the computer-screen announcement for an on-line chat with the renowned artist tonight . I opted to monitor the discussion on line , although I 'd also been invited to the real event at the ( at ) Cafe in the East Village , which was being held to celebrate Holzer 's new work Please Change Beliefs , located on a new site for electronic art called ada " web ( http : // adaweb.com ) . ( One can contribute aphorisms to Holzer 's largely repurposed work on the ada " web ; or take in Securityland , a more compelling project by surveillance artist Julia Scher . ) Getting stars like Holzer to work on the Web is perhaps the most attention-grabbing  --  albeit not necessarily the most esthetically satisfying  --  way to generate interest in art works on the Net . Alas , the chat session on AOL was ludicrous . Holzer was n't really fast enough on her fingers to enlarge on the often simplistic questions posed to her . She probably had no idea of how the technology undermined her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only her remarks on their computer screens , but those of a dozen fellow audience members ( virtually ) seated in the same ( virtual ) row in America Online 's ( virtual ) auditorium known as the Odeon ( not to be confused with the Tribeca restaurant ) or " the People Connection . " The on-screen chat I saw from my " row " consisted primarily of Beavis and Butthead-style remarks supplied by audience members who understood neither Holzer nor her art . But the technology , as a young houseguest watching with me remarked , is " awesome . " In any case , no more than 70 subscribers were simulaneously logged on during the session . ( AOL thoughtfully provides this info at the top of your screen ) . I had naively assumed there would be thousands . Perhaps the promise of " niche " programming  --  something for everybody  --  that cable television once seemed to offer will be fulfilled on the Internet . June 20 : PostScript Will the Inteet revolutionize art production ? By the end of the season , it remains unclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the one hand , virtuality seems to have little place in a system predicated on materiality . On the other , conceptualist and neo-conceptualist approaches are again driving contemporary art . This will encourage the creation of interactive works especially suited for on-line production and distribution ; as will technological advances like the new VRML ( Virtual Reality Modeling Language ) . Ultimately , however , non-art-world forces will fuel the push toward on-line art . As upscale American households increasingly go on line , they will constitute an audience that is simply too large for information-age artists to ignore . And why would they want to ? Recent crops of art-school graduates must confront the Malthusian dilemma of a burgeoning number of artists facing a static  --  or contracting  --  art market . Raised on television and the near-conflation of pop culture with so much postmodern art , many are also likey to welcome the prospect of finding mass audiences for their work . They will share this populist vision with many of their conceptualist , baby-boomer peers . As this handwriting on the studio wall grows clearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Contemporary artists have long attempted to shake things up with non-traditional formats such as earthworks , performances and video art  --  all of which seem far less digestible than on-line art . But to no avail . The art ecosystem has proved , over the course of the 20th century , to be remarkaby adaptable . Is this economically straightened time different ? As the millennium approaches , the current onslaught of bits and bytes may be just the tonic the art world needs . Author : Robert Atkins 's most recent book is ArtSpoke : A Guide to Modern Ideas , Movements and Buzzwords ( 1848-1944 ) . This month he assumes the new position of editor/director of TalkBack A Forum for Critical Discourse at http : **26;496;TOOLONG . He can be reached via e-mail at ratkins(at)echonyc.com . GETTING AROUND The boom in Internet art activity has largely taken place on the World Wide Web ( WWW ) . Its hypertext technology allows users to clidk on a delineated word or image " hotspot " in one document to link it to another document  --  which may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet . The Web 's recent success derives from the user-friendly , point-and-click graphical interfaces of the software needed for Web navigation , which are known as browsers . The pioneering development of a graphical Web browser took place at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois and culminated in the release of the Web browser Mosaic in January 1993 . ( Today Mosaic has been eclipsed by the faster Netscape browser . ) But at the moment , " surfing " the Internet is like gallery-going in SoHo with no guide . The compilation and indexing of information is a rapidly emerging cyber growth industry . A dozen or so museum indexes or lists already exist . The most complete is the Virtual Library 's Museum Pages ( http : //www. **42;524;TOOLONG ) , which is subdivided into lists from the U.S. , the U.K. and the rest of the world . Its definition of museums is quite broad and includes univeristy galleries and the Getty 's remarkable Art History Information Program or AHIP ( htto : **25;568;TOOLONG ) , which facilitates middle-of-the-night bibliographical searches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repertory of the Literature of Art , or RILA . ) WorldWide Arts Resources ( http : **47;595;TOOLONG ) indexes institutional and noninstitutional offerings . Its staggering range extends from Frida Kahlo and Christo/Jean-Claude to Harold Edgerton 's On-Line Photo Gallery and the remarkable Fluxus site featuring live-art gems like a warbling Yoko Ono ( http : //anansi.panix.com:80/ fluxus/ ) . Numerous search " engines " or key word searches also exist . Three giants of the field  --  Lycos , WebCrawler , and InfoSeek  --  are available by clicking on the Net Search button of Netscape . My favorite is the wonderfully named WebCrawler ( http : //webcrawler.com ) . While searching for Laurie Anderson 's sites , I misspelled her name Laure Anderson and pulled up a female bodybuilder 's home page . Correctly spelled , Laurie Anderson elicited 78 document citations , most of them by fans who have cited the performance artist on their sites . More sophisticated search engines are no doubt under development , but the Web 's hypertext technology characteristically yields deliriously surrealistic results . Net surfing is also invariably frustrating . During a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artificial intelligence expert Pamela McCorduck on May 11 , the latter laughingly complained : " I am always disappointed by the technology . I 've spent 30 years saying to engineers , " Is this all this can do ? ' ' " Gibson retorted , " If I 'd known what I know now when writing Neuromancer , the technology would never have worked so well . " In fact , when one is on line , systems inevitably and inexplicably fail : a network goes down , an e-mail file crashes , a Web site is unreachable because too many other computer users have already accessed it , or because long-distance lines are overwhelmed by caller traffic . A bit of advice : On the East Coast , Internet access is much faster in the morning , before Californians have gone on line . <p>
