IT 'S FEAST AND FAMINE WHEN THREE GENERATIONS SIT DOWN TO SUPPER . A FAMILY SAGA WRITTEN IN SQUID INK . <p> THIS IS CHRISTMASTIME . THE RESTAURANT 'S AIR IS POLISHED WITH REFLECTIONS from bright Italian ornaments-red spindles , widemouthed angels , a donkey stamped from tin-but otherwise sits unchanged . To the Amalfi 's waiters , the odor of this air is ordinary , sharp with tomato and full of steam . Sometimes when the kitchen door opens , a foul waft comes through over to table 12 : the scent of old mussel shells rotting in their juice . Paolo , the maitre d ' , always puts old people at table 12 because they can not smell anything and can not taste anything . This evening at 12 , an old man sits , folding white napkins into rabbits . Paolo keeps supplying him with the napkins . The ice coating the old man 's shoulders is melting into the tweed , and he orders minestrone to warm himself . Table 7 is open for a party of five . A family . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six-they have miscounted somehow . Charlene Flynn has counted her twin sons as one child . So , soon , another chair will have to be hunted up for the extra four-year-old . His name is Danny , and he will order , at the climax of the evening , a plate of " Calamari cooked in its own ink . " When the boy orders this simple squid , Paolo will notice a strange horror from the adults at the table . Paolo will wonder about these looks all night , wonder what could be so terrible about a little boy 's whim . Photograph <p> The Flynns are getting in the car . The car is still outside their house , surrounded by puffs of snow on either side , the thriftiest kind of snow . In Washington , the mayor has not allotted money for snowplows , so its fallen shapes will remain . The Flynns are all in snow jackets of artificial fibers , clutching themselves and thinking how clear and deadly the night air is-that if it drops one more degree the Flynns will freeze up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-hugging positions of fear . But , in fact , they are n't all Flynns ; two are Hagertons , Charlene 's parents visiting from Georgia . Fred Hagerton is talking to Alan Flynn about the car itself , a deep-blue Dodge Dart , a used car . They are discussing the advantages of a new car , and Alan Flynn is thinking that he and his wife can not afford it , a new car , that his whole life his family has never had a new car . Fred Hagerton drives a new Cadillac . He and his wife also can not afford it , on his butcher 's salary , but they are getting old , and when Fred went to war he promised Leona a new Cadillac one day if he lived , and he lived , and so he drives a new Cadillac . Where is Leona ? Still in the house . A small house , a first house . Mostly living room . A high coffee table sits in the middle , tiled with burnt-yellow squares , and around it are pieces of wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were babies , a dining-room chair set out for company , the lusterless leather couch with wings of teak ( the great luxury of the room , the new Cadillac of the Flynns ) . A spider plant hangs above in a beaded macrame cradle . The walls of the room are thin and white . Paintings of abstract orange flowers cheer feebly above the couch . Leona Hagerton , Charlene 's mother , is bent over the coffee table . Her thin hair , dyed a believable red and teased into a dull hot-air balloon of lacquer , catches the fluorescent light . It becomes a glowing nest . She leans over her purse and inserts a letter . It is a letter from soon-to-be-president Jimmy Carter , her boy from Georgia . It is an invitation to his ball in Atlanta . She is bringing it to the restaurant as evidence . It is to be used in her story of why she loves Jimmy Carter so . He invites her , little Leona Hagerton who dresses so poorly that she shivers in her long coat even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , everybody in Georgia gets these invitations . But that 's wrong . Jimmy Carter 's election is in November of 1976 . But the twins were born in 197o and can not be six . Danny can not order the squid at six and still seem to augur an unexpected , harder life . No , the story is wrong . The twins are four . But let it go . Let her be inserting a letter from Jimmy Carter nonetheless . It does n't matter . Charlene is in a gray dress to please her mother , Leona . Leona has always forbidden her girls to wear red . It draws attention ; it is the color of a whore . Charlene wears thick glasses and pats the heads of her twin sons . Her hair is barretted above her ears , and she is afraid it makes her nose larger . Her father , Fred , once told her she had a Roman nose : " It roams all over your face ! " He always made her sing for guests . I remember that , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : lively and brutal . So Fred and Leona have to be her parents , after all . They could never be Flynns . Leona wears a pale-green pantsuit she bought at Sears . She is thin as a blade of grass . Her face is made up in pinks from Avon ; she sells Avon back in Augusta , Georgia . For Christmas , she will give her daughter Avon perfume and the twins Avon Batman hairbrushes . She is worried , talking furiously about her neighbors to her daughter , although Charlene does not know her neighbors . This loud worrying comforts Leona . She would never speak of this comfort . Sometimes , she asks Fred a question- " Is n't that right , Fred ? " or " What was her name , Fred ? " - but he does n't reply and she does n't expect him to . Fred does n't talk , does n't tell stories anymore , or make his daughters sing , or bring home funny strangers to dinner . In 1g6o , a man came to the door , holding his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlene overheard the news : Two women had died in a car crash in Kentucky . She learned that this was her father 's first family , a wife and daughter he 'd left for Leona twenty years before . Charlene shouted her rage at him for keeping it a secret , this whole other family he 'd abandoned as a young man . Leona left the room , but Fred took his daughter 's fury . He stared at her red face and flying ponytail and began to shake . Perhaps he moved , in that moment , from the half of life when you build things to the half of life when they fall apart . Afterward , people would say he seemed " touched , " perhaps had come undone . Fred hushed and became this man , this kind , silent , dopey man in the front seat , just smiling without a word . Fifteen years from now , Charlene will leave her own family , Alan and the grown-up twins . Her father , Fred , will mail her all his butcher knives , dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the defiant one who died in that car crash , who sends them . Charlene will open the tissue paper , kneeling , put a hand to her mouth , and swallow wordless grief . But they are all dressed up tonight ! The twins are finally speaking in their secret language , because no one else is talking to them . You would never be able to tell , but they are making up a story . It 's about a green boy lost in a house and all the ghosts around him , but there 's another little boy there , also green , so it 's not so bad , it 's never so bad , then . Here 's what they sound like : " Babba bitty boy gitta ghosty house , gitta ghosty babba round . . . " They sound like babies . They have n't thought yet about the restaurant , or being hungry or being cold , or the snot drying on their noses . Danny has n't planned that he will order the fateful squid . But wait-why Danny ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squid ? They dress alike , talk the same languages , tell the same stories . At four years old , they are the focus of each other 's world , so why would n't they both order the squid ? They are becoming different already . Marky , for instance , is very shy . He hides his red nose deep inside the fake-fleece hood of his coat . He lets Danny tell the frame of the ghost story . Marky knows the details and adds them only when necessary : a green boy . He likes to run very fast . He despises mushrooms-his father jokes that this is because he dropped Marky on his head as a baby . Danny is louder , standing in the middle and yelling , La ! La ! La ! until a parent notices him or Marky joins in . When he was three , he drew a picture of himself as a girl . Charlene found it . Danny got to see a psychoanalyst at only three . The man said not to worry , that Danny must have looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daycare , his grandparents , Donny and Marie Osmond-and thought that since Marky was obviously male , he must be female . This explanation did not dispel Charlene and Alan 's worries . So the psychoanalyst gave them a book called Growing Up Straight . Leona knows about the drawing and the psychoanalyst . Charlene regrets telling her about it in her own , inherited , fit of worrying . And Leona is weird about it . She 's told Alan that when she was a little girl , all boys of three wore frilly dresses and curled their hair . That is to say , all children did . Boys grew out of it , and girls never did , and the time to worry was later . Alan glared at Charlene during this speech . And Leona has begun on this trip to pay a lot of attention to Danny , which is exactly what Growing Up Straight says not to do . Charlene is going to talk to her about it . So there is already a subtlety to the twins . There is something quiet about Marky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaware of all this . Marky does not remember being dropped on his head , and Danny already does n't remember the psychoanalyst or the drawing , which has been thrown away . Here 's all they say : " Babba bother bitty boy bidda ghosty house . " And Leona is still talking . She is telling of her neighbor who puts up green tomatoes so that this time of year all of the cul-de-sac can eat relishes for Christmas . She tells of an Indian family who moved in down the street who gave Leona a bottle of chutney . Leona did not know what to do with it ; it was not relish . She had no interest in it . But her sewing partner , Wilma , got all excited just to see it . So Leona gave it to her , because she seemed to want it , but she feels sorry for Wilma . Wilma only gets excitement out of new and different things . But Wilma is very sad . Leona says she thinks it 's fine to be brave , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred nods and smiles at this story . He 's heard it before , and likes it this time , too . And the car turns the corner and stops . The Flynns have arrived at the Amalfi ! Now they have to get out in the cold again . There is a moment of hesitation when Leona has to choose between the cramped backseat of the Dodge Dart or the frozen air outside . But everyone else is already outside . The twins are dancing around near the bumper , their mittens twirling from their wrists , and they have to be rounded up . Outside , the Amalfi is dark brick with an archway entrance . Dirty yellow lanterns light the side , and the windows are diamond-paned and multicolored . This , Leona thinks , is what a real Italian restaurant should look like . Photograph <p> The boys throw off their coats inside . They , too , are dressed up : both in ruffled shirts . Marky and Danny have wanted ruffled shirts for a whole year now , and Alan had to search all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the boys saw them . Marky 's shirt is pink ; Danny 's is light blue . The boys are always color-coded this way : Marky red ; Danny blue . Their whole lives , the twins will claim each , respectively , in all honesty , as their favorite color . Paolo guesses that these are the Flynns . The old man is eating his pear now , after letting the port seep in . Paolo admires the man for his imagination . Paolo walks up , smiling fiercely , with five menus . Coats are being flung onto hooks , and all of the Flynns are red-cheeked , eyebrows high as if surprised by the cold . Charlene explains that they are six . She must have counted the twins as one . Leona pinches Danny 's cheek and jokes that they almost forgot him . Danny stares at his beehived grandmother . Another waiter is sent to get the extra chair for the dangerous twin . Again , all is Christmas inside the Amalfi . A Christmas tree studded with electric candles , the dented Italian ornaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strung everywhere . The tables spiral out from the tree : two white tablecloths draped at diagonals to each other . Paolo insists on the two cloths when he is maitre d ' . He saw it once in a magazine . Leona is mildly flirtatious with Paolo . He smells her Avon perfume and can tell she has dressed up for the Amalfi . She tells him how handsome he is , even touches his cheek with a pink fingernail . And he is handsome ; he has a Roman nose . Leona clicks her tongue when she notices he wears no wedding ring . Do n't Italian boys get married young ? she asks . Paolo blushes , but under his dark skin , so no one can tell . The Anglo Flynns are blushing openly , though , blushing from the cold as if afire . Paolo does n't answer her question but smiles and gracefully passes out the menus . Danny and Marky are speaking in their secret language . Alan makes them stop . Paolo has left to help the old man at table 12 get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the cold ! and chuckles . Paolo nods . At table 7 , Fred has begun to talk . Everyone else is quiet , watching , their faces pinched with curiosity that he would speak . Even Leona is silent . He is talking about how all his family were musicians . This has come out of nowhere . He is motioning slowly with his red butcher 's hands , rowing through the tin-lit air , telling of the ragged South Carolina porch of his old house and how all his brothers would wake up Sunday mornings , polish their instruments , and sit in a row to play for the people going to church . He must have been three or four , and Fred describes himself as " no bigger than a cricket . " He remembers most clearly the cedar crate of instruments and his siblings reaching in , not for any particular one , but for whatever first touched skin . They worked with whatever they picked up-trombones and little Jew 's harps , a concertina and a limberjack . They could play anything in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fred remembered how one day a Negro family walked up early in the Sunday morning with a viola in a case . Even Fred could tell that they were poor , poorer even than the Hagertons on their leaning , waterlogged porch . They had been left this viola by a grandfather , and not one of them had ever heard it played . And how his tall brother Furman lifted it from their hands , carefully undid the case , brought out that shining thing , and played it all morning . Fred fingers the table when he talks . He pushes the words through his sullen lips with concentration . This is not babbling ; this is the storytelling of a man who knows his quiet 's coming on again . He goes on , though , tells how he was so young then , dizzy on those raucous Sundays , and by the time he was ten all his brothers and sisters had grown up , with porches and dull children of their own , had sold the instruments for flour and sugar and beer . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , that happiest time , they all denied it . They said he 'd made it up , made up the whole story . Their frivolous musical youth was an embarrassment , you see , a workingman 's embarrassment . Certainly , no one knows what to say to this . The tin ornaments clink in the silence . Charlene will remember this speech when the butcher knives come in the mail . It will be a time to regret things . Luckily , Paolo comes back with a little white pad , and chattering indecision commences . Leona finally chooses the spaghetti . Her daughter has the veal scallopini and so does Alan . Marky gets lots of meatballs , and one can see in his quiet face a joy at the thought of them . Fred is looking down at his empty plate . Leona orders spaghetti for him , too . He does n't like any other Italian food , she explains to Paolo . Fred says nothing to protest . And Danny , Danny has the menu propped up in his chubby fingers . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink tip of his tongue peeking out between his lips . He is concentrating . He sees a line that says , " Calamari cooked in its own ink " and he can not imagine what it could be . Certainly nothing his grandmother has ever cooked for him , or his mother . Maybe he imagines a fiddler simmering in the broth of his own song . He puts the menu down on the white double cloths . New silver is sparkling in Paolo 's hand . Danny opens his mouth , and Paolo can see there on that pink tongue , rolling like a beveled ruby bead , a prophecy .
