<p> Laureano " Peanut " Faedi ca n't get free of the Club Deluxe dance floor . He is 5 feet 2 and 90 pounds , without much to sweat away . But when he tries to get air , some bob-haired pixie twice his size with half his flair drags him into another round of dips and twirls in the West Coast Swing . <p> " Peanut , he 's got it down , " observes Ed Bruin , 31 , a cabbie with thin sideburns and a seersucker sports coat . " In fact , the big girls from Santa Rosa like to flip him . It 's a real crowd-pleaser . " <p> Up front , Vise Grip , the leader of the jump-swing band St. Vitus Dance , has worked the crowd into a sing-along froth for Cab Calloway 's " Minnie the Moocher . " <p> " Hidy , hidy hi , " Grip roars to an audience dressed as if this were the Cotton Club Deluxe . Martinis and cosmopolitans are clinking , and the suspendered , wide- tied bartenders flick silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Friday night the 1940s have returned to this retro bar in the Haight , where the ' 60s are still the decade of choice , the ' 70s are tired , the ' 50s have been done , the ' 80s are of no interest and the ' 90s are n't worth the bother . <p> " Hidy , hidy , hidy ho . " At his rate of exertion , Grip , a.k.a . Larry Castle , 47 , will soon have to remove his fur felt homburg and squeegee his bald head . But first he segues into the dance theme " It Do n't Mean a Thing If It Ai n't Got that Swing . " <p> That 's true of Peanut , the big girls from Santa Rosa ( who flip each other when he 's unavailable ) and a subculture of nightclubbers who prefer to live 50 years behind the times . <p> " It 's an every-day thing , not just Friday nights , " explains graphic artist Michael Moss , 31 , whose double-breasted gabardine suit , rayon tie and Resistal fedora get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the discomfort . <p> " It 's an old aesthetic , but with everyone getting their heads pierced , we just like to do something a little more elegant . It 's a big scene too . " <p> So big that Bimbo 's 365 Club in North Beach fills to its 600-person capacity for anything with emblemed bass drum , sassy horns and a finger-snapping , romance-dripping crooner on a grill-front Sure 58 microphone . <p> " When they come over here it 's an event . The suits and the greased-back hair and pompadours , drinking martinis , the whole bit , " says Michael Cerchiai , 34 , third-generation proprietor of Bimbo 's . " These people , they want to dance , and that 's just the bottom line . The dance floor is packed . " <p> This weekend , the Brian Setzer Orchestra , a 17-piece big band backing Setzer 's electric guitar , will play the club , with St. Vitus opening on Friday . The 1930s gin house blues of Lavay Smith and the Red Hot Skillet Lickers will open Saturday 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hesla Big Band will blow ' 30s Count Basie and Duke Ellington in the basement of Cafe Du Nord on Market Street to launch a monthly series . <p> " Music is changing from the rock and roll days , where it had a rebellious identity , to a cultural phenomenon , where it 's spanning races and generations , " says Jon Varnedoe , co-owner of Du Nord , where Lavay Smith 's Saturday night dinner shows are selling out a week in advance . " It 's a total change in the perception of what music is . " <p> Setzer , the former Stray Cat singer who rode rockabilly into the ' 80s , is stepping farther back this decade . <p> ' NEVER HEARD BEFORE ' <p> " You can go out every night and hear three electric guitars knocking each other over the head , " says Setzer , 35 , who presumes his sound to be the only rock guitar accompanied by full orchestra . " This is something they 've never heard before . " <p> Setzer , who sings like Bobby Darin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took a ride across town to sample Bimbo 's charm , and booked a return gig . <p> " I saw Bimbo 's and I thought , ' Oh , we have to play here . This is just made for us , ' " he says . " The room is so classy . It 's got a dance floor . It 's got those red leather seats . It 's not some square box . " <p> Last month the club was jammed for Sam Butera , a legendary Las Vegas lounge act . <p> " The older people who came were just shocked by the number of young people , " says Cerchiai , " and the Club Deluxe is the breeding ground for these bands . " <p> Particularly when Vise and his squad , known as the " Sex Pistols of Swing " for their intense presentation , play their weekly gig . People arrive done up as if it were a tea dance . <p> " Eight months ago there were two people dancing here , that 's all you ever saw , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Rafael waiter who was issued the nickname by a bartender who thought Laureano Faedi a bit stiff for a swinger . <p> SMOOTH STEPS <p> In his spats and high-waist pants with lucky red dice from Vegas dangling from a chain , Peanut has the smoothest steps in the house . When he finally makes it outside to cool his hair pomade , women follow him out for lessons and to practice flipping him , back to back then over , right there on the Haight Street sidewalk . <p> Out on the street , Deadhead skateboarders in tie-dye zip through groups of men their age in custom zoot suits with pocket squares , French-cuff shirts and vintage cuff links . <p> A woman in harlequin glasses admits to " over-accessorizing , " with lime green cigarets to match her evening gloves . The preferred smokes are Lucky Strikes . Mike Moss knows . He bought an antique case from the ' 30s , with a Strike still in it . He 's now looking for a tailor and a ' 47 Caddy . That 's how deep the retro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were even SOMA warehouse speakeasies with St. Vitus playing after hours . <p> INNOCENT ERA <p> " Mint cocktails till 5 or 6 in the morning , " says Moss , already longing for that innocent era , which is rumored to be returning to a secret location after the Saturday night Setzer show . <p> Mr. Rick 's Martini Club , an offshoot of the Art Deco Society , has a few hundred members and special events that are going monthly by popular demand . <p> " Haight Street has all the vintage clothing stores , and that 's a good point of entry , " says member Laurie Gordon , who has noticed the swing era seeping back into pop culture via video and film . " People get that image before them and want to act it out . " <p> Ed Bruin fell under the jump-swing spell when he stumbled into the Paradise Lounge and caught St. Vitus . <p> " I was really hung over , " recalls Bruin , " and I sat there and smiled for two hours . " <p> His date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bob haircut and sailor suit dress to the Deluxe . As an accessory , she carries a Pez dispenser featuring Donald Duck in his own sailor suit . <p> " I really like swing music , and I always liked the ' 40s and ' 50s , " says Dexter , who went grunge long enough to come out of it with a nose ring . " I know I 'm in nineteen- ninety- . . . what year is it ? " <p> You 'd never guess inside the Deluxe , with Vise Grip holding forth in one of his 36 double-breasted suits and wearing black and white spectator shoes . <p> " Having a bar that 's like this and a band like this is a dream come true , " says Gentry Lane , 25 , who is in a cocktail halter dress and a crystal bracelet . <p> The retro scene has expanded down the Peninsula , where the Palace , a converted 1928 movie theater in Sunnyvale , throws a Thursday night supper club , and across the bay to the historic Claremont , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of room to dance . SINATRA TRIBUTE <p> One weekend in July the Ace Cafe on the SOMA strip had Indigo Swing followed by Bob Dalpe 's tribute to Frank Sinatra . <p> " It 's a very romantic period to be alive and performing , " says Indigo Swing singer John Boydston , 30 . " We just got caught up in the whole era . " <p> They will all be caught up at Bimbo 's this weekend . " Setzer 's doing the same thing he did for rockabilly in the early ' 80s , " says Lane . <p> " My wife 's bugging me to learn to swing dance , " Setzer says . " I 've got ta go and take lessons . I 'm kind of jealous of these kids who can really do it . " <p> Wait till he gets a load of Peanut in his spats . The last and only person allowed to wear spats in Bimbo 's was Cerchiai 's grandfather , Agostino " Bimbo " Giuntoli , who wore them as a trademark . <p> " Now these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Cerchiai . " He 's probably looking down and happy to see this action going on .
