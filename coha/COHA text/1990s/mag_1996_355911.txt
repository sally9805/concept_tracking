The grand pageant of American politics , the election of a new President , takes place once every four years and draws to it a vast national  --  even global  --  audience of observers , analysts and commentators who declaim its significance and decry its flaws . A simultaneous event , the election of the Congress of the United States , arguably the anchor of American democracy , is often treated as a sideshow . <P> Yet the makeup of the House of Representatives and the Senate is as important as who is elected President . The character of Congress depends entirely upon its collective political balance , which in turn depends on the mood and mind-set of nearly 100 million individual voters making choices in 435 districts . Because whom you elect to represent you ultimately does affect the conduct of your government , TIME  --  in collaboration with Congressional Quarterly  --  offers you this guide to the House and Senate candidates in your region . <P> If Bill Clinton is re-elected President but inherits a Congress similar to the existing one  --  controlled by Republicans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we are likely to experience a government much like the one that has operated in recent months . If Republicans manage to retain control of both houses and win the White House , Bob Dole could move quickly on a broadly conservative agenda that would include a balanced-budget plan and his across-the-board 15% income tax cut . <P> A Democrat-dominated government resulting from a Clinton win and a Congress led by Democrats  --  whether by retaking the House , or the Senate , or both  --  would allow House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt to pursue his Families First agenda , which calls for expanded health insurance for children , greater pension security and increased aid to education . Whether a re-elected Clinton would support those measures , however , is uncertain . Least likely is the combination of a Dole presidency and a Democrat-led Congress  --  an outcome that could render Dole 's entire agenda , from tax cuts to shrinking government , dead on arrival on Capitol Hill . <P> Elections are always entertaining . But the payoff is in the work of the government that elections create . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your part in building a government that works for all of us.
