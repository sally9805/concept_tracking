One hundred years have passed since the death of William Morris ( I834-I896 ) , and we have only just begun to heed his cries about the " ignoble ugliness " of our industrialized world . Morris 's crusade against the offensiveness of modern life was fueled by a fear that " civilization is on the road to trample out all the beauty of life and to make us less than men . " ' This concern led Morris to ponder the role of the craft arts , a subject he addressed in an ironically titled lecture , " The Lesser Arts , " in which he called for giving " people pleasure in the things they must perforce use . " 2 Though we now endure environmental offenses that Morris could never have imagined , our situation continues to be shaped by many of the forces that he opposed . Morris was one of the first to register the effects of mechanization and the numbing ubiquity of manufactured goods . Today , we also face an unprecedented challenge to the integrity of our experience from electronic media-television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution has even harsher consequences for material culture than did the industrial revolution , leaving in its wake dematerialized experience and disembodied relations . It is no longer a question , as it was in Morris 's day , of the quality of our physical environment , but whether we will continue to have contact with tangible reality at all . Against this backdrop of increasing dematerialization , the craft arts have a new and critical role to play . Now more than ever , we require objects that can serve as antidotes to the rising tide of mechanical relations , synthetic materials and virtual experience . As the social theorist Marshall McLuhan observed , " the implications of tactility could only have been lost to human awareness in a . . . culture which is now dissolving under the impact of electronic circuitry . " , It is precisely the implications of tactility for contemporary jewelry that I wish to explore , especially as they relate to the work of Alyssa Dee Krauss and Sandra Sherman . Whereas Morris was concerned primarily with offenses against our sense of sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected . Much has been written about the importance of touch for human development and selfawareness . In his groundbreaking study Touching : The Human Significance of the Skin , Ashley Montagu documents the physiological and psychological changes that touching , or its lack , can produce in humans.4 Distributed throughout our body , the tactile sense depends upon environmental stimuli in order to develop its receptivity . As Montagu claims , " stimulation of the skin by the external environment serves to maintain both sensory and motor tonus. " 5 Our tactile interactions , including our involvement with jewelry , can be rightfully assessed in terms of their contribution to our sensory and motor tonus .

In the field of contemporary art , the theorist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Regression to touch is perhaps the only way of waking the body to the fact that it is not a machine . . . it is the best means of feeling real and alive to counteract a sense of unreality and indifference . " 6 Kuspit goes on to suggest that the most socially useful task of art today is to represent touch convincingly , to create a " touching " space . This discussion of touch might seem a digression from the topic of contemporary jewelry . On the contrary , it could be argued that jewelry 's most significant function today is not visual or symbolic , but tactile . While jewelry is typically designed for visual appeal-to catch our eye-more importantly it can snag and engage our flesh , providing much needed stimulation to the skin . Far greater than a mere fashion accessory , jewelry can be a powerful instrument for heightened physical awareness . The stakes involved in such awareness are high , encompassing our entire experience of being in the world . According to Montagu , " Loss of touch with the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has substance and structure only insofar as it is based on the reality of bodily feeling . " 7 The importance of tactile stimulation for human wellbeing is borne out by the proliferation of worry beads , fingering-pieces and rosaries in various cultures . These manual stimulants testify to the basic need for concentrated touch as a means of appeasing the body . Montagu sees such objects functioning as self-comforting devices that use the skin to relieve physical stress.8 Though tactility is ultimately the most potent feature of these objects , this aspect has remained largely unacknowledged within the culture , as has the important tactile function of jewelry . Touch is the key component of jewelry 's power to serve as an agent of transformation and selfawareness . Like a benign gadfly , jewelry can stir our bodies into greater alertness . An extreme form of the desire to engage parts of our body is the current practice of body piercing . Often interpreted as an act of masochism or exhibitionism , body piercing can also be seen as a deliberate attempt to heighten the body 's sensitivity , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . Each jewelry format has a different range of impact for tht creator and the wearer . The preferred format for many of today 's most sophisticated jewelers is the brooch . Perhaps the " purest " and most self-contained form , it can be attached to the body 's surface like a small painting or sculpture and , typically , is independent of wearer interaction . Brooches are limited in their effect , however , because of their attachment to clothing and lack of direct contact with the wearer 's skin . Earrings , the least favored form of contemporary art jewelry , are also restricted in weight and scale to the load-bearing capacity of the ears , though they are ideal for artists experimenting with audio stimulation . As for tactile stimulation , rings are an especially potent format . Like bracelets and necklaces , they not only demand direct physical contact but also involve penetration . We thrust our arms and fingers into bracelets and rings , and encircle our necks with chokers and neckpieces . Rather than treating the body as a surface on which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater potential for drawing us into the haptic realm . Every jeweler must come to terms with the human body as a site and source of sensory experience . Accordingly , each demands a different degree of participation and physical awareness from the wearer . Some jewelers produce highly wearerfriendly work , requiring little conscious attention or active engagement . Others are more demanding , creating works that compromise body movement or stimulate the skin . Boris Bally , one of today 's most challenging jewelers , has produced works that inflict rather than relieve tension , as in his viselike Constrictor , I99o . The wearerresponsive jewelry of Rachelle Thiewes gently prods the wearer into alertness through tapered forms that fall against sensitive body parts . Like other kinetic jewelry , these works employ movement and friction as atten tion-getting devices , forcing the wearer to register the consequences of their actions . // CLOCKWISE FROM TOP LEFT : From Sandra Sherman 's Rings of Engagement series , 1996-Balance , 18k gold , water level , glass , 1 1/8 by 5/8 inches ; Direction , 1 Bk gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5/8 inches ; Time , 24k gold , sterling , hourglass , 1 1/4 by 1 inches . // CLOCKWISE FROM TOP LEFT : From Sandra Sherman 's Rings of Engagement series , 1996-Balance , 18k gold , water level , glass , 1 1/8 by 5/8 inches ; Direction , 18 k gold , silver , compass needle , glass , 1 1/4 by 5/8 inches ; Time , 24k gold , sterling , hourglass , 1 1/4 by 1 inches . // CLOCKWISE FROM TOP LEFT : From Sandra Sherman 's Rings of Engagement series , 1996-Balance , 18k gold , water level , glass , 1 1/8 by 5/8 inches ; Direction , 18 k gold , silver , compass needle , glass , 11/4 by 5/8 inches ; Time , 24k gold , sterling , hourglass , 1 1/4 by 1 inches . // Other jewelers reveal an interest in heightening our tactile sense through danger , like the Swiss artist Bernhard Schobinger , who incorporates glass shards in neckpieces that threaten to cut the flesh . A less dangerous example of this concept is Ted Muehling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete with a dangling drop of blood . Of the various contemporary American jewelers exploring the body as a sensory site , Sandra Sherman and Alyssa Dee Krauss are exceptional for their ability to make jewelry 's implicit tactile function explicit . Several of Krauss 's works concentrate on the interior as opposed to the exterior , as in Six Rings for Urban Dwellers , 1992 , which asks wearers to stick their fingers into fur , sea sponge and chewing gum . Made more to be felt than seen , they are intended for the skin 's delectation rather than the eye 's delight . Krauss revers es the usual priorities in jewelry , placing emphasis on the wearer 's intimate , even hidden , tactile experience above any visual effect or symbolic content . This shift from the behold er 's sight to the wearer 's touch is clearly demonstrated in Brooch for Holding Fur Next to Skin , I996 , which presents th viewer with a small silver strip , while the wearer secretly luxuriates in the sensation of mink . Yet another work that captures Krauss 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I992 . In this revealingly titled piece , a bark exterior surrounds a furry hole , offering a soft refuge for touch-deprived and weary hands . This bracelet also conveys a basic truth-that fur is one of the most irresistible materials known to humankind and nothing else so awakens our sense of touch . Krauss 's commitment to tactile arousal is further evident in Tickle Ring , I995 , a double loop of gold supporting a tufted grass straw , its sole purpose the titillation of the skin . Sherman has also created several works that inventively exploit jewelry 's haptic quality . Her earlier kinetic pieces , like Meander Bracelet , I989 , are dynamic structures that change shape and volume in response to movement , establishing a symbiotic bond between wearer and worn . In the 1996 Rings of Engagement series , Sherman plays on the tradition of engagement rings-both symbolically and formally-with works that literally engage the wearer 's body . Adapting the standard token of binding love , she places instruments for gauging motion and time-water levels , compasses , hourglasses-in traditional gem settings . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to monitor our lived bodily experience . To carry the metaphor of engagement even further , one can see these rings as " proposing " a carnal marriage , a lifelong physical relationship with ourselves . Sherman offers a more intimate aid for physical engagement in her pendant Cupid 's Folly , I993 . Designed to encircle the wearer 's waist with a dangling bauble at the end of a chain , this unisex love ornament can be hung inside or outside the wearer 's clothing to provide direct or mediated groin stimulation . Far from foolish , Cupids Folly knowingly abets the courtship and education of the body . We sorely need devices for corporeal stimulation in our increasingly dematerialized and touch-deprived culture . And McLuhan recognized the crucial role artists can play in providing correctives to technological change , writing , " The artist can correct the sense ratios before the blow of new technology has numbed conscious procedures . " 9 By providing a form of physical therapy and adjusting our sense ratios , jewelers like Sandra Sherman and Alyssa Dee Krauss can help rehabilitate us to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire category of objects continues to be downplayed at the very moment it could serve us in our time of bodily need . The crafts are among the most subversive objects in circulation today , feeding an underground movement of individuals who refuse to leave the senses behind . Morris expressed a similar belief in " The Lesser Arts " when he wrote , " It is one of the chief uses of decoration , the chief part of its alliance with nature , that it has to sharpen our dulled senses .... For this end are those wonders of intricate patterns interwoven , those strange forms invented , which men have so long delighted in . " ' As a type of decoration , albeit a highly complex one , jewelry can play a potent role in sharpening our dulled senses and assisting the body in its sensual vigil . Footnote 1 .
