<p> In the glow of a warming lamp , Illinois teenager Steven Stice would huddle near sheep as they struggled to give birth . Surrounded by wood and hay , he welcomed the wobbly lambs during crisp early spring nights . <p> More than two decades later , Stice , 37 , is still captivated by the miracle of it all . In January , the researcher eagerly awaited the birth of two Holstein calves , celebrating the event with bottles of champagne . <p> These calves , named Charlie and George , were special to Stice . They represented a scientific double punch that many thought could not be done : Not only were the calves clones , but they also were products of transgenics  --  the science of altering and adding genes . <p> Although others had accomplished each task separately , Stice and his partner , James Robl , were the first in the world to combine the techniques successfully , joining an elite international group of barnyard bioengineers . <p> Now Stice has agreed to leave his 8-acre Massachusetts farm for Athens , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animal bovine reproductive physiology at the University of Georgia . <p> " I 'm very excited about this opportunity , " said Stice , an adjunct professor at the University of Massachusetts and father of three . " Coming to Georgia should be a great move  --  for both my research and my family . " <p> His arrival also could make Georgia a leader in cloning animals for more efficient food production , local business leaders say . And Georgia also could step forward in the controversial area of " pharming "  --  turning genetically altered animals into walking drug factories , producing medicine through their milk and urine . <p> " This is very significant for our state , " said William J. Todd , president of the Georgia Research Alliance , a public-private partnership that paid for the UGA chair and works with universities to commercialize academic research . " He will make us a top-drawer player in this field ( of cloning ) . " <p> It was a major coup for the alliance , which has already lured 28 top scholars to the state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Hall , a scientist at the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture . " Everyone in Georgia should be very proud . He could have gone anywhere in the world , and you got him . " <p> For Stice , UGA offers a host of advantages . The university has a new $ 22 million animal science complex that includes state-of-the-art birthing pens , laboratories and a slaughterhouse . And because of the research alliance , the university can encourage its faculty to shop their ideas in the marketplace . <p> Stice is co-founder of Advanced Cell Technology Inc. , a livestock-cloning company in Worcester , Mass . Under the Georgia arrangement , he also will have an undisclosed stake in a new company called OptiGen Inc. , created to clone top-quality cattle and pigs for livestock farmers . From the city to the farm For Stice , the international renown is the culmination of dogged determination , persistent work and solid scientific theory . <p> Originally a city kid in Minneapolis , Stice discovered a new life in the eighth grade when his father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm in central Illinois . <p> Stice loved it , especially lambing season . " It was the most work , but it was also the most fun , " he said . Stice also met his wife of 15 years , Tracey , when he was in high school . As teens , they lived five miles apart and shared a passion for Irish setters . <p> When he went off to the University of Illinois , it was Tracey who took care of his livestock while he was away . " I must have been really in love , " she said , laughing . <p> All through college and graduate school , Stice 's interest remained focused on animal reproduction . And when he started studying cloning , he heard his calling . <p> " I could immediately see the economic and social benefits of ( animal ) cloning , " he said . " I was hooked . " <p> But Stice , described as brilliant by his colleagues , also was fascinated by " pharming "  --  an agricultural movement that began in the mid- ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , scientists believed they could create an array of vaccines , and they thought therapies could be created much more cheaply than by using traditional methods . <p> The potential was boundless . Researchers were experimenting with potatoes that made laboratory mice immune to cholera ; transplants of pig organs into humans ; getting sheep 's milk to produce a protein used to treat emphysema . <p> Transgenics and pharming also offered hope to people with illnesses so rare that pharmaceutical companies ignored their conditions because the price of research and development could not be covered through sales . <p> But researchers often found that transgenics in livestock was disappointing . Only about one in 100 animals acquired the altered gene , and of those , the gene actually worked as expected in half the cases . <p> The reason : Nature either ignores the altered gene or sees it as damaged and repairs it . <p> Stice wondered what would happen if a researcher performed transgenics and then cloned the livestock . That way , any altered gene would transfer to the offspring . The concept is similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They might start with basic patterns , then customize the dresses to their own tastes before sending them off to a factory for mass production . <p> In 1994 , Stice and Robl launched Advanced Cell Technology . They planned to create a herd of cloned cattle genetically altered to produce the human serum albumin , a blood protein that regulates the transfer of fluid in the body . It is critical to people suffering from liver disease , severe burns and malnutrition . <p> Hospitals currently rely on donated blood for almost 500 tons of albumin needed each year nationwide . If cattle could produce it , one cow could produce up to 176 pounds a year . <p> But like scores of scientists before him , Stice found that regulatory concerns halted much of the progress . He was also up against larger , better-funded pharmaceutical companies . <p> And there are still problems with cloning . Stice created his genetically altered , cloned calves by using fetal cells , which he says are more malleable than the mammary cells used to create Dolly , the famous cloned sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  a genetic marker . <p> Then the nucleus from a host egg was stripped out and replaced with the nucleus of the genetically altered fetal cell . The egg was incubated and placed in the uterus of a surrogate mother . The resulting offspring was found to carry only the genes of the altered fetal cell . <p> Overnight , the accomplishment made Stice a superstar among the world 's top cloning scientists . And as word of the experiment hit the press , Stice and his modest Midwestern charm suddenly became a hot commodity in both the academic and business arenas . <p> " When they were born , I was so thrilled , " Stice said . " But I was probably even more excited when the ( DNA ) tests came back five days later because that showed what we had done actually worked  --  that it really worked . " <p> But , like Dr. Ian Wilmut , the Scottish researcher who engineered Dolly , Stice found that getting a live clone is still difficult . Wilmut used more than 250 embryos to get Dolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 cloned embryos dying . And of those implanted , only 20 percent survive . Techniques have critics In Georgia , Stice 's work should be less stressful . <p> Although he is committed to continue his research in pharming , his first priority in the state will simply be to clone better , hardier livestock for farmers . <p> That goal , however , angers critics , especially since cloning is expensive and has a relatively low success rate . <p> Resources that could go toward less invasive , low-tech agricultural techniques are instead being spent on questionable practices like cloning and transgenics , opponents say . <p> " This program is being pitched as a way to raise animals cheaply and efficiently , but to raise livestock to feed people is about the most inefficient thing you can do , " said Lewis Regenstein , a Georgia author and environmental activist . " This really grates on me . We 're going the wrong way on this . " <p> Instead , grains should go directly to feed people , Regenstein said . One ton of high-protein grain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will yield about 125 pounds of meat . But the same amount of grain could supply the needs of five people for a year , he said . <p> Others worry that the Brave New World ushered in by scientists will be the downfall of thousands of farmers and perhaps others who can not anticipate how adding or altering genes will play out . <p> A key concern is that cloning would create herds or flocks that have a genetic uniformity , which is " completely contrary to nature 's wisdom and good farming practices , " said Dr. Michael W. Fox , an ethicist with the national Humane Society . <p> The reason : Farmers are creating a " monoculture " that increases a herd 's or flock 's susceptibility to disease . <p> " It 's not just the genes that make animals productive and healthy , " said Fox , author of the forthcoming book , " The Genetic Sorcerers . " " It 's good nutrition , good husbandry practices , and it 's also the development of animals that are genetically adapted to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> In contrast , Fox said , multinational corporations are trying to pawn off cloned animals as the solution to disease when , in fact , transgenic products have had mixed results . Although animals and plants might have better resistance in the lab , it often is unknown how they will fare in the real world . <p> Critics will also be watching Stice 's progress with pharming , which they say is riddled with potential problems . <p> Purity and consistency of the medicine could be an issue , especially until there are regulations on isolating such livestock from other cattle or sheep . And there are unforeseen dangers , such as an animal virus or protein that , once loose in humans , could create a new wave of powerful diseases . <p> Stice says the dangers are overstated . <p> " There are some legitimate concerns , " he said . " But there will always be room for traditional breeding . . . and any responsible scientist is going to be extremely careful not to clone too much . " <p> He also draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's terribly unethical , " he said . " And to be honest , I ca n't think of one good reason to do it . " <p> Stice is also unsure about the cloning of pets , but more on the basis of science than ethics . Each month , he gets a handful of letters pleading that he clone a beloved dog or cat . <p> The researcher says the animals  --  unlike cattle , pigs or sheep  --  are n't as understood physiologically , and therefore any cloning attempts are less predictable . <p> But Stice predicts that pets could be cloned within five years . Cats are likely to be the first choice . <p> " They 're simpler than dogs , " he said . Business climate cited Stice is expected to lay down roots in Georgia 's red clay in less than two weeks , a result of years of networking and a powerful recruitment effort . <p> Clifton Baile , an eminent scholar in agricultural biotechnology at UGA , spearheaded the push . Baile first met Stice in 1992 , while Baile worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very early stages of cloning and embryo transfers , and the two were trying to figure out how to collaborate . The effort failed . <p> Baile met Stice again in 1995 , while Baile was trying to persuade Avian Farms , the parent company of Stice 's Advanced Cell Technology , to move many of its operations to Georgia . That also failed . <p> But the third time , Baile was able to lure Stice back on the promise of a new center and a philosophy of cooperation between academics and industry . <p> At the time , Stice 's relationship with the University of Massachusetts was less than ideal  --  at least financially . <p> Stice and Robl had come under fire for a contract with the university that would give the school royalties of 0.25 percent of the proceeds made by Advanced Cell Technology  --  far below the level of standard royalty contracts . <p> " The university was giving away the technology , " Joseph F.X . McGuirl , the school 's commercial ventures director , said in an April interview . <p> A new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royalties of 4.5 percent of Advanced Cell Technology 's net sales of biotech and therapeutic products . <p> But the wrangling left a bitter taste , and Stice said he found a better business climate in Georgia . <p> " I think there 's a mind-set , lacking elsewhere , that academics and industry can work well together , " Stice said . " That was something the University of Massachusetts was never really interested in doing , and we had to pull them along every step of the way . " <p> In addition to the $ 1.5 million chair  --  to pay for lab assistants and equipment  --  Stice will make an annual salary of $ 140,000 , according to UGA spokesman Tom Jackson . Of that , half is being paid by the university and half by business owners associated with Stice 's new company , OptiGen . <p> The private start-up company is separate from the university , and neither Stice nor other partners would discuss details of his contract , fostered by the Georgia Research Alliance . <p> " It was done on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a challenge , however , to make these arrangements in high-tech growth areas ; things can change so fast . " <p> Stice said he 's looking forward to his new life in Georgia , hoping to find a small town where he can raise his children and run a " gentleman 's farm . " <p> " I 'm thrilled to be coming , " he said . " We 're going to do great things .
