Looking back , trying to pinpoint the moment in 1990 when she first knew something was wrong , Julia Uihlein recalls a September afternoon , a soccer game and the ashen face of Alex , her 11-year-old son . Alex was not injured , but he had suddenly become so pale and ill looking that his coach pulled him out of the game . What had at first seemed to be the flu soon took a frightening turn . Constant , burning pain in his legs kept Alex awake at night . The slightest touch , even by a bedsheet , hurt unbearably . He began to have trouble walking . <P> The doctors were stumped . " My worst fear was that it was a tumor on his spinal cord , " his mother says . The Uihleins ( pronounced E-lines ) , who live in Milwaukee , Wis. , took Alex to several respected medical centers in the Midwest , but none had an answer . One doctor even accused Alex of faking . " He said , ' You deserve an Academy Award , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even Julia began to doubt her son . Then , she remembers , " I said , ' Let 's get out of here . ' " <P> By November , Alex needed a wheelchair . Julia kept calling doctors . Finally , a neurologist suggested that Alex might have an unusual nerve disorder known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy . He urged Julia and her husband David to take their son to Children 's Hospital in Boston to see a doctor named Charles Berde . <P> A pediatrician and anesthesiologist , and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School , Berde , 46 , is co-founder and director of the pain-treatment service at Children 's Hospital . That service , established in 1986 , was among the first in the U.S. to specialize in children 's pain . Fewer than a dozen American hospitals provide such departments for children . <P> The staff includes doctors , nurses , psychologists , physical therapists and an acupuncturist . They treat children in the hospital and in an outpatient clinic for both acute and chronic pain  --  due to surgery , injuries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migraine headaches , hemophilia and nerve disorders . The team is nationally recognized for its expertise in treating the reflex sympathetic dystrophy that Alex Uihlein 's doctor suspected . Berde is also a leading researcher in pediatric anesthesiology , and he has written more than 70 scientific papers and 50 book chapters dealing with ways to improve the prevention and treatment of pain in children . No child in his care is ever accused of faking . " They 're not crazy , they 're not faking , they 're not making it up , they 're not lying , " he says . " Pain is real . " <P> Berde likes and respects children , and he has known he wanted to work with kids and families ever since his medical-school days at Stanford , where he also earned a Ph.D . in biophysics . He is calm , soft-spoken , easy to talk to and genuine : not given to calling his young patients " Pal " or " Dude " or demanding high-fives . Pictures of his two children abound in his cluttered office . His beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tall enough to tower over his patients .
