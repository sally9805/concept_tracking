<p> Here 's good news for the military . It is called " Surviving Media " and is the latest book by Dr. Harold J. Liverworth , world 's foremost authority . <p> At present I can say little , for it is not yet in bookshops , and may never be if the Pentagon , where it is now being studied at the highest levels , decides to classify it secret . This would not be surprising . Why let Saddam Hussein stroll into a bookstore and for a mere $24.95 buy access to the Pentagon 's secrets for defeating the media ? <p> I can , however , reveal that the jacket illustration on Dr. Liverworth 's book is a reproduction of Frederic Remington 's famous painting " Holding the Pack at Bay . " This shows Gen. George Custer 's official spokesperson standing undaunted before hundreds of angry media representatives just after he has refused to provide horses to get them to the Little Big Horn before the battle ends . <p> As this suggests , and as Dr. Liverworth writes in the dust-jacket copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide for military brass , briefers and flacks who hope to escape media encounters intact . " <p> The jacket 's blurbs , which Dr. Liverworth also wrote , as he does for all his books , promise an unforgettable reading experience . " Profoundly liberating , " says one . Another : " powerful and evocative . . . a masterly depiction . " And another : " Rich in the foibles and triumphs of the human spirit . " <p> Faithful Liverworth fans may notice these are the same blurbs that appeared on the jackets of his last two best sellers , " The Coming Breakthrough in Chintz " and " How to Travel With a Cat . " <p> When I chided him about blurb policy , he observed that no one could be better qualified than the world 's foremost authority to blurb a book . And since he had already written a perfect set of blurbs for one book , would it not be foolish to write fresh ones for ensuing books ? Was it not impossible to improve on perfection ? <p> I slyly suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked time to write new ones , what with keeping up his nationally syndicated medical column ( " Aches and Pains " ) , maintaining his prize-winning television show ( " Ask Dr. Liverworth " ) and writing three best-selling books per year . <p> " As a foremost authority on diction , " he replied , " I wish you had not slyly suggested the content of that graceless sentence . Saying ' slyly suggested ' gives your sentence a sophomoric quality . The trouble results from your lazy choice of the weak verb ' suggested . ' Because it is weak , it tempts you to use the strengthening adverb ' slyly . ' Instead of saying you ' slyly suggested , ' you should have chosen a forceful verb embodying a sense of slyness . Thus you would have eliminated the need for an adverb . In short , you should have said ' I insinuated . ' " <p> Having to listen to such lectures is one burden of interviewing the doctor . Afterward , though , he always apologizes , explaining that the incessant toil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so drained of froth that he falls inexorably into fussiness . <p> I accepted his apology , hoping that geniality might loosen his tongue about some of the juicier passages in " Surviving Media . " I 'd heard talk in the publishing world about a devastating new policy called " Co-opt , Do n't Confront , " which Dr. Liverworth was proposing for getting war reporters happily sedated . <p> Surprisingly , he was happy to leak about this . The Pentagon had urged him to leak , since it was often only by leaking that you could get Washington to act . <p> His plan , he said , was to give media people uniforms . Get them feeling more military . Make them officers . Ex officio , of course . Would n't want them to feel shanghaied . Plenty of brass and braid , though . Nobody lower than colonel . For television anchors , plenty of stars : admirals , generals , maybe even lots of chest ribbons for successful ratings . <p> Pretty soon they 'd feel like big-time insiders . Might clam up tighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press , I was insulted at Dr. Liverworth 's proposal . " So you think we can be so easily co-opted , eh , Mr. Foremost Authority ? " I cried . <p> " I merely propose , " he said , " that admirals and generals do to military reporters what Presidents , Congressmen , bureaucrats , lawyers and miscellaneous politicians have done for years to the rest of the Washington press with remarkable success . The trick the Pentagon must learn has been known forever by everybody else in government : Co-opt , do n't confront . "
