The first half of 1994 was a doozie  --  and not just for shareholders , who lost an average of 5.8% in domestic-stock funds , 3.7% in taxable bond funds and 4.3% in tax-frees . The remarkably unblemished image of the $2 trillion fund industry took some nicks as well : * In January , $9.4 billion Invesco fired star manager John Kaweske , saying he failed to follow company rules on trading in personal accounts . * In March and April , investors suffered losses of as much as 19% in supposedly safe , short-term bond funds that had been using risky derivatives to boost yields . * In March the Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC is investigating whether $10 billion Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management , sponsor of 24 mutual funds , shifted poor-performing junk bonds from institutional accounts to some of its retail funds , including Strong Total Return . A company spokesman denies that any trades were made to favor one account over another but says the firm is negotiating a settlement with the SEC . Such a deal could involve restitution to fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion Fidelity Investments knowingly gave newspapers incorrect , day-old closing prices for 162 funds after an in-house computer bombed . So what gives ? Chalk up most of the investment losses to rising interest rates that zapped bond prices and shook stocks . And then came the falling dollar , which dropped below the 100-yen level in June , raising the prospect that the Fed would have to hike rates further to defend the currency . For stock funds , the half was the worst since an average 9.2% loss in the Saddam-spooked last half of 1990 . Overseas funds suffered least , down 2% ; aggressive growth funds toppled most , losing 8.1% . All six of our fixed-income categories lost money in the six months through June , with high-yield corporate bond funds dropping the least ( 2.2% on average ) and U.S. Government funds the most ( 4.4% ) . Of course , some individual funds did manage to buck the trend . The aggressive growth fund Dreyfus Strategic Growth ( $71 million in assets ) was the best-performing diversified U.S. stock fund , up 9.1% ; $588 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can find results for your funds  --  or any that interest you  --  in MONEY 's biggest midyear report ever . Beginning on page 54 , we give you the W top-performing individual funds in six major categories . Then come midyear results for 3,045 funds that have been in operation for more than a year , broken into two tiers : major and extra . The major category includes 1,967 funds that are open to all retail investors and in most states for initial investments of $25,000 or less . The 1,078 extra funds group includes single-state muni bond funds and those that are open only to affinity groups , as well as secondary classes of shares of major funds . The natural question now : What 's next  --  and what of those chinks in the fund industry 's facade ? As MONEY 's chief investment strategist Michael Sivy has been saying , share prices could wobble for the rest of the year , with the Dow dipping to around 3200 . But barring an unexpected spurt in inflation to above 5% ( it was at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass 4000 on the Dow next year and 5000 before the decade 's end . As for bonds , forget the double-digit total returns that prevailed for much of the past dozen years as interest rates fell ; get ready instead for returns of 5% to 9% , depending on the type of issues your fund holds . Best advice : Maintain your investment plan , and keep putting money into funds  --  specially equity funds  --  at regular intervals , because mutual funds still outshine most alternatives for long-term savers . As for the industry 's integrity , keep 1994 's events in perspective . For instance , Fidelity 's pricing snafu was serious , as the company conceded in promising never to do it again . At the same time , no shareholders lost money , says the firm , since correct prices were used for all transactions that day . Says Avi Nachmany , executive vice president of the fund consulting firm Strategic Insight : " In a $2 trillion industry , it seems remarkable that problems have been so few . " True enough . But problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as little more risky than money funds  --  are deeply troubling nonetheless . ( For more on derivatives , see page 26 . ) The message for investors : Have faith in what is essentially a highly responsible industry , but maintain your inquisitiveness and skepticism as you search for the right funds . HOW TO READ OUR TABLES TYPE We divide our 3,045 funds into 14 types , based on each fund 's investment objective and the kinds of securities it buys . For example , growth and income ( abbreviated G &I; a key to the abbreviations appears below ) describes funds that buy stocks with rapidly increasing earnings as well as dividend-paying stocks and bonds . We use eight categories for equity funds , six for fixed-income funds . In the tables , stock and bond funds are listed separately , in alphabetical order . STYLE This column gives two insights . For stock funds , it tells you the median market value ( large , medium or small ) of the stocks that the fund owns and whether the manager favors growth stocks with accelerating earnings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed-income funds , it indicates whether the average weighted maturity of bonds in the portfolio is short , intermediate or long and whether their credit quality is high , medium or low . RISK LEVEL Our risk measure is based on the number of months a fund has underperformed risk-free Treasury bills during the past three years and the magnitude of that underperformance . We rank all major funds with three-year records against one another ( regardless of type ) and divide them into 12 equal groups . A fund 's risk rating indicates the group into which it falls , from 1 ( least risky ) through 12 ( riskiest ) . PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS Here we rank the fund 's total return against all funds of the same type on a scale of 0 ( lowest ) to 99 ( highest ) . A score of 89 , for instance , means that a fund beat 89% of its competitors that year . Funds that consistently score above 50 ( the median ) are likely to provide a higher return in the long run than funds that rise to 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANNUAL CHARGES This figure reflects the fund 's total operating expenses  --  including administrative costs , investment management fees and any marketing charges  --  expressed as a percentage of assets . These expenses come straight out of shareholders ' pockets , so lean toward funds with below-average expenses : less than 0.83% for bond funds and below 1.38% for stock funds . FIVE-YEAR TOTAL COST PER $1,000 This figure , which the Securities and Exchange Commission requires the funds to calculate , shows you the total amount you would pay in expenses  --  including all annual fees and sales loads  --  if you invested $1,000 in a fund that earned 5% annually and redeemed your shares at the end of five years . Because it includes all charges , this figure is the fairest way to compare the expenses of funds with different cost structures  --  load vs. no-load , front-end vs. back-end load and so on .
