<p> Ken Showman breezed through four interviews here at software giant Microsoft one day last month . But halfway through the fifth , he felt his tie tighten like a noose around his neck . <p> A software-coding problem had him stumped . He was tired , confused . There were two more interviews to go . And his inquisitor , David McKinnis , was waiting for an answer . " I felt like I blew it , " says Showman , 21 , a senior at the University of California at Berkeley majoring in computer science . " There were a lot of hard questions . There was no oxygen ( Agetting to my head . " To Showman 's surprise , he got a job offer anyway . And Microsoft - the phenomenally successful software company founded by Harvard dropout Bill Gates - proved once again that its college-recruiting system is among the most rigorous in the nation . <p> As 1 million college seniors across the USA go through another spring of resume writing and interviewing , most companies continue to cut back on college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as computer science and engineering - find themselves being courted by four or five employers at once . At schools known for spewing out computer geniuses , Microsoft is among the most popular employers . It culls candidates by holding half-hour interviews on campus and sifting through 120,000 resumes a year . But only a third of the 450 students flown to Redmond for day-long interviews get offers . " We only hire very , very smart people , " says Jodi DeLeon , manager of college recruiting . " You really have to be a superstar . " Microsoft will hire 150 college graduates this year , up from 140 last year and well below total annual hiring of 2,000 to 2,500 . The remaining hires are experienced people plucked from other companies and 300 or so former summer interns . <p> Microsoft considers raw talent so crucial to its success that it devotes 22 staffers to college recruiting . IBM , which hired 1,100 college graduates last year and will do only limited hiring this year , employs 11 recruiters . Hewlett-Packard , which will hire 300 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven . <p> How do Microsoft interviewers know brilliance when they see it ? They ask difficult - sometimes bizarre - questions . Microsoft is notorious for throwing brain teasers at job candidates to see how quickly they think . Among them : " Why are manhole covers round ? " <p> Ed Fries , a group-development manager and veteran interviewer who supervises 70 programmers , prefers testing programming skills to posing brain teasers . He asks candidates to solve programming problems on the spot . Seems logical , but when he was looking for a job out of college seven years ago , many companies did n't bother to test his skills . <p> Microsoft claims not to care much about grades or experience . " It 's easy to get caught up @x experience , " says Karen Fries , Ed Fries ' twin and a former Microsoft recruiter who is now a program manager . " The hardest thing is to focus on the right stuff . Are they bright , driven , motivated ? It 's that diamond in the rough that makes Microsoft successful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layman 's terms to see whether they can communicate with customers . " I might say , ' Describe calculus as if I 'm your grandmother . ' " <p> Job candidates at Microsoft 's 250-acre campus outside Seattle typically see six or seven people in one-hour interviews through the day . After each session , comments are sent via electronic mail to the next interviewer . In most cases , the last interviewer of the day decides on the spot whether to make an offer . <p> But Microsoft 's job is n't over yet . Most people it wants have other offers . To convince them that it is the best , Microsoft stresses its reputation for being a stable company on the cutting edge and for being a fun place to work . The average age at the 18-year-old company is 31 . Some of the antics that go on here suggest the mind-set is even younger . For instance , managers will agree to jump fully clothed into Lake Bill , a manmade lake on campus , if workers promise to complete a project in an unusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T-shirts and a basketball hoop at the end of every hall - plus lunch-time jugglers , intramural sports teams , bungee-jumping clubs , indoor miniature golf and Foosball breaks contribute to a frat-party atmosphere that appeals to many just emerging from a college campus . At colleges , Microsoft representatives show an MTV-inspired video complete with happy workers water-skiing on Lake Washington , hanging out in Seattle cafes and saying things like , " The people you work with are amazing . You get spoiled . You start thinking everybody in the world is smart . " <p> The point is made loud and clear : You play hard , you work hard . Too hard , some say . In his book Accidental Empires , Robert Cringely , a columnist for the trade publication Info World , likens Microsoft to " any successful cult " using " sacrifice and penance and the idea that the deity is perfect . . . . Each level , from Gates on down , screams at the next , goading and humiliating them . And while you can work any 80 hours per week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ca n't talk back in a meeting when your boss says you are s - - - in front of all your co-workers . " <p> Cringely says Microsoft encourages employees to work late by keeping cafeterias open 24 hours , offering cheap food and free drinks . After his book was published last year , wives of Microsoft employees wrote to thank him , he says , saying they wish they 'd read it before their husbands accepted their jobs . <p> Ron Bailey , 29 , a senior from Montana State University , interviewed at Microsoft in March . " I heard it 's a sweatshop , " says Bailey , who is sole support of his wife and three children . " I do n't want to live here , I want to work here . " Ken Showman 's father , a software developer at Hewlett-Packard , also warned his son about the long hours . <p> But Microsoft recruiters say conditions have changed as many workers have gotten older , married and had families . Even Gates is engaged . Bailey talked to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slack times . He has since accepted a job as a software tester . <p> Microsoft 's famously lucrative stock options also make long hours easier to take . Though its starting salaries are generally considered on the low side of the industry , the difference is made up in options . With options , you get the right to buy Microsoft stock at a set price but you do n't pay for the stock unless you exercise the options . The price and number of shares are set upfront . You can sell 25% of your stock after 18 months , then one-eighth every six months thereafter . Virtually all software developers get options when hired , but not all workers do . About 75% of employees are eligible for options each year based on performance reviews . <p> According to one study , about 2,200 of the 5,635 employees at Microsoft before January 1990 have become millionaires - on paper , at least . The stock has risen from $ 2.33 at its 1986 initial public offering ( adjusted for splits ) to $ 90 1/4 Wednesday . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewed . He then flew to Austin , Texas , to talk to IBM . He also had a standing offer from a small company in Cupertino , Calif. - EnaTec Software Systems - where he 'd had a summer job . IBM expressed interest in him but dragged its feet . And Showman was n't thrilled about going back to Cupertino . So Friday , he accepted a job as a software developer at Microsoft . Says Showman : " This is the coolest thing that 's ever happened . " <p> Are you smart enough for Microsoft ? Here are some typical questions posed to job candidates at Microsoft . Interviewers are n't necessarily looking for a correct answer ; they want to see how a candidate thinks . <p> QUESTIONS 1 . You have a glass of orange juice and a glass of water with an equal amount of liquid in each . You take a spoonful of orange juice and mix it into the water . Then you take a spoonful of the mixture and put it into the orange juice . Is there more orange juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 2 . Why are manhole covers round ? 3 . You have a rectangular birthday cake . Someone has taken a rectangular piece out of the corner of the cake , which leaves you with an L-shaped piece of cake . With a single , straight knife stroke , how do you cut the L-shaped cake into two equal pieces . <p> ANSWERS , according to Microsoft 1 . Neither . Because each glass contains the same volume of liquid , there ca n't be more orange juice in the water or more water in the orange juice . Otherwise , one glass would hold more liquid than the other . 2 . If they were square , they could fall down the hole . 3 . A diagonal line through the center of a rectangle divides it in half . To divide the cake equally , cut along a line drawn through the center of the missing rectangle and the center of the entire cake . That way , you 've cut the whole cake in half and you 've cut the missing piece in half .
