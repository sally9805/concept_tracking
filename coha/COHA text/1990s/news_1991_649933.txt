<p> This is the story of three kids who grew up and enlisted in the Army . <p> They are the sons of Ben Lozano , who manages a liquor store and lives in Mendota , Calif . Their names are Rene , Benny Jr . and Robert , and all three of them are in the Persian Gulf . It 's an old , familiar story ; Rene was n't going anywhere much in college and so he joined the Army . The two younger boys followed . " They saw how well their brother was finding some direction in his life , " the father says of his three children , who are 24 , 20 and 19 . <p> But when one by one their units were activated , Mr. Lozano slowly realized that if war in the Persian Gulf came his family could be wiped out . In November he began to write letters to public officials asking if they could reassign just one of his sons , just one child to hold onto in case the worst happened , to be a comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him for a fact that there was a law against all the children in one family facing combat , and eventually he was able to attach a name to that law . The name was Sullivan : for five brothers who served on the same cruiser during World War II and who died together when the cruiser sank in the Pacific . <p> But the law everyone seemed to think existed was n't a law at all . There was a section of the Selective Service Act about sole surviving sons , and a Defense Department policy not to assign immediate family members to the same unit or ship . Neither covered the Lozano boys . The New Year came and all three were still in the gulf . The parents went on every television show that asked , talked to anybody with a notebook and a question . Rene called home . By chance he had spent Christmas day with Robert , and three weeks later ran into Benny . <p> " I 'm very proud of my kids for serving their country , but I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " their father says . " Not all three of them . " <p> War has a human face . This is a good thing . It is a good thing to write a story about people as well as programs and policies because it makes us understand . At the end of " Casablanca " Rick says it 's easy to see that the problems of a couple of little people do n't amount to a hill of beans in times of crisis , but the fact is that we 'd never watch the movie if they did n't . All of this war will be one little person after another . " Are there kids in Iraq ? " a kid asked me , getting to the heart of the matter . <p> For its first week this war was all about hardware , the planes and the Patriots . Now the software has begun to appear . The before and after faces of the Navy 's Lieut . Jeffrey Zaun , the photograph in dress uniform with his onyx-bright eyes , the videotape in captivity with his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeless as his voice . A woman on a stretcher in Tel Aviv , gaudy with blood , her lips parted . Another woman , older , with a scarf knotted beneath her chin , standing by the grave of her husband as the earth is thrown atop his coffin . <p> But regulations rarely have a human face , as any welfare recipient or immigration supplicant can tell you . Grandparents newly introduced to disposable diapers , Ninja Turtles and small children plagued by inchoate fears have wondered why both father and mother need to be sent to the war zone , why it is not possible to make some exceptions based on simple human considerations in what has been billed as a kindler , gentler nation . <p> The answer , and the answer to Ben Lozano 's questions , is contained in a Defense Department document just drafted in response to the indefatigable campaign of Ben and Dolly Lozano . " Expecting the same sacrifices of all military members with similar skills builds morale and enhances readiness , " it says . But there is hope contained within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its members dies , becomes 100 percent disabled , or is in a captured or missing in action status as a result of duty in the armed services in a combat zone , the remaining members are exempt , if they request , from serving in a combat zone . " <p> If one of Mr. Lozano 's sons dies , the other two can request reassignment . <p> " One could be dead and the other two never know it , and I could lose all three before they apply for a transfer , " the father says . Then , perhaps , there would be something known as the Lozano law . <p> War has a human face . This is one of them . Ben Lozano sees faces in his dreams , the faces of the three soldiers who he fears will show up on his doorstep one day to tell him and his wife that they are childless .
