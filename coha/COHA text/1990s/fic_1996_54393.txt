Bob gets much of his inspiration from his Hawaiian home . He says that the idea for " Camping in the Biosphere " came from " the swarm-like rise in rescue helicopter traffic which followed the opening of a new trail through Maunawili Valley , where I live here on Windward Oahu . " <p> The trailhead was situated at the end of the parking lot of the National EcoParks Lodge on Kauai , at the summit of Kokee . Beyond its green steel gate lay a switchback descent into the last undeveloped Hawaiian wilderness . The valley at its heart , Kalalau , spread northeast between two ridges which splayed wide and peaked like bent knees before the ridgelines descended steeply to the Pacific . Within the valley 's curtain walls the landscape undulated broad and green with tropical softwoods and hardwoods and palms ; the air was rich with the odor of white ginger . <p> Among the dozens of other hikers bright with outdoor gear , Max Dugan , Ph.D : , stood with Ghfa Candiotti ; B.A. , pending , in the staging area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirming in new hiking boots , the way he remembered they 'd squirmed in new Nike pumps the night he 'd lost his virginity with Sharon Stussy thirty years before , a week after O.J. 's low speed chase . <p> His heart was full . Sometimes , he told himself , life gives you these moments : you win a prize unexpectedly , a painful struggle transforms itself unaccountably into a triumph , a fantasy comes true . <p> Just months ago , Ghia had been an attractive but decidedly off-limits student in his course English 461 : Wordsworth Hypertext and Nature . Today he stood with her looking out over Kalalau , marveling at shades of green more vivid than the holos in the EcoPark brochures , watching her tongue and lips struggle  --  with an erotic poignancy , he thought  --  around the Hawaiian plant names shimmering at the border of the holding area on tiny holoplaques . <p> Ghia 's number had come up in the Interior Department 's lottery , giving her the right to camp for a week in one of the last wilderness areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on the trip , to sleep with her in her tent . <p> When she 'd first extended her invitation , Max had misheard : " Who 's bent ? " he 'd asked , lost in M.A. exams he was grading . <p> " Tent , " she 'd replied . " I 'm inviting you to sleep in my tent . " <p> He 'd taken a deep breath . Ghia was very smart , just a bit plump , sweet as a ripe peach  --  he 'd sleep with her in an overloaded laundry basket if she asked . But for starters there was Acura , his fiancee , as aware as he was of the faculty/student code engraved over the gates since the turn of the Twenty-first Century : Am as cognis non corpus ( emphasis on non ) . He was n't sure , but he guessed that if the university got wind of the trip , he could be fired before the sun went down on Bloomington , maybe even jailed  --  then conceivably visited in his cell by Acura with a DNA-altering cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghia with a dreamy resigned smile , thinking of Coleridge and Sara Hutchinson , of Shelley running off with fourteen-year-old girls , of Dylan Thomas and Vassar coeds , the diseased pleasures of earlier centuries . <p> " See , when I won the permit , I realized that all the ideas I have about Nature came from your class , " Ghia 'd told him . " Oh , I 've done all the virtual games , even camped with Girl Scouts over in the Hoosier Dome But I 've never even been to Six Flags Over Yellowstone , much less on an ecotour . All those ideas from your class I ca n't really understand just by myself . You know , like Nature as ' the guide , the guardian of your heart ? ' ' Tintern Abbey , ' right ? Professor Dugan . . . ? " The Midwestern afternoon light , yellowish-gray this high in the Humanities Highrise , gave a weird cast to the holopix of Kalalau she 'd brought along ( ' no greater destination in all of ecotourism ' ) . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The semester 's over now . It 'll make it easier for me to fantasize . " <p> " Max . So now I have a chance to get the experience behind the ideas , to understand them really . I need you there to help . " <p> " You 're aware I have a fiancee who teaches in the Law School ? " <p> " Perfect . She 'll understand absolutely , " Ghia 'd said . " I mean your being with me is actually a requirement now . See , if I ca n't make a practical connection between the ideas from your class and my real experience , there 's no authenticity , no fulfillment . I do n't wind up with a legitimate education . " Her innocent face was crossed by a dark look . " Your fiancee 'll be aware that it 's my legal right to require interpretive completion of my coursework . From you . If you look in the student/faculty conduct code ? Section four , paragraph six ? The one they added last year ? " <p> " Gim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghia wandered along his collection of antique Twentieth Century books shoved among the storage cubes in the adjoining media room , Max punched up Acura 's home number on the keyboard of his desk terminal  --  she 'd be starting dinner  --  toggled video on . <p> " Well , " Acura conceded from her kitchen , whacking a turkey sausage on the cutting board with unusual vigor , " your ex-student happens to be right . You have a pedagogical responsibility ; the Dean can fire you if you do n't go with her . That 's now the law . " <p> Max tried to look piously dismayed . Acura waved the knife around , splatting turkey product on the kitchen wall , on her suit , on the blue tie he 'd bought her for Law Day . When the screen went blank he remembered the times he 'd smiled at Ghia in class , a distant longing in his heart  --  well , maybe not his heart . Had he brought this on himself ? Was life wonderful or what ? <p> " ' Nature never did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled when she returned . <p> " ' Tintern Abbey ' again . " She grinned . " William to Doroths . This is going to be fun . " <p> So precisely at ten that late summer morning the Interactive Ranger Terminal inspected Ghia 's permit , certified their Emergency Position Locating Devices , scanned and approved their shoes , then propelled them through the gate . Max stepped behind her down the trail  --  the IR Terminal 's last audio was a warning that it was paved only for the first kilometer . On the upslope a wall of pink heliconia defined the route m a disciplined rank of plants so healthy they looked artificial . Downslope beyond a rock wall the pall fell away dramatically over a paradise of flowering trees and vines and half-hidden waterfalls . They seemed to be floating in mid-air in a dream of Eden . <p> Though Max was having second thoughts . He had n't actually seen Ghia again until they 'd met at the big Lihue jetport after separate flights from the mainland . It had been one thing to bathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like his ) as they 'd watched him pair up with an attractive young woman , quite another to assume she 'd really brought him here to snuggle in her tent and do the nasty . <p> Yet had n't she called two weeks before to remind him about his flight time wearing only a fetching mini-jumpsuit ? Had n't she spent longer than necessary brushing his clothes for possible alien seeds as they 'd waited at the trailhead ? Had n't she even seed-combed his hair , stroking slowly , twirling strands around her fingers ? They 'd groom ed each other , now that he thought about it , like animals about to mate . Had n't they ? " Ghia , " Max began , shifting the sixty pound pack on his back , " I think we need to get something straight . " <p> She turned to him clear-eyed and smiling uncertainly at the hitch in his voice . <p> He lost it again , and blushed , unable to be direct ; he 'd been born in the wrong century , he supposed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger friend , " he found himself saying . <p> " It 's you I want to be with . " She shrugged shyly , running her hand along a tall row of erect leaves . <p> Among them were flowers , orange and red , parrot-colored , shaped like beaks under feathery hats : Birds of Paradise , the first he 'd ever seen . Yet something in the rank of foliage bothered him . " Say , if we 're in the wilderness , why are these flowers in such a straight line ? " <p> " We were talking about us ? " <p> " Sorry . I guess we have to get beyond the paved part of the trail to see , uh , raw nature . " He sucked in a breath and tried again . " And speaking of raw nature , what I was trying to say was , I mean , there we 'll be , me wanting to be with you too , in the same small tent . That 's kind of intimate for , uh . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want to get to know you really well . The Wordsworth stuff was a bit of an excuse . " <p> " Ah . Because . . . ? " <p> She stopped now and he could see in her eyes that she was calculating an admission , see it coming in the way she stiffened her back . " If it 's all right with you , I want to have your baby . " <p> " Ah . Okay , " Max said , his voice rising on the second syllable , taking another deep breath , returning the hug that she 'd stopped to offer , pressing her soft breasts against him . See ? he told himself . He 'd been reading her right all along <p> Still , it was a bit strange how she slipped away from turning the hug into an embrace , laughed and skipped down the trail . He tried to keep up but the weight of his pack made him stagger . <p> Then the switchback doubled a ridge and became a dirt path . Ghfa stopped and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . up ? ' " she recited speculatively . Before them lay a particularly lush pocket of the valley that had been obscured from the parking lot . A trade wind shower drifted by in the distance and set a rainbow over an enormous stand of red-blooming African tulip trees . She kicked some trail dust . " We 're in the wilderness now . " <p> " ' My heart leaps up/When I behold a rainbow in the sky , ' " Max recited properly . " Wordsworth had that right . " <p> Ten minutes later , rainbow still in sight , he heard her say , " How would he describe . . . ? " <p> " ' These beauteous forms . . . ' " Max offered with a confused mumble , waving his hand at the trees , having caught himself focusing on the curves of Ghia 's tight hiking shorts . <p> " Not the trees , silly . These gardenias . I do n't see any straight rows . Virgin landscape for sure . " <p> There were indeed gardenia bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , their flowers paper white . <p> " Mmmm , " he said . " Except these gardenias are n't originally native to Hawaii . I downloaded a native plant database while I was waiting for you in Lihue . Like those trees you pointed at . African tulips . Introduced species . " <p> " You 're being too technical . That does n't mean they 're not wild . " <p> " Right , though , um , technically , this bush has been , uh . . . trimmed , " Max said . He pointed to stem cuts below the first layer of leaves . <p> She looked at him peevishly . " You 're really a perfectionist . " <p> " I 'm sure if we keep hiking . . . " he said to cheer himself up . <p> Which turned out to be hot work , the hiking . After the coolness of elevation and the appealing descent , the trail crossed a dry section and climbed a side ridge , all crumbly rock and hard on the hands . They found themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dusty xeriscape of stunted vegetation . Under an increasingly intense sun they scrambled over car-sized boulders for an hour , finally crossed a parched stream bed , pulled themselves up a second ridge , and then dropped into tropical forest again . But now the coolness of the higher section was only a memory . This forest was humid ; and huge mosquitoes buzzed in the air . <p> They stopped for lunch . When he raised his Vegamite sandwich to his mouth , Max realized he was starting to smell . <p> " I do n't know , " Ghia said , her face glistening with perspiration . " Am I supposed to be feeling a kind of oneness ? " <p> He could see the couple who 'd started ten minutes before them sitting with their lunch two hundred meters ahead , and there was of course the couple behind , who 'd caught up twice and had fallen back , muttering  --  they were glowering behind a cluster of mossy boulders three hundred meters back . " At this point , no , not a oneness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Wordsworth tells us , Nature connects . You want to first concentrate on a kind of twohess , say . " He realized to his shame he was at it again , visualizing his metaphors as her sexual parts , this time staring at her breasts . <p> " The oneness comes later ? " she asked . <p> He thought of the two of them in the small tent . " You 're reading my mind . " <p> So he 'd have to bathe in the mountain-fed stream he 'd read ran beside their assigned campsite  --  icy water would get him close enough to raw nature , he supposed . For the moment he reached out for her and they hugged again . Whether she was actually responding , making a genuine move of her own or not , or whether her gesture was just the signature of growing physical exhaustion he could n't quite tell , but she put her head on his shoulder and started panning her fingers through his hair . <p> So he buried his face in her hair too , her lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're sticking your whole face in it . " <p> She was such a Twenty-first Century woman ; she made romance seem as attractive as exchanging bodily fluids with a dog . " Well , what are you doing yourself ? " She still had a grip on a strand of his hair . <p> " Do you remember , " she asked , " telling the class that back in Wordsworth 's time couples exchanged locks of hair ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> She let go and looked him in the eyes . " It 's such a wonderful idea . I 've been thinking about it for a month . And I realized that sure enough I got it from your class too . " Ghia smiled . " I love the way you inspire me . " Now she blushed . " That 's why I want to have your baby  --  there 's something in your genes that anticipates me , takes whatever 's in me one step further . " <p> He was thrilled to hear her say it again , knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Shelley now , with Keats and Fanny Brawne , with Wordsworth and Annette Vallon . <p> " Professor . . . I mean , Max . Let 's do it now . " <p> Max looked with skepticism back down the trail where the couple who had started behind them was waiting again . " I , uh , thought maybe we 'd set up camp , have a nice dinner , have a bath . . " <p> " To exchange locks of hair ? " <p> " Right . No . I mean yes . " Max dropped his pack and fumbled for his EC Army knife , the one with the little scissors . <p> " What kind of deal is this ? " he asked when they reached the campsite . For all the mosquitoes and centipedes hovering around the perimeter , the tent site turned out to be a TerraTurf " mudless " pad abutted by a numbered pipe-sized post . The cold stream ran nearby all right , but it had been set off by rocks to run behind the site like a fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounds were a meter high . The ocean was still so far away they could barely hear the surf . <p> " Thank god , " Ghia said , " I 'm ready to stop . " <p> Max heaved off his pack and detached the self-assembling tent . Ghia disappeared into the bush to collect bugs  --  he 'd learned to his dismay that she was an insecto-vegetarian , and that for dinner he 'd have to endure grubs . He 'd been forewarned by the EcoPark brochure ( " featuring the incredible variety of the last largely unexploited food source on earth " ) , even preconditioned at the IU faculty club ( " where meal worms make a meal " ) , but he 'd hoped she 'd go for the sirloin he 'd brought along . The self-assembling tent popped right up , though staking it down reminded him of Odysseus ' struggle to subdue the shape-changer Proteus . As he sorted out the prepacked gear they 'd received with her permit , he marveled at the new Emergency Position Locating Devices , little disks the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted to be very careful handling : once you pulled out the tab the Rangers up at the summit mobilized for an extraction . The rest of his chores were grunt work : setting up a rain fly and dining canopy , cleaning the fire pad , gathering some deadwood , digging a latrine . He wound up slimy with sweat and streaked with mud  --  " mudless mud , " he supposed . He grabbed the folding bucket and picked his way over sharp rocks to the clear water of the stream . The steamy air had made him think it would n't be cold after all . He 'd thought wrong . <p> " I heard you yelling " Ghia said when she returned . " Are you okay ? " <p> Max told her about his icy shower . <p> " Why did n't you use the hot water ? " she asked , moving what turned out to be a valve on the numbered pipe he 'd taken to be a marker for the campsite  --  now he could trace it across the path and straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Christ , " he said , " is n't there anything remotely natural here ? " <p> " Please do n't be so annoyed , You remind me of my father . " <p> " Look , " he said , " I think we have a right to expect an EcoPark to maintain . . . . " <p> " Of course it is n't all natural here . There has n't been anything ' all natural ' on the planet for a hundred years . You taught the class that : there 's plastic in the deepest ocean , man-made chemicals in every cloud , civilization 's debris in every landscape . " <p> " I guess I should have known better . " Max sighed . " At least there 's Wordsworth . " <p> " Who did n't spend any of his time in any wilderness either , if I remember you pointing out . Did we read about mud in his poetry ? Snakes ? Vicious mosquitoes ? You said he wrote like he was out for a picnic in a park . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tired and horny and irritated at hearing his own lecture spit back at him . " Let 's just set up the damned sleeping bags . " <p> " You 're mining it for me too . " Ghia had her hands on her hips in the same posture Acura used when she was pissed and going to cut him off . It was alarming . <p> " I 've got an idea , " Max said . " What if we just camp somewhere else ? Who 's to know ? Let 's go up on that little hill , say . " Max pointed to a lush knoll back toward the ridge . Through the trees he could see it was topped with a grove of palms and a grassy clearing . " We 'll have a great view . We 'll both be happy . " <p> It took more than an hour to get the tent back into its stuff sack and to repack the gear . Then a short hike , then they had to set up again on the lumpy site  --  but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the way north to the wide blue ocean , was breathtaking . <p> By sunset the new campsite was squared away . Max thought it might be time for him to make his move . He was scraping the last bit of grub stew off his plate as Ghia told him now how spiritual his rejection of the authorized pad had been , how the fading light stimulated her in a way she 'd never experienced . <p> Max felt her leaning against him , warm and sweet smelling  --  she 'd tucked plumeria blossoms behind her ears . <p> " What a beautiful colors , " she hummed . <p> He dredged his mind for some lines to rehabilitate Wordsworth , found them : " ' Live in the yellow light , ' " he recited , ' " ye distant groves ! /And kindle , thou blue Ocean ! such hues/As veil the Almighty Spirit . . . . ' " <p> A crash sounded in the thicket behind them , then another . Then the bush itself began to move : a troop of Boy Scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sat nay wristwatches . They marched directly into their campsite and spread out . One of the kids asked if they were part of the night mapping exercises on the hill . <p> Max wrestled with the tent ; it was nearly dark as he and Ghia hiked back to their authorized camping pad . <p> <p> BY THE TIME he set the tent up for the third time it was eleven P.M. This time he took a hot shower . As midnight approached he had the satisfaction of velcroing the two sleeping bags together into a double bag with just enough room for them to seriously cuddle . <p> " I suppose that 's the way , " Ghia muttered over his shoulder . At her insistence he 'd set one Emergency Position Locating Device and a flashlight at each side of the bag . " You do n't know what can happen out in the wild like this , " she 'd said <p> He discreetly left the tent as she changed into her sleeping clothes . He set the PowerCoals on the campfire pad to glow romantically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own clothes and folded them over a low branch . When he crawled into the dim tent and slid his leg into the bag , he was naked . <p> " Now , " Max said , " I 'd like to show you something actually natural for a change . " <p> The precise moment his bare thigh brushed her skin she screamed , a huge deep-lunged scream , her mouth near enough to his ear to set his head ringing . <p> Max lurched to his knees and grabbed his flashlight  --  but when he switched it on he was holding it backwards . The bright beam unfortunately spotlit his privates , then partially blinded him . She continued to scream . Finally he aimed the light out the tent door , stumbled out through the flap , saw nothing , tripped back in , slapping at the bite of a particularly aggressive mosquito . The first thing he noticed was how fetchingly tight her synsilk nightshirt was , how her nipples had come erect synergistically with his own anatomy . Then he noticed the red cycle light blinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sleeping bag . <p> " What did you do ? There was n't anything out there . What . . . what . . . . Oh my god . Now they 're going to extract us . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said . <p> Max dragged the disordered bag around his waist , appalled at the cycle light , trying to take in their new situation . " Sorry ? Christ , Ghia ! Rangers 'll be here in twenty minutes . " <p> " I said I 'm sorry . The way you went outside to check for like a wild animal ? I guess you really do only mean well . " <p> " Look , " he said , " we have a little under twenty minutes . There 's just time . . . . We can still get it on . " <p> " Do n't be gross , " she told him . <p> " You 're the one who said you wanted to have my baby . " <p> " Sex is for my boyfriend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghia : you 're the one who said you wanted my baby . " The tent seemed to be spinning around him . <p> " Right , " Ghia said . " And now that I have a lock of your hair , I have a sample of your DNA . I can have your baby when I want to have a baby . What did you think . . . ? Gee , you know , you 're the one who gave me the idea about the hair . But to have sex with a man as old as my father ? God , what a gross idea . " <p> " Thanks a lot . " <p> " Do n't be so mad . To tell the truth , I 'm almost tempted . It 's going to be a whole week before I hike out of here and see Bruno . " <p> " What do you mean , a whole week ? You do n't understand . You pop the alarm , the law says you go out with the Rangers . There 's a forty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well actually , I do n't have to go out . I only tripped your locator . See ? You 're the only one who has to go . " Sure enough , the EPLD at her pillow lay inert . " Honestly , I 'm disappointed too , " she went on . " I really learned a lot about Wordsworth today . Now there wo n't be any more lessons for me . " <p> " Yes , there will , " Max said , reaching over and lifting the headphone shaped device from beside her pillow . " Here 's a lesson about raw human nature . " <p> " Oh , my god , do n't . . . . " <p> Her emergency locator made a barely audible whirring sound when he ripped out its red tab . He wondered if the muffled sound of a helicopter he could already hear in the distance was for them . <p> " And give me my hair back , " he said in the blinking light . <p> Back in Bloomington the streets were empty , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trails around the volcano on the Big Island , the gaudy casinos at Waikiki . <p> Acura picked him up at the airport wearing a trenchcoat , which he thought was very odd for a sunny day , but when they got to the parking lot , she flashed it wide open . His surprise made him drop his backpack Beneath the coat she was wearing only scanty lingerie  --  a kind of tiger outfit with a push up bra and high cut on the hips . <p> " Wha . . . ? " <p> " Call me Wild Thang , " she said . " I did some soul searching while you were gone . This is the real me . " <p> He was discreet enough not to mention the possible role jealousy might have played in her deliberations , not that afternoon , or that evening , or that night , or the next morning , when she 'd finally drank all the champagne , exhausted them both , and nearly physically handicapped herself for life . <p> " Lord , " he said , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thinking. ? " she asked . " Really . " <p> " Really ? I 'm remembering some Wordsworth . " <p> " Recite it for me . " <p> " The lines are from ' The Prelude ' : ' Not in Utopia , ' Wordsworth wrote , ' Or some secreted Island , Heaven knows where ! /But in the very world , which is the world/Of all of us ,  --  is the place where in the end/We find our happiness , or not at all ! ' What it means , counselor , is that I 'm happy to be home .
