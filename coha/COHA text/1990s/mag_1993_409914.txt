Nestled in a valley of one of New York City 's most affluent suburbs is the only maximum-security prison for women in the state . Were it not for the 15-foot-tall , touch-sensitive fences that encircle the compound , the squat , brick buildings within could be those of any college . We are met by Sharon Smolick , director of the Family Violence program at the prison since 1987 . Sharon , both an ex-con and a Revson Fellow from Columbia University , gestures in the direction of the guardhouse as the entrance gate grinds to a close . " How many escape attempts does the facility have to contend with each year ? " I ask her . " I 've never heard of one in the five years I 've been here , " she says . " Not one ? " " In fact , the last took place several years before I arrived . Women just do not have the same reaction to incarceration that men do . Nationally and internationally , women simply do not try to escape . I believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on the run . The great majority of the inmates here have children or family obligations . They know that taking off is n't going to make things easier on them  --  or their kids . In addition , many find that they can spend some productive time here . It 's horrifically ironic , but these women discovered that prison was the first place where they were clothed , fed , sheltered , and listened to in their entire lives . " Sharon listens to the women at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility with devout patience . A former inmate , she began to dispose of a lifetime 's anger by educating herself . For six years , she has been both friend and confidante to the women at Bedford , slowly coaxing the fear from them by simply taking an interest . At 10:00 A.M. , the pathways between the main cell-block buildings are crowded with women wielding brooms , rakes , and paint brushes , many wearing very informal , brightly colored shirts and dresses . " There 's some latitude as far as dress is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must wear green pants if they wear shirts , or a green dress or skirt otherwise . They can wear something over the dress if they like , but the green element must be visible at all times . No blue , black , or orange on anything though . " " Why 's that ? " " Blue and black are the colors of the officer 's uniforms , and their raincoats are orange . A basic security precaution . " Thirty-four percent of the 700 inmates at Bedford have been convicted of a capital offense  --  murder , conspiracy to murder , and kidnapping among the most common . Although it must house all the women offenders in the state whose sentences require maximum security , Bedford is dwarfed by its male counterparts such as Sing Sing and Attica . It is unlike men 's institutions in other ways as well . There are no dogs and no sharpshooters peering from watchtowers , just a lone officer in an attendant 's booth at the main gate who smiles as he checks IDs . Inside the front gate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of informality disappears , and the walls close in as the security procedures begin : A menacingly large metal detector sends alarms coursing through the hall upon identifying pens , eyeglass frames , even the shoelace eyelets on boots . After several minutes on the phone with both the superintendent 's office and the state 's Department of Corrections in Albany , Sharon is able to clear our cassette recorder through the guard post . C.J. was convicted of robbery and murder in Illinois in 1976 . While on appeal bond in 1984 , she was arrested for robbery in New York State and has not left a prison since . She celebrated her 38th birthday in Bedford this May . C.J. offers no excuses for and asks no sympathy from the people she speaks with . It makes sense to her now , though , that she had so little appreciation for life after a childhood in which her stepfather  --  a police officer  --  battered her with blackjacks and nightsticks from the time she was six . CJ : As I grew up I began to think that men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men took care of things . My husband did . He was a Vietnam vet and acted out physically as soon as he came back . More than once I woke up with a knife to my throat . He would be having a nightmare and think I was the enemy I guess . One day in December he beat me so bad that I went into shock . My body just shut down . He got scared and took me to the hospital , and the next thing I remember was the examining room . The doctors knew I had been beaten . They kept me in the hospital in an attempt to try and protect me . But my husband came up to the room I shared with another woman and started slapping me around , saying , " You better not tell anyone about it . " I freaked and started screaming , pressing all kinds of buttons trying to get somebody . Some attendants came in and put him out . As he was leaving he said he was going to take my son and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to do something . As soon as I got out of the hospital , my mother , who I had n't spoken to in years , came with me to his house and we just marched in and took my boy back . Well , I went into another mode at that point . Soon everything that I had stuffed inside for so many years began to jump out of me . I was always angry but I started looking at things in a much different light . I would sit and watch men harass girls on the street and say to myself , " Hey , if this woman ca n't , you know , defend herself against men , then I am going to do it for her . I am not going to let this happen to another woman . " It seems stupid to me now , but for some reason the mechanism that I was running under at the time told me that I had to teach men they could not go around doing whatever they wanted to women . So I would pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would set them up . Pimps , quite a few pimps . They would think they were going to get one thing , but they would find out different . PT : Could you be more specific ? CJ : I would beat them , pistol-whip them , and take their money . PT : And they thought they were going to get what ? CJ : Sex . PT : How many times did this happen ? CJ : Oh , twenty times . PT : What was more important to you , the money or the revenge ? CJ : I was n't rich , but money was never the reason why I did it . I needed to rob them of their dignity first , and taking the money they had was just another way of hurting them . PT : How far did you go ? Did you ever seriously injure anyone ? CJ : Well , there was this one man  --  a very big man that talked in a Norwegian accent . I wound up having to stab him because he was fighting me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of there , because I had a bad feeling . I was running to get away , he chased me and grabbed me from behind . I turned around and he was reaching for my throat . I cut him from here to here ( draws a line from wrist to elbow ) . Blood spurted on my shirt . He staggered back . I was trying to tell him , " Look , I really did n't want to hurt you that bad . " I took his shirt and wrapped his arm up . I did n't want him to die . I just wanted him to feel pain . So I made sure  --  thank God the hospital was only a block and a half away  --  made sure that he got to his car , you know , and told him where the hospital was . PT : What were the circumstances surrounding the murder charge in 1976 ? CJ : I was dating a bad guy at the time . I knew he was bad , that he was committing crimes , but I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . One day he asked me to drive him to the house of someone he knew , so I did it . I waited in the car and he came running out . He told me he just killed the guy inside , and now I had to get us the hell out of there . Did n't get too far though . We got caught and I was up for murder . PT : Even though you did n't know what was really going on at the time ? CJ : The law says that if I 'm driving a murderer away from the scene of the crime , I 'm a murderer too . That 's it . And yeah , I was completely out of it to be dating a crazy guy , but everything I did then was crazy . I did n't know what normal was . " C.J. was not going to stop until she was dead , " Sharon tells me in her office . " I have no way of knowing what really happened to her when she was a kid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it had to have a terrifying effect on how she perceived men . " I 'm not attempting to exonerate CJ . She committed some very serious crimes , but it 's important to understand that a great many of the women here , like her , had their sense of right and wrong badly distorted from a very early age . To many , prison was the natural extension of a childhood in which abuse was the only communication . " And make no mistake , the majority of the people here learned their strength and anger at home . They survived beatings with iron cords , belts , fists , and worse . They survived being sexually assaulted at the age of four , five , and six . Their nightmare , and that of their victims , is that they took revenge upon others . In most cases women will not or can not avenge themselves upon their attacker , but they do not remain silent and passive forever . It is often an innocent person who winds up paying with their lives . " The April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times contained a story detailing the discovery by police of the body of 62-year-old real-estate broker Thomas Vigliarolo in a tenement on West 142nd Street in Harlem . The victim , who had been starved , burned , beaten continuously , and eventually asphyxiated during nine days of captivity , was reported missing by his wife on March 20 . A ransom demand for $430,000 was finally made eight days later . A police investigation revealed a network of seven abductors , four of them women , who hatched the scheme because the victim had supposedly swindled one of the group out of $160,000 . An eyewitness identified 18-year-old model Donna Hylton as the deliverer of the ransom note to a business associate of the victim , and she was the last of the gang to be arrested . All seven members were charged with murder , convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life . The case quickly became ample fodder for the New York tabloids , with Donna 's professional photograph displayed prominently alongside every article . DH : It 's strange  --  after all these years , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone when it rings . If I 'm in Sharon 's office and a phone two feet away from me rings , I ca n't touch it . I ca n't decide when to eat or sleep . Even holding hands with another woman sets people off because they 're afraid that we 're having sex . Little things you take for granted . PT : You were just starting a career in modeling in 1985 . How did you go from that to involvement in a kidnapping ? DH : I never wanted to become involved in the first place . It 's true that I was just getting my first chance at modeling back then , and I was pretty broke . My friend Maria Talag suggested that some people she knew might be able to help me financially . It was stupid to think that people are just going to help me out for no reason , but I was 17 and I trusted her . I needed friends pretty badly and was n't choosing them very well , I guess . She invited me and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but first we were supposed to pick up this businessman , Vigliarolo , at a cafe . I 'd never met him before so it all seemed fine at the time . We picked him up and he seemed like a nice enough guy . We talked at the cafe for a while and then went to Queens . When we got there and sat down , three big Filipino guys came in and said that they would kill us all , including my baby daughter , if we did n't cooperate . I did what they told me to do after that . PT : What did you do ? DH : I drove the car from there to the place in Harlem where he Vigliarolo was kept . Most of the time I was just driving Maria and the guys to different places in the city after that . They knew that I looked young and pretty and would n't attract much attention from the cops if they saw me driving around . PT : So you did this for them over the course of several days ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be able to get away for a minute without them finding me . And I could n't think of my daughter being hurt . When Maria and the others got arrested , there was no way for me to prove that I was forced to do what I did . I mean , Maria was n't about to testify on my behalf and neither were the others , so my two friends and I were kidnappers and murderers . That 's it . PT : What are the days like here ? DH : At 5:30 in the morning the guards take the first count . They travel through the cell blocks and take a head count while we 're asleep . Most of the time it wakes you up . The doors to the cells open at 6 A.M. ; we have half an hour to shower and dress , and breakfast is served just after . One of the things that got to me at first is that there are n't any mirrors here . Too dangerous I guess . I was so used to waking up every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face . Here there are these panels of safety metal that I can see a distorted reflection in , but I have n't really seen what I look like in seven years . Strange just to think of it . PT : And the rest of the day ? DH : There 's lock-downs at midday and in the afternoon . Everybody has to go back to their cells , the doors close , and the guards take another head count . If the number is n't right , the watch commander does n't let anybody move until the problem is fixed . Lock-downs can take a while . Since there 's only enough room in our cells for a bed , dresser , chair , and cabinet , you get panicky pretty quick . It 's the strangest time when you are sitting still in there , waiting for the doors to open . I convince myself sometimes that they never will , that I 'll never hear the bolts sliding off . Most of the women go to school or some kind of support group in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once I get my bachelor 's in a few months , that 's gon na be the end of the line . There 's some talk of a master 's program , but right now it 's just talk . My main job both days and nights is counseling other inmates , helping them adjust . PT : How is your daughter ? MI : I have n't seen her in a couple of years . When I came into the system , I was young and dumb and everyone told me to give custody to her father because she would need the stability of a full-time dad . He began to abuse her just after that . Then he violated the custody agreement by not letting me see her . Now he 's at large , I guess . Sharon tells me that there 's a warrant out for his arrest . I just hope my girl is all right . PT : How do you survive with all of your anger ? DH : For a long time I did n't . For years after I arrived , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt like screaming , " I wo n't get out of this place for 25 years ! How could I be here ? I have a daughter I 'll never be able to raise . " Those feelings went on for years . I even felt more hatred for the people who tried to listen . I did n't want to hear , or think , about anything . I got into a lot of trouble . PT : What kind of trouble ? DH : I fought a lot . You can get into a fight every 10 seconds in here if you want to . I figured that I was going to spend the rest of my life locked up ... so what the hell ? A lot of the women here feel the same way . Just look at them the wrong way and they 'll go right for your eyes . PT : What kind of punishment did you receive for fighting ? DH : I was sent to solitary . For serious offenses we were sent to Little House on the Prairie , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prison compound . It was a long walk to that block , knowing that you were n't going to see anyone for at least 30 days . Once you 're in , it 's just you and the cell for 23 hours a day . They let you out to take a walk for an hour and they let you have a shower every three days , but other than that , you 're all alone . PT : When did the fighting end ? DH : In about 1990 , I began to find out that I did n't want to die , or just blame myself for what happened to me . Sharon had approached me before , but I just could n't deal with the truth she wanted from me back then . The only thing that made me come around was the thought of my daughter growing up without me . I had to straighten myself out and see if I might be a mother to her again , even if it was for just a few days a month . The whole thing was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . PT : What happened to the others convicted in the case ? DH : Well , I do n't know what became of the men ... but the women are right here . PT : At Bedford ? DH : Yeah . Maria Talag and Selma Price are here somewhere . I see them around . PT : How can you deal with people who essentially ruined your future ? DH : I do n't . I ca n't get into this with them . It ca n't do me any good to do anything to them anyway . My days of fighting are over . " I ca n't do the job I have to do without being a good judge of people , " says Sharon as she sits next to Donna in her office . " And there are many women here who are desperate to blame anyone but themselves for the circumstances they 're in . But here we have a 17-year-old girl with no criminal record of any kind arrested with a group of repeat offenders like Maria Talag and Selma Price . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclination come from ? From aspiring model to kidnapper in one step ? I think this case is worthy of another look . " Theresa and Andrea have been both friends and lovers since 1976 . They each ran away from home before they were 15 years old and found what refuge they could from friends , boyfriends , and the street . The people who promised them protection were often drug dealers , and by the time they were in their early 20s they began to rob to support their addictions . PT : What was your friendship like when the worst of your addiction problems started happening ? T : We lived together . We were best friends . I was the one who decided that since we needed money for drugs we should go and rob this guy . PT : Was this a dealer you happened to know ? T : No , he was n't a dealer ; he was our next-door neighbor . And we went in through the fire escape and tried to rob him . There was a third woman who came along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrea and I looked around the house . PT : What happened ? T : He died . PT : How did he die ? T : He was strangled . PT : How ? A : I do n't know . We all really ca n't say . We tied him up when we first got in there . We tied him up with his feet and his neck kind of roped together . Kind of hog-tied him . Maybe he fell pushing himself or whatever , you know . We are not clear . I know the guy died . PT : And the cause of death was asphyxiation ? T : Yes . A : But the whole time he was in there , this other woman was with him . PT : Did n't she know that he was strangling to death ? T : We did n't even know he died right away . We only found out when the police came . There was this other guy in the hallway . He heard the commotion in the apartment and he called the police . PT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up , you got your money , and you took off . T : Right , and I was in shock . I was like , " Oh , damn , it could n't have been that tight that it would strangle him . " And I questioned the other girl at the time and she said , " No , I did n't hurt him . " Later on we found out that she 'd had a lot of psychological problems since she was like five or six years old , a whole lot of stuff that we did n't know that came out in the trial . PT : How do you feel about the man who died ? A : At the time , I do n't think it hit us at all . We needed drugs and were going to do just about goddamn anything to get what we needed . It was a road that had no end to it . Still does n't . The drugs owned me , and we both knew we were going to die any minute . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the guy . PT : How many times did you rob people for the money you needed ? T : Lots of times . We were taking crazy chances . We were doing a lot of crazy things . We would just set people up , then rob them . PT : How were you setting them up ? T : Andrea was the con artist . She would find out where the money was , tell me , and I would go back and get it . PT : Can you explain ? A : I was an impeccable dresser , and you could n't tell that I used drugs at that time . So I could be fairly attractive when I needed to be . And I would pick up some guy I knew had money connections and say to him , " Let 's go to your place . " And they always went . I would go to their place , scam them till I found out where the money was , where the hiding places were , or whatever . I would say goodnight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take whatever stash there was . She was the burglar and I was the con . PT : And this went on for years ? T : We played so many con games , you would n't believe it . I had drugged myself down to just about 80 pounds then , and everybody thought I was a little boy anyway , so we would con people into thinking that I was her son . PT : How has prison changed you both ? A : Prison just forces you to deal with the truth . I know I wo n't use drugs anymore . When I was faced with all that time by myself , I learned why I used drugs and why I did the things I did . I am an incest survivor , and I was molested by my grandfather when I was three . And then I was molested by my sister when I was older . I was sexually molested all my life by different people , so-called family who lived with me . My brother-in-law , my uncle , grandfather ... T : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick . You could tell since I was younger that I was going to be gay or something . I did n't like to wear skirts or nothing like that . My father could n't stand it that I was n't the girl he wanted . At that time , in that era , the way that I wanted to dress was a no-no . I used to come home and guests would say , " So that 's your son ? " My mother would get in an outrage and my Dad would beat me up , throw my clothes in the incinerator and things like that . They did n't want to accept it , so I was out there by myself . PT : How old were you TH : I was around 15 when I took off . They busted me for the first time the day after my 18th birthday . Life did n't get a whole lot better after that either . I was 21 when I lost my daughter . PT : What happened ? TH : I was pregnant and I got hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted a kid so bad . All the women that I knew had children . I thought I was meant to have one of my own  --  something that belonged to me . So , I set this thing up to have a baby . And I was just so lucky that I did it one time and I got pregnant . And I was about five and a half months pregnant and I got hit by a car . She lived for four days after the accident . And I had to go to the burial and all that . After that , I did n't care about anything . I was doing everything in the street and I did n't care what anyone did or said . I had the kind of attitude like " If you want to kill me , come on . " I met Andrea during that time . PT : And you 've been together ever since ? A : Seventeen years . Thirteen years spent in here . PT : Can you carry on the same relationship while in prison ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're best friends though , you know . I mean we do n't have the greatest relationship in the world . There are tough days in here , but we could n't get along without each other . And there is nothing I could n't tell her , nothing that she could n't do for me . She is just cool . She has always been in my corner . PT : And you 're up for parole together in ... ? A : The year 2000 . We 'll be up for the same hearing together . T : The same release date , too . Till then , we 'll just keep on hoping . <p>
