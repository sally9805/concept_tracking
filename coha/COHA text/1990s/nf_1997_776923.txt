CLASSIFICATION AND GENERAL BIOLOGY // Venerable , sometimes conflicting , traditions shape our views of nature , and humans were enthralled by slithering gaits , venomous bites , and various legendary attributes of snakelike animals long before recorded history . Some Native American petroglyphs depict fanciful horned organisms , only their elongate shapes suggestive of serpents , while others accurately portray rattlesnakes . Realistic Water Pythons ( Liasis fuscus ) and Common Death Adders ( Acanthophis antarcticus ) appear in the " dream time " paintings of Australian aborigines , whereas rural people in the southeastern United States still refer to certain lizards with long , fragile tails as " glass snakes "  --  focusing on limblessness rather than the external ear openings and eyelids never found on true serpents . Even biologists portray snakes mainly in terms of locomotion and feeding , although two thousand years ago Aristotle hinted at the truth when he linked forked tongues with a " twofold pleasure from savours , their gustatory sensation being as it were doubled . " Perhaps this key characteristic is largely overlooked because of human antipathy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as fuzzy notions about what exactly is a snake . // The lives of serpents are exquisitely permeated by chemical phenomena . If newborn Queen Snakes ( Regina septemvittata ) are experimentally offered diverse odor samples on cotton swabs , they attack the molecular signature of freshly molted crayfish ( the sole item in their natural diet ) and ignore all others . Black-tailed Rattlesnakes ( Crotalus molossus ) use the distinctive spoor of woodrats ( Neotoma ) to choose strategic ambush sites near the runways and nest entrances of their favored prey . A male Plains Gartersnake ( Thamnophis radix ) deftly follows females by assessing pheromone trails on vegetation , and tropical snakes presumably distinguish their own kind by odor from among the five or six dozen species in a rain forest . By contrast , fresh-baked bread and barbecue smoke offer us pleasant but uninspiring hints of a chemical worldview . The fragrances of Kelly 's hair when I first awake and of the desert after a thunderstorm are more impressive examples , flooding me with joy and hope before I consciously afford them meaning . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley freeway , my daydreams suddenly shifted from rattlesnakes to creamy tomato soup and crackers . Minutes later , passing a huge produce truck and still wondering why visions of childhood snacks had drifted in from nowhere , I realized I 'd been traveling in the odor plume of an open load of tomatoes . // Early classifications of reptiles were based mainly on shapes and external structures as seen in museum specimens . Extensive attention to internal characteristics began in the 1800s with A.-M. - Constant Dumeril , a Parisian savant , and blossomed thereafter with studies of lungs , reproductive organs , and vertebrae by Edward D. Cope in the United States . Nevertheless , until the turn of the century even herpetologists still considered some elongate lizards " snakes " and called limbless amphibians " pseudophidians , " or false snakes . A fairly stable arrangement consistent with fossils emerged only with the work of French paleontologist Robert Hoffstetter in the 1950s , and the composition of snakes as a group continued to depend on whether certain extinct forms were included . Lists of definitive characteristics have appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't recognize a snake as a snake from " lateral closure of the braincase wall " and other such features ! // Novel ways of studying snakes were paralleled over the last two centuries by shifts in the philosophy of biological classification , from imposing order on God 's Universe to portraying evolutionary history . Consensus is emerging , influenced by new data and new viewpoints , and relationships among major lineages are increasingly clear . For example , the formal category " Serpentes " includes the most recent common ancestor of extant snakes and all descendants of that ancestor  --  a definition that emphasizes living , intact organisms ( about which more is known ) and avoids the problem of whether certain poorly preserved fossils really are " snakes . " The oldest evolutionary divergence was between blindsnakes and other serpents , although those two groups are not as different as once thought . Most important , our current concept coincides with neither complete limblessness nor eating really large prey , a fact that would surprise many biologists . Both of those traits actually arose after the origin of snakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // With accurate notions of their membership , we can more confidently characterize the evolutionary chronicle of serpents . They arose from nearly limbless lizards , and although some snakes have expansive mouths , others still have the relatively inflexible jaws that typified their common ancestor . In addition to serpentine locomotion and feeding specializations , the origin of snakes foreshadowed an increased reliance on chemical cues  --  and innovations at both ends ! A highly mobile tongue carries molecules to a receptor organ in the roof of the mouth , and the tongue 's deeply forked shape facilitates directional localization of an odor 's source . Snakes use those structures to explore a chemical world perhaps analogous in complexity and subliminal nuance to the textures and colors we perceive visually . Furthermore , all serpents have paired glands in the tail base from which foul substances are smeared about during encounters with predators . Twin innovations thus underlie a spectacular array of locomotor , feeding , and social activities : forked tongues facilitate intensive searching for mates , places to hide , and food , while tail glands protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other chemically mediated responses is an exciting challenge for science ; meanwhile , the everyday lives of serpents are more easily imagined when I remember Kelly 's hair , desert thunderstorms , and that truckload of tomatoes . // Beyond coining scientific names ( an activity known as taxonomy ) , phylogenetic systematics is a branch of biology that discerns the history of evolutionary divergence among organisms and categorizes them accordingly . Within that framework , herpetologists divide and subdivide the 2,700 species of snakes into manageable groups , making sense of diversity by searching for similarities and dissimilarities among them . Throughout this book the numbers in those groups are approximate , both because of uncertainties about the status of some species and because new kinds of snakes are discovered each year . // This chapter introduces scientific nomenclature and common names . Even many biologists are unfamiliar with recent refinements , so some implications of phylogenetic systematics for understanding snakes are explained further in the Appendix . Here I also survey the major groups of snakes as background for the topics that follow , then summarize aspects of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCIENTIFIC AND COMMON NAMES // For more than two hundred years biologists have used a binomial nomenclature pioneered by Carl von Linne , in which each species is known by a unique combination of italicized generic and specific names . The words themselves are derived from Latin or Greek or based on Latin endings . For example , the scientific name of the Western Rattlesnake is Crotalus viridis . Its species epithet , the second word , is Latin , meaning " green in color " ; that species is one of thirty assigned to the genus Crotalus , based on the Greek word krotalon , meaning " a rattle . " A formally named group of organisms , such as the genus Crotalus or the species Crotalus viridis , is called a " taxon . " Subspecies , or geographical races within a species , have a third latinized name . In the first subspecies to be described , the subspecies name automatically repeats the species name : for example , the nominate subspecies of the Western Rattlesnake is Crotalus viridis viridis ( Prairie Rattlesnake ) . In subsequently described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Crotalus viridis cerberus ( Arizona Black Rattlesnake ) . Genera and species often are abbreviated , as in C. v. viridis and C. v. cerberus . Definitions and some conceptual problems with species and subspecies are discussed in the Appendix . // Common names have no standing in biological nomenclature yet play an important role in communication among laypeople . I generally use English names in vogue for particular regions but follow personal preference in a few cases  --  I would as soon call a Black-headed Python ( Aspidites melanocephalus ) a " Teenage Pimple Serpent " as refer to colubrids of the genus Tantilla by their " standard " common name , blackhead snakes ! I capitalize English names for plant and animal species ( but not genera and other groups of species ) , to distinguish them from adjectives ( e.g. , dwarf , brown ) . In the interest of compactness , and with " rattlesnake " as a model , I combine words for groups of species ( e.g. , " seakraits " Laticauda ) , as opposed to single species ( e.g. , " Gopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root is one syllable with five or fewer letters and the modifier has no more than two syllables and six letters ( e.g. , " coralsnakes " versus " calico snakes " Oxyrhopus ) . English names for some higher taxa ( e.g. , " boas " for Boidae ) are widely familiar , but I invented " dwarf pipesnakes " for Anomochilus ; lacking popular alternatives , herpetologists call members of the largest snake family " colubrids " and refer to cobras and their relatives collectively as " elapids . " Some laypeople find scientific names difficult , and many biologists are unfamiliar with common and scientific names outside their area of expertise , so I use English names whenever possible and provide scientific names for genera and species at the first mention in each introductory essay , text paragraph , special topic section , and photograph caption . Common and scientific names are cross-referenced in the Index . // SNAKES AND OTHER VERTEBRATES // In traditional Linnean taxonomy , groups above the species level ( called " higher taxa " ) are assigned to ranked categories that supposedly represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar , presumably related species ( e.g. , most rattlesnakes in Crotalus ) ; families , denoted by the ending " - idae , " are groups of similar , presumably related genera ( e.g. , cobras , seasnakes , and their relatives in Elapidae ) ; orders are groups of similar , presumably related families ( e.g. , lizards and snakes in Squamata ) ; and so on . Finer divisions in the ranked categories are sometimes used , most frequently subfamilies ( denoted by the ending " - inae , " as in Crotalinae for pitvipers , a subfamily within Viperidae ) . Tribes , denoted by the ending " - ini , " are sometimes designated for groups of genera within subfamilies , ( e.g. , Sonorini for groundsnakes Sonora and their relatives within Colubrinae ) . // In point of fact , traditional classifications often fail to portray evolutionary relationships , as illustrated by the following familiar ranked system : // Class Amphibia ( amphibians ) // Class Reptilia ( reptiles ) // Order Chelonia ( turtles ) // Order Crocodylia ( crocodilians ) // Order Sphenodontida ( tuataras ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Class Aves ( birds ) // Class Mammalia ( mammals ) // The above scheme omits the origins of four limbs in the common ancestor of terrestrial vertebrates ( there is no named group for all four classes ) , fails to signify the origin of the shelled egg within that group ( there is no named group for mammals , " reptiles , " and birds ) , and ignores the fact that crocodilians and birds are more closely related to each other than either of them is to any of the others  --  all highly significant events in vertebrate evolution ! // By contrast , phylogenetic classifications express evolutionary divergences as equally indented sister taxa ( i.e. , those most recently sharing a common ancestor ; more than two taxa are indented equally when their phylogenetic relationships are uncertain ) . Each set of descendant , equally indented taxa is referred to by the next higher , less indented name . For example , amphibians and amniotes are each other 's closest relatives ( they are sister taxa ) , collectively known as tetrapods ; conversely , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister taxon , the amniotes . The historical relationships of snakes with other major groups of living terrestrial vertebrates can be retrieved from the following phylogenetic classification ( Fig. 1 expresses these relationships as a phylogenetic tree or cladogram ; Chapter 15 discusses relationships within Squamata in more detail ) : // Tetrapoda ( four-limbed vertebrates ) Amphibia ( frogs , salamanders , caecilians ) Amniota ( tetrapods with three embryonic membranes ) Mammalia ( mammals ) Reptilia ( " reptiles " and birds ) Chelonia ( turtles ) Sauria ( archosaurs and lepidosaurs ) Archosauria ( crocodilians and birds ) Crocodylia ( crocodilians ) Aves ( birds ) Lepidosauria ( tuataras and squamates ) Sphenodontida ( tuataras ) Squamata ( squamates ) Iguania ( iguanas , chameleons , etc . ) Scleroglossa ( other lizards , amphisbaenians , snakes ) Gekkota ( geckos and flap-footed lizards ) Autarchoglossa ( other lizards , amphisbaenians , snakes ) // Snakes have diverged from ancestral conditions of the larger taxa to which they pertain , sometimes strikingly so , but also reflect their heritage as members of those more inclusive groups . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among many characteristics of Vertebrata ( a larger group including Tetrapoda and various fish ) . They share numerous features typical of tetrapods yet for the most part lack the girdles and limbs used for locomotion by most other members of that group . Like amniotes but unlike amphibians , the first snakes laid shelled eggs with three embryonic membranes ( including the amnion , hence the larger group 's name ) , although now many squamates and most mammals are viviparous . Snakes share numerous anatomical characteristics with other reptiles ( including birds ) , by which they all differ from mammals ( the sister taxon of reptiles within Amniota ) . // Among living Reptilia , the sister taxon of Squamata is Sphenodontida , encompassing two species of New Zealand tuataras ( Sphenodon ) ; together squamates and tuataras are named Lepidosauria . All squamates share numerous derived characteristics , including paired copulatory organs in males . Traditionally the approximately 6,700 living species of Squamata have been divided into lizards ( Suborder Lacertilia , often inappropriately called Sauria ) , amphisbaenians ( Suborder Amphisbaenia ; see p. 48 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Phylogenetic systematists reject that arrangement because Lacertilia is not monophyletic ; monitors ( Varanidae ) , alligator lizards ( Anguidae ) , and their relatives probably are more closely related to snakes than to other lizards , while whiptails ( Teiidae ) and their relatives might be more closely related to amphisbaenians than to some other lizards ( see the Appendix for definitions of monophyly , paraphyly , and polyphyly ) . Actually , amphisbaenians and snakes are lizards in exactly the same sense that humans are primates , primates are mammals , and so forth . // CLASSIFICATION AND THE DIVERGENCE OF HIGHER SNAKE TAXA // The arrangement of major snake groups herein reflects well-supported evolutionary divergence and monophyletic relationships . Rather than name them all formally , I designate one group by a bracketed list of included taxa ; to facilitate discussion , two sets of paraphyletic basal taxa are indicated ( framed in quotes ; Fig. 2 expresses these relationships as a phylogenetic tree ) : // Serpentes Scolecophidia ( blindsnakes ) Anomalepididae Leptotyphlopidae Typhlopidae // Alethinophidia Anomochilus ( dwarf pipesnakes ) " basal alethinophidians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pipesnake ) Cylindrophis ( Asian pipesnakes ) Uropeltidae ( shield-tailed snakes ) Loxocemus bicolor ( Neotropical Sunbeam Snake ) Xenopeltis ( Asian sunbeam snakes ) // Macrostomata " basal macrostomatans " Boidae ( boas , sand boas , etc . ) Pythonidae ( pythons ) Bolyeriidae ( Round Island boas ) Tropidophiidae ( dwarf boas ) // Caenophidia ( advanced snakes ) Acrochordidae ( Australasian filesnakes ) Colubroidea Viperidae ( vipers , pitvipers ) Atractaspididae ( stiletto snakes , etc . ) Colubridae ( ratsnakes , goo-eaters , etc . ) Elapidae ( cobras , seasnakes , etc. ) // As indicated by this classification , the initial evolutionary divergence among snakes was between scolecophidians and all others , the latter as a group termed Alethinophidia ( literally , " true snakes " ) . Scolecophidians are small creatures with eyes buried beneath the skin and highly polished , round scales of uniform size throughout the body . Called blindsnakes as a group , they are placed in the Anomalepididae ( 4 genera , 15 species ) , Leptotyphlopidae ( 2 genera , 80 species ) , and Typhlopidae ( 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of Indonesian dwarf pipesnakes ) is structurally transitional between other alethinophidians and blindsnakes . Dwarf pipesnakes and five other small lineages of basal alethinophidians ( once collectively called Anilioidea or anilioids ) have undifferentiated or slightly enlarged ventral scales , stout jaws , and rather limited gapes . The other groups of living basal alethinophidians are Uropeltidae ( 9 genera , 46 species of shield-tailed snakes ) , Cylindrophis ( 9 species of Asian pipesnakes ) , Anilius scytale ( Red Pipesnake ) , Xenopeltis ( 2 species of Asian sunbeam snakes ) , and Loxocemus bicolor ( Neotropical Sunbeam Snake ) . // Basal macrostomatans ( formerly called Booidea or booids ) have moderately enlarged ventral scales and lighter , more mobile jaw elements than basal alethinophidians ; in these and some other aspects , they are transitional between the latter and caenophidians . Basal macrostomatans include Bolyeriidae ( 2 genera , 2 species of Round Island boas ) and Tropidophiidae ( 4 genera , 20 species of dwarf boas ) , as well as the better known Boidae ( 8 genera , 40 species of boas , sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 genera , 24 species of pythons ) . I informally refer to basal alethinophidians , basal macrostomatans , and Acrochordidae together as basal snakes . Although highly specialized for aquatic life , Australasian filesnakes are phylogenetically and structurally transitional between basal macrostomatans and the Colubroidea ; together Acrochordidae and Colubroidea are grouped as Caenophidia and informally called " advanced snakes . " // Colubroidea encompass Atractaspididae ( 14 genera , 65 species of stiletto snakes Atractaspis and their associates ) , Colubridae ( 290 genera , almost 1,700 species of colubrids ) , Elapidae ( 63 genera , 272 species of cobras and their relatives ) , and Viperidae ( 30 genera , 230 species of vipers and pitvipers ) . Colubroids share modifications of the skull , such that the maxillary bones are freed from their primitive role for ingestion and available for other specializations . Venomous seakraits and seasnakes ( ca. 15 genera and 55 species ) sometimes are collectively separated as the Hydrophiidae , but that taxon includes at least two independent invasions of the marine environment by Australasian elapids and thus is polyphyletic. // The timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owing in part to a relatively poor fossil record . It is discussed in more detail in Chapters 8 and 15 , but here is a general outline : The group originated in the Mesozoic era , more than 65 million years ago ( mya ) . Within the Cenozoic era that followed ( up to the present ) , advanced snakes probably arose at least as long ago as the Oligocene epoch ( 35-25 mya ) . Numerous modern snake genera are known from the Miocene epoch ( 25-5 mya ) and more recent deposits . // GENERAL ANATOMY // Snake heads vary from chunky to elongate and pointed ; snakes ' trunks may be cylindrical , tapered at each end , or compressed laterally or dorsoventrally . Some scolecophidians and basal snakes have rudimentary pelvic girdles and external hind limbs , but most serpents lack those structures . No snake has even traces of a pectoral girdle or front limbs . The musculoskeletal system of snakes is discussed later with respect to roles in locomotion ( Chapter 2 ) and feeding ( Chapter 3 ) . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total length ( snout-to-vent plus tail ) of an average adult . // The internal anatomy of serpents resembles that of other vertebrates , but the viscera are modified to fit a tubular body . Major organs usually are staggered linearly and more elongate than in other squamates ; in some snakes one member of a pair of organs is reduced or absent ( see p. 49 ) . Most basal snakes have two well-developed lungs , but in blindsnakes and colubroids the left lung is greatly reduced or lost . The right lung extends through much of a snake 's body cavity and ends in a sacklike air storage area , especially well developed in seasnakes . A snake 's esophagus extends from the mouth almost to midbody and is not sharply differentiated from the stomach ; a pyloric valve separates the latter from a looped or coiled small intestine , which in turn empties into a short , straight , large intestine . The liver is elongate and bilobed . Paired kidneys and gonads ( ovaries or testes ) are staggered beside the midline in the posterior part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right ovary is farther toward the head and the right oviduct is longer than the left . Some blindsnakes , some black-headed snakes ( Tantilla ) , and at least one atractaspidid ( Polemon notatus ) have a single ovary or oviduct , the loss of one member of the pair probably associated with streamlined bodies in these slender , fossorial creatures . As in other reptiles ( including birds ) , the cloaca is a common chamber that separately receives products of the kidneys , large intestine , and reproductive tracts ; it opens through the vent . // Like other squamates , male snakes have paired copulatory organs ( see Chapter 6 for other differences between the sexes ) . Each organ is called a hemipenis ( literally , " half-penis " ) , a name that reflects an ancient , erroneous belief that the two grooved structures were pressed together to form a single mammal-like apparatus . Each squamate hemipenis is in fact a blind , inverted cylinder that can be everted through the vent by a combination of hydraulic pressure ( from blood sinuses in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface channel ( the sulcus spermaticus , or sperm groove ) into the female 's cloaca , and a retractor muscle and reduced blood pressure invert the organ after mating . Hemipenes are stored in the base of the tail when not in use , giving the tails of male snakes a characteristically stouter shape and greater length than those of females . // The biological role of double hemipenes remains intriguing . Each copulatory organ receives sperm from only the testis on its side of the body . Common Kingsnakes ( Lampropeltis getula ) alternate the right and left hemipenes during successive copulations ; Ottoman Vipers ( Vipera xanthina ) attempt to insert whichever organ is adjacent to a female 's vent . Perhaps the squamate arrangement permits frequent copulation while ensuring recovery time for the alternating reproductive tracts . Hemipenes usually vary among species and higher taxa in shape ( e.g. , simple versus forked ) , ornamentation ( e.g. , presence or absence of spines , papillae , etc. ) , and size . As might be expected , the urogenital anatomy of males and females differs similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; inexplicably , hemipenes and female cloacae each vary among populations of the Variable Reedsnake ( Calamaria lumbricoidea ) , but not in ways that make sense in terms of their functional relationships with each other . // Cloacal scent glands are unique to and characteristic of all snakes , a fact that suggests they might have played an important role in the origin and successful radiation of the group . These glands are paired pouches , opening from the tail base into the posterior edge of the cloaca ; their typically foul-smelling contents are ejected by muscles and probably deter predators . Some blindsnakes have an additional tail gland of unknown function . // THE INTEGUMENT , COLORATION , AND ECDYSIS // Snake skin resembles that of most other reptiles , in that its scales are folded and thickened portions of the outermost layers , the dermis and epidermis . Each scale consists of an outer surface , an inner surface , a hinge zone where folding occurs , and a thin free margin that usually overlaps adjacent scales  --  all easily seen on a freshly shed skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as keels ) , and they usually overlap other scales posteriorly . Small pits and tubercles are sometimes visible with the naked eye , especially on the head , and the scale surfaces also are marked by microscopic ridges , tubercles , and other structures that differ among species and higher taxa . // Boas , pythons , and many vipers have small , irregularly arranged head scales , in contrast to the large , symmetrical head scales ( also known as plates or shields ) of most advanced snakes . Moving from front to back over the head , these large scales are the rostral ( covering the snout ) , internasals ( usually paired , behind the rostral ) , prefrontals ( usually paired , behind the internasals ) , supraoculars ( often fragmented , just over the eyes ) , frontal ( between the supraoculars ) , and parietals ( paired , behind the frontal ) . Supralabial ( upper ) and infralabial ( lower ) lip scales border the mouths of snakes on each side . Behind each nasal scale ( including or adjacent to the nostril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behind each eye , between the supralabials and parietals , are postocular and temporal scales . On the underside of the head , an anterior mental scale generally is followed by large , paired chin shields and smaller gular scales . Most snakes have a longitudinal mental groove between rows of chin scales , but a few groups lack this expansion pleat ( e.g. , blindsnakes , dwarf pipesnakes Anomochilus , and some colubroids that feed on slimy invertebrates ) . // Dorsal body scales typically overlap in diagonal , usually odd-numbered rows ; these range from a dozen or so ( e.g. , ten in Tiger Ratsnake Spilotes pullatus , thirteen in Asian coralsnakes Calliophis ) to more than ninety in some seasnakes . In burrowers and other slender species , row counts of dorsal scales are low and relatively constant along the body , whereas in stocky serpents with tapered anterior and posterior parts the numbers are high at midbody and decrease at each end . Males of the Short Seasnake ( Lapemis curtus ) have spinelike , juxtaposed dorsal scales , and mid-dorsal scales of the bizarre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knobs . Most snakes have enlarged , transverse ventral scales , but blindsnakes , most basal alethinophidians , and some seasnakes have scales that are uniform in size throughout the body . Ventral scale counts range from fewer than a hundred ( e.g. , in some African slug-eaters Duberria ) to more than five hundred in some seasnakes . In most snakes a transversely enlarged anal scale covers the cloacal opening , marking the boundary between body and tail . Snakes with differentiated ventral scales also have enlarged subcaudal scales under the tail , often paired ; these number from fewer than ten ( e.g. , in some reedsnakes Calamaria ) to more than two hundred ( e.g. , in some wolfsnakes Lycodon ) . // Many lizards have crests , casques , and other fancy ornamentations , whereas  --  perhaps because they would impede locomotion  --  elaborations of the skin are rare in snakes . Scaly appendages occur on the snouts or over the eyes of some arboreal serpents ( e.g. , Madagascan Vinesnakes Langaha nasuta ; photos , pp. 124 , 125 ; also various vipers ) and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 183 ) . Some snakes dig with an enlarged rostral scale , designed like a plow or spade ( photo , p. 43 ) . A few species have spikelike tail scales that also might aid in burrowing , and the modified tail tips of some others produce noise during antipredator displays . // Most snake skin colors result from pigments , although Asian sunbeam snakes ( Xenopeltis ) and some other species have microscopic structures that make their scales iridescent . Some boas , colubrids , and vipers become lighter at night and darken during the day . With age , melanin deposits in the skin often obscure the bright patterns of juvenile snakes ; examples of such ontogenetic color shifts include several pitvipers and colubrids that are blotched or bright red as juveniles , then uniformly dark-colored as adults . Color changes sometimes vary geographically within a species , perhaps associated with changes in habitat and defensive responses : As adults , Black Ratsnakes ( Elaphe o. obsoleta ) are uniformly dark and Yellow Ratsnakes ( E. o. quadrivittata ) have black stripes on a light background , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray with a dorsal pattern of dark blotches . Adult Western Rattlesnakes ( Crotalus viridis ) are contrastingly blotched like their young over most of the range of that species , but some full-grown Arizona Black Rattlesnakes ( C. v. cerberus ) are sooty black with small golden flecks . // Adult color patterns are constant in most snake species , at least within a population . Well-known polymorphisms , however , include striped versus banded Common Kingsnakes ( Lampropeltis getula ) ; striped , banded , and unicolored Prairie Groundsnakes ( Sonora semiannulata ) ; and red versus gray or brown estuarine species in Asia ( Dog-faced Watersnake Cerberus rynchops ) and the United States ( Salt Marsh Watersnake Nerodia clarkii ) . Although popular with hobbyists , free-living snakes with truly aberrant colors and patterns are easily visible to predators and thus rare . At least in Brazil , most naturally occurring albino snakes are either nocturnal or burrowers , therefore less likely to be seen by enemies , or are venomous and thus especially capable of defense . // Molting ( shedding , ecdysis ) in reptiles results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end result  --  a shiny new skin  --  might facilitate growth , renew tissue abraded during locomotion or otherwise damaged , remove ectoparasites , and maximize chemical communication . Most squamates molt in small , ragged pieces over a period of days or weeks , but alligator lizards , amphisbaenians , and snakes typically shed their skins in one piece . Intervals between ecdysis range from a few weeks to several months and vary with temperature , health , growth , and feeding . For several days prior to molting the eyes are clouded gray or blue by fluid between the old and newly formed spectacles ; snakes in that condition are usually inactive and sometimes remain hidden . Among those I found " in the blue , " a Northern Cat-eyed Snake ( Leptodeira septentrionalis ) was hidden in a bromeliad , two Terciopelos ( Bothrops asper ) remained in burrows , several Bushmasters ( Lachesis muta ) were coiled on the forest floor , and a Lowland Bush Viper ( Atheris squamiger ) was resting on a branch . // A shedding snake rubs supralabial and infralabial scales free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of the inside-out nature of this process , the tail of the old skin points in the direction of the departing creature . Popular accounts imply that snakes shed against surface objects , but a free-living Indigo Snake ( Drymarchon corais ) was seen moving rectilinearly while spasmodic jerks loosened the skin and folded it backward ; a large Terciopelo ( Bothrops asper ) simply crawled slowly over wet forest litter , emerging from its old skin in a matter of minutes . Chapter 13 discusses specialized molting behavior in marine snakes . // THE SENSES AND PHYSIOLOGICAL ECOLOGY // Behavior and physiology link an animal with its external environment . Like most other aspects of their biology , elongate shape and limblessness profoundly affect these responses in snakes . Vegetation and other environmental obstacles are more complex at ground level , so visual and auditory cues would be less effective there than they are for elevated organisms . Moreover , snakes evolved from a secretive , perhaps burrowing ancestor and thus relinquished an emphasis on visual and airborne sound cues early in their history . // Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perceive some low-frequency airborne sounds , they hear mainly vibrations conducted via the substrate . Ground-borne sounds are transmitted through a snake 's body to the quadrate bone ( a connection between the lower jaw and the skull ) and thence through the columella ( middle-ear bone ) to the inner ear . Eyes vary from reduced or even absent in blindsnakes to birdlike globes in the Boomslang ( Dispholidus typus ) and some other colubrids . Usually the eye is protected by a convex spectacle , or brille , but head scales cover the eyes of blindsnakes and a few other taxa . Diurnal snakes have round pupils , and nocturnal species often have vertically elliptical pupils , which shut to a tight slit and thus protect especially sensitive retinas from daylight . Evolutionary history must also influence pupil shape , however , because many facultatively diurnal snakes ( e.g. , some boas , colubrids , and vipers ) have " cat eyes . " // Although humans might view ground-level environments as depauperate , the sensory world of snakes is surprisingly rich in tactile , thermal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch , because positional control mechanisms are integral to serpentine locomotion and because increased surface area enhances bodily contact during social encounters . Snake skin is indeed richly supplied with tactile receptors , and these animals seem especially responsive to touch . Pythons and boas also have highly sensitive thermal receptors in the supralabial and infralabial scales , and some vipers probably form infrared images with their facial pits ( see p. 254 ) . The Olive Seasnake ( Aipysurus laevis ) even has photoreceptors on its tail . // Chemical cues are of overriding importance in the lives of all serpents , processed by a sensory system with which we are largely unfamiliar ( see the Special Topic in this chapter ) . Their nostrils , as in other terrestrial vertebrates , are openings for respiration ; smell , however , plays a minor role in snake behavior . In contrast , they have elaborated ancestral mechanisms of autarchoglossan lizards to extremes found nowhere else among vertebrates . A deeply forked tongue gathers odor molecules , relative concentrations on the right and left tines indicating the proximity and direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are transferred from the tongue tips to the exquisitely sensitive vomeronasal ( or Jacobson 's ) organ . Taste buds , concentrated in tissue along the tooth rows , function after objects have been grasped in the mouth . Later chapters detail the roles of chemical cues in the lives of serpents. // Like most other vertebrates and with the exception of brooding pythons , snakes do not produce enough excess metabolic heat to sustain high body temperatures irrespective of their surroundings ; they are ectothermic ( " cold-blooded " is best reserved for some humans ! ) . Endothermic birds and mammals burn about ten times as much energy as ectotherms , and that , coupled with insulating feathers or fur , maintains their high body temperatures . Ectothermy does not , however , necessarily imply low or wildly fluctuating body temperatures ; some reptiles behaviorally thermoregulate at fairly constant , high levels . Ectotherms often circumvent potential disadvantages of their low-energy lifestyles : snakes can not sustain high aerobic activity for longer than a few minutes , as only endotherms can , but they escape predators by confrontation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many endotherms can operate at relatively low temperatures , whereas serpents generally are inactive during harshly cold weather ; some snakes , however , are active under surprisingly cold conditions , such as Desert Blacksnakes ( Walterinnesia aegyptia ) and European Adders ( Vipera berus ) . // Temperature influences the speed at which bodily functions proceed in ectotherms , but extreme temperatures are dangerous for slender creatures , because high surface area/mass ratios dictate rapid heating and cooling rates . Snakes consequently prefer lower body temperatures ( averaging around 30 degrees C ) than many lizards , and most desert serpents are nocturnal . Body elongation , however , has tremendous advantages : Snakes can rapidly warm and become active by extending themselves in the sun or on a hot substrate ; they can also conserve heat by coiling . Perhaps more important , differentially exposing small portions of the body lets snakes warm particular organs while remaining hidden and therefore safe from predators . // Snakes lose water through respiration , metabolic wastes , and - the more so because of high surface area/mass ratios - their skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excreting uric acid ( a white semisolid slurry with the feces ) instead of urine . Although some undoubtedly visit pools and streams , many species probably drink beads of dew or raindrops from their skin , and Peringuey 's Adder ( Bitis peringueyi ) elevates and flattens its neck to condense coastal desert fog for drinking . Some marine snakes excrete excess salt via a gland under the tongue , whereas Salt Marsh Watersnakes ( Nerodia clarkii ) simply leave their estuarine habitats to drink and thus avoid the problem of consuming too much sodium . Desert serpents are more resistant to desiccation than species in humid regions , and some psammophiine colubrids may even condition their skin with nasal gland secretions to retard water loss ( Chapter9 ) . Snakes seek moist , sheltered microhabitats during dry periods and prior to shedding , when they are especially vulnerable to water loss . // INSTINCT AND MIND : BEHAVIORAL COMPLEXITY IN SNAKES // Ethology has traditionally addressed four questions about behavior , codified by Nobel laureate Niko Tinbergen : its motivational and sensory control ; the roles of genetics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage in nature ; and its evolutionary history . Gordon M. Burghardt confronted these issues by combining undergraduate training in chemistry , rigorous experiments , and an interest in the behavior of young animals . Using the literature on natural history and some everyday cotton swabs , Burghardt 's doctoral research launched a generation of snake ethologists ; thirty years later , he is bent on revising Tinbergen 's manifesto . // As a graduate student , Burghardt presented naive , young snakes with surface washes from various potential prey , using horse meat and distilled water as experimental controls . Plains Gartersnakes ( Thamnophis radix ) briefly tongue-flicked at extracts of crickets , mice , and the controls , whereas they rapidly attacked and tried to swallow swabs laced with the odors of leeches , worms , fish , or amphibians  --  all typical prey for that species . Several other natricine colubrids also preferred extracts that coincided with their natural diets ; indeed , baby Queen Snakes ( Regina septemvittata ) reacted only to freshly molted crayfish . Not all species conformed so well to the cotton swab paradigm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gartersnakes ( T. butleri ) eat only leeches and worms , but neonates also responded to fish and frog odors , so perhaps their chemosensory preferences have not yet diverged from those of the closely related Plains Gartersnake . Corn Snakes ( Elaphe guttata ) and Cottonmouths ( Agkistrodon piscivorus ) scarcely discriminated among the extracts , but both have broad diets that shift with age and thus might be hampered if they had preprogrammed perceptual constraints . Overall , the feeding behavior of young snakes , evoked by specific stimuli and without the necessity of prior experience , nicely matches classical notions of an instinctive or inborn mechanism . // Other researchers have subsequently extended experimental approaches to many aspects of snake behavior , some discussed elsewhere in this book . Burghardt himself pursued a broad range of problems after graduate school , from chemical characterization of snake prey to behavioral development in hand-reared Black Bears ( Ursus americanus ) and free-living Green Iguanas ( Iguana iguana ) . In his teaching and writing he often stressed Jacob von Uexkuhl 's concept of Umwelt , or " outer world " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two projects sharpened his parallel concerns for the counterconcept of a perceptual inner world . Together we studied Eastern Hog-nosed Snakes ( Heterodon platirhinos ) , establishing that threatened hatchlings consistently bluffed , death-feigned , or both ; they had individually distinctive and stable behavioral profiles , although the responses could be modified by experience . Our most dramatic finding was that the little snakes would rapidly and repeatedly death-feign or right themselves and crawl , depending on whether a simulated predator ( Gordon or a stuffed owl ) watched them or averted its gaze . About the same time , Burghardt acquired a two-headed Black Ratsnake ( Elaphe o. obsoleta ) , promptly named " IM " for the conflicting concepts of instinct and mind , and accumulated many fascinating observations on its behavior . The two heads often struggled over food , and dominance shifted repeatedly over periods of months ; one head consistently preferred smaller prey than the other , although over the years each consumed roughly the same total mass. // After decades of studying reptiles and influenced by Donald R. Griffin , Burghardt recently has raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private experiences of animals , and what role does an inner perceptual world play in their lives ? Griffin , best known for discovering echolocation in bats , argued that mental events such as consciousness and awareness are indicated by surprising yet effective solutions to changing , unforeseen , and uncommon problems . In this regard the observations on snakes are inconclusive yet provide contrasting , tantalizing insights . IM 's two heads seemed ludicrously irrational , with no reduction of conflict in the face of their common need to provision the same body ! Hog-nosed snakes , however , meet Griffin 's criteria rather well : they behave as if aware of their deceptive and dangerous relation to the predator  --  as if they rapidly , consciously assess the dynamic and alternative roles of bluffing , death-feigning , and escape . // But does a mere serpent have reflections and intentions ? Can one dare speak of the mind of a snake ? Burghardt advocates critical anthropomorphism , combining empirical natural history with our perceptions , intuition , and feelings to predict the outcomes of experiments and comparisons  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel , ultimately testable hypotheses about the inner worlds of animals . His approach steers clear of uncritical caricatures of other creatures as little more than poorly formed humans ; in the spirit of " nothing ventured , nothing gained , " it also rejects strict but stifling objectivism . Perhaps snakes hold special promise for answering ethology 's fifth question , because they challenge us to go beyond the language and nonverbal gestures with which we readily identify mental events in fellow humans .
