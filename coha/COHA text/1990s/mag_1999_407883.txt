I dialed the airline as my 10-year-old son Devin was preparing his school lunch . " Last week I made reservations for 3 and I would like to alter the arrangements I made for an airport wheelchair for my husband . We 'll be needing 2 wheelchairs . " I had to make this change because a few days earlier an MS exacerbation left me unable to walk more than a few feet at a time . I had never used an assistive device , but my husband does . Jeff is a polio survivor who walks with a crutch and has the fatigue and diminished function of post-polio syndrome . I hung up the phone . Devin looked over from slipping his lunch into his backpack . I avoided his eyes . I felt terrible when I envisioned our family at the airport , with both parents in wheelchairs and our little boy burdened with luggage . Suddenly I was ashamed of myself . As a child I was infuriated when adults had " grown-up " conversations , as though I were n't present . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd caught myself . I explained to Devin what was going on-that I was having an exacerbation . I assured him that it would pass . As I took a logical look at what I had been doing , I realized that the suitcase was a light load for Devin compared to the emotional baggage I had almost heaped on him by not communicating directly and honestly . Sharing the good stuff and the bad stuff Open communication between parents and children means finding ways to talk about negative or worrisome issues , as well as the positive things . Many parents have discovered that the best policy is to discuss the MS problems in an appropriate way , on the spot . " Children can sense when something is wrong even when nothing is said , and they often imagine it to be far worse than the reality , " said Yvette Russell , PhD . Dr. Russell is a first-grade teacher , a rehabilitation counselor , and the single mother of Travis , age 3 , and Becky , age 6 . She is also the Society 's 1998 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-help group for teenagers at the National MS Society 's Wisconsin Chapter . " The kids were angry when their parents spoke about MS in hushed tones as though they could n't understand , " Dr. Russell said . " The parents thought they were sparing their kids , but they were scaring them . " Dr. Russell finds that when parents do n't exclude their children from their concerns , and are able to talk about MS using ageappropriate explanations , children are invariably more cooperative . They feel they have permission to ask questions and to grieve their parents ' losses . I 've found talking about MS with Devin works best on a " seize the moment " basis . Something may come up in the car , at bedtime , while taking time out from a game , anytime . Do n't let it pass . Give some basic information about MS , keeping it brief . When children ask questions , be sure not to overload them with more information than they 've requested . When families do n't talk When Shari Gerhart was growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chronic illness . It was never discussed and she formed the impression that it was somehow her fault . Shari 's childhood memories are clouded by guilt , sadness , and suicidal feelings . Both Shari and her husband John have MS and are raising their 10-year-old daughter Kathryn . The Gerharts encourage family communication , even though they ca n't always offer the positive responses they wish they could . // <p>                     @x Knights ! Form ranks , " ordered the Abbess Sharhava . " We ride . " The imperious , pale-skinned woman in the light blue-and-white habit ignored her pain as she sat erect on her mount 's back . She raised her bandaged right hand to the sky , then pointed down the trail . The ancient and long-abandoned castle of the kingdom of Orontae lay behind them . Ahead lay the ruins of a beautiful river valley . <p> <p> Tildi Summerbee slumped on Rin 's black-and-white-striped back . She scarcely sensed the bump as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor did she feel the cold wind whistling past them down the mountain . The smallfolk girl did not look back over the file of riders at the gaping wide doors of the once-grand entrance . The remains of stone giants that had only hours before tried to kill them had vanished with Edynn . <p> <p> Her entire attention was fixed upon the bundle in her lap , a bundle nearly the size of herself . The Great Book was hers  --  no , not hers to keep , but hers to protect and see secured against all harm . <p> <p> Around her , the Knights of the Word , the so-called Scholardom , rode in a square . They were not there to protect her so much as they intended to prevent her escape . Occasionally , they glanced at her sidelong , as though they found it hard to believe that one such as she , who was no larger than a child of their kind , with large brown eyes , and collar-length brown hair grown shaggy and rough along the trail , could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded . And yet , she was . As a smallfolk girl growing up in the Quarters , in the province of Ivirenn , she had known nothing of these solemn men and women who wore armor under their blue-and-white habits , and possessed both weapons and the skills to wield them . In the last few hours she had spent in their company , she learned they were an ancient order whose purpose was to possess and protect the Great Book , whereas she , an apprentice wizard at the beginning of her training , was the only living person in all of Alada who could touch the substance of the book . Anyone else who tried was burned horribly or killed . <p> <p> The book was too real for them , more real than anything else in the world , for it contained the world . The runes drawn in gold upon its pure white pages described everything , living and nonliving , that existed , changing as they changed , vanishing as they ceased to be . The runes moved of their own accord , growing larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes when she tried to draw attention to them . <p> <p> Within the sphere of the book 's influence , a radius of many yards , those same runes that described everyone and everything appeared upon that which they described . Tildi looked down upon her own rune , a complicated glyph that glowed upon her chest like a burning brand . It seemed right side up no matter from what angle she looked at it . She had become used to seeing it , but the wonder that it existed at all still sent a thrill up her spine . These runes were not mere labels ; they truly described what they marked . If these runes were interfered with , they could change the shape of the thing or , terrifyingly , the person . At the rear of the file of riders , unarmed and under heavy guard , rode two soldiers who served King Halcot of Rabantae . Captain Teryn was all right , a fair-haired human woman of middle years , but Morag , her sergeant and contemporary in age , had been terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he who lay dead in the castle behind them . Morag looked like a wild boar in human form , with an underthrust jaw and snaggled teeth , and thick , coarse black hair that never seemed to lie neatly no matter how long or short it was . He usually went with his head bent so no one could get a good look at his face . His hands were more difficult to conceal : thick paws with misshapen fingers . Everything he did seemed difficult . He persevered , though it surely cost him pain . <p> <p> Tildi 's life had been utterly changed . A few hours before , she was a wizard 's apprentice , barely trained in the basics of her craft over the course of mere weeks by two masters . Now , though she possessed the most powerful object in the whole of the world of Alada , she was a prisoner in all but name . They had tied a rope around her waist . The other end of the cord was held firmly in the hand of the knight who rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can safely touch you without sustaining injury , " the abbess had said , sounding sweetly reasonable as two gigantic human males in armor had descended upon her , " we must have some means of saving you if you should fall or be carried off by some foe . " <p> <p> Tildi felt the rough sisal chafe at her skin through her clothes , but did n't dare to put it off . The Scholardom had seen her use magic to climb the air like a ladder . They were taking no chances that the object of their desire should take itself out of their reach in that fashion . She was not robust enough to take any of these gigantic humans on physically . Later , she promised the book . Later , she and her friends would find a way to free themselves and find a way to safety . More than anything , she wanted the book to be safe . Faintly , she felt that she should be frightened for herself , but her feelings were dimmed and removed from her as though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass ! " <p> <p> The wizardess Serafina pushed her way in between two of the knights . Her dark eyes flashed with anger . The knights regarded her with suspicion , but they did not challenge her . The abbess Sharhava must have instructed them not to interfere with any of Tildi 's friends who wished to speak with her , so long as they did not try to remove her from the protective circle . The book must not be harmed . <p> <p> Tildi glanced up at her . Her long dark hair was spread out over the shoulders of the moss-green cloak she wore over her white wizard 's robe . She looked as neat as if she had just stepped out of a boudoir rather than in the aftermath of a few hours of a magicians ' battle and many days hard travel . Tildi felt like a rag doll in comparison . <p> <p> " Are you all right ? " Serafina asked , her voice carefully even . <p> <p> " I think so , " Tildi said . <p> <p> The young wizardess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Tildi breathed in a hiss of sympathy . Serafina 's golden skin reddened and puffed as if blistered by the brief contact . The wizardess touched the irritated digits with her other hand , and the color returned to normal . <p> <p> " It 's nothing to be concerned with , " she assured the smallfolk girl . <p> <p> " I do n't want you hurt , " Tildi said . <p> <p> " Do n't worry about me . " Serafina said hastily . Their exchange had two meanings , as well Tildi knew . Tildi envied her easy skill of healing the body . Neither she nor Serafina had the means to heal their hearts . Serafina had lost her mother , Edynn , and had become the de facto head of their party  --  if one did not take into consideration the mistress of the company of armed scholars surrounding them . None of them had had the chance to work through the many changes and sorrows they had suffered in only a few hours . Tildi knew , as though she could read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened , and overwhelmed . She regretted that she might be the cause of any of Serafina 's pain , but she could not help it . Things were happening to her , rather than by her own effort . All of them were caught up in a fierce tide of fate . Who knew where it would cast them ashore ? <p> <p> " We must do something to balance the power flowing through you . Rin , are you in any discomfort ? " <p> <p> " I will bear it , " the centaur said , shaking her head until the jeweled ribbons in her thick hair were a colorful blur . " Your spell gives me some protection , and I am acquiring a tolerance . Not as great as the little one , here , but enough . I am a Windmane , and we do not shrink from a challenge . I will carry Tildi and her new treasure as far and as long as she needs me . " <p> <p> Serafina turned her worried gaze back to the smallfolk girl . Tildi was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world in a way that she never thought possible  --  but her awareness came with a sense of distance , as if she only lightly touched the surface of it . The book occupied too much of her mind at the moment . The voices coming from it enthralled her . She wanted to pay attention to what was going on around her , but they were so interesting ... <p> <p> " Hold fast , Tildi , " Serafina said , laying a hand on her shoulder . The touch brought the smallfolk girl back from the inner world to which she was succumbing . " And do not do any magic . I am concerned you would have too much of a result , rather than too little . Do you understand me ? " <p> <p> Tildi pulled herself together enough to smile up at the young wizardess . <p> <p> " I wo n't . " <p> <p> Serafina nodded sharply and fell in alongside Rin . <p> <p> Tildi felt grateful to her . The wound they both carried in their hearts at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was so fresh that neither could speak of it yet . Tildi wanted to take the girl 's hand and let her pour out her sorrow , but she dared not . Serafina might feel that her sympathy was n't genuine , though it was . Edynn had been so kind to her , a runaway from her homeland , orphaned by the winged demons called thraiks . Serafina had carried the knowledge for years that the day would come when her mother was taken from her , and when the prophecy had come to pass Edynn had made her choice , and it had saved all their lives . <p> <p> The threat of thraiks , however , still hung over them . The way that they had taken to reach the castle had been largely underground , but that road was closed off now for good . Tildi scanned the overcast skies . No shapes were silhouetted against the clouds , but they could appear at any moment . She feared them more than any other nightmare . They had killed the rest of her family . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The voice belonged to Lakanta . The blond-braided trader clung to the back of her stout little horse in the file ahead of Tildi and Rin . As one of the imperious guards glanced down at her , the dwarf woman gave him a cheeky grin . He raised a hand as if he might deal her a blow , then turned hastily away . His expression of mixed horror and disgust made Tildi shiver . The knights hated her  --  indeed , all of them  --  for what they were . The abbess had assured her that they did n't , but she could read it in their runes . The book in her arms was the work of the great magicians of old , the Shining Ones , human beings who had brought into existence the sentient peoples known as dwarves , centaurs , merfolk , werewolves , bearkin , smallfolk , and perhaps more of whom she had not yet heard . Tildi shook her head . All her folk had believed for centuries that they had come about naturally , engendered by time and nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of months before , that only humans and elves were of normal origin , had been long forgotten . Perhaps the elders in the Quarters knew , but kept the terrible knowledge to themselves . They disapproved of all things magical . They would see Tildi as eternally disgraced for her participation in that anathema . <p> <p> " I ask you again to turn back and postpone this journey , " Serafina said , spurring her steed forward to confront the abbess . " Allow us to return to shelter until others of my order can come to augment us . Night comes soon . We are in danger . You did not hear the warning Nemeth gave us before he died . Others seek to possess the Great Book , others who have great power . I am not strong enough to protect a group of this size . " <p> <p> Sharhava did not rein back her horse . She leveled an authoritative eye upon the young woman . " I have told you , I have nothing more to say on this subject . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chapter house is much closer than any of your other safe havens . The sooner we reach it , the better . We must go quickly . The book and its guardian "  --  she aimed her gaze at Tildi  --  " must be protected . " <p> <p> " I tell you again , " Serafina said , narrowly containing her fury , " you do not understand the book 's powers . You will cause harm to yourselves , to everyone around you , if you do not take greater precautions than you are . " <p> <p> Sharhava did not seek to bridle her own anger . <p> <p> " Do not lecture me ! I know more of it than you do . Our order has studied ancient records and scraps of copies for millennia . The book is sacred to nature . We are ready to take on its stewardship ... until it reaches its final destination . " <p> <p> Serafina 's shoulders stiffened . She let her horse drop back , and was permitted to ride alongside Rin within the guarded circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that she was beaten for the moment . <p> <p> " It sounds to me like you are just finding excuses for doing everything wrong , " Lakanta said . <p> <p> Sharhava rounded upon her , sea-blue eyes glowing . <p> <p> " Silence ! " <p> <p> " You might as well ask my horse not to eat oats , " the stocky merchant said , imperturbably . " I talk . It 's something I do . When you are on the road as long and as often as I am , you exercise your voice , or it tends not to work when you get where you are going , and for a trader , that 's as good as losing money . If I say what I think a bit more than you 're comfortable hearing , then do n't listen ! " <p> <p> Rin let out a snort of laughter . Sharhava 's fair skin reddened . <p> <p> " You forget yourself . " <p> <p> " No , highborn lady , it 's you who 's forgetting what just happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  Lakanta aimed her chin at Magpie , who was listening openly with every evidence of delight  --  " suffered a terrible hurt . That madman back there turned him into a monster  --  no offense to you , Morag  --  and little Tildi there turned him back again . Then you pop up through the floor like a mole burrowing into a greensward and say , just as boldly as you please , ' You risked your lives for that book , but give it to me anyhow . ' The wonder is that you have the squeak to act so fearlessly about it when it bit you hard . " <p> <p> Only Lakanta was daring enough to speak openly of what had happened . Tildi saw astonishment written upon all of the knights , though none of her friends were surprised . <p> <p> Nemeth had lain dead in the smoke-filled chamber only minutes when the knights forced their way in and surrounded them all . <p> <p> Fire seared her memory . In her mind 's eye , Tildi saw the flames again , the blazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and her companions . He had made lightning and handfuls of flame like blazing coals that he had flung at them . Tildi felt her skin sear as she dared to jump through the blaze to reach the book . She had wrapped her small self around it to protect it . Once she had touched it , all the pain was worthwhile . She could do wonders with it near her . On the stone floor , Magpie had lain , perverted in shape like poor Morag . Then the scholar-knights had burst into the chamber , demanding to know what was going on . <p> <p> Tildi was still coming to terms with the wonders of the magic of which she was now capable . To her own astonishment and the awe of the others , she restored Magpie to his normal appearance from the freakish caricature of humanity into which the mad wizard had rendered him . Tildi still could not believe that he had retained that little scrap of parchment with his rune that she had drawn for him back in Master Wizard Olen 's home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . She was relieved to be able to have helped him . Not only was he a kind man , but a very good-looking one , with his curious yellow-green eyes , his tawny skin , and his long dark hair streaked with russet and white . She was torn between wanting to look at the book and wanting to reassure herself that she had not made any mistakes , that Magpie was going to be all right . <p> <p> Serafina left her to tend to the others who had sustained wounds in the fight , but returned immediately to her side when the abbess came to loom over her . Tildi had traveled with humans , and lived in Olen 's company . All those people treated her with respect , even kindness . Sharhava was a different and most compelling figure . She seemed larger than all the other humans as she towered over Tildi . The smallfolk girl saw greed and excitement in her as well as anticipation of triumph . The combination was so overwhelming that she cowered . How could she , so small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book ! " Sharhava exclaimed , her voice trembling with emotion . " Give it to me , girl ! " <p> <p> Tildi closed her arms more tightly around the scroll . The voices coming from it whispered , almost drowning out all other noises . The room was cramped now , filled with enormous humans in blue and white , all looking down upon her with avid , hungry faces . She felt overwhelmed . Every word had the force of a stone thrown at her . <p> <p> " Give me the book ! " Sharhava had commanded , her voice rising to shrill tones . <p> <p> Rin immediately leaped between the abbess and the smallfolk girl . <p> <p> " Leave her be , " the centaur said , flaring her nostrils . <p> <p> Impatient of every wasted moment , Sharhava attempted to outmaneuver the centaur , but Rin had twice as many feet to put in her way . Sharhava glared over the striped back at Tildi . " Give it to me ! Now ! You have no right to touch it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's an abomination , " Rin said , calmly matching her movements until the abbess was red-faced with fury . " If that is the thing that you believe gives your kind sway over mine . " <p> <p> " That 's not its purpose at all , " Serafina said , trying to defuse the rising feelings . " Rin , the Great Book is an invention of the same people who formed the centaurs . It is but another tool of their devising . No one owns you but yourselves . " <p> <p> " As long as she understands it is no certificate of ownership , " Rin snorted . " You may outnumber us , but that gives you no right to make demands . " <p> <p> The abbess looked from one to another as if amazed at their protests . " My order has sought this tome for thousands of years . You can not expect us to wait a heartbeat more when it is before us ! " <p> <p> The Rabantavian soldiers flanked the centaur . Captain Teryn laid her hand upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morag held his polearm firmly in both hands . <p> <p> " It was our mission to secure this book , " Teryn said . " My orders are to escort it and these honorables to the proper place for its bestowal . " <p> <p> " Our sacred duty overtakes your mission ! " Sharhava shrieked . She held up a hand . " Knights ! To me ! " The Scholardom became a wall of blue and white , surrounding Tildi . She bent over the book , as if to protect it from the sight . <p> <p> " We have done battle , " Rin said , snatching her whip from her saddlebag , to which she had just restored it . She wound it around and around her arm . The tassled end was still shiny with blood . " I still have fight in me . Have you enough strength left to withstand me ? " <p> <p> Sharhava let out a trill of laughter . " So few against so many of us ? " she asked . <p> <p> " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your kind ! " <p> <p> " And she does n't stand alone , " Lakanta said , ducking under Rin 's front legs to face Sharhava , though she had to tilt her head far back to do it . Her blond braids were askew , her clothes were burned and torn , and soot stained her fair cheeks , but she bore a hefty rock in one hand . She beckoned with the other . " You 'll come through me as well . " <p> <p> " Your challenge amuses me , " Sharhava said , holding her head high . <p> <p> " Stop all this ! " Magpie said , moving in between them . He was still somewhat unsteady on his feet . His tunic and trousers , travel-worn , were torn and burned , and his tricolored hair remained askew . The small lady with blue-green eyes started toward him to offer her support , but was urged back to her place by a brief glare from the abbess . " You would harm them after coming to their aid ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book that we came ! " Sharhava 's lieutenant Loisan exclaimed . " You can not care for it as we can . " <p> <p> " You ca n't take it from Tildi , " Magpie said . " She is the chosen representative of the Council of Elders led by Master Wizard Olen . " <p> <p> " Do not presume to dictate to me ! " <p> <p> " You can not take the book , " Lakanta said . " You forget that Tildi is not alone . " <p> <p> " You see that we outnumber you greatly , " the abbess said , unimpressed . " You may kill or disable some of us , but we are seasoned warriors , trained over the centuries for the sole purpose of protecting that book . " She pointed to the scroll in Tildi 's lap . " Give it to us . It is ours by right . " <p> <p> Rin unrolled the whip at her side and tapped it speculatively in her palms . " It is only yours because you say it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of the council that sent us . Take it if you dare . " <p> <p> Sharhava glared at the Windmane , and signed to the knights . They all drew their swords and advanced upon the company . <p> <p> " Be reasonable , Lady Sharhava , " Magpie said . He sought to put a hand on her arm , but she threw it off . <p> <p> " Do not touch me , you vagabond ! " <p> <p> The sudden movement made Magpie take a step backward . He staggered . The uniformed girl hurried to support him . Sharhava 's eyes went wide with indignation . " Lar Inbecca ! Come away from him . Rejoin your companions . " <p> <p> The girl started . " But , Aunt . " <p> <p> Sharhava 's eyes blazed . " Are you sworn to me , or are you not ? Do your vows mean nothing to you ? Get in line ! " <p> <p> The young woman , whose pale skin and chestnut hair marked her as a close relative of the imperious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> She took her place in the ranks at the rear of the file . She was a princess , Tildi knew , but how she had come to be among the knights , she did not yet know . So much had gone on around her in the last hours . She had absorbed little but the wonder of holding the object of her search at last . It was dear to her . <p> <p> " Please ! " Serafina protested . Her voice sounded thin and hoarse . She pressed her way through the crowd to the center , confronting Magpie and the indignant Sharhava . " We have all been through so much . There is no need for fighting . " <p> <p> " No , there is not , " the abbess said . " Our claim is clear . Our order was founded to take special care of this book once it was found . We are under no obligation to respect your so-called mission . You take more upon yourself than you should . You are too young to know a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " She should not have attempted to tease that dog . " <p> <p> Serafina , tired as she was , straightened until her back was as erect as a poplar tree and fixed Sharhava with a baleful look . <p> <p> " You want the book ? " she asked . " Then , take it . " <p> <p> " No , Serafina ! " Tildi protested . <p> <p> Serafina pushed in between the two groups . " No ! If you want it , Abbess , take it . Tildi , let her have it . " <p> <p> " But ... " <p> <p> " I am your teacher now . Listen to me . " <p> <p> Tildi gawked at her . <p> <p> " Serafina ! " <p> <p> " Go on , child . " There was a smoldering fire in her eyes . Tildi did n't understand the changes in her rune , but she did not choose to question it . " Give it to her . " <p> <p> The voices protested mightily , but Tildi lifted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could scarcely bear to watch it being taken away . In moments , it had become as dear to her as a friend . What would Master Olen say ? What would Edynn have said ? <p> <p> The abbess , triumphant , lunged for the big scroll . <p> <p> " At last , at last ! " she crowed . " Brothers and sisters , behold ! All these years ... aaaggh ! " She screamed and sprang backward . The scroll fell from her hands . Tildi dove for it . <p> <p> The smell of burning flesh took them all by surprise . Tildi felt the acrid scent singe her nostrils as she gathered the book back into her lap . It had unwound partway and nearly bounced out of her hands . Miraculously , she had managed to save it before it touched the ground . She rerolled the long parchment and patted it back into place on the spindle , cooing to it to soothe it from the indignity . Only then did she look up at the others . <p> <p> Sharhava had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and stared at them . In an instant they had burned to blackened claws . Her eyes were filled with tears as she glared at Serafina . <p> <p> " You cast a spell upon it , sorceress ! " <p> <p> " Of course I have not , " Serafina said . She handed her staff to Rin and knelt beside the abbess . She took Sharhava 's left hand between hers and bathed it in a ball of cool light . " It is the book 's nature that puts it out of the reach of ordinary beings . " <p> <p> Slowly , the hand returned to its ordinary color and shape . Serafina reached for the other one . <p> <p> In that brief interval , Sharhava had recovered her dignity . <p> <p> " Do n't touch me , sorceress ! " Sharhava thrust her away . " Take her ! " Two knights grasped her by the arms and dragged her upright . <p> <p> " Let me go ! " Serafina protested . Four knights rushed to assist the abbess to stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered . A huge , burly man with a knobbly face like a rockfall stalked to Tildi and attempted to lift the scroll . He only touched the spindle with one hand , then jumped back as if a snake had bitten him . <p> <p> " Black sorcery ! " he exclaimed , holding his scorched and reddened hand up for the others to see . He tried again . Tildi had to admire his strength of will , though it was fruitless . He could never close his fingers around the parchment . His hand seemed to stop by itself an inch or more from its surface . The voices in her mind grew agitated every time he tried . <p> <p> " You are hurting it ! " Tildi protested . <p> <p> " Never for the world ! " the man said , but he withdrew at last . He shook his head at the abbess . <p> <p> Trembling with rage and pain , Sharhava thrust her face at Serafina . <p> <p> " You have put a spell on the Great Book , " Sharhava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare !

" the abbess asked , almost accusingly . <p> <p> Serafina knelt beside Tildi . " Her immunity is the result of a chain of events that no one among you would ever want to duplicate . Not I or any of my order can do what she does . Only she can return the book to its place of safety . " She looked at Sharhava 's still-blackened right hand . " Let me help you , Abbess . I can heal that as well . " <p> <p> " Do not touch me again ! " Sharhava hissed . " I do not need aid from such as you . " <p> <p> The words were delivered like a whiplash of hatred .

" Sharhava asked suddenly . <p> <p> " Are you threatening her ? " Magpie asked , aghast . " A child ? " <p> <p> Sharhava stilled . A moment passed and her face changed . " Of course I do not threaten her . I merely ask for clarification as to the limits of the power she bears . All our fears that the Great Book would fall into enemy hands are groundless . But to see a mere infant in possession of the most important tome of this or any age ? How can this be ? " <p> <p> " She is not an infant , " Serafina said . " She is a smallfolk . You see her feet ? " <p> <p> Tildi felt keenly embarrassed as everyone in the room looked at her feet , still bare and filthy with soot . She curled her legs up underneath the big scroll to hide them . It would have been a terrible breach of manners in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical appearance , especially a woman 's . <p> <p> The news of Tildi 's race seemed to come as a terrible shock to the knights . Sharhava 's face , too , had gone blank for a moment , and part of her rune seemed to manifest itself more strongly . She and her brethren did not like smallfolk , for whatever reason . Tildi was surprised and dismayed at the deep distaste that the knights manifested then sought to conceal . She knew , though . Her enhanced sight uncovered many secrets that she knew the owners wished to keep hidden . <p> <p> " So , she is one of the toeless ones , " Sharhava said , recovering magnificently . " My studies do not show them to possess unusual magical talents , especially ones as powerful as hers ! " <p> <p> " Her ability comes as the result of events I would hope can never be duplicated , " Serafina explained . " She has made greater sacrifices than all ... than most . " Her voice trembled . Tildi put out a hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingertips left burn marks on the girl 's gown . <p> <p> " Then , she will bear the Great Book for us , " the abbess said . " It will go back to our Scriptorium . Consider , Tildi , " she said , kneeling down . " My order has sought this book for many long centuries . We would be grateful for the chance to study it . You will have a place of honor among us as the one who will make it possible to elicit the greatest good from the book . You shall have a title and quarters befitting your status . " She reached to touch Tildi 's shoulder , but withdrew the shaking black claw that was her right hand . " Help us preserve the treasure of the age ! " <p> <p> " It has to go to the south , " Tildi said , trying to figure out what the difference in the rune meant . She was afraid of the woman . Sharhava made her think of some of the wives of the elders in her home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life through sheer willpower , though their husbands were the ones in authority , not they . As a motherless girl , Tildi had withstood many like her over the years , but she was tired  --  so tired . " It is the only way to make it safe . " <p> <p> " That is what your masters have told you , chi  --  smallfolk , " the abbess said , her blue-green eyes boring into Tildi 's . " How far is it to your destination ? " <p> <p> " I ... I do not know . " Tildi looked up at Serafina for support . The wizardess held out her staff and a map appeared upon the air . <p> <p> " Our destination lies a hundred miles from the north coast of Sheatovra , " Serafina said . " I may not be more specific than that . " <p> <p> " Why not ? " Sharhava said , beaming maternally upon them all . " We can be allies . Let us assist you , at least as far as the chapter house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your journey could take months . " <p> <p> " Months ! " Serafina exclaimed . <p> <p> Sharhava was quick to pick up on her dubious mien . <p> <p> " Yes , of course . You are not used to the road , are you ? Winter is coming . It will be slow going , and you will need to travel in stages . We are experts at foraging and making a camp secure against beasts and intruders at night . You can be safe in our hands . " <p> <p> Magpie frowned . " A moment ago you were ready to snatch the book out of their hands and leave them here . Why the sudden offer of aid ? " <p> <p> Sharhava turned her brilliant gaze upon him . " There is no need to mistrust me , my dear Eremilandur . You have said that there are powerful foes opposing this mission . " <p> <p> " You were among those foes , " Magpie pointed out . <p> <p> " But that was before we saw what powers the Great Book bestowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can we speak against its Word ? You shall travel to the south , with us as your guardians . We should go at once . " <p> <p> The young man 's green-gold eyes were alight with wariness . <p> <p> " I would prefer to await Olen and the rest of the council here , " Serafina said . " I can summon him . He is watching for signs . It is too dangerous to travel openly . Nemeth spoke of voices ... " <p> <p> " Voices ? What of that ? He was mad ; you said so yourself , " the abbess said , interrupting her impatiently . " Was the man not dismissed from your father 's service , Eremilandur ? For incompetence during the war with Rabantae ? " <p> <p> " My father 's reasons were an excuse , " Magpie said hoarsely . Clearly he did not want to discuss what he had told Tildi . None of them looked back at the sad bundle on the floor , where Nemeth 's body sprawled underneath Morag 's discarded cloak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard voices , and I believe him . " <p> <p> " We should leave here as soon as we can . You will see how unsafe it is to remain here any longer . This place is unstable . " <p> <p> " How ? " Magpie challenged her . " It has stood for a hundred centuries . " <p> <p> Sharhava shook her head , as if he were a foolish child . <p> <p> " Not with stone giants pounding upon its walls , nor a malign lightning storm striking bolts upon it , " she said , waving her good hand at the cracks in the high stone ceiling . " The monsters are dead , but the walls could collapse in upon us at any moment . The winds could return ! " <p> <p> " Now , that is a practical consideration , " Lakanta said , eyeing the stonework with the air of an expert . " But for that , we can find a nice cave or a village to shelter in for a while until Olen comes . " <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We saw only destruction on our way here . " <p> <p> " Nemeth 's spell , " Serafina said , looking pale . " He wiped them out . Can we return to the caverns ? " <p> <p> Lakanta looked shamefaced . " Well , now , I would n't count upon my kin for much . You know that we dwarves like our privacy . " <p> <p> " The dwarfhollows are closed to us now , are they not ? " Rin asked gently . <p> <p> " You know , I just ca n't ask them to let a lot of humans go tramping through , " Lakanta said , her cheeks red . Tildi saw how deeply embarrassed she was not to be able to offer them the hospitality of her kin , but the words to offer comfort just would n't come . It seemed all the strength in her body went to holding the book in her lap . <p> <p> " What would you have us do , Tildi ? " Sharhava asked , ignoring the others . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupting the voices . Tildi looked up at her dreamily . <p> <p> " Serafina is our leader . She will decide . " <p> <p> " But you are the one who carries the Great Book ! " <p> <p> Tildi shook her head . <p> <p> " You are all weary . Let me take this burden for you , " Sharhava said persuasively . " We will go now , before sunset , away from this place . We will make for our haven . There I can gather more of my knights . The Great Book shall have a mighty escort befitting its importance ! Come , now ! " She stood up . " We will make ready to ride at once . I will lead you to safety . " <p> <p> " Wait , " Serafina said . " Not so soon . Give me a few hours . I must try to make contact with Master Olen . I must tell him ... " <p> <p> " If we wait too long , it will be nightfall , " Sharhava said , overpowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety of any of your party in this building overnight , let alone for an extended wait . We can be traveling toward Olen . That makes more sense , does it not ? Come , " she said persuasively , putting her good arm around Serafina 's waist , " let me speak to you as I would to a daughter . " <p> <p> " Oh , come now ! " Magpie exclaimed . " This is a transformation so thorough that a butterfly that had just finished turning from a grub would be impressed with you . " <p> <p> " Eremi , do n't speak to my aunt that way ! " Inbecca protested , but she did not look straight at him . Tildi could tell that she was torn between believing him or Sharhava . Tildi could tell by her rune that she was wavering . Magpie and Princess-Knight Inbecca were looking and not looking at each other . Tildi saw volumes of meaning in the runes that adorned them , then looked away , ashamed to be able to read their feelings so readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepest thoughts . Now she could not help it . She longed for rest . None of this was really happening to her . Everything felt like it was happening in a distant haze . <p> <p> In the Great Book , she found the story of a girl named Tildi , who was just like herself . But it was all so unbelievable ! If she had read it at home , she would have put the book aside as a drunken tale . <p> <p> Home . She felt pangs for lost home , loved ones , safety , comforts . But the book made up for a lot of her loss . She hugged it to herself . Over her head , the argument went on . Sharhava put her hand , her good hand , on Serafina 's shoulder . <p> <p> " You need time to think and to heal . Let those of us with more experience take a hand . We will make ready to go . The sooner we leave , the more distance we can put behind us before dark . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , you may contact Olen and tell him where to find us . Loisan ! " <p> <p> The gray-haired knight presented himself at her side . " Yes , my lady ? " <p> <p> " Gather up the horses . We leave within the hour . " <p> <p> " Yes , Abbess . " <p> <p> And that was that , Tildi realized . Serafina , coping with her own grief and the exhaustion from healing so many wounds , had been overwhelmed by the abbess . In fact , she agreed with the imperious woman many more times than Tildi would have thought she might if she were not so tired . The others were also too tired or disheartened to put up much of an argument in reply . Sharhava was triumphant . Tildi saw it in her rune . She knew Serafina could see it , too . Sharhava was a masterful woman . <p> <p> Within less time than she would have believed , the horses were found and groomed , including Magpie 's Tessera , Serafina 's white mare , and Melune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be found in the castle , nor would any of them have trusted it , but Nemeth 's reconstruction of the ancient building appeared to have included the wellheads . A couple of volunteers from among Sharhava 's force tested it and found the water not only good but sweet . They filled bottles and canteens , and washed off the dust and blood of battle . <p> <p> The book spoke of all these things to Tildi , even when she could not see them . She found she could spin automatically to the page she wanted to see , though much of which she wished to know was on the few leaves surrounding the gaping wound where Nemeth had ripped pieces away . She touched the torn edges . It would take strength to tear the parchment . Although it was old , it was as sound as the day it had been made . Such a beautiful thing . She could not help but stroke it , even though the touch still sent fire racing through her fingertips . It did not burn as painfully as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on the floor where she had stopped after helping Magpie . The knights were careful to give her room . She sensed odd emotions from them , almost as if she could hear their thoughts . They were angry , in a way . She felt fierceness from them . They ... hated her , or so it seemed , but why ? She had never done any harm , and they were offering to help her accomplish her goal . She thought she understood all of it when she saw open envy on the face of one lanky young man . That was it : she could do what they could not . She could n't do anything about that , nor could she help their feelings . <p> <p> Her friends spoke to her now and again . She thought she replied to them , but so much seemed imaginary now that she was not certain if she had spoken or only thought about speaking . <p> <p> With no duties and no responsibilities at hand , Serafina had settled in one of the big white thrones where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tildi knew she had much to think about . So much had happened . So much . <p> <p> Then it had been time to go . Tildi had seen the impatience in the knights ' runes on the page of the Great Book . She did not need to look up to see how many of them stood around her , waiting for her to rise . She rolled the enormous scroll up and prepared to leave . Heat seemed to roll from her in waves . It was lessening every moment , but it still made the others step well back . They formed a double row that led to the hole in the floor . <p> <p> She had looked down through it , and her heart quailed . The stone blocks had been a graceful staircase , then Nemeth 's monstrous army lay scattered in heaps on the floor of the huge reception room far below . The knights had been pulling themselves up by means of rope ladders . Tildi did not like heights . If only the stairs were still there ! Only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two stairs still clung together upon the section of the arch that had held them aloft . The rune , though slightly damaged , was largely intact . If that was how those parts were made , then it stood to reason that the other steps would have had similar if not identical runes . <p> <p> At that moment Tildi had been certain she could see how the stairs ought to fit together all the way down . The voices coming from the book assured her that her vision was true . She put out a small hand . <p> <p> " Votaf , " she said . <p> <p> With a crash like a thousand bolts of lightning , the stones flew together . Tildi blinked . The stairs were complete . Well , nearly complete . Some pieces still lay in heaps on the floor below , but an entire flight did now stretch down from here to there . She gazed at it in astonishment , then looked at her hand . How had she done that ? What did votaf mean ? Where had the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying her curiously . The knights were positively agog . <p> <p> " Could you do that again ? " Serafina asked . <p> <p> " I do n't know how I did it this time , " Tildi admitted . <p> <p> " It was well done , no matter how , " Rin said , trotting down the flight ahead of them . <p> <p> " Aye , I agree , " Lakanta said , taking the tall steps sideways to accommodate her short legs . " I did n't like the idea of swinging down a rope like a spider , though I would have done it . " <p> <p> Tildi 's legs were shorter yet , but somehow she managed to get down without falling or dropping the precious scroll . <p> <p> Excerpted from A Forthcoming Wizard by Jody Lynn Nye .
