When O.J. Simpson reflects on his childhood in San Francisco , it is not the house on the hill he remembers most but the football field up the street . Simpson grew up in a low-income housing project , but he lived on the fields and in the gym of the public sports park nearby , honing the skills that would take him to the pro-football Hall of Fame . The well-maintained facility was home to leagues in virtually every sport . " For the gangs of those days , the rec center was the focus of activity , " Simpson recalls . " There was always room , and there were always opportunities . " <P> For legions of elite athletes like Simpson , California remains the land of upward mobility . The state has produced legions of homegrown sports stars ( sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner , high diver Greg Louganis , slugger Darryl Strawberry ) and has polished the skills of legions more who moved to California to train ( swimmer Janet Evans , decathlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee , volleyball player Karch Kiraly ) . From title-winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Mike Powell ) , from Olympic champion swimmers ( Matt Biondi ) to gold-medal skiers ( Bill Johnson ) , California is the American sports machine . Nearly 30% of the U.S. athletes at the 1988 Summer Olympics were native or transplanted Californians . They won 30 medals  --  32% of the U.S. total . <P> Some of the reasons for the dominance of California athletes are obvious . First is nearly ideal year-round weather ; in much of the state , the idea of a rain delay is a foreign concept . " It was just natural that we played sports anywhere , anytime , " says Cheryl Miller , a Los Angeles native who developed into one of the best women basketball players of all time and a 1984 Olympic gold medalist . " I certainly would n't have been the player I was if I grew up somewhere else . " <P> Then there is the state 's unparalleled sports infrastructure . California boasts some of the world 's best sporting mentors , among them UCLA volleyball coach Al Scates , Stanford University swimming coach Skip Kenney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center in Lake Arrowhead and gymnastics coach Don Peters of the Southern California Acrobatic Team in Huntington Beach . A vast network of facilities , leagues , coaches and clubs crisscrosses the state . <P> Add to those factors the leisure-time culture made possible by the state 's past prosperity . California has been a boom state for most of the past 30 years , but with their dedication to work , people brought a devotion to play . " Middle-class values about work have combined with an affluent attitude toward sport and leisure . And unlike in any other state , here it was possible , " says Peters , who has turned out 40 members of the U.S. women 's national volleyball team and 13 Olympians since 1963 . <P> More abstract  --  even spiritual  --  ingredients also help put California first . " This is still ' Land 's End , ' " says sociologist Harry Edwards , a professor at the University of California , Berkeley . " California continues to offer a sense of hope and opportunity that other parts of the country do not and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in few places are they as prized as in the Golden State . As author Herbert Gold observed , " This Dorado of escapees from elsewhere has produced a new race  --  the Californian . So much athletic grace is almost unnatural . "
