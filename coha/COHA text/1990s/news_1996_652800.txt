<p> SAMUEL BECKETT SPENT most of his adult life in Paris . Indeed , when he died on Dec. 22 , 1989 , the novelist , poet , playwright and Nobel laureate had not visited Dublin , his birthplace , in 21 years . Occasionally , he would reminisce about walking the Dublin mountains with his father . He once asked an Irish friend if Greene 's bookshop still stood on Clare Street . He never lost his taste for Irish whisky . But he felt no great yearning to return to his roots . For the relatively few Dubliners who knew his work , he was another home-grown writer who preferred somewhere else to Ireland . <p> Yet even before his death , a movement to reclaim Beckett for Ireland was stirring here . To mark the writer 's 80th birthday in 1986 , Eion O'Brien published " The Beckett Country , " a book of text and photographs identifying the Irish locations mentioned in Beckett 's works . Then , in 1991 , the Gate Theater of Dublin organized a three-week festival of Beckett 's stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Lincoln Center Festival ' 96 in New York , the Gate is once again presenting all 19 of Beckett 's stage plays . This festival within a festival opens tomorrow at the John Jay Theater with the landmark " Waiting for Godot . " <p> So is Beckett , who wrote many of his best-known plays in French and is buried beside his French wife , Suzanne , in a Paris cemetery , now to be remembered as an Irishman ? <p> Michael Colgan , the Gate 's high-voltage director , looked uncharacteristically uneasy . " A writer as great as Samuel Beckett belongs to the world , " he said , as if enunciating an article of faith . " But , yes , this is a sort of reclamation . I do n't want to sound jingoistic , but we 're putting on the plays with Dublin actors . We 're doing them as we understand he wanted them to be performed . And I think we 're perhaps redressing some imbalance . " <p> Mr. Colgan , 46 , said Beckett himself , shortly before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Dublin festival of his stage works . In 1991 , when the city 's turn at the rotating title of European Cultural Capital arrived , Mr. Colgan invited several Europeans to join the Irish directors in the Beckett series . <p> For the Lincoln Center festival , four of the nine directors are not Irish : Walter Asmus , from Germany ; Karel Reisz , from England ; Pierre Chabert , from France , and Antoni Libera , from Poland . In New York , " Godot , " " Happy Days , " " Endgame " and " Krapp 's Last Tape " will be performed separately ; the remaining plays  --  the shortest , " Breath , " is one minute  --  will be presented in sets of three . <p> The Gate has not been alone in promoting Beckett . Long viewed here as important but impenetrable , he now stands alongside Oscar Wilde , James Joyce , W. B. Yeats and George Bernard Shaw in the Irish Literature sections of Dublin bookshops . Trinity College , Dublin , where Beckett studied and taught , has named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the affluent Dublin suburb of Foxrock where Beckett was born and brought up , has been recognized as a building of historical interest . Perhaps one day there will be guided bus tours of " The Beckett Country . " <p> Yet for Mr. Colgan and many others participating in the Lincoln Center festival , Beckett 's most convincing link to Ireland is found quite simply in the language of his prose , poetry and plays . " Here was a Dublin man writing in our rhythms , " Mr. Colgan said . " When Beckett did his French plays in English , he was n't translating . He was rewriting in another language , in our language . If an English person had done the translations , we would not be interested . There is a difference in the way the Irish speak and the English speak . A Dubliner has the edge with a Beckett play just as a Londoner would be at an advantage with , say , a Pinter play . " <p> It can be no coincidence , then , that two of the best-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick Magee and Jack MacGowran  --  were Irish . True , it was an actress from the north of England , Billie Whitelaw , who worked most closely with Beckett in the 1970 's and 80 's . But today it is another Irishman , Barry McGovern , who has inherited the mantle of the Beckett actor . In the New York festival , Mr. McGovern will play Vladimir in " Waiting for Godot , " Clov in " Endgame " and Willie in " Happy Days . " <p> " Beckett had an old-fashioned South Dublin accent , " Mr. McGovern said , recalling his six meetings with the author in Paris between 1986 and 1989 . " I always felt the syntax and the language of his early plays were very Irish , very Dublin . " <p> In the view of David Kelly , a veteran actor who will appear next weekend in the one-man play , " Krapp 's Last Tape , " " Waiting for Godot " is particularly Irish , even though it was first written in French . " The whole fabric of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , it has to be performed with an Irish accent , a Protestant Dublin accent . " <p> Caroline FitzGerald , who will be directing Jane Brennan in " Not I , " was less sure . " The rhythms of speech are familiar to us , " she said . " But I do n't know if they are Irish or French rhythms . The point is that he was so universal . " <p> Still , to hear Ms. Brennan rehearsing " Not I , " in which only her mouth is visible to the audience , or to hear Mr. McGovern , Alan Stanford , Johnny Murphy and Stephen Brennan going over their lines in " Waiting for Godot " is to feel the Irishness of the language . <p> Mr. Reisz , the film and stage director who will direct Mr. McGovern and Rosaleen Linehan as Winnie in " Happy Days " on Friday and Saturday , calls this " the music " of Beckett 's writing . " The music of the text seems to work extraordinarily well with Irish voices , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time very funny . " <p> FUNNY ? BECKETT , THE TALL ascetic writer who is never seen smiling in photographs , was renowned for his acid wit , but his works are not exactly the stuff of belly laughs . His plays often evoke the emptiness and hopelessness of life , his characters seemingly caught in an existentialist nightmare . When there is humor , it is frequently the dark humor of the Theater of the Absurd . <p> In " Waiting for Godot , " standing on a country road beside a tree , Estragon ( " Gogo " ) and Vladimir ( " Didi " ) debate hanging themselves . Estragon , the lighter of the two , tells Vladimir to go first and Vladimir balks . Estragon grows impatient . <p> ESTRAGON : Gogo light  --  bough not break  --  Gogo dead . Didi heavy  --  bough break  --  Didi alone . Whereas  --  <p> VLADIMIR : I had n't thought of that . <p> ESTRAGON : If it hangs you , it 'll hang anything . <p> While academics have gone gray trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dublin 's actors and directors seem willing to accept the playwright 's view that it is what it is . <p> Mr. McGovern , who is now 47 , first saw " Waiting for Godot " when he was 12 and first played the part of the servant Lucky when he was 23 . " I never had the baggage of some people , that this is depressing , nihilistic , etc , " he recalled . " I thought it was very funny but very serious . Beckett described it as a tragicomedy . It was the only play he described . " <p> Ms. FitzGerald , whose own experience with Beckett 's plays dates back more than 30 years , said she is always amazed by the humanity of his works . " I do n't find them depressing to work on , " she said during a break in rehearsal of " Not I. " " We all find them inspirational because in the end it 's about the triumph of the human spirit . " Ms. Brennan , still slightly breathless after running through the one-woman play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about understanding every word . " <p> Mr. Reisz extracts the same message from " Happy Days , " where Winnie is buried first up to her waist and then up to her neck . " Winnie has no reason to be positive , yet it amuses and pleases Beckett that she remains completely herself , surrounded by her hairbrush , her music box , her bits , and she finds solace in re-rehearsing her life every day , " the director said . " There is something beautiful about seeing this woman wanting to survive against all odds . But she is a specific woman , not Woman . It is Winnie . " <p> For all of Beckett 's own refusal to explain his works , the temptation to analyze them remains irresistible . And , inevitably , this means trying to comprehend the writer 's own mysterious and elusive character . Mr. Colgan and Mr. McGovern , who met him as an old man , still seem to remember every word he uttered to them . But among those participating in the New York festival , Mr. Asmus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waiting for Godot , " is alone in having worked with Beckett . <p> " Beckett had a dark vision but a very humorous vision of the world , of human beings , " the 55-year-old director said . " He refused to compromise . He was trying to fight the chaos , the anarchic side of himself , like a volcano he was trying to keep down . You could feel the dark side , the underbelly , of him through instinct . But on the outside , there was humor , lightness , at times sarcasm . As a director , he was very precise , always knowing what he wanted , never giving explanations . " <p> As memories have it , he was also as terse as many of his characters . In her 1946 memoir , the art patron Peggy Guggenheim recalled asking Beckett what he intended to do about their passionate love affair in Paris in the late 1930 's . " Nothing , " he said . When he was asked years later whether he was English , he gave an Irishman 's reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met him for the last time , Beckett cheerfully pronounced himself " dead but not gone . " <p> Perhaps it is quite simple : Vladimir , Clov , Winnie and his other bizarre creations are all Beckett . At least Mr. Asmus has evidence to suggest that is how he may eventually be remembered in Ireland . " When we did the Beckett festival here in 1991 , " he recalled , " a Dubliner came up to me and said , ' Thank you , you have brought Godot back to us. ' "
