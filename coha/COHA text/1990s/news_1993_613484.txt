<p> Washington - When a patient visits Grady Memorial Hospital 's outpatient psychiatric clinic , at the corner of Pratt and Coca-Cola Place , he 'll be examined and treated for any physical ailment not by a psychiatrist , or even an M.D. , but by a nurse . <p> Sue McConnell is an advanced practice nurse , a nurse practitioner to be preci se , with advanced medical training so she can treat illnesses such as hypertension or diabetes that could complicate the patient 's care . <p> " We have between 50 and 60 nurse practitioners at Grady in our satellite clinics , " says Ms. McConnell , who has worked in several clinics since she went to work at the hospital in 1978 . " In the diabetes clinic , all our patients are seen by nurse practitioners . The medical clinic has five nurse practitioners with stable caseloads . " <p> Grady began using primary-care nurses more than a decade ago to cut costs . Now America wants to cut costs , and many health reform advocates view Grady 's strategy as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems : high prices and a shortage of primary-care physicians , particularly in rural areas and inner cities . <p> Ms. McConnell - whose patients are mostly black , indigent , inner- city residents - regularly diagnoses and treats such conditions as hypertension , high cholesterol , diabetes , infection , bronchitis and eye problems . <p> When she 's confronted with a patient suffering from dementia , she must determine whether the illness occurred independently or is a byproduct of thyroid disease or advanced syphilis . <p> Few patients complain when they discover their primary-care provider is a nurse . <p> " It would be very rare for a patient to say , I wo n't talk to you , I must talk with a doctor , " Ms. McConnell says . " Very quickly , they get the idea that this is a person who is going to be able to help them with their problem . " <p> The American Nursing Association estimates that 400,000 of the nation 's 2.1 million registered nurses already are delivering primary care , some for high-quality HMOs , which profit by keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one slogan goes , " your family doctor may be a nurse . " <p> In addition , more than 25,000 physician assistants , who can examine patients and recommend treatment , practice nationwide in virtually every health care setting and in every specialty , including surgery , according to the American Academy of Family Physicians . <p> Architects of the Clinton administration 's health reform care plan say they view these workers as a way to cut costs while expanding access to care . First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has emphasized the administration 's desire to expand the role of nurses under the new plan , which is scheduled for release in September . <p> " We have every indication from the president and Mrs. Clinton that there is much more that nurses could do than state regulations allow , " says Virginia Trotter Betts , president of the American Nurses Association . <p> " If they bring 37 million uninsured into the medical system , there will be too much work , for every group of providers , to let archaic regulations limit the scope of our practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for care ? <p> Doctors , however , disagree . <p> Dr. Daniel Johnson , a trustee for the American Medical Association , says " neither they nor anyone else should be able to practice medicine independent of supervision of a physician . The nurse simply does not have the education to do that . <p> " To compare the capabilities of a nurse who has four years education with someone who has 11 to 20 years of education simply does n't compute , " he says . " It 's not a question of turf - it 's a question of quality of care . " <p> Arthur Caplan , a medical ethicist at the University of Minnesota , disagrees . <p> " It 's politics and it 's turf , " says Mr. Caplan , who was a member of the White House health reform task force . " The only reason we 're not making better use of nurses ' medical expertise is pure political self- interest on the part of doctors . " <p> Battling doctors for turf is not new , and the problem is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiropractors , even psychologists have had to fight to establish themselves . <p> It 's a 120-year dispute <p> The origin of the nurses ' dispute stretches back to the 1870s , when trained nurses were rare and many of those who cared for the sick were lower-class women often drafted from prisons or almshouses . <p> Princeton University professor Paul Starr , in his Pulitzer Prize- winning history , " The Social Transformation of American Medicine , " wrote that the push to reform nursing began " not with doctors but among upper- class women . " <p> " Though some doctors approved of the ladies ' desire to establish a nurses training school , which would attract the wholesome daughters of the middle class , other medical men were opposed , " he wrote . " Plainly threatened by the prospect , they objected that educated nurses would not do as they were told - a remarkable comment on the status anxieties of 19th-century physicians . " <p> Ms. Betts of the nursing association says sexism plays a role in nurses ' dispute with doctors . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all physicians were men and all nurses were women . Today it 's not in vogue to be a sexist . They have to mask it as something else . " <p> Today 's reformers have gone over the doctors ' heads - to the White House , which is well-acquainted with their position . Dr. Starr , for example , is one of the leading architects of the White House health care reform plan . He also advised Mr. Clinton on health policy issues during his candidacy . <p> For the most part , the dispute over the role of nurses has played itself out in states , where local legislatures , often heavily influenced by the well-financed doctors ' lobby , regulate what all health professionals may do . Many states restrict reimbursement or limit what a nurse or physician 's assistant may do . <p> Strict rules in Georgia <p> In Georgia , the Nurse Practice Act gives the Board of Nursing the authority to set rules for advanced practice nurses . Those rules now require nurse practitioners to work under the supervision of a doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nurse practitioners at Grady Hospital 's satellite clinics have their own caseloads , so patients are not shunted from one care-giver to another , says Ms. McConnell . <p> They examine patients and may recommend treatment , but any prescription must be co-signed by a physician . A doctor is on duty during clinic hours to provide supervision and assistance in cases too complex for nurse practitioners to handle . <p> Unlike nurse practitioners in 22 states , nurse practitioners in Georgia may not independently prescribe drugs - although a Georgia doctor may delegate that responsibility . <p> Although no law requires insurance companies to reimburse nurse practitioners in Georgia , some companies do , according to a survey by Nurse Practitioner magazine . <p> What nurse practitioners would like to achieve through health care reform , says Ms. McConnell , are " clearer guidelines " on what ailments can be cost-effectively treated by nurse practitioners and what types of more severe problems should be referred to physicians - " so we have less overlap . " <p> Nurse practitioners say they can independently provide family planning services , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can diagnose and treat hypertension , high cholesterol and diabetes that can be controlled by diet , without insulin . <p> Relying heavily on nurse practitioners may solve one problem - providing care to the urban and rural poor - but it could create another . <p> Even nurses who support broadening their role in medical care acknowledge this could result in a two-tiered system of health care , with doctors treating patients who have money or insurance and with allied practitioners caring for the poor . <p> Dr. Ronald Bayer , a Columbia University medical ethicist , says such a system would be " inequitable - even if the quality of the care is the same . " <p> Dr. Bayer , who served on the White House health reform task force , said the Clinton administration 's plan to provide universal coverage would lessen the financial incentive to treat patients differently . <p> Some success stories <p> In many states , according to the nursing association , advanced practice nurses have successfully carved independent niches for themselves . In Tucson , Ariz. , nurse practitioners run 17 community health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fla. , five nurse practitioners treated infections , mended wounds and otherwise cared for 14,607 patients last year in a joint effort by two hospitals to care for indigent patients . In New Hampshire , nurse practitioners operate a primary-care van that goes from the Massachusetts to the Canadian borders . <p> Doctors ' misgivings come as no surprise , nurse practitioners say . Already , the two groups are competing for patients , and nurse practitioners charge about half of what a physician would for primary care , say about $ 60 for a physical . A doctor would charge $ 120 and up , depending on the location and other circumstances . <p> Salaries reflect the difference . A nurse practitioner at Grady earns up to about $ 45,000 . In private practice , the same person might get $ 80,000 . Physicians , about 70 percent of whom are specialists , typically earn about $ 100,000 , though quite a few earn considerably more . <p> Ms. Betts , the nursing association president , says doctors compete for a patient only until the patient 's insurance runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all patients will have health coverage , has radically tipped that balance , she says , and hardened physicians ' opposition to relinquishing some primary care to nurses . <p> " There 's no competition to care for people who ca n't pay or are disenfranchised , " she says . " This issue of competition only comes up when it 's likely that those people will be able to pay for services . <p> " If quality of care is such a big issue for physicians , " Ms. Betts says , " why , all over the South , are there doctors ' offices - I can take you to them - with big signs saying : ' We do n't take Medicaid patients ' ? <p> " They 're begging the question , " says Ms. Betts , who is from Tennessee . " If quality and access were the big issues , we would all be on the same side - we would all be trying to make health reform happen because it 's so important . "
