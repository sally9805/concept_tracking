This time , Carrie explores a different kind of justice . " Sous la Mer " is a beautiful and poetic tale about a woman , two men , and the sea . <p> THE LAST PLANGENT CHORD of " Adrift , " the last whisper of Suzanne 's voice , died away . She held the pose in the hush , head bent low over her guitar , her long , white-blonde hair concealing her face . With her diminutive size , her white dress , the snowy blanket over her lap , she looked like a statue of a child , hammered out of white gold , shining in the silvery pool of the single spotlight . <p> I peeked out from my vantage in the wing of the tiny stage and saw that a few of the audience were crying . Others looked stunned . Then first one , and another , began to clap , and soon the entire house was standing and applauding . It was only a small dinner-theater venue , several miles from Mobile 's fashionable harbor district , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . <p> She let it go on for a few minutes , pressing her hands together and bowing her thanks , rewarding her admirers with a shy smile . Then she spoke into the mike , " Thank you  --  thank you all so much for coming . Good night , and drive carefully . " <p> That was my cue . I stepped to her side , bowed my own acknowledgment to the audience , checked to make sure the blanket was tightly tucked around her stumps , and wheeled her offstage . Backstage , I held her guitar case while she put the instrument away , then navigated her wheelchair down the corridor and to the side door . <p> " I 'll bring the car around . Will you be okay here ? " I asked , taking the guitar case from her arms . <p> She nodded without speaking and pressed my hand . She looked tired . Singing was one of the few things that brought her joy in life , but the performances exhausted her . I wrapped my jacket around her shoulders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes later , a young man was kneeling beside the wheelchair and talking earnestly to Suzanne . The tired lines had vanished from her face ; she was smiling and her eyes sparkled as she introduced me . <p> " Allan , this is my brother Merlin . Merle , this is Allan Lee . " Allan stood and shook my hand with a grip as earnest as his manner . He looked to be about twenty years old ; tall , muscled , tanned , with the smell of the sea about him . He dwarfed tiny Suzanne and towered over my own slight frame . <p> " Pleased to meet you , Mr. D'Azora . I just wanted to tell your sister here how very much I enjoyed her singing . Her songs about the sea . . . they 're just so full of beauty , of longing . . . . " He laughed . " I ca n't express it the way you do , Ms. D'Azora  --  I just know I 've been privileged to hear you . " <p> There 's one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak heart-to-heart . Someone who is half in love with the sea already , before he hears her sing . Someone who hears " On the Shoals of My Heart , " " Stormsails , " " ' Round Cape Heartbreak , " or " Adrift , " songs of love and loss and the sea , always the sea  --  and whose life is never the same after the experience . <p> Allan Lee 's dedication radiated from puppy-dog eyes as he bent to take Suzanne 's hand . I spoke up : " My sister and I appreciate your kind remarks , Mr. Lee . Unfortunately , Suzanne is a little fatigued right now . I 'd better take her home . " <p> He stood aside with clear reluctance as I lifted Suzanne into the car , rearranged her blanket , folded the wheelchair , and placed it in the back seat . I went around to the driver 's door ; our eyes locked over the top of the car . My smile was stiff . " Good night , Mr. Lee . " <p> He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Suzanne waved farewell , then turned to me . " Merlin , you are such a spoilsport . " She mimed a pout , then giggled . <p> " Leave him alone , Suzanne . " I steered us home down the coast highway , directed by the cold , pointing stars . <p> Two weeks later Suzanne played at Boudreaux 's in Biloxi , late sets Friday and Saturday nights . Allan Lee sat in the back of the house both nights ; after Saturday 's performance he came backstage to bring her a white rose . <p> She smiled and pressed his hand , then exclaimed over her clumsiness in scratching his wrist with a thom . Allan protested that it was nothing . Without comment , I handed over my handkerchief for Suzanne to blot the tiny beads of blood . When Allan invited us both for drinks , I declined , pleading my driving responsibilities . After an awkward moment , Suzanne also made her apologies . Allan took note of my unspoken satisfaction , but I could tell by the set of his jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month later we were in Bay St. Louis , to provide afternoon entertainment during the annual Blessing of the Shrimp Fleet Festival . Allan took one of the scats in the first row of folding chairs and waved to Suzanne like an old friend as I wheeled her into place before the microphone . <p> After her set he insisted on giving us a guided tour of the piers . His father was a shrimper , he told us , and he delighted in pointing out and naming each freshly painted , flower-festooned , and holy-water-sprinkled boat . Flags and gay plastic streamers of all colors snapped in the breeze , and above our heads gray and white gulls laughed and tumbled as they snatched from midair the popcorn Suzanne threw to them  --  popcorn Allan had purchased for her . <p> I might as well have been invisible . Allan told her of his job feeding and training the performing stock at the Marine Life Oceanarium in Gulfport . He was especially fond of the dolphins , praising their quick intelligence and constant good humor . Bored and irritated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warmth of the sun , the smells of salt and pitch and fish guts , the rhythmic slap of waves against pilings . If I closed my eyes I could pretend that I walked on the back of some great live thing sunning itself and bobbing gently in the embrace of mother ocean . <p> The sight at the end of one of the side piers burst my reverie . A deep-sea fishing charter had just returned to port , and the triumphant client was posing for pictures beside his catch , a blacktip shark fully as tall as he was . The dead thing hung suspended on a huge hook through the tail muscle ; a black cloud of flies buzzed about its bloody maw where the teeth had been cut out for souvenirs . The fisherman swilled beer , loudly related his prey 's fierce struggle , and showed off a vicious scratch on his arm received while landing the frenzied shark . <p> I felt sick , and turned away . By the time I made my way back to Suzanne and Allan I had regained my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them . It was clear that Allan thought he had made a conquest . He squatted beside Suzanne 's wheelchair and helped her throw tidbits to the acrobatic gulls . <p> " Some of my friends go to USM  --  up in Hattiesburg , you know ? Anyway , I told them about you , how well you sing . They said the student entertainment committee is always looking for singers to perform on campus . Why do n't you give them a call ? My friends sure want to hear you . " <p> Suzanne shook her head . Pointing to the gulls overhead , she said , " Hattiesburg is too far for my friends . " She and I traded a private smile . From the comer of my eye I saw frustration flicker over Allan 's face . My smile grew wider . <p> Allan tried to recover lost ground with an invitation to dinner . I willed Suzanne to decline , but she accepted with delight . They flirted like schoolchildren throughout the meal , laughing and touching hands , matching each other glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wine . When I refused a refill after my first glass , Suzanne shot me an exasperated look , but I ignored it . My hard-drinking youth ended on a patch of moon-drenched highway , to the sound of Suzanne 's screams . These days I practice restraint . <p> At the end of the evening Allan lifted Suzanne out of her wheelchair and placed her in the car himself . For a moment she nestled her head against his chest . Hormones tingled in the air , and I wondered if they would drive off and leave me standing on the curb . <p> He did n't kiss her . Not yet . I beckoned him to join me at the rear bumper after Suzanne and he had said their farewells and he had shut the car door . He was flushed , prickly with the heat of his triumph , wary of my calm . <p> " Stay away from my sister , Allan . " There was a harsh edge to my voice , but I did n't care what he thought . <p> My lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he leaned over me . " You do n't control her , man ! I 'll see Suzanne if she wants me to  --  and she does . You ca n't stop us ! " <p> The young think all of life is a soap opera . I suppose if they live long enough they learn otherwise . I slammed the car door harder than was necessary , getting in . I love my sister dearly but sometimes I do n't like her very much . Suzanne and I did n't speak all the way home . <p> I HAD PREPARED a simple meal of ceviche and salad , accompanied by an elegant chardonnay , for dinner ; Suzanne and I ate on the terrace facing the sea as the sunset . The day had been clear and hot ; as the light faded a breeze began to blow in off the water , dropping the temperature to something more tolerable . While we dined a full moon rose like a bloody tear over the water . Down on the shore the waves beat slowly , in time to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . After so many years together our conversation had become largely non-verbal . An eyebrow lifted at the immensity of the rising moon , a silent nod at the silhouette of some late-soaring waterbird , a fond smile , spoke volumes . Suzanne seemed more relaxed than usual , thoughtful ; several times I caught her staring blankly out over the sea , humming something under her breath . When I cleared the table after supper she asked me to leave her the bottle of wine and to bring her guitar and music notebook out to her . <p> She played a few chords of the new song she was working on for me ; the title was " Sounding Sea . " I tried to read for a while , but the moonlight and the distant mutter of the surf made me restless . I put down the book and watched Suzanne , pencil gripped between her teeth , as she picked out a line of melody , frowned over it , repeated it with a slight variation , then grabbed the pencil and recorded it . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I think I 'll take a walk down the shore . Can I get you anything before I go ? " <p> She shook her head absently . After a moment she noticed I was still there and laughed . " Go on , take your walk , dear . I 'll be fine . I 've got everything I need to keep me busy for hours . " <p> I leaned over and kissed her hairline , right where the dark streak of her widow 's peak begins . My own pale locks have acquired a similar sprinkling of dark hairs as I 've grown older . Someday , when Suzanne and I are ancient , perhaps we will have raven tresses and be the envy of all our acquaintances . <p> Our little princedom by the sea . Suzanne and I had chosen this house precisely because , in defiance of tidal surge or hurricane , it sat so close to the water . And it was isolated ; my sister and I are private people . Now I picked my way across a hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world rolled to a stop at my feet . <p> The tide was coming in , bringing with it brown mats of seaweed , and , tangled in the vegetation , thousands of the jellyfish known as Portuguese men-of-war . The floats bobbed in the low swells , and as the waves retreated , the jellyfish were stranded on the sands . <p> The bright moonlight showed me vivid , electric blue gasbags , topped with sails of delicate pink . They ranged in size from the length of my thumb to that of a football , and the beach ahead of me was littered with their membranous bodies for as far as I could see . Tomorrow 's sun would heat the air trapped inside until the bags burst like balloons , leaving only a smear of bright blue on the sand . <p> I made my way south down the shore , avoiding the still-dangerous stinging tentacles of the jellyfish . Between waves I would step out onto the wet sand , looking for interesting shells or odd pieces of flotsam , but as each wave curled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get my shoes wet . Once I stepped on a jellyfish by mistake and the gasbag popped with a rush of sour , briny air . I fancied that I saw a movement in the tentacles then , but it must have been my imagination , or the wind . Jellyfish are incapable of feeling pain , or so scientists say . <p> I stopped on a sandy spit that curved out into the waters like the prow of a ship . The breeze had an iodiney nose that I have always found intoxicating and I quested it for news . Occasionally a sharper gust of wind peppered my cheeks and the backs of my hands with stinging grains of sand . The round moon hammered a molten path across the wavetops , inviting me , and the song of the surf pulled at me like an undertow . For a long time I stared out at the junction of sky and water . Not a single light  --  not a ship nor a navigation buoy nor a drilling platform  --  showed in the darkness . I knew that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  forever . <p> My love for Suzanne , and the loyalty and guilt that have kept me by her side ever since her accident , stopped me . I turned my steps back to the house . Back to Suzanne . <p> I heard them before I saw them : sighs that were not the wind , moans that were not waves upon the shore . I had been gone for several hours ; plenty of time for one to call the other , for an invitation to be issued and accepted , for passion to progress to foreplay , and beyond . <p> Allan had wheeled her chair down the ramp from the terrace into the sands , and spread her blanket next to it . I lingered in the shadows at the comer of the house and watched them . Suzanne was on top , her skin as white as wavefoam in the moonlight , her thighs gripping Allan 's hips , the rounded stumps of her legs , amputated just above the knee , digging into the blanket for purchase . <p> My groin tightened as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with their tiny aureoles and bullet-shaped , pink nipples ; the pale hollows inside her hipbones ; the froth of white hair between her legs ; the delicate , pink membranes beneath . <p> He whispered words to her that the wind tore away , but she was too far gone to hear him anyway . Her nails left strange script on his chest , and when she came , she arched her back and screamed like one of her beloved gulls . <p> Without pulling out of her , he turned her beneath him and began to move . Her hands closed on his buttocks and pulled him hard against her ; she came again just before he emptied himself into her . For a few moments she stroked him as he lay heavily atop her . When she reached into the pouch hanging from her wheelchair , I turned away . <p> Allah 's muffled scream brought me back . The handle of the knife stood out from his back like some strange coral encrustation . He writhed and tried to call out again , but Suzanne is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his cries were little more than squeaks and bloody gurgles . <p> Suzanne squirmed out from under him and leaned back against the wheel of her chair to watch his throes . The look on her face , even as often as I have seen it , chilled me . Reluctantly i left my vantage point and moved to stand beside her . She glared up at me . " You took your sweet time coming back , Merlin ! " <p> I hooked a hand under the unfortunate Allan 's shoulder and flipped him over . The impact drove the knife deeper into his back . He arched and tried to scream again ; a shiny red bubble , as large as an apple , burst over his lips . One hand scrabbled for purchase in the sand , the other plucked at the torturing splinter in his back . I felt sorry for him , but I have never been able to deny Suzanne anything . <p> I left him writhing there , with Suzanne to keep him company , while I went after the tools I needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious  --  when I took his legs . Alive , because the muscle and bone must be well-nourished and fresh ; conscious , because Suzanne likes it that way . My scalpels sheared effortlessly through skin and muscle just above the knees ; the battery-driven bone saw made quick work of the femurs . He fainted at one point , but I brought him around to watch as I pressed each bloody appendage home on Suzanne 's stumps . The grafts took with wet sucking sounds . <p> I helped Suzanne to her new feet . Allan 's sturdy , hairy legs looked absurd attached to her slim thighs , but they worked . Suzanne laughed at the horror and anguish on his face and skipped merrily away down the beach . For one night , until the borrowed legs withered and fell off at dawn , she was free . <p> I bent over Allan . " I told you to stay away from my sister . It was good advice . You should have taken it . " I kissed him gently on the forehead , and broke his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back , and started for the shore . Time enough tomorrow to clean up the evidence of his visit and make his car disappear . <p> On nights of the full moon a mer may take on human form and walk two-legged on the land . And on nights of the full moon a former mer , trapped in human flesh and exiled from the depths of home by staying human too long , may return to the sea . But if by misadventure a mer in human guise should lose her legs . . . . Well , how then to grow a tail ? <p> Suzanne and I had been young and curious , fearless and thrill-seeking . We had visited the land many times before the night of the accident , had grown careless in our love for drinking , dancing and gambling . The treasures of the deep seas can buy quite a lot of drink , dancing and gambling no questions asked . <p> Perhaps if I had not drunk so much that night , if my reactions had been faster to push her from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the middle of the midnight highway . . . . I could not leave her as she lay bleeding and screaming under the cat 's wheels ; or later , at the hospital , when they told me they would have to amputate her mangled legs  --  even though I felt moonset 's imminence in my marrow . <p> Suzanne woke from the surgery screaming , and screamed until she was sedated again . When she woke a second time she made no sound at all , not even to speak , for weeks . But when the therapists tried to fit her healed stumps with artificial limbs , she began to scream again , as though the touch of those plastic and steel obscenities scalded her flesh . After a time I persuaded them to stop trying . <p> And I stayed with her , all these years . Mother Ocean , I stayed . Suzanne was already frolicking in the waves when I strode up with the body . She had woven herself a girdle of men-of-war jellyfish ; the bright blue floats adorned her hips and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could hear the tiny snick , tic of stingers firing ineffectually against her silver scales . " Suzanne , dearest " I said fondly , " you are a monster . " <p> " Come on , you slowpoke ! " She laughed , and splashed me with her flukes . The longed-for , electric tingle swept over my skin as legs became tail , skin became scales and fins , gill-slits flared open . I dragged Allan 's body under with one webbed hand , kicked once , and felt the water cleave before me . Humans call it a dolphin kick . Bah ! I despise those goody-goody porpoises . Give me the noble fierceness of the sharks our brothers , who would take care of Allan 's body for us . Allan Lee , like others before him who had loved the treacherous sea too well , would disappear without a trace . <p> The water tasted of all the news of home , and we had hours yet before moonset . But I have learned , in my human years , to feel guilt . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Suzanne can no longer lure a human to her sacrifice ? My sister and I love with a love that is more than sibling affection . I have lain where Allan Lee lay , and taken my pleasure there . . . and felt my shoulder blades itch , even in the moment of my ecstacy , awaiting the stroke of my destiny . <p> But for now , tonight , I was going home . <p>  --  With apologies to Mr. E.
