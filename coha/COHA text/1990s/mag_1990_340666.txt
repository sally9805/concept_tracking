It has become an annual ritual on the tranquil lakes of northern Wisconsin . As the sun sets behind the dense pines that surround Lake Nokomis , tribal drumbeats signal the start of the Chippewa spearfishing season . While the Indians steer their boats into the calm , dark waters , angry protesters try to drown out the drums with air horns , whistles and taunting choruses of songs with such lyrics as " Where have all the walleye gone ? " <P> The scene , which was played out again last week , symbolizes a clash of cultures . At issue are 19th century treaties , recently upheld by the federal courts , that allow the Chippewa to spear spawning walleyed pike in the shallows of 178 northern Wisconsin lakes . Sport fishermen , who are required to use less efficient fishing rods and are limited to three to five fish a day , claim that the Chippewa are harming tourism by depleting the walleye population . " It 's 1% of the population exercising their rights to the detriment of 99% , " charges Dean Crist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little evidence that the walleye population is near extinction . According to the state department of natural resources , which sets the safe harvest level for fishing , sport anglers caught 670,000 walleyes last year , vs. only 16,000 speared by Chippewa fishermen . <P> Spearfishing was part of the Chippewa way of life long before white settlers arrived in Wisconsin . The Indians claim that the protests are motivated by racism . Says Tom Maulson , an activist with the Lac du Flambeau band : " No respect is given to Indian people . They have to stand up for their rights . " <P> After five years of confrontation that resulted in fistfights and hundreds of arrests , a compromise may be in sight . The Chippewa have lowered their spearing quotas , and the state is making plans for attracting more tourism to the region . But there is still a danger that hotheads will explode during the three-week spearfishing season . " There 's fear among people who do n't know one another and are suspicious that the other is getting something they are n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Lake Nokomis to observe and document events . " These are all people who love the north woods , but they are n't communicating . "
