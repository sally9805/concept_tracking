<p> ' NEVER has my flabber been more gasted , " spluttered Jeff Torrington on the night his first novel , " Swing Hammer Swing ! " received the highly coveted 1993 Book of the Year Whitbread Prize . He could also have been speaking about the reaction of much of the British literati . For Mr. Torrington , on the face of it , is a most unlikely man to be writing books , let alone scooping up a top literary award . <p> A Scotsman who grew up in the Gorbals , a now demolished section of Glasgow notorious for poverty , disease , and crime , he left school at 12 because of tuberculosis . But his stay in a TB sanatorium , by his own reckoning , was a blessing . The place had a comprehensive collection of the world 's classics ; young Torrington devoured the lot . When he left , at 14 , the standard age in those days for working-class Scottish lads to earn their keep , he embarked on a long career of odd jobs : whiskey-crate packer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the like . By his late 20s , he was married with three children to support . In between , however , he read . And wrote . <p> Inspired , in particular , by the works of existentialists such as Camus and Sartre , Torrington churned out a procession of short stories - only to have them rejected by editors . Then one day , a local newspaper bought a piece , for which he was paid three guineas ( $ 5 ) . But until his Whitbread Prize-winning novel ( available only in the British edition ) , the sum total of his earnings from writing came to barely British pounds1,000 ( $ 1,580 ) . <p> About the time of his first modest publishing success 30 years ago , Torrington began the novel British critics are hailing as a landmark in English fiction ; one aptly summed it up with : " Damon Runyon meets James Joyce . " <p> Set in the 1960s , the 407-page tome centers around a weekend in the life of Torrington 's alter ego , Tom Clay , a would-be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pawn his typewriter to make ends meet , while his wife is in the hospital awaiting the birth of their first child . <p> Torrington 's literary style is raw , ribald , and rambling . But the seemingly plotless tale - " life does n't bother itself with plots , " Torrington says - twists and turns , ducks and weaves , and what eventually emerges from the vagaries of verbiage is a gritty , graphic , decidedly idiosyncratic picture of life in a Scottish slum . <p> The author knows intimately what he 's talking about , and it shows . The ring of truth resounds throughout the text . This , plus the mix of hard-hitting imagery with a no-nonsense surety of inventive expression , gives a kind of vibrancy that is rare in novels today . <p> When Torrington , for example , writes of Clay , he does not have him mundanely walking but rather " skittering " down the " streets of Crabton a fictitious area in the Gorbals . " Equally , he describes the locality as " the kind of place you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural theme was anonymity and this had been so faithfully subscribed to that even though it 'd a graveyard bang at the heart of its main thoroughfare youve been hard pushed to locate it . " <p> Torrington 's work is suffused with humor - " gallows humor , " as he calls it in an interview . Indeed , one gets the sense that the author views humor as the wellspring of life . Without question , it is a key underlying theme of his book . The Gorbals was , as Torrington observes , a pretty grim place . A highly developed sense of humor became an essential tool for survival . In terms of simple exigencies , for instance , no one possessed a bathtub ; you used the sink or a large bucket or a public bath house for a wash . The toilet was outside , and typically shared with eight to 10 families . A kitchen - consisting of a small stove - was in the living room , which doubled at night as a bedroom . <p> Yet what replaced this unspeakable slum was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . When the Gorbals was gradually demolished - hence the book 's title , which refers to the builder 's wrecking ball - the long-standing tradition of extended families living in close proximity was also obliterated . People were rehoused willy-nilly . Grandparents , aunts and uncles , grown sons and daughters no longer lived across the street or around the corner ; once-strong family ties were stretched and broken . <p> What emerged in place of the Gorbal 's tenements were high-rise crackerjack boxes . Every family now had their own proper kitchen , bath , and toilet - albeit jerry-built . And it was not long before deterioration set in : The elevator on which everyone depended was inevitably one of the first things to go , resulting in the elderly and mothers with baby buggies having to either brave trudging up and down endless flights of stairs , or remain stranded in their urban eyries . <p> Today , dubbed " modern slums , " what replaced the Gorbals is now itself in the process of being demolished . " Swing Hammer Swing ! " is Torrington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but about also what happens when city planners try to solve problems through " enlightenment " on the cheap , rather than genuinely responding to real human needs . <p> That Torrington completed such a weighty work is all the more remarkable given that he has been ill during the past 10 years , diagnosed with Parkinson 's disease . Even speaking is difficult , which means that Margaret , his wife of nearly 35 years , is always nearby to translate . <p> " But Jeff still has a great sense of humor , " she remarks . " And his attitude toward his illness is that he will never let it overcome him . He 's always fighting it , so even on a poor day , he 'll set up his word processor and have a go . " And thank heavens for the word processor , she says , which he acquired fairly recently . " It means he does n't have to use so much Tippex correction fluid , " she notes , with a laugh . <p> OUTWARDLY Torrington 's life has changed little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confides , winning the Whitbread Prize has brought him profound satisfaction . The British pounds20,000 ( $ 31,600 ) award means he and Margaret may one day buy a car , if she obtains a driver 's license . He would also like to fulfill a long-standing dream of visiting New Orleans to hear live jazz , his passion ; that too , however , is on hold . He and Margaret flew on an airplane for the first time in their lives when they came to London for the preliminary awards dinner last November . <p> Still , for Torrington , one of the best rewards of all to come from his literary achievement , he says , goes beyond the merely personal . He says it has been the overwhelming assumption that only university-educated , middle-class folk had something to say worth reading : not people such as himself , who write in a colorful combination of street jargon and working-class Glaswegian , which is more comfortable for him than standard English . <p> " Before , it was very much : How can you be a writer if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But with Jeff getting this award , working-class writers in Glasgow have been given a big boost - without a doubt .
