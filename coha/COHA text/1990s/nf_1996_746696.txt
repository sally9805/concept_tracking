Although entering freshmen generally perceive themselves as being capable of attaining their desired academic goals , educators have long recognized the gap between freshman optimism and the commitment needed to be successful academically ( Chickering &; Reisser , 1993 ) . This gap often translates into students failing to meet the academic challenges of adjusting to college life , especially those encountered during their freshman year . The adjustment is particularly difficult for underprepared fresh-men-those who require remedial classes . How effective are programs that are designed to bridge the gap for underprepared students ? The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of one community college 's College Success Program that was designed to assist underprepared freshmen in getting a solid start on their postsecondary careers . College Success Programs <p> Several Florida community colleges have provided academic intervention measures for entering freshmen by offering courses that deal with many of the documented pitfalls experienced by freshman students . Although there are several nationally recognized programs like David Ellis 's College Survival , Inc. and John Gardner 's Freshman Seminar , institutions commonly tailor such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In 1991 , Santa Fe Community College ( SFCC ) began to explore the implementation of a one-credit academic intervention course for entering freshmen ( LeBlanc , 1991 ) . The college had reported a freshman withdrawal rate of 33% during the fall of 1990 . Although 16% of those students subsequently enrolled for the spring 1991 semester , faculty and staff were concerned about the number of students who had identified withdrawal as an academic solution ( Grander , 1991 ) . A committee of student affairs professionals and faculty from several disciplines was assembled to assess the feasibility of an intervention course . An extensive review of the literature yielded the information needed to provide a foundation for curricular development and to evaluate the success of intervention courses at other institutions ( Cuseo , 1991 ) . <p> Miami-Dade Community College ( MDCC ) had reported success in improving retention rates of freshman students since 1984 and had attributed this success , in part , to a course called College Success ( Cuseo , 1991 ) . The results of MDCC 's initial study indicated that students participating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to persist and earn acceptable grade-point averages . After one year , findings indicated that 67% of participating students were retained , compared to 46% of nonparticipants ( Belcher , Ingold , &; Lombard , 1987 , p. 21 ) . Researchers concluded that if all first-time-in-college ( FTIC ) students in the semester studied had taken the course and received similar academic results , the college could have retained revenues in excess of $200,000 . Grade-point averages were also higher for students participating in the course when compared with those not participating . <p> The SFCC committee proposed using the strategies of Ellis 's College Survival , Inc. model and to pattern a course after the one offered at MDCC . The course would be offered at SFCC , and the committee strongly encouraged mandating the course for all incoming freshman and transfer students in the fall of 1991 . This course , SLS 1101  --  College Success , was subsequently offered at SFCC for the first time in the fall of 1991 . Since then , the course has evolved into a three credit-hour class . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic success . Opportunity is provided for students to discover effective ways of coping with the demands of college life and to gain understanding of personal issues impeding their academic progress . Practice of acquired skills in a supportive group is an integral part of the course as is the opportunity for students to develop a close relationship with a mentor who can support and guide them throughout their college careers . <p> Because College Success was strongly encouraged but not required at SFCC , the Student Affairs Division was concerned that students choosing not to participate in the course would miss critical information about the college . The Division assembled a campus-wide committee in the spring of 1992 to develop orientation sessions that would help provide essential information about SFCC to entering freshman and new transfer students . Again , these sessions were not mandatory , partly because the open-door admission policy made it difficult to enforce . Strong incentives to participate , however , were included . These incentives included one-stop assessment , academic advisement , advanced registration , student identification cards , early textbook purchase , and copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall of 1992 , more than 70% of the entering freshman and transfer students have taken advantage of orientation sessions during their first semester at SFCC . <p> The orientation sessions used the overview strategies of Ellis 's College Survival , Inc. model ; they were designed to expose entering freshman and transfer students to information about programs and services available at SFCC and to familiarize students with ways to obtain those services that might be critical to their academic success . The sessions were structured to include group and individual meetings with academic advisors who provided an overview of program requirements . These advisors also acquainted students with the SFCC computer-assisted academic advisement status sheet that is customized and mailed to each student prior to advanced registration the following term . <p> By implementing the College Success course and the orientation sessions , SFCC had in place by the fall of 1992 what it has designated as its College Success Program . Method and Data Sources <p> This study assessed the effectiveness of SFCC 's College Success Program by comparing the academic persistence and achievement of remedial students who chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term at SFCC . <p> The inability to assign students to groups randomly necessitated an ex post facto design for this study ( Smith &; Glass , 1987 ) . Such a design does not control for all potential threats to validity . Of particular concern is the " selection " threat , which introduces the possibility that groups were inherently different prior to beginning at SFCC . If such differences existed , it can not be ruled out that these differences accounted for the observed effects rather than the College Success Program itself . The inclusion of race and gender as covariates in this study rules out the effects of these two variables as sources of selection bias ( Campbell &; Stanley , 1963 ) . <p> Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) , a general linear model , was used to determine the relationships between the dependent and independent variables . Follow-up Tukey HSD comparisons of means and REG-Welsch comparisons of means were conducted if the ANOVA revealed significant differences by varying levels of student participation in the College Success Program . Statistical significance for all hypotheses was determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the results obtained could occur by chance no more than 5 times out of 100 ( Kerlinger , 1973 ) . <p> For the purpose of this study , fall course failure rate was defined as the number of credit hours a student earned with a grade less than C divided by the total number of credit hours earned ; fall course withdrawal rate was defined as the number of credit hours from which a student withdrew divided by the total number of credit hours attempted ; and fall grade-point average was defined as the total grade points earned during fall term divided by the total number of semester hours attempted for college credit during fall term , reported on a 4.00 scale . All 800 students had fall course failure and withdrawal rates ; 55 of the 800 students had no fall grade-point average because they withdrew from all of their fall courses . Credit hours and grade points earned in College Success were not included in these calculations to reduce any possibility that hours and grades earned in this course would obscure the relationship between the independent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of the 800 white and African-American students from SFCC in the fall of 1993 who identified themselves as seeking an associate of arts or associate of science degree , who were FTIC or new transfer students to the college , and who were enrolled in one or more college preparatory courses . Only white and African-American students were included in the study because the pool for all other racial groups was too small to yield meaningful results . <p> The data were analyzed to determine , while controlling for race and gender , ( a ) whether a significant relationship exists between the dependent variable of fall course failure rate and student participation in the College Success Program ; ( b ) whether a significant relationship exists between the dependent variable of fall course withdrawal rate and student participation in the College Success Program ; and ( c ) whether a significant relationship exists between the dependent variable of fall grade-point average and student participation in the College Success Program . Race and gender were controlled in this study because some critics of community colleges contend that race and gender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Gintis , 1976 ; Brint &; Karabel , 1989 ; Karabel , 1972 ; London , 1978 ; Zwerling , 1976 ) . Results <p> One hundred forty-four or 18.0% of the 800 students in the study were African American , and 656 or 82.0% were white ; 1,419 students or 52.4% of the 800 students were female ; 381 or 47.6% were male ; 83 students or 10.4% of the 800 students were African-American females , 61 or 7.6% were African-American males , 336 or 42.0% were white females , and 320 or 40.0% were white males . Table 1 presents by race and gender breakdowns the student participation levels in the College Success Program . Tables 2 through 4 present the range , mean , and standard deviation for each of the dependent variables by level of participation in the College Success Program and by the total student cohort . <p> The first research question investigated the relationship between the dependent variable of fall course failure rate and the independent variable ( student participation in the College Success Program ) . Using four levels of the independent variable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in orientation , enrollment only in the College Success course , and full participation in the College Success Program ) and the quantitative value for the fall course failure rate as the dependent variable , and looking at both race and gender effects , no race by gender by independent variable interaction effects were observed . However , when analyzed separately , both race and gender interacted significantly with the independent variable . Specifically , analyses revealed a significant association between participation in the College Success Program and fall course failure rate only among African-American students : F ( 3,139 ) = 3.18 , p &lt; .03 . Follow-up Tukey HSD comparisons of means revealed that only those African-American students who were enrolled in just the College Success course had a significantly lower fall course failure rate ( 0.26 ) than students not participating in any aspect of the College Success Program ( 0.50 ) . There were no significant differences in failure rates between students who had no participation in the College Success Program , those who participated only in orientation , and those who had full participation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant association between participation in the College Success Program and fall course failure rate for only female students : F ( 3,414 ) = 3.03 , p &lt; .03 . Differences in cell sizes and cell variances interfered with determining a significant difference between the means of the various levels of participation in the College Success Program when both follow-up Tukey HSD comparisons of means and REG-Welsch comparisons of means were conducted . <p> The second research question investigated the relationship between the dependent variable of fall course withdrawal rate and the independent variable ( student participation in the College Success Program ) . Using the four levels of the independent variable and the quantitative value for the fall course withdrawal rate as the dependent variable , and looking at both race and gender effects , the ANOVA revealed no significant interaction or main effects . <p> The third research question investigated the relationship between the dependent variable of fall grade-point average and the independent variable ( student participation in the College Success Program ) . Once again using the four levels of the independent variable and the quantitative value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking at both race and gender effects , no race by gender by independent variable interaction effects were observed . However , when race and gender were analyzed for interaction effects , both were found to interact significantly with the independent variable . Analyses revealed a significant association between participation in the College Success Program and fall grade-point average only among African-American students : F ( 3,113 ) = 3.69 , p &lt; .02 . Follow-up Tukey HSD comparisons of means revealed that African-American students who were only enrolled in the College Success course had a significantly higher fall grade-point average ( 2.47 ) than students participating only in orientation ( 1.43 ) and students with no participation in the College Success Program ( 1.58 ) but not a significantly higher grade-point average than students with full participation in the College Success Program ( 1.93 ) . <p> Further analyses revealed a significant association between participation in the College Success Program and fall grade-point average for only male students : F ( 3,346 ) = 3.30 , p &lt; .03 . Due to differences within cell sizes , the REG-Welsch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who only participated in orientation had a significantly lower fall grade-point average ( 1.81 ) than students only enrolled in the College Success course ( 2.31 ) and students fully participating in the College Success Program ( 2.32 ) . There were no significant differences in grade-point averages of males who had no participation in the College Success Program and those at any of the other three levels of participation in this program . Summary of Findings <p> In this study , participation in SFCC 's College Success Program was found to be significantly related to fall course failure rate for African-American and female students and to fall grade-point average for African-American and male students . Of note in these findings is the enrollment in the College Success course . Participation in SFCC 's College Success Program was not found to be significantly related to fall course withdrawal rate . Significance for Practice within Community Colleges <p> Although community colleges are capable of adapting academic intervention programs to meet the needs of their diverse student populations , the assessment of such program effectiveness has been sporadic . The literature supports the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is during her or his first academic year , especially the first semester  --  regardless of the institution attended ( Gardner , 1986 ) . This study suggests that academic intervention programs like SFCC 's College Success Program , especially the College Success course , can have significant effects on such adjustment during this critical period . <p> The conclusions reached by this study are supported by the related literature on student success and persistence and suggest the relevance of the College Success Program to increased student performance . There is evidence to support the program as a requirement for all first-time-in-college and new transfer students who have been assessed into college preparatory programs . The components of SFCC 's College Success Program constitute an extended intervention strategy developed to reinforce the importance of the relationship between study skills , time management , career goal assessment , and academic success . <p> Underprepared students requiring remediation often have not developed life skills that directly influence their ability to succeed academically in college . Developing these life skills along with strengthening basic academic skills can positively influence student persistence and retention toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously suffer economic consequences and , in the state of Florida , are accountable for students who are not academically successful . <p> The state of Florida 's accountability measures mandate , among other things , specific information about enrollment , persistence , and completion of degree programs . The state 's newly implemented performance-based budgeting measures , moreover , appropriate monetary rewards to community colleges largely based on student degree completions . The results of this study suggests that academic intervention programs can have a significant effect on such measures . Additionally , the commitment of community colleges to underprepared students is being increasingly challenged by the Florida Legislature , especially in light of diminishing financial resources . Institutions that can address legislative concerns with data will be able to debate the importance of serving academically underprepared students . Because this study deals exclusively with the underprepared student population , it can add to the body of literature on the value of intervention programs and , specifically , how SFCC 's College Success Program positively affects the first semester of enrollment for academically underprepared students .
