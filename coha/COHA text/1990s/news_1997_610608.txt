<p> Ginuwine , the R &B; singer formerly known as Elgin Lumpkin in Northeast Washington , says this of his old ' hood , slouching in his chair , like he 's weary of giving his ghetto-to-glory spiel : " It was n't real hard or nothing like that . Everybody has their ups and downs . Everybody has their problems . Yeah , there were drugs around my way . Yeah , there was killing around my way . Yeah , there was fighting around my way . But I knew I did n't want to be involved in that . I was always feeling like I was a strong-minded person . I would n't let anybody pull me into any drugs , pull me into fights . A lot of people say , ' My environment made me do it . ' People say that , but that 's just saying you 're weak . If you 're a strong-minded person , there 's nothing people can make you do . " <p> Now , he makes people do things . He 's made a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His fame , his good looks make them ooh and aah over him , grab at him . After a Memphis show , fans swarmed as he entered a limo and pulled off his sweat pants . At a Seattle show , a young woman ripped off her shirt and showed her breasts . <p> " I was shocked about that and other stuff , too , " he says , either naively or insincerely . How can he get crowds all shook up and not expect some fizz ? " People will come up to you and say they want you  --  stuff like that . It 's shocking but I know how to handle it . <p> " It comes from my upbringing , I guess , " he adds . " Never think you 're better than anybody else . Always stay focused . Stay grounded and know that it 's a blessing from God that you 're doing what you 're doing . My mother drilled me in that . That 's what I know . That 's what I 've known all my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to become R &B's; latest nasty boy . His hit single , " Pony "  --  an audacious blend of old-school R &B,; hip-hop beats and sexual overture ( " My saddle 's waiting/ Come and jump on it " )  --  has sold a million copies . He just completed a national tour with the Budweiser Superfest , playing in some of the country 's largest arenas . Quite a feat for someone who constantly chickened out of school plays as a kid . <p> Ginuwine has many faces . <p> Look once : On the cover of " The Bachelor , " the singer is swathed in black . His arms are folded across his chest . His gaze is subdued , as if he 's contemplating the mysteries of romance . He looks buff , mature and perfect down to his hands . <p> Look again : On music videos , he looks like an adolescent male model ( he 's done a few magazine fashion spreads ) . The camera loves his chiseled cheekbones , his large dark eyes , the planes of his forehead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideburns and " baby hair " brushed from his hairline give him the flavor of a gigolo-bama or the Artist Formerly Known as Prince . And , of course , no one can quite make out that video for " Pony , " where he dances for the crowd in a redneck cowboy bar . <p> Look one last time : In a performance at the Baltimore Arena , his 6-foot-5 frame is dwarfed by the immense stage . He looks like an energetic skinny kid , making dated Michael Jackson dance moves , screaming sexually explicit suggestions to thousands of screaming females in his sometimes nasal tenor : " Do You Want to Go Home With Me ? " <p> Backstage , on this early stop in the tour , his real face is relaxed as he pauses a moment before getting dressed for the performance . He 's about to change from his white sneakers , baggy jeans , long-sleeved T-shirt and leather motorcycle jacket into his stage clothes , which include red silk pants and the type of homburg hat favored now by so many young R &B; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing table are a can of Aqua Sheen hair spray , Johnson 's baby oil and Traditional Medicinals Throat Coat herbal tea . For the show , he 'll sprinkle a bit of blue glitter on strategic parts of his face that will sparkle along with the gold hoop earring and diamond stud in each ear . <p> He 's about to change into Ginuwine . <p> This is all he 's ever wanted to do . It 's business . In the same way that he and his producer , Timbaland , finished his album in two months , he approaches tonight 's show like business , as you imagine the child of a government worker might . This is a guy who knows he has no great voice like Johnny Gill . On his album , he says he works to support his son from a previous relationship , Elgin Jr . Like most acts out here , he 's put his age back . His label says he turned 24 last week . Maryland public records say he turned 27 . He finished paralegal school just in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work out . <p> " Two months , yeah , " he says of the album 's production . " We did n't have nothing to start with . We just had me and Timbaland  --  and something that we wanted to do very much , and do it quick and do it with no problems . We had to do it as quick as possible because I did n't want to go over budget or nothing like that . " <p> He grew up near the intersection of Bladensburg Road and New York Avenue , near the National Arboretum . His mother , Sandra Lumpkin , would occasionally take him there . " I did n't want to go to no arboretum , " he says . " But I went with my mom  --  had to do the son and mom thing . That 's what was basically happening . I did n't want to go , but I had to go . " <p> He was 12 when he began his entertainment career , as the youngest member of a D.C. break dancing crew called Finesse Five , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Physical Wonder . He thought he 'd gotten his first break into the big leagues when , about seven years ago , he signed with the Swing Mob label , a side project of Devante of the group Jodeci . But nothing ever came of the effort . <p> Ginuwine and the label 's other acts , including the rapper Missy " Misdemeanor " Elliott and Timbaland , eventually had to move on , but not without first forging strong bonds as struggling artists . Now , though signed to different labels , they have still appeared on one another 's albums and videos . Of them all , however , Ginuwine has definitely , as they say , " blown up . " <p> Ginuwine does n't want to be a one-album wonder , a face that 's here today and gone tomorrow . There are hints , when he wraps his airy vocals around a torch song like " Only When Ur Lonely , " of his potential as a singing stylist . <p> As a player in the black music industry , which he describes as " dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at around 4 a.m. just to feel he is keeping his edge on the competition . <p> " There 'll never be another Michael Jackson because there 's nobody who can start that young and continue to get support , " he says . " He could be out here two or three years , but then some other label is going to try and get somebody just like him . The only thing an artist can do is try to stay on top of his game and try to do the best you can . <p> " I know there 's a million guys out there trying to take my spot . My whole thing is to get up early . I 'm thinking that my competitor is sleeping , so that gives me a mental edge . When it comes to the show , I can look at them and say , ' I 'm gon na tear you up because you ai n't doing what I did . ' " <p> He 's going to make it happen because that 's how things happen in the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us do have a choice , " he says . " How many people do you know who came from the ghetto but still went to college and made something of themselves ? They did n't use that as an excuse and neither am I. I want to be able to tell people that I did what I did because I wanted to , not because people made me. "
