<p> With the war barely over , Life magazine laid out , in a 1946 photo essay , a " roseate and wondrous " American dream . A single-story stone-and-clapboard home appeared in the centerfold photo . And spread over the front lawn were the gadgets of the envisioned prosperity : a convertible , a three-burner electric stove , a small television screen embedded in a bulky wooden cabinet , a children 's slide , flimsy aluminum lawn chairs , a plastic garden hose , a gasoline lawn mower . <p> In hindsight , Life 's vision was surprisingly modest . The next quarter- century turned out to be a golden age , and as living standards rose , the furnishings of Life 's American dream became commonplace , even in the homes of many working poor . <p> Then came 1973 , one of the great turning points of the post-World War II era . It was the year in which the dollar came off the gold standard ; the oil embargo struck ; worldwide grain shortages developed . The widespread rise in prosperity came to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing income inequality , spreading poverty and outdated factories all left scars . An economy that had been so plentiful for so many for so long suddenly followed a different path , leaving big portions of the population behind . <p> Now the United States appears to be at another turning point . Some of the hallmarks of the 1946-73 era are reappearing . Perhaps 1997 will turn out to be as much a landmark in American economic history as 1973 . But the new age , if it materializes , is not likely to re-create the postwar sense of bounty . Instead , people are carrying into the future the residue of the stagnant years , and their compromised expectations . Rather than counting on rising prosperity , Americans are betting that by working ever harder , they may manage to cling to leadership in the world economy . <p> " We are not in any sense back , " said Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , a Nobel laureate in economics . " There may be some economic measures that are equal to or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of well-being . " <p> Three statistics from the old days have reappeared : a low inflation rate , an unemployment rate of less than 5 percent and a return of corporate profits , as a share of the overall economy , close to the hefty levels of the 1960 's . Not since the pre-1973 era have such hallmarks of a vibrant economy coexisted so persistently . <p> Naturally enough , these parallels with the golden era are generating considerable optimism . At McKinsey &; Company , the consulting firm , William Lewis , director of its Global Institute , declares that America 's competitive laissez-faire economy should be the model for all nations . <p> Wired , the monthly bible of the digerati , proclaims that the global economy , led by the United States , is entering a " long boom , " driven by powerful new technologies and the spread of capitalism to nearly every region of the world . And Fortune magazine , in a long article this month , states flatly of America : " These are the good old days . " <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old days . Holding onto a job now takes precedence over upward mobility , or getting decent annual raises . Just prolonging an expansion has become more important than generating the robust economic growth that made the pre-1973 period golden . Corporate success in global competition has become an overriding goal , even at the price of greater wage inequality or leaving some groups behind . <p> Longer hours on the job have displaced the pre-1973 goal of more leisure time to use the lawn furniture in Life 's " family utopia . " And job insecurity  --  " cowed labor , " in the phrasing of the economist Paul Samuelson  --  has become an accepted means of prolonging the economic cycle , mainly by suppressing wage increases and inflation . <p> " Before 1973 , " said Richard T. Curtin , director of the University of Michigan 's consumer confidence surveys , " there was this deep belief in personal financial progress . In that sense , it is very different today . We do n't expect a recession . But we no longer have much faith that our incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired more possessions , prosperity itself has a different meaning . The pre-1973 economy often expanded in a given quarter at a 9 percent annual rate , or more . Since 1973 , that has never happened . But when growth reached 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996 and a rare 5.6 percent in this year 's first quarter , it was hailed with glee . " What people once called inadequate growth they are more likely to judge quite positively today , " Mr. Curtin said . <p> Looking back , 1973 has taken on the watershed status in American economic history of years like 1870 , which ushered in the Gilded Age , and 1929 , the start of the Depresssion . <p> In 1973 , the year the last American ground troops left Vietnam , the post- World War II generation was suddenly confronted with events that brought home just how much the global economy could alter their lives . Weak world grain harvests and the oil embargo introduced shortages , which fed inflation . So did President Richard M. Nixon 's decision to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall quickly in value . That made American food products more affordable abroad and they were snapped up , particularly by the Soviet Union , in a frenzy of deals that sent domestic prices soaring . <p> The oil and food price shocks diluted the effectiveness of the wage and price controls imposed by the Nixon Administration in 1970 to counter the costs of the war . By 1973 , inflation had become the No. 1 economic issue ; the inflation rate doubled that year . And partly as a result , the nation 's policy makers , along with many economists , did an about-face in their view of the economy 's productive capacity . The national output , once viewed as boundless , now seemed quite constrained . <p> Until 1973 , the big economic issue had been how to generate enough demand to keep the economy growing strongly . The standard measures included tax cuts , public works projects , jobs programs , a higher minimum wage . Supply was taken for granted . The prevailing view was that companies could always jack up production without much strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Herbert Stein , who was President Nixon 's chief economic adviser in 1973 . <p> That complacency changed by 1973 . Economists and policy makers came to attribute the supply shortages , and the rapid price increases , to limited capacity . Supply could not rise to match demand after all , the new view declared , because the nation lacked the necessary productive capacity . And soon attention focused on data that increasingly suggested built-in ceilings on the output of goods and services . " When belief shifted , reality did , too , " said David Collander , an economic historian at Middlebury College . <p> Capacity is three things . It is enough workers to make or provide all that Americans seek to buy . It is enough factories , offices , warehouses and stores , and enough machinery , computers and other equipment to produce all the goods and services that Americans want . Finally , there is productivity , or the amount that workers , using the buildings and equipment , can produce in a given time period . If productivity does not grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstrip supply . <p> From 1946 to 1973 , productivity rose , on average , nearly 3 percent a year . But after 1973 , the annual advances averaged only 1 percent , well below the long-term trend of more than 2 percent a year in the century after the Civil War . <p> So , starting in 1973 , the nation 's policy makers increasingly dealt with the perceived ceiling on supply by restricting demand . The restraint came from the Federal Reserve , whose principal tool for regulating the economy was interest rates . If unemployment got too low , that meant not enough labor capacity , and the Fed , rather than risk wage pressures and shortages , raised interest rates to discourage spending and reduce demand . By the end of the 1970 's , with inflation and unemployment rising in tandem , the Fed chose to fight inflation with higher rates , paying much less attention to unemployment . <p> In this atmosphere , labor 's bargaining power came unglued . Corporate profits weakened along with demand . The nation 's capital stock per worker  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job done  --  has grown more slowly in each decade since 1973 , despite huge investments in computers . And , starting in 1973 , the United States entered what is arguably its longest period of slow economic growth since the Civil War . <p> The official statistics say that economic growth is still modest . But the simultaneous arrival of low inflation , low unemployment and strong profits has some economists  --  and many corporate executives  --  convinced that the official statistics must be wrong . Solve the mismeasurement , they say , and the nation 's economic growth rate in recent years , supported by rising productivity , will come out looking a lot more like the pre-1973 years . <p> " We are not putting enough resources into getting the right data , " said Lawrence Klein of the University of Pennsylvania , a Nobel laureate in economics . <p> The new view is this : After much painful revamping and downsizing , American companies have regained their old efficiency , particularly in manufacturing . New technology and computers have played a big role in all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond quickly to changing circumstances . <p> But there is a different , less sanguine , way to explain the reappearance of the symptoms of the 1960 's . Productivity has not risen , according to this view . The new technologies , flashy as they are , do not begin to raise output and income as did those of the past  --  the railroad , the electric motor , the assembly line , the telephone , the gasoline engine , the jet airliner . <p> " There are hints every so often , " Mr. Solow of M.I.T. said , " that the productivity pace may be picking up , but they are mere hints . " <p> Instead , the new capacity is coming largely from overseas in the form of new factories and skilled , low-wage foreign labor that is quickly at the service of American consumers in an increasingly energetic global economy . <p> " If a Chinese manufacturer makes something that Wal-Mart then decides it wants , " Mr. Lewis of McKinsey &; Company said , " it buys in China and distributes massively in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity is the American worker himself . In the 1950 's and 1960 's , most families relied on one earner . Rising productivity pushed up incomes , making that possible . Today two or more people work in most households , and some studies say the typical American is working a greater number of hours , as well . <p> " People say to themselves , ' There is a possibility a year or two down the line I 'll be without a job , but now the economy is booming , and if the boss offers more hours I 'll take them , ' " said Barry Bluestone , a University of Massachusetts economist and the co-author of one such study . " They have to , to keep up consumption . " <p> Of such trends are turning points made  --  not back to the pre-1973 era or some other prosperous period , but to harder days of uncertainty . " It is impossible for anyone to say we have not entered into a new period , " said Jeffrey Garten , dean of the Yale School of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . " <p> In 1946 , Life magazine created this depiction of what it considered the dream to which American families aspired . Today , some economic measures suggest that America is entering another golden age like those postwar years . But a closer look shows that the differences outweigh the similarities . THEN  --  In the golden age of 1946-73 , the United States was relatively insulated from the global economy and produced most of what Americans consumed . NOW  --  Many more consumer goods are produced abroad , helping to restrain inflation but applying pressure to hold down wages . THEN  --  From the late 1940 's to the early 1970 's , incomes rose sharply , allowing many families with only one earner to afford the American dream . NOW  --  It generally takes at least two earners to achieve a middle-class living standard . THEN  --  In the first decades after World War II , productivity gains were strong , providing greater leisure time . NOW Not only are more people working , but 10-hour workdays are common , cutting into family life .
