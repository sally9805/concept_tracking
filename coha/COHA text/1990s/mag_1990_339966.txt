" I want it known nationally that I do n't ever want to see my father again , " David Rothenberg , 13 , declared last week in Buena Park , Calif . He is still horribly scarred from the burns he suffered in 1983 when Charles Rothenberg , in a custody fight with his ex-wife , poured kerosene over the boy and set him afire . The elder Rothenberg , 49 , was released last week from a California penitentiary , having qualified for parole after serving just half of a 13-year sentence for arson and attempted murder . To keep him away from David , the state will spend an estimated $648,000 for three years of round-the-clock surveillance . <P> While working as a typist at an undisclosed location , Rothenberg will be watched by corrections officers and will wear an electronic monitor on his wrist . California spends $2,970 a year to supervise an average parolee.
