When Valerie Lee , a self-described " super-clean mom , " turned from her scrubbing to check on two-year-old Kirsten , the child was cradling a bottle of full-strength , corrosive cleaning fluid between her legs , and yellow liquid spotted the corner of her mouth . It took Lee three tries before her shaking fingers successfully dialled the phone number of the local poison control centre . " I had no idea how much she 'd taken . The panic I felt , the guilt I felt , the sweat that broke out on my brow  --  and she was n't even unconscious . " Lee somehow heard the operator tell her to get her daughter to an emergency ward . A neighbour drove . Fortunately , as it turned out , Kirsten did n't seem to have swallowed any of the cleaning fluid . Kirsten has since grown into a healthy 24-year-old woman , with three equally robust siblings . And her once-panicked mother is now the president of a national association that promotes child safety-the Infant &; Toddler Safety Association ( ITSA ) , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group even existed , " Lee recalls now of that incident . " But it scared the bejesus out of me . " Lee learned the hard way that a single slip can create an opportune moment for your child to get into any of the dozens of dangerous materials kept around the house . You can poison-proof your home as much as possible , she says , but it 's important to be ready for the day your vigilance slips . A parent 's first step is to take inventory . Contact your local poison control centre for a list of dangerous substances , then round up the materials that could pose a danger . Few will have skull-and-crossbones markings ; many , like analgesics , are virtually harmless to adults even in relatively large doses , but are hazardous for children . Others , like perfumes containing large amounts of alcohol , show no clue of what 's in their formula . In kitchen , laundry , bedroom and bathroom areas , locked cabinets should store infrequently used cleaning products , medicines and cosmetics . In the garage or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by keeping the entire room locked . But in case they do tiptoe in , one big cupboard should have everything  --  from insecticides to motor oil , paint , turpentine or glue  --  locked inside . Most importantly , be aware that you need to keep everyday products out of the reach of tiny hands . Even purses can contain enough headache tablets or cosmetics to harm a child . Bear in mind the remarkable agility and curiosity of a small child  --  and if your four-year-old can get to the back of the highest shelf , store the material behind child-safety latches . Unlatching your cupboard every day to get at the dishwasher detergent is a minor inconvenience that 's truly worth the trouble . Store everything in original , labelled containers , so any adult in charge will be able to tell a poison control centre what was in the bottle your child polished off . " It could be the babysitter there , or Aunt Dorothy , when it happens , " explains Lee , " and she 'll have no idea what 's in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for your child at their homes occasionally , ask them to use these preventive measures as well ; kids love exploring new environments , and occasional caregivers may not be as sensitive to what Lee calls the mother 's ear for " the suspicious silence . " Seemingly innocent house and garden plants can also be harmful . Indoors , for instance , split-leaf philodendron or dieffenbachia can burn a child 's mouth . Begonias are toxic . Outside , rhubarb leaves are irritants , and lily of the valley is toxic . " And what a lot of parents do n't understand is that if you 're fertilizing the soil , that soil can be poisonous to the child as well , " Lee points out . " Taste is no deterrent whatever to a child . " Poison control centres keep lists of plants to avoid indoors and out , and gardening centres can help identify the common names of more esoteric varieties , if you bring them the plant or one of its leaves . Even university botany departments may be of help for more obscure plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other unexpected home dangers include post-party detritus like cigarette butts or half-empty drink glasses ; these contain enough nicotine or alcohol to make a toddler very ill . Obviously , cleaning up thoroughly and immediately after a party is important . But even the most diligent parent ca n't create a completely safe environment . Little ones tend to explore with their mouths . As your child grows , repeatedly explain the differences between food and non-food . " The child has to learn to recognize the poison symbol , to know what the corrosive symbol is , and that they mean " Do n't touch , " " says Lee . " This is a gradual learning process . " She also advises parents never to refer to medicine as candy . And adults should take their own medications when the kids are n't watching  --  little ones like to mimic their parents . Dr. Michael McGuigan , medical director of the Ontario Regional Poison Information Centre , notes that most accidental poisonings occur in children under six , and are about equally split between pharmaceuticals and other substances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parent off-guard . Says McGuigan , " What they can get into changes from year to year as they grow . Children in diapers can get into something on the changing table .... That 's where talking to the family doctor or paediatrician comes in handy , identifying the developmental stages . " Keep the phone number of your local poison control centre posted prominently by the telephone . Every province has one ( see the list on p. 26 ) . If you have the number on speed-dial , give the code to any other caregiver you use , and post it by the phone as well ( panic causes instant forgetfulness ) . Dr. Milton Tenenbein , Winnipeg-based president of the Canadian Association of Poison Control Centres , says that when you call a poison centre , you should have the product container with you , so you can tell the operator what the child swallowed . Be ready to provide an estimate of how much was ingested , and when . Know the child 's weight and age as well . Accurate information will help the poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cases , says Tenenbein , will be nothing  --  up to 90 percent of poison centre calls do not require any active intervention , he points out . There 's some disagreement in the medical community , though , about inducing vomiting by giving the child syrup of Ipecac . Tenenbein does not believe Ipecac should even be kept in the house , because " if it 's in the home , it tends to get used even if it 's not needed . " McGuigan agrees that Ipecac , once routinely kept in homes , has begun to fall out of favour , but he does n't rule it out entirely . He suggests keeping a bottle at hand only in case a poison control centre tells you to use it with a child who 's swallowed something that could be lethal if not vomited up immediately . " It could be the difference between a toxic dose and a sub-toxic dose , " he explains . But you should never induce vomiting unless the poison centre orders it ( certain substances can do more damage when brought back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedies of salt water or mustard water to induce vomiting . If the centre does advise use of Ipecac , follow directions exactly . Ask how much to use , and whether to follow the dose with fluids ( usually water ) ; if so , ask how much liquid and whether you should give more fluids if vomiting does n't occur within 20 minutes . Keep the child 's head lower than the hips to lessen the likelihood of swallowing vomit or aspirating any into the lungs . And finally , says Lee , try to remain calm and think clearly . " I think , as adults , we have to practise these emergency situations .
