<p> To the Editor : <p> Contrary to your assertion in " The Politics of Anti-Politics " ( editorial , Sept. 26 ) , the movement taking hold across the country to limit the tenure of legislators is anything but antipolitical . The popularity of this movement in such diverse locales as Oklahoma , Colorado and California is a reaction to legislative ineptitude , incapacity and corruption . Americans have grown weary of the " permanent government " that dominates the United States Congress and most state legislatures . <p> However , this movement also reveals a nascent desire to recapture the virtues of authentic self-government and amateur democracy in America . It is profoundly " pro-political " in that it seeks to restore the opportunity that every citizen in the polity must have to rule and be ruled . This stands in sharp contrast to the modern practice of governance by professionals and careerists . <p> Opponents of term limitations allege that they are un-American and un-democratic . This is the dominant rhetoric in California by those who oppose two ballot measures that would limit the terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to much historical or empirical scrutiny . <p> In the " new world " of the 18th century , limits on the terms of officeholders or required rotation in office was viewed as a tenet of radical democracy . During the revolutionary and federal periods in America examples of this view are abundant . <p> The Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 , the most radical constitution of the revolutionary era , had strict limits on officeholders and required rotation in office . The Articles of Confederation ( 1781 ) also required rotation in office for all delegates , stating that an individual could serve as a delegate in only three out of every six years . The " Virginia Plan , " presented at the Constitutional Convention , similarly called for restrictions on the re-eligibility of all national officeholders . While mandatory rotation was not included in the final draft of the Constitution , many convention delegates assumed that voluntary rotation after brief periods of service would be the norm . Thus , there is a strong American precedent for term limits that emerges from radical democratic theory in contrast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The political principle supporting term limitations is deeply rooted in ancient and post-Enlightenment theories of democratic citizenship and representation . For Aristotle , democratic citizenship was possible only where there was reciprocity of " ruling and being ruled by turn . " <p> Thus , for democracy to flourish , there must be significant rotation in office . The power of incumbency and the desire of many politicians to pursue lifelong careers as professional legislators make significant turnover in office impossible . The Aristotelian position is consistent with the expectations of the American framers that most elected officials would serve forbrief periods of time and then return home to resume their previous occupations . Indeed , throughout the late 18th and most of the 19th centuries , this expectation was fulfilled . Prior to the 1890 's , most members of the House of Representatives did not make a career out of service to the House . Rather , they served for a term or two and then voluntarily retired to take other elected positions or pursue other endeavors . <p> The anti-federalists , who criticized the United States Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of term limits in a political system striving to maintain a limited government . Anti-federalists such as New York 's Brutus advocated required rotation in office to prevent the abuse of public power by entrenched incumbents . Brutus also extolled the representational advantages of required rotation : " It would give opportunity to bring forward a greater number of men to serve their country , and would return those , who had served , to their state , and afford them the advantage of becoming better acquainted with the condition and politics of their constituents . " These advantages remain relevant to the plight of modern American politics , where few individuals have the opportunity to serve due to the power of incumbency and where so many career legislators easily lose touch with their constituents and the public good . <p> Finally , it is erroneously asserted that effective government requires individuals with political experience and expertise . To the contrary , professionalism and careerism in politics is the bane of democratic governance . Classical democratic theory privileges the role of the amateur over that of the professional in the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , there is no empirical evidence that professional politicians do a better job of governing than amateurs at any level of government . Rather than producing more effective legislators , experience in government tends to produce legislators who are more interested in defending government than they are in solving serious public problems . <p> Term limits are squarely within the American political tradition , and if adopted throughout our political system they would enable more citizens to experience the art of governance within the constraints of a representative republic . This is , after all , the essence of politics in a democratic society . MARK P.
