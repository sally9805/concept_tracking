Section : Business Reviving America Few defense contractors will be able to convert military business into peacetime profits <p> Richard Campbell , president of Westinghouse Security Systems , is the first to admit that getting the engineers of his company 's defense electronics group to make the switch from military radars to home burglar alarms had its difficulties . We had to get people adjusted to the idea that this thing does n't have to be able to fall off an 80-story building or survive minus 40 degrees Celsius , ' says Campbell . The idea that you can go to Radio Shack for a part is something new for us . ' <p> Culture shock ' is the phrase that comes to mind . After 45 years of doing business the Army way  --  or the Navy or Air Force way  --  companies hoping to make the transition into the commercial world are discovering that coming up with a product is almost the least of their problems . Controlling costs , understanding customer needs , even such basics as marketing and salesmanship , are all terra incognita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality is that the simple image conveyed by the words defense conversion ' is never simple in practice . <p> In fact , examples of defense contractors that have successfully switched from military to civilian products in recent years are so rare as to be almost nonexistent . Most have responded to declining defense budgets with layoffs , shutdowns or liquidation . Last week , General Electric said it was selling its aerospace division to Martin Marietta for $3 billion . General Dynamics earlier this year sold its missile business to Hughes Aircraft and has been negotiating to sell its crown jewel ' fighter division . <p> A study by the congressional Office of Technology Assessment predicts that up to 2.5 million defense jobs will disappear by 2001 . California , whose 54 electoral votes were crucial to Bill Clinton 's victory , has already lost more than 100,000 defense jobs since 1988 ; both the aerospace giants and a string of secondary suppliers face further layoffs . <p> If healthy economic growth can be sustained , these dislocations could possibly be absorbed over the long run . Clinton 's technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense to dual-use technologies that will lead to new civilian and military products . But the long run offers little solace to the millions of engineers , managers and skilled workers who are finding the skills of a lifetime no longer in demand . <p> Recent attempts by companies to diversify show why few industry experts hold out much hope for a post-World-War-II-style changeover of existing plants from bombers to buses or radar to radios . It 's not literally impossible , ' says Katherine Gillman , who directed the OTA study , but it 's not going to happen very often . ' Among the obstacles : <p> Culture . One of the difficulties companies point to is a lack of the management , production and sales skills needed to operate in the commercial world . In the defense world , you 're notified of bids , you negotiate a long-term relationship and you do n't go knocking on doors and say , Here 's our brochure , ' ' says Bruce Andrews , who was president of the now defunct UNC Naval Products , which made nuclear reactor components @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrews says , an obvious weakness ' was the lack of a classic ' marketing organization : If you have n't dealt in that world , you do n't even know where to start . ' In World War II , defense production was a brief interruption for most manufacturers , whose primary business was cars or other consumer products . But today , after 45 years of cold war , defense is the only thing many defense manufacturers know . <p> What 's more , says Gillman , you do something very different when you sell to the Defense Department . ' With a single customer , what matters most is inside knowledge of the Pentagon ; salesmen ' are often retired military officers , valuable for their contacts and understanding of Pentagon ways , rather than for skill in hustling a product . <p> The record-keeping requirements imposed on government contractors also demand a very different set of skills  --  one reason that companies like Boeing that make both civilian and military products have separate divisions for each . If you are selling a can of chili con carne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground beef and salt , you have to fill out 35 pages of specifications , ' notes Daniel Burton of the private Council on Competitiveness . If you think about the kind of organization you need to service that kind of request , you can see it 's not what you need to sell to the commercial market . ' Adds Christopher Bade of the firm Arthur D. Little : The whole concept of understanding customers ' needs is alien to the defense industry . The product has been more or less defined for you ' in DOD specs that place a premium on high performance , not low cost . <p> Equipment . Although defense hardware may push the state of the art  --  the need for compact airborne computers , for example , drove the development of ultra-high-density chips  --  the defense industry 's manufacturing base is often antiquated and unsuited to low-cost , high-volume production . For example , U.S. shippers complain that domestic shipyards , complacent from years of guaranteed Navy contracts , failed to modernize ; as a result , their prices are nearly double foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invest in modern plant and equipment , argues Bade , because improvements that reduce costs also reduce profits . <p> And the extremely high precision required of many defense products has far fewer applications in the commercial world . To meet the stringent tolerances of nuclear reactors , UNC Naval Products had invested heavily in precision machining and welding equipment . When orders for new submarine reactors fell to almost zero in 1989 , the company identified several products that it believed could take advantage of its key strength ' in precision manufacturing . Medical prosthetics was one . Yet the backbone of the new operation was still defense . When a $1 million contract to develop a space nuclear reactor for the Strategic Defense Initiative was terminated this year , the company ( since renamed UNC Manufacturing Technology ) abandoned manufacturing , and its employment rolls dropped from 1,200 to six.Its one viable product ' has been advising other companies on improving quality control . Defense conversion , diversification  --  they 're great buzzwords , ' says Andrews . But the reality is , you ca n't switch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Markets . After World War II , 25 million defense workers and servicemen were discharged , but the postwar boom quickly absorbed them . As the only industrial nation to escape destruction , America held a commanding position in the world economy ; accumulated savings and a lack of consumer goods ( production of housing and cars had been halted to increase war production ) created huge pent-up demand . <p> In the current cutback , defense manufacturers hoping to move into the commercial arena are competing against established suppliers in a shaky economy . They not only have to find a suitable product , they also have to outcompete companies with decades of experience . The problem is exacerbated by the specialization of defense firms , which on average earn about 80 percent of revenues from military contracts . Displaced workers also face a problem of market saturation : Fifty-seven percent of defense jobs are in manufacturing , versus 17 percent in the economy as a whole . Aerospace companies looking to commercial sales to compensate for defense losses may also be disappointed in the current economy . Boeing reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , largely a result of a falloff in orders from airlines . <p> Even the success stories reveal the limited possibilities . When Westinghouse 's Baltimore-based defense electronics group began studying nondefense options in 1989 , Ed Silcott , who heads the effort , decided the important thing was to get his engineers excited . When you mention diversifying , the first thing that goes through the average employee 's mind , ' Silcott says , is : Oh my God , does this mean I 'm out ? ' ' His aim was to appeal to the technical and emotional strengths of the staff  --  emphasizing the company 's experience in building automated systems that collect and analyze large amounts of data and reassuring engineers that they would still have challenges . For an enterprise experienced in building air-traffic-control systems , it was a natural step to systems that keep track of truck fleets and city buses from a central location . Denver , Milwaukee and Baltimore have purchased the company 's bus-tracking systems . <p> Home security and law enforcement were a natural , too , Silcott says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're so used to having an enemy to relate to . ' There was also a careful calculation to pick only fields that were huge ' and growing rapidly . ( Campbell begins his presentations on Westinghouse 's home alarm system by saying , Crime is up 15 percent . That 's the good news ! ' ' ) The company has installed close to 200,000 burglar alarms , capturing 8 percent of the market after starting from zero 2 1/2 years ago . <p> But much of the electronics group 's sales remains with government  --  radars for the Federal Aviation Administration , bar-code readers for the Postal Service . Two thirds of its revenues are still from DOD sales ; the company wo n't say how much of the remaining third is from nongovernment clients . Defense contractors say they have a unique technological competence but then talk about selling to NASA or another government agency , ' says Burton . What they 're really saying is their core competence is selling to government . ' <p> And whenever Westinghouse has moved into purely commercial markets , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already have marketing and distribution channels and knowledge of what customers are looking for . The company has hardly been immune from layoffs , though , cutting 4,500 jobs in the past two years . <p> It 's not realistic to think that the answer or even a major answer is large-scale conversion of large companies , ' says the OTA 's Gillman . The way to look at conversion that 's more hopeful is to help new businesses start up . ' The short answer : Pray for strong , sustained economic growth . <p> <p> Dependent on Defense TABLE <p> Picture : Conversion . Westinghouse 's phased-array radar , used to help track drug traffickers , is a modified version of the radar system that the company makes for the F-16 fighter . ( Jeffrey MacMillan  --  USN &WR); <p> Pictures : Changing times . During Word War II , the Michigan made B-24 Liberator bombers ; in the postwar boom , the factory was turned into an assembly line for Kaiser and Frazer autos . Today 's shaky economy makes defense conversion a much tougher proposition .
