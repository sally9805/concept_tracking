The crisp snap of an October morn . The distant roar of a football stadium . The chatty drone of Oscar hopefuls being hyped . The inescapable thud as Michael Crichton 's next best seller hits bookstores every-where . Yes , fall brings not only nature 's harvest but culture 's as well . A selective look at the new season 's glories ... <P> SHAKESPEARE : THE OLD JANE AUSTEN <P> School begins , and Hollywood hits the books . Keeping one eye on the Motion Picture Association membership and the other on the guard dogs of media morality , studios are releasing movies from the works of Henry James ( Portrait of a Lady ) and Thomas Hardy ( Jude , as in The Obscure ) . The film industry has always loved the classics : they 're pedigreed , they 're passionate , they 're public domain . But a few long-dead writers must have great agents  --  they get their names in the title . Daniel Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe . William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet . <P> Shakespeare , it turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " So there , Jane Austen ! " , the Bard is back in maximum force . There are two films based on Romeo and Juliet : one using the text but transplanted to a Miami-esque beach town ; the other , Love Is All There Is , set in the Bronx and retold by writer-directors Joseph Bologna and Renee Taylor . Royal Shakespeare Company alumnus Trevor Nunn has a Twelfth Night starring Helena Bonham Carter and Nigel Hawthorne . Richard III , recently modded up by Ian McKellen , gets the Al Pacino treatment in Looking for Richard . <P> But all bow before Kenneth Branagh , Shakespeare 's most doting and dogged courtier . Last year he played Iago to Laurence Fishburne 's Othello and made a film , A Midwinter 's Tale , about doing Hamlet in the provinces . This year he directs and stars in Hamlet  --  every word of Shakespeare 's longest play  --  and has cast it with nearly every tony Brit actor ( Derek Jacobi , John Gielgud , Kate Winslet , Rosemary Harris ) but Emma Thompson . There are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crystal . How do you say shtick in Elizabethan English ? <P> HALSTON 'S REVENGE  --  ULTRASUEDE IS BACK <P> Vegetable tones , maxiskirts  --  fashion has revived the ' 70s once again . But nothing has captured the Liza-at-Studio-54 aspect of the era as redolently as Ultrasuede , the must-have synthetic for fall . A wonder of chemical processing , faux suede is turning up in the form of trousers , shirts and belts from such hot young designers as Jill Stuart , Cynthia Rowley and the Morrissey Edmiston team . Stuart 's new Ultrasuede " Fonda " dress is long gone from the racks of L.A. 's Fred Segal . But the material does n't say retro to all . " The feel is casual elegance , " explains handbag designer Kate Spade . " I do n't look at my bags and think Rhoda . " <P> ON TV , IT FEELS MORE LIKE 1986
