<p> THE TASTE for historical and critical revisions that took hold about 15 years ago apparently persists . " The Paintings of George Bellows " at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art ( through May 10 ) is outfitted like a revisionist project , with its rangy itinerary and ruminative color catalog . ( Organized by LACMA and the Amon Carter Museum , the show will travel to New York , Columbus and Fort Worth . ) But despite the pleasures and surprises it holds , this retrospective is unlikely to change anyone 's estimate of Bellows ' standing in 20th century art . <p> Through retrospectives over the years , some artists in Bellows ' generation have been viewed from a new perspective . The Whitney Museum 's Marsden Hartley survey in the late 1970s , for example , caused the New York art world to do a double take , incredulous that a painter of Hartley 's power could have been critically slighted for so long . ( How the embittered Hartley might have reveled in that vindication ! ) <p> The National Gallery 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite effect , making much of her art appear thin and overvalued . The O'Keeffe show inadvertently disengaged her work , to its disadvantage , from her persona  --  that of the fully-formed woman painter  --  a figure that modern American culture seemed to require and to conjure . The retrospective made her life and work and their reception alike seem bouts of cultural destiny that just happened to be visited on her . ( It is also unquestioned that she was temperamentally amenable to this fate . ) <p> Nothing so dramatic occurs in the current treatment of Bellows . Though the beauty and ardor of some of his paintings are startling , he seems as much a period figure at the end of the show as at the beginning . <p> Bellows ( 1882-1925 ) was an acclaimed and occasionally controversial artist in his day . He was associated with the so-called Ashcan School of American painters , including John Sloan , William Glackens and George Luks , who found their subjects in the ordinary life of the city . <p> " I paint New York because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1915 , " and because the most essential thing for me is to paint the life about me , the things I feel today that are part of the life of today . " <p> European artists of Bellows ' generation , such as Fernand Leger and George Grosz , also felt the spurs of 20th century city life , but modernism offered them complex pictorial idioms that Bellows saw for the first time in New York 's 1913 Armory Show , which he helped install . <p> Bellows approached painting and subject matter along the traditional American axis of realism . The battles he and his friends waged over the aptness of lowly urban subjects in art had been fought and won almost 50 years earlier in Paris . <p> In Europe , the issue had been ostensibly one of defending high art tradition against the incursion of vulgar subject matter . In America , art was still treated as an arena of national self-definition , which gave questions of realism  --  American art 's strength  --  an ideological weight . <p> At a time of angry debate over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bellows ' paintings of jam- packed tenement neighborhoods ( " Cliff Dwellers , " 1913 ) and scofflaw children ( " River Rats , " 1906 , " Forty Two Kids , " 1907 , had the force of social criticism . His famous paintings of scrapping boxers ( " Stag at Sharkey 's , " 1909 ) too had an air of journalistic expose to people who wanted American art to be a campaign for civic gentility . ( Boxing had been declared illegal in New York in 1900 . ) <p> Even now , a few of Bellows ' pictures have the vividness of journalistic witness . His two 1909 views of the excavation for Manhattan 's Penn Station , for example  --  to their first viewers mere subjectless pictures of holes in the ground  --  will be thrilling to anyone who has ever waited for a train there . And his composite rendering of " New York " ( 1911 ) , more crowded with buildings , people and signs than contemporary photographs record , is a prescient portrait of the city as the capital of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did contribute to the socialist periodical , " The Masses , " but Bellows was really in search of vigor in painting , not controversy , when he turned to what were seen as inflammatory themes . <p> Born in Columbus , Ohio , in 1882 , Bellows dropped out of Ohio State University in 1904 with the intention of becoming an illustrator in New York . No sooner had he enrolled in William Merritt Chase 's New York School of Art than he set foot in the mainstream of contemporary American realist painting . <p> He quickly became a star pupil of the influential Robert Henri , who disdained academicism and exhorted his students to deal with realities they knew firsthand . <p> The influence on Bellows of Henri and of other American realists , pre-eminently Thomas Eakins and Winslow Homer , is apparent throughout the retrospective . Bellows ' " Forty Two Kids , " for example , a view of urchins skinny-dipping in the East River , is a conscious reprise of Eakins ' " Old Swimming Hole , " except that Bellows ' picture has the briskness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristically , a wide-angle anatomy study in a landscape setting . <p> The revisionist thrust of the Bellows catalog is in LACMA curator Michael Quick 's detailed study of the artist 's painting methods . The accepted view of Bellows is that he " painted from the gut , not from the mind . " When you see the surging brushwork and brilliance of color in some of his landscapes of the teens and ' 20s , it is easy to understand why he is seen as an early precursor of Abstract Expressionism . <p> Quick shows that , far from being the instinctive painter of legend , Bellows was involved with theories of color and composition throughout his career . Diagrams in the catalog show how highly structured are many of his pictures that appear to report reality as found or recalled . <p> An explosion of color occurs in Bellows ' work after about 1911 . Things he saw in the Armory Show must have emboldened him further , for he soon developed a manner of painting seascapes that suggests the style of Winslow Homer as seen by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1913 ) , " Summer Surf " ( 1914 ) and " Easter Snow " ( 1915 ) , the interplay of description with the paint 's own physical and chromatic detail is as voluptuous and lively as any in American art . <p> The Bellows that emerges from this show is big with ambition and heart . He tried his hand at many things , from seascapes that test themselves against Homer and Rockwell Kent ( whom Bellows knew ) to portraits that try to be both as suave as James McNeill Whistler 's and plainly put as Henri 's . <p> THE retrospective gives a moving account of one artist modernizing himself . But the American art context was ill- primed then to transmit the influence Bellows ' example might have had . His late paintings in thin , zingy hues suggest a transition to a more daring synthesis than anything he had attempted before , but we will never know what it might have been . Bellows ' life ended in 1925 , from a ruptured appendix , when he was just 42 . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as citizens of the same century , so great is the distance in sensibility between them . Concurrent with the Bellows retrospective , LACMA is presenting a survey of works made by Mariani since 1974 . <p> Like the Jorge Luis Borges character who sets out to write " Don Quixote " himself  --  exactly as Cervantes wrote it  --  Mariani began in the early 1970s to invent 18th century neoclassical painting for himself . <p> At first he painted copies of celebrated period pictures and then went on to stage paintings of his own in the neoclassical idiom of antique references , idealized figures and programmatic sentiments . <p> The result , by and large , has been some of the most labor-intensive and campy conceptual art yet made , an improbable synthesis , if nothing else . You recognize this work as conceptual art by its being more involving to think about than to look at . <p> Only since 1989 has Mariani 's work begun to fulfill the comic promise of its laborious irony . In the past three years , he has begun mingling his neoclassical apparatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the famous bottle rack " ready- made " of Duchamp and Brancusi 's " Endless Column . " In " Composizione 3 " ( 1989 ) , a chalky nude stands before a Doric column holding what looks like a small mobile by Alexander Calder . Other Calderistic black shapes crowd in ominously around the edges of the picture . <p> Mariani 's work resonates with whatever nostalgia one may have for values it is no longer possible to hold or to communicate . That makes it a depressing experience , no matter its wry tone .
