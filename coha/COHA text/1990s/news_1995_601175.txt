<p> Comcast President Brian Roberts is gunning for a fight . <p> Wednesday , he 's due to become chairman of cable 's biggest trade group - the National Cable Television Association . The head of the No. 3 cable operator wants to lead the industry 's battle against the giant regional Bell phone companies . <p> They are cable 's top rival in a struggle to connect consumers to tomorrow 's phone , television and computer services . They are also intimidating . The regional Bells generated more than $ 100 billion in revenue last year - five times more than the cable industry . <p> Still , Roberts , 35 , insists that " cable is beautifully positioned " to compete . Today 's cable wires can transmit at least 180 times more voices , video images and data than phone lines can . <p> " It 'll be cheaper and quicker for us to get into their business than vice versa , " he says . " And it 's time for us to begin telling our story . " <p> This call to arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the last year in a funk because the federal government cut consumer rates by an average 17% . Many companies also want a leader with a vision that embraces more than movies , sports , music videos and sitcom reruns . <p> Roberts has emerged as a respected strategist . <p> " Brian has got a snap , crackle mind and he 's not afraid to exercise it , " says former QVC chief Barry Diller . <p> Ted Turner calls Roberts " a businessman with keen insight into the constantly changing telecommunications industry " and asked him to sit on Turner Broadcasting System 's board . <p> Even Bell Atlantic CEO Ray Smith says his young rival is " pretty smart , and he 's very aggressive . So he 'll make a good competitor . " <p> Roberts does n't come across like a corporate gunslinger , though . The lanky , 6-foot-2 executive is uncomfortable talking about himself . Married nearly 10 years and the father of three , he was the fourth of five children . He grew up around Philadelphia . He earned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pennsylvania . <p> But even as a youngster , Roberts knew he wanted to join the family-run cable business . " That 's been my lifelong dream , " he says . <p> His father , Ralph Roberts , started Comcast in 1963 after selling an outfit that distributed men 's cologne and accessories such as belts to department stores . " It looked to me like beltless slacks were coming in , " the elder Roberts says . " I thought the business was getting archaic . " <p> He used the money to invest in a new cable operation in Tupelo , Miss . Local residents wanted , but could n't get , TV signals from Memphis . <p> Young Brian watched as the business added franchises . At 15 , he tagged along while his father negotiated bank loans . By the early 1980s , he was excited about cable - and his own management skills . <p> He discovered how much consumers wanted cable in 1982-83 , when he was assistant general manager of Comcast 's franchise in Flint , Mich . Flint was in deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's unemployment rate to 22% . Yet the number of families that elected to pay about $ 20 a month for TV programming grew to 65,000 from 59,000 the year Roberts was there . <p> His conclusion : Consumers saw cable as a good value . " If you happen to be out of work , it 's even more important . " <p> Later in 1983 , Roberts became general manager of a franchise in Trenton , N.J. <p> His third day on the job , a Comcast employee laying cable under the city 's streets sliced a key telephone wire and cut local and long distance service for half of New Jersey . It was just before Mother 's Day weekend , when florists cash in on phone orders . <p> Roberts quickly ordered an employee to photograph the site to demonstrate the accident was n't Comcast 's fault . A contractor hired by the phone company to mark the street where it 's safe to dig had put a line in the wrong place . <p> " We said , ' Find someone from Bell who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're about to take a big PR hit , and whatever happens to us , we 're taking you down . " The phone company took responsibility . <p> That was the first of many battles Roberts has had with phone companies . <p> " Our industry is about to take some major steps into the telephone business , " says Joseph Collins , CEO of Time Warner Cable . " And Brian 's company has - for the last five years or more - been a major player in the telephone business . That 's going to be very useful as we change and evolve what we do . " <p> Roberts also is eager to connect computers to cable wires . New modems hooked to cable offer transmission speeds that are about 100 times faster than what 's currently available over the phone . " Brian is definitely interested in things that the old guys were not interested in , " says Diller . " But he knows where the money 's coming from , that 's for sure . Cable .

That includes companies many times larger than Comcast . <p>  --  Comcast took on Bell Atlantic in 1988 by paying $ 220 million for a rival cellular phone company , American Cellular , serving a region stretching from New Jersey through Maryland .

CBS chief Laurence Tisch backed out when Comcast tried to buy QVC in a deal that valued the company at $ 2.2 billion . <p> " They would have been better off with the CBS transaction , " says Diller . " But they had the right to bid on the company . . . . Within the structure of what I thought was a very destructive thing to do , they handled themselves correctly . " <p>  --  Comcast bought 57% of QVC in February after agreeing to let Tele-Communications Inc. own the rest . <p>  --  Comcast joined cable 's TCI and Cox Communications , and long-distance-phone carrier Sprint in a venture to provide wireless phone service .
