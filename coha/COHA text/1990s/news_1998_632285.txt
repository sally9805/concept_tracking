<p> Once again , people who choose responsibility are being persecuted under President Clinton 's proposal for tax breaks on child care . <p> My husband and I thought over our options before we had children . He works part-time on days , and I work the twilight shift . We lost approximately 25 percent of our income , but we are raising our own children ! <p> And now , through our taxes , we 're not only losing that 25 percent , but we 're being asked to help fund people who take the easy way out . <p> I 'm all for helping single parents who have lost their spouses ( not divorced  --  another easy out ) raise their children because they have very limited options . But because people think they ca n't afford not to work , we pay for their lack of responsibility . <p> I took the maximum time off allowed by my company without pay for both my children . The first was born before the Family Leave Act took effect , so I took five months without pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my second child I also took five months off , but my health and welfare were covered this time by the Family Leave Act . This was a very positive bill passed by President Clinton . It reinforces being with your children . <p> I nursed both my children for a year each , using my breaks at work to pump milk for my husband to feed to them . Was it easy to do ? Not by any definition . But based on the information given to us about what makes a child well-rounded and healthy , these were decisions we made for the best possible start to our children 's lives . <p> My sister gave up an $ 80,000-a-year job and moved to Washington state because it seemed more family friendly , and the cost of living was cheaper , which allowed her to stay at home to raise her children . <p> We both have two small children and live from paycheck to paycheck because we feel that our children are worth our time and effort . <p> Why do n't we get the tax credit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UFvoxppCourageous column <p> A big hurrah for Mary Mitchell on her column ( Dec. 28 ) about the dreaded N-word , probably the most powerful pejorative in the English language that is not blunted by repeated use . <p> It was a courageous stand to take . I fully agree that its vocalization by some members of the African-American community does not justify utterance by others . If one expects to be treated as a human being by members of the out group , then this form of self-hate is inexcusable and counterproductive at any time . <p> However , members of Mitchell 's ethnic group are not the only practitioners of self-loathing . <p> We still have a long way to go to become more respectful of ourselves , before we can accept our fellow Americans of different backgrounds . <p> Herb Kraus , Near North Side <p> Know the score <p> Despite its flaws , Dennis Byrne 's essay on the " dumbing down " of the Chicago Fire Department is basically right ( " Intelligence is apparently not important , " column , Jan. 1 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards and bodes ill for future performance levels . Nevertheless , the situation is more of a mixed bag than Byrne frames it : <p> What 's the proven correlation between test-passing success and on-the-job success ? <p> How might the most senior 20 percent of the department score on today 's test , instituted long after they joined the department ? <p> Successful test-taking is partly a learned skill . But if that 's the drill , then minority test-takers need to follow suit , competing mentally as they do physically . <p> Offering " merit " slots confirms that either the game is rigged against minorities , or that inner-city schools have failed to develop their intellectual assets . If so , then cleanse the process to level the playing field . If not , instead of making excuses , make good , just as all candidates do , minorities included , when taking state licensing exams to practice law , medicine or pharmacology , or to sell real estate or insurance . <p> Ted Z. Manuel , Hyde Park <p> Do n't tune kids out <p> Parents should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When returning a video , I listened to two families waiting to rent videos at my neighborhood store . Both parents had five to six videos plus video games in hand . They were stockpiling , so dad would n't be bothered while he watched football all New Year 's Day . <p> All I could think about was if families are this bad at entertaining their children now , what will it be like when these children become parents ? <p> Parents need to be selective in the use of this technology . There is no substitute for being a good parent , so please check your TV guide and see if you can fit your kids in today ! <p> Wm . S. Novak , Mokena <p> No difference <p> I 've been a member of the Chicago Fire Department for over 30 years . I can tell you there is no color to a face in a smoke-filled room and no difference in a child 's cry . <p> John W. Schmit , Austin <p> Girls nastier <p> The rumor when we all were in school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories and used dirtier language in the bathroom and locker rooms than boys did . <p> This came back to mind with Andrew Herrmann 's column ( Dec. 23 ) on girls being nastier and sneakier than boys . They certainly are ! <p> When I was teaching junior high ( 20 to 30 years ago ) , when boys had an argument , they would go out on the playground and throw punches . In the end , it was as if the dispute never took place . <p> But girls will work to alienate their foes . It was often painful to watch  --  and hard to combat , not only for the student but for the teacher trying to soften the blow . <p> And this would go on for a long time ; you never really knew when it all ended . Most likely , the offender would be welcomed back into the fold only when there was a new sacrificial victim to be ostracized . <p> Sometimes it could remind one of the ever-changing alliances in 19th century Europe . <p> Maybe this is why polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a male boss . At least they know where they stand , and that the male boss will probably be more above-board and honest than a female boss . <p> Hugh Spencer , La Grange <p> Scientists omitted <p> Remarkably absent from your listing of notable deaths ( Dec. 30 ) are individuals from the science , technology and engineering professions . <p> 1997 saw the passing of Jerome Lemelson . With more than 500 patents to his credit , Lemelson is reported to be the nation 's most prolific inventor since Thomas Alva Edison . <p> Chemical engineer Victor Mills also left us last year , at age 100 . His claim to fame was inventing the disposable diaper , processed ( stackable ) potato chips and other household products . <p> Most assuredly their achievements will outlive the accomplishments of some of the celebrities listed in your piece . <p> Robert B. Johnson , <p> Buffalo Grove <p> By e-mail <p> Remembering Biggie <p> As a loyal reader , I was appalled to read " A final farewell : ' 97 in review , " obituary story and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of Christopher Wallace , better known as the " Notorious B.I.G . " or " Biggie Smalls . " <p> Wallace was a very popular rapper who crossed all racial and socioeconomic boundaries . Unfortunately , Biggie Smalls was also part of the East Coast/West Coast gangsta rap war and was gunned down on March 9 in Los Angeles while leaving a celebrity event following an awards show ( news story , March 10 ) . <p> Why was n't he mentioned in your story ? His death , like another star rapper , Tupac Shakur 's , shocked the hip-hop nation and sent hundreds of thousands of teenagers and young adults scrambling for answers to these senseless murders . <p> I believe very strongly that while Smalls may not have walked on the moon or discovered a cure for AIDS , his death was not in vain , and he was a master of his craft , bringing the story of urban life through song to the ears of millions . <p> Rest in peace , Biggie . <p> Kasma Whitt , Wheaton <p> Airing it out <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They both take off . <p> Raymond F. Stoiber , <p> Joliet
