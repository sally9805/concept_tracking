My mother 's uterus was all whorls and tangles when I was born . " Like a bird 's nest , " she told me a decade or so later . " I was so lucky to have carried you . " When my parents learned that their first child was likely to be their only one , my father offered to name me after my mother and her mother : Michelle . My mother offered to name me after my father 's dead father , Meir . They settled on the name I 've got , Michal . <p> " It was a conflict of generosities , ably resolved , " Aunt Sylvie told me when I was eleven . " Our family excels at adaptation . It 's not always easy . You 'll see , " she warned . <p> All I saw then was that I would probably never have siblings . It did n't seem like much of a loss . I certainly was n't lonely , with so many people wandering in and out of our house-my parents ' friends ; my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live-in  --  usually a farmer 's daughter who came to us as a scared freshman ; four years later , a confident graduate , she 'd leave , though not until she 'd spent a day crying nonstop . Then there was our troupe of eager irregulars . Mr. La Pierre was the exterminator . Mr. La Pierre 's son dealt with pests , too , but grudgingly . He was moonlighting as a piano tuner , and he kept our instrument in regulation . The Orson twins were our handymen . Mr. Cantabile pruned our apple trees . <p> Mr. La Pierre the younger came by arrangement , every week , to practice on our baby grand . The piano was in Dad 's study ; and because Dad met with his graduate seminar on Thursday afternoons , at the university , Thursday became young La Pierre 's day . He 'd try anything . He played Chopin , Beethoven , Liszt , and Scott Joplin for his unseen audience-my mother and me , silent in the kitchen . He even attempted Scriabin . My mother felt bound to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she explained too that a home became exalted by the presence of a passionate lover of music ... by a passionate lover of anything ... by passion itself , Michal . The young exterminator could get through " To a Wild Rose " with almost no mistakes . <p> Besides the live-in and Mr. La Pierre Senior and Mr. La Pierre Junior and Mr. Orson and the other Mr. Orson and Mr. Cantabile , we were served by occasional helpers-accommodators , my mother called them-sent by Student Employment to tend bar at our annual open house and to help serve at Thanksgiving and Passover . They were usually graduate students , and they were always inept . At Thanksgiving somebody foreign-born would show up-a Spaniard or an Israeli for whom the holiday was a chance to make some money . At Passover only non-Jews appeared . Once we got a young black Baptist . He doubted that any of us had been slaves in Egypt ; I spotted him near the kitchen door during one of those lamenting passages , scowling . That Thanksgiving a gorgeous Costa Rican materialized , wobbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , even after she 'd borrowed my old bunny bedslippers . <p> One Passover a giant from Iceland walked in , stooping at every doorway . With his long face and forked beard he resembled a Romanesque saint . ( Aunt Sylvie pointed out the likeness ; she even mentioned the church where he was carved . ) He had never heard of Passover . My mother explained to him that for the first forty-five minutes , during the service , his job would be only to keep certain dishes warm . She hoped he 'd brought something to read . He had : Rimbaud in the original . But he shoved the book into his jeans pocket when my mother and I rushed into the kitchen for the gefilte fish , and as he speared the ovals from their jars he held his bony nose at a fastidious angle . When we brought in the empty fish plates from the dining room he ladled chicken soup into bowls ; he had served clear soup to half a dozen guests before we summoned him back for the matzo balls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the meal , his beard like two blowtorches . My young cousins never did find the Afikomen , though my father swore he 'd stashed it between Volumes Three and Four of Remembrance of Things Past . Also the accommodator took it upon himself to close the front door . He must have thought it had been left open by mistake . Elijah did n't have a chance . <p> These students were like guests in the house . The live-in was like a big sister . The La Pierres and the Orsons and Mr. Cantabile were like relatives , too . <p> On the night before Thanksgiving the year I was fifteen , my father and I went to the airport to pick up our real relatives : Sylvie , Dad 's sister , and Jack , her husband , and their three small boys . Sylvie and Jack were my parents ' age , early forties , but they had married late and had popped out their children in a hurried sequence . They lived in an underfurnished apartment on the West Side of Manhattan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came every Thanksgiving and every Passover . Their youngest son , who was only four that year , had completely conflated the two holidays , and as we set out on the long ride from the airport to our house he began practicing the Four Questions . " Ma nishtanu ha-lila ha-zeh , " he sang . He had a good memory even then ; now he 's near the top of his medical school class . <p> And so , sometime after eight on the eve of Thanksgiving , this clever little fellow was sitting on his mother 's bony lap , chanting . " We 'll have the four questions next April , " his mother said . He placed his hand over her mouth . <p> My other cousins , smart sons too , sat on either side of Aunt Sylvie in the back seat of our station wagon . I lay on my stomach in the wayback , comfortably sandbagged by my relatives ' five backpacks . <p> " I love the prairie , " said Aunt Sylvie , looking out of the window at the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans is the land that supports them , " ' she remarked . <p> " Emerson , " I guessed , after a while . <p> " De Toqueville , " she told me . <p> " Anu ochlim , " continued my little cousin . <p> Uncle Jack sat in front beside my father . Both men had sparse hair radiating from a bald area . But there the resemblance ended . Though my father 's paunch was noticeable his weight was more or less contained . Uncle Jack was fat-a rumpled , rolling man who smoked several black-market cigars every day . He was wrapped in the odor of cigar as if in priestly robes . When , a few years afterwards , I entered college in Massachusetts , I noticed that all the young women I was thrown in with-the snooty skiers , the performance artists , the revolutionaries-wrinkled their noses when a cigar passed by . But then , not knowing any better , I sniffed Jack 's corona with pleasure . It provided a sweet foresmell of a long holiday weekend with very good leftovers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> My mother had not come to the airport . She was home preparing the sweet potato casserole for tomorrow-basically the same recipe as the Passover tsimmis , but without prunes . Thanksgiving morning she would stuff and roast the turkey . The other dishes she subcontracted . Our perennial guests the doctor and his wife would come with their three young daughters , and the doctor 's wife always offered to bake a dessert . She usually showed up with a couple of store-bought ice cream pies , already drenching their cardboard boxes when she slid them onto the kitchen counter . The accommodator would put them quickly into the freezer . <p> The man next door joined us every year . The woman next door accompanied him sometimes ; at other times she was n't up to it . The man next door was responsible for the wine . Aunt Sylvie and Uncle Jack provided the green tomato relish . They made a batch every summer , and preserved it . I knew that in each of the five backpacks lay a glass jar , like an embryo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the tomato relish . Our current live-in student had gotten up at five that morning to bake the bread , and also to prepare an apple cobbler in case the doctor 's wife forgot her assignment altogether . Then the live-in caught the bus for home . <p> " Ha-lila ha-zeh , colanu masbin , " our entertainer wound up . When we turned into the driveway , we saw my mother standing in the back yard , slim as a child , her hair reflecting the floodlight . Her glasses glinted like lemon slices . She flew to embrace her sister-in-law and sister-in-law 's family . " Michelle does seem to have the hospitality of a Jewess , " one of our bitchy great-aunts had admitted . " She 's to the manna born , ha-ha . " <p> An hour later , after the little boys had been tucked into the live-in 's third-floor room , the adults and I settled in with a couple of six-packs downstairs . Sylvie and my father continued their lifetime intellectual dispute . Uncle Jack stretched out on the sofa and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ankles hooked around its ankles . <p> After a while she announced that she was going to bed . " You too ? " she asked my father . " We have an early date with Tom . " She meant that in the morning my father would hold a big turkey under the kitchen faucet until its cavity filled up with water , and turn it over and drain it , and repeat the bathing a few times , and pat the fellow dry , and fit him into the giant pan . Then my mother would stuff the bird with sausage dressing . She 'd rub the skin with olive oil mixed with rosemary and garlic . My father would put him into the oven . All morning my parents would baste . About half an hour before the meal , while the grown-ups were drinking cocktails in the living room , the accommodator would , we hoped , extract the turkey from the oven and put in the sweet potatoes to warm and spoon the dressing out of the cavity and carve the turkey if he or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . After the main course my father and Uncle Jack tossed and dressed the salad , in two bowls , on the dining table , in front of everybody . Their elbows worked in unison , like television comics from the Golden Years . " Like vaudevillians , really , " Aunt Sylvie had told me . " Vaudeville was the ancestor of television . Television is a throwback to vaudeville . " During the salad course the accommodator , if he or she paid attention to my mother 's neat list of directions , would remove the doctor 's wife 's ice cream pies from the freezer and slice them . <p> " Yes , to bed , " said my father , not budging . Uncle Jack snored . <p> " Who 's tomorrow 's helper ? " <p> My mother said : " His name is Joshi . He sounds Indian or Pakistani on the telephone . " <p> " An Oxbridge accent ? " Sylvie wanted to know . <p> " Not exactly . " My mother considered for a moment , respecting Sylvie 's passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Oxbridge accent , " she decided . " One of my fertility doctors sounded like that . " <p> This dragged the discussion into colonialism , Partition , Nehru , Buddha , E. M. Forster , and the possiblity of an afterlife . <p> My mother went to bed . I did , too . <p> Thanksgiving was cloudy but mild . I woke to the sounds of my cousins scrapping on the third floor . I walked downstairs . No one was in the living room , but there was still a dent on the sofa where Uncle Jack had lain , who knew for how long . " Jack , Jack , " I imagined Aunt Sylvie whispering into his ear , after my father had finally followed my mother to bed . " Jack , Jack . " He murmured but did not stir . His breath smelled magnificently of cigar . He opened his eyes . He pulled her down on top of him , unzipped his fly , and raised her loose dress . I had learned from my best friend-she learned it from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> From the hall I looked into the kitchen . My father was standing at the sink , wrestling with a large pale turkey . My mother was stirring a pot on the stove . I could hear an Orson twin repairing a slate on the porch roof . I went upstairs and showered and did my eyes . I put on a black skirt and a purple sweater and walked the three blocks to my friend 's . " Always the bottom position ? " I asked her . <p> She nodded . " An attempt to mount their mates is fraught with peril , " she explained . " Death by suffocation may ensue . " <p> I was home by noon . Uncle Jack and his sons were kicking a soccer ball on the lawn . Mr. Orson had vanished from the roof but Mr. La Pierre 's truck was parked out in front . He must be trying some new trick with the mice in the walls . <p> The task of setting the table belonged to me . The oldest cousin came in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . He took orders with such seriousness that I figured he meant to sabotage the effort-give one person forks only and another only spoons . But he did exactly as he was told . He even made sure to put the wineglass with the cracked base at my mother 's place . " As soon as this one breaks we 'll get a whole new set , " she 'd told me . <p> We were just finishing when the doorbell rang . <p> " Michal ! " called my mother from upstairs . <p> I opened the door . <p> A slender young man stood there . He was just my height , which was just my mother 's height . His narrow face was the color of cocoa with milk . " Good afternoon , " he said . " My name is Joshi . " <p> " I 'm Michal , " I said . " Come in . " <p> But before either of us could move , a rushing creature hurtled between us-my littlest cousin , headed for the downstairs bathroom . " It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Too late ; the door banged . I led the young man into the kitchen . <p> Within the oven the bird fragrantly roasted . Uncle Jack , standing , rested his rump against the edge of the sink . Every so often he flicked cigar ash toward the disposal . Aunt Sylvie leaned her backside against the counter , her long arms at her side . Their faces were so peaceable that I hesitated to speak . Joshi said nothing . Finally : " This is Joshi , " I began . " He  --  " <p> My cousin burst into the room , again separating the accommodator and me . He wrapped his arms around his father 's thigh . " It wo n't flush ! " <p> Uncle Jack 's free hand ruffled the boy 's hair . <p> " Joshi , " said Aunt Sylvie . " A Tibetan name , I think . " <p> " Nepalese , " he said . " My parents live in Katmandu . " <p> My aunt was strenuously silent . <p> " Let 's go see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son from the room . <p> " Self-sacrifice , teach the cloud to die , " ' Sylvie suddenly remembered . " Teach the earth to thrill , 0 rainbow ! " ' <p> Joshi bowed . <p> Aunt Sylvie said : " Michelle , our hostess , that is , your employer , has gone upstairs to change her clothing . She 'll be down in a few minutes . There are instructions pasted to the refrigerator . This is a traditional and informal American celebration , nothing to make you nervous . Your basic responsibility is to keep people full . There will be plenty of cleaning up . The dishwashing machine usually works for a while . " She opened the oven door and introduced the turkey . It was the color of old brass . Joshi leaned courteously forward . <p> The back door opened . Behind three pastry boxes , one on top of another , drifted the doctor 's wife . Some of her long , faded hair had become entangled with the boxes ' string , and when she placed her contribution on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , profile down , like an aristocrat on the guillotine . <p> " Please do not move , " said Joshi to the doctor 's wife . He unwound her hair from the boxes and released her and thanked her for the pies . " Two blueberries and a lemon meringue , " she said . Joshi opened the oven door and poked a fork into the turkey and saw that it was running with juices . He slid it out of the oven-Aunt Sylvie and the doctor 's wife both backed away-and lifted it onto the counter . He put the sweet potato bake , which had been resting on top of the range , into the oven , and he did the same with a pan of extra stuffing , and he squatted to comfort my youngest cousin , who had re-entered the kitchen , Uncle Jack just behind him . Joshi embraced the child with his right arm . With his left he drew a pail from under the sink and handed it to Jack . " Thank you , " said my uncle . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doorway . <p> Joshi rose . He lowered his lids . Then he raised them . He bowed . " Namas-te , " he said . I salute you , it meant ( Aunt Sylvie said later ) . <p> I saw my mother with Joshi 's eyes . Or maybe I saw her for the first time with my own . Anyway , I saw her : the helter-skelter hair , the glasses that could not dull the violet irises ; the nose of no account ; the wide smile that my father told my uncle he had not gotten used to , not yet , and it 's twenty years next April , Jack . Dad did n't know I was listening , then . Now , Joshi did n't know I was watching . My mother came briskly into the kitchen . She opened the refrigerator door and stuck her whole head inside , as if she meant to chill it . <p> The doctor and his three daughters were breezing through the kitchen . My mother withdrew her head from the refrigerator and closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanned into the hall . The doctor and my mother turned toward the living room . The children ran to the side porch , where they knew they would find a jigsaw puzzle . The front doorbell rang . Joshi unlocked the first jar of tomato relish and at the same time twirled and at the same time vanished . I looked into the hall in time to see him land on his toes . He welcomed the man next door , and the woman next door , who was up to it this year . " Namas-te . " Joshi took several bottles of red wine from the couple . The woman next door grabbed the arm of the man next door and they proceeded into the living room . <p> All adults were now gathered there . All children were on the porch . I returned to the kitchen and settled myself on a high stool . Joshi decanted a bottle of wine and gave me some in a jelly glass . He set out bowls of tomato relish , carved the turkey , and sliced the home-baked bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cone which he then returned to his back pocket . <p> What competence , to anticipate our need for spices . What eyes  --  like black tulips . " Where is Nepal ? " I asked . <p> " North of India , south of Tibet . " <p> " Are there mountains there ? " <p> " The Himalayas , " he modestly answered . " Forests and rivers , too . Yaks and leopards . Beggars and houses of prayer . My home . " He said these things in his soft Oxbridge-taught way , working all the while . He told me that there was a great autumnal festival , Dasain , and a remarkable poet , Devkota , and that slaves had not been emancipated until 1927 . " The language is not a tonal one , but emphasis is important . " he said . He told me that he was studying political economy at our wonderful university , on a fellowship . " In Nepal we have greenfinches and hawks and also little musk deer . " <p> " I would like to see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I wanted to suggest that we leave immediately , but instead I wondered aloud about lions . <p> " We have yeti , " he replied . " Will you please tell Madame Michelle that my preparations are completed . " <p> I tottered into the hall . Feet were sticking out of the downstairs bathroom . I recognized them as belonging to one of the Orsons . In the living room Aunt Sylvie was telling the doctor about neurotransmitters . The woman from next door , already pink faced , was listening . Her husband and Uncle Jack and the doctor 's wife were laughing about something . My parents , side by side in front of the fireplace , were talking to a big man in a lumber jacket . It was Mr. Cantabile the gardener . My mother held an armful of roses-not stemmed ones from the florist , thorned ones . They were wrapped in newspaper . " - that bush of mine manages to keep going , " Mr. Cantabile was saying . " Hello , bella Michal . And tonight the temperature is dropping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , I thought , and one for you , because I know you love wild roses-and you , Professor , too , of course . " He turned to go and encountered Joshi in the archway . <p> " Namas-te , " said Joshi . <p> " Likewise , " said Mr. Cantabile . <p> " Dinner is served , " said Joshi . <p> I would like to say that my mother seemed particularly relaxed during that Thanksgiving meal that was , for once , expertly served . But my mother usually seemed relaxed-maybe three times in the previous fifteen years she had expressed agitation . There was the time Dad went into the hospital with pneumonia ; her eyes looked like raccoons ' for several days . There was the summer I cracked my head on the diving board trying to do a back flip and all night long had to be woken up so that a light could be shined into my pupils to make sure they were still the same size . Each time my mother whitely grimaced behind the flashlight , terrifying me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York dropped a thousand feet in half a second , and chicken breasts bounced off reading lights . We were on the right side of the aisle . My mother , in the seat near the window , reached her left hand across me toward Dad . She grabbed his seat belt first , and then his regular belt , and then he dislodged her fingers from the leather and held her hand between his two palms . I watched him do it . I looked at her . She did n't say anything , just kept her hand in Dad 's and stared at me over her shoulder , her head at an awkward angle , her eyes spilling indigo behind her glasses . People were yelling . The plane shuddered again . She withdrew her left hand from Dad 's gentle hold and slid her arm back . On its journey it caressed my belly . She gripped her own chair ; and now , reaching across with her right arm , she could face me comfortably , if comfort had anything to do with the experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutch-and then she kissed me , full on the mouth . It was my first kiss , actually . But even in that moment of probable farewell , my mother was n't really agitated . She just was n't what you 'd call composed . The plane stopped shaking , and we landed safely a little while later . <p> During the preparation of the salad my youngest cousin began to cry . Jack and my father stopped the synchronized tossing . " If you like , " Jack said to his son , smiling . <p> " Ma nishtanu ha-lila ha-zeh , " the boy sang , sniffling at first . " Micol ha-lilot . " He was recovering . " Shebicol ha-lilot anu ochlin hametz umatzah . " <p> He looked around for the matzo and saw only the remains of the live-in 's bread . His face grew puzzled , and he frowned like an old man ; and suddenly wisdom flashed . A different holiday ! Just as they had told him ! Frantic , he turned toward his mother . <p> " Shebicol ha-lilot anu- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy went on . Next Thanksgiving , I foresaw , he 'd be wearing a feathered headdress . <p> Joshi stood against the wall during the performance , awarding respect and reverence to this song which must be part of the traditional American celebration . <p> " Colanu masbin , " my cousin finished . <p> " Amen , " agreed the doctor . He smiled across the table at his bewildered daughters , making sure they did n't feel abandoned . <p> The brothers-in-law continued preparing the salad . Joshi continued moving from dining room to kitchen and from kitchen to dining room . We ate the salad . Joshi removed the salad plates . I was sitting at the far end of the table , and I noticed a draft . I got up and went into the hall . The front door was slightly open . Maybe the Orson had forgotten to close it . Or maybe Elijah too had muddled the holidays . <p> I returned to the table and saw that people were changing places as they always did during the unbuttoned time before dessert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to my mother 's and sat down beside her like a warder . <p> " - the end of April , " Aunt Sylvie was saying to the woman next door . " A few weeks after Passover . " <p> " A nice season to have a baby , " said the woman next door in her thick voice . <p> Uncle Jack was beaming in a prosperous way . At least he was rich in children . I noticed that the ends of the doctor 's wife 's hair were moist with gravy . I noticed too that my mother 's wineglass had finally broken along its fault line . She had wrapped a napkin loosely around the glass and its separated crescent ; later , I was sure , she would wind both pieces in sheets of newspaper , maybe the very newspaper that had cradled Mr. Cantabile 's roses , and would bury the little package in the outside trash barrel . The roses themselves stood starkly in a vase on the windowsill . " The art of pleasing , " ' Dad was saying to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> My cousin looked unimpressed . <p> " Hazlitt , " cited Dad . <p> " Has lit the candles ? " grinned the boy . <p> Joshi brought in the desserts : the live-in 's cobbler and the doctor 's wife 's three supermarket pies . He had put the bigger of the blueberry pies on a platter and the smaller on top of the first , but upside down . A mushy melding had occurred , and thin rivulets spurted and leaked . On the flat shelf made by the upended bottom of the top blueberry pie Joshi had placed the lemon meringue , a miniature Himalaya . He had set the thing on fire , who knows how , so that mountains burned while blue rivers streamed . He put this offering on the table in front of my mother . " Thank you , " she said . <p> After some seconds the flame went out . Immediately another fire blazed-the Waldstein , on our piano , bravely mangled by young La Pierre , who had shown up as usual because it was Thursday . Passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uncle Jack lit a cigar , that aromatic cylinder that I would learn to shudder at . My father lit a cigar , and I wondered whether he too sometimes took the bottom place in the marital bed . He smiled at my mother . She smiled at him . I looked down at the wineglass and its fragment nestled together : an envious little creche . I watched Joshi serve each guest a thin wedge of triple decker pie and a slice of cobbler . I wonder now : did he see us as personifications of sins-gluttony , pride , lust , jealousy ; and of evil habits-drink and tobacco ; and of disorder-depression , hypercerebrality , dumb family planning ? Or did he see us as fifteen people , sixteen counting the pianist , individually and collectively reaching a high level of accommodation-who knows , maybe even the highest ? " O rainbow-teach the earth to thrill ! " <p>
