Section : PART 1 ; HISTORY &; POLITICS <p> HISTORY IS IN MOTION , and those moving with it are so caught up that they can not always see its broad outlines . Like soldiers in battle , they are concerned with objectives rather than principles . Who are these soldiers ? They are you . And what are the principles ? If you search the past , hindsight makes them easy to see , but in the brightness of the present they are almost invisible . Still , it is possible to catch a fleeting glimpse of them , even if only as alterations in contrast . <p> In that spirit , consider the two paradigms that follow , not as you would two spirited debaters but rather two paintings hanging at opposite ends of a gallery . You are in the middle , bathed in natural light , forced by history to judge their color and attraction . I. August 2016 , California <p> YOU ARE A DIRECTOR OF A FIRM that supplies algorithms for the detection and restoration of damaged molecular memories in organic computation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degradation of atomic lattices in gallium arsenide nanorobotics , but the greater promise of organic replication and the lure of photon interlinking led you in a new direction . <p> You raised $2 billion , most of which was devoted to the purchase of computers and laser armature looms for the growth and manipulation of organic components . Though your entire company is housed in a single 40,000-square-foot facility and has only 90 employees , it records assets of $9 billion and annual revenue of $32 billion . <p> All transactions are accomplished through data links  --  licensing , sales , billing , remittances , collections , investments . A customer can make a purchase , receive your product , and pay you as fast as he can speak orders to his computer . As your product begins immediately to work for him , the money you 've earned begins immediately to work for you , in , perhaps , Czech dormitory bonds that compound interest hourly . <p> You go to your headquarters mainly for picnics , and otherwise work at home , as does your wife , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has never been . In her study and in yours are giant screens that produce three-dimensional images so vivid that they appear to be real . Your best friend has grown rich writing the software that serves as your secretary . The preparation of documents is done by voice in another program , and the secretary concentrates on planning , accounting , arranging your schedule , and called calls but what are now called apparitions . <p> You instruct the secretary to allow your wife 's apparition to override all others . She is at a beach in Indonesia , where you will shortly join her . Recently , you and she have quarreled . In virtual sex , in which you both wear corneal lenses that create a perfect illusion of whomever you might want , she discovered that you were entertaining not a commercial prostitutional apparition but an old girlfriend . Hence her early departure for Indonesia . <p> But this is August , the season of vacations , and you and she are bound to make up . You are to take a one and one-half hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several days at the beach in a primitive resort with no screens . Still , you have a of email despite a recent tightening of your rejection protocols and a new investment in automated reply software , the chief disadvantage of which is that , when in conversation with other automated reply software , it tends to get overly enthusiastic . You were dismayed lately when you discovered that it and another ARS were building a golf course in Zimbabwe , but there is software for controlling it , and software for controlling the software that controls this , and so on and so forth . <p> Though seventy-five messages remain , you must catch your plane , so you instruct your screen to send them to your notebook . You 'll take levels one and two coded personal apparitions as well , in the air and even on the winding track that leads to the Indonesian resort . <p> As you wait in San Francisco International Airport ( having floated there in the Willie Brown Memorial Blimp ) , you read in your notebook . There are no bookstores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather-bound portfolio is an uplink that gives you access to everything ever published or logged , and in any format . You can call for a dual-language text of Marcus Aurelius , or the latest paper in Malay on particle acceleration . Your reading can be interrupted by the appearance of a friend in your portfolio , a look at the actual weather in Djakarta , a film clip of Lyndon Johnson 's inaugural , or , for that matter , anything , summoned by voice , available instantaneously , and billed to your central account . <p> " Go to my files , " you might say as you sit in the airport , " and get me everything I 've said in the last five years about Descartes . I made a remark with a metaphor about the law , coordinates , and virtual prisons . When you get it , put it on the screen in blue . Take a letter to Schultz and file a copy at home and with the office . " <p> But as you issue , you must also receive , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture to feel like paper , and is as buff or white as flax or cotton , you miss the days of faxes , when you could hold the paper in your hands and when things were a little slower , but you ca n't go back to them , you ca n't fall behind , you ca n't pass up an opportunity , and if you do n't respond quickly at all times somebody else will beat you to it , even if you have no idea what it is . <p> The world flows at increasingly faster and faster speeds . You must match them . When you were a child , it was not quite that way . But your father and grandfather did not have the power to make things transparent , to be , instantaneously , here or there without constraint . They , unlike you , were the prisoners of mundane tasks . They wrote with pens , they did addition , they waited endlessly for things that come to you instantly , they had far less than do you , and they bowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace , the giddy , continual acceleration . Though what is new may not be beautiful , it is marvelously compelling , and your life is lived with the kind of excitement that your fore-bears knew only in battle and with the ease of which they could only dream . II . August 1906 , Lake Como , Italy <p> YOU ARE AN ENGLISH politician , a member of Parliament suffering patiently between cabinet posts , on holiday in Italy . In the two days it has taken to reach your destination , you have fallen completely out of touch , although you did manage to pick up a day-old Paris newspaper in Turin . The Times will be arriving a week late , as will occasional letters from your colleagues and your business agent . Your answers to most of their queries will arrive in London only slightly before you yourself return at the end of the month . <p> The letters you receive are in ecru and blue envelopes , with crests , stamps reminiscent of the Italian miniaturists , and , sometimes , varicolored wax seals over ribbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penmanship gives away their authors and may be the cause for comfort , dread , amusement , curiosity , or disgust . And , as you read , following the idiosyncratic , expressive , and imprecise swells and dips like a sailor in a small boat on an agitated sea , the hand of your correspondent reinforces his thoughts , as do the caesuras rhythmically arrayed in conjunction with the need to dip the pen . <p> Some of your younger colleagues use fountain pens , and this you can detect in lines that do not thin before a pause load of ink . Now and then , a letter will arrive , typewritten . This you associate with the telegraph office , official documents , and things that lean in the direction of function far enough to exclude almost completely the presence of grace  --  not grace in the religious sense , but in the sense of that which is beautiful and balanced . <p> You will receive an average of one letter every two days , fifteen or sixteen in all , and will write slightly more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on holiday , and wish that you were not . Half the letters will be related to governance , the other half to family and friendship . An important letter , written by the prime minister eight days before its reception , will elicit from you a one-page response composed over a period of an hour and three-quarters and copied twice before it assumes final form , for revision and so you may have a record . You will mail it the next morning when you pass the post office during your walk . The prime minister will receive his answer , if he is in London , two weeks after his query . He will consider you prompt . <p> During your holiday you will climb hills , visit chapels , attend half a dozen formal dinners , and read many books , several thousand pages all told . If upon reading a classical history you come across a Greek phrase with an unfamiliar word you will have to wait until the library opens , walk there by the lakeside , and consult a Greek lexicon : one and one-half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lake and mountains , you will make notes as you read , and some of these will be incorporated in your letters . Most will languish until your return to London . By the time you look at them in a new season , only a few will seem worthy , and the rest you will gratefully discard . <p> During August you will hear music seventeen times . Five times it will have been produced by actual musicians , twelve times by a needle tracing the grooves in a cylinder and echoing songs in extremely melancholy imperfection through a flowerlike horn . You will attend the theater once , in Italian , but you will spend many hours reading Henry V and The Tempest ( which you read each summer ) , and several plays by George Bernard Shaw . In your mind 's eye you will see the richest scenes and excitements known to man , and your dreams will echo what you 've read , in colors like those of gemstones , but diamond-clear , and with accompaniment in sound as if from a symphony orchestra . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton , silk , linen , and wool . You and your wife hired a rowboat and went to a distant outcropping of granite and pine . No one could be seen , so you stripped down to the cotton and swam in the cold fresh water . Her frock clung to her in a way that awoke in you extremely strong sexual desire ( for someone your age ) , and though you made no mention of it in the bright sunlight on the ledge above the lake , later that night your memory of her rising from sparkling water into sparkling sunlight made you lively in a way that was much appreciated . <p> Indeed , your memory has been trained with lifelong diligence . You know tens of thousands of words in your own language , in Latin , Greek , French , and German . You are haunted by declensions , conjugations , rules , exceptions , and passages that linger many years after the fact . Calculations , too , built your character in that you were forced to work elaborate equations in painstaking and edifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made to study not only concept but craft . And , yes , in your letter to the prime minister , you repeated  --  with honorable alteration  --  a remark you made some time ago regarding Descartes . At first you could not remember it , but then you did , because you had to . <p> Necessity you find to be your greatest ally , an anchor of stability , a pier off of which , sometimes , you may dive . Discipline and memory are strengths that in their exercise open up worlds . The lack of certain things when you want them makes your desire keener and you better rewarded when eventually you get them . <p> You can not imagine a life without deprivations , and without the compensatory power of the imagination , moving like a linnet with apparent industry and certain grace , to strengthen the spirit in the face of want . Your son went out to India , and you have neither seen him nor heard his voice for two years . Thus , you have learned once more the perfection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have turned , and for the best . It was like that when you were courting your wife . Sometimes you did not see her for weeks or months . It sharpened your desire and deepened your love . <p> You have learned to enjoy the attribute of patience in itself , for it slows time , honors tranquility , and lets you savor a world in which you are clearly aware that your passage is but a brief candle . <p> I MUST CONFESS THAT I AM deeply predisposed in favor of the second paradigm , and in my view the vast difference between the two is attributable not to some inexplicable superiority of morals , custom , or culture , but rather to facts and physics , two things that , in judging our happiness , we tend to ignore in favor of an evaporative tangle of abstractions . <p> Unlike machines , we are confined to an exceedingly narrow range of operations . Though we may marvel at the apparent physical diversity of the human race , it is , given its billions of representatives , astonishingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above seven feet . Not a one is or has been over nine feet . And the exceedingly low standard deviation in form is immense compared to that There is no escape from the fact that after a set exposure to radiation ; absent a given number of minutes of oxygen ; at , above , or below a particular temperature ; or subject to a specific G-force , we will expire . No one will ever run the mile in two minutes , crawl through a Cheerio , or memorize the Encyclopaedia Britannica . <p> Because of our physical constraints we require a specific environment and a harmony in elements that relate to us and of which we are often unaware . The Parthenon is a very pleasing building , and Mozart 's Fifth Piano Concerto a very pleasing work , because each makes use of proportions , relations , and variations that go beyond subjective preference , education , and culture into the realm of universal appeal conditioned by universal human requirements and constraints . <p> A life lived with these understood , even if vaguely , will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . When expanding one 's powers , as we are in the midst of now doing by many orders of magnitude in the mastery of information , we must always be aware of our natural limitations , mortal requirements , and humane preferences . <p> For example , the Englishman at Lake Como , unlike his modern counterpart , is graciously limited in time and space . Because the prime minister is in London or at Biarritz , the prime minister can not sit down with him and discuss . In fact , during his fictional stay , only one of his colleagues visited , and spent several hours on the terrace with him in the bright but cool sunshine . All others were kept away by the constraints of time and distance . <p> The man of ' 16 , on the other hand , is no longer separated from anyone . Any of his acquaintances may step into his study at will  --  possibly twenty , thirty , forty , or fifty a day . If not constantly interrupted , he is at least continually subject to interruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commensurately . No matter how urgent or pressing a matter , the prime minister can not sit down with the tranquil politician . No matter how petty a matter , a coworker can appear to the man of ' 16 ... in a trice . Screening devices or not , the modern paradigm is one of time filled to the brim . Potential has always been the overlord of will , and the man of the first paradigm finds himself distracted and drawn in different directions a hundred times a day , whereas the British statesman is prodded from without only once or twice . <p> Were we gods , we might be able to live well without rest and contemplation , but we are not and we can not . Whereas our physical capacities are limited , those of the machine are virtually unlimited . As the capabilities of the machine are extended , we can use it  --  we imagine  --  to supplement our own in ways that will not strain our humanity . Had we no appetite or sin , this might be true , but our desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital revolution has quickly progressed , we have not had time to develop the protocols , manners , discipline , and ethics adequate for protecting us from our newly augmented powers . <p> The history of this century has been , as much as anything else , the process of encoding information : at first analog , in photographic emulsions , physical and magnetic patterns in needle grooves or on tapes , waves in packets blurted into the atmosphere , or in the action of X-rays recording paths of varying difficulty through tissues of various densities on plates of constant sensitivity . With binary coding , electrons as messengers , and the hard-fought mathematical adaptation necessary for control , we can now do almost everything with information . We may , for example , look through billions of pages in an instant , or process and match data fast enough so that a cruise missile can make a " mental " picture of the terrain it overflies at least as impressive as that of an eagle . <p> And because potential has always been the overlord of will , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , words have been gradually displaced by images . The capacious , swelling streams of information have brought little change in quality and vast overflows of quantity . In this they are comparable to the ornamental explosions of the baroque , when a corresponding richness of resource found its outlet mainly in decorating the leaner body of a previous age . <p> All the king 's horses and all the king 's men of multimedia can not improve upon a single line of Yeats . One does not need transistors , clean alternating current , spring-loaded keys , and ten-million-hour " programs " for writing a note or a love letter  --  and yet this is how we are beginning to write notes and love letters , going even to the extreme of doing so on complicated electronic pads that tediously strain to imitate a sheet of paper and fail for want of simplicity . <p> If by now you think that I am decrying the digital revolution , that I am a sort of Luddite Percy Dovetonsils who would recommend for you and your children the cold water , wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had better think again . For I understand and have always understood that the heart of Western civilization is not the abdication of powers but rather meeting the challenge of their use . And , of course , it would take a person of less than doltish imagination not to be attracted by the wonders and aware of the benefits of all this . <p> The British statesman of the second paradigm might well have lost a son or daughter to a disease that could have been detected early and with precision by computerized tomography or any of the other digitally dependent diagnostic techniques of modern medicine . The Titanic , six years in the future , might not have gone down  --  with him aboard , perhaps  --  had real-time thermal maps of the North Atlantic been available to its captain . And so on : you know the litany if you have read an IBM annual report . <p> The impossibility of abdication is also due to the necessity of racing with the genie after it has exited the bottle . Although antediluvian nuclear protestors have not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong track . Nuclear weapons are now small enough , reliable enough , simulable enough , and widespread enough to be a rather mundane constant in calculations of the military balance . The guaranteed action and volatility is in command , control , communications , intelligence , and guidance . Digitally dependent advances will enable submunitions scattered in great numbers over a future battlefield to hide , wait , seek , fight , and maneuver . For example , rather than a platoon of tank-killing infantry , a flight of submunitions will someday be dropped or fly with little detection very far behind enemy lines , where it will hide in the treetops or the brush and await patiently for as long as required the approach of an appropriate enemy target , such as a tank , which it will then dutifully pursue , engage , and destroy , its reflexes as fast as light . <p> With the passage of each day , a first nuclear strike becomes more and more feasible . The possibility of real-time terminal guidance as a gift from satellites to maneuverable reentry vehicles makes any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarines , nuclear stability 's ace in the hole , will no longer be secure bastions for nuclear weapons , as thermal and radar imaging from satellites picks up surface perturbations upwelling from their undersea tracks , and as the panoply of antisubmarine warfare is refined , empowered , sensitized , and mounted on ballistic missiles that will be able to reach any area of ocean within minutes . <p> It is possible that in some war of the not-so-distant future a combatant will electronically seize control of enemy command structures and direct his opponent 's arsenal onto his opponent . Eventually , all battles will be entirely computational . The " arms competition " of this sort has already begun . To step out of it at this point would be to lose it , and , with it , everything else . <p> THE ATTRACTION IS STRONG , the need is real , the marvels - marvelous , and there is no going back . The speed with which all is taking place is almost a self-organizing principle . Like many changes in history , it seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it . then do we need an ethos , a set of principles , and an etiquette specifically fashioned for the rest of this revolution that will ( I predict ) follow with stunning force the mere prologue through which we are now living ? <p> Of course , one always needs ethics , principles , and etiquette , but now more than ever do we need them as we leave the age of brick and iron . For the age of brick and iron , shock as it might have been to Wordsworth , was friendlier to mankind than is the digital age , more appropriate to the natural pace set by the beating of the human heart , more apprehensible in texture to the hand , better suited in color to the eye , and , in view of human frailty , more forgiving in its inertial stillness . <p> Put quite simply , the life of the British statesman was superior because he was allowed rest and reflection , his contemplation could seek its own level , and his tranquility was unaccelerated . While he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many practical necessities , today most Americans have similar resources and freedoms , and yet they , like their contemporaries in even the most exalted positions , have chosen a different standard , closer to that of the first paradigm . <p> The life of the exemplary statesman , then dependent upon a large staff of underpaid servants , and children working in mines and mills ( if not in Lancashire , then certainly in India ) , is now available to almost anyone . Even if in one 's working hours one does not sit in the cabinet room at No. 10 Downing Street , one can have a quiet refuge , dignified dress , paper , a fountain pen , books , postage , Mozart with astonishing fidelity and ease , an excellent diet , much time to one 's self , the opportunity to travel , a few nice pieces of furniture and decoration , medical care far beyond what the British statesman might have dreamed of , and , yes , a single-malt scotch in a crystal glass , for less than the average middle-class income . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see how it is that people with a strong sense of what they want , need , and do not require can live like kings of a sort if they exhibit the appropriate discipline and self-restraint . <p> Requisite , I believe , for correcting the first paradigm until it approximates the second , and bringing to the second ( without jeopardizing it ) the excitements and benefits of the first , are the discipline , values , and clarity of vision that tend to flourish as we grapple with necessity and to disappear when by our ingenuity we float free of it . <p> The law itself can be mobilized to protect the privacy and dignity of the individual according to the original constitutional standard of the founders and what they might expect . Even now , that standard has been violated enough to cried democracy , which depends first and foremost upon the sanctity of individual rights . As if they could foresee the unforeseeable , the founders laid down principles that have served to prevent the transformation of individual to manipulable quantity , of citizen to subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit of this . Convenience is , finally , nothing , and even destructive . The standard must be restored , for it is slipping too fast . Bluntly , there are practices and procedures that legislation must end , and databases now extant that it must destroy , in a deliberate and protective step back . Revolutions and revolutionaries tear down walls . Though some walls are an affront to human dignity , others protect it . I do not want my life history in the hands of either Craig Livingstone or Walt Disney , thank you very much . <p> Quite apart from the reach of the law is the voluntary reformation of educational practices . Is the reader aware of the immense proportion of this country 's academic energies devoted to the study of off-the-shelf software ? Terrified lest their children be computer illiterate , lemming parents have pushed the schools into a computer frenzy in which students spend years learning to use Windows and WordPerfect . This is much like Sesame Street , which , instead of waiting until a child is five and teaching him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into him during his underdeveloped infancy . But while numbers will remain the same , fifth-graders will , when they get to graduate school , have no contact with Windows 95 . The " teaching " of computer in the schools may be likened to a business academy in the 1920s founded for the purpose of teaching the telephone : " When you hear the bell , pick up the receiver , place it thusly near your face , and say ' Hello ? ' " <p> Basic computer literacy is a self-taught subject requiring no more than a week . Ordinary literacy , however , requires twenty years or more , and that is only a beginning . And yet the schools are making of these two-unrelated things a vast and embarrassing spoonerism . In the schools computers shoed be tools for the study of other subjects , not a subject in themselves . The masters of the digital world will be , not today 's students who will have spent their high school years learning Lotus 1-2-3 , but those who will guide the future of computation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are adults , having devoted hard study to physics , chemistry , and mathematics . <p> In the same vein , but with almost biblical implications , is the necessity of making certain distinctions . Most multimedia is appalling for several reasons . It endeavors to do the integrative work that used to be the province of the intellect , and that , if it is not in fact accomplished by the intellect , is of absolutely no value . It fails to distinguish between entertainment and education , style and substance , image and fact . It integrates promiscuously , blurring in the addled minds that it addles the differences between things that are different . It removes as far as it possibly can the element of labor from learning , which is comparable , in my view , to making a world without gravity , drinking a milk shake without milk , or living in an iron lung . <p> Whenever man opens a new window of power he imagines that he can do without the careful separations , distinctions , and determinations mandated by the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does this he suffers a terrible degradation that casts him back even as he imagines himself hurtling forward . <p> Put simply , I want the O.E.D . on my computer , I want everything in the Library of Congress , I want great search engines , fuzzy logic , and programs that do statistical analysis , but I do not want multiple-choice television programs , and neither should you , for the good of us all . I 'm not sure if I want email , but I 'm certain that I do not want my contact with my fellow man to proceed mainly through his imagination  --  no matter how precise  --  in the fluorescence behind a glass plate . An example I might cite is that if you sail you really need wind and water : the idea and depiction of them are not sufficient . So with human presence : reality and actuality have their attractions and advantages . <p> In regard to this  --  the question of man and his image  --  whereas the Englishman has the exquisite memory of his wife emerging in wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alpine sunshine , and whereas his relations with her must be based on subtlety and restraint , the man of ' 16 on his way to Indonesia will be able to graft by virtual reality any image he pleases onto the tactile base of his wife 's body . This and its variants have been in the dreams of mankind at least since Leda , and Pygmalion , and sex is undoubtedly responsible for much of the momentum of virtual reality . <p> Many varieties of sensual manipulation will come to pass , and will be promoted as ways to refresh and save marriage , but they will , if they are embraced , entirely destroy marriage . The saving graces and fragile institutions of our humanity depend upon our humanity itself , which in turn depends absolutely upon the rejection and discipline of many of our appetites . We have many a resolution that separates us from the other animals , many a custom , practice , and taboo , and if we do away with these in the pursuit of power or the imitation of time-and-space-flouting divinity , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT YOU HAVE MADE is indeed wonderful , powerful , and great , and it has hardly begun . But you have not brought to it the discipline , the anticipation , or the clarity of vision that it , like any vast augmentation in the potential of humankind , demands . You have been too enthusiastic in your welcome of it , and not wary enough . Some of you have become arrogant and careless , and , quite frankly , too many of you at the forefront of this revolution lack any guiding principles whatsoever or even the urge to seek them out . In this , of course , you are not alone . Nor are you the first . But you must . You must fit this revolution to the needs and limitations of man , with his delicacy , dignity , and mortality always in mind . Having accelerated tranquility , you must now find a way to slow it down . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By MARK HELPRIN <p> <p> Mark Helprin , a senior fellow of the Hudson Institute and contributing editor for the Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force .
