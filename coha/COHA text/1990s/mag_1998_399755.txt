When Chad runs ' from gang violence . in the city , he finds the country has its own dangers . When will his running end ? Photograph // CHAD DRUMMOND shifted both feet in the stirrups . His mother had forgotten to provide boots when she sent him out of the city to the safety of his uncle 's Texas ranch . Unfortunately , even extra socks could n't make wearing his cousin 's old boots comfortable . On or off a horse . " Gallop ! " Deke yelled . " That cat 's streaking for Rocky Bluff . If it gets there , we 'll lose it . " Cantering behind Deke , Chad tried judging the distance to the purple-hazed rocks ahead . His cousin 's brief sighting of a mountain lion at the shallow river crossing had given their ride a new direction . One Chad did n't like . He shivered . Without a hint of spring , the ever-blowing wind cut through his jacket , hat and jeans . March was as chilling here as it was back East . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He leaned forward and risked urging Nugget to go faster . Half an hour later Deke slowed so Chad could catch up . " No trail I can see , " Deke said . " That cat 's probably climbed where we ca n't follow except on foot . " " Why are you so sure it killed your calves ? " Chad asked . " Is n't a mountain lion innocent until proven guilty ? " " Not out here . First time in years we 've lost calves in a week . Seeing that cat is proof enough for me . And since Dad 's in Dallas , I 'm responsible . " " Ca n't Charlie track it ? " Chad said . " He 's told me his story about the bear at least 50 times . Let 's ask all the hands to help . " But , bitterly , Chad knew it was wasted breath . One thing he 'd learned in six weeks : Deke feared nothing . " By morning that cat could be killing more calves . We 'll tie the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , we 'll go home . I 'm not crazy enough to climb Rocky Bluff at night . " While Deke talked he wrapped his mount 's reins around a mesquite bush . Chad tied Nugget close by . " Well , I 'm not crazy enough to walk in these boots , " Chad declared . " I brought my sneakers . " " Mistake . Boots protect you from cactus . Or worse things . " Deke lifted his rifle and canteen from his horse before striding away . " Protection from blisters suits me , " Chad muttered . He already had an ulcer that doctors said might be caused by anxiety and fear . Who needed sore feet too ? But how could Deke understand fear ? He could handle anything . Chad had experienced too much in the city he could n't handle . For half a mile he followed Deke , glad he 'd changed footwear . He did n't see a single cactus on the rocky incline that soon grew steeper . Chad slid on loose rocks as often as he advanced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some perched precariously atop smaller ones . Chad was wondering which way to go when Deke 's voice boomed from above . " Chad ? Hold it . I 'm coming down . A cat could hide up here forever . Besides , it 'll be dark in another hour . " Chad muttered under his breath : " Oh great , better smart late than never . " He hoped his relief did n't show . He 'd come only because he did n't dare let Deke out of his sight . But his ears , not his eyes , signaled trouble . A choked cry . A metallic clatter as Deke 's rifle bounced off rocks . Weak moans . It seemed eons before Chad could steady his shaking legs . " Deke ? You O.K. ? " His answer was a louder groan . Chad froze , waiting to feel the 200-pound impact of a furious mountain lion . A full minute later he realized he 'd heard groans , not snarls . Creeping between rocks he saw Deke , head and back against a boulder , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chad reached for Deke 's discarded boot , feeling foolish for doing so . It was just that holding Deke 's boot beat looking at a broken ankle . Photograph // " I thought the cat got you , " Chad blurted . " Might yet , " Deke mumbled . " Rifle 's slid into a crevice . Help me find it . " One arm over Chad 's shoulder , Deke hopped a short distance and lowered himself full length to see better . Then , gasping , he rolled away . His pale face shone with sweat . Seeing Deke 's glazed eyes stare into the crevice , Chad thought the pain must be unbearable . Then Deke motioned for Chad to help him stand and Chad felt him tremble . " Ca n't reach your rifle ? " Chad said . " I 'll get it for you . " Deke shuddered as he shook his head . " Noooooo , " he moaned . " It fell in a rattlesnake den . Must be 50 or a hundred of ' em crawling all over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a city zoo . He could n't visualize so many of them together in a pile . He tried to define his own rush of feelings . Mixed horror , recognition , and finally , relief . Deke was n't totally fearless after all . Photograph // " Got to move , " Deke whispered . " Help me out of these rocks . Then you 'd better ride for the ranch . Tell Charlie to bring the pickup . " " Me ? " Chad could n't believe it . " I can hardly stay on a horse , Deke , and there are n't any direction signs . The horses I might be able to find . The ranch is impossible . " The burning feeling in Chad 's stomach could n't compare with the pain of a broken ankle . Still , it hurt . His insides knotted like ropes . " I 'm lucky you 're with me , " Deke gasped as they inched past rocks . " Listen , Chad . Nobody knows where we are . Night 's coming and even Charlie ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopping . " I 'm serious . A mountain lion is prowling somewhere close by , and I do n't have a rifle . Ever spent a long night waiting to be pounced on ? " " Yes , " Chad nodded . " Before I came here . Felt like that day and night for about five months . " " Well , if you want to talk about it later , I 'll listen . Right now go for help . " " Can you ride if I bring Thunder and Nugget closer ? " Deke managed a slight grin . " You can bet I 'd try . But it 'll be dark by the time you reach the horses . Trust me , Nugget and Thunder will take you home . They like the meals there . " Chad removed the silver chain he 'd worn around his neck for months . " Here , take this police whistle . It 's good in cities for scaring bad cats away . Blow hard every few minutes . " " Yeah , and maybe the cops will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chad this time . Was n't running what he did best ? His mind churned faster than his legs , remembering what had happened five months ago . He and a friend were jumped on the street for refusing to join a gang . He had run while his friend got his arm broken and six slash wounds that needed stitches . Sure , Chad thought mockingly , I 'm a champion runner . Running away again . By the time he reached the horses , Chad was breathing hard . Nugget nuzzled his ear as he reached for the canteen . He could barely see it . He wished for street lamps and neon signs . He cast one last look back at Rocky Bluff . A movement against the skyline turned Chad as cold as the water spilling from his raised canteen . The cat . Leaping high above the spot where Deke waited . Faintly then , in near darkness , Chad heard the police whistle . Springing to Thunder 's side , Chad searched the saddlebag for the hatchet and matches Deke had packed . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesquite tree . Wheezing for breath , he hacked two branches off for a splint . He left some twigs on a third stick . Returning to Nugget 's side , he yanked off his shoes , peeled off the extra pair of socks and tied them around the end of the third stick . Nugget snorted . Chad patted his neck and pulled on his shoes . " We 're going back for Deke . All we have to do is use our ears . And our lungs . " With the sticks tied to Thunder 's saddle , Chad clutched both horses ' reins and led them into darkness . " We 're coming , Deke . Blow that whistle ! " Over the creaking of harness , Chad thought he heard the whistle again . He shouted several times : " Keep it up ! Blow , blow , blow ! " Guiding the horses farther to the right , Chad stumbled between them , yelling often to make their progress noisier . Surely a mountain lion would choose to run too ? When Deke 's happy shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three to set his torch ablaze . He propped it near Deke 's side and grinned . " Streetlight , anyone ? Now let 's get you on Thunder . Because , trust me , for us , running is not an option ! " <p>
