Question : What is the difference between the Soviet Union and the U.S. ? <P> Answer : In the U.S. , Gorbachev would probably be elected President . <P> Popularly elected he was not , but Mikhail Gorbachev nevertheless swore himself in last week as the first real President the U.S.S.R. has ever had . As the parliamentarians at the third session of the Congress of People 's Deputies rose to their feet , Gorbachev walked from his seat to a small table by a red hammer-and-sickle flag . Placing his right hand on a copy of the Soviet constitution , he intoned , " I solemnly swear to serve faithfully the peoples of our country , to strictly abide by the constitution of the U.S.S.R. , to guarantee the rights and freedoms of our citizens and conscientiously fulfill the high duties entrusted to me as President of the Soviet Union . " <P> For seven decades Soviets have heard countless promises from their Communist leaders , but never an official oath to honor the constitution . The document in question was an outdated product of the Brezhnev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers that go along with it , were won by parliamentary , not popular , vote . But there was no denying the fact that almost five years to the day after he assumed the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party , Gorbachev had engineered nothing less than a coup d'etat , effectively ending his party 's monopoly on power . Said he : " We all can feel the first real results of political change . A system of genuine people power is being created and the groundwork laid for building a country governed by law . " <P> Some Soviets complained that Gorbachev 's accession to executive power hardly resembled true democracy . Others grumbled that his political changes have brought precious little improvement to a distressed economy . Gorbachev would probably win election if tested at the polls  --  for want of a real alternative . Yet despite his sweeping new powers , he faces a populace disenchanted with his failure to fulfill the promises he has made and increasingly skeptical that he is moving radically enough to do so . <P> During the four-day congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date of his policies . Economic reformer Nikolai Shmelev complained that " as far as the economy is concerned , we have built a madhouse and continue to live according to the laws of a madhouse . " Conservative Deputies warned that society was " slipping into a swamp even more boggy than in the stagnation period . " At one point Deputy Teimuraz Avaliani , from a Siberian coal-mining region , even urged the parliamentarians " not to vote for Gorbachev under any circumstances . " <P> They did , but his victory was a far cry from the 99.9% landslides once manufactured for Soviet leaders . Now allowed to vote their own minds , 495 Deputies opposed Gorbachev , 54 abstained , another 122 walked off with their ballots to protest the undemocratic spectacle and as many as 245 failed to participate at all . Against no competition , he won with a victory majority of only 59%.
