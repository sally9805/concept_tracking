I could n't believe my luck when I opened the mail that spring day in 1992 . Not only had I received a Wyoming sheep tag , but the area I would be hunting was in the Absaroka mountain range , northwest of Cody . I live across the state in Sundance , Wyoming , but during my years with the Soil Conservation Service I had once been stationed in Cody and had heard stories of the Sunlight Basin in the Shoshone National Forest , which is the unit my permit entitled me to hunt . It is rich in big game  --  elk , deer and sheep  --  and has earned a reputation that has drawn thousands of out-of-state hunters over the years . I also knew from my time in Cody that this can be a dangerous region , with steep backcountry mountains exceeding 10,000 feet and few trails should you run into trouble . The area is also prime bear country ... and I had heard that it also was a spot where wildlife officers dumped " problem " grizzlies from nearby Yellowstone National Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that I had finally been lucky enough to draw a tag that would allow me to conduct my first-ever sheep hunt in this game-rich area about halfway between Cody and Yellowstone Lake . And as if in confirmation that I was on a roll , the mailman also had delivered me a bonus in the form of a moose tag . I would be hunting with two longtime friends , Don Viktorin from Worland , Wyoming , and Lonnie Schultz , from Laramie . Like me , Schultz is a former resident of Cody , but unlike me , he had been on a number of sheep hunts in the area . The plan was for Viktorin to arrange for horses to pack us into a main camp about five miles from the trailhead . We would base ourselves here for the nine-day hunt , and if we found distant sheep we 'd backpack into the higher elevations and hunt out of spike camps . The signs that my luck might change began right from the start of our hunt on September 1 . At a bad spot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and injured its hip . We were only halfway to the area we had planned for our base camp and had to quit for the day and set up in this spot . We decided that the best plan would be for Viktorin to stay in camp with the horses while Schultz and I hiked in deeper and made a small spike camp . That change was a bit disappointing , but I was still plenty excited . Schultz had already spotted a bunch of sheep as we were riding in and that only added to my hopes for success . I had a hard time getting to sleep that night . As Schultz and I hiked in the next morning , I spotted fresh bear scat and later we found a place where bears had been digging for squirrels . They were n't welcome sights , but Schultz was n't concerned . " I would n't worry about it , " he said . " I 've been hunting here for 15 years , and I 've never had any trouble with bears . " His words were reassuring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area where problem bears were released kept playing across my mind . We crawled into our sleeping bags early that night because the next morning was opening day , and we wanted to make the most of our time . I could n't shake the thought of bears even after I had turned in . We had followed all of the rules and cached our food up high and away from our sleeping area , and this was hardly the first time I had been on a wilderness hunt . Still , the feel of my .270 rifle lying next to me in the small tent was reassuring . Opening day began so full of promise that I had little time to think any more about bears . Early on , I saw a small ram but decided to pass him up . Later another ram appeared , and this one very definitely caught my interest . It had a very good full curl . Unfortunately , we spooked him out of the drainage he was in . We figured there was a chance to cut him off on a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . that would be the last legal ram we would see for the next three days . Three days of hard hunting . Schultz was disappointed and theorized that the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had caused the sheep to change their habits . This was the first time that he had been back in the area since the fires had burned almost half of Yellowstone and tens of thousands of acres of the Shoshone National Forest . Whether that was why we could n't find the sheep or not , we decided to pull our spike camp and head back to the base camp . From there maybe we could figure out a successful new strategy . On the way back down , near the area where I had spotted the bear scat four days earlier , we jumped a black bear across a deep gully . We had not gone but a couple of hundred yards farther down the trail when Schultz tugged at my backpack . I looked up to see a grizzly sow with two cubs only 80 feet away and running parallel to us . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seeing a grizzly up close , especially a sow with cubs , had me spooked . The grizzly stopped . She stood on her hind legs and stared directly at us . Schultz and I chambered live rounds with as little movement as possible . But then the sow just dropped down and ran into the timber with her cubs trailing . " That 's the closest I ever want to come to a grizzly , " I said to Schultz . In just hours I would come even closer . A lot closer . When we got into the base came we learned that Viktorin had experienced bad luck , too . He had suffered a kidney stone attack and had painfully ridden out to our truck and then driven to the hospital in Cody . He had been admitted , but the attack was not a serious one so he was released after an overnight stay . Viktorin was washed out , but he had come back into the base camp , figuring he would have time to rest up before we were scheduled to return . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so disappointed that he decided to go home early . Viktorin and I would stay on for a few days and look for sheep at lower elevations . Then I would help him get his lame horse out . After dinner , I spotted some sheep in the valley above camp . It was too far to tell if there were any rams with them , but I was excited all over again . I was out of camp before daybreak the next day , guiding myself in the dark with a small flashlight and lugging a backpack loaded with 20 pounds of gear . Viktorin was asleep when I left , still exhausted from his bout with the kidney stones . I worked my way uphill for a couple of hours with no sign of sheep . When I dropped off the ridge from where I had been scouting and walked into a finger of pine trees , I noted that the wind was at my back . It would carry my scent in front of me , and I figured I would n't see any game close up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the majestic view of Sunlight Basin and take a few pictures . Moving on , I saw a deep ravine that I would have to cross and thought I saw a place to do so about 150 yards below me . To reach it , I would have to go into the timber and work down in a switchback fashion . The ground was damp , making it easy to walk quietly . Suddenly I saw a movement . A brown-colored bear stood on its hind legs in a patch of downed timber just 40 feet downhill from me . I stood rooted to the spot . When my eyes locked on the bear 's , I knew I was in trouble . in one terrible moment that I 'll never be able to forget , the bear charged . It was only then that I realized that I had not chambered a round . I had carried my rifle that way for safety 's sake in this rugged country . The charge was so incredibly fast that I had no time to load my rifle . My brain told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , I dropped to the ground and braced for the worst . As I hit the ground , the bear struck my right side , growling and biting my head . Its weight and strength completely overpowered me . But even though I was helpless , I was keenly aware of my rifle that now lay on the ground next to me . I had to stay within reach of that gun . It was my only hope . I felt the grizzly 's big teeth ripping and grating across my skull as it tried to bite into my head . I struggled desperately to keep my arms clasped around my skull . Blood poured from my scalp and gushed down over my face . The bear seized my upper right arm and yanked on it . The grizzly was trying to drag me off . I fought to stay close to the gun . A couple of times I even dropped my right hand for an instant to feel for the rifle . It was still there . But each time I dropped my hand , the movement seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its attack . The grizzly bit my right hand hard , then suddenly jumped over me , biting into my left shoulder . The strength in its jaws convinced me that it would rip my arms off . Numbness overcame me . I knew I was going to die . I said a quick prayer . Suddenly something inside me snapped . No longer was I willing to be torn apart like a rag doll . " If I 'm going to die , you 're dying too , " I thought . Or maybe I shouted it aloud . I ca n't be sure . Was it Providence ? New resolve ? My shout ? Whatever it was , it made a difference . The grizzly stopped tearing at me . I grabbed the rifle with both hands , worked the bolt to chamber a cartridge and lifted the gun . The grizzly reacted to this movement by tearing into my left shoulder again . But now I was determined to fight . I managed to fire the rifle . The frenzied grizzly reacted immediately . It instantly stopped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was hit . Nor did I much care . All I knew was that I was free of the animal . the bear ran only about 25 feet when it stopped to look back at me . Again we locked eyes . Despite the horrible pain and fear , I was alert enough to see that the bear 's fur was splattered with blood and a dark streak ran down its left side . I chambered a new shell . " Come on , bear , this time I 'm ready . " Adrenaline had taken hold . Paralyzed fear had been overwhelmed by the will to live . The grizzly leaped over a downfall and vanished into the forest . It was over . I would not die . At least not yet . I could feel my skull  --  the bear had nearly scalped me . Blood ran down my face and neck , soaking my down jacket . I tried to stop the bleeding by applying pressure , but the head wounds were too extensive for me to do much . If I did n't get help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic started . Camp was a little more than a mile away , all downhill . I dropped the backpack and started running . My headlong rush off the mountain might not have been the wisest thing to do because I 'd lose blood even faster , but I did n't care . I knew the grizzly could still be around , stalking me in the timber . My only thoughts were to get out of the area , and forever away from that bear . About a third of the way to camp I stopped in a clearing and fired three quick shots . Viktorin heard them and started hiking in my direction . I had only one shell left . I resumed hiking toward camp , stumbling as I went . The bleeding seemed to be slowing down , and for the first time since the attack I thought that I might survive . I fired my last shot about a quarter-mile from camp and heard Viktorin 's wonderful voice not too far off . " Terry , are you all right ? " he shouted . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viktorin reached me , he tried to get me to lay down , but I would have none of it . I just wanted to get to camp . The realization of what had happened was starting to sink in . And with that recollection had come excruciating pain . Viktorin carried my rifle and helped me back to camp . As I hobbled along , we counted our options . Should he leave me at camp and go for help ? Should we ride out together ? I chose to ride out . Viktorin quickly saddled up Rusty and Sugar , the two fastest horses . He pushed me up onto one of them and I held on as best I could . It took a little more than an hour for us to reach the trailhead , where Viktorin helped me get into the back of my pickup truck . Fifteen minutes later we were at the Sunlight Basin Ranger Station , where a call was put in for an ambulance . Viktorin kept driving me on toward Cody so that we could meet the ambulance en route . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been nearly four hours since the attack . West Park County Hospital in Cody is where many victims of bear attacks and buffalo gorings from Yellowstone are admitted . During three hours of surgery , it took Dr. Jeffrey Balison more than 250 stitches and staples to repair nearly three feet of lacerations and close several puncture wounds , the majority of them to my head . I 'd lost four units of blood . But there were no broken bones and I would have no facial disfigurement . Viktorin returned to camp the following day with Wyoming Game and Fish Department and U.S. Forest Service personnel . They found grizzly tracks in the snow and confirmed that they had come from a sow with two cubs . They also concluded that the sow had not been hit with my bullet . Somewhere , she was still feeding in the area . The blood that I 'd seen on the bear was mine . I was dismissed from the hospital after 48 hours . Two weeks later I returned to the attack site and retrieved my backpack , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I figured that the bear had returned and rolled it down the hill in its fury . Amazingly , the pack was virtually undamaged , with only bent frame . I credit it for saving my life by protecting my neck during the attack . it was not even a month later when I took a moose with a respectable 37-inch-wide rack . Then , with just four days remaining in the season , I killed my first sheep , a nice three-quarters-curl ram . The area I hunted had only a 33 percent success rate that season . I remembered how lucky I felt the day that my sheep tag arrived . Even after what happened , I still consider myself lucky . Very lucky indeed . NEW DEFENSE Firearms have always been controversial means of defense against grizzly bears . The justification question aside , a charging bear must be hit perfectly to be stopped . If wounded by a gunshot , a bear can become even more dangerous . Pepper sprays such as counter Assault may provide the ultimate solution to stopping a charging bear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their tracks by Counter Assault . Yellowstone Park rangers routinely carry it as do wildlife officers who patrol in bear country . Counter Assault is made of capsicum derived from African chili peppers . The heat rating or pungency factor of this pepper is 1 million compared with about 50,000 for most common peppers . Peppers sprays are now legal in all states except New York . Suggested retail for counter Assault is $39.95 and $12.95 for the holster. for information , contact Counter Assault , box 4721 , Missoula , MT 59806 ( 800-695-3394 ) . LIVING WITH BEARS Wildlife officials claim that there are a least 236 grizzlies in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , which includes Yellowstone Park and six adjacent national forests . Because grizzlies are secretive and hard to count , some population estimates run higher . Bears appear to be increasing at a rate of about 4 percent annually . As bears increase , so do bear observations and encounters . Cody-based outfitter Gary Fales has hunted in prime grizzly country all his life . Although he believes that bear numbers in his hunting are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower elevations and becoming bolder . " A grizzly was seen in my front yard last year , " he explained . " I 'm concerned for my kids . They are n't allowed to walk to the school bus stop anymore . We drive them . " Fales believes that the range expansion could prove tragic . " I would n't be surprised if a grizzly got into a schoolyard or campground and killed people , " he said . " It may be only a matter of time . " although more bears are being spotted each year , Cody outfitter Duane Wiltse disagrees . In my opinion , bears are less troublesome because they have more food available to them due to the Yellowstone fires of 1988 . The fires cleared the way for lush new vegetation on which the grizzlies can feed . Many residents of grizzly country insist that the bears have become bolder since grizzly hunting ended . Montana lost its grizzly season two years ago as a result of a court case brought by anti-hunting groups as well as a change in ruling by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a grizzly season since 1974 . Both states contain the majority of grizzlies in the Lower 48 ( a small number inhabit Idaho and Washington ) . Biologists in Wyoming and Montana say the grizzlies must first be delisted from their current status as " threatened " before initiating any procedure that could allow grizzly hunting once again . With the Endangered Species Act up for renewal ( see " Perilous Times for The Endangered Species Act , " May 1994 ) , agencies are waiting to see how the new act is worded before moving forward . Currently , a grizzly can only be killed in self-defense . BEAR SAFETY * Always keep a clean camp * Place cooking gear and food in stuff sacks and hang at least 10 feet off the ground and four feet out from tree trunks * Refuse should either be burned or hung in plastic bags to be carried out when leaving * Avoid hiking at night in bear country * Always avoid suprising a bear * Never get between a sow and her cubs * Never cause a bear to feel cornered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout or scream at a bear but rather talk in a clear , soft voice * If a bear stands its ground and makes a series of " whoof ' sounds and/or pops its teeth , the bear has determined that you are a threat . Try backing away slowly in a diagonal motion , but if the bear follows , stop where you are . Never run away . Bears will chase fleeing animals and can reach speeds of 35 mph . They will also often bluff charges to within 10 feet of adversaries . * If you are charged , it is best to play dead . Drop to the ground , pull your knees to your chest and clasp your hands behind your neck <p>
