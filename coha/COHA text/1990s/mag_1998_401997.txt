BY MARTHA FRANKEL PHOTOGRAPHS BY WAYNE MASER // * Dressed in tight capri pants and a tiny tee , Pamela Anderson lee strolls through the soundstage where her new action-comedy series , VIP , is being filmed . Stopping to chat with everyone from the producers to the grips , Lee , 31 , appears to be the den mother of the set . " How 's your mom ? " she asks a crew member , offering to hook him tip with a new doctor to help the situation . " Let me know what I cem do , " she says , tenderly squeezing his arm . On the syndicated VIP , Lee plays Vallery Irons , a hotdog-stand worker who , through a zany series of events , becomes a bodyguard .

" This show is perfect For me . I 'm producing it , so I get to decide just how ditzy Vai ller acts , " says the ex-Baywatch beauty as she , walks hy the pool at Vallery Irons 's apartment . " I get to decide when to put on a bathing suit . And I get to decide if I save everyone  --  Or let a few of them die ! " Glamour , action , comedy-the show has it all , " she adds . " For story lines , I just have to steal from my own life ! " Lee cracks up at this , but when she see a crew member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to him . He had hit a rough patch With his girlfriend and Lee wants to know how things arc going now . " Did she like the flowers ? " she asks . He nods , and her face lights up-she 's thrilled that her idea helped smooth things over . " Now just he nice to her and everything should he okey  --  dokey . " Tommy Trauma It would take a lot more than flowers to rescue Lee 's own relationship . Just hvo days before this scene unfolded , Lee 's husband-Motley Cre drummer and notorious bad boy Tommy Lee-began serving a six-month selltenee in the Los Angeles County Jail for Spousal abuse , and the couple 's divorce is pending . " I 'm not gon na cry because I have to do a scene in five minutes , " Lee says , fighting back tears . " It 's been the hardest thing . It 's very ; very sad . It just seems so unfinished , so unresolved or whatever , and I know lie really loves me , and I love him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , we 're definitely **31;448;TOOLONG this is really paintill . " Lee swallows hard and forces a smile . " What a year , " she sayS , shaking her head slowly . What a year , indeed . The Year of Living Dangerously In May of 1997 , Lee was sued for allegedly backing out of the cable-TV movie Hello , She Lied . When the lawsuit hit the news , it was reported that she had quit the project because she did n't want to appear nude on-screen , which the script called for . The real issue , however , was money . The movie 's producers claimed Lee had reneged on a verbal agreement to do the movie ; they went ahead and made it anyway , changing the name to Miami Hustle and hiring Kathy Ireland to replace Lee . When the film tanked , the producers sued . " They tried to prove how much they lost by not using me-is n't that ridiculous ? " Lee says . " They sued me for $5 million and lost on every count . " Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never agreed to do the movie  --  ) it the publicity ( the trial was broadcast on Court TV ) was stressful . Lee says she paid a quarter of a million dollars " defending myself on something that was totally , bogus . " And to some , she came off as hypocritical for supposedly protesting about appearing nude . After all , she 'd made millions as a sex symbol , and the now-infamous video of her and Tommy honeymooning in Cancun , Mexico , had been in circulation for months before the televised trial . Stolen from the Lees ' Malibu home and marketed over the Internet and via an 800 numbers the video shows Pamela and Tommy making love . Lee says she 's loath to be quoted about the video : " Any attention I draw to it gives another person a reason to buy it , " she says . But she does have a few choice ( unprintable ) words for Internet Entertainment Group ( IEG ) , the company that has made an estimated $oO million from sales of the video . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suing them full-force , " she says of her suit against IEG , which is pending in Federal court . // Things went from bad to worse for Pamela this past February , when she and Tommy had a violent argument at their home . He assaulted her in front of their boys , Dylan and Brandon , then just seven weeks and 18 months old , respectively . Pamela called 911 , and Tommy was arrested . " Picking up that phone was the hardest thing I ever did in my life , " she says . " But I had to protect the kids . I 've never been so afraid . " I catch myself some days , you know , really missing Tommy , " she continues , " and wanting to go to his rescue like I always have . But then I tell myself , That obviously does n't work-it 's his trip and there 's nothing era can do . " As traumatic as it was , Pamela ; s split from Tommy has been a sort of godsend for her , the catalyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new house , one that 's " bright and full of flowers , not dark and gothic like our old house . " Gone is the old Pamela Lee , the one who , during a trup to Tahiti , got a primitive tattoo in a hammer-and-bamboo procedure that was so painful it made her pass out . " I woke up , threw up violently , then went back at two in the morning to have it finished , " she says . " I used to say , If you 're gon na do it , overdo it . ' But I 'm changing my theory on life . Things need to be done , not overdone . " Meet the New Pamela Now , Pamela Lee is softer , less extreme . Instead of the wild I just-got-out-of-bed hair , she has a sleek , understated do , pulled back with a little clip . Her new look is a far cry from that of the canyon-cleavaged character she played on Baywatch from 1992 to 1996 and the leather-clad biker chick she portrayed in the action flick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was interviewed for this story , she wore just a hint of mascara and a tiny bit of lip gloss ; her freckles stood out more than her breasts . Lee tries to downplay the apparent changes , saying she 's still the same old Pamela . " I 've obviously evolved , but you know what ? I like being a Barbie . Half of my closet has the Barbie clothes and the other half has Armani , Dolce &; Gabbana , and Versace . I 'm not trying to change my image . I 'm just growing . " It 's funny , when I do photo shoots lately , " she continues , " photographers are like , We want to shoot you like you 've never been shot before . ' And I 'm like , Oh , God , please . Just go shoot Kate Moss if you want that natural look . " ' Drama Mama Lc 's life now centers around her sons , Brandon , who will be 2 when this story comes out , and Dylan , who will be eS months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cute , " she says . Lee 's VIP dressing room has turned into a playpen . Stuffed animals and toy trucks are strewn about , and the baby 's crib has leopard-print sheets . " I 've been a full-blown mother since I was a little girl , " she says . " My brother , Gerry , is four years younger than mc , and I thought he was born for me . I looked after him like he was my own . I thought I 'd have children before I was 20 . My cousins had kids when they were 16 , 17 , 18 . That 's what I come from . " Photograph // Sitting amid the baby clutter in her dressing room , Lee kicks off her shoes and sticks her feet into my lap , giggling . She does things like this now and then , playful , girlish things that belie her image as a vixen and convince you that her transformation from wild child to mellow mama might just be for real . But I have my doubts when she blurts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm more satisfied than ever ! Wan na see their pictures ? " She reads the shock in my face and smiles wickedly . Then , she pulls out a photo album and opens it . " Are n't they gorgeous ? " she asks , staring adoringly at snapshots of her sons . Small-Town Girl Makes It Big Pamela Anderson has lived on the edge all her life . Born in ladysmith , on Canada 's Vancouver Island , Lee is the daughter of teenage parents , Carol and Barry Anderson , a waitress and a furnace repairman . The first place Pamela can remember living was a tiny house perched on a bluff , 80 feet above the Pacific Ocean . The family moved around a lot , and although Pamela was a good student , she cared more about her social life . As brother Gcrry writes in her biography on her official Web site ( **25;481;TOOLONG ) , she was nicknamed Popcorn because " she would kind of hop when she was running from the boys . " The online biography describes Pamela 's childhood largely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular and active in sports ( especially volleyball ) and music ( she played saxophone and sang in a jazz choir ) , and she shared a close relationship with her brother . As Gerry writes , however , " Things were tense at home . As far as I remember , Pam and our father were at odds a lot .... Looking back , it seemed like there was a lot of yelling going on and the only voice being heard was the old man 's . " Lee is quick to come to her father 's defense . " My dad has really mellowed out , " she says . " He 's a different man now than he was when I was young . " he and her mother moved to Los Angeles two years ago to be with Lee and her brother , and to help raise Brandon and Dylan . " Dad 's very close to the boys , " she says . " He takes them out every day to play . " " But my mom has grown up with this bitterness-she has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's part of the reason I 've been strong about Tommy , because she always told me , ' I do n't want you to stay in an abusive marriage . " ' Moving Out , Moving On As she grew older , Pamela yearned to leave behind her smalltown life in Canada ; she got her chance at age 22 . A fitness instructor at the time , she was " going nowhere-and had a bad boyfriend , to boot . " Lee says . One afternoon in 1989 , she attended a Bristish Columbia Lions football game , wearing a Labatt 's beer T-shirt . When a camera scanning the crowd projected her image onto the stadium 's wide screen , the fans cheered wildly . Pamela 's obvious sex appeal and instant popularity impressed Labatt 's executives , who tracked her down and offered her a contract as their Blue Zone Girl . Needless to say , she accepted . Having achieved minor celebrity with the ad , Lee attended a fashion show in wllich a girlfriend of hers was modeling , and a Playboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a pictorial and possibly even a cover . " I asked my mother what she thought about my posing nude , and she said she would do it if they asked her , so I did it . " Later that year , Lee went to Los Angeles to do the Playboy shoot-and never returned home . Her exposure in the magazine ( she appered on the cover of the October 1989 issue ) quickly led to other work . She landed the of Lisa , The Tool Time Girl on Home Improvement , and spent two years wearing overalls and delivering wrenches and screwdrivers to Tin Allen 's TVshow character . Then , after a single audition for Baywatch in 1992 , she signed on to play crystal-gazing C.J. Parker , the role that brought her to the attention of more than a billion people . During Lee 's four years on the syndicated program , Bac ) watch was the most-watched television show in the world , and it became the first American show to be broadcast in China . In 1996 , when she was pregnant with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I felt like it was a great opportunity , " she says of VIP , whose producer is J.F. Lawton , the writer of Pretty Woman . During her transition form Baywatch Wire , playing a futuristic bounty hunter in S &M; garb . Although critics panned the movie , Lee counts it as a personal success . " I had starred in just one television show , " Lee says . " The fact that I was offered a starring role in a film that was gon na be a theatrical release was huge for me . I was really proud . " In 1993 , Pamela was engaged for a short time to actor Scott Baio , and after that union fell apart , she dated producer Jon Peters , Poison lead singer Bret Michaels , TV Superman Dean Cain , former MTV host Eric Nies , and surfer Kelly Slater . Then , on February 19 , 1995 , she married Tommy Lee on the beach in Cancun . The couple had met four short days earlier . " It was a love-at-first-sight kind of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong attraction . " The bride wore a teeny white bikini and sunglasses ; the groom was in nothing but cut-offs , proudly displaying the tattoos that cover his body ( MAYHEM is written in huge letters across his stomach ) . The Lees certainly wasted no time starting a family ( Brandon was born June 5,1996 ) . " He has a lot of good qualities , " Pamela says of Tommy . " I know hc always wanted to be a father , and I thought he 'd be a terrific dad . " 344 Concentrating on her work has helped Lee rebound from the emotional trauma of her split from Tommy It has brought a routine to her life , which is exactly what she needs now . " I want things to be normal for a while , whatever the hell that means , " she says . Really , she knows exactly what it means : concentrating on her work , raising her boys , spending time with her family . " Pamela 's a lot smarter than she lets on , " says J.F. Lawton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she 's smart and shrewd and knows exactly what she wants . " What she says she does n't want is to follow her usual romantic pattern and dive right in with another man ( even if the tabloids hinted in August that she was seeing former boyfriend Kelly Slater ) . " People talk to me about men these days and I just cringe , " she says . " First of all , I 'm still married to Tommy . Plus , I am so not interested in men now . I 've never really been alone . I 've always been , well , an overlapper in the boyfriend department . But I have two beautiful children , so I am very fulfilled . " And I 'm working really hard , so I ca n't imagine even having time right now for men , or even for Tommy . If I ever meet another guy , he 's going to have to be really great for me to allow him in my life with my children , and he 's going to have to realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tommy 's like another child , and he 's always going to be in my life . " Lee holds out her left hand , displaying the tattoo on her ring finger . It reads TOMMY . " I 'm thinking of changing it to MOMMY , " she says . Lee says she now talks to Tommy occasionally in monitored telephone calls that he places from jail . " You know , he has to change . He 's in there , he 's doing therapy , and when he gets out , we 'll see what happens . I really do n't believe that we 'll ever be together again , but he 's always going to be the father of my children . So , I support his growth as a human being-I want him to be a good dad . " Last Mother 's Day , " she continues , " he sent me a card . Inside , he wrote , It must 've been really hard being a mother to all three of us , looking after us . ' He knows what 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get better . " <p>
