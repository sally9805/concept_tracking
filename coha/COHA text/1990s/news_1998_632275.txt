<p> It was a valued and sometimes even , sacred commodity in ancient Greece , where citizens used it as a body rub and as an aromatic symbol to anoint honored guests . <p> Nowadays , you can probably think of a few other ways to use olive oil . Try it , for instance , as a base ingredient for papriche stufate , a sweet and comforting stew of yellow peppers and tomatoes that is unspeakably easy to make and unspeakably delicious to eat . <p> Or use it as an essential element in a tangy vinaigrette . Or , at its most basic , drizzle it lightly across a piece of grilled fish and sprinkle with a few fresh herbs . <p> While its uses have changed considerably , the value of olive oil is still riding high . Its cardiovascular health benefits are often touted . It 's a versatile cooking oil that performs equally well at flavoring sauces for simple pasta dishes and turning out beautifully fried foods . <p> And it comes in a wide range of flavors and textures . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand for various dishes and uses . <p> Albert Cirillo is one such devotee . Cirillo , a professor of Renaissance literature at Northwestern University , is also the wine director at Convito Italiano in Wilmette . When the Italian restaurant and grocery store hosted a tasting of nine different olive oils from various regions in Italy , Cirillo provided the commentary . <p> The oils ' flavors ranged from smooth and rich to nutty to almost peppery . But , Cirillo cautioned , do n't let subtle nuances  --  or culinary know-it-alls  --  sway your preferences . <p> " There 's no such thing as the ' best ' olive oil , " Cirillo said . " The best one for you is the one you like best  --  the one that suits your palate or the dish you 're cooking . " <p> Delicate dishes call for delicate oils , such as those from the Liguria region in northwestern Italy . But more robust dishes can stand up to something with a little more bite  --  L'abbatte brand , for instance , from Puglia , near the heel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no one " best " olive oil , Cirillo said , there are plenty of excellent ones  --  their quality determined by a number of factors . <p> Like the taste of fine wine , the flavor of fine olive oil depends on its chief raw ingredient  --  the olives used . Factors include the quality of the olives themselves , the soil in which they 're grown , the degree of ripeness when they 're picked , and even how they 're picked . ( If gathered from the ground after they fall , they 're likely to be overripe or damaged ; finer oils are made from olives that fall into nets suspended in the trees . The finest  --  and , obviously , the most expensive  --  are made from olives picked by hand . ) <p> The olives must be pressed as soon as possible after harvest , or they 'll oxidize ( their flavor will be damaged by exposure to air ) . <p> Traditionally , olives are first crushed by giant granite stones ; the resulting pulp is then spread on hemp mats stacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hydraulic press , which extracts the oil and filters out the solids in the pulp . The oil is then whirled in a centrifuge to separate out any water . <p> The oil  --  like wine  --  can be blended after it 's pressed . Blending need n't produce an inferior oil , Cirillo said . <p> But if you 're after pure Italian oil , it 's not a bad idea to be wary of labels that say " packed " in Italy or " produced " in Italy . What 's inside may not be Italian oil ; it could well be a blend that is simply bottled in Italy , with Spanish and Greek oils added ( Spain is the world 's top producer of olive oil ) . <p> Instead , Cirillo suggested , look for the words prodotto ed imbottigliato ( produced and bottled ) on the label . <p> Cirillo addressed other misconceptions about olive oil as well . Color , for example : According to popular opinion , the oil should be deep green . But " color is n't an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It all depends on what type of olive is used ( and ) its ripeness when picked . " Some fine oils are golden ; others are deep green because olive leaves have been crushed along with the oil . <p> Cirillo also clarified the phrase " extra virgin . " Extra virgin simply is a legal classification meaning that the oil is less than 1 percent oleic acid . While most high-quality oils are indeed extra virgin , just having the moniker is no guarantee of quality . <p> Cirillo looks askance at oils marketed as " light " or " extra light . " These are often hyper-refined oils , he said , " with no flavor , no aroma . They 're for people who do n't like olive oil . " And , he added , they 're not especially lighter in calories . <p> One particularly persistent myth is that serious cooks do n't use olive oil for deep frying . But it actually performs quite well in the deep fryer ; its smoking point is the same as that of corn oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fry in ; deep frying requires sizable amounts of what can be a pricy oil  --  and unlike other oils , it should n't be used for frying more than two or three times . <p> But , says Peggy Knickerbocker , frying in olive oil can be worth the effort . In her book Olive Oil : From Tree to Table ( Chronicle Books , $ 19.95 ) , the San Francisco food writer includes recipes using olive oil in imaginative and often simple ways  --  and she describes the variety of foods deep-fried in olive oil , including rice croquettes , fish and fritters in Italy ; cheese , seafood and bread in Greece ; thinly sliced vegetables in the south of France . <p> She recommends the same common-sense tips used for any deep-frying oil : Make sure the oil is hot enough ( 350 to 365 degrees ) ; heat the oil slowly ; do n't add too much food at once ; lift food with tongs and drain on a wire rack placed over paper towels . ( Foods put directly on paper , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book waxes eloquent on oil from all over , including Spain , Greece , Israel and even California . She includes recipes that pair the oils from each area with regional dishes . But , like Cirillo , she encourages experimentation and flexibility . <p> At Convito 's tasting , Andrea Bailey , the restaurant 's chef , served nine different dishes she 'd created with the oils being tasted . The foods ranged from a hearty white bean and duck salad made with the robust Tuscan Capezzana to a seafood pesto salad made with delicate Calvi oil from Liguria  --  to extremely satisfying stewed peppers and tomatoes flavored with Santi Garda from Veneto . <p> Bailey says some of the best dishes made with olive oil are also the simplest . She recommends lightly brushing grilled meat with a good oil , then sprinkling on a little sea salt . " It 's also great in mashed potatoes , with garlic , " she said . <p> For home cooks curious about experimenting with olive oil , Bailey recommends starting slowly , with simpler preparations . <p> " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " and if it starts smoking , you 've lost the flavor . " <p> Shop where you can taste oils before buying them , she advises , and do n't be afraid to ask questions about what you 're buying . <p> Convito stocks roughly 24 different kinds of oils at any one time , said owner Nancy Barocci . Most are Italian , but the store carries a few labels from Spain , California and Israel as well . Prices range from $ 9 for a 500 ml. bottle of Spanish oil to about $ 40 for a 750 ml. bottle of Italy 's Castello di Ama . <p> The oil should be stored in a cool , dark place  --  not near the stove  --  and should be used within a year or two of the olives ' harvest . <p> And , said Barocci , you may simply want to use your best oils as she does  --  as a condiment for breads , vegetables and soups . <p> " Buy one or two , just use them and see what you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to experiment  --  that 's part of the fun of it .
