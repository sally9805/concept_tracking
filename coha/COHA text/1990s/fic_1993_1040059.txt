 | treated myself to the afternoon , catching a movie on Twentythird Street , then walking downtown to the Village . I passed the apartment building that had risen where Cunningham 's had once stood , and the brownstone a block away where Carl Uhl had been murdered .

" I said it sounded fine .  | After dinner I opened the envelope I 'd been carrying around all day and got out the printouts of the TRW reports , along with the letter of commendation Wally had dictated to the client . Elaine went into the other room to watch Jeopardy and I had a look at what just about anybody with a couple of bucks to spend could find out about the financial standing and billpaying habits of the fourteen living members of the club of thirty-one . I had gone through most of the stack when Elaine brought me a cup of coffee and the news that none of the three contestants had known that Benjamin Harrison was the grandson of William Henry Harrison .

" This is great , " she said . " Wally dictated it ? " " So he says . " " It 's perfect , do n't you think ? You should make it a point to get one of these whenever you 've got a client who tells you what a great job you did for him . " " I suppose . " " Your enthusiasm is contagious .

" I think you feel you ought to want it , but you do n't , and that 's what upsets you . But it 's your call . " I went back to the stack of credit reports . It was slow going , because I did n't know what I was looking for . My hope was that I would recognize it when I saw it . Douglas Pomeroy . Robert Ripley . William Ludgate . Lowell Hunter . Avery Davis . Brian O'Hara . John Gerard Billings . Robert Berk . Kendall McGarry . John Youngdahl . Richard Bazerian . Gordon Walser . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of them looked like . I 'd seen Gerry Billings on television , talking about cold fronts and the threat of rain . In my library research I 'd come upon news photos of Gordon Walser ( with two partners , celebrating the opening of their own ad agency ) and Rick Bazerian ( with two punked-out rock stars who 'd just signed with his record label ) . And of course I 'd been seeing Avery Davis 's picture in the paper for years . I 'd been in the same room with Ray Gruliow a couple of times over the years , although we 'd never been introduced . And I knew Lewis Hildebrand , my client . But it seemed to me as though I could picture all of them readily enough , including the ones whose faces were wholly unfamiliar to me . As I read their names and reviewed their credit histories , images kept popping into my mind . I saw them walking behind power mowers over suburban lawns , I saw them dressed in suits , I watched them bend over to scoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the golf course . then saw them  | having a drink in the clubhouse after they 'd showered and changed , drinking whiskey and soda , say , in a tall frosted glass . I could see them , in their well-tailored suits , leaving their houses at dawn , coming home at dusk . I could see them standing on platforms with their newspapers , waiting for the Long Island Rail Road or Metro North . I could see them striding purposefully along a midtown sidewalk , carrying brassbound attache cases , on their way to meetings . I could picture them at the opera or the ballet , their wives finely dressed and bejeweled , themselves at once resplendent and slightly self-conscious in evening clothes . I could imagine them on cruise ships , in national parks , at backyard barbecues . It was silly , because I did n't even know what they looked like . But I could see them . " I 'll give it another day or two , " I told Elaine , " and then I 'm going to call Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His group 's running a high death rate and an unusual number of homicides , but that does n't mean somebody 's knocking them off one by one . " " You got all that from a batch of credit reports ? " " What I got , " I said , " is a picture of fourteen very orderly lives . I 'm not saying these men do n't have a dark side . The odds are a couple of them drink too much , or gamble for high stakes , or do something they would n't want their neighbors to know about . Maybe this one slaps his wife around , maybe that one ca n't keep it in his pants . But there 's a degree of stability in every one of their lives that just does n't fit a serial murderer . " " If he 's been doing it for this long , " she said , " he 's unusually disciplined . " " And patient , and well organized . No question about it . But there 'd be chaos in his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a lot of backing and filling , a lot of fresh starts and makeovers . I 'd expect to see a lot of job changes , a lot of geographics . It 's almost inconceivable that he 'd have stayed married to the same person for a substantial period of time , for example . " " And have they all managed that ? " " No , there have been quite a few divorces . But the ones who 've divorced show a consistent pattern of career stability . There 's no-L L ti .. 1 , . ur. - un who looks at all like the kind of loose A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 107  | cannon he 'd almost have to be , in order to do the damage he 's done . " " So it 's not somebody in the group . " " And who could it be outside the group ? Nobody else knows these people exist . I told you I went out and saw Fred Karp 's widow . She was married to him for something like twenty-five years . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , but she thought they were fraternity brothers of his from Brooklyn College . And she did n't know the names of any of them . " " She also told you she did n't think he could have killed him-self . " " Well , the survivors always tell you that about suicides . If you go up in a tower and shoot twenty people , the neighbors tell the press you were a nice quiet boy . If you kill yourself , they say you had everything to live for . " " Then you think he did kill himself ? " " I think it 's beginning to look that way . " " I thought you said the suicides could have been faked . " " Most suicides could have been faked , " I said . " There are exceptions , like the poor son of a bitch who shot himself on live TV with the camera rolling . " " I 'm glad I missed that one . " " But even if most suicides could have been faked , " I went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are just what they look like . So are most accidents . " " You think the Warren Commission got it right ?

You think I 'm too quick to believe what I want to believe ? " " I did n't say that . " " Well , it 's a possibility , whether you said it or not . It seems to me I 've been working hard to prove that somebody really is knocking them off , and that I 'm coming reluctantly to the conclusion that the true villain of the piece is our old friend Coincidence . But maybe that 's what I wanted to conclude all along . I do n't know . " " It just seems to me , " she said , " that you 're attaching an awful lot of significance to a good credit rating .

You look at the TRW reports and all you see is one big Norman Rockwell painting . They 're the American Dream , are n't they ? " " I suppose so . " " And you feel excluded because you ca n't have that life , and even more excluded because you do n't even want it . That 's a big part of it , Matt , is n't it ? " The telephone rang . " Saved by the bell , " she said , grinning , and reached to answer it . " Hello ? May I ask who 's calling ? Just a moment , I 'll see if he can come to the phone . " She covered the mouthpiece with her hand . " Raymond Gruliow , " she said . " Oh ? " I took the phone from her and said hello . He said , " Mr. Scudder , this is Ray Gruliow . I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The voice was his , all right , rich and rasping , an instrument that he wielded like a rapier .

Madison , as I recalled , had been so victimized by racism that he dealt dope , robbed and murdered other dope dealers , and shot six of the cops who showed up at his mother 's house to arrest him . " Maybe we should , " I said . " I 've got a court appearance scheduled in the morning . How 's the later part of the afternoon ? Say , four o'clock ? " " Four is fine . " " Do you want to come over to my house ? I 'm on Commerce Street , if you know where that is . " " I know Commerce Street . " " Oh , of course you would .

He 's been killing his old friends for the past twenty years , and he wants my help in turning himself in. "  | Commerce Street is only two blocks long . It angles southwest from Seventh Avenue a block below Bleecker , and runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of a piece , with both sides lined with brick three-story Federal townhouses . Most are residential , but a few have commercial tenants on the first floor . One window shows a lawyer 's shingle , with a second matching shingle hanging just below the first . I ALSO DABBLE IN ANTIQUES , it announces , and there are antiques and collectibles in the window . The building two doors down houses a macrobiotic restaurant , its menu listing dishes of tofu and seitan and seaweed . Whatever else they dabble in remains unstated . The second block of Commerce Street , on the other side of Bedford , is more of a jumble architecturally . Buildings of different heights and shapes and styles are jammed together like straphangers in a rush-hour subway car . The street , as if confused by this sudden change of character , veers abruptly to the right and runs into Barrow Street , where it calls it quits . The Cherry Lane Theater is in the middle of the block , just before the street 's sudden change of direction . Raymond Gruliow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stood on the other side of the street , buttressed by a shorter and wider building building either side I climbed a half-flight of steps . There was a heavy A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 111  | brass door knocker in the shape of a lion 's head , and I had my hand on it when I saw the recessed button for the doorbell . I pushed that instead , and if a bell or buzzer rang within , no sound came through the heavy wooden door . I was ready to try the knocker when the door opened inward . Gruliow had answered it himself . He was a tall man , around six-three , and rail thin . His hair , once black , was an iron gray now , and he 'd let it grow ; it cascaded over his collar and lay in ringlets on his shoulders . The years had worked on his features like a caricaturist 's pen , lengthening the nose , accenting the bony ridge of brow , hollowing the cheeks , giving a forward thrust to the jaw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit up with a smile , as if he were genuinely glad to see me , as if someone had played a cosmic joke on the world and the two of us were in on it . " Matthew Scudder , " he said . " Welcome , welcome . I 'm Ray Gruliow . " He led me inside , apologizing for the condition of the house . It looked all right to me , if marked by a comfortable level of disor-der  --  books overflowing the built-in cabinets and piled on the floor , a stack of magazines alongside a club chair , a suit jacket folded over the back of a Victorian sofa . He was wearing the pants to the suit , and a white shirt with the collar open and the sleeves rolled up . He had sandals on his feet , Birkenstocks , and they looked odd over the thin black socks that went with the dark pinstriped suit . " My wife 's in Sag Harbor , " he explained . " I 'm going to join her out there tomorrow afternoon , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call her and tell her I 've got too much work . And I might just do that . What the hell 's the point of running out of town for a weekend , then running right back in again ? Is that supposed to be relaxing ? " " Some people do it all the time . " " Some people go to truck-pulling contests , " he said . " Some people sell Amway dealerships to their friends . Some people believe the earth is a hollow sphere , with another whole civilization living on the inside edge . " He shrugged eloquently . " Some people keep getting married . Are you married , Matt ? " " Virtually . " " ' Virtually . ' I like that . All right to call you Matt ? " I said it was .  | " And I 'm Ray . Virtually . ' I suppose that means living together ?

I 'm sixty-four years old and I have a daughter who was two in March , and she 's got a brother who 'll turn forty next month . He 's damn near old enough to be her grandfather . For Christ 's sake , I 've got three generations of families . " He shook his head at the wonder of it all . " I 'll be eighty years old , " he said , " and still paying to put a kid through college . " " They say it keeps you young . " " In self-defense , " he said . " I think it 's late enough for a drink . What can I get you ? " " Plain club soda , thanks . " " Perrier all right ? " I said it was . He fixed the drinks from a sideboard in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish whiskey to his . I recognized the shape of the bottle ; it was JJ &S,; Jameson 's premium label . The only other person I know who drinks it is a career criminal who owns a Hell 's Kitchen saloon , and he 'd have blanched at the thought of diluting it with soda . In the front room Gruliow gave me my drink , cleared off a chair for me , and sat on the sofa with his long legs out in front of him . " Matthew Scudder , " he said . " When I heard your name the other day , it was n't entirely unfamiliar to me . Actually , I 'm surprised our paths have n't crossed over the years .

I gave them an acceptable alternative . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He gave me a look , eyebrows raised , mouth on the verge of a smile . I 'd seen it before ; it was his patented expression of disappointed skepticism , flashed in court at a difficult witness , in the hallways at an uncooperative reporter . " In the first place , " he said , " do you seriously think the quality of life in this city is going to be measurably different for the rest of us if Warren Madison or anybody else is on or off its streets ? " " Yes , " I said , " but a cop has to believe that or it 's hard to get to work in the morning . " " You 're not a cop anymore . " " It 's like being raised Catholic , " I said . " You never get over it . And I do think it makes a difference , not so much in terms of the people Madison 's likely to kill but in the message people get when they see him walking around . " " But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They do n't see him walking around , not unless they 're in maximum security at Green Haven . That 's where Warren is , and where he 's likely to be until you and I are both long past caring . Remember what Torres said when he sentenced the kid for stabbing that Mormon boy in the subway ? Your parole officer has n't been born yet . ' You could say that about Warren . He killed those drug dealers , and he was convicted , and he 'll be behind bars as long as he lives . " " You could n't get him out from under those charges ? " " I never even tried . He had other counsel . And I would n't have wanted the case . Killing a drug dealer is murder for profit , and there arc plenty of other lawyers who can represent you . Shoot a cop and you 're making a political statement . That 's when a guy named Gruliow can do you some good . " " Somehow no one remembers that Madison 's serving time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course not . All they remember is Hard-Way Ray got him off . And the cops do n't care whether he 's locked up in Green Haven or out in Hollywood fucking Madonna . Their take on it is the same as yours , that I put the department on trial . I did n't , I put the system on trial , which is what I always do , in one sense or another . Whether it 's civil-rights workers or draft resisters or Palestinians or , yes , Warren Madison , I put the system on trial . But not everybody sees it that way . " He pointed at his plastic window . " Some of them take it personally . " I said , " I keep seeing that picture of you and Madison after the trial . " " Embracing . " " That 's the one . " " You figured what ? Bad taste ? Theatrical gesture ? " " Just a memorable image , " I said . " Ever hear of a criminal lawyer named Earl Rogers ? Very flamboyant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought up on charges of jury tampering . In another case his client was charged with some particularly odious murder . I forget the details , but Rogers won an acquittal . " " And ?

Get away from me , ' he cried out right there in the courtroom . ' You son of a bitch , you 're as guilty as sin ! ' " " Jesus . " " Now that 's theatrical , " he said with relish . " And bad taste , and ethically questionable at the very least . ' You 're guilty as sin ! ' They 're almost all of them guilty , for God 's sake . If you do n't want to defend the guilty , find another line of work . But if you do defend them , and if you 're lucky enough to win , you can damn well shake their hands . " He grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more my style than a handshake . And I felt like hugging Warren , I did n't have to fake it . It 's goddam exhilarating when they say ' Not guilty .

"  | " I ' m hungry , " he announced around six . He called up a Chinese restaurant . " Hi , this is Ray Gruliow , " he said , and ordered several dishes , along with a couple of bottles of Tsing-tao , telling them not to forget the fortune cookies this time . " Because , " he said , " my friend and I need to know what the future holds . " He hung up and said , " You 're in the program , right ? " " The program ? " " Do n't be coy , huh ?

" " Nobody told me , Gruliow , get your ass out of here , you do n't belong . ' And I heard things I identified with . " " But you did n't stay . " He shook his head .

There were nights I drank too much and mornings when I regretted it , but it seemed to me that was a price I could afford to pay . So I made a conscious effort to cut back on my drinking . " " And it worked ? " He nodded . " I 'm feeling the drinks I had just now . That 's why I ordered food . I do n't usually have this much to drink before dinner . I 've had some stress lately . I think it 's only natural to drink more at times of stress , do n't you ? " I said that sounded reasonable . " I would n't have brought it up , " he said , " but I did n't want to order beer for you if you were the nondrinker I understood you to be , nor did I want to appear inhospitable .

" When the club first met , Michelle was still in diapers . Jesus , she was the age Chatham is now . " " Chatham 's your daughter ? " " Indeed she is . I 'm even beginning to get used to her name . Her mother 's idea , as you no doubt assumed . A man in his sixties does not name his daughter Chatham . I suggested to Michelle that if she wanted to name the kid after an English prime minister she should give some thought to Disraeli . It goes better with Gruliow than Chatham . Dizzy Gruliow .

I do n't think I 'm going out to Sag Harbor  | tomorrow . I think the pressures of work are going to prove too great for me . " We ate in the front room , with the plates balanced on our laps . He found a Coke for me and drank his two bottles of Chinese beer . He said , " It 's funny . It was Homer 's death that shocked me .

Fear , fear of dying . They say man 's the only animal that knows he 's going to die . He 's also the only animal that drinks . " " You think there 's a connection ? " " I 'm not even sure I buy the first part . I 've had cats , and I always had the feeling they were as aware of their mortality as I 've ever been of mine . The difference is they 're fearless .

" " You know , " he said , " that was n't even a shock . One year he did n't show up for the dinner and we learned he was in the service . The next year we learned he was dead . I think I expected it . " " Because he was in combat ? " " That must have been part of it . That fucking war . Whenever somebody went over there , you figured he was n't coming back . It was easy to feel that way about Severance . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it seems to me that there was something about him . An aura , an energy , whatever you want to call it .

I try to picture him now and I ca n't bring the image into focus . But it seems to me that he was on a different level from the rest of us . " " How ? " " A lower link on the food chain .

He did n't have the chance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death held no fear for me . I was n't slogging through rice paddies getting shot at by little guys in black pajamas . I was busy helping other young men stay out of the army . " He put his glass on the table . " Then Homer Champney died , " he said , " and in a sense the party was over . " " Because you thought he was going to live forever ? " " Hardly that . I knew he was mortal , like everybody else . And I knew he was failing . So I had no reason to be shocked . When a man in his nineties dies in his sleep , it 's not a tragedy and it ca n't come as a great surprise . But you have to understand that he was a remarkably dynamic human being . " " So I gather .

How are we gon na keep up with the fucking Russians if we 're dicking around with flavored tea while they 're building tanks and going to the moon ?

" " No . " He thought about it . Then he said , " He was , as I said , very troubled by that crime . After all , it had occurred on his watch . There was never the slightest implication that he ought to have been able to prevent it . Each of our mobile units has a considerable area to patrol . We aim for maximum deterrent capability through maximum visibility .

We trooped back across the street with our coffee and took seats around a couple of refectory tables , and by half-past five a handful of others had straggled in and the meeting got under way .

In no time at all she 'd lost everything but her rent-controlled apartment and the Social Security check that enabled her to pay the rent . " I was rooting around in garbage cans , " she said . " I was waking up in strange places , and not always alone . And I was a well brought-up Irish Catholic girl who never slept with anybody but my husband . I remember coming out of a blackout one time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I was doing it to , but all I could think was , Oh , Peggy , the nuns would not be proud of you now ! ' " After she was done we passed the basket and went around the room . When it was my turn I found myself talking about how I 'd gone looking for a security guard and found he 'd been dismissed  | for drinking . " I had a strong sense of identification , " I said . " My own drinking picked up after I left the police force . If I 'd kept on drinking any longer than I did I 'd have gone after jobs like this man 's , and I 'd have drunk my way out of them , too . I do n't really know anything about him or what his life 's like , but thinking about him has given me an idea of what my own life could have been like if I had n't found this program . I 'm just glad to be here , glad to be sober . " I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others and we continued informally the sharing we 'd done at the meeting . I tried Shorter 's number when we arrived at the coffee shop and tried it again fifteen minutes later . I tried it a third time on my way out , which must have been a few minutes after seven . When my quarter came back once again I used it to call Elaine . There were no messages for me , she said , and the mail had held nothing of interest . I told her what I was up to , and that I might be out most of the evening . " If he had an answering machine , " I said , " I 'd leave a message on it and call him again in a day or two if I did n't hear from him . But he does n't , and I 'm in the neighborhood , and it 's not a neighborhood I get to often . " " You do n't have to explain it to me . " " I 'm explaining it to myself . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any answers . Any question I 've got , the Forest Hills cops already asked . So how could he have anything for me ? " " Maybe you 've got something for him . " " What do you mean ? " " Nothing really . Well , there 's a lecture and slide show at the French church . I might go to that , and if Monica wants to go with me maybe we 'll have a Girls ' Night Out afterward . You 'll be having a late night , wo n't you ? " " I might . " " Because you were going to drop in on Mick , were n't you ? Just so you 're home in time for Marilyn 's Chamber tomorrow night . " " You still want to go ? " " After the time we had last night ? " I could picture the expression on her face . " Now more than ever . You 're pretty hot stuff , Mr. Scudder , sir . " " Now cut that out . " A LONG LINE OF DEAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know who you sound like ? Jack Benny . " " I was trying to sound like Jack Benny . " " Well , in that case , it was n't a very good imitation . " " You just said ? " " I know what I said . I love you , you old bear . What have you got to say about that ? " North of Eighty-sixth Street , the landscape on the Upper East Side is one of a neighborhood in transition , neither Yorkville nor East Harlem but reminiscent of both . Luxury condos rise across the street from low-income public-housing projects , the walls of both impartially scarred by unreadable graffiti . The upwardly mobile stride along with briefcases and grocery bags from D'Agosti-no 's ; others , no less mobile but headed in the opposite direction , shake paper cups of change and drink forty-ounce bottles of malt liquor , or suck on crack pipes that glow like fireflies . Shorter 's building turned out to be a six-story brick tenement on Ninety-fourth between Second and Third . In the vestibule I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for the tenant 's name . More than half the slots were empty , and none had Shorter 's name on it . Originally the building would have had four rooms to a floor , but over the years they 'd been partitioned and the apartment house turned into a rooming house . I 'd been in and out of hundreds of such places over the years , and if each was different they were still somehow all the same . The cooking smells in the halls and stairwells changed with the ethnic origin of the inhabitants , but the other smells were a constant throughout the city and through the years . The reek of urine , the odor of mice , the unventilated stench of neglect . Now and then a room in one of those rabbit warrens would turn out to be bright and airy , clean and trim , but the buildings themselves were always dark and sorry and sordid . Something like that would have been my next stop after the hotel . If I had n't stopped drinking , the day would have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into carrying me until I caught a break . Or I 'd have reached a point where , money or no , I no longer had the self-esteem to walk past the desk each day , and would have looked for something more in keeping with my sta-tion.  | I asked a man on his way out of the building if he knew a James Shorter . He did n't even slow down , just shook his head no and kept walking . I asked the same question of a little gray-haired woman who was on her way into the building , walking with a cane and carrying her groceries in one of those mesh bags . She said she did n't know anyone in the building but that they all seemed to be very nice people . Her breath smelled of mint and booze  --  peppermint schnapps , I suppose , or a beaker of gin with a breath mint for a chaser . I walked to Second Avenue and tried Shorter 's number from a pay phone on the corner . No answer . It struck me that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a drink , and the neighborhood afforded plenty of opportunities . There were half a dozen taverns on Second within two blocks of Ninety-fourth Street . I worked my way through them , asking bartenders for James Shorter . Was he in ? Had he been in earlier ? Nobody knew him , at least not by name , but the bearded fellow behind the stick at O'Bannion 's said he 'd heard precious few last names over the years , and not that many first names , either . " He could be one of these lads , for all I know , " he said . I considered calling out his name . " James Shorter ? Is James Shorter here ? " But then I 'd have had to repeat the process in the saloons I 'd already covered , and I did n't feel like it . I 'd had enough of their boozy ambience . And how about the gin joints on First Avenue ? Should n't I go ask for the elusive Mr. Shorter there ? I might have , but first I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him my name , said I 'd got his from the police and his address and phone from Mr. Banszak at Queensboro-Corona . " I know you 've been over this plenty of times , " I said , " but I 'd appreciate a few minutes of your time . I 'm in your neighborhood right now , as it happens , so if I could come by and see you ? " " Oh , let 's meet somewhere , " he suggested . " There 's a nice place around the corner on First Avenue , the Blue Canoe . It 's a good place to talk . Say ten minutes ? " The Blue Canoe was paneled to look like a log cabin . There were a couple of trophy heads on the wall , a stuffed marlin displayed above the mirrored hack bar . The lighting was subdued and indi-A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 151  | rect , the taped music a mix of jazz and soft rock . The crowd was light and upscale for the neighborhood . I stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to a table where a man sat alone with a glass of beer . I said , " Mr. Shorter ? " but I already knew that 's who he was . I 'd waited for him across the street from his rooming house and tagged him to the bar , then gave him time to settle in before making my own entrance . Old habits die hard , I guess . We shook hands and I took the seat across from him . I 'd formed a mental picture of him  --  the mind will do that , helpfully conjuring up an image to fit the sense one has of a person . People do n't usually wind up looking much like I 've pictured them , and he was no exception , being older , darker , and , yes , shorter than I 'd had in mind . Late forties , I figured . Five-eight , wiry , with a round face and deep-set eyes . A pug nose , a narrow-lipped mouth . No beard or mustache , but a good two days ' worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black in the dim light of the Blue Canoe , cut short and combed flat on his round skull . He was wearing a T-shirt , and had a lot of dark hair on his forearms and the backs of his wrists . " It must have been a shock , " I said . " Finding Watson 's body . " " A shock ? Jesus , I 'll say . " The waitress came and I ordered a Coke . Then I took out my notebook and we started going over his story . There was n't a lot to get . He 'd gone over it repeatedly with detectives from Queens Homicide and the One-one-two , and he 'd had close to five months to forget anything he might have left out . No , he had n't seen anybody suspicious in the neighborhood . No , he had n't spotted Alan Watson earlier on , heading home from the bus stop . No , he could n't think of anything , not a damn thing . " How come you 're checking now ? " he wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " " Are you from a different precinct or what ? " Ile 'd assumed I was a cop , an assumption I 'd been perfectly willing for him to make . But now I told him I was private . " Oh , " he said . " But you 're not with Q- ( : , are you ? " " Qucenshoro-Corona ? No , I 'm independent . "  | " And you 're investigating a mugging in Forest Hills ? Who hired you , the victim 's widow ? " " No . " " Somebody else ? " " A friend of his . " " Of Watson 's ? " " That 's right . " He caught the waitress 's eye and ordered another beer . I did n't much want another Coke but I ordered one anyway . Shorter said , " I guess people with money see things differently . I was just thinking how if a friend of mine got stabbed on the street , would I hire detectives to find out who did it ? " He shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I ca n't really talk about my client . " " No , I can understand that , " he said . The waitress brought the drinks and he said , " I guess it 's your own policy , then . Not drinking on duty . " " How 's that ? " " Well , like if you were a cop , you would n't be drinking on duty . Or private , either , if you worked for somebody like Q-C . But working independent , you can judge for yourself whether you should be having a drink or not having a drink , right ? So you 're ordering Coke , I figure it has to be your own policy . " " Is that what you figure ? " " Or maybe you just like Coca-Cola . " " It 's all right , but I ca n't say I 'm crazy about it . See , I do n't drink . " " Oh . " " But I used to . " " Yeah ? " " I loved it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I probably drank enough beer over the years to float a light cruiser . Do you have a law-enforcement background yourself , Mr. Shorter ? " He shook his head . " Well , I do . I was a cop , a detective . I drank myself off the police force . " " Is that right ? " " I never got in trouble for it , " I said . " Not directly , but I would have the way I was going . I walked away from it , the job , my wife and kids , my whole life A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 153  | I do n't see what he could have for me , I 'd told Elaine . Maybe you 've got something for him , she 'd said . Maybe I did . The way it works is remarkably simple . A day at a time , you do n't drink . You go to meetings and share your experience , strength , and hope with your fellow alcoholics . And you carry the message . You do that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own story  --  what it used to be like , what happened , and what it 's like now . That 's what you do when you lead a meeting , and it 's what you do one-on-one . So I told my story . When I was done he picked up his glass . He looked at it and put it down again . He said , " I drank myself out of the job at Q-C . But I guess you know that . " " It was mentioned . " " I was kind of shook , finding the body and all . Not the sort of thing I 'm used to , you know what I mean ? " " Sure . " " So I was hitting it a little heavy for a while there . It happens , right ? " " It does . " " General rule , I do n't drink that much . " " They say it 's not how much you drink , " I said . " It 's what it does for you . " " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Lets me relax , unwind , get some thinking done . That 's some of what it does for me . " " Uh-huh . How about what it does to you ? " " Ha , " he said . " Now that 's something else , is n't it ? " He picked the glass up again , put the glass down again . " I guess you 're pretty strong on this AA stuff , huh ? " " It saved my life . " " You been sober awhile , huh ? Two , three years ? " " More like ten . " " Jesus , " he said . " No , uh , little vacations along the way ? " " Not so far . " I le nodded , taking it in . " Ten years , " he said . " You do it a day at a time , " I told him . " It tends to add up . " " You still go to the meetings after all this time ? How often do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day . Sometimes I went to two or three meetings a day during the early years . I 'll still go every day when I feel like drinking , or if I 'm under a lot of stress . And sometimes I 'll let my attendance drop to one or two meetings a week . Most of the time , though , I go to three or four meetings a week . " " Even after all these years . Where do you find the time ? " " Well , I always had time to drink . " " Yeah , I guess drinking does pass the time , does n't it ? " " And it 's easy to find meetings that fit into my schedule . That 's a nice thing about New York , there are meetings around the clock . " " Oh , yeah ? " I nodded . " All over town , " I said . " There 's a group on Houston Street that has a meeting every day at midnight and another at two in the morning . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's most notorious after-hours joints for years . They stayed open late then and they still do today . " He thought that was pretty funny . I excused myself and went to the john , stopping on the way back to use the phone . I was pretty sure there was a late meeting on East Eighty-second Street , but I wanted to make sure of the time and the exact address . I called Intergroup , and the woman who answered the phone did n't even have to look it up . Back at our table , Shorter was still looking at the same halfounce of beer . I told him there was a meeting in the neighborhood at ten o'clock and that I thought I would probably go to it . I had n't been to a meeting in a couple of days , I told him , which was a lie . I could use a meeting , I said , which was true . " You want to go , Jim ? " " Me ? " Who else ? " Come on , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know , " he said . " I just had these beers , and I had one or two earlier . " " So ? " " Do n't you have to be sober ? " " Just so you do n't start shouting and throwing chairs , " I said . " But I do n't think you 're likely to do that , are you ? " " No , but ? " " It does n't cost anything , " I said , " and the coffee and cookies u. ?  --  ? ? ?

"  | The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue . An AA group had rented the second floor and held half a dozen meetings there every day , starting at seven in the morning and ending at eleven . In concession to their residential neighbors , there was no applause at the late meeting ; one indicated approval or enthusiasm by snapping one 's fingers . The speaker was a construction worker with five years ' sobriety , and he told a basic , straightforward drinking story and told it succinctly , wrapping it up in twenty minutes . Then there was a break with announcements and the passing of the basket , and then we continued with a show of hands . I was glad of that . All he had to do was keep his hands in his lap and he would n't have to say anything . No reason he should be put on the spot at his first meeting , the way he would be if they went around the room . When I first came in , the last thing I wanted was to open my mouth in a roomful of alcoholics . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Matt , I said , time and time again . 1 pass . I 'd have a dozen things buzzing around in my head , but none of them made it past my lips . My name is Matt . Thanks fur your qualification . I 'll just listen tonight . A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 157  | At eleven we went downstairs and out . I suggested a cup of coffee and he said that sounded good . We walked to Eighty-sixth , where there was a diner he liked . I was hungry enough to order a grilled-cheese sandwich and an order of onion rings . He just wanted coffee . He said , " I almost raised my hand . I was this close . " " You can , any time you want . But you do n't have to . " " People say anything , do n't they ? I thought what one person said would relate to what the person before him said , but it does n't necessarily work that way , does it ?

" What about God , he wondered . What about the sign on the wall , the list of the twelve suggested steps . You just do n't drink , I told him , and you come to meetings , and you keep an open mind . Did I believe in God ? Some of the time , I said . I did n't have to believe in God all the time . The only thing I had to do every minute of every day was not pick up a drink . He said , " I should n't be keeping you . You 've probably got things to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jim . " " You know , I was thinking . In the meeting , because I would be listening to somebody and my mind would wander . I was thinking about Alan Watson . The guy who got stabbed ? " " And ? " " It seems to me there 's something nagging at my memory but I ca n't get ahold of it . " " Maybe if we go through that evening step by step , " I said . " I do n't know . Maybe it 'll just come to me . You say this friend of his thinks it was n't just a random mugging ? " " That 's what I 'm trying to determine . " " Why , is there someone had a reason to kill him ?

" " And the accidents could be legit , " he said . " I get it . Are you making much headway ? " " I ca n't really ? " " ? go into details , right . I 'm sorry . I 'm just trying to get an idea what it is I should be trying to remember . You know , I just took it for granted it was a mugging , what I guess they 'd call a crime of opportunity . I think one of the cops used that phrase , meaning the mugger was out there looking to score a few dollars from somebody , and Mr. Watson came along , good neighborhood , looked like he belonged there , suit and tie , obviously a professional man coming home from work , figure he 'll have a good watch on his arm and some big hills in his wallet .

" A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 159  | " Then you 'd have somebody lurking in the neighborhood , " he said . " I do n't remember seeing anything like that , but I do n't know if it 's something I 'd notice . Some sleazebag with dirty clothes and a scruffy beard skulking around in the shadows , well , yeah , part of my job was to spot people like that and either roust them myself or call nine-one-one and drop a dime on them . But the guy you 're looking for would n't operate like that , would he ? " " Probably not . " " He 'd probably be dressed decent , " he said , " and he 'd want to be able to keep an eye on Watson 's house , or on the approach to it . And , come to think of it , he 'd most likely be in a car , would n't he ? You think mugger , you picture a guy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have his own car , right ? " " It 's very possible . " " Was there a car parked in the neighborhood ? Now there were plenty of cars , so the real question is was there anybody sitting in a parked car , and the answer is I would never have noticed something like that . What 's the guy look like , the guy you 're after ? " " No idea . " " You do n't have a suspect in mind , huh ? Or a physical descrip-tion ? " I shook my head . " So if he had a car ? " " No idea of the make or model or plate number . " " What I figured , Matt . " " Or even if he had a car , " I said . " See , if I knew who did it , I 'd be coming at it from another angle entirely . " " Yeah , I see what you mean . " We talked a little about the nature of detection , about the ways I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a police background but the time he 'd spent doing guard work and street patrol had left him with an interest in the subject , and he asked good questions and caught on quickly . The conversation died down when the waiter came around to refill our cups , and when it resumed the topic shifted to AA and alcoholism and where Jim might decide to go from here . " I do n't know if I 'm an alcoholic , " he said earnestly . " I heard a lot tonight that was interesting , but there 's plenty that happened to the speaker that never happened to me . I was never hospitalized , I was never in a detox or a rehab . " " On the other hand , he never lost a job because of his drinking . " " Yeah , and I did . No argument there .

That makes them more fun to be around , and a lot less likely to throw up on your shoes . " At the meeting we 'd just attended , I 'd bought a meeting book during the secretary 's break , and I went through it now with him , pointing out some meetings in his neighborhood . He asked me which ones I went to , and I told him I went mostly in my neighborhood . " Every meeting has its own style , " I said . " If you try different ones you 'll find out which one suits you best . " " Like different bars . " I gave him my card , one of the minimalist ones with my name and phone number .

Elaine 's Girls ' Night Out had evidently had an early ending ; she was sleeping soundly , and did n't stir when I got in beside her . I was ex-hausted  --  it had been a long day  --  but the time I 'd spent with Jim Shorter had energized me , leaving me tired but wired . My mind was all over the place , and I thought I was going to have to get up and read or watch television to unwind . I was bracing myself to do just that when sleep came along and took me by surprise . Over breakfast I told her how I 'd spent the evening . " I do n't know if he 'll ever get to another meeting , " I said , " let alone get sober and stay sober . He says he did n't drink that much and it did n't screw him up that badly , and for all I know he 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good .

" " I 'm glad you pointed that out to me . " " So enjoy yourself with the widow . What 's the matter ? Did I say something wrong ? " " No , of course not . Although I ca n't say I expect to enjoy it . " " Whatever , darling . Just so you 're back here by eight this evening . We 've got a date , remember ? " " You still want to go ? " " Uh-huh . We should get there by ten , and we 'll want to have dinner first . Should I cook something for us or do you want to eat someplace downtown ?

" I went across the street to my hotel , collected my mail at the desk , went upstairs , and called the number I had for Alan Watson . It rang ten times , unanswered by human being or machine . I sorted my mail , threw out most of it , wrote checks for the rent and phone bill , checked the number with Queens Information to make sure I had it right , then dialed it again and listened to it ring another eight or ten times . I broke the connection and called Lewis Hildebrand . The woman who answered told me he was working and offered to give me his office number . I told her I already had it , and when I dialed Hildebrand answered it himself .

" " But you 're the man who hired me , so I wanted to give you a preliminary report .

No one was anxiously early or fashionably late . The first to arrive were Gerard Billings and Kendall McGarry , who came in separate taxis that discharged their passengers simultaneously . The two men rang Gruliow 's bell at five minutes before the hour . They had no sooner taken seats than the bell rang again . When Bob Berk arrived at 3:02 , apologizing for being late , he was the ninth man . It was five minutes after three when Ray Gruliow got to his feet to open the meeting .

What he had not done before , what no one had done , was open a meeting at other than the traditional time and place . He had given some thought to the form this meeting ought to take , and had consulted several of the others on the matter . His conclusion was that it ought to vary as little as possible from the usual form , and he began accordingly by intoning the names of deceased members in the order of their passing , beginning with Philip Michael A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 179  | Kalish and James Severance and Homer Gray Champney , concluding in due course with Francis DiGiulio and Alan Walter Watson . " I want to thank you for coming , " he said . " I 've talked with each of you about the situation we 're facing , and I know some of you have talked to one another . Let me see if I can summarize what we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in our usual fashion and get a sense of where we are on this . There 's a fellow who 'll be joining us at three-thirty , a detective by the name of Scudder . It would be good if we could reach some sort of consensus by the time he gets here . . . . " I got to Commerce Street fifteen minutes early and killed the time wandering the narrow winding streets . It took me back to when I was a new face at the Sixth Precinct , itself housed on Charles Street in those days . I was new to the Village , and excited by what I saw , but 1 kept getting lost on those eccentric streets . I thought I 'd never get the hang of it , but nothing familiarizes you with an area like a tour of duty there . I caught on . At 3:30 exactly I mounted the steps at Gruliow 's house and worked the lion 's head door knocker . Gruliow opened the door at once and met me with a smile , one he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two shared a secret . " You 're right on time , " he said . " Come on in . There 's a bunch of fellows here who want to meet you . " The heat notwithstanding , I was glad I 'd worn a suit . They were all in dark business suits , except for Lowell Hunter , whose suit was seersucker , and Gerard Billings , the TV weatherman , with his trademark bow tie and a Kelly-green blazer . Gruliow introduced me and I shook hands all around , trying to fix each face in my mind and match it with a name I already knew . I did n't have that many to remember ; of the nine , I had already met Gruliow and f lilck:brand , and I recognized Billings and Avery Davis . That left I hinter , along with Bob Berk , Bill Ludgate , Kendall McGarry , and ( , ordon Walser .

Bob Ripley was in Ohio to attend a daughter 's college graduation , while Douglas  | Pomeroy and Rick Bazerian had business appointments they 'd been unable to reschedule . After the introductions we all took our seats and they all waited for me to say something . I looked around at the ring of expectant faces and all I could think of was that I wanted a drink . I took a deep breath and let it out and pushed the thought aside . I told them I was grateful to them for the meeting . " I know you 've had a little time to discuss the situation , " I said , " but I thought I might tell you what it looks like from my perspective , which is that of an outsider and a professional investigator . " I talked for fifteen or twenty minutes , discussing the various deaths in turn , speculating on the probable legitimacy of the suicides and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I did n't trip over my own tongue and I guess I made some sort of sense . From the looks on their faces , they were hanging on every word . " Where we go from here , " I said , " is up to you gentlemen . Before I list the alternatives , I 'd like to use this conference for another purpose and take advantage of the opportunity to ask you some questions . " " Like what ? " Gruliow wanted to know . " Your club 's had a death rate well in excess of average . That 's what prompted Lew to hire me . I wonder how many of you were similarly disturbed at the number of deaths , and if the possibility of murder ever suggested itself to you . " Kendall McGarry , one of whose ancestors had signed the Declaration of Independence , said he 'd had exactly that thought , and that it had come to him a full two years ago . " But I dismissed it at once as fanciful and preposterous , the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for television but utterly incredible in real life . " Bob Berk confessed to a similar fleeting thought . Gordon Walser , who 'd announced at the very first meeting that he 'd been born with an extra finger on each hand , said that he 'd lost both parents and several other family members over the past decade , and that this may have kept him unaware of the club 's high death rate . Similarly , Lowell Hunter had lost " more friends than I could count " to AIDS ; the club 's death rate , he could assure us , was considerably lower than that of his own social circle . Gerard Billings said he 'd have been bothered more if a higher proportion of the deaths had been the result of illness . " That 's A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 181  | threatening , " he said . " Cancer , heart attacks , all those little time bombs in your cells and blood vessels . Those are the things that scare you . Suicide , though , that 's a choice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A private plane crash , well , I do n't fly my own plane , so how 's that going to happen to me ? As far as mur-der 's concerned , that 's like getting struck by lightning . It happens to other people . You stay out of bad neighborhoods , you keep your hands off other men 's wives , you do n't walk through Central Park at night , and you do n't mess around with Jim . You know , the Jim Croce song ? " He sang a few bars , his voice trailing off as the others stared at him . Bill Ludgate said he 'd been acutely aware of the high death rate , but that it had never made him suspicious . He 'd just been bothered by the realization that his generation had started to die off , and that he himself might be closer to the end of life than he 'd thought . Avery Davis said , " You know , I took the same thought and went in the opposite direction with it . I figured the fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they were dead , then my odds of hanging around for a while were that much better . Which is nonsense when you think about it , but it seemed almost logical at the time . " I asked if any of them had noticed anything suspicious . Any sense that they were being followed or stalked ? Any strings of wrong numbers , or callers who rang off without identifying them-selves ? No one had anything substantial . Bob Berk , who lived in Upper Montclair , New Jersey , said there had been a lot of clicking and static on his residential phone line for a while , almost as if it were tapped , but that the problem had cleared up several months ago as inexplicably as it had started . Bill Ludgate said his wife had been bothered by someone calling and hanging up without saying anything , and that he 'd been on the verge of doing something about it when he happened to learn the identity of the caller ; it was a girlfriend of his , trying to reach him at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . But the affair was over , Ludgate said , and the calls had stopped . I asked a few more questions . I did n't tell them this , but I was less interested in the information they could give me than in the sense I got of who they were . I knew where they lived , I knew how old they were , I knew what they did for a living and how good a  | living it brought them , but I wanted some sense of who they were as individuals . I was n't sure what I wanted with it . When they were out of answers and I was out of fresh questions , I reviewed their options . They could go to the police , starting either with Joe Durkin , who knew a little about their situation , or anywhere else in the chain of command . If they were n't happy with the response they received , or if they wanted to ensure a full-scale high-priority investigation from the jump , they could go directly to the media . Or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads , and waiting for some kind of break . That would keep the spotlight off the club , and keep everybody 's name out of the paper , but it might not get anywhere . Still , I 'd have certain recommendations to make regarding personal security , and they 'd be able to function as auxiliary investigators , keeping in contact and reporting anything irregular or suspicious the minute they noticed it . " There 's no guarantee I 'll get anywhere , " I told them . " But the cops ca n't give you a guarantee , either . And they 'll turn your lives inside out . " " Because of the media attention , you mean ? " " Even without that . If I were a cop , you know the first thing I 'd do ? I 'd ask each of you to account for your whereabouts on the night in February when Alan Watson was murdered . " A couple of them reacted visibly ; it had not yet struck them that they were suspects . " Maybe you should anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five men who could n't make it . " I shook my head . " Why not ? " " Because I have n't got the resources to check your alibis effectively . Personally , I do n't think the police would crack this by checking alibis . My guess is that there 'd be a few of you who 'd he unable to prove you could n't have followed Watson home and killed him . That 's no indicator of guilt . As a matter of fact , who ever did kill Watson might very well have an alibi in reserve , and it might be impossible to disprove . But the cops would have to check everything out , because you ca n't leave a single stone unturned in an official investigation . Especially when the case has a high profile . " ( ; ruliow said , " What 's your recommendation , Matt ? " A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 183  | " I do n't have one . How can I recommend anything ? You gentlemen have to make the call . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And if it were your neck ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " It 's easy to argue either side . It would seem obvious that the safest course is to go public right away , but I 'm not sure that 's so . This is a very patient killer . What would he do if the police gave the investigation priority and the newspapers splashed it all over the front page ? My guess is he 'd crawl in a hole and lay low . He 's in no hurry , he has n't got a train to catch . He can afford to wait a year or two . Then , when everybody 's convinced he never existed in the first place , he can select his victim and kill again . " " For God 's sake , why ? " Lowell Hunter demanded . " It 's not one of us , is it ? It ca n't be . " " I ca n't believe it 's anybody in this room , " Bob Berk said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ripley or Pomeroy or Brian O'Hara or  --  who else ? John Youngdahl ? Rick Bazerian ? " " No . " " If it 's one of us , " Bill Ludgate said , " that means one of us is crazy . Not a little bit eccentric , not marching to a different drummer , but genuinely nuts . I only see you fellows once a year , but I think you 're all relatively sane . " " Can I quote you on that , Billy ? " " So it has to be someone outside the club , " he continued , " but who could possibly want to kill us ? Who even knows we exist , for Christ 's sake ? " " An ex-wife , " Ray Gruliow said . " How many of us have been divorced ? " " Why would an ex-wife want to ? " " I do n't know . Alienation of affections ? Who the hell knows why an ex-wife would do anything ? But we 're spinning our wheels new , are n't we ? We came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do that before we do anything else . " He turned to me . " Matt , " he said , " would you mind giving us ten minutes to figure out how we want to handle this ? You 're welcome to wait upstairs , there 's a bedroom where you could stretch out if you want . " I said I 'd just as soon get sonic fresh air , which turned out to he . t particularly inappropriate figure of speech ; when I left Gruliow 's centrally air-conditioned house , the airless heat hit me with phys-  | ical force . I stood on the top step for a moment to get my bearings . Across the street , a black limousine was parked in front of the Cherry Lane Theater . The driver was leaning against the fender and smoking a cigarette . For a moment I thought he was staring at me , but his eyes did n't follow me when I came down the stairs , and I realized he was looking at the door to see if anyone else was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , " I called to him . " Mini-mum . " He shot me a guarded look ; he was glad to have the information but did n't think it was appropriate for me to talk to him . Well , fuck you , I thought , and walked down the street to where I could get a look at the back of the limo . ABD-1 , the license plate read . I decided the limo belonged to Avery Blanchard Davis , and gave myself credit for having figured something out . It was about time . It was 4:19 when I walked out of Gruliow 's house and just past 4:30 when the front door opened again and Hard-Way Ray stepped out and looked first to his left and then to his right . He did n't see me . I had walked to Seventh Avenue and picked up an iced coffee at a deli , then perched on the stoop of an apartment house across the street to drink it . Davis 's chauffeur had finished his cigarette by then and disappeared behind the limo 's tinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels , except for one redheaded kid on a skateboard who zoomed around the corner from Bedford Street , raced on past me and around the bend , and disappeared forever . I finished my coffee and flipped the cup into an uncovered garbage can . Then the door opened across the street and Gruliow came out and looked for me and did n't see me . I got up , and the movement caught Gruliow 's attention . He beckoned and I let a car pass , then walked on across the street . Meanwhile he 'd come down the steps to meet me on the sidewalk . " We 'd like you to stay with it , " he said . " If you 're sure . " " Let 's go back inside , " he said , " so I can tell you officially . "  | " They each put up a thousand dollars , " I told Elaine . " The ones who 'd brought their checkbooks along wrote out checks , and the rest handed over markers . " " You had to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " And their checks . He 's the one they hired . They engaged him collectively as their legal counsel . " " What are they going to do , sue the murderer ? " " And Gruliow hired me . He gave me a check drawn on his office account for nine thousand dollars , which represents the checks and markers he received from the others plus a thousand dollars of his own . " " So you 're working for him ? " I shook my head . " I 've been hired by him , " I said , " to conduct an investigation in his client 's interest , his client being the group as a whole . The point of this , according to him , is to get me under the umbrella of attorney-client privilege . " " What does that mean ? You can refuse to answer questions in court ? " " I do n't think anybody 's concerned about that . No , it means I 'm not hound to divulge the results of my investigation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me by my employer , Gruliow , or his clients . " " Does that really cover you ? " " I do n't know . Gruliow seemed to think it does . In any case , if I should feel it was appropriate for me to withhold information from the police , I 'd do it irrespective of the legal ramifications . So it ca n't hurt to have whatever shield attorney-client privilege provides , but I 'm going to do the same thing with or without it . " " My hero , " she said . " He 'll do anything for a client . " " Not exactly , " I said , " because I told them I reserved the option of bringing the cops in at any point . My main concern is stopping this guy before there are any more killings . " " That 's their concern , too , is n't it ? " " You 'd think so , would n't you ? I do n't know what was said while I was sitting on the stoop across the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping the club of thirtyone off tabloid television than they are in keeping their own names out of the obituary column . If the story ever breaks , that 's the end of the club . Do n't forget , it was in existence before they were born , and they expect it to survive them all . They 're not particularly eager to die for it , but they do n't want to have to live without it , either . " " Guys , " she said . " Hell , that 's not the worst of it , " I said . " Two of them were wearing identical red-and-black striped ties , and nobody said a word about it . I do n't even think they noticed . " " Shocking , " she said . " Except I do n't believe it . You 're making it up , are n't you ? " " Yes , as a matter of fact . How 'd you know ? " " Because you would n't have noticed either , you bear . " " I might . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties . " " Whose ties ? " " Everybody 's ties . " " Well , Gerry Billings was wearing a bow tie . " " He always wears a how tie . What color ? " Uh ? " " And do n't make something up.Do you remember any of their ties ? " A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 187  | " Uh-huh . And some were n't . " " I had more important things on my mind , " I said , " than ties . " " Right , " she said . " I rest my case . " Before I took Gruliow 's check I talked to them about security . " What you have to do , " I said , " is pay attention to things you 're in the habit of overlooking , or taking for granted . Is someone following you on the street ? Is the same car circling your block over and over , or staked out across the street from your house ? Are you getting a rash of suspicious phone calls ? Is there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batch of clicks along with abrupt changes in volume ? " " Paranoia time , " someone said . " A certain degree of paranoia 's part of life in our times , " I said . " You people have a right to be a little more paranoid than the norm . You 've just paid out a thousand dollars a man because someone 's trying to kill you . You do n't want to make it easy for him . " " What about hiring bodyguards ? " " My driver 's armed , " Avery Davis volunteered , " and the car 's bulletproof . That 's not a response to this particular threat . A couple of friends of ours were carjacked  --  Ed and Rhea Feinbock ? " " I read about that , " Bill Ludgate said . " Well , I heard about it firsthand , from Ed . The sons of bitches pistol-whipped him . And then I read about other instances , and I bought a limo and hired a pro to drive it . While I was at it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he leap into the line of fire ? " Bob Berk wanted to know . " Will he take a bullet for you , Avery ? " " I would n't think so , not for what I 'm paying him . " I said , " I do n't want to talk anybody out of employing bodyguards , but I do n't think the situation warrants it . I think it 's more important for you to live defensively than that you hire someone to defend you . You 're going to have to keep your guard up all the tune . " " By checking to see if we 're being followed ? " " Among other things . Remember how Ian Heller died . " " dumped in front of a subway , " someone said . " Jumped or fell , " I said , " and let 's assume for the moment he was rushed . The cop on the case has spent enough time under  | ground to be very cautious himself on subway platforms . He 's wary of ambulatory psychotics , careful not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platform . But that kind of caution alone would n't have protected Ian Heller . " " Why not ? " " Suppose it was someone Heller knew . Suppose it was a friend of his . " " You 're saying it was one of us , " Ken McGarry said . " Not necessarily , although I ca n't rule it out . You did n't all automatically clear yourselves by writing out a thousand-dollar check . But let 's say Heller was in the subway , waiting for a train , and someone approached him . " " Someone he knew ? " " Someone who knew him , " I said . " Someone who called him by name . You 're Ian Heller , are n't you ? You do n't remember me , but we met at So-and-so 's party . ' He 'd know enough about Heller to find a pretext for conversation . Heller would n't worry about getting shoved in front of a train . If anything , he 'd feel more secure than he 'd felt a few minutes ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially dangerous strangers . He had a friend with him . " Gordon Walser said it was diabolical . Lowell Hunter said , " You know , it reminds me of The Godfather . The attack when it comes will be from someone you trust , someone you would never doubt for a moment . That 's who they 'll use . ' " " That 's how he must do it , " I said . " In a way , Ian Heller was a bad example . His death occurred during rush hour . The platform was crowded , and anybody could have positioned himself properly and given him a well-timed shove . But it could have happened at an off-hour in an empty station , just the way I described it . " " So we 'll stay away from subways , " someone said . " What you ought to do , " I suggested , " is think of the killer more as a confidence man than a wild-eyed assassin . Think of him stalking Alan Watson on his way home , then conveniently running into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Alan , how are you ? You walking home ? I 'm going the same way , I 'll keep you company . ' Even if Watson had never seen the guy before , he 'd have to assume he was a neighbor , someone he 'd met and forgotten . And they probably had a very pleasant conversation , right up to the time when the guy snuck a knife in Watson 's chest . " A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 189  | " I do n't know if I got through to them , " I told Elaine . " A couple of them wanted to know if they ought to arm themselves . I did n't know what to tell them . They probably could n't get carry permits , certainly not in a hurry , so that would mean risking an illegalweapons charge . " " That 's better than getting killed , is n't it ? " " Of course , and these men are respectable establishment types ; if they wound up defending themselves with an illegal handgun , nobody 'd be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some perfectly innocent person asked one of them for a match , or lost his balance and lurched into one of our armed heroes ? " " Bang bang . " " I told them to call me if anything out of the ordinary happens . They 'll keep in touch with each other , too . It 's funny . " " What is ? " " The way it 's got them relating to one another . In one way they 're closer . Remember , these are fellows who 've shared a very intimate association for over thirty years  --  but only one night a year . They 're united by deep and longstanding bonds of brotherhood , but they do n't really know each other . " " And ? " " And now things have changed , and nothing brings you together like the need to defend yourselves against a common enemy . But at the same time , the enemy might be one of them . " " Did n't Pogo have something to say about that ? " " We have met the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't met the enemy , not head-on . He may be one of us and he may not . So ? " " So they 're closely bonded but a little uneasy about it . " " Something like that . For the first time ever they have to maintain contact with one another . And , also for the first time , they do n't dare trust each other . It 's like Cannibals and Christians . " She looked bewildered . " You know , Cannibals and Christians . It 's a logic problem , you 've got six people trying to cross a river , three cannibals and three Christians , and the boat only holds three people and you ca n't have one Christian left alone with two cannibals or he 'll get eaten .

" So you met Gerry Billings , " Elaine said . " I hope you asked him if he could do anything about this weather . " " God , he must get sick of hearing that . " " If he does n't get sick of pointing at the wall and talking about warm fronts and cold fronts , he probably does n't ever get sick of anything .

" He poured coffee for me and I carried it to the table where Mick and I usually wound up sitting , over on the side beneath the mirror advertising Tullamore Dew . Someone had left a copy of the Post on a nearby table , and I opened it to the sports section to see what the columnists had to say . I was n't much better at tracking their sentences than I 'd been at following the movie . After a while I set the paper aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late to call him ?

" " It was n't much more than a fine mist when I came here . " " I know , for was I not out in it myself ? A soft day , the Irish call it . A fucking downpour is what it 's turned into . " He rubbed his hands together , stamped his feet on the old tile floor . " Let me get  | out of these wet clothes . Catch a cold this time of the year and the fucker 's with you till Christmas .

There 's always a lot of cash in the safe , and I ca n't believe the box would be all that hard to crack . So far no one has ever been fool enough to try . He emerged from the office after a few minutes with his hair neatly combed and wearing a fresh sport shirt and slacks . He said a few words to one of the darts players , laid a gentle hand on the shoulder of an old man in a cloth cap , and slipped behind the bar to pour himself a drink . He threw down a quick shot to take the chill off , and I could almost feel the warm glow radiating outward from the solar plexus , providing comfort , warming the body and the soul . Then he refilled his glass and brought it to the table along with a fresh cup of coffee for me .

Like buying a mortgage , and deeply discounted in the bargain . " " You paid cash for it ? " " I did , and sent Andy Buckley to talk to the lad .

There is a primitive and monolithic quality to him . Years ago , a wit at Morrissey 's after-hours described Stonehenge as looking like Mick and his brothers standing in a circle . It may be fitting , then , that he is just about the last of a vanishing breed , the tough Irish criminals who have been drinking and fighting and raising hell in the West Forties and Fifties since before the Civil War . Various gangs and mobs held sway  --  the Gophers , the Rhodes Gang , the Parlor Mob , the Gorillas . A lot of their leaders were saloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priest to Owney Madden . They were as cheerfully vicious as any group New York ever saw , and they might have made a more lasting mark on the place if they had n't had such an all-consuming thirst . According to Mick , God created whiskey to keep the Irish from taking over the world . It had certainly kept the Hell 's Kitchen hoodlums from taking over the city . A few years ago some newspaper reporters started calling the current crop " the Westies , " and by the time the tag caught on there was hardly anybody left to pin it to . The neighborhood bad guys were mostly gone  --  dead of drink or violence , doing life sentences somewhere upstate , rotting away in the back wards at Manhattan State Hospital . Or they were married and living somewhere in the Jersey suburbs , getting fat and sluggish , running crooked autorepair shops , rigging the games in church Las Vegas Night fundraisers , or working all week for their fathers-in-law and drinking themselves sodden on the weekends . Mick , the son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not far from Marseilles , was a man who drank whiskey like water , a career criminal , a brutal killer who would costume himself for a night of slaughter in the butcher 's apron his father had worn , then wear the same apron to mass at St. Bernard 's . There was no reason why we should have become friends , and no way to explain our friendship . Nor could I find an explanation for these long nights of ours , when the stories flowed like water or like whiskey . He would drink for both of us , filling his glass time and time again with the twelve-year-old Jameson . I would keep him Lompany with coffee , with Coca-Cola , with soda water . Maybe as Jim Faber had suggested it was a far more  | saloon society without risking a seizure or liver damage . Maybe , as Elaine proposed , the two of us had a long karmic history together , and were just renewing the ties that had bonded us in innumerable past lives . Or perhaps , as had sometimes occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had and the road I 'd left untaken . And maybe we 're both just men who like a long night in a quiet room , and a good story or two . " You recall , " he said , " when I went to Ireland the year before last . " His lawyer , Mark Rosenstein , had sent him out of the country to avoid a subpoena . " I was going to join you , " I reminded him , " but something came up . " " Ah , we 'd have set the heather blazing , yourself and I. They 're a curious people , the Irish . Did I tell you about Paddy Meehan 's pub ? " " I do n't believe so . " " Paddy Meehan kept a public house in West Cork , " he said , " and I believe it was a right hovel , though I never saw it in those days . But your man had an uncle in Boston , and the old fellow died and left a daicent sum , as I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose . " " He did , and himself showed a cool head for business for the first time in memory . He invested the whole lot in improvements to his place of business . He had the walls paneled in knotty pine , and he had chandeliers installed and fitted with dimmer switches , and over the door he had a new electric sign hung . A right wonder it was , visible for miles . " He smiled , savoring the memory . " And he had the wooden floor covered with the finest linoleum , and bought new tables and chairs , and truly spared no expense . But most wonderful of all in this little country pub were the two new doors standing side by side on the back wall , each with a sign on it in the old Ogham script . One door was marked ' FIR , ' the Gaelic for Men , and the other MNA , ' for Women . And there were those silhouettes of a man and a woman , such as you 'll find on airport rest rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gaelic . " " He put in bathrooms . " " You would think so , would n't vou ? Quite the fellow was A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 197  | Paddy Meehan . When you walked through either door , FIR or MNA , you found yourself standing in the same five-acre field . " He told another story about Ireland , and that reminded me of something that had happened years ago at an Emerald Society dinner . The conversation found its own pace , with stretches of silence interspersed . Outside the rain poured down . " Did I ever tell you , " he wondered , " about Dennis and the cat ? " " Not that I remember . " " You would remember , " he said . " Even if ye drank you 'd not likely forget this one . Oh , he was a lad , Dennis was . " " I remember Dennis . " " We were raised decently , you know . I was the only one turned out bad . Francis became a priest . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? And John 's in White Plains , a pillar of the fucking community . " " A lawyer , is n't he ? " " Law and real estate , and it spoils his breakfast every time there 's a story about myself in his morning paper . " His green eyes sparkled at the thought . " And Dennis , " he said , " was what you 'd call happy-go-lucky . No harm in him , and no darkness , either . Of course he had a liking for the drink . " " Of course . " " He liked his few jars . Fresh out of high school he went to work for Railway Express . Midnight to eight five days a week at their central depot , and he never missed a night 's work , and he was never without a drink from the moment he punched in until he walked out into the light of dawn . Every one of them drank like that , and when they were n't drinking they were stealing , and when they were n't doing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's out of business now , and it does n't take a genius to tell you why . " " I guess not . " " But the finest thing that ever happened there , " he said , " was when they had the cat . This woman owned a prizewinning cat , a Persian , I believe it was . Onc of the longhaired sort , at any rate . She 'd had a wooden crate specially built for the cat , and brought it to one of the receiving stations for shipment to California . " " And they stole the cat ? " " Thcv did not . Whv would anyone steal a cat ? All thev did was  | drop it , crate and all . The fine crate shattered , and the cat stood in the wreckage and looked around at these drunken idjits , and in a flash it was gone . So what do you think they did ? " " What ? " " They reassembled the crate . They got a hammer and nails and put it back together again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them tell of it . But when they were done the cat had not reappeared , and who could blame her ? Well , they could hardly send an empty crate to San Diego , and so the whole crew of them stalked through the warehouse , calling Here , kitty kitty ' and making little mewing noises . " " That must have been something to see . " " If the cat saw it , " he said , " it took care not to be seen in return , for never a hair of the creature did any of them ever take sight of again . But they did find another cat , a nasty old tom blind in one eye and missing an ear , and his dirty old coat matted and scabby with mange . He made his home in the warehouse , do n't you know , living on rats . And small children , I should n't wonder . " He smiled richly at the memory . " And it was Dennis who solved the problem , " he said . " It says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he told them . She put a cat in the box , she 'll take a cat out of the box . What 's her problem ? ' And so they placed the old torn in the crate and sealed him up , and off he went to California . " " Oh , no . " " Ah , Jesus , " he said . " Can ye picture it , man ? The poor woman herself opens the crate and out leaps this wee savage with an evil glint in his good eye . " " Oh , Fluffy , ' " I said , pitching my voice as high as it would go , " what have they done to you ? ' " " Ach , Fluffy , I hardly knew ye ! ' " " Was it a hard trip , Fluffy ? ' " " Can you see it , man ? Oh , you should have heard Dennis tell it . He told it much better than I ever could . " His face darkened , and he took a long drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " and the damned fool went . I 'd have got him out of it . I told him I 'd get him out of it , there was nothing easier , all I had to do was make a telephone call . " " He would n't let you ? " " I want to go , says he . I want to serve my country , say 's he . Dennis says I let someone go . Let the fucking niggers serve A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 199  | their fucking country . They 've got more to gain and less to lose than yourself . But he would n't hear of it . And off he went , and he died there , and they shipped him home in a body bag . Sweet Jesus , what a fucking waste . " " Why do you suppose he went , Mick ? " " Ah , who can say ? He was home on leave before they shipped him overseas . I told him if he wanted to get out now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t would be easy enough to get him out of the country . He could go to Canada , or to Ireland . Mickey , says he , what would I do in Canada ? What would I do in Ireland ? What did I ever do here ? And he gave me this sweet smile , a smile to break your heart . And I knew he was going to die over there , and I knew that he knew it . " I thought for a moment . I said , " You think that 's why he went ? " " I do . " " I have a rendezvous with death , ' " I said , and quoted the few lines I remembered of the Alan Seeger poem . " That 's it exactly , " he said . " A rendezvous with death . He had a date and would not break it , the poor lad . " A little before two , Burke shut down the taps and sent the handful of customers on their way , all but the little old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stool while Burke placed the chairs on top of the tables so they 'd be out of the way when the floor was mopped first thing in the morning . When he was through he brought over Mick 's bottle and a thermos of coffee , setting them within reach on the next table . He said , " I 'm off , Mick . " " Good man . " " Mr. Dougherty 's still sittin ' there . I 'll walk out with him , shall I ? " " Ask him if he 'd rather stay until the rain lets up . He 's no trouble . Just lock up , and I 'll let him out when he 's ready . " But the old fellow did n't want to stay past closing . He followed Burke to the door and they went out together . Mick turned out all the lights but the one over our table , came back and freshened his drink . ' Mat was Eamonn Dougherty , " he said . " He never set foot in here , and then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue . The building 's scheduled for demolition , or  | maybe they 've already taken it down . I have n't been over there to see . Dougherty went every day to the Galway Rose , and now he 's here every day . He 'll sit for eight hours and drink two pints of beer and never say a word . " " I do n't believe I know him . " " Why should you ? He was killing men fifteen years before you were born . " " Are you serious ? " " We talked of West Cork , " he said , " and Paddy Meehan 's pub and its improvements . Eamonn Dougherty is from Skibbereen in West Cork . During the Troubles he was with Tom Barry 's flying column . " He sang : " Oh , but is n't it great to see / The Auxies and the RIC / The Black and Tans turn tail and flee / Away from Barry 's coll-yum . ' Do you know that song ? " " I do n't even know what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the RIC was the Royal Irish Constabulary , and you know who the Black and Tans were . Here 's a song you 'd understand without a glossary . On the eighteenth day of November Outside of the town of Macroom The Tans in their great Crossley tender Came hurryin ' on to their doom But the boys of the coll-yum were waiting With rifle and powder and shot And the Irish Republican Army Made shit of the whole fuckin ' lot . " It was a bloody massacre , and trust the fucking Irish to write a song about it . Eamonn Dougherty was in the middle of it . Oh , he did his share of killing , that one . The British had a price on his head , and then the Free State government put a price on his head , and he came here . A relative got him a job unloading trucks in a warehouse , though you would n't think he had the size for it . Then he was a taxi dispatcher for many years , and he 's long since re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and says not a word , and God alone knows what goes on in his head . " " When you first started talking about him , " I said , " I found myself thinking of another little old man . I lis name was I I ( mier ' h:unnnvv . " A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 201  | " I do n't know him . " " I never knew him myself , " I said , " but he started something . Or continued something , it 's hard to know for sure . It makes a hell of a story . " " Ah , " he said . " Let 's hear it . "  | And so I told the story of the club of thirty-one . I talked for a long time . When I was done Mick did n't say anything at first . He filled his glass and held it to the light . " I remember Cunningham 's , " he said . " They served good beet and the bar would pour you a decent drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , all the people who are gone . I do n't understand time . I do n't understand it at all . " " No . " " Sand through an hourglass . You hold something  --  anything for a moment in your hand . And then it 's gone . " He sighed . " When did they have their first meeting ? Thirty years ago ? " " Thirty-two . " " I was twenty-five , and a loutish piece of work I was . They 'd never have had me in their club , or any other decent association of men . But that 's a club I 'd have joined if asked . " " So would I. " " And never missed a meeting , " he said . " Standing together . Bearing witness . Waiting for the man with the broad ax . " " The man with ? ? " " Death , " he said . " That 's how I envision him . A man with his arms and shoulders hare , wearing a black hood and carrying a A LONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were put to death in a past life , and the man you just described was the executioner . " " And who 's to say she 's wrong ? " He shook his big head . " Sand through an hourglass . Eamonn Dougherty , the fucking Scourge of Skibbereen , sitting on his barstool watching the years slip past him . He outlived the Galway Rose , the murderous little bastard . He 'll outlive us all , with his wee cap and his two pints of beer . " He drank . " A long line of dead men , " he said . " How 's that ? " " Ah , it 's a story . Do you know Barney O'Day ? He used to come to Morrissey 's . " " I never met him there , " I said , " but I knew him when I was at the Sixth . He managed a bar on West Thirteenth Street . They had live music , and sometimes he 'd get up and sing a song . " " Had he any sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was any worse than the paid entertainment . I used to run into him at the Lion 's Head , too . What about him ? " " Well , it 's a story I heard another man tell at a wake , " he said . " It seems Barney 's old mother was in hospital , and he was at her bedside , and the dear told him that she was ready to die . I had a good life , says she , and wrung all the joy I could out of it , and I 'm not after havin ' machines keepin ' me alive , an ' tubes stickin ' out of me . So give us a kiss , Barney me lad , says she , as you were always as foine a son as a mother could ask for , an ' then tell the doctor to pull the plug an ' let me go . " So your man gives her a kiss and goes off to find the doctor , and tells him straight out what the old woman wants him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy himself . He has n't been at it long , and Barney can see he 's got no stomach for this sort of thing . He wants to be prolonging life , not cutting it short . He 's troubled , and Barney 's a gentle soul himself , for all the bluster he puts on , and wants to spare the man some agony . " ' Doctor , ' says he , put your mind at ease . It 's not such a terrible thing you have to be doin ' . Doctor , let me tell you somethin ' . We O'Days come from a long line of dead people . ' " Outside , the wind blew up and drove rain against the windows . I looked out and saw cars passing , their lights reflected in the wet pavement . " That 's a wonderful story , " I said . " Ever since it was told to me , " he said , " I 've carried the line  | around with me . For do n't we all come from a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your tale of the club put me in mind of it . Thirty-one men , and one by one they go to their graves , and the last man left starts it all over again . A long line of dead men , stretching back through the centuries . " " All the way to Babylon , rumor has it . " " All the way to Adam , " he said . " All the way to the first fish that grew hands and hauled himself ashore . Is some bastard killing these men of yours ? " " It looks that way . " " Can you tell who it is ? " " No , " I said , " I ca n't . It 's one of them or it 's not , and either way it makes no sense that I can see .

" And , a little while later , he said , " They 've a memorial in Washington , a wall with the names of all who died over there . You 've seen it ? " " Only in photos . " " I thought , What the hell do I want to go there for ? I know what it looks like . I know his name . I could print it out if I cared to , and hang it on a wall of my own . But something made me go . I ca n't explain it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taxi from the station and told the driver I wanted to see the Vietnam Memorial . It was n't tar at all . It 's just a wall , you know , with a simple shape to it . But you A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 205  | said you 've seen photographs , so you know what it looks like . " I looked at it and I started reading the names . A long line of dead men . ' That was a long line of dead men . Thousands of names in no particular order , and only one name among them that meant a thing to me , so why was I reading the others ? And how would I ever find his in the midst of them ? " I overheard someone telling someone else where to go to locate a name , and I stopped reading the names and went over to the directory and found out where his name was . I was afraid they might have left it off , but no , it was there , all right . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dennis Edward Ballou . " I looked at that name , " he said , " and my throat closed up , and I felt an awful fullness in the center of my chest , as if I 'd taken a blow there . The letters of his name blurred in front of me , and I had to blink to clear my vision , and I thought I might weep . I have n't done that since I was a boy . I 'd taught myself not to weep when my father hit me , and it was a lesson I learned too well . I 'd have been glad of a few tears that day , but I 'm long past them . They 've dried up within me , they 've gone and turned to dust . " But I could not get away from that great fucking monument . I read his name again and again , and then I read the name before his and the one after , and then I walked along and read more names . I was there for hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to tell you . And from time to time I would go back and find his name again , and look at it . " I 'd thought I would stay the night , see something of the city . I 'd booked a room at a hotel across the street from the White House . But I was at the wall until the sun went down , and then I walked until I came to a bar , and I went in and had a drink . Then I went to another bar , and another , and then I bought a bottle and took a taxi back to Union Station . " I took the first train out , and I left the bottle unopened until the %top at Wilmington , Delaware . Then I broke the seal and had a drink , and by the time we were back in New York the bottle was empty . And I might have been drinking well water for all the effect It had on me . I caught a cab at Penn Station and came right here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phone call from a friend of ours in the Bronx . A fellow we needed to find had been seen going into a certain house off Gun Hill Road .  | " So Andy drove , and we went up to Gun Hill Road and found this fellow . And I beat him to death with my hands . " " Tell me , " he said . " What was your father like ? " " I 'm not sure I know . He was dead before I was grown . " " Was he a cop himself ? " " Oh , God , no . " " I thought perhaps it was a family thing . " " Not at all . He did , oh , different things . " " Did he drink ? " " That was one of the things he did , " I said . " He mostly worked for other people , but a couple of times he was in business for himself . The one I remember best was a shoe store . That was up in the Bronx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs of the store . " " And he sold shoes . " " Children 's shoes , mostly . And work shoes , those steel-toed boots they wear on construction sites . It was a neighborhood store and people would bring their kids in once a year for new shoes , and there was an X-ray machine you stood at and you could see the bones of your feet and tell if you needed new shoes yet . " " Could n't you just pinch the shoes and see where the toes reached to ? " " I guess you could , and I guess that 's why you do n't see those machines anymore , but they were the latest thing when he had the store . I wonder what all those X rays did to your feet . Nobody worried about them at the time , but nobody worried about asbestos then , either . " " If you live long enough , " he said , " you find out there 's nothing on earth that 's good for you . What became of the store ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold it . One day we had to move , and that was the last I saw of the store . I went looking for it years later and the whole street was gone , bulldozed and paved over when they widened the Cross-Bronx Expressway . " " Is that where you grew up ? The Bronx ? " " We moved around a lot , " I said . " The Bronx , Upper Manhattan , Queens . My grandparents on my mother 's side lived in the East New York section of Brooklyn , and a couple of times my parents separated and we wound up living with them . ' then they 'd urt hack together again and we 'd start over in a new apartment A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 207  | " How old were you when he died ? " " Fourteen . " I 'd switched some time ago from coffee to Perrier , and I picked up my glass and took a good look at the little bubbles . " He was riding the subway , " I said , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it the L now , they took one of its letters away . I suppose it 's an economy move . " He was riding between two cars . He 'd gone there so he could smoke , and he fell , and the wheels tore him up . " " Ah , Jesus . " " It must have been quick , " I said , " and he would almost have had to be drunk , do n't you think ? Who but a drunk would think it was a good idea to ride between the cars like that ? " " What did he drink ? " " My dad ? Whiskey . He might have a beer with his meals , but if he was going to drink it was whiskey , whiskey and soda . Blended stuff . Three Feathers , Four Roses . Carstair 's . I do n't even know if those brands still exist , but that 's what he drank . " " Mine drank wine . " " I never saw wine in the house . For all I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life . " " Mine bought it by the gallon . He bought it from a man who made it , another Frenchman . And he drank marc . Have you ever had that ? " " I 'm not even sure I know what it is . Some kind of brandy ? " He nodded . " After you 've made wine , you make a brandy from the spent grapes . The Italians make much the same thing and call it grappa . By either name it 's the nastiest thing you could ever have the misfortune to drink . I had some in France , in the town where he was born , and it was all I could do to swallow it and keep it down . It was still another French immigrant he got it from . There were a lot of the French in this part of the city , you know . They worked in the hotels and restaurants , many of them , and some like my father worked in the meat market . " He took a drink . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink was on him ? " " Jesus , no . He was the gentlest man who ever lived . " " Was he then . " " I k was a quiet man , " I said , " and he was sad . I suppose you could say he was despairing . When he drank he would get happy . Hr would sing songs and , I do n't know , just be silly . Then he  | But I never saw him get angry and I certainly never knew him to hit anyone . " " Mine was quiet , too . The bastard never said a word . " He filled his glass . " His English was n't good and he had a thick accent . You were hard put to understand the man . But he spoke so rarely it scarcely mattered . He was free with his hands , though . " " He hit you ? " " He hit all of us . Not her , for I believe he was terrified of her . Like an elephant afraid of a mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip of a woman . But she could do more damage with her tongue than he ever did with his fists . " He tilted his head and looked up at the stamped-tin ceiling . " I got my size from him , " he said , " and I got it early . He would beat me without a word and I took his beatings without a word , and then one day when I was not quite sixteen it was a time too many , and I did n't even flinch when he slapped me but stood my ground and hit him with my closed fist , hit him right in the mouth . He stood wide-eyed at the wonder of it and I hit him again and knocked him down , and I picked up a wooden chair and held it over my head , and I was going to hit him with it , and I might have killed him that way .

I put the chair down and took his hand and drew him to his feet , and he clapped me on the back and walked off without a word . And never hit me again . " A year later I was living in a place of my own , collecting on the waterfront for a couple of Italians and stealing whatever I could . And a year after that he was dead . " " How did he die ?

" " I do n't think so , " I said , " although she gave me a turn the other day . I was trying to get hold of the woman whose husband was stabbed to death in Forest Hills in February .

I began to flag sometime around four-thirty or five in the morning , and there was a time when the conversation died down and I glanced over at the window . But it was still pouring , and instead of pleading exhaustion and heading for the door I pushed my Perrier aside and poured one more cup of coffee from the thermos . A little later I caught a second wind , and it carried me past dawn and down to St. Bernard 's for the butchers ' mass . There were fifteen or twenty of us in the little side chapel , including seven or eight men from the meat market , dressed in white aprons just like Mick 's , some of them stained as his was stained . There were several nuns as well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . And a few elderly people , men and women , including one who was a dead ringer for the murderous Eamonn Dougherty , right down to the cloth cap . We left when the mass was over , without having taken Communion . The sky was still overcast but no rain was falling . Mick 's A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 211  | Cadillac was where he 'd parked it , in the reserved space in front of Twomey 's funeral parlor . Twomey was out in front and gave us a wave when he saw us . Mick gave him a smile and a nod . " It 's good days for Twomey , " he said . " His business is more than twice what it was , now that they 're dying of AIDS all around him . It 's an ill wind , eh ? " " That 's the truth . " " I 'll tell you another , " he said . " Every wind 's an ill wind . " He dropped me at my door . I went upstairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , not wanting to wake Elaine if she was still sleeping . When I opened the door she was standing there , wearing a robe I 'd bought for her . The look on her face told me right away that something was wrong . Before I could ask , she said , " You do n't know , do you ? You have n't heard ? " " Heard what ? " She put a hand out , took mine . " Gerard Billings was killed last night , " she said .  | For a full twelve years , Gerard Billings had been the weather reporter for an independent New York broadcast channel . While he was officially known as the chief meteorologist , his function was primarily reportorial . His colorful clothing , his irrepressible personality , and his evident willingness to make a fool of himself on camera were more important factors in his rise than his ability to read a weather map . He was on the air twice a day , at 6:55 P.m. , just before the close of the 6:30 news program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the late news and before the extended sports summary . Typi tally , he would arrive at the station at five in the afternoon , work out what he was going to say and get his maps and charts in order , and go out for dinner after the broadcast . Sometimes he would linger over dinner for a couple of hours , then return to the studio . Other nights he 'd go home for a nap and a change of clothes , then go back to the studio for his second stint of the day . He 'd get there between 10 and 10:30 ; he did n't need as much time to prepare , because he would be using the same charts and giving essentially the same report . At seven that Tuesday night he went straight home to the apartment on West Ninety-sixth where he 'd lived sink his divorce four years previously . He ordered Chinese food from a restaurant on A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 213  | Amsterdam Avenue . Shortly after ten he went downstairs and caught a cab driven by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited to make a left turn into Columbus Avenue , it was sideswiped by a car that was attempting to pass it on the right . The driver leaped from his car and got into a loud argument with Rakhman Ali , at the climax of which he drew a handgun , shot Ali three times in the face and upper chest , then yanked open the door of the cab and emptied his gun into Ali 's passenger . He then sped away in his own vehicle , which was variously described as anywhere from two to twelve years old . Witnesses seemed to agree that it was a four-door sedan , that it was dark in color , and that it had seen better days . Elaine , watching the news , knew something was wrong even before they introduced a substitute weatherman to fill in for Billings . There were no jokes about the absent forecaster being under the weather , and all of the reporters in the studio seemed to be keeping a grim secret . It turned out that they had learned of Bill-ings 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the story pending notification of kin . This decision was overruled toward the end of the broadcast when they realized they were in danger of getting scooped by their competitors ; accordingly , the anchorwoman made the unfortunate announcement right after the sports wrap-up . " I did n't know what to do , " Elaine said . " I knew you were at ( ; rogan 's and I looked up the number and thought about calling , hut what were you going to do in the middle of a rainy night ? Besides , for all I knew it was just what it looked like , an argument over a traffic accident that got out of control . It happens all the time , and everybody 's got a gun these days , and maybe they 'd catch the poor loser who did it within the hour , and why ruin your evening with Mick over that ? " So instead I turned the radio to WINS and stayed up for hours . I had the radio turned down low and I had a book to read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over , and when they got to the Billings story I would stop reading and turn the volume up , and it would he the same thing as before , word for word . And I wound up falling asleep with the radio on and woke up at seven with it blaring away . " Should I have called you ? I did n't know what to do . "  | It was just as well she had n't called me . There would n't have been anything for me to do . There was little enough for me to do now , the morning after the shooting , except field the telephone calls that came in from Ray Gruliow and Lewis Hildebrand and Gordon Walser . I 'd have to know more , I told each of them , before I 'd know how to proceed . By early afternoon they 'd found the car , a 1988 Ford Crown Victoria with Jersey plates , registered to an opthalmologist in Teaneck . The vehicle had been located in the pound where it had been towed from a no-parking zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of a partial plate number supplied by a witness , and confirmed by paint scrapings on the car and on Rakhman Ali 's yellow cab . The ophthalmologist 's wife told police that her husband was in Houston attending a professional conference ; he 'd flown there Friday from Newark , after having left his car in the long-term parking lot . There were fingerprints on the steering wheel and the dash , but they turned out to be those of the traffic officer who 'd opened the car door and put it in neutral so that it could be towed . There were no prints that could have belonged to the shooter , whom witnesses described as of average height and wearing a baseball cap and a glossy dark blue warm-up jacket with a name embroidered over the breast pocket . None of the witnesses had been close enough to read the name . The incident looked ordinary enough , newsworthy in that one of the two victims had enjoyed a measure of local celebrity . Someone had stolen a car from an airport parking lot , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crime . Maybe he was chemically impaired at the time of the accident . Maybe he was just having a bad day . In any event , he 'd reacted badly to an ordinary fender-bender . Instead of exchanging licenses and insurance cards , he 'd pulled a gun and started blasting . It could have happened that way . Or he could have parked his stolen car where he could keep an eye on the entrance to Billings 's building , could have tagged along after the cab that stopped for Billings , could have engineered the collision and its aftermath . Nothing to it . I was up all day , drinking too much coffee , and fighting off I was un all day , drinking too much coffee and fighting off A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 215  | regular meeting , but I could n't make myself pay attention , nor could I keep from leaving at the break . When I walked in the door , Elaine told me to take a hot bath and go to bed . " Just do it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tension , and when I got into bed I fell asleep almost immediately . I must have dreamed about Jim Shorter , because I woke up concerned about him . I said as much to Elaine , and she told me he 'd called the night before , while I was at St. Paul 's . " He said it was n't important , " she said , " and not to call him because he was on his way out . So I did n't mention it . " I called him . No answer . I listened to the news and there was nothing about Billings . I went out and bought the Times and all three tabloids and read four versions of the same story . The Times article jumped from the front page to the obituary page , where his obituary included a photo and six inches of text . I read the obit , and the half-dozen others . And then I went on to read the half-page of paid death notices . Fully a third of these were for a man who had died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide range of charitable endeavors ; each was now taking pains to reward him with a paid announcement of their sorrow at his passing . I raced through those , but read the others fairly closely , as is my custom these days . My attention slacked off some toward the end , as it generally does . Once I 've made it past the S 's without finding my own name , my appetite for the pursuit is a little less keen . But I stayed there right through the alphabet , and thus learned of the death on Monday of Helen Stromberg Watson , wife of the late Alan Watson , of Forest Hills . It took a few calls before I found a cop who would talk to me . " Accidental drowning , " he said . " Coulda slipped , hit her head on the tile . Drowned right in her own bathtub . All you got ta do is lose consciousness long enough to fill the lungs with water . Happens all the time . " " Oh , really ? " " Ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , see , there 's a possibility of suicide . Woman lost her husband earlier this year , despondent over the loss , so on and so on . We found a bottle  | out , you want to call that suicide ? I do n't , not without a note , not when you got the children 's feelings to consider , losing both parents in less'n six months . ' Sides , who knows what 's in somebody else 's mind ? You have a few drinks , and before you know it you pass out and you drown . Or the drinks hit you hard , especially in a hot tub , and you lose your balance and smack your head and that 's what knocks you out . Hey , accidents happen . " " And she died on Monday ? " " That 's when they found her . Doc 's guess was she was in the water three days by then . " No wonder she had n't answered the phone . " You know what the weather 's been like , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body 's like after a couple of days in the water . Put ' em both together , do I have to tell you what they spell ? " " Who discovered the body ? " " A neighbor . One of her kids called next door , concerned because he could n't reach his mother on the phone . The neighbor had a key and let herself in . Hell of a thing to walk in on . " I called Jim Shorter . No answer . I called Elaine at the shop . I said , " When Shorter called last night did he seem nervous ? Did he sound as though he was afraid ? " " No , why ? " " Alan Watson 's widow drowned in her bathtub sometime over the weekend . The time of death 's hard to pinpoint , but it evidently happened after I went out to Corona and talked to the head of that security firm . " " I 'm not sure I see the connection . " " There has to be one , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He must be afraid somebody saw something , or knows something . He killed the widow , and the next logical step is the person who was first on the scene , the guard who discovered Watson 's body . " " Jim Shorter ? " " His phone does n't answer . " " He could be anywhere , " she said . " Maybe he 's at a meeting . " " Or in a bar , " I said . " Or in his room with a bottle , not picking up the phone . " " Or having breakfast , or catching the Rothko retrospective at the Whitnev. which would he my first choice if I did n't have a A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 217  | " Look for him . There 's something he knows , even if he does n't know he knows it . I want to find him before it gets him killed . " " Hold on a second , " she said . She covered the mouthpiece for a moment , then came back and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want company . " By the time I got dressed and downstairs , he was waiting for me in front of the building . He was wearing his preppy clothes , the effect slightly compromised by the black Raiders cap . " We can lose the cap , " he said , " if I 's got to look straighter than straight , Nate . " " I did n't say anything about the cap . " " Guess I hearin ' things . " " Or reading minds . " I stepped to the curb , hailed a cab , told the driver Eighty-second and Second . " Anyway , " I went on , " I do n't think it matters what anybody wears . We 're just wasting our time . " " You do n't expect nothing . " " That 's right . " " Just brung me along so 's you 'd have company . " " More or less . " He rolled his eyes . " Then what we doin ' in a cab , Tab ? Man like you take a taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , " I said , " let 's hope you 're wrong . " I had him wait in the cab while I climbed a flight of stairs and checked the meeting room at the Eighty-second Street Workshop . That was where I 'd brought Jim Friday night , and he 'd mentioned going to other meetings there since . There was a meeting going on , and I went in and found a good vantage point beside the coffee urn . When I was sure he was n't there I went downstairs and got hack in the cab . I had the driver go up First Avenue and drop us at the corner of Ninety-fourth . Our first stop was the Blue Canoe , and if Shorter did n't get drunk and did n't get killed , someday the place might figure in his qualification . " I met this guy there , " he could say , " figuring I could con him into buying me a couple of beers , and the next thing I knew I was at an AA meeting . And here I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was n't at the Blue Canoe now , or at any of the other bars or luncheonettes on First Avenue . 1 and I made the rounds together . It would have been convenient if we could have shared the work ,  | When we 'd finished with a four-block stretch of First Avenue , we walked west on Ninety-fourth to Shorter 's rooming house . I 'd have rung his bell if I knew which one it was . Instead I rang the bell marked SUPER . When it went unanswered we left and walked to Second Avenue , where we wasted some more time checking more bars and restaurants , from Ninety-second to Ninety-sixth and back to where we 'd started . I found a phone that worked and called Shorter 's number and it did n't answer . I was starting to get a bad feeling . There was no point combing the city for him , I thought , because we were n't going to find him that way . And there was no point dialing his number because he was n't going to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , TJ tagging along beside me . I rang the super 's bell , and when there was no answer I poked other buttons at random so that someone could buzz me in . No one did , but after a few minutes a very large woman emerged from one of the first-floor rooms and waddled to the door . She frowned through the glass panel at us , and without opening the door she asked what we wanted . I said we wanted the super . " You 're wasting your time , " she said . " He ai n't got no vacan-cies . " " Where is he ? " " This is a respectable house . " God knows who she thought we were . I took out a business card from Reliable and held it against the glass . She squinted at it and moved her lips as she read it . When she was done her lips settled into a tight narrow line . " That 's hint on the stoop across the street , " she said grudgingly . " His name 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd pointed to , two of them playing checkers , the third kibitzing their game . The kibitzer was drinking a can of Miller 's . The players were sharing a carton of Tropicana orange juice . I said , " Carlos ? " and they all looked at me . I held out my card and one of the players took it . He was stocky , with a flattened nose and liquid brown eyes , and I decided he must be Carlos . " I 'm concerned about one of your tenants , " I said . " I 'm afraid he may have had an accident . " " Who 's that ? " " lames Shorter . " A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 219  | " Shorter . " " Late forties , medium height , dark hair ? " " I know him , " he said .

" " I do n't know which bell is his . " " Do n't it got his name on it ? " " No . " He sighed . " A lot of them , " he said , " they do n't want no name on the bell . I put the name in , they just take it out . Then their friends come , ring the wrong bell , disturb everybody . Or they ring my bell . I tell you , it 's a big pain in the ass . " " Well , " I said . He got to his feet . " First thing we do , " he said , " is we ring his hell . Then we see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went inside and climbed three flights of stairs , and the house was about what I 'd expected , with a Lysol smell battling the odors of cooking and mice and urine . Carlos led us to what he said was Shorter 's door and banged on it with a heavy fist . " Hey , open up , " he called . " ' Phis gen'man wants to talk to you . " Nothing . " Not home , " Carlos said , and shrugged . " You want to write him a note , put it under the door , an ' when he comes home ? " " I think you should open the door , " I said . " I do n't know about that . " " I 'm worried about him , " I said . " I think he might have had an accident . " " What kind of accident ? " " A had one . Open the door .

" " What 's worse'n sick ? " I guess it came to him , because he winced at the thought . " Shit , I hope not . " He hauled out a ring of keys , found his master passkey , and fitted it in the lock . " Anyway , " he said , " you would n't have to kick it in , less'n he got the chain on . These locks is nothin ' , you can slip ' em with a plastic card . But if the chain 's on , shit , you still gon na have to kick it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the lock , paused to knock on the door one final unnecessary time , and pushed the door inward . The room was empty . He stood in the doorway . I pushed past him , walked around the little room . It was as neat and bare as a monk 's cell . There was an iron bedstead , a chest of drawers , a bedside table . The bed was made . The drawers were empty . So was the closet . I looked under the bed . There were no personal articles anywhere , just the thrift-shop furniture that had been there when he moved in . " I guess he moved out , " Carlos said . The telephone was on the beside table . I slipped a pencil under the receiver and lifted it enough to get a dial tone , then allowed it to drop back in place . " He did n't say nothin ' to nobody , " Carlos said . " He pays a week at a time , so he 's paid through Sunday . Funny , huh ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow . There was a booklet under it . He took a close look at it and handed it to me .

I got to change it anyway before I rent it to somebody else , do n't I ? " " Let 's hope so . " " Course I do . " He frowned , puzzled . " Maybe he 's comin ' back .

"  | Martin Banszak took off his rimless glasses and fogged the lenses with his breath , then polished each in turn with his handkerchief .

" You must know the caliber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guard work pays just one or two dollars an hour over the minimum wage . It 's a job that requires no experience and minimal training .

Those were n't offenses you could smell on a man 's breath , or spot in his walk , " Let 's get hack to Shorter , " I said . A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 223  | Shorter 's file contained the application he 'd filled out , along with a record of the hours he 'd worked and the compensation he 'd received .

Had Shorter actually been working there for seven months by the time Alan Watson was killed ? " Yes , and he was very steady , very reliable , " he said . " That 's why I was inclined to give him a break when he had the first incident . " " The drinking . " " Yes . I k must have been ashamed , because he did n't even offer an argument in his own defense , just hung his head waiting to he fired .

" Is there a place in the neighborhood where I can get it copied ? " He said he had a desktop copier and would run it for me . He went into another room , came back with the copy but held on to it for a moment . He said , " I 'm not sure I understand . If Shorter knows something , if he 's disappeared in order to escape from the man who killed Watson " ? that was the explanation I 'd devised for him ?

He 'd carried a New York State driver 's license , and its number was listed on his job application . But the DMV never heard of him , and the license number he 'd written down was unassigned .

It would have made my life easier if Banszak had fingerprinted his employees , even if he 'd done nothing with the prints but file them away . Earlier , I 'd left TJ on guard at the rooming house and cabbed down to the Flatiron Building and back , borrowing a fingerprint kit from Wally Donn at Reliable . Before I left Shorter 's room I had fogged the telephone receiver with my breath the way Banszak had fogged his glasses .

" One time I was talking to him and he asked me if I 'd reached Helen Watson yet . How did he know her first name ? He never heard it from me . Jesus , how long was he stalking them ?

He 'd been stalking Alan Watson for a minimum of seven months , from the time he 'd started work with Queensboro-Corona to the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodity broker 's heart . God knows how many opportunities he must have had in all that time , but he 'd been in no hurry , he 'd been content to bide his time , waiting , letting the anticipation build . Then , when he finally struck , he 'd allowed himself the extra satisfaction of discovering the body and phoning it in to the police , like a firebug coming back to watch the firemen battle the blaze he 'd set . And then , remarkably , he 'd stayed on the job another six weeks before he could contrive to get fired . So I knew that he liked to take his time , and I knew , too , that he could strike quickly if he wanted to . I 'd seen him on Friday night , and a day later Watson 's widow was dead .

He listed his place of birth as Klamath Falls , Oregon , but they never heard of anybody by that name , and there 's no reason to assume he 's ever been within a thousand miles of the place . He moved into his rooming house a week before he turned up on their doorstep at QueensboroCorona , and it 's my guess that James Shorter was born right about that time . I think he slapped together some fake ID , rented himself a room by the week , and went out to look for a job . " " So that he could stalk Alan . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he 's a stalker .

A hundred ? But he kept putting it off , and not because he was afraid of getting caught . " " He was holding back to boost his excitement . " " Exactly . " " But with Gerry ? " " I think he started stalking somebody else very shortly after he killed Watson . Probably Billings , but it could have been anybody . Maybe he was keeping tabs on a couple of you .

" " Ile nicked a pretty dramatic way to kill Gerry . " A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 227  | " He would have known where he lived , and his usual schedule . I suppose he had a gun , or knew where to get one . It could n't have been too hard for him to take a bus to Newark Airport and drive back in a stolen car . Then all he had to do was wait for Billings and pick his opportunity . Engineering a car crash was a nice touch , but he had other options . He could have staged a drive-by shooting , he could have tried running Billings down . " Or he could have found a way to toss a bomb through Gruliow 's high-tech plastic window . That way he could have taken out nine of the fourteen remaining members at once . He 'd known about the meeting , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd pumped me a little I 'd even said it was in the Village . Gruliow was the only member who lived in the Village . Maybe Shorter had been around Commerce Street Tuesday afternoon , maybe he 'd been across the street at the Grange , nursing a beer and watching them file in . Watching me , too . I said , " Who the hell is he ? Do you have any idea ? " " None . " " We know he 's not a member , but I do n't think any of us seriously thought it could be . Who else knows about the club ? " " No one , really . Not in any detail . " " He 's forty-eight . In 1961 he would have been what , sixteen ? Could he have been somebody 's younger brother , transferring a resentment against a sibling to the entire club ? " " God , that strikes me as far-fetched . " " I do n't know that we can expect to find a logical motive , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a longstanding pattern of insane behavior ? All he needed was a pretext . " " Would n't it have to be a good one to sustain him this long ? " " No , " I said . " All it had to do was get him started . Once he was in motion his own momentum would sustain him , no matter how trail the original impetus . " " Because he enjoys what he 's doing . " " Ile loves it , " I said , " but I have a feeling it 's more than that . It 's his whole life . " I had abbreviated versions of that conversation with as many of the other members as I could get hold of . I described Shorter and asked them if the description seemed to fit anybody who might k nvn flit 11,4,1 nn o rnu.runrnnr ? urunee th .. ur .. u .1 ? l II  | said essentially the same thing  --  the description fit too many people , and they could n't think of anyone , of any description , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group . Or even to know it existed . " It 's a shame there 's no photograph , " more than one of them said . And I explained how his employers in Corona had taken a pair of Polaroids , but nobody could furnish a copy . One was on his ID , which he 'd very likely retained ; the other had conveniently disappeared from his file . And when , I wondered , had that happened ? Had he been resourceful enough to slip off with the photo before they let him go ? Or had he paid an unauthorized visit sometime over the weekend to tidy up after himself ? He could have combined it with the trip to Forest Hills to drown Helen Watson in her tub . " Would n't he have had other pictures taken ? " Elaine wondered . " How did he cash his paychecks ? I ca n't believe he had a bank account . " " He used a check-cashing service . But he had his QueensboroCorona ID and his driver 's license . He would n't need anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him . " " And took him to a meeting . " " And you do n't get mugged and printed at AA meetings , do you ? I guess it would be a violation of the tradition of anonymity , would n't it ? " " I 'm afraid so . " " If I 'd been along , " she said , " I could have taken a sneak photo of him , the way we did at Wallbanger 's . Remember ? " " Oh , for Christ 's sake , " I said . " What 's the matter ? Did I say something wrong ? " " No , " I said . " You said something right . I do n't know what the hell 's the matter with me , I really do n't . Why ca n't l think straight ? " " What do you mean ?

" This is a piece of cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your mind and how long did it take to get it out of your head and onto a piece of paper ? Fifteen , twenty minutes ? " " Something like that .

I had one a week ago , over and over she 's telling me I got the eyes wrong . How are they wrong ? Too big , too small , too far apart , too close together , what ? Are they slanted ? Are they almond-shaped ? Droopy eyelids ? Tell me something , because just saying they 're wrong do n't cut it . I try this , I try that , I change this , I fix that , all I get is the eyes are wrong . You know what it turns out ? " " What ? " " She never saw his fuckin ' eyes .

" I could n't get past the fact that I did n't have a photograph of him  | I was sitting in the same room with one of your sketches and I still did n't get the message . " " Sometimes it 's hard to see what 's right in front of you . " " I guess . " When I went to pay him he did n't want to take the money .

They want me to use a computer to do what I do . " " You mean like an Identi-Kit ? " " No , this is different , " he said . " Much more flexible than the Identi-Kit . You can make minute adjustments to the shape of the mouth , elongate the head , set the eyes deeper , anything you could do with pencil and paper . " He explained how the software worked and what it would do . " But it 's not drawing , " he said . " It 's not art . " He laughed , and I asked him what was funny . " Just hearing myself use the word , " he said . " I would always correct Elaine when she called it art , what I do . I 'm beginning to think she 's right .

And we keep on , and now and then we have to stop because she 's crying , or she ca n't look at the paper anymore , or she 's just wiped out . Believe me , time we 're done , we 're both wiped out . " " And you wound up with a human face ? " " I wound up with a human face , " he said , " but whose face ? Does it look like the man who went to the gas chamber ? No way to know . It brought back memories , I know that much , and she 's got a picture that means something to her , so what 's the difference ? Is it as good as a photograph ? Well , maybe it 's better . Is it art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think so . " " And this ? " " This prick ? " He leaned forward , blew some eraser dust from the surface of the sketch . " This does n't have to be art . Just so it looks like him . " I went to a copy shop , ran two dozen copies of the sketch . It seemed to me it was a good likeness . I gave the original to Elaine but told her not to hang it anywhere for the time being . I left a copy with TJ , who raised an eyebrow and announced that Shorter was an ugly-looking dude . Over the next few days , I got around to most of the men who 'd been at the meeting at Gruliow 's house , as well as a few who had n't been able to make it . No one echoed TJ 's sentiment , but neither did anyone recognize Shorter as a long-lost cousin . " He 's a pretty ordinary-looking guy , " Bob Berk told me . " Not a face that would jump out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked vaguely familiar . Lewis Hildebrand told me he might have seen Shorter before , that it was impossible to say . " The visual onslaught in this city is overpow-ering , " he said . " Walk a few blocks through midtown Manhattan and more people will pass through your field of vision than the average small-town resident will see all year . Walk through Grand Central Station at rush hour and you 'll see thousands of people without really seeing any of them . How much of it do we screen out ? How much registers , consciously or otherwise ? " In his living room on Commerce Street , Hard-Way Ray Gruliow squinted at the sketch and shook his head . " He looks familiar , " he said . " But in a very vague way . " " That 's what I keep hearing . " " What a crazy thing , huh ? Here 's somebody who hates us all  | enough to devote his entire life to killing us . Because he 's not a guy who got pissed off one morning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life 's work . " " That 's right . " " And we look at him , " he said , " and all we can say is he looks vaguely familiar . Who could he be ? How could he know us ? " " Where could you remember him from ? " " I do n't know . The only time we were all together was once a year at dinner . Maybe he was a waiter at Cunningham 's . What did we decide he was , sixteen years old ? He could n't have been a waiter . Maybe he was a busboy . " " And maybe you stiffed him on the tip . " " No , we would n't do a thing like that . We 're a generous bunch .

" " Plenty , " he said . " Take my word for it . You go out for a meal and what you get is an audition . " " The turnover 's not as high in the old-fashioned steak houses , is it ? " " No , you 're right about that , but how many of them have we got left ? You got Gallagher 's , you got the Old Homestead , you got Keens , you got Peter Luger , you got Smith and Whatsisface , Wullensky , you got ?

" " Unless he had a longing to scoop Rocky Road at a BaskinRobbins . But yeah , you tend to stay with what you know . " " So if you wanted to find somebody who used to work at Cun-ningham 's , those would be the first places to look . " " I suppose . " " But I myself would hardly know how to begin , " I said . " And I 'd have to spend a couple of days running all over the city , trying to convince people to give me the time of day . Whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing by just making a few phone calls .

" " You 'd be saving me time , " I said , " and time is money . I was n't looking to get the information for free . " " Oh , " he said . " Well , that puts a different light on it , does n't it ? " The following day I called Gruliow and told him I 'd found not one but two gentlemen who 'd spent their lives bringing steak dinners to people with hearty appetites . " They were both working at Cunningham 's when it closed , " I said . " One of them started there as a busboy over forty years ago . " " He 'd have been there for our first dinner , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few meetings of the previous chapter . " " He did n't recognize the sketch , though . Neither did the other fellow , who 's actually quite a bit older , although he was only at Cunningham 's from 1967 on . He went from there to the Old I Iomestead , and that 's where he was when he retired three years ago last September . They both said the same thing . " " What 's that ? " " They said he looked familiar . " " Oh , Jesus , " Gruliow said , " You know what our friend 's got ? lie 's got a universally familiar face . Nobody can place it , but everybody thinks he must have seen it somewhere before . You know , Matt , that was lust an offhand remark of mine about his having worked at Cunningham 's "  | " I know . " " Yet you followed it up . " " It was worth checking . " " How on earth did you find those fellows ? " " I did n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find them for me . You know , if I were to hand this over to the cops , they 'd be able to turn up a dozen men who worked at Cunningham 's during the period in question . And one of them might be able to put a name to the face in the sketch . " " I was talking to some of the others , " he said . " And ? " " We all intend to be very cautious . We 'll keep an eye out for the man in the sketch . But we 'd rather not go public with this if we do n't have to . " " If someone else is killed ? " " You said he 'd probably lay low for the next six months . " " That 's what I said , " I agreed , " but what the hell do I know ? I ca n't presume to predict what a madman is going to do next . And so far he has n't shown any inclination to call me up and let me know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night I went to a meeting for the first time all week , and I stopped at the Flame afterward and had a cup of coffee . One of the fellows at the table was a newcomer , and the others were trying to help him , answering his questions and reassuring him that there really was life after sobriety . The new man was in his early thirties and looked nothing like Jim Shorter , but his attitude was very similar to the persona Shorter had adopted for the occasion , mixing guarded hope and cynical skepticism . It made me very uncomfortable to sit at the same table with him . He was n't doing anything wrong , and I knew he was n't putting on an act , but I could n't help feeling as though I was being conned all over again . I went home and told Elaine about it . She said , " You 'd like to kill him , would n't you ? " " The guy tonight ? Oh , you mean Shorter . " " Of course . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't really feel it , but it must he there . I was trying to help him , the cocksucker , and he was just playing me like a fish on a line . The son of a bitch . "  | " Yes , " she said . " I think you might be the slightest bit angry . " She started to say something else but the phone rang and she got up and answered it . " Yes , " she said . " Just one moment , I 'll see if he 's in . " She covered the mouthpiece . " It 's him , " she said .  | " Jim , " I said . " I 'm glad you called . I was hoping I 'd hear from you . " " Well , I 've been busy , Matt . " " Hey , I know what it 's like , " I said .

" " That 's right . How 's it going ? " There was a pause . Then he said , " I know you know , Matt . " " Oh ? " " Funny thing is I thought you knew from the jump . I thought , shit , they finally figured out what 's going on and hired themselves a detective . But you did n't know a thing , did you ? " " No . " " Getting me to come to an AA meeting .

"  | I arranged to meet Felicia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Stafford Avenue ten minutes early , and at 4:20 I was beginning to worry . Fifteen minutes later I was in the vestibule examining the lock on the door leading up to her second-floor flat and wondering how much trouble it would be to let myself in . The possibility of getting nailed for illegal entry scared me less than the thought of what I might find . She lived , after all , just a fifteenminute walk from where Helen Watson had drowned in her bath . I got a flat strip of flexible steel from my wallet and turned to make sure no one was watching me when I took a shot at the door . Across the street , someone was maneuvering a Ford Escort into a tight space . I could have been through the door and up the stairs before the car was parked , but I waited , and Felicia Karp emerged from the car . I put my burglar 's tool away and went to meet her . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " They sprang a meeting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to reach you . " She gave me her canvas tote hag to hold while she unlocked the door . Inside , she led me to the kitchen and heated two cups of the morning 's coffee in the microwave . From the wall , the black cat swung its pendulum tail and rolled its eyes at me . I showed her Ray Galindez 's sketch . She held it at arm 's length and asked who it was supposed to be .  | " Do you recognize him ? " " He looks familiar . Who is he ? " " He worked as a patrol officer for a private security firm . Back in February he discovered the body of Alan Watson while making his rounds a few blocks the other side of Continental Avenue . Watson had been stabbed , and it was n't hard for this man to be the first person on the scene . " " You 're implying that he killed him . " " Yes . " " Was Alan Watson one of the men my husband had dinner with once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this man ? Did he kill my husband ? " " I believe so . " " My God , " she said , and stared at the sketch , and shuddered . " I knew Fred Karp would never kill himself , " she said . " My God . " I said , " You say this man looks familiar . " " I know him . " " Oh ? " " I know I 've seen him . Where did he patrol ? We do n't have private guards around here , although the neighborhood association has been talking about hiring them . You said the other side of Continental Avenue ? I would n't have seen him there . It 's a nice section , upscale compared to this , but I do n't have any reason to go there . Anyway , I know his face , and I would n't know it from glimpsing it through the window of a patrol car . Why do I know his face ? Help me . " " Have you seen him in the neighborhood recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house ? " She shook her head . " Have you seen him at the school ? He could have posed as a parent . " " Why would he do that ? Am I in danger ? " " It 's possible . " " For God 's sake , " she said . She studied the picture . " He looks so damn ordinary , " she said . " To look at him , you 'd think he was too much of a nebbish to be a policeman . " " What could you picture him doing ? " " I do n't know . Something menial , something completely pedes-trian . " " Close your eyes . He 's doing something . What do you sec him doing ? " A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 243  | " What 's this , some new guided-imaging technique ? It 's not going to work .

He wore a uniform , matching pants and a shirt in greenish gray . How would I remember that ? " " I do n't know . " " Sometimes I would meet Fred at his office and we would have dinner and go to a play . And one time I saw this man . I think ? " " Yes ? " " I seem to remember that he was in Fred 's office when I got there , and they were talking . He was sweeping the floor and he was emptying a wastebasket . " " What was his name ? " " How would I know ? " " Your husband might have introduced you . " " I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's very good . " " Nobody introduced him . It was on his shirt . " She traced a short horizontal line above her left breast . " Over the pocket , embroidered in white . No ! Not white , yellow . " She shook her head . " It 's just amazing the things you remember . " " And his name was John . " " Yes . I did n't like him . " " Why not ? " " There was something about him . I thought he was sly . In fact I almost said something to Fred , but I let it go . " " What would you have said ? " " I would have warned him . " " You thought the man was dangerous ? " She shook her head . " Not physically dangerous . I thought he would steal something . There was a furtive quality about him . Do you know what 1 mean ? " " Yes . "  | " But it was n't so pronounced that it stayed in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another thought from that day to this . And I 'm positive I never saw him again . " " If you ever do ? " " Yes , " she said . " I 'll call you immediately , rest assured . " She frowned at the sketch . " Definitely yellow . His name , I mean . John , in yellow script , over the left breast pocket . " The superintendent at the Kashin Building did n't recognize the sketch , and it turned out he had n't been working there at the time of Fred Karp 's death . I went to the management company 's office on West Thirty-seventh Street . Nobody there recognized the sketch , either , but a young woman checked personnel records and came up with an employee named John Siebert . He had started work five months before Karp 's death and quit three weeks after . Under " Reason for Leaving , " she told me , it said " Moving to Florida . " " I guess he decided to retire , " she said . Hal Gabriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely leaving his apartment , ordering in from the Chinese restaurant and the liquor store . There were half a dozen Chinese restaurants within a few blocks of his building at Ninety-second and West End . I did n't know which ones had been in business twelve years ago when Gabriel was found hanged , but I had n't yet known of a Chinese restaurant that employed Caucasian de livery boys . I checked the two liquor stores a block east on Broadway . Both had had recent changes of ownership . One had changed hands when the owner retired and moved to Miami . The owner of the other had been killed five years before in a robbery . No one in either store recognized James Shorter from the sketch . I had TJ along and we worked opposite sides of the street , showing the sketch in coffee shops and pizza parlors . The cowl terman at Poseidon looked at it and said , " Have n't seen him in years and years . Two scrambled dry , toasted English no butter . " He grinned at the expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Almost too good . I complimented him on it and went outside , and TJ reported the dry cleaner across the street had also made Shorter from the sketch , and recalled that his name was Smith . A LONG LINE OF DEAD MEN 245  | " Right , Smith , " I said . " And he did n't want any butter on his English muffin . " " Huh ? " " Smith ? And he happened to remember the guy from twelve years ago ? " " Was a woman , " TJ said . " An ' she remembers him because he never came back for his suit jacket . Lady kept it for him for years , finally gave it to the Goodwill sometime last year . Soon as I showed her the picture , she got scared she 's gon na get in trouble . I kep ' it a long time , ' she said .

A week after the body was discovered , Mr. Smith moved out and left no forwarding address . Rumpelstiltskin . I thought of him often , the evil dwarf from the fairy tale . I did n't know what Shorter had meant by the clue , or if it was in fact a clue at all . I followed a lot of very cold trails , looking for further traces of his presence near the scene of other deaths . It did n't matter . Nothing led anywhere . I have been detecting one way or another for so long that certain parts of the process have become virtually automatic for me . Now and then in recent years I have looked around for some other way to make a living , and invariably I have realized that this is what I do , that I am reasonably good at it , and that my experience and talent equip me for nothing else .

You go up one side of the street and down the other , you knock on every door , figuratively and literally , and each new piece of data clicks into place and points you toward a new street , with new doors to knock on . Finally you 've walked down enough streets and knocked on enough doors , and the final door opens and there 's your answer . It 's not easy and it 's rarely simple , but there is a logic to the way it unfolds . But it 's not always like that . Sometimes it 's like a jigsaw puzzle . You separatc all the
