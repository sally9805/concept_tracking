" Shift and shaft , " Ohio Governor George Voinovich calls it . The politicians and bureaucrats have a handy way to tax the public without seeming to do so . <p> " MANDARINIZATION " BEST DESCRIBES the past several decades or so of government activity . We are fast developing a powerful class of bureaucrats with almost arbitrary power over large parts of our daily life . We call them the Mandate Mandarins . <p> With their impulse to fund new programs thwarted by the voters ' antipathy to new taxes , the folks who govern us have turned to running our lives by other means . About a quarter of a century ago they figured out how to hand out goodies to special interests without seeming to tax the public for it : mandates . Today many things , from how your private pension is run to where your doctor hangs her coat in the morning , are mandated by the federal government . In the name of protecting us , it often oppresses us . <p> Richard Borrell is president of a small direct mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountant , bookkeeper and clerical worker-took ten weeks off after the birth of her child . That might not have mattered much at a big firm . It would simply have added enough staff to cover the people likely to take such leave . <p> But Borrell has only 45 employees . So he yanked somebody from another department to take over the job of the woman on leave and he and his wife , Cindy , put in 10-hour days to fill the gap . <p> The Borrells could have fallen afoul of the Family Leave Act of 1993 . He was forbidden , by law , from replacing his receptionist and required , by law , to continue paying her medical benefits . Passage of the act was something the White House could brag about in the 1996 election : See how we care about families ? But the Borrells and hundreds of thousands of other small business people are paying for it . <p> Family Leave is just one hassle in a vast system of mandates requiring people or business , or even the governments of states and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it strictly by rule . One slip-knowing or totally innocent-and you 've got the Mandarins on you . <p> Just ask Barbara Williams , owner of the Sunnyray Restaurant in Gettysburg , Pa . She is a fourth-party defendant , facing a fine of $76,253 , in a Superfund action that has been going on since 1993 . <p> Her crime ? The food scraps from her restaurant were dumped by her sanitation hauler , who was approved by her borough government , in a landfill which was approved by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania even after it was put on the Superfund Priority List in 1987 . Her paid garbage bills were taken as proof that she contributed to toxic waste . ( Remember , we are talking about food scraps . ) And if that is n't enough , the date of the suit is 1966 through 1996 , forcing Williams to produce records for the 15 years she has been in business . <p> Or take Cousins Submarines , a 107-shop fast-food chain based in Milwaukee , Wis. , which recently had to run a 45-minute training course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials like-ahem-bleach . " These are cleaning supplies ; it 's ridiculous , " says Bob Otto , a vice president . Add in dozens of such regulations to contend with , and the small business person 's life becomes a hell . <p> Mandates impose costs on big business , too , of course . To comply with an FDA mandate that stores check the age of anyone buying cigarettes who appears to be under 27 , The Kroger Co. , the Cincinnati , Ohio grocery chain , must train about a third of its 205,000 employees on the rule . As a double check on employees , the company is changing its scanners to stop whenever an age-specific product crosses the counter , a process which will slow checkout time . <p> Will that red tape save anyone from lung cancer ? Doubtful . But it made it possible for the FDA to pose as an anti-tobacco crusader . <p> Mandates function like a tax by raising the cost of the targeted activity . Take the expenditures necessary to carry out the vague affirmative action mandates of the Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanded , thus running up search costs , the workplace must be altered to accommodate disabled applicants and employees , and compliance must be demonstrated , which means time lost to paperwork . For most businesses this also involves additional legal costs in having lawyers vet compliance . <p> Supposedly all this helps disabled people . We say supposedly because so far it looks as if the chief beneficiaries will be perfectly able trial lawyers who use the act to sue businesses . Yet while the benefits are doubtful , every single business in the U.S.-and ultimately consumers-must pay the costs of enforcement . <p> An annoyance here , a cost there , who cares ? Consider this : A recent study by the Heritage Foundation found that although the average take-home pay in the U.S. is $9.84 an hour , mandated benefits of $3.26 and other regulations at $1.38 add another $4.64 an hour to employers ' wage costs . Note : The workers themselves have no voice in which benefits they can get . Would some of them prefer cash ? Tough luck . The law wo n't permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bad . In 1996 the cost to business came to $420 billion , according to Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester Institute of Technology . That 's about one-third of spending in the federal budget . <p> And just as the tax is levied in a multitude of ways , it is paid variously as well . <p> Sometimes business bears the burden in the form of lower profits for owners or shareholders . That 's what happened to Jim and Susanna House , owners of Tuf-Tow , Inc. , in Saginaw , Ala . Tuf-Tow , total work force of seven , made outdoor gear like Kevlar leg-guards , pants similar to chaps , that protect workers from chain saw accidents . In their best years , the Houses pulled in $180,000 in revenue . <p> Then came OSHA and a regulation that all chain saw chaps had to pass a testing process involving several washings in a commercial washer . Tuf-Tow 's Kevlar chaps , which could be washed without damage by hand , balled up in commercial washers . The Houses had to scotch the Kevlar line . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Houses and one other employee are all that remain of Tuf-Tow . <p> Sometimes , in the case of small business , the tax on business can result in bankruptcy . That 's just what Karla and Richard Hauk are afraid of . In 1993 , the Hauks pooled their life 's savings to hire an architect and contractor to build a 32-unit Days Inn motel in Wall , S. D. They included two handicapped-accessible rooms and cleared the plan with the Days Inn board . <p> Then the mandate Mandarins struck . In 1994 , inspectors from the Justice Department dropped by and generated six pages of problems , such as the fact that not every door was wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs and that an elevator was not provided to get to the whirlpool . The feds sued and the case is still in litigation . Expected damages are $250,000 . The Hauks cleared $20,000 on the motel last year . " We thought we had done everything we were supposed to , " says Karla Hauk , " this is going to kill us . " Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what Kent Swanson , the owner of Nurses Available , Inc. , does . Swanson 's Towson , Md. - based firm provides nurses and aids to nursing homes . The firm has about 150 workers , with three offices in two states . Swanson spends at least 20% of his time keeping up with old regulations and investigating new ones-mostly from OSHA and the Health Care Financing Administration . He figures that adds 10% to 20% to his $13-an-hour price for nurses . And sometimes the cost of mandates is absorbed by workers in the form of lower wages or fewer jobs . Lost jobs is just what happens , for instance , when a boost in the minimum wage is mandated . Indeed , there is even job loss that occurs in anticipation of the impact of a mandate . Since many mandates do n't kick in until a certain size in the work force is reached , firms stop hiring just short of the magic number . Capping employment at 9 workers leaves employers free from OSHA inspections for hazardous waste ; restricting workers to 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 19 workers exempts employers from extending health insurance to former employees ; staying under 50 workers frees firms from the Family Leave Act . <p> What smart business person would n't downsize in the face of all this ? Or move ? When companies move jobs overseas it is n't always in pursuit of cheaper labor but to escape punitive regulations . A recent study by the Cato Institute found that mandated field tests , which take years to complete , constitute 85% of the cost of developing new drugs in the U.S. <p> Using mandates to pursue social goals triggers the drawbacks inherent in any social engineering scheme : It enhances the authority of the bureaucracy over peoples ' lives ; and it forces everyone into a single mold . <p> Convenient for the politicians and bureaucrats , moreover , is that the use of mandates hides the actual size of the government 's scope and influence on the economy . Hopkins , who has been tracking the damage for many years , estimates that the economy-wide cost of regulation in 1996 was $677 billion . <p> When that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal budget , the federal government 's share of the economy comes to 30%-as opposed to just 17% of GDP for the federal budget alone . <p> Almost anyone in business has his or her own horror story . Anyone who has ever been involved in education knows how much mandates add to the costs and lower the standards in the schools . Figure it out . It 's not merely the ramps you need to build and the family leaves you have to have workers to fill , it 's the paperwork everyone must endure in order to comply ( see box , p. 198 ) . <p> Except for a respite during the Reagan years , the trajectory of government-by-mandate has been straight up for 25 years . Sure , every administration since Ford has had a showboat deregulatory effort ; but those were more to bust up industry monopolies than to get rid of regulations whose chief goal is to shift costs to the private sector . <p> For example , while the Bush Administration was moving forward on free trade , it signed off on three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Americans with Disabilities Act , both in 1990 , and the Civil Rights Act , which established the Glass Ceiling Commission to mandate diversity in the workplace , in 1991 . ( Amusingly , regulatory activity got so out-of-hand that Bush was forced to declare a 180-day moratorium on new regulations . ) <p> The Clinton Administration loves mandarinization : Just think , folks , all these good things and it wo n't cost you a dime in taxes . Maybe there is such a thing as a free lunch . One of Clinton 's first acts was to sign the Family Leave Act in 1993 ( Bush vetoed it twice ) . That was followed by the Brady Bill , forcing store owners to run background checks on gun buyers . <p> Unbowed by its failure to pass the mega-mother of mandated benefits-universal health insurance-the Clintonites gleefully went on to pass : an increase in the minimum wage ; a law requiring meat producers to install E. coli-detection equipment ; 48-hour maternity stays , and a guarantee of the portability and availability of insurance for those with preexisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal regulatory agencies has been fast and furious ; for example , OSHA fines increased tenfold during the first two years of the Clinton Administration . <p> Despite Al Gore 's rhetoric about reinventing government and cutting bureaucracy and red tape , figures from the Center for the Study of American Business tell a different story . During the past three years the administrative costs of federal regulatory activities for job safety and other workplace conditions rose 9.4% and federal agency staffing costs increased 6% . In general business regulations , administrative costs climbed 15% and staffing costs were up 8% . <p> Almost every mandate was originally a political response to a perceived problem . Each enhanced the power of a bureaucracy . None required raising taxes directly . Every one levied costs on the economy and on everyone 's standard of living . Were most of them worth the price ? Probably not ( see box , p. 200 ) . <p> More mandating may be in the offing . Clinton-Gore want to expand the Family Leave Act to include time off for PTA meetings and doctors ' appointments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , enlarging the definition of pollution . OSHA is hot to mandate employers to make ergonomic assessments of all office furniture and to post notices telling those who think they are suffering from " sick building syndrome " whom they can phone to complain . <p> But the worm may be turning.The first sign of serious resistance came with the Republican-controlled Congress in 1994 . <p> A bill requiring that major new regulations be subject to a risk-assessment and cost-benefit analysis passed the House but was defeated in the Senate by one vote . But the anti-regulatory forces persisted . In 1995 , Congress passed a law limiting unfunded mandates on state and local governments-the practice of shifting responsibility for federal programs to the localities without giving them the cash to carry out the provisions . ( This is the practice that George Voinovich , governor of Ohio , aptly characterized as " shift and shaft . " ) <p> In 1996 came the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act allowing small businesses to sue federal agencies over rules that are arbitrary or have not passed adequate cost-benefit analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress and the General Accounting Office before they become effective . <p> And finally , this year , Congress also passed legislation directing the Congressional Budget Office to provide a list of all the costs and benefits of federal regulation , along with suggestions on how to reform or eliminate many of them . <p> Some antimandate measures that failed in the last session are going to be reintroduced first thing in January . One is a regulatory accounting bill that would require agencies to produce a list of all costs and benefits of federal regulation every year and standardize cost-benefit analysis . Also promised are some really tough measures , like a regulation budget that allows Congress to cap the cost to the private sector for any new law ; and more stringent congressional oversight , whereby every rule must be sent to Congress for approval and Congress can revoke any law made in the past . <p> Says Congressman David McIntosh ( R-Ind . ) : " What we have been getting is death by a thousand cuts . If we do n't do something about it , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . " <p> That talk is n't cheap . Milton Friedman , the economist , plotted growth rates in the economy and regulation since 1945 . He found that growth was high in the period between 1946 and 1969 , but after 1969 it suffered a long-term slowdown . Guess what ? It was in 1969 that the Mandarins discovered the joys of mass mandates . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By Susan Lee and Daniel Roth <p> COST DEFECTIVE <p> APPLY COST-BENEFIT analyses to most mandates and no sensible person would want most of them . Although cost-benefit analyses have been required for major mandates since Ronald Reagan , Congress is just now putting some power behind the process . <p> To study the costs of major regulations , agencies are required to put a price on implementing expensive proposed rules-from requiring people to wear seat belts to banning asbestos-versus the number of lives saved or prolonged . That cost-per-life-year figure offers a quick way to judge the merit of possible regulations . <p> On average , the federal government values each life year at about $600,000 , according to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Enterprise Institute , a Washington-based think tank . Thus , in theory , if a new regulation saves the life of one 40-year-old it has " saved " the nation an undiscounted $18 million . <p> But many of the numbers produced by the bureaucrats are phony . Because agencies do their own analyses , the mandarins inflate the benefits of the rule and downplay its costs . <p> Among the worst offenders is OSHA . In 1987 the agency submitted a rule limiting the use of formaldehyde.Its argument : Five out of every 100,000 people exposed to the chemical would develop cancer . To stop each cancer case , OSHA figured the cost at between $5 million and $41 million . Looking closer at the agency 's arithmetic , however , the Office of Management &; Budget found that the real risk was one in a billion , which makes the cost more like$70 billion to stop each case of cancer . <p> Just failing a cost-benefit analysis does n't kill a mandate . Between 1990 and 1995 the Environmental Protection Agency accounted for about 75% of all rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cost-benefit test , according to Hahn . <p> This is where the new anti-Mandarins are stepping in . In March 1995 Congress required cost-benefit analyses for all regulations that impose more than $100 million on the private sector . To capture the real costs , agencies must consider lost productivity , economic decline and lost jobs in their analysis . <p> To keep agencies from getting too imaginative in their economic assumptions , Representative David McIntosh ( R-Ind. ) is submitting a bill this year that would force the agencies to standardize their methods . <p> And finally , a " regulatory budget " proposed by Representative Lamar Smith ( R-Tex. ) would cap the amount of costs regulators could impose on private businesses for any given law . Mandarins would have to use their cost-benefit analyses to find the biggest bang for their regulatory buck . <p> These measures are explicitly aimed at Mandarin excesses in federal agencies ; but they have an implicit target as well . By making the agencies accountable to Congress , Congress becomes accountable to the victims of mandates . It will be Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each member will be required to vote on specific rules . " No one elects bureaucrats , " says Wayne Crews of the Competitive Enterprise Institute . " The more we do to make Congress directly responsible , the better . " <p> Now that would be reinventing government . <p> RED SEA <p> In 1996 , according to estimates by Thomas Hopkins , economic professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology , the cost of paperwork required to comply with mandates came to $200 billion . <p> A survey done this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that almost half the firms questioned spent more than 5% of their annual budget on mandated compliance . The two most expensive areas were employee benefits ( mostly pensions ) and labor regulations . ( mostly OSHA ) . <p> Remember : This is just the cost of the red tape ; none of these regulations benefits employees directly . <p> Mandates also slow innovation . This is especially intense in the drug and medical device industry , where long approval times shorten effective patent life and thus reduce the overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for new drugs or technologies . <p> It costs too damn much to have the government " protect " us . <p>
