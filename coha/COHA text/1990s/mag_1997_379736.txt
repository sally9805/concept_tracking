Whatever one thinks about the Supreme Court 's landmark Roe v. Wade decision of 1973 , there can be little doubt of its judicial aggressiveness . At the time , the abortion issue , although hardly unsung , had been debated fully in only a few state legislatures . By grabbing the case , locating a previously unspecified right to abortion in the Constitution and telling the states to respect that right , the Justices effectively defined the issue and pre-empted a legislative solution . The result : the court was stuck particularizing its position for the next 20 years . <P> The last set of jurists one would expect to emulate that bravura act is the current , cautious Rehnquist panel . Yet last fall , with apparent gusto , it took on an explosive moral and ethical issue that energizes many of the same parties as abortion  --  and which has yet to be completely hashed out by elected officials . This Wednesday the court will hear arguments on two right-to-die cases , Vacco v. Quill and Washington v. Glucksberg . If they wish to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted-suicide proponent Timothy Quill , to " establish landmarks " for tackling the controversy . Or , perhaps more prudently , they will find a way to fudge it . <P> The issue  --  whether doctors , forsaking the Hippocratic oath , should be allowed to prescribe lethal doses of medication or actively help mortally ill patients end their lives  --  has been moving toward center stage at least since 1990 , when the court , in Cruzan v. Missouri Department of Health , established a patient 's right to be taken off life support . In 1991 , Quill , a New York physician , wrote in a medical journal about assisting a suicide . Meanwhile , retired Michigan pathologist Jack Kevorkian began a string of assisted or supervised deaths that now stands at 46 . Three times Michigan authorities charged Kevorkian with murder , and thrice juries cleared him . Oregon voters seemed of similar mind when , in 1994 , they passed a referendum allowing assisted suicide , and a nationwide Gallup poll in April showed that a 75% majority favored allowing doctors to end the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Oregon-like initiatives . <P> The high court will deliver its opinion on a pair of federal appeals-court decisions supporting the practice . Last spring Ninth Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote a fire-breathing opinion to overturn Washington 's assisted-suicide ban on behalf of three plaintiffs who had already died naturally . Choosing a dignified death , Reinhardt asserted , was a constitutional right under the 14th Amendment 's due-process protection of personal liberties and the principle of privacy defined in the court 's abortion rulings : " A competent , terminally ill adult " should not be forced to endure " a childlike state of helplessness , diapered , sedated , incompetent . " <P> A month later , a panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals voided a similar New York law , although less emphatically . The Second Circuit found no " cognizable " right to die in the Constitution , but ruled the current state of affairs unfair under the Equal Protection clause . If someone on life support can have a doctor kill him or her ( by pulling a plug ) , the court reasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not attached to a machine ? The high court will review the two cases together .
