You do n't take your eyes off Oliver for a minute  --  for one second , if he 's with another child . Or you will be explaining to Kerry and Ron or Jan and Tim how you let little Max or pretty Alexandra get that nasty bruise , or that unfortunate scratch . <p> Right now they 're doing okay , Oliver and Brett . They are the same age , within a month or so , though Oliver is half a head taller and ten pounds heavier . Brett is in second grade ; Oliver , of course , is in a special school . They are playing with Oliver 's Game Boy , a gift from his grandmother , who never manages to get the right size clothes , either . Actually , Brett is playing with the Game Boy . " Watch this , Oliver , " he says . <p> Oliver has picked up a piece of fiber optic cable somewhere and has it hanging out of his mouth . He grunts . " Coke coke coke . " <p> " Mr. Huth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brett says politely . <p> " Come on , Oliver . Coke coke coke , " you say . " How about you , Brett ? " <p> " No , thanks . " Concentrating on the Game Boy . <p> You take a step toward the kitchen . It 's Saturday . Laurie is at the doctor . You 're thinking about what your life would be like if you put Oliver in an institution ... if Laurie could get pregnant again , and you had a normal child . Then you hate yourself for thinking that , and while you 're hating yourself , Oliver turns around and goes up to Brett and yanks the Game Boy out of his hands . <p> You hear this and turn just in time to see Oliver clubbing Brett with it . <p> Brett has played with Oliver for most of his life . He knows when something awful is about to happen  --  he 's grown up in southern California and has been doing the earthquake dodge and roll since he could walk . He gets an arm in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall of the garage . <p> Because you feel responsible , you go to Brett rather than your son . " Sorry , " you say , since Oliver ca n't apologize . Brett has a gash on his arm and it hurts . The kid is trying to hold back tears . <p> Oliver is on his feet again , looking for that goddamn hunk of cable to chew on . He wanders off to sit in the flowers . Nothing seems to mark him . If he did n't rub the back of his head , you 'd swear he was a character in a Roadrunner cartoon . <p> You hold Brett under the medical scanner long enough to hear that you should give him some disinfectant and a Band-aid . Before long he goes back to the Game Boy . A little while later his mother Sarah comes to get him . You play back the tape from the backyard camera and give her a hard copy of the medical stuff She commiserates and says she understands , but you know it will be just that much harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And you wo n't be able to blame them . Because on Sunday Oliver will have taken a shit on the Persian rug in the living room then decided to stay up all that night screaming . And you wo n't want to play with Oliver again . You wo n't even want to see him . <p> There are many good things about the Naughts  --  speaking , of course , of the decade that officially began January 1st , 2001 . The ozone layer is recovering . Fewer people are going to bed hungry . Most nukes are out of their silos . There is an all-Brady Bunch Channel . Your house is smarter than you are . <p> In January 2001 , Oliver Huth was nineteen months old . Right about that time you and Laurie made friends with the Shaners , who had a boy named Brett almost exactly that age . You noticed right away that Brett was talking and Oliver was not . That Brett was paying attention to things and Oliver was not . That Brett would play and Oliver would ... drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably some kind of genius , then you did some surfing on the Home Pediatric Channel and decided maybe Oliver was n't quite developing properly . <p> You wondered how to raise this with Laurie . When it came to Oliver , she was living on a river in Egypt ; you were spending time on De Nile yourself . Eventually it was plain for everyone to see that Oliver , your big , strong , healthy , handsome baby boy , was a low-functioning autistic . ( Or something like that : every time a new genome map gets released the labels change . ) Oliver was never going to be a bundle of love snuggling into a warm bed in the morning . He was never going to sing the ABCs with his front tooth missing . He was n't going to play baseball , though he might beat the shit out of you with a bat if he felt like it . He did n't even stay handsome <p> Year One , Year Two , Year Three of the Naughts . You staggered forward , finding more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Laurie were almost too scared to even fuck . What if you rolled snake eyes again ? <p> But lately things have settled into a rhythym that can either be a routine or a rut , depending on the weather and Oliver 's mood . Laurie sells things from the house , part-time . You work for the state . For several glorious hours , five days a week , Oliver is someone else 's responsibility . <p> That Saturday afternoon , an hour after the latest incident , Oliver is zoned out in front of the TV watching Rain Man when Laurie comes home , dropping some brochures on the dining room table . She looks bad  --  a face you have seen often enough  --  and you know you have to ask . " Our maps came in , " she says . " Doctor Reyes is advising us not to have any more children . " <p> " Advising . Not telling . What are they going to do , Laurie ? Put us in genetic jail ? <p> You feel defiant on general principles  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor , Reyes  --  but you recall your mother 's history of depression , and your sister 's son , who is only slightly better off than Oliver  --  and know that Reyes has a case . <p> Laurie sits down on the couch next to Oliver , stroking his head . " Do n't put him to sleep , " you say , but it 's already too late . Asleep he could pass for normal . You can dream a little . <p> " Did you look at the brochure ? " Laurie says , nodding toward some papers on the table . You pick them up . Several flyers about adoption . And one from something called Landis Industries . " For the Special Child . " Landis wants to sell you an autonomous therapeutic companion substitute . It 's a dinosaur doll of some kind named Jinx . " What is this ? Some kind of robot playmate ? " <p> " It sounded interesting for Oliver . " <p> " It also sounds expensive . " <p> " It 's still experimental . Doctor Reyes knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So we could get this thing for free ? " <p> " All we have to do is waive liability and allow them to make records . " <p> " There goes the old privacy . " <p> " What privacy is that , Neil ? " She puts a blanket over Oliver , then walks past you toward the kitchen . " Besides , they 're coming out Monday . " <p> MONDAY YOU roll out of bed with two whole hours of sleep . The house , having monitored the noise level throughout the evening , apologizes for waking you , but that 's its job . Laurie deals with Oliver , who somehow must be made ready for school , while you get showered and dressed . <p> You are backing out of the driveway with Oliver when you see the Landis van pull up . It 's an ordinary van ; might as well belong to the phone company , except for the holo of Jinx on the side . Its goofy little eyes move toward Oliver and the damn thing says , " Hi there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truck track truck ! " he sings . " Hi hi hi ! " And tries to unbuckle his seatbelt . <p> " You 'll see him later , " you say , pointlessly , knowing Oliver 's already going to be late for school . <p> When you 've gotten Oliver safely inside the classroom , a process which is never routine , you notice posters of Jinx here and there around the school . You figure Jinx is just one of those kids ' TV characters you 've so far managed to avoid . <p> As you buckle back into your car , you see the kids from the normal part of the school , pushing and shoving the way you remember doing . You refuse to believe that your life is passing without this . You know the feeling is irrational ... that many people pass through life sitting in wheelchairs , for God 's sake , or selling french fries , or in general being lots unhappier than you for much better reasons . Still . You want a child . A normal one . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house stuff , and give us this little guy . " Laurie is holding a notebook and nodding toward Jinx , who stands there in the middle of the room , maybe three feet tall , wearing nothing but orange fuzz . " Fur , " Laurie corrects you , since you do n't realize you 're speaking . <p> The deal is , Laurie picks up Oliver at two-thirty , which makes sense considering that you do n't get home till six . ( And at least once a week you 've got a perfectly good excuse to be even later . ) So you figure Jinx will be fully operational out in the yard , or returned for reprogramming by the time you get home . But no , Laurie has waited and you must participate . Jinx stands in the living room . <p> You try to pick him up , nearly aggravating your hernia . " I would n't do that , Neil . He weighs almost two hundred pounds , " Laurie says . <p> " I 'm glad somebody was paying attention during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A power pack that we have to recharge every other night . " <p> " Does he take care of that himself ? Or do we have to plug him in ? " " We do . " She is getting exasperated . Oliver has been left alone in the hallway for maybe four whole minutes , a new record . You can hear him breathing . " I guess we should introduce them , " you say . <p> With a last glance at her notebook , Laurie opens the door . Oliver is standing there completely naked and baffled . You can see the confusion vanish from his eyes when he sees Jinx . " Hi , " the orange thing says . It has a cute little voice ; it almost sings . Oliver is too pleased to speak . <p> He comes right up to Jinx and starts to poke at him . <p> You turn to Laurie . " It talks ? " <p> " Not really . It 's got a vocabulary of a hundred words . They say it 's supposed to match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet that Oliver knew a hundred words . Maybe three he could repeat thirty-three and a third times . <p> " Backyard , " Oliver is saying . <p> " Get dressed first , " you start to say ... but Jinx beats you to it . " Clothes , " it says , and mils off toward Oliver 's bedroom . Oliver obediently follows . <p> You and Laurie are a step behind . You watch in stupefied amazement as Oliver picks up his clothes , which have been wadded on the floor , and puts them on . " He 's never dressed himself before , " you say to Laurie . <p> " Well , not in his own clothes , " she says , which makes you wonder for a moment . " He 's been pretty goddamn good at getting them off , though . " <p> Oliver has his shirt on backwards , but Jinx grabs it with one of his flippers and tugs it enough so that the boy gets the message . " Backyard , " Jinx says , and out they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . He does n't really have legs , just supports and wheels that have limited independent mobility . " I think we 're going to have to put in a ramp , " you say , pleased to have found a hidden cost . <p> " They said the house was fine as is , " Laurie tells you , as Jinx pitches forward on his little orange face . He squeals , and Oliver ca n't move fast enough to get to him . It is n't necessary , though . Jinx extends one of his flipper things , rolling himself to one side ... then both flippers extend , pushing him upright . <p> " Play ? " Jinx says . Oliver laughs his really annoying laugh , then belts Jinx really hard . It does n't hurt Jinx , of course , and does n't even hurt Oliver much . He shakes his hand , and gives up that idea . <p> Then he climbs up on Jinx . " Ride ride ride , " he says . And Jinx begins to roll around the backyard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired . " I was wrong , " you tell Laurie . " I 'd be happy to plug Jinx into his recharger any time he wants it . He 's earned it . " <p> The next week , with Jinx keeping Oliver busy , comes dose to that dreamlike ideal you have always imagined for parents with normal children . You find yourself hurrying through work because you look forward to coming home . With Oliver on such a rigorous schedule he 's out cold each night , so you and Laurie actually start to get some sleep . Since you do n't see Oliver sticking his filthy hands into your plate of pasta , you find that your appetite is returning . <p> Laurie is getting more work done and enjoying it more . Maybe it 's those free time conversations about fertility brokers and all this talk about babies , because she 's looking sexier . On Sunday morning , after six days of Jinx , the two of you make love successfully for the first time in four and a half months , though , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you drift back to sleep , is " We must do this again sometime . " <p> Laurie laughs and says , " Did we even turn off the cameras ? " The house was watching , of course , as Laurie ran into the bedroom for her diaphragm . Surveillance is part of the security system . Lazily you find the privacy switch , and show Laurie that it 's still off . " Oh , well , " she says . <p> On Monday , the beginning of week two with Jinx , the man from Landis stops by to check him out . And you offer him money , whatever it will take to keep Jinx . " Your wife explained about the monitoring ? " he says . You nod . " Then you know that he 's free as long as we 're able to monitor his development . " <p> " Well , then , how is Jinx developing ? " <p> " I 'm seeing some physical wear and tear , " he says , " but nothing we ca n't take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to laugh out loud . Every time you see Oliver , he 's trying to beat the shit out of Jinx . It 's just Oliver 's way of showing love and you 're happy that it 's Jinx on the receiving end instead of Brett Shaner . " The power use has been higher than anticipated , but we have a better class of battery on the way . " The man looks at the house . " Any interface problems ? " <p> " The house ? I think it 's getting along fine with Jinx . " <p> " Good . Jinx 's systems are totally reliant on monitoring and data from your house . Take him out of your yard and he 's just a big paperweight . " <p> You realize that you might not be quite ready to take Oliver on a trip out of town . But , then , you have more energy to deal with him here , now . <p> It 's not as though life has suddenly gone golden . You come home midweek and find Laurie sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver do something ? " It 's the first thing you think of . <p> " No , he 's fine . " You can see him with Jinx in the backyard . " I spent the morning talking to the lawyer about our options . " She means your baby options . " What Dr. Reyes said seems to be true . No one will help us . " <p> " What do we mean when we say no one ? " <p> " I mean , no clinic will assist us in overcoming our ... problem . " Your problem is that you do n't get pregnant very easily . Laurie had two miscarriages before Oliver was born . You know you should n't even bother with birth control . " As long as we 're using my genes and your genes , no one 's going to match us up ... not with a host mother , not with a sperm donor . Nothing . " <p> You sigh , trying to be helpful . " There 's always adoption . " <p> Laurie looks at you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought we went through all that . " As if you needed to be reminded about what you went through , after the two miscarriages , trying to adopt . The host-mother you flew out from Provo who simply ran up some big bills in the apartment you rented for her , then went home three weeks before the scheduled birth . What were you going to do ? Have her extradited ? The girl who almost gave up the baby ... the baby you were allowed to see , but not touch , because the girl changed her mind . <p> You 're feeling a mixture of desperation and defiance . You take Laurie in your arms and kiss her . " There 's always the old-fashioned way . " <p> For a moment she seems confused . Then she pulls back and smiles . " Like you say , they ca n't put us in jail . " <p> IN YOUR HEAD you know you and Laurie have a bad genetic history . There 's Oliver , after all . But you also know that it 's damned unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friends and contemporaries have children in school . Their lives revolve around their activities . You are slowly being left out , since Oliver 's activities have less and less to do with those of a normal child . Worst of all , you 're finding yourself spending all your time with the parents of other special children , an understandably obsessed bunch  --  people you would n't choose to spend time with . <p> What you really hate is having your choices made by someone else . But you can do something about it . <p> You and Laurie both know the drill , since you 've done this three times already . You were pretty scientific about getting pregnant before . Dates of ovulation , body temperatures , you know it by heart . The key thing is to do it . And with Jinx keeping Oliver busy , you sort of feel like doing it . <p> You ca n't be too cold blooded about it , however . Part of you wonders if maybe that was n't the reason the Oliver conception went wrong  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time it 's dinner out , a little romance , something out of a wine commercial . With Jinx on the case , you can even engage a sitter . And go out . And come home to find her sleepy , as sitters should be , with Oliver sound asleep in bed . " Where 's Jinx ? " you ask Laurie . <p> " Standing watch , " she says , pushing the door back to show you . There he is ... a perfect little orange sentry in the darkened comer of Oliver 's room . <p> You pay the sitter , who actually says she might be free again next weekend  --  this is a new experience with sitters for Oliver  --  and she goes home . And you and Laurie relax on the couch . The TV is on ... she flips it over to some racy movie . And , like teenagers , you start peeling each other . It 's a relief not to think about protection or control . You stop bothering with the clothes and enter her . <p> And stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room . You 're almost too far gone to care . He is , after all , a machine . Would you fuck in front of the lawn mower ? Next question . <p> Jinx burps or makes some damn machine noise , then rolls back to wherever he lurks . But Laurie is rolling away from you and sheepishly pulling herself together . " God , we have n't even closed the drapes . " <p> You want to grumble that you were on the floor and anyway it 's after midnight , and those theoretical peeping Toms are actually criminals , not people you are going to see at the market tomorrow . But it 's too late . You are both a little tipsy and a lot tired , and there is no completion . <p> That 's Saturday night . On Sunday you take Oliver to a movie , then let him go wild with Jinx until dinner . You and Laurie start necking in the bedroom , door only slightly ajar , while the boy and his machine are in the backyard . And damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Coke coke coke " just as it 's about to get serious . <p> One thing leads to another , and the golden moment  --  that is , the time of greatest conception  --  passes . Laurie has her period , and you have a couple of nights of free and passionate fucking , with no interruptions , which only makes it all the more infuriating when it starts happening again . <p> " It 's Jinx , " you tell Laurie . Oliver 's fuzzy orange companion has been with you now for six weeks . You feel terrible saying anything critical , since this has been the happiest six weeks you 've had since Oliver was maybe two . <p> " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " Laurie says . So you walk her through the evidence , which basically comes down to this : every time the two of you try to make a baby , something interrupts . She ca n't question the data . " You make it sound like some kind of plot . How is it being done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every move you make . " The house has cameras and microphones and I suppose it even knows how much money we 're not spending on Ortho-Gynol , " you say , " but basically it 's about as dangerous as a refrigerator . " <p> " Then who or what is doing it ? " <p> " Jinx . It 's hooked into the house , now . The house watches and Jinx goes to work . " <p> " Fine , " she says , humoring you in your paranoia . " Why ? Just tell me why someone does n't want us to have sex . " <p> " It 's not the sex , " you say , " it 's making a baby . " And Laurie , who is smarter than you in most things , anyway , opens her mouth to correct you , then shuts it again . <p> " That 's a pretty serious accusation , " Dr. Reyes says . He is sitting in the living room having coffee . You can see Oliver and Jinx in the den next door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceiving a child . " <p> " Why ? Nobody wants us to conceive a child . Including , if I 'm not mistaken , you . " <p> Reyes looks at you , at Laurie , and sets down his cup . " You two are lucky . " <p> " Why do you say that ? " Laurie snaps . <p> " Because you have good lives . " Before I can yank his head around to make sure he sees Oliver , who is plucking orange fur out of Jinx , who is looking distinctly more threadbare , he adds : " I do n't mean you 've never been disappointed . Or that you 're going to get whatever you want . I mean that , compared to much of the human race , you both grew up in happy , stable homes . " <p> " What has that got to do with anything ? " <p> " The genome maps are showing us that most of what we think of as bad behavior , whether it 's tendencies toward violence or substance abuse , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're dealt . " <p> " Nature , not nurture . " <p> " Nature more than nurture . Absolutely . We 're just beginning to realize how ... people can be different . How lives can be improved by this knowledge . We ca n't select from a genetic menu to make a perfect baby ... yet . That 's years away . But we can ... assist people with their choices , and thereby save a whole generation from abuse , neglect , pain . " He spreads his hands , looking genuinely sorry . " Genetically , you two should never have gotten together . Your maps make one of the worst fits I 've seen . " <p> " Maybe we should just get divorced . " Divorce has become an ugly word in the Naughts . <p> " Neil . " Laurie knows about your temper , especially where Reyes is concerned . Even Reyes can see that he 's cut a little too deeply . After a moment he says , " We 're not dictators . There 's no conspiracy . Your ... situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of this , either . " How clever . Of our ' situation , ' that is . " <p> " Why could n't you tell us in the first place ? " Laurie says suddenly . " Why turn us into lab rats ? " <p> " I did tell you . " <p> " So what is Jinx , then ? " you say . " The first step in some giant social engineering program ? " <p> " No , " Reyes says . " Jinx was developed for kids like Oliver . We only thought of the ... opportunity for positive reinforcement later . " <p> " Suppose we tell you to take that thing out of here ? " <p> Reyes stands . " We are n't dictators . We 're simply giving you an option . " And he goes out . <p> The rest of the afternoon seems long . Laurie calls the Landis people , and even though it is a weekend , they promise to get right over . You let Jinx and Oliver play in the backyard one more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurie looks at the houses around you . " I wonder how many of our friends should n't be together ... should n't have children . " <p> " From what I 've seen , I 'd say all of them . " But you know that 's unfair . You are good friends with perhaps six couples in the neighborhood . Four of them are doing fine . Their kids are happy and healthy . Of the other two , one couple is a clear mismatch across class and educational barriers , if nothing else : you know they 've been in therapy because both of them are abusive , and you know their kids are going to carry on that family tradition . It might have been better for all concerned if someone had ... intervened . <p> You think about what will happen over one generation , two , ten , with a little science invading the areas of mating and reproduction . Will people be happier ? Will people be better ? <p> You think over these past six weeks with Jinx , and you know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning on your shoulder , as the sound of Oliver 's relatively happy laughter reverberates off the houses , as Jinx patiently , tirelessly keeps him busy . <p> " We ca n't , " you tell her . " Jinx is for us , too . " She looks at you through tears for just a moment before she goes out into the yard . You are hearing the sound of a little voice saying ABCs ... saying " I love you Morn and Dad " ... kicking the ball and smiling . From the kitchen window you see Laurie holding hands with Oliver , holding on to Jinx . <p> The voices fade . You realize some of the tears are yours . You wipe them away , then get up to cancel the Landis cancellation . <p> <p> By Leo Kenden <p> " Jinx " marks Leo Kenden 's first appearance in F &SF.; Kenden has held a number of jobs in the software business , has written in other fields , and lives in the Southwest .
