CONVENIENCE STORE EATS THAT BRING YOU BACK FROM THE BRINK RE EATS THAT BRING YOU BACK FROM THE BRINK // I met the Grim Reaper face-to-face during a 120-mile tour on a deserted forest road in central Oregon . I 'd started riding at 7 a.m. in persistent , driving rain with temperatures in the mid-40s . As I climbed , the rain turned to sleet . Despite good rain gear and layers of clothing , I ca n't remember ever feeling colder or more desperate . I began to lose contact with my arms , feet and brain . It was then that the ghostly figure carrying the big scythe appeared out of the mist . Lucky for me , the Grim Reaper was standing in the parking lot of a convenience store ; that traveler 's haven of food , fluids and shelter . I ducked in , downed three hot chocolates , soup , and a couple of donuts . Still sh-sh-sh-shaking , I managed to get back on my bike for the rest of the ride . The black-hooded apparition receded into the shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick marts . But finding a store is the easy part . Once there , what should you eat to bring yourself back from the dead ? How much carbohydrate and sodium do you need to jump-start your battered body , and what are the healthiest choices with the least fat ? // ARE YOU COLD AND WET ? EAT THIS : // First , diagnose the problem . You 're probably dehydrated , so one goal is to chug a quart ( four cups ) or more of fluid . Next , replenish energy stores by stocking up on calories-especially carbohydrate . As a guideline , 600 or more calories with at least 100 grams of carbohydrate should help rev your motor . Also , a Scottish study found that consuming 1,000 mg of sodium with a quart of liquid helps you retain any fluid you drink-so take in some salt . If you look at the chart below , you 'll probably think we 're out of our minds . Hot dogs ? Ice cream ? Of course you should n't eat these fat-laden foods every day-but when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Frankenstein 's monster . However , for good health , the percentage of calories from fat usually should be 30% or less . These items are designated with a heart icon in the " Nutrition Info " column . Convenience stores also have ibuprofen to ease the pain , plus lifesavers like plastic bags for makeshift raingear . And make use of the hand dryer in the bathroom . Still comatose ? Head for the phone booth . After all , what are friends for ? // ARE YOU DEHYDRATED , EXHAUSTED , OVERHEATED ? EAT THIS : // <p>
