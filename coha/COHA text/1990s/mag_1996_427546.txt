How the conservative press is recruiting and training its own <p> THE DARTMOUTH REVIEW , THE RANCOROUS , ultra-conservative Ivy League student newspaper , has been grabbing headlines for a long time . Back in 1988 , " 60 Minutes " traveled to the Hanover , N.H. , campus to report on the paper 's racially tinged confrontation with an African American professor over the quality of his teaching methods  --  an incident that led to the university 's suspension of three Review editors for invasion of privacy and disorderly conduct . What 's received less public attention is that conservative organizations have spent millions of dollars in recent years cloning the Dartmouth paper at over 100 top-ranked colleges and universities . And the papers are not merely carrying the right 's banner into campus debates . They are turning out a new generation of conservative thinkers and writers who are taking up high-profile posts in conservative public policy circles . <p> Past editors of the papers include many of the rising stars at the think tanks , journals , and other institutions that shape the right-of-center agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Marc Thiessen , now Jesse Helms 's press spokesman at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ; the Wesleyan Review 's Matthew Rees , a staff writer at The Weekly Standard ; the Virginia Advocate 's Rich Lowry ; the national political writer at the National Review ; the Michigan Review 's Jonathan J. Miller , vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity ; the Northwestern Review 's Lynne Munson , recently Lynne Cheney 's top staffer at the American Enterprise Institute and now in the policy office of the Dole campaign ; the Princeton Sentinels Ruth Shalit , an associate editor for The New Republic , and the University of Iowa 's Campus Review columnist David Mastio , now an editorial writer and op-ed page editor at USA Today . At 29 , Theissen is the oldest of the group . <p> Driving the conservative student newspaper movement are some of the nation 's biggest right-leaning foundations . The single largest funder is the New York-based John M. Olin Foundation . Endowed by a firearms fortune , Olin spends about $200,000 a year in support of conservative campus journalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The foundation also bankrolls the Hudson Institute , a conservative think tank , and the National Association of Scholars , an organization of conservative college professors . And right-wing commentators William Bennett ( the John M. Olin fellow at the Heritage Foundation ) , Robert Bork , and David Brock have written books under Olin grants , as has Dinesh D'Souza , the best-selling culture critic who helped launch the Dartmouth Review a decade ago . Says James Piereson , Olin 's executive director , of the foundation 's campus newspaper crusade : " We 're fighting a war of ideas . We want to reach the nation 's future leaders ? ' It 's a war , conservatives contend , that pits the conservative David against the liberal Goliath . <p> But while mainstream student papers outnumber their conservative counterparts , the financial muscle behind the right 's campus crusade belies the image of conservative student scribes as poor underdogs . Other notable backers include the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation , a funder of David Brock 's attacks on Anita Hill ( " a little bit nutty and little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major benefactor of right-wing think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and the Free Congress Foundation ; and the Adolph Coors Foundation . <p> The bulk of foundation donations are funneled through conservative tax-exempt organizations like the Intercollegiate Studies Institute , Inc. , a non-profit conservative advocacy group located outside Wilmington , Delaware . Headed by former Reagan White House policy guru T Kenneth Cribb Jr. , the ISI runs the Collegiate Network , an alliance of 56 conservative campus papers . With over $300,000 a year from Olin , Scaife , and other foundations , the Collegiate Network works to launch new publications and strengthen existing ones . <p> The Network 's financial largesse is crucial . Member papers receive grants as large as $3,000 a year , and with the low cost of desktop publishing , the cash goes a long way . But the organization 's contributions go beyond the purely financial . The Network publishes a 92-page guide , " Start the Presses ! , " offering publishing novices advice on topics ranging from news gathering to ad sales . It also sponsors two , expenses-paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone links to the Network 's staff ; and provides a steady flow of story ideas . Its latest offering : a site on the World Wide Web , where a number of its member papers are available electronically . <p> Most of the new conservative papers publish monthly , are free , and are distributed alongside " official " student publications in dorm lobbies , student unions , libraries , and other common areas . Their mainstream rivals frequently have larger press runs and publish more often , usually daily or weekly . But the conservative papers attract readers nonetheless  --  not because today 's students are more conservative ; surveys reveal that they are n't . Rather , the papers are a presence on their campuses because they challenge the prevailing Zeitgeist on a range of emotional issues . They are hard to ignore . <p> Like the Dartmouth Review , the new papers wage a relentless battle against speech codes , affirmative action , black studies , women 's studies , gay rights , ethnic housing , and the " anti-conservative " bent of established campus papers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ronald Reagan , Phyllis Schlafly , Pat Buchanan , and , of course , D'Souza . <p> The publications are at times thoughtful , at times witty . The Duke Review recently ran a funny dig at " MasterCard Marxists " on the university 's faculty . In other instances the papers engage in unwitting self-parody . " The Doctor of Democracy has employed all of his considerable talent on loan from God to create his greatest work of insight yet , " gushed the University of North Carolina 's Carolina Review about Rush Limbaugh 's latest right-wing screed , See , I Told You So . <p> But while the campus papers play a valuable role as a forum for conservative opinions , their methods are at times dubious . The inaugural issue of the four-year-old Carolina Review suggested that President Clinton 's " frequent policy shifts are caused by variations in Hillary 's menstrual cycle ? Last year , The Duke Review ran a headline , " Being Queer for Credit . " In another story , it disparaged a faculty member as a " penis-envying ... ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the antagonistic tone of some of the papers seems aimed more at escalating the volume than the quality of the debate . <p> Indeed , the more confrontational articles provoke outrage . Last winter , the Carolina Review 's depiction of a Jewish candidate for student body president with horns and a trident ( a common characterization of Jews by anti-Semites ) led to an outcry from Jewish faculty members and a public rebuke by the university 's chancellor . Often , backlash against the papers takes the form of guerrilla warfare . After Right Reason , a new conservative publication at Notre Dame , ran editorials last spring backing the university 's refusal to recognize a student gay and lesbian group , the group 's members swiped 2,000 copies of the paper , then went on local television news to defend the heist . Contrary to conventional wisdom , the papers ' editors are n't all WASPy guys in wingtips . Women edit about a dozen of the publications , and there are a smattering of African American editors , including the recent opinion editor of the three-year-old Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price for their conservative allegiances . Jenny Choo , a past editor of the Redwood Review at the University of California-Santa Cruz , was branded a " banana " - yellow on the outside , white in the middle  --  by fellow Asian American students after she wrote an editorial urging the university to cut back its attempts to promote mulficulturalism in the face of a budget crunch . <p> In addition to helping conservative journalists establish a presence on campus , the Collegiate Network plugs them into the conservative advocacy industry . It runs a summer lecture program in Washington where several dozen editors receive the conservative gospel from  --  and rub shoulders with  --  the likes of Bennett , Bork , Cheney , William Kristol , and other big names on the Right . The Network also brokers valuable stepping-stone jobs for its editors . It has funded year-long internships at The New Republic and currently pays for a staffer at The Weekly Standard Shalit , author of a widely debated piece on racial hiring at The Washington Post , landed at The New Republic on a Network internship afar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Rees , who worked with TNR 's conservative pundit Fred Barnes after editing the Review at Wesleyan University in Connecticut . Theissen got his first break , an internship in the Reagan White House , through the Network as a junior at Vassar . <p> Many staffers at conservative campus publications also participate in expenses-paid internships sponsored by the National Journalism Center , an affiliate of the Education and Research Institute , a right-wing organization headed by M. Stanton Evans . NJC interns spend six weeks working with the center 's staff and another six working with writers and editors at conservative media like Human Events and National Empowerment Television . Bernadette Malone , the 1993-1994 editor of the Binghamton Review at the State University of New York at Binghamton , interned through the Center last year with conservative columnist and talks show host Robert Novak . Malone is now a full-time Novak staffer . John Fund of The Wall Street Journals editorial page is another notable NJC alumnus . <p> No less important to the movement is the Leadership Institute , a tax-exempt conservative group headed by Morton Blackwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans during the 1960s . Largely with funds garnered from direct mail efforts ( Blackwell worked for conservative direct-mail guru Richard Viguerie in the 1970s ) , the Institute provides grants to start conservative student papers and trains the papers ' staffs through the " student publications schools " it runs in Washington and around the nation . Participants in the two-day sessions get nuts-and-bolts advice on starting conservative student publications , including lectures on " fighting the campus left . " Recent presenters include Major Garrett , the Washington Times political correspondent , and Kevin Pritchett , the former Dartmouth Review editor and Wall Street Journal editorial page staffer who is now an aide to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott . <p> Conservatives may grouse about the hurdles they face in getting their perspectives heard in the media . But if the swelling ranks of influential alumni of the student newspaper network are a measure , conservatives do n't need to be pitied so much as emulated . Conservative organizations have secured their voice on campus by offering students a moveable feast of money , contacts , and programs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one can argue that the right is n't getting a substantial return on its investment . <p> BY THOMAS TOCH <p> <p> THOMAS TOCH , a senior editor at U.S. News and World Report , is writing a book about the privatization of schools . <p>
