THE FOURTH AMEND-ment 's protection against " unreasonable searches and seizures " can be enforced in two ways . One is to exclude evidence found through an illegal search . The other is to sue the police for conducting an illegal search . <p> Both enforcement tools took a hit at the U.S. Supreme Court in a pair of decisions handed down in mid-January . Together , they send a message to judges that in close search cases , the edge goes to law enforcement , not the protection of privacy . <p> In Herring v. United States , the justices said the exclusionary rule is not triggered when the police negligently or unwittingly violate the Fourth Amendment . And in Pearson v. Callahan , they said the police can not be sued if they enter a house without a warrant after receiving a signal from an informer inside . The court said the law in this area is not " clearly established , " so the police are immune from liability . <p> Stanford Law School associate professor Jeffrey Fisher says the court is undercutting privacy rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and the legs . They are curbing the exclusionary rule and making it nearly impossible to win civil damages at the same time , " says Fisher , who represented Bennie Herring . He says of Callahan : " It worries me that they are openly inviting the lower courts to avoid deciding the Fourth Amendment questions . " <p> L : UNCERTAIN FUTURE THE COURT 'S OPINION IN HERRING prompted much talk about the future of the exclusionary rule . Washington , D.C. , attorney Thomas Goldstein predicts it will prove as a matter of criminal law to be " one of the most important rulings in that field in the last quarter century . " A headline in the New York Times declared that the court was a " step closer to repeal " of the exclusionary rule . <p> But talk of repeal runs into at least one difficulty : Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , one of the five justices in the Herring majority , said three years ago that he would not be on board . " The continued operation of the exclusionary rule , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , " he wrote while concurring in Hudson v. Michigan . <p> In that case , a 5-4 majority ruled that the exclusionary rule is not triggered if the police , with a search warrant , enter a home without pausing for 10 seconds to announce their presence . George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr , a Fourth Amendment expert and a former Kennedy clerk , plays down the Herring decision . " It is more evolutionary than revolutionary , " he says . <p> Nonetheless , the decisions have revived the debate about how the Fourth Amendment is to be enforced . The exclusionary rule has a long history , as well as famous detractors . In 1914 , the court adopted the federal exclusionary rule in a case in which agents had searched a Kansas City , Mo. , man 's home for illegal lottery tickets while he was at work . <p> " His right to be secure against such searches and seizures is of no value and ... might as well be stricken from the Constitution " if it can be ignored with impunity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , in People v. Defore , then-New York Judge Benjamin Cardozo spoke for skeptics when he declared that the exclusionary rule meant the criminal " shall go free because the constable has blundered . " <p> The exclusionary rule went national in 1961 when the Warren court applied it to state and local police in Mapp v. Ohio . In that case , officers without a search warrant forced open the door of Dollree Mapp 's home and found obscene materials hidden in a trunk . Justice Tom Clark said the " right to be secure against rude invasions of privacy " is protected by the Fourth Amendment , and " we can no longer permit that right to remain an empty promise . " <p> But in the 1980s , the Reagan administration launched an effort to weaken or repeal both the exclusionary rule and the Miranda doctrine . Among the young lawyers working toward that end were John G. Roberts Jr. , Samuel A. Alito Jr . and Clarence Thomas . <p> Three years ago , they joined the Hudson opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on shaky ground . " Suppression of evidence has always been our last resort , not our first impulse , " Scalia wrote . " The exclusionary rule generates substantial social costs , which sometimes include setting the guilty free . " <p> How then can the Fourth Amendment be enforced ? Scalia suggested suing the police . After 1961 , the court had opened the door to suing local officials in federal courts , he said . And Congress authorized attorney fees for successful civil rights plaintiffs , even if their recovery is small . " As far as we know , civil liability is an effective deterrent , " Scalia wrote . " We can not assume that exclusion ... is necessary deterrence simply because we found that it was necessary deterrence in different contexts and long ago . " Kennedy agreed with most of Scalia 's opinion . <p> With the exclusionary rule in some doubt , the court took up Herring , which turns on an arrest warrant that should have been removed from a police computer . <p> Mark Anderson , a police investigator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennie Herring . When he saw Herring leaving the police station on an unrelated matter , Anderson asked a warrants clerk to check Herring 's name for outstanding warrants . A clerk in a neighboring county reported there was a warrant for Herring 's arrest . <p> Acting on that information , Anderson stopped Herring 's pickup truck and found methamphetamine in his pocket and a handgun under the seat . About 10 minutes later , the officer learned there had been a mistake . The arrest warrant had been withdrawn five months earlier , but that fact had not been entered in the police department 's computer . <p> Chief Justice Roberts said a " negligent bookkeeping error " by the police does not call for suppressing the evidence . He recast the exclusionary rule as less rule and more case-by-case balance  --  with the weight on the side of preserving the evidence . The " judiciary-created " exclusionary rule is " not an individual right , " Roberts said , but a means to deter unlawful conduct by the police . <p> " The benefits of deterrence must outweigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include " letting guilty and possibly dangerous defendants go free . ... The exclusionary rule serves to deter deliberate , reckless or grossly negligent conduct , " he added , not innocent or honest mistakes by officers . Justices Scalia , Kennedy , Thomas and Alito agreed . <p> L : NO BRIGHT LINE PEARSON V. CALLAHAN WAS A METH case as well , but it posed the issue of whether the police can be sued for violating the Fourth Amendment . <p> Agents of the Central Utah Narcotics Task Force gave a $100 bill to an informer to buy meth from the trailer home of Afton Callahan . Shortly after he was allowed to enter , the informer signaled to the agents , who entered without a warrant and arrested Callahan . <p> The Utah state courts ruled the police raid was an unconstitutional invasion and threw out the evidence . Callahan then sued Cordell Pearson and several other agents . Callahan 's civil suit was tossed on summary judgment by the federal trial court , but reinstated by the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory for Callahan without ruling whether a home search is constitutional if it is based on a third party 's consent . <p> Justice Alito said several federal courts had upheld searches based on " consent once removed , " and " because the unlawfulness of the officers ' conduct in this case was not clearly established , they are entitled to qualified immunity . " <p> One might think the Supreme Court 's duty is to " clearly establish " the law when lower courts are divided on a constitutional issue . However , the justices said it sometimes makes more sense  --  and certainly involves less work  --  to skip the constitutional question and preserve police immunity precisely because the law is uncertain . <p> Thus the court set aside a 2001 ruling in Saucier v. Katz that required judges to decide first any constitutional issue and then decide whether the law was " clearly established " at the time of the incident . Judges may still follow that two-step process , but they need not do so , the court said . <p> Former Solicitor General Paul Clement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law in flux . " In a constitutional question like this one , it is either yes or no . It 's either OK or not OK . And this means the answer will be pushed down the road indefinitely , " he says . " They took this case because there was a circuit split oh this question . And they decided to leave the circuit split unresolved . " <p> " THEY ARE CURBING THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE AND MAKING IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN CIVIL DAMAGES AT THE SAME TIME . " <p>  --  JEFFREY FISHE " THEY TOOK THIS CASE BECAUSE THERE WAS A CIRCUIT SPLIT ON THIS QUESTION . AND THEY DECIDED TO LEAVE THE CIRCUIT SPLIT UNRESOLVED . " <p>  --  PAUL CLEMENT By David G.
