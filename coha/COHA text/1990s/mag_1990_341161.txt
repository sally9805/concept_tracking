Just when Sri Lankans thought they had seen the end of it , war returned last week with blistering force . The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , a guerrilla group fighting for an independent ethnic Tamil homeland , attacked several police stations in Sri Lanka 's northeastern province . At least 300 people are believed to have died in the first days of fighting ; some reports said at least 100 of them were policemen executed by the rebels . The government dispatched an additional 4,200 troops to the region ( the total now : 15,000 ) and began using helicopter gunships , artillery and aerial bombardment to crush the guerrillas . <P> The fighting marks the resumption of an old battle : since 1983 , the Sri Lankan army and the Tigers have fought for control of the island 's northern and eastern regions , where the Tigers want to declare an independent state called Eelam . So far , the conflict has cost 11,000 lives . Since March , the Tigers and the government have been on peaceful , if wary , terms . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sri Lankan leaders of delaying elections , promised a fight if the government did not deliver . They were as good as their word .
