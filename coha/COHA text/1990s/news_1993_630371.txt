WHO IS PATRICK MOORE , and why do so many environmentalists hate him ? Moore has been denounced as an " ecoJudas " and a shill for the timber and nuclear industries by prominent Canadian green activist David Suzuki . He is " a turncoat who supports many of the things we oppose , " according to a Greenpeace spokesman . He routinely is lambasted for hiding secret ties to industries that use him like a marionette ; according to the green storyline , Moore is " paid by those industries to promote their products and mission ? ' He is not a real scientist , they claim , but a " liar " who " sold his soul " and for whom a special circle in Hell ought be reserved . The problem for environmentalists , however , is that Patrick Moore is one of them . And his tale raises serious questions about just exactly who strayed from the orthodoxy , who the real environmentalists are , and about the direction and aims of today 's environmental movement . The simple version goes like this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partly to oppose nuclear weapons testing . In just a short time it developed into the planet 's largest and most effective environmental organization . Moore broke with his compatriots in the mid-1980s and has emerged now as one of the foremost proponents of nuclear power , which drives his former mates crazy . It 's more complicated than that , of course , and the experience of Patrick Moore illustrates the peril that comes when an activist organization achieves political success . As a 24-year-old ecologist in 1971 , Moore hooked up with several scruffy environmental agitators in Vancouver , British Columbia . Vancouver was much like San Francisco at the time . Journalist Bob Hunter , one of Moore 's early colleagues , lovingly described it as having " the biggest concentration of tree-huggers , radicalized students , garbage-dump stoppers , s**t-disturbing unionists , freeway fighters , pot smokers and growers , aging Trotskyites , condo killers , farmland savers , fish preservationists , animal rights activists , back-tothe-landers , vegetarians , nudists , Buddhists , and anti-spraying , anti-pollution marchers and picketers in the country , per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and several others loaded into an 80-foot-long chartered halibut seiner called the Phyllis Cormack and set out from Vancouver . Referring to themselves as the Do n't Make a Wave Committee , they aimed for the Aleutian Alaskan island of Amchitka , where they hoped to disrupt the U.S. government 's upcoming underground nuclear test . The voyage was modeled after that of a solitary Quaker sailor in the 1950s who sailed from Honolulu to protest the hydrogen bomb tests at the Bikini Atoll . As the Phyllis Cormack left Vancouver , according to legend , one of the activists on board flashed the peace sign as a farewell . " Make it a green peace , " said another . Voil . They did n't get too far . Bad weather and the U.S. Navy thwarted their efforts . The explosion occurred as planned . But out of this failure came success . " That voyage , " according to Moore in a recent interview , " was the founding of Greenpeace . " A movement was born . " We were interested in science , " says Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys from the northwest grounded in science , worried about the effects of nuclear testing in the ocean . " Moore argues that many of the early Greenpeace activists were committed- initially- to pursuing sciencebased environmentalism . Moore was aboard a 1975 voyage that filmed a confrontation with a Soviet whaling fleet in the Pacific Ocean . Greenpeace footage of the Soviets harpooning a sperm whale was broadcast to national outrage in the United States , giving the organization and the " Save the Whales " campaign huge exposure . That helped spur the formation of Greenpeace chapters all over the U.S. , elevating Greenpeace from a band of misfits to an influential national organization . It was n't long before its reach extended to other nations as well . Under the direction of Moore and allies like Bob Hunter and David McTaggart , Greenpeace became a global behemoth with ambitions to rival the United Nations . By the mid-1980s , Greenpeace was solidly established as an international giant . But along the way , it lost founder Patrick Moore as an adherent . It had become , in his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce an antiintellectual ideology . This anti-intellectualism has become a hallmark of Greenpeace . " Moore noticed that the organization 's focus turned away from science and toward politics . Several of his colleagues were keen to initiate a campaign to ban chlorine worldwide . " I considered that a terrible idea , " he says . " Chlorine is an element , after all , on the periodic table . They called chlorine the ' Devil 's Element ' but I thought that adding chlorine to drinking water was one of the great advancements in the history of human civilization . " By the mid-1980s , after a number of tussles over how Greenpeace should be run and what its goals should be , Patrick Moore walked away from the organization he helped birth . Moore pursued causes he considered to be in line with efforts to promote sustainable development , among them aquaculture and forestry . To his former colleagues , Moore had gone over to the dark side . After all , people who cut down trees or pull fish from the seas must be evil . Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would necessarily incorporate ideas of sustainability into their business practices . His green colleagues called that view treason . On the first Greenpeace voyage back from Amchitka , Moore recalls , his colleague Bob Hunter coined the phrase " ecofascism " - approvingly . Hunter talked about the need to create a belief system that people could adhere to with blind faith . Moore traces the politicization of modern environmentalism back to that conversation with Hunter . " The political aspects he outlined there seemed totalitarian in nature . " It 's an apt description , given recent attempts by Greenpeace to erase Patrick Moore from its history . The official position of the organization today holds that Moore is not one of the original founders of the group ; he merely was around somewhat in the early days , but was not instrumental to the founding . Sadly for Greenpeace , that contradicts many of its earlier publications and pronouncements . Recently , Greenpeace has edited its website , erasing all mentions of Moore as one of the organization 's founders . GREENPEACE PARTICULARLY wants Moore to vanish these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports nuclear power . So they denounce and impugn him , calling into question his integrity . Moore is co-chair of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition ( CASEnergy ) , an organization promoting nuclear energy as a clean , safe , and dependable source of power . Not surprisingly , CASEnergy is financed by the nuclear industry , a fact about which nobody makes any secret . To the apparatchiks who denounce Moore , however , this is evidence he is a paid agent doing the bidding of nefarious overlords . Moore is content to let the arguments for and against nuclear power stand on their merits . He claims to have had a genuine conversion on the issue of nuclear power , believing it the only technology capable of supplying the vast amounts of power that can improve people 's lives while emitting no greenhouse gas emissions . For all the name-calling , the turncoat label is one that rankles . " I have n't turned in any of my positions or policies , " Moore says . " I still want to save the whales . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of nuclear power . But that is a recent conversion , based on what I think is a reasonable approach to the issues . " Still , he can live with the malice that is directed at him . " They hate me because I challenge their beliefs . And what they hold are beliefs , they are not opinions based in factual information . The reason I left was to move on to solution-oriented work . The people I left behind are not interested in solutions . They are interested in activism . " It 's a telling commentary on today 's environmental movement that it will expel one of its own for the crime of having sincere differences of opinion on how to save the planet . " What I see now is that they are in a state of decadence , like when an empire is crumbling , " he says . " They are so wrong on so many issues , from forestry to energy to genetics and agriculture . They are afraid of technology and its ability to improve human life . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
