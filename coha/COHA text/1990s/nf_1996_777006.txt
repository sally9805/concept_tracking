It Takes a Village // We can not live for ourselves alone . Our lives are connected by a thousand invisible threads , and along these sympathetic fibers , our actions run as causes and return to us as results . // HERMAN MELVILLE // Children are not rugged individualists . They depend on the adults they know and on thousands more who make decisions every day that affect their well-being . All of us , whether we acknowledge it or not , are responsible for deciding whether our children are raised in a nation that does n't just espouse family values but values families and children . // I have spent much of the past twenty-five years working to improve the lives of children . My work has taught me that they need more of our time , energy , and resources . But no experience brought home the lesson as vividly as becoming a mother myself . // When Chelsea Victoria Clinton lay in my arms for the first time , I was overwhelmed by the love and responsibility I felt for her . Despite all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had studied and advocated for , nothing had prepared me for the sheer miracle of her being . For the first time , I understood the words of the writer Elizabeth Stone : " Making the decision to have a child  --  it 's wondrous . It is to decide forever to have your heart go walking around outside your body . " // Bill and I had wanted to start a family immediately after we married , in 1975 , but we were not having much luck . In 1979 , we scheduled an appointment to visit a fertility clinic right after a long-awaited vacation . Lo and behold , I got pregnant during that vacation . ( I have often remarked to my husband that we might have had more children if we had taken more vacations ! ) // Bill was then governor of Arkansas , and my pregnancy was so widely discussed I thought the entire state might show up for the delivery . A lot of folks did , although , as far as I know , no one took pictures , or I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us helpful hints about how they had handled pregnancy and parenting . One of my favorites , from a burly ex-football player , was : " Think of a baby like a football , and hold it tight . " We read the advice books and asked endless questions of doctors , midwives , and nurses . // I persuaded Bill to attend Lamaze classes , where he and the other first-time fathers-to-be sat silently , arms crossed defensively over their chests , trying to look as if they were somewhere else . Our instructor asked how many of them had ever baby-sat or held an infant or , heaven forbid , bathed or changed one . A few mumbled , but hardly any hands went up . Then the teacher asked how many were scared to death of being responsible for a baby . Nervous laughter erupted , and many arms flagged in the air . After that you could n't keep them quiet ! // Despite all our preparation , when I went into labor , three weeks early , I was n't ready . Governor Bill Clinton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me pack . One of the items on the list was a small plastic bag to be filled with ice for me to suck during labor . As I hobbled to the car , I saw someone loading a huge sack of ice into the trunk , and I remembered what a woman reportedly said as she was helped over the railing of the Titanic : " I rang for ice , but this is ridiculous ! " // Chelsea 's birth transformed our lives , bringing us the greatest gift of joy  --  and humility  --  any parent could hope for . Like every child , Chelsea was her own person from the beginning . She arrived with a look of determination on her face that conveyed a focus and intensity we would come to know well . I prayed that I would be a good enough mother for her . // Every uncertainty and doubt I had was mixed with wonder and astonishment . I was beginning to discover for myself a timeless truth : Parenthood has the power to redefine every aspect of life  --  marriage , work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power and promise that come into our world show us our true selves  --  who we are , who we are not , who we wish we could be . // From the time I was a child myself , I loved being around children , looking into their faces or listening to the stories they told . Like many firstborn children , I learned to care for children by babysitting my two younger brothers . As a teenager , I baby-sat for other children too , and at thirteen I got my first " real " job , supervising children at a park on summer mornings . Through my church , I helped care for the children of migrant farmworkers while their parents labored in the fruit orchards and vegetable fields near my home . In college , I tutored children , and later , in law school , I got permission to add an extra year to the regular curriculum to study child development . I wondered about children I passed on the streets , and I worried about their journeys to adulthood . As a law professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as in my private practice , I saw first-hand the results of our failure to invest in children at the most critical stages of their lives . Too often , the best interests of children seemed not to be a priority on either individual or national agendas . The consequences are there for any of us to see : children 's potential lost to spirit-crushing poverty , children 's health lost to unaffordable care , children 's hearts lost in divorce and custody fights , children 's futures lost in an overburdened foster care system , children 's lives lost to abuse and violence , our society lost to itself as we fail our children . // And then I had a child of my own to love , wonder at , and worry about . Like most mothers , I am the designated worrier in our family . When Chelsea arrived , I went from worrying only five days a week to worrying on weekends too . My biggest challenge was to quell my longing to protect my daughter from everybody and everything that might hurt or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission impossible . Life is unpredictable  --  and a child 's impulse toward independence ultimately too powerful . // At four , my daughter refused my request to wear a sweater on what seemed to me an unusually chilly summer day . " I do n't feel cold , Mommy , " she said . " Maybe you do , but I have a different thermometer . " Chelsea speaks up when she thinks I have exceeded the acceptable maternal worry quotient . But , like many parents , I feel there is much to worry about when it comes to raising children in America today . // Everywhere we look , children are under assault : from violence and neglect , from the breakup of families , from the temptations of alcohol , tobacco , sex , and drug abuse , from greed , materialism , and spiritual emptiness . These problems are not new , but in our time they have skyrocketed . Against this bleak backdrop , the struggle to raise strong children and to support families , emotionally as well as practically , has become more fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my mind , my life . // Parents bear the first and primary responsibility for their sons and daughters  --  to feed them , to sing them to sleep , to teach them to ride a bike , to encourage their talents , to help them develop spiritual lives , to make countless daily decisions that determine whom they have the potential to become . I was blessed with a hardworking father who put his family first and a mother who was devoted to me and my two younger brothers . But I was also blessed with caring neighbors , attentive doctors , challenging public schools , safe streets , and an economy that supported my father 's job . Much of my family 's good fortune was beyond my parents ' direct control , but not beyond the control of other adults whose actions affected my life . // Children exist in the world as well as in the family . From the moment they are born , they depend on a host of other " grown-ups "  --  grandparents , neighbors , teachers , ministers , employers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly and indirectly . Adults police their streets , monitor the quality of their food , air , and water , produce the programs that appear on their televisions , run the businesses that employ their parents , and write the laws that protect them . Each of us plays a part in every child 's life : It takes a village to raise a child . // I chose that old African proverb to title this book because it offers a timeless reminder that children will thrive only if their families thrive and if the whole of society cares enough to provide for them . Soon after I began writing , a friend sent me the cartoon on this page , which I think about every time I hear someone say that children are not the responsibility of anyone outside their family . // The sage who first offered that proverb would undoubtedly be bewildered by what constitutes the modern village . In earlier times and places  --  and until recently in our own culture  --  the " village " meant an actual geographic place where individuals and families lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjures up a road sign that reads , " Hometown U.S.A. , pop . 5,340 , " followed by emblems of the local churches and civic clubs . // For most of us , though , the village does n't look like that anymore . In fact , it 's difficult to paint a picture of the modern village , so frantic and fragmented has much of our culture become . Extended families rarely live in the same town , let alone the same house . In many communities , crime and fear keep us behind locked doors . Where we used to chat with neighbors on stoops and porches , now we watch videos in our darkened living rooms . Instead of strolling down Main Street , we spend hours in automobiles and at anonymous shopping malls . We do n't join civic associations , churches , unions , political parties , or even bowling leagues the way we used to . // The horizons of the contemporary village extend well beyond the town line . From the moment we are born , we are exposed to vast numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , books , movies , computers , compact discs , cellular phones , and fax machines . Technology connects us to the impersonal global village it has created . // To many , this brave new world seems dehumanizing and inhospitable . It is not surprising , then , that there is a yearning for the " good old days " as a refuge from the problems of the present . But by turning away , we blind ourselves to the continuing , evolving presence of the village in our lives , and its critical importance for how we live together . The village can no longer be defined as a place on a map , or a list of people or organizations , but its essence remains the same : it is the network of values and relationships that support and affect our lives . // One of the honors of being First Lady is the opportunity I have to go out into the world and to see what individuals and communities are doing to help themselves and their children . I have had the privilege of talking with mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , PTAs , and church groups . From these many conversations , I know Americans everywhere are searching for  --  and often finding  --  new ways to support one another . // Around the country , for example , neighborhoods organize to close down crack houses and protect children as they walk to school . Businesses adopt family-friendly policies , open child care centers , offer parent education and marriage counseling . Churches , synagogues , and other religious institutions expand their traditional activities to include everything from aerobics classes and recovery groups to intergenerational day care centers . Parent-teacher associations , once lagging in attendance , find new life in some school districts as the baby boomer generation flocks to back-to-school nights and volunteers time in the classroom . Even our technology offers us new ways of coming together , through radio talk shows , E-mail , and the Internet. // The networks of relationships we form and depend on are our modern-day villages , but they reach well beyond city limits . Many of them necessarily involve the whole nation . They are the basis for our " civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way we work together for common purposes . Whether we harness their potential for the greater good or allow ourselves to drift into alienation and divisiveness depends on the choices we make now . // We can not move forward by looking to the past for easy solutions . Even if a golden age had existed , we could not simply graft it onto today 's busier , more impersonal and complicated world . Instead , our challenge is to arrive at a consensus of values and a common vision of what we can do today , individually and collectively , to build strong families and communities . Creating that consensus in a democracy depends on seriously considering other points of view , resisting the lure of extremist rhetoric , and balancing individual rights and freedoms with personal responsibility and mutual obligations . // The true test of the consensus we build is how well we care for our children . For a child , the village must remain personal . Talking to a baby while changing a diaper , playing airplane to entice a toddler to accept a spoonful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teenager , are tasks that can not be carried out in cyberspace . They require the presence of caring adults who are dedicated to children 's growth , nurturing , and well-being . What we do to participate in and support that network  --  from the way we care for our own children to the jobs we do , the causes we join , and the kinds of legislation we support  --  is mirrored every day in the experiences of America 's children . We can read our national character most plainly in the result . // How well we care for our own and other people 's children is n't only a question of morality ; our self-interest is at stake too . No family is immune to the influences of the larger society . No matter what my husband and I do to protect and prepare Chelsea , her future will be affected by how other children are being raised . I do n't want her to grow up in an America sharply divided by income , race , or religion . I 'd like to minimize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have enough love or discipline , opportunity or responsibility , as a child . I want her to believe , as her father and I did , that the American Dream is within reach of anyone willing to work hard and take responsibility . I want her to live in an America that is still strong and promising to its own citizens and lives up to its image throughout the world as a land of hope and opportunity . // I do not pretend to know how to nurture and protect every American child so that each one fully reaches his or her God-given potential . But I do know that we are not doing enough of what works . As of this writing , one in five children in America live in poverty ; ten million children do not have private or public health care coverage ; homicide and suicide kill almost seven thousand children every year ; one in four of all children are born to unmarried mothers , many of whom are children themselves ; and 135,000 children bring guns to school each day . Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preventable emotional problems . // Even though our national rhetoric proclaims that children are our most important resource , we squander these precious lives as though they do not matter . Children 's issues are seen as " soft , " the province of softhearted people ( usually women ) at the margins of the larger economic and social problems confronting our country . These issues are not soft . They are hard  --  the hardest issues we face . They are intimately connected to the very essence of who we are and who we will become . Whether or not you are a parent , what happens to America 's children affects your present and your future . // I write these words looking out through the windows in the White House at the city of Washington in all its beauty and squalor , promise and despair . In the shadow of great power , so many feel powerless . These contradictions color my feelings when I think about my own child and all our children . My worry for these children has increased , but remarkably , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more now than we did even a few years ago about how the human brain develops and what children need from their environments to develop character , empathy , and intelligence . When we put this knowledge into practice , the results are astonishing . Also , because when I read , travel , and talk with people around the world , it is increasingly clear to me that nearly every problem children face today has been solved somewhere , by someone . And finally , because I sense a new willingness on the part of many parents and citizens to turn down the decibel level on our political conflicts and start paying attention to what works . // There 's an old saying I love : You ca n't roll up your sleeves and get to work if you 're still wringing your hands . So if you , like me , are worrying about our kids ; if you , like me , have wondered how we can match our actions to our words , I 'd like to share with you some of the convictions I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a citizen but as a mother , daughter , sister , and wife  --  about what our children need from us and what we owe to them . // This book is not a memoir ; thankfully , that will have to wait . Nor is it a textbook or an encyclopedia ; it is not meant to be . It is a statement of my personal views , a reflection of my continuing meditation on children . Whether or not you agree with me , I hope it promotes an honest conversation among us. // This , then , is an invitation to a journey we can take together , as parents and as citizens of this country , united in the belief that children are what matter  --  more than the size of our bank accounts or the kinds of cars we drive . As Jackie Kennedy Onassis said , " If you bungle raising your children , I do n't think whatever else you do matters very much . " That goes for each of us , whether or not we are parents  --  and for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages that follow , we will consider some of the implications of what is known about the emotional and cognitive development of children . We will explore both big and bite-sized ideas we can put to work in our homes , schools , hospitals , businesses , media , churches , and governments to do a better job raising our own children , even when the odds seem weighted against us . Above all , we will learn ways to come together as a village to support and strengthen one another 's families and our own . Most of these lessons are simple , and some may seem self-evident . But it 's apparent that many of us have yet to learn them or to apply them in our families and communities . // These lessons come from family , friends , and neighbors ; from dedicated volunteers and professionals ; and from the many men and women whose passion is to see the promise of children fulfilled . I wish I had the space to introduce more than a few of the many people whose determination to help children has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the innovative ways in which our villages are working right now to improve the lives and futures of my child and all our children . // Some lessons come from countries I have had the opportunity to visit . The sight of baby carriages left unattended outside stores on the streets of Copenhagen said more to me about the safety of Danish babies than any research study could , and it made me long to know what the Danes and other cultures might teach us . As Eleanor Roosevelt said , " There is not one civilization , from the oldest to the very newest , from which we can not learn . " // Perhaps most important are the lessons I have learned from my daughter and her friends and from children all over the world . Children have many lessons to share with us  --  lessons about what they need , what makes them happy , how they view the world . If we listen , we 'll be able to hear them . This book is about the first and best lesson they have taught me : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ //
