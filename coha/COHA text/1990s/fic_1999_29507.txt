Chapter One July 1971 Malin Hatch was bored with summer . He and Johnny had spent the early part of the morning throwing rocks at the hornet 's nest in the old well-house . That had been fun . But now there was nothing else to do . It was just past eleven , but he 'd already eaten the two peanut-butter-and-banana sandwiches his mother had made him for lunch . Now he sat crosslegged on the floating dock in front of their house , looking out to sea , hoping to spot a battleship steaming over the horizon . Even a big oil tanker would do . Maybe it would head for one of the outer islands , run aground , and blow up . Now that would be something . His brother came out of the house and rattled down the wooden ramp leading to the dock . He was holding a piece of ice on his neck . " Got you good , " Malin said , secretly satisfied that he had escaped stinging and that his older , supposedly wiser , brother had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Johnny said through his last mouthful of sandwich . " Chicken . " " I got as close as you . " " Yeah , sure . All those bees could see was your skinny butt running away . " He snorted and winged the piece of ice into the water . " No , sir . I was right there . " Johnny plopped down beside him on the dock , dropping his satchel next to him . " We fixed those bees pretty good though , huh , Mal ? " he said , testing the fiery patch on his neck with one forefinger . " Sure did . " They fell silent . Malin looked out across the little cove toward the islands in the bay : Hermit Island , Wreck Island , Old Hump , Killick Stone . And far beyond , the blue outline of Ragged Island , appearing and disappearing in the stubborn mist that refused to lift even on this beautiful midsummer day . Beyond the islands , the open ocean was , as his father often said , as calm as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and watched the spreading ripples without interest . He almost regretted not going into town with his parents . At least it would be something to do . He wished he could be anywhere else in the world-Boston , New York-anywhere but Maine . " Ever been to New York , Johnny ? " he asked . Johnny nodded solemnly . " Once . Before you were born . " What a lie , Malin thought . As if Johnny would remember anything that had happened when he was less than two years old . But saying so out loud would be to risk a swift punch in the arm . Malin 's eye fell on the small outboard tied at the end of the dock . And he suddenly had an idea . A really good idea . " Let 's take it out , " he said , lowering his voice and nodding at the skiff . " You 're crazy , " Johnny said . " Dad would whip us good . " " Come on , " Malin said . " They 're having lunch at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back until three , maybe four . Who 's gon na know ? " " Just the whole town , that 's all , seeing us going out there . " " Nobody 's gon na be watching , " said Malin . Then , recklessly , he added , " Who 's chicken now ? " But Johnny did not seem to notice this liberty . His eyes were on the boat . " So where do you want to go that 's so great , anyway ? " he asked . Despite their solitude , Malin lowered his voice further . " Ragged Island . " Johnny turned toward him . " Dad 'll kill us , " he whispered . " He wo n't kill us if we find the treasure . " " There 's no treasure , " Johnny said scornfully , but without much conviction . " Anyway , it 's dangerous out there , with all those pits . " Malin knew enough about his brother to recognize the tone in his voice . Johnny was interested . Malin kept quiet , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abruptly , Johnny stood up and strode to the end of the dock . Malin waited , an anticipatory thrill coursing through him . When his brother returned , he was holding a life preserver in each hand . " When we land , we do n't go farther than the rocks along the shore . " Johnny 's voice was deliberately gruff , as if to remind Malin that simply having one good idea did n't alter their balance of power . " Understand ? " Malin nodded , holding the gunwale while Johnny tossed in his satchel and the life preservers . He wondered why they had n't thought of doing this before . Neither boy had ever been to Ragged Island . Malin did n't know any kids in the town of Stormhaven who ever had , either . It would make a great story to tell their friends . " You sit in the bow , " Johnny said , " and I 'll drive . " Malin watch Johnny fiddle with the shift lever , open the choke , pump the gas bulb , then yank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent . Johnny yanked again , then again . Ragged Island was six miles offshore , but Malin figured they could make it in a half hour on such a smooth sea . It was close to high tide , when the strong currents that swept the island dropped down to nothing before reversing . Johnny rested , his face red , and then turned again for a heroic yank . The engine sputtered into life . " Cast off ! " he shouted . As soon as the rope was uncleated , Johnny shoved the throttle all the way forward , and the tinny little eighteen-horsepower engine whined with exertion . The boat surged from the dock and headed out past Breed 's Point into the bay , wind and spray stinging Malin 's face delightfully . The boat sent back a creamy wake as it sliced through the ocean . There had been a massive storm the week before , but as usual it seemed to have settled the surface , and the water was glassy . Now Old Hump appeared to starboard , a low naked dome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaweed . As they buzzed through the channel , countless seagulls , drowsing one-legged on the rock , raised their heads and stared at the boat with bright yellow eyes . A single pair rose into the sky , then wheeled past , crying a lost cry . " This was a great idea , " Malin said . " Was n't it , Johnny ? " " Maybe , " Johnny said . " But if we get caught , it was your idea . " Even though their father owned Ragged Island , they had been forbidden to visit it for as long as he could remember . Their dad hated the place and never talked about it . Schoolyard legend held that countless people had been killed there digging for treasure ; that the place was cursed ; that it harbored ghosts . There were so many pits and shafts dug over the years that the island 's innards were completely rotten , ready to swallow the unwary visitor . He 'd even heard about the Curse Stone . It had been found in the Pit many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special room deep in the church basement , locked up tight because it was the work of the devil . Johnny once told him that when kids were really bad in Sunday School , they were shut up in the crypt with the Curse Stone . He felt another shiver of excitement . The island lay dead ahead now , wreathed in clinging tatters of mist . In winter , or on rainy days , the mist turned to a suffocating , pea-soup fog . On this bright summer day , it was more like translucent cotton candy . Johnny had tried to explain the local rip currents that caused it , but Malin had n't understood and was pretty sure Johnny did n't , either . The mist approached the boat 's prow and suddenly they were in a strange twilit world , the motor muffled . Almost unconsciously , Johnny slowed down . Then they were through the thickest of it and ahead Malin could see the Ragged Island ledges , their cruel seaweed-covered flanks softened by the mist . They brought the skiff through a low spot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the greenish tops of jagged underwater rocks , covered with waving seaweed ; the kind of rocks so feared by lobstermen at low tide or in heavy fog . But now the tide was high , and the little motorboat slid past effortlessly . After an argument about who was to get his feet wet , they grounded on the cobbled shore . Malin jumped out with the painter and pulled the boat up , feeling the water squish in his sneakers . Johnny stepped out onto dry land . " Pretty neat , " he said noncommittally , shouldering his satchel and looking inland . Just up from the stony beach , the sawgrass and chokecherry bushes began . The scene was lit by an eerie silver light , filtered through the ceiling of mist that still hung above their heads . A huge iron boiler , at least ten feet high , rose above the nearby grass , covered with massive rivets and rusted a deep orange . There was a split down one side , ragged and petalled . Its upper half was cloaked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Johnny said . " Bet it killed somebody , " Malin added with relish . " Bet it killed two people . " The cobbled beach ended at the seaward point of the island in ridges of wave-polished granite . Malin knew that fishermen passing through the Ragged Island Channel called these rocks the Whalebacks . He scrambled up the closest of the Whalebacks and stood high , trying to see over the bluffs into the island . " Get down ! " Johnny yelled . " Just what do you think you 're gon na see in all this mist ? Idiot . " " Takes one to know one- " Malin began , climbing down , and received a brotherly rap on the head for his troubles . " Stay behind me , " Johnny said . " We 'll circle the shore , then head back . " He walked quickly along the bottom of the bluffs , his tanned legs chocolate brown in the dim light . Malin followed , feeling aggrieved . It was his idea to come out here , but Johnny always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look ! " He bent down , picking up something long and white . " It 's a bone . " " No , it is n't , " Malin replied , still feeling annoyed . Coming to the island was his idea . He should have been the one to find it . " It is , too . And I bet it 's from a man . " Johnny swung the thing back and forth like a baseball bat . " It 's the leg bone off somebody who got killed trying to get the treasure . Or a pirate , maybe . I 'm gon na take it home and keep it under my bed . " Curiosity overcame Malin 's annoyance . " Let me see , " he said . Johnny handed him the bone . It felt surprisingly heavy and cold , and it smelled bad . " Yuck , " Malin said , hastily handing it back . " Maybe the skull 's around here somewhere , " Johnny replied . They poked among the rocks , finding nothing but a dead dogfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wrecked barge came into view , left from some long-forgotten salvage operation . It was grounded at the high-tide mark , twisted and pounded onto the rocks , buffeted by decades of storms . " Look at this , " said Johnny , interest rising in his voice . He scrambled out on the heaved , buckled deck . All around it lay rusted pieces of metal , pipes , busted gears , and nasty snarls of cable and wire . Malin began looking through the old junk , keeping an eye out for the gleam of a pirate doubloon . He figured that the pirate , Red Ned Ockham , was so rich he 'd probably dropped a whole lot of doubloons around the island . Red Ned , who 'd supposedly buried millions and millions in gold on the island , along with a jeweled weapon called St. Michael 's Sword , so powerful it could kill any man who even looked at it . They said Red Ned had once cut a man 's ears off and used them to make a bet in a dice game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really the man 's balls that Red Ned cut off , but Malin did n't believe her . Another time Red Ned got drunk and cut a man open , then threw him overboard and towed him by his guts until the sharks ate him . The kids at school had a lot of stories about Red Ned . Tiring of the barge , Johnny motioned for Malin to follow him along the rocks that lay scattered at the bottom of the bluffs on the windward side of the island . Above them , a high dirt embankment rose against the sky , roots of long-dead spruce trees poking horizontally from the soil like gnarled fingers . The top of the embankment was lost in the clinging mists . Some of the bluffs were caved in and collapsing , victims of the storms that slammed into the island every fall . It was chilly in the shadow of the bluffs , and Malin hurried on . Johnny , excited now by his finds , was bounding ahead , heedless of his own warnings , whooping and waving the bone . Malin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean as soon as she found it . Johnny stopped briefly to poke among stuff that had washed up on shore : old lobster buoys , busted-up traps , pieces of weathered planking . Then he moved toward a fresh gash farther up the bluffs . A bank had recently caved in , spilling dirt and boulders across the rocky shore . He leaped easily over the boulders , then disappeared from view . Malin moved more quickly now . He did n't like having Johnny out of sight . There was a stirring in the air : it had been a sunny day before they disappeared into the Ragged Island mist , but anything could be happening out there now . The breeze felt cold , as if weather was coming on , and the sea was beginning to break hard over the Ragged Island ledges . The tide would be close to turning . Maybe they 'd better start back . There was a sudden , sharp cry , and for a terrible moment Malin feared Johnny had hurt himself on the slippery rocks . But then the cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fallen rocks and around a bend in the shoreline . Before him , a huge granite boulder lay at a crazy angle , freshly dislodged from the bank by a recent storm . On its far side stood Johnny , pointing , a look of wide-eyed wonderment on his face . At first , Malin could n't say a word . The movement of the boulder had exposed the opening of a tunnel at the foot of the bank , with just enough room to squeeze behind . A clammy stream of stale air eddied from the tunnel mouth . " Cripes , " he said , running up the slope toward the embankment . " I found it ! " Johnny cried , breathless with excitement . " I bet you anything the treasure 's in there . Take a look , Malin ! " Malin turned . " It was my idea . " Johnny looked back with a smirk . " Maybe , " he said , unshouldering his satchel . " But I found it . And I brought the matches . " Malin leaned toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed his father when he said there never was any treasure on Ragged Island . But now , he was n't so sure . Was it possible his dad could be wrong ? Then he leaned back quickly , nose wrinkling against the stale smell of the tunnel . " What 's the matter ? " Johnny asked . " Afraid ? " " No , " said Malin in a small voice . The mouth of the tunnel looked very dark . " I 'm going first , " Johnny said . " You follow me . And you 'd better not get lost . " Tossing his prize bone away , he dropped to his knees and squirmed through the opening . Malin knelt also , then hesitated . The ground was hard and cold beneath him . But Johnny was already disappearing from sight , and Malin did n't want to be left on the lonely , fogbound shore . He squirmed through the opening after his brother . There was the snap of a match , and Malin sucked in his breath unconsciously as he rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof and walls held up by ancient timbers . Continues ...
