<p> A two-day walkout by up to 7,500 Kaiser Permanente nurses beginning today is merely the latest symptom of ill health for the medical giant that covers one in three insured people in Northern California . <p> Just as the country 's first and largest nonprofit health maintenance organization is poised to abandon outmoded buildings and pare costs , it is under attack from regulators , politicians , patients and even its own staff for substandard care . <p> Kaiser 's wild policy swings fuel critics ' doubts and suspicions . The most extreme example : After winning approval for a new hospital in Emeryville to replace its 13-story Oakland flagship , Kaiser announced last year that it would instead farm out patients to other hospitals . <p> " Aside from the vague overall plan they have to screw everybody , they do n't even have their act together to do it , " said Joan Bloom , a nurse practitioner and union leader at the Oakland hospital . <p> Kaiser Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Lawrence dismisses such comments as strike rhetoric . <p> " Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresponsible of a decision as I have seen in 35 years of medicine , " Lawrence said . " They are endangering our patients . " <p> A longer strike  --  a possibility later in the year  --  would force Kaiser to speed up plans to close some of its hospitals , he added . <p> Often derided as the health care equivalent of a fast-food chain , Kaiser nevertheless enjoys a high degree of patient satisfaction among 5.1 million Californians and 1.8 million people in 17 other states and the District of Columbia , according to industry and in-house surveys . <p> Serious grievances do arise , such as the case of a Hayward patient who died of lung cancer in 1991 before his malpractice claim could be heard . The state Supreme Court ruled in June that his family could sue Kaiser for delaying arbitration . <p> But most complaints center on access to routine care . Patients , especially those who do not learn to " work " the system , often end up with unfamiliar doctors or long waits for nonurgent appointments . <p> Lately , trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised questions beyond Kaiser 's maddening phone system and occasionally gruff clerks . <p> The deaths of four patients transferred by ambulance from the minimal emergency room in Richmond brought Kaiser under state and federal scrutiny this spring . A fifth man died after walking out of the emergency room , frustrated with the delay in finding him an intensive-care bed in another hospital . <p> No one knows if those critically ill patients , including a heart transplant candidate , would have survived if they had received care more quickly . Licensing investigators also criticized the emergency room for sending 10 patients elsewhere without providing an ambulance . Those patients included a man with appendicitis , an infant with breathing trouble and seven women in labor . <p> The 10th patient , a 71-year-old man , was given two doses of the narcotic painkiller Demerol and sent to the Oakland emergency room without any record of whether he had someone to drive him or whether he was told he should n't drive . <p> The 103-page licensing report lists hundreds of more mundane yet potentially dangerous deficiencies . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medicine it contained . Employees said the door latch had been broken for " weeks " or " months . " <p> Facing what would have been the catastrophic loss of its ability to treat Medicare patients , Kaiser admitted it had made mistakes and corrected life-threatening problems by the July 1 deadline , earning praise from regulators . <p> A list of deficiencies found during separate investigations at Kaiser 's Walnut Creek and Martinez hospitals will be completed within days , said Gil Martinez of the state health department 's licensing and certification division . <p> Kaiser has also come under fire in Texas , where the HMO paid $ 1 million in April to settle state accusations that it refused to pay for emergency treatment even when Kaiser advice nurses directed patients to an emergency room . <p> Kaiser 's CEO Lawrence called the fine " grossly out of line " and said the problems were exaggerated . <p> Some of Kaiser 's difficulties in California stem from a miscalculated $ 3.6 billion building boom launched just as hospitalization plummeted because of less-invasive surgical techniques and shorter stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baldwin Park in Southern California may never open . The 50-bed Richmond hospital opened in 1995 but averaged only six to 12 patients per day when it closed in April . <p> Bernard Tyson , Kaiser 's vice president for East Bay operations , said he hopes to announce a deal within 60 days to reopen the hospital with another provider . Without a partner , the hospital will remain closed and the emergency room will become an urgent-care center . <p> The Martinez hospital also lacks a sufficient patient base , but political pressure delayed plans to close it . The Oakland hospital is busy , but it will not meet seismic standards that take effect in 2008 . <p> Closing hospitals will mean longer travel times for some patients and their families . But the bulk of the HMO 's prevention-oriented care takes place at outpatient clinics , which will not be affected . <p> Patients visited Oakland clinics 1 million times last year , but were admitted to the hospital only 13,000 times . <p> Kaiser 's closure plans bewilder some patients . <p> " I heard they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Randle James , a diabetic who had not heard of the plan to contract with other hospitals . <p> James , a 56-year-old former machinist who joined Kaiser in 1960 , praised the affordable care but echoed a common complaint : Last week , he waited 40 minutes at the hospital lab to have blood drawn  --  a two-minute procedure . <p> Despite advertisements emphasizing doctors ' personal interaction with patients , Kaiser remains saddled with a reputation as a sometimes impersonal bureaucracy . <p> Tashiana Scott-Cochran , a 19- year-old cerebral palsy patient from Richmond , has seen the same doctor since she was in the second grade . He nevertheless mangled her name during her last visit . <p> " He called me the wrong name , as if that was all right . If I had a choice , I would n't be here , " said Scott-Cochran , a college sophomore dependent on her parents ' insurance coverage . <p> Politicians from city councils to Congress have dragged Kaiser 's closure plans under the microscope because of its emergency- room problems . <p> " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , church , grocery store or hospital , but that 's not realistic , " U.S. Representative George Miller , D-Martinez , told Kaiser and other health care executives at a meeting last week in his office . " But we do need to make sure that what 's left fits the community . " <p> Kaiser claims that health care trends compel it to cut costs by eliminating unnecessary hospitals . Nurses , who have worked without a contract since January 1 , say Kaiser is leading the charge to reduce hospitalization . <p> " It 's very good PR  --  it looks like they 're victims of their own plan , " said Rose Ann DeMoro , executive director of the California Nurses Association . " The reason there are excess beds is because they are denying them to patients who need them . " <p> Negotiators for nurses and management met Saturday for the first time since April but made little progress . This week , Kaiser hospitals and clinics began diverting patients to other facilities and rescheduling appointments . <p> The nurses ' insistence on putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution . The nurses association has refused to join other unions on a quality-improvement committee , saying the committee lacks authority . <p> Lawrence said he " absolutely " would not write the nurses ' patient-care demands into their contract . <p> WHAT 'S AILING KAISER <p> . <p> Kaiser Permanente 's continuing headaches include : <p> . <p> * A federal investigation into delayed and substandard care at its Walnut Creek and Martinez hospitals . One man bled to death after a cap on an intravenous line leaked while an alarm was turned off . <p> * Possible fines of up to $ 700,000 for unsafely transferring patients from the Richmond hospital . <p> * An unusual follow-up inspection after last year 's audit by the state Department of Corporations , which regulates health maintenance organizations and normally only inspects hospitals once every three years . <p> * Delayed plans for closing its flagship hospital in Oakland . <p> * Inability to find a partner to reopen its Richmond hospital . Without more patients , Kaiser will permanently close the hospital and convert the emergency room to an urgent-care center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baldwin Park that never opened . <p> * Community and employee opposition to plans for closing its Martinez hospital . <p> * A barrage of proposed legislation inspired by Kaiser 's troubles . One congressional bill , whose sponsors include five Bay Area Democrats , would make it easier for patients to sue if they are denied care to control costs . <p> * One lawsuit for delaying arbitration in the case of a patient who died before his case could be heard , and another for overbooking appointments . <p> KAISER NURSES ON STRIKE TODAY <p> . <p> Kaiser Permanente will rely on doctors , supervisors and nonstriking workers to keep its clinics and hospitals open today and tomorrow . Patients should call to confirm routine appointments . Patients with same-day or urgent-care appointments should go directly to the department where the appointment is scheduled .
