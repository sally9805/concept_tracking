<p> Pepsi-Cola and its black-owned local franchisee had planned the most politically immaculate of reentries into the new South Africa . Instead , they are embroiled in a nasty dispute with black job-seekers . <p> Nine years after it stopped doing business in South Africa because of its opposition to apartheid , Pepsi is back . But every day for the past two months , hundreds  --  sometimes thousands  --  of unemployed blacks have lined up outside the new Pepsi plant on the outskirts of Johannesburg , demanding to be hired for $ 2.60-an-hour factory jobs that long have been filled . <p> When the first Pepsi trucks tried to roll recently , the demonstrators blocked them for several hours until police intervened . Twice in the past six weeks , the job-seekers have stormed the plant and damaged offices . Daily , they harass employees going in and out . The protesters , in turn , say several of their number have been injured  --  and one killed  --  when police broke up demonstrations . <p> In many ways , Pepsi 's troubles appear to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do help illustrate , however , how the culture of protest that became entrenched over decades and helped to bring down white-minority rule is now affecting business development , military integration and political empowerment among the country 's black majority . <p> New Age Beverages , the Pepsi franchisee here , is owned by a dazzling array of African American celebrities , including singer Whitney Houston ( who just concluded a Pepsi-sponsored concert tour in South Africa ) , basketball star Shaquille O'Neal , actor Danny Glover , attorney Johnnie Cochran and Earl Graves , a publisher and Washington Pepsi distributor . <p> Its chief executive , Khehla Mthembu , is a former black activist who once was imprisoned on Robben Island for anti-apartheid activities . The vast majority of New Age 's 150 employees are black . It is promoting black entrepreneurship by training and financing a network of independent black driver-distributors . And it has been marketing its product as the soft drink for the new South Africa . <p> As a result of all this , company officials say , they are baffled by the demonstrations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived in the new South Africa on the broad shoulders of democracy . <p> " I do think there is a sense of entitlement now in this society , which is understandable , given the great poverty and unemployment  --  and the great expectations created by the election , " said Monawabisi Fandeso , president of New Age Beverages , referring to the April ballot that made Nelson Mandela South Africa 's first black president . <p> " But it 's unfortunate it has manifested itself against us , because we 're in the forefront of black economic empowerment . It 's also unfortunate because if you get too many incidents like this , it could have a chilling effect on others who are thinking of investing in the new South Africa . " <p> That concern seems far from the minds of the protesters . " Pepsi-Cola is a company that is reinvesting in South Africa , and so it must employ us , " said Machipu Matbejoane , a spokesman for the protesters . He said the group has no political or union affiliation ; it came together spontaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The job-seekers became aggrieved , he said , when rumors spread that those who did get jobs at the plant were friends or relatives of the executives . <p> Even though the company insists that all 150 jobs were filled long before the protesters arrived , job-seekers continue to camp for eight hours a day outside the main gate . " I have not worked in two years , " said Willie Matau , an unemployed laborer who borrows a dollar a day from family and friends for transportation from his home in Katlehong . " There are no jobs anywhere . It 's better to come here than to just stand around at home . " <p> Jabulane Mkhize , 23 , said he has never had a job and realizes it is a long shot to get one here . " But one must never give up hope , " he said . <p> The official unemployment rate among blacks here is 50 percent , and people are desperate for work . Recently , when the new government announced it would be filling 11,000 low-level civil service slots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the two months since the protest began , civic and peace groups and local government officials have tried to mediate , so far unsuccessfully . The U.S. Embassy has noted its concern to the government but has not become directly involved . <p> Last month the company offered to hire protesters on a lottery basis to fill any job vacancies , but when four slots were filled that way , Fandeso said , the move triggered violence and attracted hundreds more demonstrators . " For some reason , the people outside continue to believe there are jobs to be had , " he said . <p> " Perhaps we have become a target because Pepsi is a famous name , " said Graves , who put together the high-profile group of U.S. investors . He said he has no regrets about his investment here and sees the protest as an unfortunate but temporary blip . " It is awesome to be in South Africa at this time , " he said . <p> Although Pepsi 's problem is unusual , the teething problems of post-apartheid South Africa are widespread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society where protest is the rule rather than the exception . <p> In recent weeks , thousands of former anti-apartheid guerrilla soldiers have gone AWOL from the new South African army into which they were to have been integrated , because they do not like the conditions . Millions of blacks who had refused to pay rent to apartheid-era local governments continue to withhold it under a democracy , despite Mandela 's insistence that they start paying . Squatters continue to invade land set aside for low income housing , delaying the construction of homes . Conventional labor strikes  --  some led by unions , others by wildcatters  --  are an everyday fact of life . <p> This turbulence does not yet add up to a crisis . South Africa is a far more tranquil place a half-year after its great political transformation than it was a half-year before  --  and more calm than doomsayers thought it ever could become . <p> But expectations for a better life are high , while the new government  --  still wildly popular  --  has yet to start delivering the houses , jobs , land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandela 's government has begun to take a tougher line against the protesters . On Nov. 7 , it dismissed 2,200 of the AWOL soldiers . It also has made clear that new low-cost housing , when it eventually is built , will go up first in communities that show a willingness to pay their rents . <p> Meanwhile , business goes on . While there has not been the post-apartheid boom of job-creating foreign investments that many here had hoped for , there has been a steady trickle . <p> One of the most-watched returning companies is Pepsi . It always ran a distant second in the marketplace here to Coca-Cola , so when it pulled out in 1985 , it was as much a function of economics as of politics . Coke left in 1986 in response to the international sanctions , but it sold its brand name and bottling interest to a local company , National Beverage Services , that has prospered . <p> In South Africa , Coke now has 75 percent of the soft-drink market . When Whitney Houston sang before 75,000 people at a Pepsi-sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks in the stadium were Cokes . It has the stadium franchise . <p> In June , Coca-Cola reinvested in South Africa and promptly announced a new joint bottling venture with the Kunene family , prominent black South African entrepreneurs . Coke says it too is dedicated to black empowerment  --  and it notes that the livelihoods of 100,000 black South Africans are tied to its products . <p> Some Pepsi executives say privately that they suspect the protests are inspired by their competitors at Coke  --  an allegation that both Coke and the protesters deny . <p> " We would n't wish the problems at Pepsi on anyone , " said Denise Green , a Coke spokeswoman . " We plan to beat them in the marketplace . "
