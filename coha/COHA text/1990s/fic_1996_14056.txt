How did some slip of a girlyboy from communist East Berlin become the internationally ignored song stylist barely standing before you ? That 's what I want to talk about tonight . I 'm not here to talk about calamity or scandal . I 'm not here to talk about my relationship with a certain well-known rock icon , Tommy Gnosis .

And when I think of all the people I have come upon in my travels , I have to think about the people who have come upon me.

Who left when I was barely old enough to speak my first words : " Daddy , when I grow up , I 'll kill you " ? Could it have been my East German mother ? ( projection of a mom and little boy not holding hands ) No , when she touched me it was usually by accident . Reaching for the beans at the table or something . One day , we were watching Jesus Christ Superstar on American Forces Television . ( a crude drawing of the face of Jesus on a T.V. screen ) I turned to Mother : ( HEDWIG as child : ) " Jesus said the darndest things . " She slapped me .

Suddenly He 's Vladimir Lenin on the T.V. ) We happened to be living on the East side and mother was given a job teaching sculpture to limbless children . Socialism , God rest its soul ! ( She repairs to a booth with a table . ) Most of my time was spent listening to American Forces Radio . Our apartment was so small that mother made me play it in the oven .

" And I would reply from the kitchen , " Well , I guess that 's me too . " We would wash our feet and brush our teeth and lay down on the narrow pallet that we had shared since Daddy left . ( a drawing of two figures lying uncomfortably back to back ) like two pieces of a puzzle that do n't quite fit but are jammed together and left on a table by ( railing at the heavens ) some dangerous shut-in with too much time on his hands !

THE ORIGIN OF LOVE ( Crude drawings illustrate the story . ) When the earth was still flat , And clouds made of fire , And mountains stretched up to the sky , Sometimes higher , Folks roamed the earthLike big rolling kegs.They had two sets of arms.They had two sets of legs.They had two faces peeringOut of one giant headSo they could watch all around themAs they talked ; while they read.And they never knew nothing of love.It was before the origin of love . The origin of love And there were three sexes then , One that looked like two menGlued up back to back , Called the children of the sun.And similar in shape and girthWere the children of the earth.They looked like two girlsRolled up in one . And the children of the moonLooked like a fork shoved on a spoon.They were part sun , part earth , Part daughter , part son . The origin of love . Now the gods grew quite scaredOf our strength and defianceAnd Thor said , " I 'm gon na kill them allWith my hammer , Like I killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , You better let meUse my lightning , like scissors , Like I cut the legs off the whalesAnd dinosaurs into lizards . " Then he grabbed up some boltsAnd he let out a laugh , Said , " I 'll split them right down the middle.Gonna cut them right up in half . " And then storm clouds gathered aboveInto great balls of fire And then fire shot downFrom the sky in boltsLike shining blades Of a knife.And it rippedRight through the fleshOf the children of the sunAnd the moonAnd the earth.And some Indian godSewed the wound up into a hole , Pulled it round to our bellyTo remind us of the price we pay.And Osiris and the gods of the NileGathered up a big stormTo blow a hurricane , To scatter us away , In a flood of wind and rain , And a sea of tidal waves , To wash us all away , And if we do n't behaveThey 'll cut us down againAnd we 'll be hopping around on one footAnd looking through one eye . Last time I saw youWe had just split in two.You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way so familiar , But I could not recognize , Cause you had blood on your face ; I had blood in my eyes.But I could swear by your expressionThat the pain down in your soulWas the same as the one down in mine.That 's the pain , Cuts a straight lineDown through the heart ; We called it love.So we wrapped our arms around each other , Trying to shove ourselves back together.We were making love , Making love.It was a cold dark evening , Such a long time ago , When by the mighty hand of Jove , It was a sad storyHow we becameLonely two-legged creatures , It 's the story ofThe origin of love.That 's the origin of love . After mother finished , she began to snore . But I had to go somewhere I could think . I crept into the kitchen and put my head in the oven.It is clear that I must find my other half . But is it a he or a she ? Is it Daddy ? He went away . Or Mother ? I was suddenly afraid to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Identical to me ? Or somehow complementary ? Does my other half have what I do n't ? Did he get the looks , the luck , the love ? Were we really separated forcibly or did he just run off with the good stuff ? Or did I ? Will this person embarrass me ? And what about sex ? Is that how we put ourselves back together again ? Is that what Daddy was trying to do ? Or can two people actually become one again ? And if we 're driving on the Autobahn when it happens , can we still use the diamond lane ? Practical questions of wholeness . Completion . Think of it . I thought of it . I thought of the power .

They kick in on the high notes . Now , I want to you to be serious . Just the other day I was telling Yitzhak how nervous I was about tonight ( YITZHAK has removed a flowing wig from a shelf and is lovingly combing it . ) ( HEDWIG smooths her denim dress . ) Would I still be able to fit into that old Sergio Valente ? There was no time to diet , so I had my heart removed . Suddenly , I was a perfect size six ! ( She hears YITZHAK singing softly and catches him swishing about with the hairpiece on his head . ) WAS MACHST DU DA VERDAMMT NOCH MAL ? ( A redfaced YITZHAK whips the wig back onto the prop shelf . ) HEDWIG I 'm sorry you had to see that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to be a model . A foot model , maybe .

( HEDWIG looks back at YITZHAK . YITZHAK , as if searching for the source of the voice , opens the emergency door . The Tommy Gnosis concert pours in again . ) TOMMY GNOSIS ( off )  --  I realized there was only one person who had ever really been there for me in my life . And that person was me . The accident was a cry for help . I was yelling " Help ! " to me  --  ( HEDWIG slams the door . ) HEDWIG Well , what about me ? Without me he never would 've swerved into that oncoming short bus and got all that attention ! Let me just take a second here , against the advice of my lawyers , Jacoby , Meyers and Lee Bailey . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're talking about the tony , newly renovated , meat-packing district . You 've heard of SoHo ? NoHo ? This is MePa . I was standing there on 14th Street , the very boulevard of MePa , when a limo pulled up . I stepped into it , naturally mistaking it for my own . In the limo sat Tommy Gnosis . We were both astonished . It had been years . So we dropped the driver off and drove up and down the island , doing drugs and catching up . We talked about the disappointing sales of his second album  --  the one he wrote without me . He spoke of his loneliness . I reminded him of happier days . I just could n't keep my mouth shut and , well , you know the rest . So you can imagine , when the story broke , Tommy 's people offered me a small fortune to keep all this to myself . As if I 'd accept their filthy lucre . As if selling the story of someone else 's pain was my only means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my new fragrance : " Atrocity . " By Hedwig. ( projection of Atrocity logo ) It 's a fragrance for a man or a woman . Or a freak . I digress . One day in the late mid eighties I was in my early late twenties . I had just been dismissed from university after delivering a brilliant lecture on the aggressive influence of German philosophy on rock and roll entitled : " You , Kant , Always Get What You Want " . At 26 , my academic career was over , I had never kissed a boy and I was still sleeping with mom . The search for my other half on this side of the Wall had proved futile . Might he be found on the other ? ( projection of drawn figures separated by wall ) But how to get over ? People died trying . Such were the thoughts flooding my tiny head on the day that I was sunning myself in an old bomb crater I had discovered near the Wall . I am naked , face down , on a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new McDonalds has just opened on the other side . My God , I deserve a break today . All I ever get is the unhappy meal . The sun is hot , but I feel a sudden chill . I look over my shoulder . A head-shaped shadow is resting on the pillow of my ass . ( LUTHER : ) " Girl , I sure do n't mean to annoy you . My name is Corporal Luther Robinson . " I turn my body to face him . ( HEDWIG : ) " My name is Hansel . " Luther is silent for a moment as he stares at my little bishop in a turtleneck . ( LUTHER : ) " Hansel . Well . You must like candy . " ( HEDWIG : ) " I like Gummi Baerchen . " Out of his pocket comes a strange packet that says " Gummy Bears " on it . Gummy Bears ? ( projection of bear ) I select a single clear bear . It is the biggest one I 've ever seen . The taste is completely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is much sweeter than a Gummi Bear and softer , too . Its little gummy body stretches on the rack of my molars . Wow , I feel so optimistic . What is that flavor ? He pours me a handful , his eyes heavy with an unfamiliar desire . Could it be a desire to please ? Me ? I suddenly recognize the flavor in my mouth . It 's the taste of power . Not bad . ( LUTHER : ) " Damn , Hansel , I ca n't believe you 're not a girl , you 're so fine . Why do n't you take the whole bag ? " He searches my face for news of his fate . His expression is echoed in scores of tiny faces pressing against clear plastic . Panting faces of every imaginable color , creed and non-Aryan origin fogging up the bag like the windows of a Polish bathhouse . It 's only a shower . Absolute power . ( slaps herself ) I push Luther away and stumble naked through the ruins , back towards blander , less complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnage.Next day , Hansel follows the trail back. and lying on my slab are three Milky Ways , a roll of Necco Wafers , some Pop Rocks , and a Giant-Size Sugar Daddy named Luther .

The concert barges in again. ) p. 10 TOMMY GNOSIS  --  me , the real me , the me I used to be  --  ( She closes the door quickly . ) HEDWIG After dessert , Luther produces a ring , an application for American citizenship , and a wig .

Perhaps it was his disdain for authority , his struggle with organized religion . One day , I walked in on him punishing the bishop.He was in the bath with the door wide open , clearly waiting for me . I reached down , finished His Grace off , and dropped a flyer on the bathmat . " By the way , Tommy , I am performing a short set tonight at Dr. Espresso 's Seattle-Style Coffee Enema Bar . Maybe I 'll see you there . " I had recently returned to my first love , music . I had tried singing once back in Berlin . They threw tomatoes . After the show I had a nice salad . But newly motivated , I bought a cheap electric piano . ( piano phrase from some cheesy hit ) That song was built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of Korean sargeants ' wives who churned out a mean rhythm section . ( bad drums ) Somehow we became quite a draw singing the hits of the day under the name The Angry Inch . ( projection of Dr. Espresso 's logo ) That night the audience was small but hostile . ( lounge version of Smells Like Teen Spirit winds down ) ( to audience ) Thank you . Both of you . That song was by Kurt Cobain . That kid 's got a future , huh ? And how ' bout Kwang-yi on guitar ? Give it up ! Kwang-yi ! ( bad guitar solo ) Give it up , Kwang . Looks like we have a celebrity here tonight over by the Sweet &amp; Low . Ladies and gentlemen , little Tommy Speck , the General 's son ! ( BAND claps half-heartedly . ) That 's more than I got , honey . He 's embarrassed . ( piano intro starts ) Well , I 'm a little nervous myself . This is the first song I 've ever written . And it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Phil Collins ' people . But then are n't we all ? WICKED LITTLE TOWN You know , the sun is in your eyes And hurricanes and rainsand black and cloudy skies . You 're running up and down that hill.You turn it on and off at will.There 's nothing here to thrillor bring you down.And if you 've got no other choiceYou know you can follow my voicethrough the dark turns and noiseof this wicked little town . Oh Lady , luck has led you hereand they 're so twisted upthey 'll twist you up . I fear the pious , hateful and devout , your 're turning tricks til you 're turned out , the wind so cold it burns , you 're burning out and blowing round.And if you 've got no other choiceyou know you can follow my voicethrough the dark turns and noiseof this wicked little town . The fates are vicious and they 're cruel.You learn too late you 've used two wisheslike a fool and then you 're someone you are not , and Junction City ai n't the spot , remember Mrs. Lotand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you can follow my voicethrough the dark turns and noiseof this wicked little town . ( She blows a kiss to TOMMY on the final chord . She dabs her face with a towel and looks down at it . She holds it up . ) The shroud of Hedwig , ladies and gentlemen.The next day , I was putting the little Speck baby to bed when Tommy appeared with a very expensive-looking electric guitar . ( TOMMY : ) " Your show that song my dad gave me this guitar to apologize for being a pathetic little dictator . You want to come up to my room ? " We went up to the attic and he sang me songs . " Classics , " I was informed . The bands were new to me : Boston , Kansas , America , Europe , Asia . I put my hand on his strings . " Travel exhausts me . " ( TOMMY : ) " Where are you from , Hedwig ? " I told him my story . His face might have been a Yes album cover it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you accepted Jesus Christ , the Son of God , as your personal savior ? " I told him I was aware of Our Lord . Loved His work . ( TOMMY : ) " You know , what He saved us from was His fucking father . I mean what kind of God creates Adam in His image , pulls Eve out of him to keep him company , and then tells them not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge ? That was so micromanaging . So was Adam . But Eve . Eve just wanted to know shit . She took a bite of the apple and found out what was good and what was evil . And she gave it to Adam so he would know . Because they were in love . And that was good they now knew . Hedwig , will you give me the apple ? " The words spilling from those lips . And his eyes . His irises were clear cylinders of surprising depth . And emptiness . Only a few puddles of bluish pain sloshed around inside . Same blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following . ) At the time , Tommy 's performance options were limited to the occasional guitar mass . I initiated a six month curriculum of rock history , lyrics , grooming and vocal training  --  my patented oven technique . For his graduation , I gave him his name , Tommy Gnosis ( The word is projected. ) , the Greek word for knowledge . We collaborated . Songs exploded out of us . He started singing backup for me at Dr. Espresso 's . Teenage girls started showing up . I added a few duets . Standing-room only . Then , the Sizzler called . In three months , we were outgrossing monster trucks in Wichita . With that kind of money coming in , I was able to give up all my jobs and devote myself entirely to our career . We were very happy.One day , I am curled up in the trailer with my usual late-afternoon constitutional of grain alcohol and Brita . I like to be good to myself . Suddenly , Tommy is at the door in tears . ( HEDWIG : ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ) " My dad and my mom and my parents . " I hold him as I never had been held . But as usual he squirms , slides behind me and clutches my spine to his chest . I am suddenly very much aware that we have n't kissed in all the months we 've been together . In fact , he has maintained a near-perfect ignorance of the front of me . Perhaps because of his preference for over-the-shoulder love . ( projection of HEDWIG 's and TOMMY 's figures in a " spooning " position ) ( HEDWIG : ) " Honey , why do n't you work on that new song while I finish shaving your eyebrows ? " ( guitar ) ( TOMMY sings : ) " Look what you done ( The chord is wrong . ) Shit . " Another song blows in from the trailer next door . p. 15 YITZHAK ( sings I Will Always Love You a la Whitney Houston ) and lllllllll HEDWIG This song has been playing on a loop for three days . YITZHAK will always love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at me through new lenses , one blue and one pink . ( TOMMY : ) " What do you think ? Does love last forever ? " ( HEDWIG : ) " No , but this song does . " ( TOMMY : ) " Do not knock a multiplatinum single . I wish I could hit those notes . " ( HEDWIG : ) " Just move your lips and I 'll sing them for you , honey . From a shadowy corner of the stage . Like Mick Jagger 's backup singer . " We laugh at the professional reference . I return to his brows . YITZHAK ( singing ) But most of all I wish you love HEDWIG ( HEDWIG : ) " Seriously , Tom , yes . I believe love is immortal . " ( guitar chords ) ( TOMMY sings : ) " Look what you done ( bad chord ) goddammit ! How is it immortal ? " ( HEDWIG : ) " Well , perhaps because love creates something that was not there before . " ( TOMMY : ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Yes , but not only . " ( TOMMY : ) " What , like recreation ? " He grabs my ass and he laughs . I do n't . ( HEDWIG : ) " Sometimes just creation . Do n't move . " I paint a bold silver cross on his forehead . ( guitar chords ) ( HEDWIG : ) " Honey , have you thought of a B flat after that B ? " ( chords ) ( TOMMY sings : ) " Look what you done  --  " ( The B flat works gloriously . TOMMY looks up at her in awe. ) p. 16 YITZHAK ( modulating ) And llllll ! ( YITZHAK continues to sing through the following . ) HEDWIG Tommy slowly rises and draws the curtains that are attached at the top and the bottom . He reachs out his hand . I take it . I notice how well his " Harlem Spice " nail color complements my own " Dusty Menses " . He spins me into his arms and rubs his pelvis into the small of my back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . You made me whole . Before I met you , I was the song . But now I 'm the video . " ( HEDWIG sings : ) " Look what I 've done . I made you whole . You know that you were just a ham . Then came me , the Dole pineapple rings . " He laughs and I am filled with an ancient clarity . He 's the one . ( ORIGIN OF LOVE chords . A projection appears of two complementary faces  --  one male , one female  --  familiar from The Origin of Love sequence . ) No blood in my eyes , no blood on his face . He 's the one . The one who was taken . The one who left . The twin born by fission . He 'll die in fusion , our fusion , cold fusion , unlimited power , unlimited knowledge , the secrets he must hold , the memories that we shared but are now forgotton , the words to complete the sentence that I began , " I am ! " My eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Hedwig . Oh , God . When Eve was still inside Adam , they were in Paradise . When she was separated from him , that 's when Paradise was lost . So when she enters him again , Paradise will be regained ! " ( HEDWIG : ) " That 's right , however you want it , honey , just kiss me while we do it . " I wrench my body around to face him and thrust his hand between my legs  --  ( TOMMY : ) " What is that ? " ( pause ) ( HEDWIG : ) " That 's what I have to work with . " ( pause ) ( TOMMY : ) " My mom is probably wondering where I  --  " ( HEDWIG : ) " Sissy . Nancy , girly , lispyboy . What are you afraid of ? " ( TOMMY : ) " I love you . " ( HEDWIG : ) " Then love the front of me . " He runs out the back door . ( Guitar intro .

She smashes them on her body and crumples to the floor . The BAND glories in her collapse . The music crescendoes , disintegrates and crossfades to stadium-sized cheers . HEDWIG 's body lies motionless . The piano intro to WICKED LITTLE TOWN begins as the glowing word GNOSIS fills the upstage wall. ) p. 18 TOMMY GNOSIS ( off ) Before I go , I 'd like to sing a song that someone wrote for me a long time ago . I do n't know where she is tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me . ( HEDWIG rises into new light , a bold silver cross shining on her brow .

With a sigh , YITZHAK takes it and begins to put it on HEDWIG 'S head . HEDWIG stops him .

He grants it and they dance . She releases his hand , setting him free . YITZHAK is bewildered at first . Then he slowly descends the stage and exits into the house with the grace of new hope .
