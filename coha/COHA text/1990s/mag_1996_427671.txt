Section : News you can use The mercury is dropping . Prices of Caribbean cruises are , too . We sampled two packages <p> Lazy days at sea . Lounging poolside , a cold drink in one hand , a hot read in the other . Deep-blue Caribbean waters all around . Prices dropping like a rusty anchor . Is your soul stirring yet ? <p> If so , you could wind up among the 4.6 million people expected to take a cruise this year  --  three times as many as in 1980 . And the cruise lines want more . They are adding 30 or so new ships by the end of the decade , like the largest vessel yet , the 100,000-ton Carnival Destiny , which made its debut last month . To fill the vessels , first timers must be molded into repeaters . <p> That means fabulous bargains . Even heading into Caribbean peak season later this month , you can find deals as low as $549 a person for seven-day cruises . Discounts of up to 75 percent off the official " brochure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what do you get on a mass-market cruise ? To find out , I took two voyages , with my employer paying all expenses . A short hop to Nassau on a Carnival megaliner represented the economy end of the spectrum . A weeklong cruise through the western Caribbean on a smaller , more traditional Holland America ship was more upscale . CRUISE NO. 1 : HYPER <p> Las Vegas meets Mall of America , with overtones of spring break . A supercharged party atmosphere , enhanced by miles of garish neon lighting , engulfed me as soon as I stepped aboard to find roving waiters stuffing tropical drinks into everyone 's hands ( for a price  --  $6 for the high-octane " Funship Special " ) . Nothing prepares you for the sensory assault , not even the wry , insightful Fielding 's Worldwide Cruises 1997 by Shirley Slater and Harry Basch ( $19.95 ) . <p> The brochure rate for my three-day early-November cruise from Miami to Nassau and back on Carnival 's 2,000-passenger , 70,000-ton Ecstasy , based on double occupancy in a lower-deck cabin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $199 . The Cruise Line , a Miami-based discount-cruise-only travel agency ( 800-777-0707 ) , was even able to knock off an additional $26.50 . I did have to pay 50 percent more to go as a single , and $84.50 in port charges and fees brought the fare to $356.50 . <p> The Sail &; Sign card issued to all passengers was good for charging suntan lotion , a half-day excursion to the Blue Lagoon in the Bahamas ( $26 ) and drinks other than the free iced tea or coffee ( at $3 , Jamaican Red Stripe beer was cheaper than Evian ) . All shipboard purchases , in other words , and all settled before leaving the ship . Cash was legal tender only in the huge and constantly populated Crystal Palace Casino , with 226 slot machines alone . My final bill , including tips but not airfare  --  or an unlucky turn at the blackjack tables  --  was $525 , or $175 per day . <p> Gambling and hard drinking seemed to be the major diversions , both activities rarely pursued within sight of the waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inside a high-rise hotel rather than on board a cruise ship . <p> No one seemed to mind . Twenty-something muscle-shirted guys and Spandexed women along with couples in their 30s and 40s , a fair number with kids in tow , outnumbered older couples . Around the pool on the Lido deck , oiled , beverage-consuming bodies lined up cheek to cheek to take in the men 's hairy-chest contest , which blindfolded women judged by feel . It was one of the few activities that mixed drinking and an ocean view . <p> Nonstop chomping . The food was plentiful , of course . Nine meals a day included afternoon tea , a midnight buffet and a minibreakfast buffet at 1:30 a.m. for diehard disco-hounds with the munchies . Dinner entrees were on the small side ; my tablemates happily ordered two . <p> A high point was docking in Nassau for 24 hours , a refreshingly lengthy stay as cruises go . Nassau can be a tourist trap . The cruise director handed out a detailed map of not-to-be-missed stores , all of which pay to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of operation let me go to the beach and shopping , return for dinner , go out for casino action and dance to a calypso band until the wee hours . The organized shore excursion to Blue Lagoon was too organized . We were herded to " secluded " beaches about as secluded as the Jersey shore over the Fourth of July . The canned music and crammed-together hammocks contributed to the contrived , touristy feel . <p> Overall reaction ? I loved the pampering . Where else at this price can you get free room service at any hour and a steward who changes your towels twice a day ? But the roofed-over , sprawling , climate-controlled environment was too evocative of the food court at a megamall . If I 'm at sea , I want to know I 'm at sea without having to go to the top deck . CRUISE NO. 2 : STORMY <p> I knew where I was on my second voyage , all right : on a very big boat trying to ride out 20-foot swells in 50-mph winds . My mid-November cruise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , Jamaica and Grand Cayman was marred by a storm system that locked the entire Caribbean in a violent six-day embrace . <p> My deluxe outside cabin on an upper deck cost $935 per person , double occupancy , less than half the $2,012 brochure price . Again , I had to pay a 50 percent premium as a single , so the base price was $1,403 . But the grand total was $1,818 , or $260 per day , after port taxes ( $120 ) , a tour of the Mayan ruins at Tulum ( $65 ) , meals in Key West and Grand Cayman ( $40 ) , a massage ( $70 ) , beverages ( $60 ) and tips ( $60 ) . <p> Bad weather is far worse on a cruise than on land . All fresh-air activities on the lovely , wide teak decks , from swimming to volleyball , were off-limits because of the wind . Working out in the fitness center was almost impossible when standing upright was a challenge . I began to sag with fatigue and headaches . Seasickness was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags hung strategically near the elevators , at the entrance to the dining room and in just about every other public area . <p> The Noordam itself was an antidote to the all-out pace of my first trip . The ship is half the Ecstasy 's size , with elegant but cozy lounges , antiques and a million-dollar collection of art , including model ships carved from ivory . The passengers were older and less uninhibited . And most were with a mate , not looking for one . <p> The crew did its spirited best to cope . The food was bland , perhaps just as well considering the state of our stomachs . Since I was n't as incapacitated as many of my shipmates were , one of my favorite spots was the Crow 's Nest , a lounge at the forwardmost top of the ship , with tall , skinny windows more than halfway around . I could n't take it for long periods , but the bartenders were loquacious and the waves would crash against the windows nine decks up as the ship shuddered in protest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an extra day instead . That was understandable . What was not was the line 's token gesture of a $22 credit for our unused port taxes and a glass of champagne with dinner . Weather is weather , and each cruise contract has an acts-of-God exclusion . But a discount on a future cruise would have disposed passengers far more kindly toward Holland America . Ann Bollesen , the line 's spokesperson , expressed apologies on my return from the high seas but stood firm . " It would have cost a fortune to compensate every passenger on every ship out there , " she said . <p> Different policy . Other lines , such as Princess , are more willing to open their pockets after prolonged bad weather . Carnival is known for letting the liquor flow gratis . Even some Caribbean resorts feel that bad weather sours the good times they feel obligated to provide . " If guests tell us they did n't enjoy their stay , no matter what the cause , we 'll invite them back on us , " says Atef Mankarios , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay and Caneel Bay in the Virgin Islands . <p> Cruise passengers who feel that any situation has been mishandled , from bad weather to surly service , should speak up . Upon returning , send off a letter to the cruise line , preferably signed by your travel agent as well . Do n't write an emotional screed . State how you feel the line should compensate you . Demanding a full refund because you returned home without a suntan will fall on unsympathetic ears ; suggesting a percentage refund equal to the time ruined , say , 15 percent for the missed day in Jamaica , is fair , but still not a sure thing . Most cruise lines say they will decide what is appropriate case by case but often opt for future discounts . In my situation , Bollesen 's answer was simple : " When it 's something we ca n't control , we ca n't provide compensation . " <p> Veteran cruise fans often avoid the Caribbean during hurricane season , from late summer through the end of November . Do not accept the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that stabilizers on modern ships have all but eliminated motion sickness . Besides , the earlier nightfall in autumn eats into lazy days in the sun . I eagerly anticipated seeing the Mayan ruins at Chichen Itza ; the tour was suspended for the season in October . <p> But traumas and disillusionment fade . I 've been flipping through those brochures , picturing myself back in that deck chair . Besides , several people regaled me with accounts of the fantastic time they had on storm-tossed seas . It was better than any adventure trip they could have planned , and undoubtedly cheaper . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : ABOARD THE ECSTASY .

Beddingfield <p> THE SAFETY QUESTION <p> Good track record <p> Are cruises safe ? Pretty much . No passenger of a cruise line that docks at U.S. ports has died in a cruise-related incident in more than 10 years . <p> Two groundings due to navigational foul-ups and two engine-room fires ( one injuring seven passengers ) in the summer of 1995 , however , prompted the formation of a U.S. Coast Guard task force . The group concluded that cruise ships are " among the safest modes of transportation available " but also recommended improvements in crew training and better communication among multilingual staff members . <p> Today 's enormous , elaborately constructed ships also pose new risks . Huge atriums spanning several decks can act as chimneys in a fire , for instance . Smoke detectors , sprinklers and low-level lighting have eased most concerns , say experts , and will be mandatory as of October 1997 under the international Safety of Life at Sea convention . <p> The Coast Guard conducts scheduled safety inspections of every cruise ship four times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prevention inspects ships twice a year , unannounced , to check on aspects of sanitation , from food preparation to chemicals used in pools and Jacuzzis . The latest sanitation scores for all ships are available by fax ( 404-332-4565 ; request document number 510051 ) and on the Web http : **32;1388;TOOLONG . For a detailed report on a specific ship , write Vessel Sanitation Program , 1015 North American Way , Room 107 , Miami , FL 33132 . <p> The Coast Guard is not staffed to handle questions about the accident record of particular ships . Coast Guard spokesman Jack O'Dell says only : " We are n't going to let any ship set sail with passengers if it is n't safe . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Dry run .
