The high mountains of east-central Arizona are a world apart from the Sonoran Desert to the southwest and the arid mesas and plateaus of Navajo country to the north . These are the White Mountains , where winter temperatures often drop to 30deg F below zero , snowfall averages six feet a year , and clear mountain streams ripple past towering spruces and Douglas firs . Dotted with small communities , such as Alpine , Eager , Springerville , and Greer , the region is divided between the Fort Apache Indian Reservation and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests . Among the biologically important locales on Forest Service land is a wetland and adjacent grassy meadow and forest that make up the 330-acre Phelps Cabin Research Natural Area . The area takes its name from a log cabin on a former homestead , now unoccupied . The Research Natural Area is reached from the southern arm of the Mount Baldy hiking trail , which loops west of Forest Road 113 . The trail climbs the slopes of the massive mountain but passes short of the summit , which is sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet from the trail head , the path bursts through a grove of blue spruces and quaking aspens into a meadow that flourishes during the growing season , from late April to September . The meadow owes its presence to a combination of high elevation and southern exposure . Apart from some weedy bromegrass that grows along the hiking trail , it is pristine . The native grass species include Idaho fescue , Idaho bent grass , bluejoint grass , hair grass , and June grass . All are palatable to grazing animals , but domestic livestock are now excluded . The grasses generally produce inconspicuous flowers , but a number of wildflowers also bloom in the meadow . Among them are a blue flax , with a slender stem and a large flower ; a magenta wild geranium ; American harebell with its solitary , blue , bell-shaped , nodding flower ; and three yellow wildflowers  --  a goldenrod , a groundsel , and a mountain dandelion . The grassy meadow slopes toward the East Fork of the Little Colorado River , a sparkling stream only a few feet wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams line the banks or grow in the flowing water . They are the western elderberry , thin-leaf alder , and three willows  --  coyote , Scouler 's , and whiplash . The marshy to boggy wetland that extends several feet back from either side of the creek , covering about thirty-five acres , is the focal point of the Research Natural Area . Botanists have recorded sixty-one species of flowering plants there , including numerous grasses , sedges , and rushes and showier species representing a wide range of plant families . Among the common wildflowers are Rocky Mountain iris , marsh marigold , monkshood , two monkey flowers , a skullcap of the mint family , hemlock parsley , Fendler 's cowbane , and a bog orchid . Corn lily , which stands up to five feet tall , has huge , round leaves that appear corrugated because of their elevated veins . Growing submerged in the water or with some floating leaves are the aquatic white-flowered buttercup , the little heart-leaved buttercup , and a waterwort . The yellow-flowered cinquefoil , a shrubby species nearly ubiquitous in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances upslope into the grassy meadows . The Research Natural Area also includes 194 acres of the adjacent forest , made up of Engelmann spruce , blue spruce , and Douglas fir . Beneath these cone-bearing trees , which are more abundant as one climbs higher up the slopes of Mount Baldy , are rich layers of shrubs and wildflowers . The most common shrubs are the gooseberry currant and bearberry honeysuckle , whose twin blue-black berries are nestled between a pair of lip-red leaves . The wildflowers include three kinds of wild orchids , northern bedstraw , and the false Solomon's-seal . Forests such as this are characteristic of more northerly regions . In all likelihood , the coniferous tree species and their associated flora were driven southward by glaciation during the Ice Age . Then , as conditions warmed and the ice retreated , they were left isolated on the high , cool mountains .
