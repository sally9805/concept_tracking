The right present can pay smart-and unexpected-dividends By Diane Harris // Tired of Tickle-Me-Elmo and the latest incarnation of Barbie ? Looking for a holiday present that teaches something important while it amuses ? Try something in a pleasing shade of green . We 're talking about money-not cold cash or a stodgy savings bond , but a money-related gift to help your child learn how to save , invest , and spend wisely . Precisely what to give your child depends partly on his age and partly on what you 're trying to accomplish . For instance , a share of stock in his favorite company may introduce your 10-year-old to the joys of investing , but it wo n't teach him broader economic concepts the way a nifty board game like the Game of Life would . And Life 's lessons are likely to be lost on a 4-year-old who ca n't figure out why Mommy says a dime is worth more than a nickel when a nickel is clearly bigger . Some money gifts get their message across without your help , while others require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no matter what you give , it will have a stronger impact if you invest some of your own time along with it . " Whether the gift walks , talks , or glows in the dark , it wo n't make a whole lot of difference unless you get down there and explain the concepts , " says financial expert Adriane G. Berg , coauthor , with son Arthur Berg Bochner , 12 , of The Totally Awesome Money Book for Kids ( And Their Parents ) . AGES 3 TO 5 : SMALL SAVERS , BIG CONCEPTS For the nursery-school set , stick with presents that help teach basic facts about the way money works , rather than trying to get across abstract ideas like saving and investing . " A beautifully decorated piggy bank or a toy cash register with some spare change in it can make a wonderful gift for a preschooler , " says Elizabeth Lewin , a financial planner in Westport , CT , and coauthor of Simple Ways to Help Your Kids Become Dollar-Smart . " Then make a game of identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all worth . " You can round out the gift with a paperback book that sends a simple message about the value of saving or thoughtful spending . Some engaging choices include Alexander , Who Used to Be Rich Last Sunday , by Judith Viorst ( Aladdin Paperbacks ) ; Something Special For Me , by Vera B. Williams ( William Morrow ) ; and The Berenstain Bears Get the Gimmies , by Stan and Jan Berenstain ( Random House ) . AGES 6 TO 9 : GETTING THE HANG OF IT There 's probably no better way to interest kids in investing than to buy them a share of stock in a company whose products they love . To enhance a stock 's initial appeal , try pairing the shares with a product from the company 's roster . You might , for example , give a Barbie doll or Hot Wheels car along with a share of Mattel , or a Hercules toy with Walt Disney stock . " The trick is to turn an intangible concept like investing into something tangible and fun , " says Brent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a nonprofit educational organization in Denver . Be forewarned , though : A gift of stock is n't cheap . Disney was recently trading at close to $80-and that 's before you add on the commission you 'll pay to the broker who conducts the transaction for you . To keep your costs down , consider buying through a discount brokerage that does n't require a minimum to open an account , or buy stock in one of the growing number of companies that allow investors to buy shares directly from them , eliminating the middleman fee . ( If you need some help getting grounded in investment basics , check out an adult primer , such as 10 Minute Guide to the Stock Market , by Dian Vujovick ( Alpha Books ) or If You 're Clueless About the Stock Market and Want to Know More , by Seth Godin ( Dearborn Trade ) . Photograph // If you 're more interested in helping your child learn the value of a buck than in creating the next Warren Buffett , a number of software programs and boxed games can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try Cool Cash Bingo ( Learning Resources , $18 ; 800-222-3909 ) , Presto Change-O ( Educational Insights , $25 ; 800-933-3277 ) , or Moneywise Kids ( Aristoplay , $15 ; 800-6347738 ) . Among CD-ROMs , you 'll find one or more financially related activities in several popular math series , and at least one program that devotes itself entirely to the subject : Money Town ( Davidson &; Associates/Simon &; Schuster , $30 ; 800457-8357 ) , which contains five games that teach basic money math , a little financial history , and some simple money-management concepts . AGES 10 AND UP : GOING FOR THE GOLD A gift of stock in a familiar company works just as well for older children as for small-frys . But you might also consider one of a handful of mutual funds marketed specifically for kids . Sponsored by companies such as AIG and American Express , these funds offer all the benefits of a well-diversified growth-stock portfolio , with colorful tools for teaching kids about money thrown in for free . The top pick of Michael Kabarec , a financial adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fund ( 800-4035437 ; minimum investment , $100 for investors who establish an automatic investing plan ) . It 's gained 32 percent annually over the past three years , compared with 22 percent for the average growth fund . Older kids are also able to enjoy more sophisticated games and software that can enhance everyday money skills . One worthy CD-ROM contender : Math for the Real World ( Davidson &; Associates , $30 ; 800457-8357 ) , in which kids hit the computerized road as members of a touring rock band and along the way meet such real-life money challenges as splitting restaurant bills and shopping for the best deals on lodging and musical equipment . And do n't forget classic board games such as Monopoly ( $11 ) and the Game of Life ( $13 ) , along with newer financially oriented entries like Parker Brothers ' Payday ( $15 ) and the Stock Market Game ( $30 ) , and Stock Market Guru ( $30 ) from the National Center for Financial Education ( 619-232-8811 ) . Says Neiser , " In a very engaging way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and negotiation , and , most important , that many of our actions have financial consequences . " And if you 're lucky , the consequence of your giving such a gameor any money-related gift-will be to set your child squarely on the path to financial savvy as an adult-or at least on his or her way . <p>
