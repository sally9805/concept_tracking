When Germany created the world 's most advanced rubbish-reclamation system last year , Environment Minister Klaus Topfer proudly declared , " When it comes to recycling , we Germans are world champions . " In fact , they are too good . Householders participating in the Green Dot program are discarding recyclable trash  --  which features a special green trademark  --  at such a prodigious rate that the whole system is in danger of breaking down . <P> Something like 100,000 tons of packaging materials bearing the green symbol of recyclability have piled up in warehouses , farm fields and abandoned aircraft hangers from Hamburg to Augsburg . Much more has been shipped abroad , some of it as far away as Indonesia , helping Germany become the globe 's biggest exporter of trash . " This system has made us world-class litterbugs , " says Norbert Barth , a spokesman for the environmentalist Greens party . " It is a waste-export system , not a waste-recycling system . " <P> It all started out as a good , green idea . In 1991 , 600 private firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed a nonprofit venture , Duales System Deutschland , to help comply with new laws that make companies responsible for the recovery and recycling of all packaging materials . Ultimately , the legislation envisions recycling all manufactured products , including computers , refrigerators , clothing , even entire automobiles . <P> The DSD venture operates alongside conventional collection services . Bright orange city trucks service regular rubbish bins , while purple DSD vehicles empty yellow containers set aside for trash  --  mainly plastics and metals  --  bearing the Green Dot , which signifies that the owner has paid DSD to recycle ( average bill per package : 25 cents ) . <P> Right now , 95% of German households participate in the program , generating 400,000 tons of sorted trash annually . But DSD can recycle little more than 125,000 tons a year . Meanwhile , because of the backlog and the failure of many participating companies to pay their full dues , DSD has plunged $500 million into debt . Much of the money is owed to local governments for collection and storage of refuse ; Frankfurt and Stuttgart are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opponents are scathing in their criticism of the well-intentioned effort . " The designers of this system should have known that most people would observe it , " says Volrad Wolny , a waste-management expert at Eco-Institute , an environmental watchdog organization . " Ecological awareness in Germany is very high . " He says DSD executives gave guarantees they knew could not be met . " They knew they did not have the technology in place . " Wolny and others want to compel producers to cut plastic packaging by up to 50% . And the Greens , meanwhile , feel the Green Dot gives their party a bad name . They would like to banish the misleading symbol altogether .
