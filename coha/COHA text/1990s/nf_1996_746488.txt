Fumbling around recently on a friend 's computer in a program I do n't know , I clicked on her thesaurus in hopes of finding an alternative term . I was trying to avoid overusing the word " tools . " The options that appeared on the screen brought all you clever types immediately to mind ! The alternatives that the thesaurus offered described the wonderful solutions you are constantly concocting in your daily rounds : doodads , doohickies , and thingamajigs , gadgets , gimmicks , and contraptions  --  the very stuff that you create just to do your jobs . These creations of concept and craft make SPRINGBOARD valid and valuable . And they help us all do our jobs ! Thanks to all of you who have shared , and we look forward to hearing from more of you soon ! <p> Mary Gordon of Kansas shares a stroke of both genius and ingenuity as she tells how she helped her student " reach for the stars . " My Stars ! ! ! <p> When a totally blind student decided to take astronomy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningful for her . One idea that helped her , and has since helped several other students , was an umbrella that I used to show the rotation of constellations around Polaris ( North Star ) . <p> The astronomy teacher gave me an old umbrella . It was a very highly arched one of clear plastic . On the inside of the umbrella , I glued different sizes of yarn balls to show the major stars of different constellations , The North Star was a large ball at the top of the umbrella . I placed the other balls in the shapes of the major constellations , as shown on the sheet that the teacher handed out . I then connected the point stars with yarn to show the shapes of the constellations . I placed Braille labels on the North Star , some of the other major stars , and the names of the constellations . By spinning the handle of the umbrella , she could keep one hand on the North Star and see how the constellations rotated around it . <p> She not only learned this concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sun , the moon , planets , and stars , is all around us . When I put her hands on the edge of the umbrella ( which was about shoulder high to her ) , I said that this could represent the horizon . She knew that the earth rotated and that the sun did not move , so I said , as I moved her hand across the umbrella , " It appears that the sun comes up on this side , goes up and over our heads , and goes down on the other side . " She remarked , " Oh ! I thought things were just flat up there ! " She was surprised to learn that sometimes the sun or moon is straight out in front of us . <p> The concept that things in space are " around " us , not just " over " us , was very important for her . This visualization was probably more useful than understanding the rotation of the constellations ! <p> ( Note : I made this about 8 or 9 years ago ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used now . For example , puff paint could be used to connect the " stars " rather than yarn . ) Mary Gordon Teacher of Blind and Visually Impaired Central Junior High School 1400 Massachusetts Street , Lawrence , KS 66044 <p> <p> Julie Dahlberg is an orientation and mobility specialist at the Oregon School for the Blind in Salem . She devised an effective method of helping " Chatty Cathies " learn to be more appropriate in when and what they say . This is a technique that has obvious merit for one-on-one teaching and can also be adapted for classroom instruction or group activities . It 's in the Cards <p> Talk Cards are designed for students who tend to talk a lot , talk about things not related to the subject , or repeatedly demand attention from the staff by " sharing . " The idea behind Talk Cards is to help students develop the judgment and control to decide what they want to share aloud and to choose an appropriate time to do so . <p> Each card allows 30 to 60 seconds of " free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to say . I designate a certain number of cards for a time period , e.g. , 4 " talk cards " for a 15- to 30-minute lesson . A student may choose to use all his " talk cards " at once or sprinkle them throughout the lesson . If all the cards are used in one " monologue , " he must be quiet for the rest of the lesson . Without giving a talk card to the instructor , the student must remain quiet . <p> A student can give a talk card to me in a variety of ways . When we are out on a mobility lesson , he can just reach into his pocket and hand it to me . When we are in the classroom , he must raise his hand , holding the " talk card " in the air . I pick it up , thus indicating that I am listening . <p> When a student gives me a " talk card , " I give my undivided attention . Knowing this , the student wo n't repeat what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the impulse to talk all the time and to share everything they are thinking . This eliminates incessant babbling and calling out to get an adult 's attention . The cards grant students opportunities to talk and the responsibility to decide what is important to share and when it is appropriate to do so . <p> Many times students do not use all the talk cards within a lesson because they saved them for something really important they wanted to share , but nothing came up . Students learn to space their talk cards to last the whole lesson . This means there are fewer distractions within the lesson , and the student is able to concentrate on what is said . It also prevents a battle over who is supposed to be talking . <p> Giving the students the control to decide what is important and what can wait is a powerful tool . Eventually , the students do not need the talk cards . They learn to remain quiet and focused on the lesson and to share ideas and thoughts at appropriate times , some of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon School for the Blind 700 Church Street , S.E. , Salem , OR 97301 <p> <p> Anna Swenson of Virginia was a contributor to the very first SPRINGBOARD issue and has been a faithful contributor to both this column and to RE:view . Here she shares a simple but brilliant way of expanding spelling lessons to include a student 's personal world . Tailor-made Spelling Lists <p> Acquiring good conventional spelling skills is often difficult for students who read Braille . They must learn to spell many words two ways  --  in contracted and uncontracted form  --  and they miss the incidental learning that comes from exposure to the myriad of words that surround visual learners on signs , TV , candy bars , cereal boxes , clothes labels , to name a few . <p> I keep this in mind as I transcribe each student 's Braille work . I keep a running list of words the student has misspelled . Journal entries are especially rich in words from the student 's everyday vocabulary and words that are frequently not in the curricular vocabulary : McDonald 's , names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student has taken the weekly spelling unit pretest from the textbook , I revise the week 's word list by deleting words that have been spelled correctly and substitute words from the individualized list . <p> If possible , I group together words that follow a particular spelling rule or pattern , e.g. , baby  --  babies , fairy  --  fairies . Individual students often contribute words they are eager to learn to spell . A sixth grader asked me to include one state each week on his list ! <p> This results in individualized spelling lists that contain words students actually use in writing about their own worlds .

In the following tip , she tells us how she does it even from a distance . Staying Within Earshot <p> It is always a challenge for O &M; teachers to closely monitor students during independent travel and still allow it to be independent ! Two-way walkie-talkie headsets have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interim step toward independence . <p> I often use the headsets when a student is first attempting a newly learned route on his or her own . With headsets , I can remove my physical presence while maintaining contact . As the kinks are worked out of the route and the student gains confidence , we both remove the headsets . <p> From an instructor 's point of view , it is particularly interesting and even helpful to listen to the comments muttered by students as they actively solve problems and make decisions . One drawback to the headsets is that they do not always work well in downtown areas .
