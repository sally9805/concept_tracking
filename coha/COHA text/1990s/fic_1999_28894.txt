Bertinierre May 1829 At the ball celebrating her twenty-fifth birthday , Crown Princess Laurentia scrutinized the leering , timid , swaggering , toe-dragging , eloquent , stuttering sea of black and white evening wear and thought she had never seen such a pitiable pool of suitors in her life . And they were hers . All hers . " My dear , that smile looks much like the one you don when you suffer the headache , but you are still required to launch a ship . " She did n't look at her father , as was protocol . Each of their gestures , their glances , their words had been choreographed in advance . She stood at King Jerome 's right hand while he sat on the glided , ancient , throne of Bertinierre . Both wore elegant smiles . One by one gentlemen moved forward to the foot of the dais to make their bows to the womanor more accurately , the kingdomthey hoped to win . Yet King Jerome spoke in a tone that carried no farther than her ears , and he sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And why not ? She 'd made him a promise , and he hoped that promise would lead to the fulfillment of his dearest dream . Hers , too , she reminded herself . She was the only heir to the tiny Mediterranean kingdom of Bertinierre , and she must produce a child , preferably two , before her fruitful youth vanished . Too bad the whole thing left her feeling like an unpollinated apple tree . " And these are the bees . " To atone for her uncharitable comment , she rewardedher lady-in-waiting 's current presentation , a Mr. Andrew N. Sharparrow , with a slightly warmer smile . He returned it , and took another bow while Weltrude lifted her smartly-groomed brows in inquiry . Responding to the prearranged signal , Laurentia blinked twice , and the Englishman was sent on his way , allowing another to take his place . " Perhaps when you 're married you 'll stop talking to yourself , " said her father . " Probably not . I enjoy intelligent conversation . " He chuckled , then smothered his mirth behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor lads a chance . " She chose to ignore his remark . " Besides , you talk to yourself . " Taking her gloved hand , he patted it between his palms . " I used to talk to your mother . I still do , the best way I know how . " Giving in to temptation , she looked down into his warm brown eyes and wished , not for the first time , that she could be more like himintelligent , yet kind . Without conceit , she knew she was intelligent , too , but her intelligence contained the sting of acerbity . She had endless patience with children and the feeble of mind , but for those who chose to waste their God-given gifts in idleness and frivolity she felt a vast disdain . Unfortunately , that included too many of the wealthy , well-born gentlemen milling around the grand cream and gilt ballroom . A nobleman so ancient he could have been her father 's father made his bow before them , and toppled over . Weltrude , large , big-boned , and stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the step . Jerome indicated that one of his personal guard should assist the aged suitor . " How does he dare to think I would allow my beautiful girl to go to him ? " " Not everyone thinks quite as well of my looks as you do , Papa . " Certainly not Beaumont , the English Earl of Burlingame ... and her first husband . " Have you thought you might be influenced by a parent 's prejudice ? " " You look exactly like your mother , " King Jerome said with finality . That , in his mind , settled the matter of her beauty . The portrait of Queen Enid and her four-year-old daughter hung in the royal gallery , Laurentia a miniature of the petite , small-boned , regal Welshwoman who had won his heart thirty years ago . But the wavy black hair , fair skin , and melting green eyes which revealed Queen Enid 's true serenity were nothing but camouflage on Laurentia . Laurentia well remembered the torture of standing for the portrait , of shouting that she wanted to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bribes of candy King Jerome offered to keep her still , and the way the artist glared at her when she cried . She knew her protruding lower lip drawn into the portrait aptly represented a sulky princess . She did n't sulk anymoremuchand she never stomped her foot , but the devil 's own temper lurked not far beneath her civilized demeanor , and always she kept a firm rein on it . Always ... except for those moments when the day had been long , and people had been aggravating , and she sat alone in her chamber . Then an impassive Weltrude shut the door on Laurentia 's fury . Tonight could very well be such a night . King Jerome spoke . " If none of the rest of them please you , Laurentia ... I suppose you can have Francis . " Francis ? He would allow her to take Francis , Comte de Radcote , her former playmate ? Bertinierre 's home minister , the man she had concluded she should wedthe man King Jerome himself had refused to consider ? Exasperated beyond coherence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then what ... then why are we doing this ? " " You know why . " Her gaze sought Francis toward the end of the line that wound , seemingly for leagues , across the glossy black-and-white checked marble floor . She located him by his height and distinguished bearing , and barely took note of the excessively handsome Sicilian duke making his bow . " Papa , Francis is a good man . He would give his life for me . " " I know . I know . " King Jerome lifted his hand when she would have continued to remonstrate him . " But he is proper . " " So he is . That 's what I like about him . " " Like . " King Jerome imbued the word with scorn . " Yes . Like . We have everything in common . He 's from one of the oldest families in Bertinierre . He understands my duties as few do . He 's knowledgeable and responsible . " " And proper . " If anything , King Jerome sounded even more annoyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again like the first time . " " You wo n't let yourself . " " Of course not . " She would have to be insane herself to fall for a man with the violence and passion she had felt for Beaumont . " You were a young girl infatuated with a handsome older man . I should have known better . " " How ? Who could have ever known Beaumont would be " She hesitated to put a word to it . Especially here . Especially now . They were saying too much already in too public a venue . King Jerome , too , must have thought the subject too sensitive to broach , for he said , " You stare out over the crowd , too proud to condemn Beaumont and through him , me and my carelessness . But I know you , Laurentia , and I know you still bear the scars . " " That 's quite dramatic . " Her gaze flicked impatiently over Prince von Fulda , bowing with a flutter of his white-gloved hand . " Beaumont never laid an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you give me credit for . " " And more armored against love than any woman should be . " " Love . " She invested that word with as much scorn as he had given the detested " like . " " You brought all these men here . Did you think I would see one across the crowded ballroom , a shaft of lightning would strike us both , the violins would sing , and I 'd fly to the arms of my dearest beloved ? " He shifted uncomfortably on the throne . " Oh , Papa . " Confound his fanciful soul ! " I do n't want a dearest beloved , I just need a husband in my bed . " " A functioning husband , King Jerome insisted . " Francis would be that . " And if she suspected lovemaking with Francis would be less than passionate , well , even a little passion would be a new experience for her . Catching Francis 's gaze , she smiled at him , a quirk of the lips . A man like that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tower of strength in the forthcoming years , when her father must inevitably die and she would become queen . She faced that reality without flinching , as she 'd been taught to face all the harsh facts of her life . The line had dwindled , Francis had been presented , when Weltrude said , " Your Highness ? " Her black silk dress was orderly and discreet . Her flawlessly styled brown wig covered the traces of gray in her hair . Although Laurentia suspected Weltrude had been born around the turn of the century , her creamy complexion was almost completely unclined . She was the perfect lady-in-waiting for an imperfect princess , and Laurentia sometimes wondered if the strain would someday prove too much . Thus far it never had , and now as Weltrude stood on the bottom step of the dais , her smile curved her rouged lips just the proper amount and no more . " Is there a gentleman you would like to have as an escort for the first dance ? " Laurentia thought to take Francis , but King Jerome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Papa . " She smiled , charmed by his old-fashioned gallantry . " Anyone else you choose will be viewed as your favorite . " Her father 's gaze swept the ballroom , and in disappointed tones he muttered , " Bloodless worms . " Taking her hand , he led her to the center of the empty floor . As all eyes focused on them , she experienced a chill , like the cold creep of unfamiliar fingers up her spine . How odd to be uneasy in her-own ballroom . This disquiet must be the result of so many desperate , hopeful , needy suitors piling their hopes on her slender , shoulders . King Jerome made his bow , and as she curtsied , she determinedly shook off her caprice . " Papa , you are quite the handsomest man in the ballroom . " " I can scarcely deny that . " His eyes twinkled at her as the orchestra struck up a waltzher father was fond of waltzes , having performed them in his youth when they were not respectableand they whirled around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore the marks of forty years of ruling , of the struggles of war and the constant difficulties of diplomacy . Yet he was handsome , as many eager ladies had noted , with a beak of a nose over gray mustache and trimmed and pointed beard . Bushy gray eyebrows encroached on his receding hairline , and his pristine white uniform was decorated with the insignia of the highest commander of the cavalry . The scent of his favorite cigars transported Laurentia back to a time when she sat on his knee and he made everything all better . In his arms , she relaxed and enjoyed the impetuous flight around the floor , a petite princess in a rose taffeta gown with her hair upswept in an ethereal creation , dancing with a still-vigorous king who performed his duty with energy and ease . As the dance neared its end , other couples flooded the floor , allowed on by Weltrude 's nod . When the next dance began , Laurentia found herself faced with a suitor chosen at random . Prince Germain of Bavaria was charming and charmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress of Vienna fourteen years before . He failed to comprehend that she remembered everyone ; it was her duty as princess . The brief dance ended , and another man took his place . He was shy , with little conversation ; Laurentia had to draw him out . Another followed , and another , until Laurentia 's feet hurt and her cheeks ached from holding her smile in place . It was Francis who gave her a lull , putting his hand on her waist and pulling her closebut not too close . " You do n't have to look pleasant for me , " he said easily . " Thank you . " She allowed her face to settle into its at-rest expression . " Although I feel as if I 'm scowling at you . " " Not at all . Your dimples appear to have created permanent creases in your cheeks . " She laughed , her smile returning for a natural appearance . " That sounds attractive ! " " It is , perhaps , the sign of things to come . As one grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than perfect complexion . " He had n't been joking about the creases in her cheeks , nor did he see a problem with reminding her of her approaching middle age . Now only half-laughing , she retorted , " I am not so conceited as to worry about that ! " " Like an women , you have your little vanities . " As he had his . He enjoyed training the little wave of brown hair above his forehead . He rode horses every day because gentlemen exercised their horses . It gave him , he had once told her earnestly , a strong physique . Yes , he had his vanities , and his drawbacks . He lacked a sense of humor , and stared uncomprehending at her jokes . But he compensated for his shortcomings with his sincerity . With him , she would never have to portray herself as regal or lofty . They knew each other too well for pretense , which explained why she could n't imagine him naked , panting , lost in passion . Francis would never give way to any uncontrollable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her want to giggle . " You are smiling again . " He meticulously kept their bodies apart at the prescribed distance . " Do n't grace me with that gracious , royal smirk , Your Highness . Just say you 'll be my wife . " She wanted to , so badly , but she could n't hurt her father by scorning the celebrations he had planned with such enthusiasm . Even if he agreed to this match , he wanted her to have this night . Intent on evading Francis 's gaze , she stared toward the long row of glass-paned doors that led to the terrace . " I have waited all through your first marriage , your bereavement , and this inexplicable foot-dragging . " He spoke vehemently , but quietly , never forgetting that couples swirled around them and the eyes of the kingdom judged them . " I have waited . Who can say as much ? " " No one , " she admitted . " But you make me feel as if I owe you for what you elected to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was n't . Only Francis had decided on the right thing , and he did n't understand why she would n't allow him to guide her . She had been taught to think for herself , and Francis had been taught that a man should think for his wife . She foresaw trouble ahead , yet what man believed any differently than Francis ? The music slowed . Francis bowed as formally as if she had never , on the occasion of her ninth birthday , given way to fury and broken a thousand-year-old Ming vase over his head . She wanted to do it again right now . If only he would sweep her into an alcove , take her in his arms , and declare his love , or even just his resolve to have her . In one dreadful moment of wavering , she wondereddid she dare wed a man she 'd never even kissed ? Francis stepped away . Weltrude waved another candidate forward . The orchestra played the opening chords of a formal minuet . Laurentia 's rebellion abruptly rushed forth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air with her hand , and the music ceased so abruptly that all chatter died , too . Using her gracious princess smile , Laurentia indicated that the festivities should continue . Conversation rose again as if that awkward pause had never occurred , and she made her way toward the one chamber where she could be alone . The water closet . Inside , she leaned against the door and closed her eyes . Why had her father insisted on this farce ? It had been difficult to resign herself to wanting only what she could have . Now , she wished to or not , she searched among the endless countenances for one special face that could make her love again . Her palms slid along the painted wood . Love . As if her wretched heart could continue to beat after another infection of love . Running away from the party seemed a good idea . Running away from herself seemed even better . If she were alone to think , she felt certain she could drive these inconsistent doubts from her mind . Opening the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her first instinct was to tiptoe away . Her good sense forced her to walk easily , as if slipping away from her own party was appropriate behavior . She strode through the study , the handle to the French doors opened smoothly , and she stepped onto the empty terrace where squares of light alternated with night 's shadows . Placing her palms against the wide , low , cool marble railing , she took gulps of fresh air . Gradually the scents of perfume and warm , nervous bodies faded from her consciousness , to be replaced by the fragrance of lilac from the garden , the salt-tang of the Mediterranean harbor below , the earthy odor of the vineyards clustered around the palace , and from somewhere , the faint scent of tobacco . Her brief rebellion against fate faded , too , as she concentrated On the palace that enveloped her , the mountains behind , the city spread out like a cloth spangled with lights . She loved this palace of hers . Her crusading ancestors had planted the original sandstone castle into the rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , copper-streaked marble and towers of granite and tile . Now the whole edifice grew like a gnarled and protective tree above the ancient city of Omnia . Garden terraces descended in floral steps down the cliff , each blushing with pleasure in daylight , each steeped in fragrance at night . The lights of Omnia glowed , and faintly Laurentia could hear the sounds of celebration as the inhabitants took a day from the rigors of fishing and trading to rejoice on her birthday . God bless them ; she knew many of the merchants and shopkeepers personally . She knew the farmers and vintners of the countryside , too , and the harvesters who lived deep in the Pyrenees , growing that rarest of herbs in their well-tended fields . These people were the ones who kept her kingdom alive . The common folk never knew that every day she and her father balanced on the tightrope of statesmanship to allow them their ways of life . Automatically her gaze traveled to the far end of the bay . The border of Pollardine began at the sea and nestled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries had once been allies . Now ... they were not . She heard doors opening around the far corner , and the music from the ballroom spilled out . Perhaps it was getting warm inside , or perhaps lovers sought the darkness , there to perform the rituals of courtship . She had no way of knowing what occurred in those brief moments , yet she 'd observed the woman 's feline smile of satisfaction , the man 's concentration on his mate . It would be pleasant , Laurentia thought , if any man ever concentrated on her instead of on her kingdom . She wishedquite ferventlythat such a man would come forward . The door behind her opened . For one moment , she thought her prayer had been answered . She felt a small thrill go through her body . Then her wits rescued her , and she realized she had simply been found , as was inevitable . Found by Weltrude , by one of the suitors , by her worried father . Turning , she faced the lone man silhouetted against the glass doors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accented his voice , and he wore a uniform . No , a livery . The royal livery . Puzzled , she studied him . She had never met him . " Yes ? " Steadily , he walked toward her , a beefy man whose bulk strained his jacket and smelled of sweat . His beefy hands reached out for her ; she tried to sidestep as she sputtered , " What do you think you 're doing ? " Without a word , he grabbed her around the waist and hefted her onto his shoulder .
