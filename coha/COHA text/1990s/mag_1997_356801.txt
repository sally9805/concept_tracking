The wanted posters tacked to the walls of courthouses around the country normally depict carjackers , kidnappers and other scruffy lawbreakers on the lam . But these days the flyers might just as well feature distinguished men and women in long dark robes beneath the headline HELP WANTED . As of this week , 100 seats on the 844-person federal bench are vacant . Case loads are creeping out of control , and sitting judges are crying for help . <P> The situation is urgent , says Procter Hug Jr. , chief judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , which covers California and eight other Western states . Hug says that with a third of its 28 seats vacant , the court has had to cancel hearings for about 600 cases this year . Criminal cases take precedence by law , so at both the trial and appellate levels , it is civil cases that have been crowded out . Civil rights cases , shareholder lawsuits , product-liability actions , medical-malpractice claims and so forth are being pushed to the back of the line , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southern district of Illinois went an entire year without hearing a single civil case , so overwhelmed was he by the criminal load in a jurisdiction down to two judges out of four . " It 's litigants who end up paying the price for the delays , " says A. Leo Levin , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School . <P> Things wo n't improve anytime soon .

At a private meeting with federal judges last week , Clinton promised to send close to two dozen new names to Capitol Hill by July 4 . But once they get there , they face new hurdles . Last year the Senate confirmed only 17 federal district-court judges and none for the appeals courts . This year looks even worse , with only two confirmations thus far . The number of days from nomination to confirmation is at a record high of 183 , and 24 seats have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial emergencies . <P> This slowdown in judicial confirmations is not due to congressional lethargy . Just the opposite . With Republicans firmly in control of the Senate , many of the party 's theorists feel they have the power  --  and the rightful mandate  --  to implement the ideals of a conservative revolution that lost its focus in recent years . So they have been not so quietly pursuing a historic change in the ambiguous " advise and consent " role the Constitution gives the Senate in the selection of federal judges . The successful assault by Democrats on Ronald Reagan 's nomination of Robert Bork for the Supreme Court helped open the way for what has become a more partisan and ideological examination of all judicial nominees .
