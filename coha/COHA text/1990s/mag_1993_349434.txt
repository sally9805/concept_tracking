Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman was not an obvious choice to be America 's ambassador in Paris , and not just because she is neither American- born nor of French heritage . The daughter of a British baron , she has been famous ever since LIFE magazine put her on its cover more than 50 years ago , mainly for the men she has married ( Randolph Churchill , Leland Hayward , W. Averell Harriman ) or enchanted ( Giovanni Agnelli , Edward R. Murrow ) and for her peerless charm . But she has always had a fondness for France , where she spent a prewar year using the Sorbonne as a finishing school and the postwar years enjoying the company of such men as Baron Elie de Rothschild , Aly Khan and Agnelli . And she certainly possessed a prime qualification of an ambassador , having diligently raised money for the new President and his party . But most of her friends assumed that the restoration to power of her adopted Democrats meant she would , at 73 , embrace the role she had earned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . <P> This Wednesday Ambassador Harriman will formally present her credentials to French President Francois Mitterrand . Ever since she arrived in Paris four weeks ago , she has been making it very clear that hers will be a high-profile tenure . On the day she landed , after an overnight flight , she was in her office meeting senior counselors , fielding her first courtesy call and having a working dinner with her deputy chief of mission . Jet lag , anyone ? The next day she had lunch with an ambassador , gave a speech in honor of a retiring embassy employee , hosted a reception and made her own first courtesy call , to British Ambassador Sir Christopher Mallaby . <P> And so it went . Briefings , meetings with various departments of her 1,100- member staff , lunches with more ambassadors  --  and , in between , keeping up with five newspapers , CNN and the local rebroadcast of the CBS Evening News . The week she arrived , Cabinet members Lloyd Bentsen , Ron Brown and Mickey Kantor came to town for an economic summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Harriman . She also threw a luncheon at the embassy residence on the Rue du Faubourg St. Honore for former Secretary of State George Shultz . <P> Although Harriman will never be known as a deep or reflective thinker , she works earnestly at dispelling her image as a socialite and dilettante , and an invitation to her table does not mean endless rounds of wine and gossip . The Shultz lunch was typical . Douglas Warner , president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. , discussed the U.S. economy . Shultz spoke of his fears about growing protectionism . He was dying to join an animated exchange between Harriman and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing , but they were speaking in rapid-fire French , and he could n't keep up . " I enjoyed that lunch because the talk was substantive , " says Shultz . Then , after a pause , he adds , " Well , it 's true she provides the spark and the sparkle  --  and the pictures .
