<p> It has long been a truism that music is a global language . But that capacity to reach beyond speech and culture - to transport listeners to a common realm - has recently led to the dramatic growth of a new genre : world music . <p> From clubs to concert halls , on CDs and at festivals , artists from many nations are gaining new followings with fresh sounds , experimentation across cultures , and the melding of diverse traditions . <p> In the United States , the sales of world-music records have doubled in the past five years . And while world music accounts for less than 5 percent of the total market , its influence is ricocheting as never before . <p> So today , Seattle rocker Eddie Vedder and Pakistani wonder Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan weave sounds together for a movie soundtrack ( " Dead Man Walking " ) . Pop-rock veterans , such as Van Morrison and The Who , add percussionists to their groups . And musicians such as Peter Gabriel and Johnny Clegg , who helped pioneer contemporary world music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk , and jazz artists are also borrowing and branching out . And " roots " musicians , such as Bulgaria 's Folk Scat and Tibet 's Youngchen Lhamo , are gaining more exposure and respect through independent record labels and promoters . Meanwhile , melders like the duo Dead Can Dance draw upon different " international " sounds to create songs that trace back to no single place . Driving the trend are listeners and artists craving " something different . " <p> What is world music ? <p> Given the great diversity in category and style , it is not surprising there is little agreement on exactly what constitutes this genre . It could be Afro-Caribbean rhythms , Celtic fiddles , or reggae . Gregorian chants , Aborigine didgeridoo , or Tajikistani pop . Salsa , samba , or Johnny Clegg and Savuka . <p> Some musicologists argue that all music is world music . After all , rock-and-roll traces back to Africa . Record-store employees , on the other hand , will direct you to a specific section . And the Billboard charts seem to define world music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , including the Gipsy Kings ( pop flamenco from France ) , Celtic groups like Clannad ( Ireland ) and Capercaillie ( Scotland ) , and performers like Loreena McKennitt ( Canada ) who mix and meld sounds . <p> Robert Browning , artistic director of the World Music Institute in New York , describes a world-music spectrum that has emerged to define , albeit fuzzily , the genre 's reference points . On one end of the spectrum you have classical or traditional " roots " music , which commercial types might write off as esoteric ethnic . On the other end , you have dabblers and amalgamators whose music is more accessible by Western standards . <p> One tongue-in-cheek comment overheard these days in US world-music circles involves the current Macarena craze - the dance music that is showing up everywhere from the Republican Party convention to kindergartens : " Macarena - is n't it great to see a world-music song finally make No.1 ? " Many see the song as more of a fad than as a world-music milestone . <p> From ' Day-O ' to today-O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harry Belafonte introduced a calypso craze in the late 1950s singing " Day-O . " The Beatles incorporated Indian elements into some of their music . And in recent years , Paul Simon set pop melodies to South African rhythms with " Graceland " ( 1986 ) and then bowed to Brazil with " Rhythm of the Saints " ( 1990 ) . <p> Few artists , however , have done more than Peter Gabriel in exposing pop enthusiasts to world music - and its power to champion human rights . In the 1980s , Gabriel sought out some of the world 's best musicians , including Senegal 's Youssou N'Dour , and established the Real World Records as well as WOMAD ( World Organization of Music and Dance ) . <p> David Byrne must also take credit for furthering the cause with his interest in South American music , as well as Johnny Clegg who emerged from apartheid South Africa with his Zulu-inspired tunes . <p> Western music is meeting the rest of the world on many levels . Perhaps the most visible element of crossover is percussion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Best World Music Album for " Planet Drum . " More recently , he formed Mystery Box , a group that brings together some of the world 's top percussionists . <p> Victor Mendoza , a well-known Latin-jazz composer and vibraphone artist , explains that from an artistic standpoint , music from different cultures opens up doors to creativity and inspiration . " You look at your own music in a whole different way , and you 're never bored . " His fantasy , he says , is to compose an orchestral piece based on each of the Central American countries ' traditional music . " If my exposure allows for their style of music to be known better , then I 've accomplished what I was meant to do . " <p> Many musicians feel as Mendoza does that their efforts to make others ' music known are part of a larger picture , perhaps a larger mission to educate and bring people closer together . <p> As a result , they say , music fans become more open-minded and more likely to explore . Tom Wegen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , is sure of this . The size of his department has tripled in seven years . <p> Unlike a decade ago , browsers can find just about every country represented , says Mr. Wegen . Folk music from Azerbaijan ? Yeah , we 've got that . <p> " Most ' ethnic ' music is obscure , " Wegen admits : " I 'm the only one I know who likes primitive Aborigine music . " <p> But the world is getting more curious , he acknowledges , and when the likes of Gloria Estefan and the Gipsy Kings come along as chart-toppers , not to mention the Bayside Boys and their Macarena mix , interests expand . <p> One of the most visible promoters of world music of late is Putumayo , known for its globally minded retail stores that sell clothing , crafts , and now , music . The recent release " One World " is a sampler of songs that marks a more-mainstream marketing effort in the name of world music . <p> " We know there 's a lot of great music out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Putumayo World Music founder Dan Storper . With a mission of bringing melodic , upbeat songs that appeal to the sophisticated listener as well as the " beginner , " Putumayo hopes to give listeners a glimpse of the power of music to bring people together . <p> " For world music to carry to the next level , we need to develop stars and consistency , " Mr. Storper says . <p> Other companies and independent labels specializing in world music include Green Linnet 's Xenophile , Ellipsis Arts , Nomad ( Music of the World ) , Sanachie , Intersound , Rounder Records , Rykodisc , and more . <p> Larger record companies such as EMI 's " Hemisphere " label are branching out , too . <p> Educators go beyond Bach <p> In the classroom , Berklee College of Music in Boston is testimony to a greater interest in world music . Today the school offers 27 world music courses , from " African Pop Ensemble " to " Brazilian Musical Styles , " compared with six in 1991 . This year , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand percussion , and it recently sponsored the Berklee College of Music 's World Percussion Festival , drawing musicians from Sweden to South America . <p> Preservation , evolution <p> Mr. Browning , of the World Music Institute , has had a finger on the pulse of world music for almost 20 years , and has watched interest increase " dramatically " - particularly in New York . <p> Growing immigrant populations tend to have an interest in their " national " music , whether it was classical or popular , Browning explains . So it follows that you could hold a Persian music concert at Lincoln Center and get a crowd of 2,000 . " Many would n't have gone in India , but here they gather for national identity . " Now , the general public seems to not only be open to but also willing to hook into world music . The Throat Singers of Tuva , from Siberia , for example , attracted remarkable attention , he says . <p> While the trendiness of world music can be good , Browning says , he cautions that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " One fears the demise of traditional music . " The so-called New Age movement for a while posed a grave threat to traditional music , he adds , watering it down and disguising it . Experiment is great , and crossover is important , but it must be done in good faith . Things seem to be swinging back . " I see evidence of music moving away from the melting pot to a more multicultural identity . " <p> Andrew Sidenfeld , founder of the world-music promotion company " No Problem Productions , " suggests yet another impulse for the current surge in pop-world-music popularity . It is partly due , he says , to people bucking the mainstream music-industry control . <p> " The power is falling into fewer and fewer hands ... What we hear now is more and more formulaic , and people are fed up with the **25;340;TOOLONG approach what will make a hit , what will sell . The rise of world music is a reaction against that . When you give people fewer and fewer choices , they want to explore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curious about world music , but do n't know where to start ? Tom Weden , buyer of world music for Tower Records in Boston , suggests some releases : <p> One World ( Putumayo ) : Good starter kit featuring major world-music artists . <p> Cesaria vora - ( Nonesuch ) : Self-titled CD from the Cape Verdean songstress . <p> The Best of Thomas Mapfumo - Chimurenga Forever ( Hemisphere ) : This musician from Zimbabwe serves up traditional music with a modern twist spanning 1978-1993 . <p> Beleza Tropical ( Luaka Bop/Warner Bros . ) : Classic Brazilian pop-music tracks , compiled by David Byrne . <p> Global Divas - Voices From Women of the World ( Rounder ) : Giants in their field . <p> Jesus Alemany 's - Cubanismo !
