// Simple strategies and tasty recipes to help you recharge your life Does this sound familiar ? You eat a healthful breakfast , but by midmorning you 've got the shakes so bad you 're ready to lunge at the first glazed donut you see . Then , after eating a pasta salad for lunch , you can barely resist the desire to lay your head on your desk and take a little nap . There 's probably nothing wrong with your health , but you should examine your eating patterns . It may be less a matter of what you 're eating than of how much you 're eating and when . Here are three simple diet strategies that will allow you to soar past those energy slumps and keep you on an even keel throughout the day . Square One : Breakfast It turns out Mom , the school nurse and your home-ec teacher were right : Breakfast is the most important meal of the day . The type of foods you eat to break the overnight fast set up your metabolic pace for the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proteins in this meal are important to consider since these nutrients are what set off the chemical messengers that get-and keep-your engines humming . Carbohydrates trigger the release of insulin , the hormone that allows glucose ( blood sugar ) to be moved into cells , where it is either used as energy or stored as fat . A very high carbohydrate mealsay , a glass of orange juice and cereal with a banana-may be loaded with nutrients , but it 's not the best combination first thing in the morning , because it can result in an episode of low blood sugar a few hours later . This is a perfectly normal response . When you consume a relatively large amount of easily digested carbohydrates ( with very little fat and fiber to slow it down ) , the carbs are rapidly absorbed , causing a big release of insulin . In healthy people who react normally to insulin , the rush of that hormone may actually clear sugar from the blood a little too well , causing a dip in blood sugar levels . The body then responds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to release glucose into the blood . And it 's the body 's natural fight-or-flight reaction to the adrenaline that produces those shaky , hungry feelings . The solution is to eat a breakfast with a proper balance of protein , carbs and fat . For example , a slice of whole-wheat toast with a tablespoon of natural peanut butter and a whole orange is more likely to sustain your energy throughout the morning than just cereal and fruit . For one thing , this meal takes longer to digest because of the protein , fat and fiber ; for another , the relatively lower amount of carbs means the insulin response will be lower and thus the blood sugar levels steadier . If you prefer to start the morning with a nutritious highcarb fruit smoothie , you can increase the protein and fat content by adding healthful ingredients like soy protein isolate powder and flaxseed oil or crushed flaxseeds . Brain Power The protein and carbohydrate balance of a meal also affects levels of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters ( like serotonin and catecholamines ) , which in turn influence energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release of feel-good serotonin , which keeps you focused and relaxed ; a high-protein meal releases catecholamines , which enhances alertness . And because the first meal of the day sets the tone for the rest of the day , a reasonable amount of protein ( 15 percent to 20 percent of the meal 's calories ) not only lets you start the day feeling energized but helps avoid the afterlunch crash . This is not to say that a high-protein diet is the key to high energy . Like everything in life , there 's a need for balance . If , for example , you are getting ready for a job interview , a speaking engagement or any situation that calls for thinking on your feet and being alert , you might prepare by having a soy burger that 's high in protein ( hold the bun ) and a salad . But when you want to relax or lift flagging spirits , a large serving of your favorite pasta dish and a light , fruity dessert will do the trick . The Benefits of Grazing For many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain stamina throughout the day . Energy levels do not rise and fall as dramatically when there is a slow , steady influx of proteins , fat and carbohydrates . Grazing spreads out the demanding work the body has to do to digest , transport and store nutrients when you 're not eating . It can also balance out extreme highs and lows in blood sugar and blood fat levels , putting less stress on the body 's metabolic machinery , which is healthier in and of itself . In fact , large studies like the Baltimore Longitudinal Health Study suggest that people who eat frequent small meals have lower cholesterol and a healthier distribution of body fat than people who restrict their eating to three meals . The terms grazing and snacking are often used interchangeably but snacking does not give license to indulge in junk foods . The same rules of a healthful diet apply here Eat plant-based whole foods and keep refined , processed foods to a minimum . And along with small , frequent meals , try short , frequent walks . ( There 's nothing wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick with . ) Exercise is key for energy , alertness and releasing those feel-good natural chemicals .
