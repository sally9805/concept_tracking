TITLE : DISNEY 'S SYMPHONIC FANTASY <P> WHERE : METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE , NEW YORK CITY <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : A revue of songs from Disney movies is pleasant if uninspired . <P> The ever expanding Walt Disney Co. , having announced plans for a West Coast Epcot Center and a Broadway Beauty and the Beast , has now unveiled a touring stage revue of songs from its animated movies . The show opened a two-week run last week at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House , no less , and will go on to play 17 amphitheaters , arts centers and state fairs through Aug. 22 . A lavish affair , it is performed by a symphony orchestra , a 30-member chorus , and 44 players who impersonate more than 200 Disney characters . Alas , the title  --  Disney 's Symphonic Fantasy  --  is only two-thirds accurate . <P> The Boston Pops treatment suits the Disney catalog , which boasts six Oscar winners , from When You Wish upon a Star ( Pinocchio ) through Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah ( Song of the South ) to A Whole New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right down to the tiny red bow on Minnie Mouse 's knickers . The oversize character heads bring coos of recognition from the littlest audience members . And the numbers are neatly sung and danced . <P> What the show lacks is fantasy , the magic of the movie originals . The two hours are pleasant enough , but the energetic staging  --  all of it in a shallow strip in front of the orchestra  --  is uninspired . Without distinctive personalities or any sense of drama , a sameness sets in . <P> The Met engagement is blessed , however , with the crisp , lush American Symphony Orchestra , founded by Leopold Stokowski , who conducted 1940 's Fantasia . A different local symphony will play at each stop , one of the nicer goals of the enterprise being to increase appreciation for the nation 's orchestras . Stoky would have liked that .
