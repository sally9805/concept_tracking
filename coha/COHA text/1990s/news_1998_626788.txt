<p> YOU ca n't say " the tube " and mean only the television set anymore . <p> KTBU-TV , Channel 55 - which has branded itself The Tube - was scheduled to sign on at 6 a.m. today with a devotional , becoming Houston 's 18th television station and the nation 's last possible UHF station to launch . <p> But a power pole toppled onto the station on Old Katy Road during Tuesday afternoon 's thunderstorm , and officials were scrambling to find a backup power source . Nevertheless , a station executive said , " We will be on the air Wednesday . " <p> The Tube will premiere as one of television 's rarest forms - a general-entertainment independent station . Houston is especially unusual in having two of this vanishing breed , the other being KNWS-TV , Channel 51 . <p> Most stations today belong to a network and take advantage of the promotional and advertising potential of mass marketing . As a true independent , Channel 55 is forgoing those advantages , along with network obligations , so that it can run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to . <p> Channel 55 president Joel Osteen , a fledgling broadcaster , has chosen to enter the crowded field of so-called " family entertainment . " <p> His competition in this loosely named category could include every broadcaster but more narrowly involves stations running TVG-rated programs almost exclusively . Currently those competitors are Channel 51 and the cable network Nickelodeon . In August , Fox Family Channel ( a reformatted Family Channel ) and local Channel 49 ( also reformatted ) will enter the fray . <p> " We 're as clean and family-oriented a station as there is in the market , and that will always be the focus of this station , " said Matt Reiff , 41 , station manager of The Tube . " We 're not going to run what we consider questionable programming . We 're not going to put on something in order to generate ratings . You 're not going to see oddball talk shows or real-life cop shoot-'em-ups . " <p> Entertainment programming will run 6 a.m. -1 a.m. weekdays . Infomercials will air in the wee hours . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House on the Prairie , " " Happy Days , " " Gunsmoke , " " Who 's the Boss ? , " " Hogan 's Heroes , " " The Lucy Show , " " Have Gun Will Travel , " " The Rifleman , " " Family Ties , " " The Untouchables " and " The Wild , Wild West . " <p> The station has the last noncable run of " Star Trek " and a three-year pact to present " Star Trek : The Next Generation . " In September , " The Little Rascals , " " The Donna Reed Show , " " The Flying Nun " and " Gidget " will be added . <p> " We 're also careful about the movies we choose , " said Wendell Burton , who oversees programming and is national sales manager of The Tube . " Just because it 's for the family does n't mean it has to be boring . We think it can be exciting and a lot of fun . Some of the titles we may show late Saturday night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're going to go for the hippest movies we can get . " <p> Those include " A Man Called Horse , " " Tender Mercies , " " Cool Hand Luke , " the Perry Mason TV films and " Bullitt " - 14 movies a week in all . <p> Channel 55 " is going to be fun , wholesome and entertaining , " said Osteen , 35 . " There 's going to be quality and value . People are going to enjoy themselves . " <p> Osteen 's faith and money are behind the venture , which already has a lengthy history . The Rev. Charles Johnson and his son , the Rev. Dowan Johnson , applied for the Channel 55 license in 1980 but won it only recently . The length of that heated battle , combined with limits on available bandwidths , means KTBU-TV will be the last UHF station in the country to take to the airwaves . <p> The Johnsons , both of Conroe , are partners with Joel Osteen and his wife , Victoria . <p> Neither Osteen 's father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially involved in the operation . Joel Osteen is running the station as president , and the money he brought to the station " came out of a bank , " said a knowledgeable source . <p> Osteen 's previous television experience is primarily as producer of his father 's church broadcast . But he did not enter the business without researching the Houston market , then carefully selecting a team to help him . They include Burton , former advertising director for the Family Channel , and Reiff , who has extensive experience with the local TV sales market . The station has 35 employees , including nine part-timers . <p> " Faith and trust in the Lord has been a factor " in getting the station off the ground , Osteen said . " Many times it 's looked impossible - so much to do and so many obstacles to overcome . Sometimes you use faith looking for the right people , the right decision . " <p> John Osteen 's church ministry is moving Sunday from Channel 11 to The Tube , along with several other local church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.m. - noon and 10 p.m. - midnight . A daily dose of religion will be observed at 6 a.m. weekdays with Joyce Meyer 's " Life in the Word " and at 6:30 a.m. with La Marque minister Walter Hallam . <p> " The story behind ( his father 's broadcast moving ) is Channel 11 is going to football , " said the younger Osteen . <p> The trend in broadcasting has been that stations with network affiliations have forgone religion shows , including church services , in order to present local news and to keep network commitments . Osteen said picking up his father 's broadcast is " another good opportunity for us . " <p> " Another reason I was interested in the station was if somebody wanted , we could provide an outlet for religious broadcasters . We 've had overwhelming response because we 've all been moved around ( on station schedules ) , " he said . <p> " Nothing against those other stations - they 're doing what somebody else is telling them to do . But the guarantee that my church will have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenal thing . And to put it on a general-entertainment station , so that the whole market can watch , that 's what 's so exciting for us , that it 's going to be on The Tube and it 's not on at 5 o'clock in the morning . " <p> Channel 55 's principals are Christians , but they say they do not have a religious or right-wing agenda . <p> " We 're not here to change the world , " said Reiff . " Happy Days " is " Happy Days . " " Gunsmoke 's " " Gunsmoke . " We 'll fulfill our public-affairs obligations for a license . We 're in the entertainment business , and that 's all we want to do . We do n't have an agenda . <p> " Do we want to maintain an image that the family is going to be happy with and not be concerned about program content ? Yeah . That does n't necessarily dictate any type of religion ; that 's just a position . " <p> Would the station accept advertising for alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wine or alcohol commercials , " said Don Iloff , vice president of marketing and communication and Joel Osteen 's brother-in-law . But many sports shows come to local stations partially sold , often with beer ads . Should they come Channel 55 's way , Iloff said , " we would accept them reluctantly . " <p> The station kicks off with the most advanced marketing campaign ever for a local station . The smart ad slogan " Turn on The Tube " starts appearing today on billboards and , with a catchy jingle , on radio and television . <p> The station 's inspired idea to brand itself The Tube gives it distance from the clutter of other stations ' channel numbers and call letters and positions it on the playing field of Nickelodeon 's Nick at Nite . <p> It is the Nick audience , 18- to 49-year-olds , that The Tube wishes to attract . <p> " We feel like you only have one chance to make a good impression , " Osteen said . " We have a lot of work to do still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nite in the quality sense , that 's fantastic for us . " <p> They like their chances for success . <p> " I think our chances are good , " said Osteen . " We 've got a good team , the market 's strong , and we 've got a good-quality product and such good response . " <p> " Expectations are important , " said Iloff , " but for all practical purposes , we are an upstart station . I think if you took a survey , it 'd tell you that six months from now , we should be all infomercials . Six months from now , you should see nothing but the smoke from our smoldering ashes . <p> " But that 's not going to happen . " <p> <p> Channel 55 weekday lineup <p> It will take about 45 days before Channel 55 shows up on major cable systems . Until then , cable subscribers must disconnect their cable to see it . <p> The station 's lineup should appear in the Houston Chronicle beginning Aug. 9 . <p> The Monday-Friday lineup : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 6:30 a.m .
