Bald Head Island enchants you before you ever set foot there . It starts when you board the ferry from the mainland in Southport , North Carolina , and notice the vessel 's name as you clamber aboard : Sans Souci . It 's French for " without a care . " You 're about to understand why . A boat is the only way to reach this barrier island about 25 miles south of Wilmington . On the map , Bald Head looks like a little jigsaw-puzzle piece . The 20-minute boat ride adds to the romantic notion of getting away from it all . You do n't drive to Bald Head Island . Instead , you 're taken there . Prior to your departure , your bags are loaded on board the boat at Indigo Plantation and Marina , the small , sheltered harbor . You notice passengers with ice chests , bags of groceries , boxes , and suitcases . They 've come to spend several weeks-or the entire summer . Lucky them . Lucky you too . The diesel engines gurgle deep and low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cape Fear River which broadens to a brackish sea as it empties into the Atlantic . Screeching gulls fly close behind , then veer oft as the captain increases the throttle . The wind whips your hair , the sun warms your face , and you squint against the late afternoon glare of silvery waves , trying to pinpoint your destination . Before long , it comes into view-a-a thin slice of land on the horizon . Photograph // The boat slows and approaches the narrow entrance to the protected harbor . You see the stubby profile of the island 's lighthouse , Old Baldy , and the little pyramids and rectangles of houses . Once the Saiiis Soitci docks , passengers scramble down the boardwalk and gather their loot . Most of them slip into golf carts , some hop on bikes ; others amble over to the market . You recall what the brochure mentioned : No cars allowed . That 's nice . You climb into an electric tram that whisks you away to your lodging , the Marsh Harbour Inn , one of two bedand-breakfasts ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors ) . There are no motels or hotels , no fast-food restaurants either . They would look out of place , an intrusion on the cozy village atmosphere . So what can you do ? Lots of things , and lots of nothings , depending on your curiosity and energy level . Energy low ? Sit in a rocking chair on the front porch with a good book , lifting your eyes up now and then to watch boats come and go in the harbor . A bit more adventurous ? Hop in the electric cart and scoot around on the paved paths on the island 's south end . The relatively small , developed area is easy to get around on a bike or a cart . Drop in at the market for a snack and some liquid refreshment , and then you 're on your way . Recommended first stop ? Old Baldy , the picturesque lighthouse . Its beam no longer shines a warning to ships rounding Cape Fear ; Oak Island 's lighthouse does that now . Step inside and climb up the wooden steps ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , the cupola rewards you with a panoramic view . You get a gullseye look at the harbor . Below you is the salt marsh , a green , grassy prairie cut with rivulets of water . You spy brightly colored kayaks snaking along the narrow waters and smile in anticipation of your kayak tour tomorrow morning . Next , visit the beautiful island sanctuary beside the lighthouse . Slip in for a quiet moment in the Village Chapel , and then wander around the grounds . Head east on the cart path from the village to the Maritime Forest Preserve , where moss-curtained live oaks play peekaboo with the sun . As with the salt marshes and pristine beaches , the forest is a precious link in the delicate ecology . Walk along the Kent Mitchell Nature Trail , which leads through the woods and along the marsh . At the cart path 's end on the southeastern shore sits the headquarters , gift shop , and activity center for the Bald Head Island Conservancy , a group devoted to protecting the island 's resources . Check the bulletin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightly during the nesting season , from the first full moon in June until August ) . Now you 'll want to return to the inn , relax a bit , and maybe stop in at that little shop , The Lightkeeper , facing the harbor . Then it 's time for dinner . Dig into the boiled shrimp while you sit out on the deck at Eb and Flo 's Steambar , a casual restaurant perched along the dock . Afterwards , you and your special someone manage to make it to the beach as the sun sets . You walk arm in arm , enchanted by the soughing waves and a soft breeze . The darkening sky reveals the night 's first diamond : Oak Island 's lighthouse winks across the Cape Fear River . What 's up for tomorrow ? There 's the kayak tour , then maybe a round of golf , some tennis , or even croquet . Leave plenty of time for doing nothing . Remember the name of the ferry that brought you to Bald Head ?
