<p> AUSTIN - After two decades of decline and a near-rout in last year 's elections , Texas Democrats are hoping 1996 will be the year they strike back against Republican gains in state and local elective offices . <p> In their campaign to turn the tide , the state Democratic Party leadership on Saturday was expected to elect a new battlefield general - Houston lawyer Bill White - as interim party chairman . <p> " " Our principal priorities in Texas will be to keep the ( state ) House , keep the Senate and pick up at least one congressional seat , " White said of his goal to begin what he describes as the rebirth of the Texas Democratic Party . <p> " " If we succeed , it will have taken the wind out of the Republicans ' realignment plans , " White said . <p> But this Democratic renewal effort will involve more than the election of a new state party chairman and reorganization of the party headquarters . <p> Many of the party 's elected and intellectual leadership elite are gathering around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying to develop a focused , pocket-book message and grassroots effort to restore pride and enthusiasm to Democratic activists . <p> The Texas chapter of the Democratic Leadership Council , a conservative think tank oriented to elected officials , also plans in February to release " " a centrist public policy agenda to carry Texas Democrats into the 21st century . " The timing coincides with a convention in Houston that will feature a roast of former Gov . Ann Richards . <p> And on the legislative front , Senate Democrats are organizing to hold onto their slim two-vote majority in the 31-member body . House Democrats are trying for the first time to stem attacks on Democratic incumbents by the Associated Republicans of Texas and the House Republican Caucus . <p> When former Texas Democratic Party Chairman Bob Slagle was first elected in 1980 , Republicans held only 215 elective offices out of about 5,000 available statewide . <p> An influx of Anglo Republican residents and rapidly growing suburban communities during the 1980s combined with Democratic misfortunes helped change all that . <p> Republicans now hold 1,110 elective offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office , all three seats on the Texas Railroad Commission and an overwhelming majority of the Texas Supreme Court . <p> The GOP is poised to gain majority control of Texas ' state government and congressional delegation by the turn of the century . <p> When Slagle announced in May that he would retire as chairman in 1996 , Democratic leaders immediately began looking for someone who could reinvent their party . <p> A rally to White began in September after five statewide elected officials endorsed White 's candidacy and demanded Slagle resign immediately so a new chairman would be in place before the 1996 elections . <p> White , 41 , cut his political teeth in the 1970s as an aide to then U.S. Rep. Bob Krueger , D-New Braunfels . <p> Political opening <p> As an oil and gas trial attorney in Houston , White raised $ 2 million for President Clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign , an effort that paid off with White 's appointment as deputy secretary of energy . He resigned his federal post last summer to campaign for Texas Democratic Party chairman . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , White was expected to be elected by acclamation as interim chairman Saturday by the State Democratic Executive Committee meeting in Austin . White 's election to a full two-year term as chairman would be up to the Democratic State Convention next June . <p> " " I want to use this as a vehicle for grassroots organizing , " White said , listing several goals for party workers over the next six months : <p> Mail out 15,000 letters to Democratic activists asking them to host coffees at their homes for party organizing activities or so a candidate can speak . They also will be urged to register a certain number of new voters and contact registered likely Democratic voters who have not been participating in recent elections . <p> Reorganize and update the party 's computerized voter identification data base . White said he wants Democratic candidates at all levels to have ready access to lists of voters in their district who are likely to support them . <p> He plans to hire an Austin pollster to survey 2,500 to 3,000 Democratic elected officials about what services they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be resurveyed next December to see if the party met their needs . <p> White also plans to open a satellite state Democratic Party headquarters office in East Texas . <p> He said he wants to keep the 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts in the Democratic column , a task made more difficult with the departure of U.S. Reps . Jim Chapman of Sulphur Springs and Charlie Wilson of Lufkin . And White wants to retake the 9th District seat now held by Republican Steve Stockman of Friendswood . <p> East Texas battleground <p> " " East Texas is going to be a battleground , " White said . " " I believe East Texas is where the so-called Republican realignment will stop . " <p> With well-funded quality candidates , the Democrats should be able to hold the 1st and 2nd Districts , and they should have a good chance of defeating Stockman . <p> All three districts favored Clinton in the 1992 election , and only the 1st District voted Republican in the 1988 presidential election . While each district gave arch-conservative Republican U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm 55 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that year also delivered 55 percent or more of the vote to former Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower , a liberal who lost statewide to Republican Rick Perry . <p> Even in the 1994 rout , Democrats in the 1st and 2nd Districts could take heart in the fact that Democrats were winning easily down ballot although Democrats at the top of the ticket were losing . <p> Stockman 's surprise victory over long-time 9th District U.S. Rep. Jack Brooks was more a reflection of Democratic lethargy than Republican gain . Brooks defeated Stockman in 1992 with 55 percent of the vote , only to lose two years later . But 62,000 fewer voters turned out in 1994 than 1992 , and more than 47,000 of those votes dropped out of Brooks ' victory column . <p> White 's strategy was called " " defeatist " by Republican political consultant Karl Rove . " " They 're not talking about advancing . They 're talking about cutting their losses , " he said . " " This would be a disaster if out of his five goals they lose two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White 's strategy about taking away from the Republicans the Railroad Commission or state Supreme Court seats that are up next year . <p> " " It 's a plan to defend one very small geographic portion of the state , " Rove said . <p> Rove said the Democrats ' real problems in Texas have little to do with party services or voter identification lists . He said Democratic activists are unmotivated by a party that is ideologically adrift . <p> Rove said the Democratic Party has declined " " as the party of ideas and progress and forward thinking , a forward-thinking movement for America 's middle class . " Because of that , he said , the party has lost its hold on its own grassroots movement . <p> " " Simply changing the chairman of the party is n't going to change that . They are going to be stuck with who they are until somebody changes who they are , " Rove said . <p> 21st century Democrats <p> Enter the 21st century Democrats , whose mission is to develop that pocket-book message . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gutow . Its policy committee ranges from members of the Johnson administration to current state legislators to the key political aides of Lt. Gov . Bob Bullock and Comptroller John Sharp . <p> " " To be a political party , you have got to have an economic message , " Gutow said . " " We can not have an economic message and it be tax and spend . " <p> Gutow said his organization is developing a Democratic economic policy statement designed to appeal to the middle-class and the working poor . <p> He said it will focus on issues such as jobs , an increase in the minimum wage , quality education , aid for youth who want to go to college , affordable housing and guaranteed health care . <p> " " The Democrats have an economic message , and it 's different from the Republicans , " Gutow said . " " The problem with our party is it ca n't seem to fasten on a strong , singular idea and say , ' This is what we stand for . ' " " <p> Gutow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on March 12 and then later to state senatorial district conventions and ultimately to the state convention next year . <p> Pushing the positives <p> Organization members also will be urged to hold meetings and contact their friends and acquaintances to tell them positive things about the Democratic Party instead of just the negatives promoted by Republicans . <p> " " The idea of this organization is to refocus the regulars and add to that an energy in building an army of Democrats who feel very good and comfortable about walking into a room and saying ' I 'm a Democrat and let me tell you what we 're doing , ' " Gutow said . <p> In the state Legislature , Democrats are gearing up like they never have before to maintain their majorities in the House and Senate . <p> Rep. Tom Craddick , R-Midland , is heading up the Republican effort to take control . He said gaining the last dozen seats the GOP needs to control the House and the final two it needs for a majority in the Senate next year will be difficult but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along in the candidate recruitment process and the campaign strategy process than we ever have been in the state of Texas , " he said . <p> But Rep. Keith Oakley , D-Terrell , said the Democrats this year are going to play by a different set of rules . " " Historically it was just an unwritten rule that you did n't go into another member 's district . Republican , Democrat , you just did n't get involved in an incumbent race , " Oakley said . <p> But for the last three election cycles the Republicans have been doing just that , he said , knocking off one Democratic incumbent after another . Oakley said this year the House Democratic Caucus is raising money and developing campaign strategies for incumbents who are challenged by Republicans . <p> The Democrats want " " to try to get some real help to candidates , basically the kind of things the Republican Party has been doing , " Oakley said . " " Instead of just handing a check to a Democratic candidate , we want to actually get them some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oakley said he also believes the Republicans missed out by not challenging more incumbent Democrats during the rout of 1994 . <p> He said 1996 should be a Democratic come-back year . <p> " " They 're behind the curve , " Oakley said . " " If they 'd been real , <p> real organized and had good candidates against each of us Democrats last time , they could have kicked ( us ) bad . "
