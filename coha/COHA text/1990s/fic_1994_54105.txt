Getting ready for company , I gathered my hair into a loose braid . I was too old for so much hair , but I could n't bear to cut it . The plait was a compromise . I felt festive , blessed because of the evening ahead . I 'd put on a long gored skirt which I liked a lot , two muted shades of smoky blue , and a V-necked blouse and sandals . Ben , my broad-faced black Sandyland Labrador , had settled at my feet , and out the window past the dressing table I could see my peach trees heavy with fruit . <p> I reddened my cheeks and lips , joyous at the notion that I could now have my friends over whenever I liked . on the spur of the moment , for fresh peaches , to rock on the front porch . I could have my partner Katie and my lover Will , and my oldest friend in the world , Harriet , to my house . What a marvel : to meld the parts of my life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had compartmentalized . How it had fostered gender-distinct , function-distinct , affection-distinct divisions . I was expanding into widowhood . <p> Harriet , after a long soak in the tub , came out of the bathroom in her bra and panties , and I saw she was much thinner than she looked in clothes . She wanted me to help her decide what to wear . " I bought these two-tone slingbacks . Look . " She held them up . " What do they remind you of ? Are n't they the absolute echo of the saddle oxfords we wore at Miss Pritchard 's ? I could n't resist them , even though they cost an arm and a leg . Well , okay , an elbow and a knee . I thought I 'd wear them with this white pique . " She glanced at me , holding up what looked like a brief tennis dress . <p> Harriet was visiting me here in the Blue Ridge Mountains of South Carolina from the piney woods of east Texas for the very first time without my having to say goodnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to settle her in and then close the door on whatever room Nolan and I were sharing when guests were in the house . I could recall the strain of lying there in the dark , first in one bed , later in two , exchanging heated words  --  Nolan , having had a good deal to drink , needing to comment on how Harriet had talked too much as usual , or to inquire how long she was staying this time . Some jealous words which caused that tightening of the stomach that went with the divided loyalties of a married woman 's life : husband and children , husband and friends . <p> " The world seems less user-friendly , " Harriet said , brushing her shiny pageboy , " since Knox died . I guess I feel I 've lost my job . Wife . I 'm unemployed . What about you , Sarah ? " <p> " I 'm getting used to it , " I said . In truth , I had mixed feelings . Nolan and I , who had begun in such heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I was still sorry . It was disheartening to lose someone before you had the chance to make things right , to go back and take a different path . Although the fault , I thought , was not his  --  I gave him that  --  nor even , I wanted to believe , mine , but rather that of the encasement we had coexisted in : marriage . <p> " You had time to get used to his going , " Harriet said . <p> " Yes . " It was true . I 'd done most of my mourning first . The bad prognosis  --  cancer of the pancreas  --  had come the middle of February ; then , while my children and I were trying to get used to the idea , talking to Nolan 's doctor , Harriet 's husband Knox had wrapped himself around a hickory tree on a curve he 'd taken drunk or sober for thirty years . We had all been stunned , numbed by the suddenness . <p> Harriet , who did n't like to stay too long on gloomy topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think about it , incredible really , how the two of us have always done everything at the same time ? I mean , gone off to boarding school at Miss Pritchard 's , dated those cadets named Stewart with an e and Stuart with a u , been in each other 's weddings , married bankers , had our boys and then our girls the same years , got separate bedrooms at the same time . You even got your tubes tied when I had my hysterectomy . Now , imagine , both of us widows . It gives me the goosebumps , things working out this way . " <p> " I think about it , too , " I said , looking out at my trees . Thinking that perhaps what made for close friends , after all , was someone who had gone down the same road with you , who 'd made the same steps along the way . Grateful that Harriet had walked my lifeline with me for forty years . <p> " Oh , Sarah , can you believe we 're about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know this probably is n't all right to say , so soon and all  --  but I 'm so excited to be here . I 'm so thrilled that it will be the two of us again . Just like old times . " <p> I 'd been as eager for Harriet 's arrival as she , yet dreading it at the same time . I 'd been afraid of what I would see when she stepped off the plane in the Greenville airport , fatigued from transferring in Atlanta . Afraid I would see what I did not want to see . <p> Will had talked to me about her , trying to prepare me . He 'd looked at my notes , and then had tucked my drawing of Harriet 's chest with its tiny dried fruit and bow-tied heart into his wallet . That was two months ago . Since then , we 'd not said much about the small-celled tumor . I 'd asked him why radiation and not chemotherapy ; he 'd said because my friend was not going to make it anyway , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little else to ask . " You ca n't call it absolutely , " he 'd said . " Sometimes I 'll be standing there staring down at some face in IGU and I 'm asking myself , What are you doing here ? And I 'm reminding myself who 's around the corner and down the hall , and who 's on another floor . But there I am , talking to what seems to me to be deaf ears , nobody at home , eyes rolled back in the head . Then the patient will open his eyes and say , You 'll get fallen arches standing all night on your feet , Doc , ' or she 'll raise her head , put on a flirty smile , and say , You 're putting on weight , Will , ' and I 'll know life has kicked back in . " <p> " You look wonderful , " I told Harriet . And she did , jaunty in the short white dress cut inches over her knees , her prize Betty Grable legs above the slingbacks . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west less drawn than the last time I saw her . What if Will was wrong ? What if it really had shrunk away , the small-celled tumor , the currents radiating it to a tiny dried prune of no consequence ? <p> On the drive from the airport , it had taken me a few minutes to register that she was n't smoking . A few minutes to notice the absence of motion , the cigarette pack appearing from her handbag , the automatic flick of her lighter . It must be hard , I thought , looking at her now , to lose such a longtime habit when she most needed it . <p> " I think it 's great of you to have your friends over to see me , " she said , turning to check in the mirror how she looked from the back , " but next time I think we ought to do something just us , to celebrate that we are single now , you know ? Something with just women ? That 's what I 'm going to do , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me in the fall . I 'm going to have an old-timey luncheon , with flowers and cloth napkins at card tables . And maybe even little prizes . A number under your plate and the package wrapped and placed under the table ? The way we did when we were first married , remember ? Back when we were trying to be grown-up women having bridge parties . The absolute dark ages . Antebellum , several bellums for that matter . " <p> I did n't know quite what to say about my supper guests . Will Perry had been coming to the house for almost as many years as Harriet , although in a different context . There 'd been the strain of keeping us dog friends only  --  his Missoula was a litter-mate of Ben 's  --  with an occasional off-the-record comment , an unveiling of some private part of our lives . Me revealing the confining nature of the married state , him confessing from time to time that he was tempted to try it again . But with us both aware always that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's behest ; that he was Nolan 's doctor . <p> An even greater pleasure was in having Katie , my partner , to what was now my house for a company meal . Katie , who had years ago helped me prepare for more than a dozen parties , but who had never attended one here before . <p> Inviting her had been a bitter point between Nolan and me . <p> " How can I not have my partner ? " I 'd asked him . <p> " This is in no way racist , Sarah , " he 'd responded , on the defensive , " not with today 's tricolored bank employees . You can hardly say I 'm prejudiced . But right there 's the key word : employee . This is a party for our friends , for clients . " <p> " Katie Pegues is not an employee , " I 'd countered , deeply angry . " our account for ROOMS OF ONE 'S OWN is with your bank ; half of our wallpaper customers are yours as well . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the people who remember  --  we 're talking long memories here  --  she used to be an employee . I 'm talking maid . Do her a favor , your friend , OK ? Do her a favor so some drunk vice president does n't hand her his empty glass , OK ? " He 'd been proud of that line of reasoning  --  standing there knotting his rep tie , checking his Swiss watch . It was to spare Katie , Katie whom he would not have recognized if he 'd seen her on the street . <p> It did no good to say she 'd never been a maid , she 'd been a party service . Did he ask the bank caterer to come ? Did I want to include the German woman who baked for parties ? He would not budge . <p> Harriet raised her arms to clip a white velvet bow on her smooth hair , but the gesture of lifting her arms to secure the ribbon seemed to hurt and for a moment she froze , sucking in her breath . " ouch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She finished fixing the bow and hugged her rib cage . " I think these coughing fits tear something loose . They 're bound to . I imagine it like  --  " she winced , paused , taking a shallow breath  --  " the inside of some sound system with a couple of wires pulled loose . Not that they have wires anymore . But then , I was made in the old days . " <p> I asked , " Are you all right ? Would you like a glass of wine , a little gin ? Something ? " <p> " Something chocolate ? " Harriet perked up . <p> I fished a Hershey 's chocolate almond bar from my handbag , pleased I 'd thought to buy it in the airport . " I did n't have time to make anything , " I said , " but I got you this . " <p> " Yum . " Harriet unwrapped it instantly . " Are n't you an angel . You know I 'm a freak for chocolate . " <p> I could hear a squeak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be with your friend . Leave the medicine to Will . I reminded myself that even he left it behind him off duty . That he walked the dogs , read his mysteries , toweled me dry . That he did n't try to diagnose everybody he ran into at the dairy counter at Bi-Lo . <p> Harriet pushed me off the slipper chair at the dressing table and sat down to do her face . I stood watching as the roses returned to her cheeks , the flush to her brow . Makeup was misleading ; Harriet now looked so vivid , so rested , so well . " I did n't mean to be telling you who to invite to your house , " she said , looking at my reflection . " It 's just  --  you do n't have somebody over who took care of your husband , not at something like this , a little dinner . I do n't care what 's going on with you two , you and the old doctor . It 's like asking the rector , who , at lowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Really . I mean it looks like you 're asking for special treatment . " She turned on the stool . " And her , that girl . You just do n't have somebody you work with . They 're like the odd Couple Who Came to Dinner , is how it looks to me . " <p> I expected a bit of a skirmish between " that girl , " as Harriet always referred to Katie , and " that woman , " as Katie called any female she viewed as only a housewife . Some resistance on their parts to being lumped together , each so threatening to the other on general principles . But I trusted their affection for me , and mine for them , to smooth things out . And I knew that Will would welcome the chance to look after us all , and would not mind for a minute being outnumbered three to one . " They 're my friends , " I told her . <p> " Besides , " Harriet added , anxious , " being a doctor , he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I laughed . " That would hardly be a first , now would it ? " <p> Will came in the back way , leaving Missoula with Ben to run about in the shady backyard . He kissed me on the mouth and ran his hands down my back . " What 's for supper ? " he said . <p> " I have n't seen you two going at it before , " Katie told him . " You look right nice . " Slender , a deep cafe au lait , she perched on a stool , watching the cooking , wearing a long black-and-brown wraparound skirt tied up on one hip like a sarong , high wedge sandals , and a black tee . <p> Will took off his jacket and hung it on the back of a chair , giving Katie a pat on the shoulder by way of greeting . " Man comes in the kitchen , I 've read the literature , he 's supposed to kiss the woman and ask , What 's for supper ? ' " He helped himself to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's supposed to lift the lid off the iron skillet and say stew . ' " I was flushed from the heat of the stove-and the joy of having these two mingling with the smell of supper . I 'd made my favorite dish . I 'd baked a pork roast with cumin and thyme and black pepper , soaked red , white , and black beans and then thrown them in , adding potatoes , red and yellow bell peppers , and a turnip for flavor . While Harriet had napped earlier , after her flight , propped on three pillows , the sound of her breathing filling the room , I 'd cut up the meat and potatoes , added the juice and beans and peppers , tasted the stew , chopped in fresh tomatoes , added a little red wine , and left it to simmer down . <p> It was such a satisfaction not to have to fix party food for people more interested in the bar : thin-sliced beef , shrimp on ice , vegetables presented as works of art . Just a skillet of stew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been unable to decide which peaches to use or which dessert to make , and , suffused with delight at the bounty , had made three . I 'd put tart Georgia Belles and Cortland apple slices on a French pie dough , then made a cobbler with the rich Monroes , mixing in vanilla and heavy cream , and was going to pile the sweet yellow O'Henry eating peaches on a shortcake . What a feast . How well my trees provided for me . <p> Just then Harriet came down the stairs and into view . " It 's me at last , " she called out . <p> " Hey , do n't you look pretty ? " Katie stood holding out a hand , making an effort on my behalf . <p> " Do n't you ? " Harriet thrust out hers as well . " Can I help you , Sarah ? " <p> I put the lid on the stew . " This has to simmer . Let 's go out on the porch . " <p> Outside , Harriet offered her hand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Most of the time , " he said amiably , enveloping my friend in a hug . Seating her in a rocker , he asked , " What 'll you have ? I 've got myself a beer , the other ladies are having lemonade . I can get you old Corn Cob or whatever the house-brand whiskey is , you name it . What 's your pleasure ? " <p> Harriet looked up at him . " I 'll take the lemonade , too , Will , if you do n't mind . With a little something to sweeten it ? " She made it a question , a furrow between her brows . <p> " How does gin sound ? " <p> " Just fine . Fine . " She seemed clearly relieved . <p> He did n't go right into the house , however , but stood by her chair . " Let me get this out of the way first , " he said . " Then we can get to visiting . " <p> He was in a white shirt and suit pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making rounds . He had deep wrinkles , I could see when I looked at him objectively , and too much weight around his middle . But the sight of him here , as more than a physician or a friend , filled me with happiness . How fine it was to have things be in public the way they were in private . <p> " I was mighty sorry to lose Sarah 's husband , " Will said . " I 'm sure you do n't recall me all that well from the gaggle of specialists attending Nolan Rankin from head to toe , but I was there . He was a good man ; I looked after him the best I knew how . " <p> Harriet seemed embarrassed . " I know you did . There was nothing anybody  --  " <p> He went to fetch her drink , touching my cheek with his hand as he passed . <p> " Imagine Sarah and me becoming widows the same year , " Harriet said to Katie , being friendly . " I guess you knew my husband Knox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I looked at Katie , wondering how she would answer . She was sitting on the porch floor , her back to the railing , her long legs folded yoga-style . I knew her thinking : that if someone you loved died , that was bad news and you were entitled to a bad time . But you were n't entitled to make a big deal out of whatever name the world gave your particular version of living without a man  --  widow , divorced , single . I 'd heard her hold forth on the theme , pointing out that , in fact , if you took into account girlhood , widowhood , those who divorced , those like her who 'd never married , that most women did n't live with men , and that the women who did so for less than half their lives . <p> But Katie did n't make her speech . " I was sorry about your man , " she said . " It was a bad year all around in that department . " <p> Harriet nodded . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tentative , in case this was n't all right to say to a feminist . <p> " I may join you in that , " Katie replied , sighing . " I had lunch today with the contractor , my sometime steady , but the sparks did n't fly . " She twisted her gold bracelet . " You give a chunk of your life to somebody and it leaves a big gap when he goes . But then when he comes back , it does n't seem possible that he can fill that big a hole , not him , just a normal guy . " <p> Harriet said , " I bet . " And then , " I guess I 'm just at the stage where he 's starting to take up that  --  chunk . " She repeated Katie 's word . <p> I relaxed . The two women might be miles apart in their thinking about women , but they were clearly close enough in their attitude toward men . <p> Will brought Harriet 's drink , a jigger of lemonade in gin , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rim . After handing it over and making sure it was to her liking , he settled himself in the rocker next to me . I leaned back , my arms behind my head . How fine , I thought . The dogs , making contented noises , stirred at our feet . It was nice to be at home in my home . <p> " I found a new private eye for you , Will , " Katie said . <p> " A series ? I like a series . " <p> " He 's just starting out , but he 's done colors in the titles so far : blue , red , white . The P.I . ' s named Easy Rawlins . He 's black . They 're set in the ' 5Os . " <p> " Fine , " Will said . " John D. MacDonald did colors with his Travis McGees . I get queasy when they pick too short a list , say the days of the week . In seven days the P.I . could get snuffed . I like that gal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure by the time she makes it to Z is for Zealot I 'll be  --  " he counted on his fingers  --  " on my way to ninety , staring down the road to it . " <p> " I do n't know those  --  books , " Harriet said , stopping to sip part of her drink . " Knox never read anything but his Civil War histories . " <p> I realized she was feeling outside the conversation . I 'd been looking at Will as he talked , hoping that when he did get to be ninety we 'd be rocking right here , supper simmering on the stove , new frisky dogs thumping their tails . <p> Will picked up on her tone and changed the topic . " Sarah 's got me hooked on these radio call-in shows , " he said . " Do you have them out your way ? " <p> Harriet hesitated , then found her voice . " Most people listen to tapes , I imagine , " she said . " I mean , I 've been going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she 'd given away the secret of her chest , then hurried on . " My children are there . I ca n't believe I have grown children running the financial and legal world , but I do . Anyway , I like to put on some familiar music , and that helps when I 'm fighting that hellish traffic  --  " <p> Will put a hand on my arm and sat a bit . Then he said to me , " Did you see the sheriff 's office has decided to train hounds to track down criminals ? The trail gets cold quick , he said . " <p> Tracking down criminals in our neck of the woods ? Traffic violators ? Tourists from Chattanooga ? " What kind of dogs ? " I asked him . <p> " Redbone hunting dogs . " Will held up two fingers . " The first pair are named Bonnie and Clyde . Figure that : naming canine crimefighters Bonnie and Clyde . The sheriff said they were just starting the hounds on the basics . TGIF . " <p> " Toe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At home in east Texas , " Harriet said brightly , " our sheriff is concerned about crime , too . He 's got a program that puts habitual offenders to work fixing highway right-of-ways . It 's a rehabilitation program . I do n't know if they use dogs  --  " <p> " That 's not rehab , that 's a chain gang , " Katie snapped , then looked at me and shook her head as if she could n't help herself . <p> " I do n't think that 's its purpose , " Harriet replied stiffly . <p> " Sorry , " Katie told her . <p> " Do you know why men never ask directions ? " Will said . " They never ask directions because they have an aversion to finding out they 're lost . We tell ourselves we 're in this dark alley with no exit and the bad guys are heaving toward us aiming to put our lights out because that 's where we mean to be . " <p> Suddenly Harriet rose , seizing her white dress . <p> I reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cough stopped me in my tracks . <p> She clutched at her chest , but shook her head , as if to say , Do n't notice , it 's nothing . It will pass . But she could n't seem to stop , her eyes wide with pain . <p> " I 'll do the honors , " Will said . He bent to pick up her glass as if to get a refill and remained standing inches from her . To Katie and me he said , " Why do n't you two serve up our supper ? We 'll join you in a spell . " Then , just as the screen door swung shut , he called , " Get my bag , Sarah , on the floor of the car . " <p> We ate at what my grandmother used to call the candlelight hour , in the dining room , the wall lights dimmed . The large room had the heavy , flocked brown-and-rust paper that was a favorite of mine , English , about 189O , the original in silk , peonies if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in color . The floor was bare , the high ceiling papered also . I was glad to reclaim for my own this room which had once been saved for bankers ' buffets . <p> Katie ran her hand over the waxed surface of the gate-leg table she knew from the old days and smiled at me . " Nice place you got here , " she said . <p> " Glad you could come , " I replied . <p> I ladled out the stew , which gave off steam as it reached our plates , and scooped up mounds of spoonbread swimming in butter . Will had brought us each a sweating bottle of cold Grolsch beer and a glass . I 'd tossed dandelion greens , arugula , Boston lettuce , and endive with a buttermilk dressing to have after the heavy dish . <p> Katie told that she 'd been given a recipe by Patterson , a client of ROOMS OF ONE 'S OWN from Asheville . " I think she took one look at me and her mind shifted right into Brown Betty , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " And did you make it ? " I asked her . <p> " Sure I did . A little mace , a lot of vanilla in the crumbs . I 'm going to do another room for her . Hey , maybe I 'll get brown-butter cookies this time . " <p> I laughed at that ; Patterson was a new client , still on trial . I saw that Harriet was stirring her stew , picking her fork up and putting it down . She looked uncomfortable , but Will had eased her , done something that seemed to give her temporary relief , a respite from the coughing . <p> Dessert , I thought , would help . Harriet could be counted on to rally . She had a decided sweet tooth . <p> " A largesse of peaches , " I promised them , bringing in the cobbler and the pie with apple slices . How grand both smelled to me.I brought in the shortcake and whipped cream while Will poured coffee for us and decaffeinated for Katie and Harriet . As an extra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You understand , " he said , loosening his belt at the sight of the three treats , " this has got to be a quick fling between us , Sarah . A one-decade stand . I ca n't be around this much food on a regular basis . " <p> " We can order redneck takeout next time , " I told him . <p> I heaped the plates  --  old china ones with paintings of fruit glazed in the center  --  with a sampling of each dessert , trailing whipped cream across the top of all of them . It made me happy to taste the difference in the peaches , to wonder if I would have known , if someone else had made them , which peach was in which dish . But of course I would have . I could even smell the difference as the steam from the cobbler and pie mingled with the cold fresh-peach aroma of the shortcake slices . <p> " When on earth , " Harriet asked , surprised , " did you find time to make all these ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was all right , to mention a nap . I tried to make it sound natural . " When you were sleeping off the trauma of your travels . " <p> Harriet , reminded , told us the story of her plane flights . " Every seat on the plane was taken from Houston to Atlanta . I got stuck next to two women who were carrying on one of those reinforcement conversations that drive you up the wall . I know , I know , I know . ' You 're right , you 're right , you 're right . ' If echolalia is repeating everything twice , what is three times ? And , if that was n't enough , on the quickie from Atlanta to here we hit some turbulence , and a woman near the front began to see her life  --  her death actually  --  flash before her eyes . She started screaming and hollering  --  I 've never heard that before in my life  --  to be let off the plane . The flight attendant , we could hear her , called in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us by that time . It was one of those little DH7s . " <p> She enjoyed her performance of being someone such episodes could upset . It charmed and it also disarmed . How , the implication was , could this tanned blond woman with the gold ear globes be in real trouble , how could she be dying if she could make such a fuss over trifles ? Clearly she must be fine , or we 'd be hearing about it . And even though it went against what we all knew , it worked . We laughed with her , relaxed and easy . <p> Harriet accepted a little brandy and flirted a bit with Will , coaxing out of him stories about his bachelor habits , about the federal judge he almost married , going on in her thin squeaky voice about how she was going to take lessons from him . She was not going to tie herself down too soon , but was going to wait for the right one to come along . She mentioned that she had a young man now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of fact , " but she was not making any commitments . <p> " If he 's young enough to be my grandson , " Will said , " do n't tell me . " <p> " Well , let 's see now . " Harriet pretended to count on her fingers . " Not even if you were precocious , " she said . <p> " Most like the opposite , " he told her . " It 's taken me thirty-three years here to get this one even to invite me to a sit-down dinner . " <p> I licked the last of the whipped cream on my plate with my finger . " Let 's leave all this , " I suggested , gesturing to the dishes , " and catch the sunset . " <p> Walking down the front hall with Will , I asked him , " What about that doctor 's bag ? Where did that appear from ? It looked like a stage prop from a ' 50s film . " <p> " I thought I might be making a house call , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , told him , " Thanks a lot , Will . You worked a miracle . " Then , hesitating , dropping her voice , she said , " I guess you know what 's wrong with me , do n't you ? " <p> " I do , " he told her . " I have a picture of it right here somewhere . " He fished in his wallet while Harriet took a sip of the brandy she was carrying , looking anxious , afraid she was going to get a diagnosis . " Here we go . " Will unfolded a small sheet of notepad paper . <p> I was touched . It was the drawing I 'd made on the phone to Harriet , when I 'd got the bad news : the lung with the tiny dried bud in it , the heart with the vine growing from it . Imagine . He had saved my sketch for her . <p> " What is this ? " Harriet asked , relieved . <p> " My friend 's illustration of your lovely chest , " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , amazed . " Did you do this ? " <p> " I did , sure enough . " <p> Outside , Will whistled back up the pups who were running around under the trees in the dusk . I took the rocker beside him , swinging my feet , content to be sitting here on my porch watching night arrive with the three of them . The women might jostle each other a bit , but perhaps there was no more to it than the Labs scuffling in the grass , chasing the same scent ; perhaps it was , a way of getting acquainted . At least I was not headed upstairs to a night of recriminations such as had always followed having company when Nolan was alive . <p> " I wonder , " I asked them in the hush , " if any place on earth has sunsets so grand as ours . Cherry sunsets in autumn , persimmen sunsets in winter , strawberry sunsets in spring , watermelon sunsets in summer . " <p> As the whole horizon grew blood-red against the darkening sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my hand , and Harriet caught her breath . <p> When I got upstairs after finishing up in the kitchen , Harriet was on a rampage . She was throwing her clothes off the hangers onto the bed , had dragged her garment bag out and was stuffing shoes in the side pockets . Her face was angry and she would n't look at me . <p> " Distressed passenger is catching the next flight out , " she yelled over her shoulder . " You need n't have bothered to ask me to come , but you did , so you have . So I 'm going home . " <p> At first , walking through the door and seeing her packing , I assumed she 'd taken a bad turn . That maybe it had begun to hurt too much . That it had become the punching pain , front and back , Will had said it might . But she was n't coughing , although her voice had a strained , scraping sound . <p> " What is it ? " I asked her , not comprehending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you do n't know , I ca n't tell you . " Her mascara was streaked , but she was n't crying . " I do n't , and you must tell me . What is it ? I thought everything went so well ; it was a special evening for me . " I moved into the room and stopped , hesitant to come too close . <p> " And a perfectly dreadful evening for me , if you want to know . " She was almost shouting , her face red . " I do n't understand why you bothered to have me . The three of you talked around me the whole time as if I was n't even there , as if I did n't exist . It reminded me of how it is around your children , the ultimate in feeling totally invisible . " She took the two-toned slingback shoes off her feet and crammed them into her bag . The motion caused a crushing cough which she got under control . " Dumb me , thinking it was going to be old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands , when it was just us , talking our heads off . I might as well have been in a foreign country . I could n't understand anything anybody was saying . You and your doctor with those initials  --  TGIF  --  and that girl going on about all those detective stories you 'd all read , going on as if I was an illiterate . I could have evaporated on the spot and none of you would have cared . " <p> " But the dinner was for you , " I protested . I did n't know what to say . Had she been fretting all through the evening ? All through the meal ? " You were the guest of honor . I 'd never had them both here before . It was a celebration . " <p> " The dinner was for you  --  to show off how many different desserts you could make out of your old peaches , that 's what it was for . I mean when you handed me the Hershey from the airport  --  airport  --  you said you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who would rather have chocolate to eat than shoes on her feet , and you know that . Even my mom , who 's stone-deaf and mole-blind , can make a chocolate pudding . " She began to wail . <p> I sat on the side of the nearest white-spread bed . I felt as if I 'd been kicked all the way to Georgia . Stunned , and dispirited , too . That an evening I 'd so looked forward to and so enjoyed had been so differently perceived . Had it always been that way with Harriet ? Her grand times at cadet dances had hardly been mine , I knew that . Had we , standing in our wedding gown and maid-of-honor dresses , been of different minds about what was beginning and what was coming to an end ? Posing with our babies for photo albums , had we been worlds apart on what a new generation promised ? <p> It might be that no two people ever shared the same evening . But why such anger , the sense she had not received her due ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that made it all the more painful and all the more bewildering . How could they have been so disappointed ? Was n't being friends for life or being married simply an agreement to be there ? If you took away the trappings of similarity or sex that drew you together , was n't it just a promise to remain ? Perhaps what they saw as entitlement I saw as covenant . <p> " It was a treat for me , " I said . " Pure and simple . Let me make amends . Come on . You 'll find worse company than your echolalia ladies at this hour of the night on a late flight , even if there is one . Come down , and I 'll make the richest darkest chocolate dessert I know how to fix , and you wo n't have to share a bite of it with anyone else . " <p> Harriet wiped her streaked face . She 'd taken off her belt , and , barefoot , in her pique dress , she looked like a camper in Sunday whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken off her velvet bow as well , and her glossy yellow hair fell across both cheekbones . She looked thin , in the way of a young girl . <p> Down in the kitchen , I gave her a juice glass of brandy , then tended to the melting of chocolate and butter on the stove . I 'd decided on fudgies  --  the double-chocolate , butter-laden , flour-scarce brownies frosted in double-chocolate icing I used to make for my children and their friends . Squares Harriet could pile on a plate and carry upstairs to bed . <p> " Just because it does n't last does n't mean it did n't happen , " Harriet said , pulling up a stool . Her squeak of a voice was faint . " Remember how we used to lie out in the sun and baste ourselves with baby oil , getting those deep glorious tans ? Just because we know now you ca n't set foot outside without sunblock forty , that does n't change how it was then . " <p> " We did , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided I 'm only going to keep the times I want and throw the rest away . I want the day we met at Miss Pritchard 's , the day I was your maid-of-honor , the one perfect vacation Knox and I had in the Rockies , and the afternoon my young man showed up at the door like an answer to a prayer . " She drained her brandy and held the glass out to me . " I 'm going to write each one on a slip of paper and tape them together like a film strip of the good times of my life . I 'm going to hang it on my wall at home so that when I wake up that 's the very first thing I see : The Best of Me . " <p> I went to the back door , then remembered that Will had taken Ben home for the night . I 'd promised to call him if Harriet had any more trouble , but I did n't think he meant of this nature . <p> She leaned forward and let her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected , " she said . " You know " She started to speak , choked , started again . " My husband . " Her voice dropped . " My body . " <p> " Yes , " I said . <p> She looked at me , her eyes filling . " That little picture you did was cute . of my lung and heart . I 'm going to show that to my doctor . or maybe carry it with me , and if any nosy ninnies ask me what 's wrong when I 'm coughing up the soles of my feet , I 'm going to show it to them . " She rocked herself with her arms wrapped tight . " You drew that because you were worried about me , did n't you ? " <p> " I did . " <p> Sitting on a stool beside her , I slowly began to undo my hair . Then it was time to frost the fudgies . <p> <p> By SHELBY HEARON <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
