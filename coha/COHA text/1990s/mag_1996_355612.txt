Like the team 's Roseanne and Grace Under Fire , the three new Carsey-Werner comedies making their debut this week are all set in worlds where gleaming Calphalon cookware will never hang from the kitchen racks . Herewith the lives of the working class as interpreted for television by the extremely wealthy : <P> COSBY ( CBS , Mondays 8 p.m . EST ) No longer the town-house-owning Huxtables , Bill Cosby and Phylicia Rashad star as Mr. and Mrs. Hilton Lucas , a Queens , New York , couple battling forced retirement . The show can veer toward the excessively emotional ( " I did n't lose my job . My job was taken away from me ! " Hilton screams early on ) , and Hilton , never far from a handsome cardigan , can appear awfully stately for an unemployed airline clerk . In general , though , Cosby does a fine job of capturing its star 's wry sense of codger bewilderment . Home for the first time in 30 years , and confounded by all tasks domestic , Hilton upsets his wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter 's turtle . Cosby 's other great draw : Made-line Kahn as the couple 's elegantly out-of-her-mind neighbor . <P> MEN BEHAVING BADLY ( NBC , Wednesdays 9:30 p.m . ) Former  --  and still grating  --  Saturday Night Live cast member Rob Schneider and Ron ( ER ) Eldard star as roommates who drink beer with cereal and say things like , " These were n't merely women  --  they were tire models . " The show , inspired by a British sitcom , intends to make knowing observations on the lunacy of male behavior . At moments it succeeds , but mostly it offers two guys so implausibly ill-mannered and idiotic they seem more alien than the 3rd Rock from the Sun crew . <P> TOWNIES ( ABC , Wednesdays 8:30 p.m . ) The show about three women who stay put in a dead-end New England fishing village exploits every imaginable cliche of working-class life . Molly Ringwald stars as a waitress with a drunken buffoon of a father and a churchgoing mother she calls " Ma . " She has two best friends , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another who sleeps with anything that 's not in a lobster trap . As the pals , Lauren Graham and Jenna Elfman upstage Ringwald : her whininess , when it surfaces , is more befitting a girl with a bad seat at an Armani show than one who doles out fried clams . <P>  --  By Ginia Bellafante
