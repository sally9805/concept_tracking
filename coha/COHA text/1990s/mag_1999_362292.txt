Panama has always been a place where strange truth gives fiction a run for its money . In John le Carre 's 1996 novel The Tailor of Panama , a Cockney living in Panama City tricks money out of British intelligence by stitching up a plot involving Asians ' taking over the Panama Canal . In real-life Panama , the story is no less peculiar : a new President is about to be sworn in amid charges that the government has switched control of the canal to a company allegedly controlled by the Chinese People 's Liberation Army . The catfight over that is just a preview . The canal handover  --  the U.S. will pass the waterway over to Panama at noon on Dec. 31  --  is unleashing political separation anxiety in the U.S. and everything from panic to greed in Panama . Le Carre must be amused . <P> The furor comes at a time when Panama is trying to reinvent itself . While only 7% of the country 's economy is dependent on the canal , nearly 100% of its self-image is wrapped up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's most important trade links . This Wednesday the country will swear in a new President , Mireya Moscoso , 53 , whose overriding challenge is to try to turn a world-class location into a world-class country , technologically literate and future oriented . More ambitious Panamanians ( and the country 's well-educated middle class is full of them ) talk of becoming the Singapore of Latin America . Doing that means making the post-handover canal as profitable as possible . <P> What has America 's right wing spooked is how assiduously the Panamanians are working to make the canal  --  which has always been run on a nonprofit basis  --  into a cash cow . It is not a new complaint . In the 1970s , when President Jimmy Carter sold the handover treaty to Congress , there was much whining about turning the canal into little more than an expensive toll road . The latest version of this anxiety adds a national security tweak : fear of China . In 1997 , the Panamanian government finalized a rich deal with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. , based in Hong Kong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . American-owned Bechtel lost out to Hutchison under a less than transparent bidding process . <P> Almost immediately , U.S. officials complained that the Bake-Off had been " unorthodox . " The issue was rekindled in August when Senate majority leader Trent Lott complained that the U.S. had " given the farm away without a shot being fired . " In particular , said Lott , the deal means " U.S. naval ships will be at the mercy of Chinese-controlled pilots and could even be denied passage by Hutchison , " which he calls " an arm of the People 's Liberation Army . " <P> Few observers believe that Hutchison is an arm of the P.L.A . The publicly held firm manages 19 ports in Asia , Europe and the Americas . Shipping experts consider the company among the world 's finest . And , says Joseph Cornelison , the commission 's deputy administrator , " we 'll control the timing of ships going in and out of Hutchison 's ports . " Moreover , under the treaty , U.S. Navy ships will keep their privilege of cutting to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal .
