Dark . GRIFFIN emerges . Wears a long thin coat and a tall hat . GRIFFIN Out the slip back cackle maw of a bust-up century I come falling Living By piece In the ragged corners of time . My body 's lost all sense of history . I 'm left hollering , Out of joint Out of step With my mind . No sense thinking how it all done end : Somehow some other I got to be in this half-bit state . I 'd damn look to set down But got no-where to set down . All 's done end And run me in . Talking bout mean time : Kind you do n't see coming til you 're SMACK too late Do anything cept kick back Eyes ablaze , skin slap against belly  --  This is some kind of hell I 'm walking , This is the end of these days . Flatlands lowlands prairie plains  --  Ca n't tell what 's coming to you Once you 've lit past nothing ; I 've come cross a whole damn continent , Turn round , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm seeking , Batter on into day and night , Beating round loose step and shadow ; Got dead time in corner , Got malachite . I 'm in a place bankrupt of history , In a place called Slaughter : A land 's gleam  --  Life 's gone by Been taken been taken  --  Breath , come give me Cool mercy Swift leave . . . Out , out the drunken belly wide back tumble laugh The green gray tide of plenty And the dark sun 's illusion of another day . It is the eve of an eve of a hell blast infinity ; Look not hereafter There is no time , no place . A wave of dust from earth is rising : I see my life cut open bruised yeah beat to the quick split-falling into unreason this is how I die bit by bit : In time continuous , time Present , Mean time .

NATE Way I see it , there 's only two things you got to know : Time you 're born , and time you die . The rest is not worth thinking about . Does n't mean much once you come to the end of your life . Course , how are you gon na know the time you die ? There is n't always someone round to record it . Who 's to tell you whether you took your last breath at eleven or quarter to five ? Got to feel time . Feel it in your body , So that without so much as a look at a clock you can tell what hour you 're walking , track every pulse that keeps you alive . Numbers tell their own story . What do you say about someone born at midnight , Dies thirteen years on at ten past nine ? What do you say ? Eh ? He taps GRIFFIN with his newspaper . GRIFFIN stirs . What do you say ? GRIFFIN . . . Do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two odd . Twelve plus ten plus nine : thirty-one , Divisible by one . One , three : thirteen . What do you say now ? GRIFFIN Coincidence ? NATE Fate . Numbers are the key . Why do you think I started betting ? I woke up one morning , sat on my wooden chair , went to put on a sock , felt a pain take hold of my chest . . . I stopped breathing . Only thing I could hear was the clock ticking until all it was was a pulse . . . And it was then that I felt time  --  seven forty-five  --  and I knew I would not be dead . It was in feeling that the pain stopped , and the sock was put , and I started walking again . I headed straight to the track . Played the seventh , fourth , and fifth . Damn if I did n't win all three races straight . That 's when I knew it was a sign , what had happened to me that morning . Time had found me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 5 GRIFFIN And if it was n't time ? NATE Nothing else it could be . GRIFFIN Could have been luck . NATE Luck 's a fool 's game . GRIFFIN You play the horses . Half a bet is luck . NATE I play numbers . Not horses . I 'm talking about science , not chance . Time is a law of the universe . It is bound up in all of us . You think I do n't think what would have happened if I had n't stopped that morning , If I had n't listened to that clock ? GRIFFIN You 'd be dead . NATE . . . You do n't know what 's coming to you . GRIFFIN What ? NATE You think you 're dying , but you 're not . You 're at the mercy of time . You 're going to batter on until nothing 's left you , until every stray piece of history has let its skin burn right through you . Luck ? Luck is an accident . You best be ready for what 's coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready , you might see the sun rise . GRIFFIN I 'm ready now . NATE At this hour of the morning ? p. 6 GRIFFIN I do n't keep track of time . NATE . . . You do n't know what 's coming to you . GRIFFIN And you do ? You know all I got coming , you know every goddamn solid thing ? NATE There 's a number playing today : fifth race , index number four-two-five-nine . Talented Prospect is the name . GRIFFIN You do n't know squat . NATE I go to the track every day . I 've become familiar with the dew , the sweat , the sure sight of a Panama hat . I know there is nothing else except the bet , the right number . I play that number on the beat back of a quick-strong thoroughbred Who thinks of nothing else except the run , the race , the daily what 's to come . I take my time . I gaze . The horses are at the gate . I check my watch . Will this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds ? The horses leave the gate . I stop . The clock runs . I can feel blood pounding . Is it my time , my number ? " Go , Star . Go , Thunder . " My heart stops , breath finding . . . it is the end of time . I see a hat fall , crash through the air . It is the same Panama hat I saw on the man who is now seated , scowling . I check my watch . What are the odds ? I walk . I see the man . He is crying . I go to the window . It was " to show today . " Just " to show . " The bills are handed to me . Tight bundles . I place them in my left-hand pocket . There is another race . I check the odds . Number ? Number ? Another bet is placed . p. 7 GRIFFIN Hard-luck bastard . NATE What did you say ? GRIFFIN You 're one hard-luck bastard . Time found you , eh ? There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave from this place , Said " To hell with what 's here on this rotting earth , Hell blast to all who keep watch And to ticking clocks and the counting of names and numbers . Hell with this rock-salt land , this lazy bitch of pale neon and hard-bite alligators ; It is a lesion on my back , pus on my soul . I must take leave of it . Let them wander in an amnesia of dates and hours and half-dead minutes , Gnawing at what they can glean from the phases of the moon and tides . I am late of this world , late in it , and not to return . " And you go to the track every day , keeping time ? There is only one law in this universe : kill , and be killed . Only thing you got is to stay awake . NATE And you 're awake ? GRIFFIN I am on the watch slapped plum cut in the ribs awake . NATE Then you should know one thing . GRIFFIN What 's that ? NATE When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run a hard line down somebody 's belly , Do n't leave until the body 's stopped trembling . Stay , until all but a shiver remains . Count the time , record the days . See wherein lies chaos . Then tell me where you will place your faith . Four-two-five-nine . Good day for betting . Good day .

HANA wears an impeccable 1940s-era dress , scarf , and gloves . Her hair is matted . HANA Whacked-out loser . He got himself a whole wad invested in that track . Ca n't get nobody to buy into it . GRIFFIN Huh ? HANA Nate . Everybody knows him around here . GRIFFIN Nate ? HANA I thought you knew him . Figured you must 've since you were talking so much . GRIFFIN Never met him . HANA One unlucky son-of-a-bitch . He made a whole lot of money , dumped it straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . GRIFFIN How 's that ? HANA He did n't know the first thing about how to run a track . Now he 's stuck with the whole goddamn building . Ca n't get nobody to buy into it . GRIFFIN You think somebody would . As long as there 's a betting man . . . HANA Ca n't bet if you do n't got money . Shame . Place is a damn sight . You seen it ? p. 10 GRIFFIN No . HANA Won me quite a bit one time . Did n't know horses could give you that kind of money . I swear . I must 've made ten , fifty K in one night . Now it 's a ghost of a ghost of a place . Nothing but Nate sitting in the stands running all nine races in his head . Wretched goddamn rotten shame . GRIFFIN He 'll find somebody . HANA He 's a loser , our Nate . He 's the kind of man who hands over what he never had in the hope he 'll get some of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear . Smoke ? GRIFFIN No . HANA pulls out a match-book from her dress pocket , lights the cigarette , smokes . HANA Whacked-out loser . GRIFFIN Sounds like you know him well . HANA I know him fine . You 're around long enough , you know everybody . What 'd you say your name was ? GRIFFIN Griffin . HANA Like the bird ? GRIFFIN Huh ? HANA Like the goddamn bird in those stories . p. 11 GRIFFIN Do n't know . HANA Sure you do . It 's got itself all decked out like some kind of weird-ass lion-eagle-snake . Fucking bird scares everybody away . GRIFFIN I do n't scare nobody . HANA I bet you scared somebody in your time : broke loose a whole slaughter ; come down crows and gulls to pick at that broken ground . GRIFFIN I do n't know what you 're talking . . . HANA Hard to pull yourself away from it , I bet . You break over land and blood like that , all you want to do is stay , look at what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got to move , right ? If you do n't , you become a part of that slaughter , and that ai n't right . Ca n't scare damnation off and then live with it . GRIFFIN I have n't scared anything off . HANA So , you take a walk , see what else is out there . You hit on a spot where you are sure no one will find you . Problem is , you 've been there before . GRIFFIN Shut up . HANA Some sort of memory . . . a killing . . . GRIFFIN Shut the hell up . p. 12 HANA Something you had just plain forgot . GRIFFIN Shut your mouth . HANA . . . Course , sometimes a spot is just a spot . Do n't got to mean nothing . Griffin . Ca n't say I ever met anybody with that name . You sure you did n't make it up ? GRIFFIN Born with it . HANA Cursed at birth . Damn shame . Take me . I was born with luck . Hana 's the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to get what I wanted . Everything just came to me , rolled my way : Mad love , a bit of crime , even got myself a piece of history . And that 's not something you can think about getting . Luck has got to put you in that certain time and place Where you are the first one to get up one morning , see a mighty cloud rise up in space : It was all blue-violet , thrown up into the air like a rocket-swirl . I could n't peel my eyes off that hissing cloud rising up into the cool desert air . I was caught in its bloom and hiss , spinning in a mist of speckled light , Turning blue , then violet , Skin slipping off me iridescent . . . I was burning . I am still burning . Some nights I feel the desert in me , even though it 's been years since I stood under that atom-sparked sky . First one to bear witness . Everyone else since has died . Luck 's kept me moving past what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it luck ? HANA Do n't regret life . Pain 's been good company . You do n't tend to pain , got nothing left to survive . GRIFFIN And if you were to die , you think luck would save you ? HANA I think it 'd go with me . You think you can cheat dying ? Fuck all is what it . . . There is no body that can hold the weight . The most you can do is take comfort in disappearing , take on the history of a new skin . And you wo n't know what it is , but you will have split for a half second that moment of true dying , A moment that can only last the pale quarter of a summer 's day . GRIFFIN And if I were to kill you ? HANA Damn have n't finished my cigarette . GRIFFIN slaps HANA 's cigarette off her mouth . GRIFFIN What would you say ? HANA I 'd say you 'd only have half a life worth living , cause I have already been twice dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty pocket at the end of a line . You think you see a highway stretching ? Look for Pensacola , see what you find . We are at a cross-roads , an un-marked strip of light . I was born in Los Alamos . There is no way you can kill me . I have been bleeding since nineteen forty-five . p. 14 GRIFFIN I could kill you now . HANA You will need much more than what I can give you . There will be days and days , and cold bitten edges of night . Think whose skin will be of most use to you . I am not worth killing . Wo n't nobody miss me if do n't make it to the bar at half-past . . . . Let go . Let go your hands . Think on what you can make on that track off highway . . .

Other times it is so tender You can not help but keep your hands on it For it feels like it is speaking to you , Telling you its history , And as long as you keep your hands , Firm on the tender flesh , You will know everything , The world will be wide open , And you will have found your place . But I know nothing . Only a blast of memory . So I look For skin tender enough to hold my hands , Would I were to touch it , it would not break But let me discover in it Breath and longing , and currents of memory . . . I am looking for time A counting of days A record of a life Stained on a body . How am I to remember feeling If not through the search for skin ? I have been stripped Of every blush and tremble , Every hipbone rush and inside tickle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift. p. 16 Act 1 , Scene 5 scene five GRIFFIN pulls out a pocket knife , runs the edge of the blade along her arm lightly , marking her arm with repeated strokes . BENJAMIN PEASLEE appears . He wears dark pants , a light shirt , and a small coral necklace . BENJAMIN Nothing worse than nothin doin . GRIFFIN puts away the pocket knife . I 've lived in Pensacola most all my life . Ca n't say I know why it is I 've kept here . Got me a glimmer of the world just out the corner of my eye . Not that I could see myself going . Just the possibility , you see ? That 's what I like . You do n't have possibility in this world , you might as well die . What are you doin ? You travelin the world light ? GRIFFIN Done nothing . BENJAMIN Ca n't figure it . Folks come by here , all they want to do is look at the sights . It 's not so bad here when you come to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the like . We even got ourselves some real-live forts back from the old days , And I 'm talking real old , like seventeen and hundred . Some folks , all they want to do is look at the wrecks . They 'll give you a quick fin for any authentic ruins you can dig out from whatever hurricane ripped through here last , as long as it 's still got a bit of blood on it . Is that a bit of blood ? p. 17 GRIFFIN What ? BENJAMIN On your arm ? GRIFFIN It 's nothing . BENJAMIN Do n't look it . GRIFFIN I 'm fine . BENJAMIN Other folks , you do n't know what they want . Crotch-itchers . Worst kind . Any chance you seen Hana ? She usually comes by here early morning . I like to catch up with her , see what she 's got going for the night . GRIFFIN Seen nobody .

GRIFFIN Give you a claw . p. 18 BENJAMIN That 's like something Hana would say . GRIFFIN Is it ? BENJAMIN Yeah . That 's kind of like her talk . And Hana can sure talk about things what with all she 's seen . Sometimes I think I 'm damn lucky to be here in Pensacola . The way the rest of the country sounds , do n't think you 'd want to be anywhere . She comes by here mornings . You sure you have n't seen her ? GRIFFIN Been nobody round . BENJAMIN Seen Nate . Have n't you ? You were talking a good long time . GRIFFIN Do n't know who you 're talking . . . BENJAMIN Everybody 's seen Nate . Hell . You were talking to him longer than most anybody has . Bet he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BENJAMIN Who told you that ? GRIFFIN He lost it , did n't he ? BENJAMIN Hana likes telling people that . Truth is , Nate offered her a deal early on , she turned it down . She never got over the fact . I wonder why Nate would tell you that . GRIFFIN He talked about a lot of things . p. 19 BENJAMIN I made me fifty dollars just last week at the track . Summer 's Dream was the name . Absolute killer hound . When those dogs get to running , they do n't know when to stop . GRIFFIN Dogs ? BENJAMIN Hounds . Like they got on the bus . GRIFFIN You mean horses . BENJAMIN What is it I 'm not saying right ? Hounds . Goddamn fucking hounds . GRIFFIN Dogs ? BENJAMIN That 's right . You want horses , you got to go all the way to Tampa . Personally , I like dogs better . They run faster and they 're less of a stink . Besides , who the hell wants to go to Tampa ? GRIFFIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one . Coolest fifty I ever made .

Batter on all day , thoughts coming at you Beep Beep Beep of thoughts inside , outside , your head Everybody wants to talk They got their numbers , their fate , their dime-store monsters Birds flying dark fields and deserts , goddamn luck . . . Fuck all is what it . . . Fuck all . Got to wait , wait , let blood run out , And there 's time , time , and more time , And you do n't got a watch to check , you do n't got a bet , You got nothing in this world cept your head hollering front and back And there 's time , time , and more time And all you want to do is set down in the only place you can remember : Got to get back to Pensacola Where there were trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once spent a summer forgetting your body in the arms of another And you think " It was good " this time I can remember , It was something , a scrap of something that could get me out From under this mean time But everybody wants to talk , talk , And the Beep Beep Beep insde your head gets louder , And you think I ca n't listen , I ca n't listen anymore Cause it is fucking early , it is morning , And I 'm not even awake . p. 20 BENJAMIN . . . Know how I met her ? GRIFFIN What ? BENJAMIN Hana . GRIFFIN No . BENJAMIN She came up to me looking for directions . Right off the bus . Could n't have been more than nine in the morning . She had on this purple hat . She looked like something out of a picture , One of those pictures you find in antique shops , the like . And she was wearing gloves . Damn hot , and she 's wearing gloves . I thought " This woman is sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of hat . She came up to me . I was standing at the Tackle-and-Bait over on Cedar smoking a shag , and she says to me " Where in fuck am I at ? " I thought " Now , this is not the same woman who 's wearing that hat . This is a woman who 's seen a bit of hell and come back . " I said " I am Benjamin Peaslee , and I am going to take you on the grandest tour this side of Pensacola . " She looked at me . Must 've looked for a good second . Then whack . She slapped me with that gloved hand , Almost knocked me down a step . Never seen anything like Hana . Do n't know if I ever will . GRIFFIN She 'll come back . BENJAMIN People get to disappearing , they do n't ever come back . Been in this town long enough to know that . Hell . Damn near whole country : folks disappearing all over like nothing . Woman named Maureen , up by Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her mouth hanging open . Not been heard from since . p. 21 GRIFFIN I could look for her . BENJAMIN Maureen ? She 's long gone . GRIFFIN Hana . I 'll look for her . BENJAMIN Where are you going to look ? You do n't know nothing about this place . You 're traveling light like a goddamn bird , not even awake . GRIFFIN I 'm awake . BENJAMIN You 're going to lose yourself in the Blackwater , End up walking down some old one-lane road , Get your ankles all scratched up from the briars and ticks , Like you got your arm all scratched up from that stupid pocket knife . You think I do n't see things ? I see plenty . GRIFFIN I 'll take myself out . BENJAMIN Out ? GRIFFIN On the road . I 'll go to the edge of tar , dirt .

BENJAMIN No more than splinters of fact . That 's all there is . Goddamn splinters . Light change. end of One @x NATE appears . NATE Vertigo . That 's what they call it : When you 're standing at an edge and you think you might fall . Except I do n't have to be at an edge . I could be in a room , standing in bare feet next to my bedroom slippers , looking at the floor When it hits me : The dizziness , the loss of air , And I feel " Yes , this is my last moment . Now I will fall a short distance to death . " I do n't trust floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and the ground . Sometimes , at the track , I catch myself looking down And I have to hit myself to stop the dizziness from taking over . Not a pat . But a hit . Firm . Right in the belly . Hana used to say I was soft , that if a wrong moment would catch me , I would n't be able to hit , that my hands would freeze , And my belly would go slack like a pup 's . She 'd say vertigo was an unconquerable beast . And for a time , I believed her . But one night , It was one of those wretchedly still nights when all you could hear were the sea oats whispering in the breeze , Hana made a killing at the track . Last race of the evening , she came up with godawful winner " Glimpse of Glory . " I thought " Only Hana would pick that one . " And only for Hana would it win at the end of a long day . I went up to her . Placed fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw them up in the air like it was a game , Like she 'd seen somebody in the flickers Throw flash money around and a C note meant nothing Cept it looked a little less used than the rest of the bills come her way . I looked up as the bills fluttered in the air . I could feel the rough wood of the stands giving under my feet , And for a moment , I was in vertigo , truly in it . But then I looked at Hana and saw her smile , and the air came back to me , And my belly went hard , and my hands hit back : punch cuff jab swing hook jab cut cut . . . And when I looked up again , My breath fast , unrecognizable , I could see the bills had come down in haystack piles at my feet . And there was no one around , Except for a glimpse of Hana leaving .

Damn if it is n't the one I took of her when she got here with that stupid hat . Ca n't see why she would keep this . Ai n't much of a picture . Ai n't much of anything .

On the small of her back . Traced all the spots she 'd been , seen , down country . She said if I touched her , wherever the spot , It 'd send her back there , and would send me with it , So that if I wanted to see a place , all I had to do was touch , no more than a tap , And I 'd be in a white shell of a house on the edge of New Mexico standing all of one story in the desert plains , or in a shed near the banks of the Ohio shaded by tree bark , the smell of birch filling the air from the sudden rain .

A scarf , an earring , a clump of hair , a vial of perfume , a slice of a photograph you took years ago : objects that belonged once to someone we called " Hana , " But now are just objects , signs of a life , and who they belong to comes down to whoever finds them .

I put my mind in hope of Alaska , Thinking if I could get to that blue ice , Fix myself in the blizzard of atoms in the blank snow , Maybe I 'd find a trace of Aunt Lia .

I could run across ten thousand borders , I would n't get rid of what I 'm feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean anything . I got the blood of earth inside me . My eyes are wide And would I were to keep my eyes , open , I could see everything . Light shift. p. 32 p. 33 Act 2 , Scene 5 : Confession scene ten Confession NATE appears . NATE It was at one and seven . At the striking of the clock . That was the last time I saw Hana . She was walking down Redfield , headed toward the bay . I would n't have noticed her except she was wearing this crown of flowers on her head . I stopped . I had to stop her . " Where is it you 're going with that crown of delphinium ? " I did n't mean it in any other way than it was intended , but for some reason , she got very upset And started screaming at me , pulling at the delphinium , throwing the sallow blue petals in my face . I could n't make out what she was saying she was talking so fast . Something about " pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always make a point of not listening to people when they 're screaming . But I was fascinated by the petals that kept falling and she kept throwing at me . They were incredibly soft . New-born . Gardens around here yield such hard petals , but these . . . And then she kissed me . I think she meant to bite me , but it came out like a kiss . Very quick . A peck . I did n't know what to make of it . I suppose I felt pleasure . I must 've felt something . I do n't get kissed very often . But I do remember I blushed a bit , because she started laughing . There was a petal inside her mouth , stuck on the edge of her tongue . It must 've gotten there when . . . the kiss . She talked while she laughed . I think she was laughing at me . I wanted to leave . But she hit me on the face so I could n't . She looked at me . It was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember I suddenly became very conscious of my hair And whether I had combed it that morning or not . Her eyes were very clear . I could almost see myself in them . She was about to say something , but she did n't get to say it . She walked away . Light shift. p. 34 p. 35 Act 2 , Scene 6 : Interrogation scene eleven Interrogation BENJAMIN appears . BENJAMIN Must 've been morning last I saw her . I never know what the hell time it is . She was at the park across from Lenny 's bar . Not much of a park . A couple of benches , trees , whatnot . I did n't want to meet up with her . But Hana waved me down . Damn . Now I had to talk to her . It was freezing . Something about the bay being right there brings cold air right in , swoops it down all the way from Alaska . Did I tell you I 'd been there ? One time . I met up with this woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore this godawful yellow dress . She was n't a bad looker , but she was whacked out of her mind . She could n't think about anything except money . Made me sick . Pretty soon I started seeing trucks of people driving down the road . All of them thinking about money ; Like there was a disease got hold of them : a fucking contagion . I dropped her . Right by the highway . " And take you disease with you , " I said . Mo just looked at me . Her mouth all curled up . I think she wanted to do me some violence , but I did n't give her time . I must 've killed her . Good as dead you leave somebody by the road like that . I should have done it right . Should have used my hands . But she had to wave me down . Hana . She looked at me " Got a shag ? " Yeah . Yeah . I always got a shag . " Why do n't you buy your own , huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ai n't no money to be had in this town unless you got yourself a knack , Put some money on the track , then we can talk about what you 're made of . " Hana smoked the shag . She liked blowing smoke up into the air like it was going to catch her on the way down . I had a swell headache . The park smelled of piss . She talked something . I talked something back , but what I wanted to do was shut her up , Shove that scarf down her mouth tight . Mo , Hana , and all the rest of them talking big money when all you got is an all-day smoke at the Tackle-and-Bait waiting for someone to drop pocket on a " deluxe grand tour " of Pensacola . Smoke was bringing her down . She started getting teary like she could get . I kept looking at the trees . They were right wrecked . I was n't sure they could hold the weight . Ai n't hung bodies on those limbs for a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been reading me . She put her hand to me , right against my kit . " You 're going to do me out here in the park in front of God and all His children ? " She kept her hand . I thought some Joe walks by , gets a look at this , what 's he gon na think ? I nabbed her . Just for a minute . She damn near swallowed her shag . You ever seen anybody choke on those things ? They get this look on their face like one of those cartoons on the TV . " You ai n't seen me , " she says . " You 're going to turn around . You 're going to walk . " I 'm thinking she 's going to clip me , right ? She 's got some fancy-ass gun , she 's going to waste me right here in this stinking park . She looks at me . " How are you going to buy me a drink if you do n't walk ? " I turned around . I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should 've let her cup my kit . I just about made it to Lenny 's door when I heard a strange sound , something like a pop . I thought , screw buying a drink at this hour of the morning . I 'm already down a shag for the day . Go on . Keep walking .

HANA You come here , feed me some dead woman 's shags , get me all toked up , and then you 're going to take that little pocket knife you got and you 're going to finish me off , is that right ? GRIFFIN I thought we 'd talk . HANA We 've been talking . GRIFFIN We could take a walk . HANA Where ? Back to town ? Back to the Seville Quarter ? Or do you want to show me where you dumped her , Where you snuffed poor Septima for a bit of shag ? p. 41 GRIFFIN I come here to talk , get some fucking air . Ca n't get air around here .

Well , I am waiting for the time of the not living , those without speech or shame , So I can inhabit their space and inherit my name . I took the shags . Yeah . I stole them . Off her body . Right . But I did n't kill her . Hell . I did n't even know her . I ca n't kill somebody I do n't know . I got to get to know somebody , think their thoughts , know what the hell it is they want , then I can kill them , cause it 's not about killing , but how it is they want to die . Then I can do anything : cut slice pop . . . Or I can do nothing . I can just watch . HANA You do n't know what you 're going to do . You come all the way out here , you do n't got a goddamn clue . Well , let me tell you , I got my eye on a pale blue mustang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn if I 'm not going to take it . Cause I have had it with Pensacola . I 've gone round and round that town . Walking and smoking . Putting on a hat . Ai n't nothing change . When I got off the bus , I thought " Bet I could do something here . In this place . " But history brought me down . Cause everything I see in Pensacola , in that water , puts me in mind of the desert and Aunt Lia and the blue-violet hiss , and of a mad love with a hard belly and tight jeans and a slap across the mouth , and all this time I 've been thinking " I 'm gon na rid . I 'm gon na rid myself . " But I 've just been taking on more history , more memories , more crap to fill my mind . Well , this body ai n't taking any more of this . It 's had all it can take .

It wo n't change where you 've been . HANA Will change where I 'm going . My memory is buried in this soil . Under the skin of this land . From New Mexico to Alaska straight down to Pensacola and the deepest part of the water . But I go to another country on a whole other continent , I 'll be rid of this land-memory , and be what I 've always wanted : a body in time . GRIFFIN I could take you . HANA You got a mustang ?

" You have perfected a steady routine : the walk , the watch , the wait . But you are unnecessary , a specter haunting the track , betting , losing , winning in the race of your own making . GRIFFIN There 's time . NATE And numbers . And all the infinite twists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you own nothing . Look at those men in their suits Downing their drinks hour after hour Staring with eyes feverishly at the screen Pressed against the glass straining to see everything as if seeing and being were the same thing . " I have created those men , " you think , " I have fed their greed . " And what is it they 're greedy for ? The thrill of the win , the luck of a score , or is it a hunger they seek , A deep hunger that tears at the inside of their bellies Grown weak with salt and sweet and another vodka , please ? And you think " I have killed those men . I have let their blood run out bit by bit . " And you think " It is time now for flesh to meet flesh . No more anonymous killings . Let me see the eyes , the face , watch the hand rise , the body shake . I am ready . " GRIFFIN And you look into the eyes , and you find it hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why is n't she trembling ? I want to see you tremble like Lia in the Cadillac dreaming of Alaska Biting my tongue so hard the blood would run down my throat , snake down my belly , And all I could think was . . . GRIFFIN A woman like that do n't want squat from a pig with a wad of money . Got no use for any of your kind . No point seeing if what there is to see is nothing . I 'd rather close my eyes .

Take all you brought here with you , cause where you 're going I 've already gone . I 'm here now . NATE At the striking of the clock GRIFFIN I am rid you . Pause .
