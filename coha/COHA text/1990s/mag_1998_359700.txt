One of the most daring deep-space missions NASA has ever planned is turning out to be one of the least publicized . The target is a large asteroid named 1992KD , which orbits the sun millions of miles from Earth . But that destination is almost incidental to the performance of the spacecraft that will make the trip . Though it looks little different from countless other unmanned probes NASA has launched , the ship will be navigated by an electronic brain that has been likened to HAL , the independent-minded computer in the film 2001 , and will move through space under power of a system that has long been the stuff of technological fantasies : an ion propulsion engine . <P> If all goes as planned , Deep Space 1 , scheduled for launch later this month , will be the forerunner of a new generation of spacecraft . While flight planners hope the ship will make some interesting observations about the target asteroid , including its composition and the structure of its surface , DS1 's prime assignment is to validate a host of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-profile mission . Says Marc Rayman of Jet Propulsion Laboratory , DS1 's chief engineer : " We have an unproven propulsion system , powered by an unproven solar array , commanded by an unproven navigation system . " <P> What is most remarkable about the spacecraft is how it gets from place to place . After being launched by an ordinary rocket , DS1 will be pushed through space by an engine that works by firing electrons into atoms of xenon gas , stripping each of an electron and giving the atoms an electric charge  --  ionizing them . The ions are then accelerated through an electric field and emitted from thrusters at 65,000 m.p.h . Despite that speed , the particles produce little thrust , comparable to the weight of a piece of paper . <P> Still , that constant push will add 15 to 20 m.p.h. daily to DS1 's speed . " It takes three days to get to 60 m.p.h. , " says Rayman , " but if you thrust for 300 days , you 're up to 6,000 m.p.h . I like to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience pays off . DS1 will carry a mere 180 lbs . of xenon fuel , about one-tenth the fuel needed for a conventional craft . Electricity required to power thrusters and other equipment will come from a new solar panel equipped with 720 lenses that focus sunlight down to a strip of solar cells . <P> Just as innovative is DS1 's navigation system . By scanning stars and asteroids , the spacecraft will know precisely where it is and will make its own maneuvers , perhaps even during its asteroid rendezvous . Programmed to fly six miles above the giant rock , DS1 will also have the option of swooping down to half that altitude . <P> DS1 's use of ion propulsion and self-navigation , Rayman says , " is analogous to having your car find its own way from L.A. to Washington , arrive at a designated parking place , and do it all while getting 300 m.p.g . " By the same analogy , could the car then drive on to other cities too ? Apparently . Barring problems , DS1 will have enough fuel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January 2001 and , as its grand finale , to Comet Borrelly later that year . <P>  --  By Leon Jaroff
