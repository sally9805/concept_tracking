<p> The Falcons blitzed more in Sunday 's 41-10 win over New England than they have all fall and ended up tying a season-high with six sacks . But it does n't mean they 'll blitz like mad against the 49ers ( 7-2 ) on Sunday . <p> The Falcons ( 7-2 ) did n't feel threatened by New England 's injury-riddled receiving corps , but they will give greater respect to San Francisco receivers Jerry Rice , J.J. Stokes and Terrell Owens . <p> Against the Pats , the absence of receivers Terry Glenn , Tony Brown and Vincent Brisby allowed Atlanta to gamble more than usual , with a reduced risk of getting burned . <p> Atlanta had blitzed less this season than last , in hopes of giving up fewer big plays . They did give up pass plays of 43 and 46 yards Sunday , but on the 46-yarder New England 's Shawn Jefferson got away with a push on Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan . <p> On the 43-yarder to rookie receiver Tony Simmons , Falcon free safety Eugene Robinson ( 6 feet 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blitz , but the 6-foot-5 , 233-pound quarterback did n't go down . He lofted a ball Simmons ran under as cornerback Michael Booker gave up deep position . <p> " When No. 88 ( Glenn ) does n't play , that makes a big difference , " Robinson said . " They have no one to go to right away with the ball . You 've got to make ( Bledsoe ) beat you ( by throwing ) off his back foot . We did that with Green Bay in the Super Bowl ( two seasons ago ) . <p> " He 's a true pocket quarterback that says , ' Give me time , and . . . I will eat you alive . ' " <p> " Our cornerbacks did a great job , " defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said . " This forced Bledsoe to hold the ball longer , and when he did , our pass rush was able to get to him . " <p> The Falcons did such a good job getting to Bledsoe that the Pats began keeping tight end Ben Coates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 13 yards . <p> " When I saw them keeping Coates in , I knew we had them , " Falcons linebacker Cornelius Bennett said . <p> The differences this Sunday , however , are many  --  since Niners quarterback Steve Young intends to return from an injury . <p> He does n't drop as deep as Bledsoe , he gets rid of the ball quicker , and Rice , Stokes and Owens are better than Jefferson , Simmons and 37-year-old recently un-retired Henry Ellard . Going for 100 Running back Jamal Anderson was reinserted on the Falcons ' next-to-last possession so he could surpass 100 yards . On his first 29 carries , he had 96 . After carries of 2 , 3 , and 3 yards , he finished with 104 , the sixth time in seven games he has surpassed 100 . Only Denver 's Terrell Davis has more 100-yard games ( seven ) , and Anderson is third in the NFL with 966 yards , trailing Davis ( 1,219 ) and Detroit 's Barry Sanders ( 1,012 ) . After rushing for two TDs Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine TDs , eight rushing . ' Stop , I say ' Sometimes , quarterback Chris Chandler is courageous to a fault , and late in the fourth quarter Sunday was a good example . The Falcons had third-and-7 at the Pats ' 12 , leading 31-10 , but instead of throwing the ball away when under pressure , Chandler took off up the middle . As he approached the goal line , he lowered his shoulders and dove forward , getting stopped at the 3 . He got the first down , but coach Dan Reeves said he could have done without it . <p> " I did n't want him to run , but you ca n't go out there and tell him not to do it , " Reeves said . " When he took off , my heart was in my throat . " <p> Three penalties later , Chandler passed 22 yards down the middle to tight end O.J. Santiago for a TD and a 38-10 lead . Speaking of ends <p> Santiago caught three passes for 53 yards , including touchdown receptions of 7 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three scores , nearly matching the numbers he had in 10-plus games as a rookie last season ( 17 receptions , 217 yards , two TDs ) before breaking his leg . <p> With wide receiver Tony Martin ( one catch , 15 yards ) all but shut out by the combination of Patriots cornerback Ty Law , who had two interceptions , and the frequent double-team help of free safety Willie Clay , that left Terance Mathis ( eight catches , 117 yards ) , and Santiago to do some serious damage . <p> " With receivers as good as ours , " Santiago said , " and the fact teams now have to game-plan for Jamal , that opens up some things for me . " <p> Reserve tight end Brian Kozlowski also had a catch Sunday , for eight yards . Smith 's saga When defensive end Chuck Smith returned Bledsoe 's fumble 71 yards for a score in the second quarter , it was the fourth defensive score of the season for the Falcons . Strong safety William White and reserve defensive end Anthony Edwards also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interception for a score . The Falcons lead the NFL with 16 fumble recoveries . <p> The irony is that Smith has fits in practice when defensive line coach Bill Kollar works on fumble-recovery drills . <p> " Bill throws the ball real hard in front of us , " Smith said . " I never get them in practice , but I got that one . " <p> Cornerback Ray Buchanan , however , tried to talk Smith out of it . He was just off Smith 's left hip almost the whole way . <p> " I was saying , ' They 're going to catch you ; they 're going to catch you , ' " Buchanan said , laughing . " I said , ' Lateral it , lateral it . I can get there quicker . ' " <p> Smith hung on , though , and tackle Travis Hall threw a critical block on Jefferson , who was gaining quickly . <p> " When ( former coach Jerry ) Glanville was here , linemen were always looking to pitch it to ( former DBs ) Deion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want us pitching it now . " Extra points <p> With his eight catches Sunday , Mathis moved into second place in franchise history with 360 catches in his four-plus-year career with the Falcons . He trails only Andre Rison ( 423 ) and is ahead of Alfred Jenkins ( 359 ) . . . . Mathis also has gone 226 plays without a fumble , since 1995 . . . . Reeves , whose career regular-season record is 155-117-1 , needs three wins to tie former Vikings coach Bud Grant ( 158-96-5 ) for eighth place on the career list . . . . In Lester Archambeau and Smith , who each have seven sacks , the Falcons are one of just four NFL teams with at least two players to have that many , joining the 49ers ( Chris Doleman , 12 , and Roy Barker , 9.5 ) , Giants and Raiders . . . . In Mathis ( 40 catches , 611 yards , four TDs ) and Martin ( 32 catches , 610 yards , four TDs ) , the Falcons are one of just three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining the 49ers ( Rice  --  48 catches , 710 yards , five TDs ; and Owens  --  40 catches , 613 yards , and six TDs ) and Carolina . . . . Atlanta is No. 2 in the NFL against the run , allowing just 76.6 rushing yards per game , trailing San Diego ( 68.4 ) . . . . The Falcons are tied with Arizona for the most fumble recoveries in the NFL ( 16 ) , are tied with Buffalo for the best turnover ratio in the league ( plus-eight ) and are tied for second in the NFL with 23 takeaways ; Arizona leads with 27.
