As negotiations proceeded fitfully last week , the deadly sport of Hide the Hostage began to resemble a sophisticated version of the children 's game Operator . Each party to the negotiations , whether dealing openly or behind the scenes , relayed its demands to Javier Perez de Cuellar . The U.N . Secretary- General transmitted each message to a third party , who in turn cried , " Operator ! " requesting that the communication be repeated , clarified or amplified . Perez de Cuellar then went back to the first party , bearing new details , fresh analysis and cajoling reassurances . <P> While all this had the promising feel of an end game , the negotiations proceeded at a frustratingly slow pace , and no one could tell if a settlement was days or weeks away  --  or possibly stalemated altogether . With so many circuits buzzing at once , there was ample room for misunderstanding , misinterpretation and plain old mischief . Was the tally of Western hostages 11 or 10 ( is British journalist Alec Collett dead ? ) or nine ( is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The estimated number of Arabs imprisoned in Europe fluctuated between 19 and 23 . One day , the 9,000 or so Palestinians detained in Israel in connection with the nearly four-year-old intifadeh were not a factor ; the next , they were added to the equation , and their numbers were inflated to 18,000 to boot . <P> Despite the conflicting signals , the outlines of a deal began to emerge . The pivotal player was Israel , which insisted on a strict accounting of the whereabouts of seven missing servicemen but promised to be " very flexible " about the terms for trading its Arab prisoners in southern Lebanon that would in turn spring the release of the Western captives . Jerusalem offered a two- step plan . In phase one , Israel would release about 50 Shi'ites after receiving a full report on its soldiers , verifiable by either videotape or international observers . The second stage would see the release of the remaining Shi'ite detainees ( is the total 375 , as Israel maintains , or more than 400 , as others claim ? ) , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange , Israel would retrieve its surviving soldiers and the remains of the rest . Israeli officials offered on Saturday to allow the Red Cross to visit Sheik Obeid if it is also given access to Israelis in Arab custody . <P> Since neither the Bush Administration nor any European government wants to be perceived as bargaining with kidnappers , they made no overt demand about the timing of the Western hostages ' release . But plainly the West expects its captives to be freed during one of those two phases . <P> While the contours of the deal seemed clear , the mechanics posed nettlesome questions . Among the most vexing was a condition contained in the letter former British hostage John McCarthy brought to Perez de Cuellar from Islamic Jihad , a fundamentalist Shi'ite faction , operating under the banner of the pro-Iranian Hizballah , that holds several Westerners . It called for " the release of our freedom fighters from prisons in occupied Palestine and Europe . " To whom that referred was anybody 's guess  --  and for whom Islamic Jihad presumed to speak was no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand ?
