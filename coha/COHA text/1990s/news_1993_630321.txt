<p> In reference to your July 28 article ( " FAA ' Not Happy ' About Closing Meigs , " news story ) on the possible closing of Meigs Field by Mayor Daley . . . let me advise you that it is not only the Illinois Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration that object to the closing , it also is the more than 200,000 passengers who use the field yearly . <p> They support McCormick Place conventions and the downtown area and would greatly add to the current flight delays at Midway Airport . <p> More important is the subterfuge triggered by the mayor 's diversion of federal grants intended to improve Meigs . The mayor has accepted these funds and has done nothing for the airport . Even the candy counter has been closed . <p> A restaurant fully plumbed is locked , stored with city files . It has never opened because ridiculous restraints have been placed upon every potential operator . <p> The eastern seawall is crumbling and is in a state of dangerous erosion . This gorgeous sliver of 3,970 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the mayor . Why ? The entire area surrounding Meigs Field consists of unused parkland . <p> The location is the finest for businessmen visiting the Loop , and the FAA already has approved an extension to the south of a few hundred feet that would allow larger equipment to land , thereby further easing the burden at O'Hare . <p> Control of Meigs should be taken from the City of Chicago , which has allowed the facility to deteriorate , and should be placed in the hands of the State of Illinois . Chuck Wenk , chairman , Illinois Board of Aeronautical Advisors , Highland Park Hard Truth <p> Your excellent report ( " Politics Still a Waiting Game , " news story , July 25 ) on the short-changing of minorities in suburban city halls once more demonstrates a hard truth - you can not enter the mainstream without our common tongue , English . <p> Learning English does not mean forsaking native origins . Millions adapt and succeed and retain their ethnic identity and links . Those who do not try to adapt and choose to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are left behind . <p> Indeed , lack of English is a major hurdle for Hispanics and Asians . But sadly , for most American blacks , whose native language is English , the major hurdle still remains race . <p> There is little excuse for anyone to remain handicapped by lack of English skills . All kinds of instruction opportunities abound . As a tutor for Literacy Volunteers of America , I try to help by teaching English as a second language to immigrants , temporary residents and others who want to learn . <p> The wisdom of learning English is boldly illustrated in the same July 25 edition ( " Language Training Banks on the Future , " news story ) . <p> One of your workplace stories told of the success of a group of West Side factory workers in completing English classes . <p> For Maria Soto , the training paid off in better job security and hopes for advancement .

What has happened to the president 's jobs program ? What has happened to the promise to put people first ? <p> Coming to Chicago for a jobs conference , Clinton held out a hope that worker-management " cooperation " would produce more jobs . We see everywhere , however , that big , supposedly stable , globally competitive companies are laying off workers , with no promise that even an economic recovery would stop this trend to do more with less . <p> Why all this energy directed toward worker-management cooperation when what we need is a jobs program ? <p> What we need is investment . <p> Without investing in infrastructure , our cities will die . Without substantial investment in the human and physical capital of this country , we can have no vision of full employment . <p> President Clinton needs to mount the soapbox and proclaim , as he did in the campaign , that there is a difference between " investment " and " spending .

Boyd , Douglas Insurance Flaw <p> There is no mandatory insurance law in Illinois . There is a mandatory insurance card law . This is a big difference . <p> A woman ran a red light last January and hit my two-week-old Buick . <p> She readily admitted " not paying attention " and was given two tickets at the scene , for running a red light and driving on an expired license . She did show an insurance card ; however , her insurance had been out of force for five months at the time . <p> The judge dropped the " expired license " charge , fined her $ 50 ( a slap on the wrist ) and told her " oh my , you did have a bad day . " He told me I would have to take up the insurance card issue with Springfield . <p> This woman had a bad day ? I saved for years to buy a new car , and within two weeks had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $ 3,000 , and I 'm out of pocket for my deductible and rental cars for three weeks . <p> This woman had a bad day ? But I did learn something : It 's not necessary to have auto insurance in this state . Just pay one month 's premium and get that card ! Marie Hartian , Northbrook Lost Ambience <p> There 's something deeply disturbing about the recent opening of Planet Hollywood in River North , and it 's not Planet Hollywood - it 's River North . <p> The area is an urbanistic desert ; its smattering of good buildings is spread so thin across an endless sea of parking lots that no matter how many Planet whatevers land here , the place still has all the appeal of Uranus . <p> What River North needs is a comprehensive master plan for redevelopment , not Arnold Schwarzenegger . <p> River North , along with similar areas around the country , is a feeble attempt to duplicate the ambience and vitality of New York 's Soho neighborhood . It ca n't be done . <p> Soho consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious industrial architecture , much of which is cast iron , a unique building material that has produced a singularly magnificent cityscape . Soho is a New York classic . It 's not only in New York but of it . <p> Chicago must find its own way as a city to discover its own assets , create its own classics . <p> Rush Street , in its day one of the country 's foremost nightlife/ entertainment meccas , was once such a Chicago classic . The convergence of Rush and State created a compelling urban space that physically embraced you as you strolled along it , with just the right mix of shops . <p> The disintegration of this once-urban street has made Chicago the only major city in the country without a great legendary nightlife district to showcase the city 's charms and eccentricities for locals and visitors . <p> That Chicago could so casually discard something so central to its identity as Rush Street in such a foolish attempt to emulate New York says a lot about this city 's sense of itself .

How is the CTA to increase its ridership if new riders ca n't find the subway stations ? Jim Benson , Irving Park
