Bill Bass . founding father of the Body Farm , peels back a body bag to measure a corpse 's skull . Below left , Bass checks for maggots in the trunk of a car that once held a dead body . Below right are the skeletal remains of one body from Bass ' vast collection . // HE 'S BEEN DEAD almost two weeks now , lying here face down , his nose mashed like a mauve marshmallow against a thin layer of mulberry leaves . A frigid December rain spatters his nude body , but it is only I who shivers . Gray hair splays over a neck deeply wrinkled ; an old sailor , I think , maybe a farmer . But he died a derelict , and that 's why he is here-at the University of Tennessee 's human decay research facility . The Body Farm . " The temperature is in the 40s , simply too low for much insect activity . But even so , a maggot mass is probably building up inside him somewhere , " says Bill Bass , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of Tennessee 's forensic anthropologist . He established this research facility some two decades ago , and I was here to learn about the emerging field of forensic entomology , the use of insects to solve crimes . The earliest recorded crime investigation using insects took place in 1235 in China . The murderer used a rice sickle . The mayor called the men of the village together , and told them to lay their sickles in the sunshine . Flies landed on one . The murderer confessed . Using insects as a forensic tool seems obvious . But before the early 1980s , nobody had given much serious thought to the idea . Crime-scene investigators regarded flies and maggots as nothing more than revolting annoyances . In the past two decades , however , investigators have learned that insects can provide valuable evidence . They are especially useful in determining the time of a victim 's death . When the body of a dead person ( or any animal ) ends up outdoors in warm weather , it immediately attracts insects , most of them looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their age , and you can probably pinpoint the day , if not the hour , of death . And that , in the realm of murder , is often crucial in confirming or invalidating a suspect 's alibi . There are only about 20 forensic entomologists in the United States . Most work at natural history museums or universities , and are called in for only a few cases a year . Although they are best known for their work on murder cases , forensic entomologists can help solve a variety of other crimes . For example , an entomologist may be asked to decide whether a marijuana shipment came from South America or Asia , based on the bugs found with the drugs . Bass began his crime-solving career as a forensic anthropologist , not an entomologist , in 1971 . His prime interest was in studying the bones of thousand-year-old South Dakota Plains Indians , but he found himself examining bodies cold only a week . " The crimescene people find a body in the woods and the first thing they want to know is , When did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered early that there was no good reference work , no book that would guide you . " So he decided to generate that database himself , using a plot of woods where researchers could not only document decomposition rates but also teach other scientists how to discover hidden facts about a body 's death . Bass ' combination laboratory/graveyard now covers nearly four acres of hillside woodland , surrounded by a gray stockade fence topped by razor wire , and entered through a door marked " Biohazard . " Corpses have n't been difficult to find . " Many people want to donate their bodies to science , " says Bass ' colleague Murray Marks . " Past 50 or so , or if you have cancer , diabetes , and so forth , your organs are probably not transferable . But give them to anthropologists-we 'll take anything . " The corpse lying prone before us is the 10th acquired in 1996 , and will forever be known only as " 10-96 . " It will be left here , along the footpath , for about a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 800 others lined up neatly in the anthropological collection beneath UT 's stadium , home of the Volunteers . Today , on this gray and gloomy December Monday , two other bodies lie exposed in various stages of decay . One has been here two months , stretched out under a blackjack tree , with most of the flesh already gone from the skull . Another corpse has been sprawling across a log in a hunting-accident pose for about a year now ; nature has reclaimed nearly everything but the bones and a leathery sheet of skin along the top . Maggots , now long gone , had left that particular piece of skin there to provide shade . Other bodies rest in vaults and culverts . Some are even buried ; these , casketless and at various depths , are perfect for testing carrion-sniffing dogs . Off to the side sits a ' 76 Oldsmobile . Its spacious trunk once held a decaying body while a front-seat skeleton silently drove through eternity . Bass squats close , contemplating 10-96 . " Notice the discoloration , the markings , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's on his stomach now , but he died on his back . " Bass draws that conclusion because , at death , the blood settled into the back of the body . Bass reaches down and expertly flips the body over , and the arms flop across the chest . Rigor mortis has left . Two days earlier the temperature had risen to the 50s , warm enough so that flies were busy hunting for somewhere to lay eggs . " Here 's something by the nostrils , " says Bass . " And here in the eyes . They go for moist areas . " The eggs look like finely grated cheese laid out in a quarterinch line . Larvae already // Invasion of the Insects // hatched from other eggs have moved deep inside the body and are now massing together for warmth . On frigid days of midwinter , Bass sometimes notices steam rising from his collection . On this particular morning , though , we see no signs of insect activity . For that , a half year earlier , I had visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chung Kim and graduate student Dave Skipper . A 36-year-old with long , curly hair and a three-day growth of beard , Skipper acquired his passion for insects as a pest-control worker , and his interest in forensics from Kim . Penn State is one of the few institutions offering advanced courses related to forensic entomology . Kim and Skipper had selected as their research subject a 50-pound pig whose nearly hairless body would decay much like that of a human . Drugged to eliminate pain , the pig was shot dead ( 61 percent of U.S. homicides are by gunshot ) on a hot day in May . It fell on a grassy knoll in full sunlight . And then , just 87 seconds after death , the first fly arrived , an iridescent green blowfly . It homed in on the bullet hole , then buzzed over to walk up a nostril . The fly had soared in slowly , awkwardly-a gravid female , Skipper assumed , frantic to lay her eggs , so heavy that she was having trouble flying . In 10 minutes she was joined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , genitals . Later would arrive males , then virgin females who , over the following days , virgins no more , would engage in what 's called " egg-laying frenzy . " How can a fly so quickly find the body ? She smells the blood , or if there 's no wound , the gases that begin to expel from body openings . She can sniff these odors from at least a mile away . The smells , explains Columbia University odor expert Stuart Firestein , float in tiny packets of molecules on the wind , in bunches that tend to stay clumped . A fly surges upwind in a sinuous path from clump to clump ; the packets become more frequent as she nears the corpse . Soon the " death contemporary " odors are augmented by the unmistakable stench of decay caused by the perfectly named chemicals cadaverine and putrescine . The smell is of primordial import both to insect and human . To insects it means dinner and a waiting nursery . To humans it means poison : Do n't eat ! The warning could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back on what he called " the crime scene . " Wearing a black " Entomology and Death " T-shirt , he strode across the field , a satchel of instruments on one shoulder , a camera on the other , a butterfly net in his right hand , and a foot-long thermometer in the left . " Now here we have Pig Doe , " he said into a tape recorder , then noted general conditions . At first glance , nothing seemed to have changed since the first visit-but in fact , much had . The pig had gone through rigor mortis and Liver mortis , and under the hair , on the mottled skin , stretched row upon row of those grated-cheese eggs . And if you looked closely into the smiling mouth , you could see a pulsing mass of maggots down in the throat . Maggots were also working the wound-a useful item for investigators to keep in mind . ( Later , at the Body Farm , Bass would show me slides of a woman whose body seemed largely intact except for her right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by maggots . Bass had concluded that she was struck on the cheek with some weapon while trying to ward off a blow , and flies had been attracted to both wounds . Eventually , a worker who put on the woman 's roof was convicted . He had struck her with his shingle gun . ) Photograph Bass studies the bones of one of his 800 subjects . which are stored in boxes beneath the University of Tennessee 's stadium . Photograph Bass checks on the progress of a decaying body down on the farm . // Skipper 's pig seemed fatter on this visit , its skin stretched and shiny . " Bloat , " Skipper offered . " The intestinal bacteria are working on the organs , producing additional sulfides . " The maggot mass was adding bulk as well , and the combination swelled the stomach , pushing the intestines partially out the anus . Skipper carefully turned the body over , and suddenly a wave of putrescence rose around us , wringing our stomachs and gagging our throats . That night I imagined I could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination . The molecules of that odor are sticky , and they had attached themselves to my nose hairs . To get rid of the smell , investigators in this line of work have learned to sniff a little water . Another week and we were back again , and this timeinside a wire-mesh cage to protect it from predators-the pig looked well dead . Its lips had been eaten away , transforming faint smile to leer . Sometime earlier the bloat had become so pronounced the belly had split , spewing organs . If you 're there at just the right time , I 'm told , you sometimes can hear the rip . If at this point you kick the corpse , it will suddenly heave , almost as though alive . That 's the point : At a shock , the maggots , all together at once , hunch . That 's to scare off a predator . With his foot-long thermometer , Skipper measured the belly temperature deep in the maggot mass : 79 deg F. Sometimes the internal temperature rises to 125 deg . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 1/2 feet aboveground ( the standard height of a weather station ) , comparing them later with weather-service readings from the nearest station . Using official figures , he then constructs a temperature profile over the weeks , correlating that with known insect growth rates . Squatting by the pig , forceps in hand , Skipper began plucking maggots and plopping them into alcohol vials . Some he dropped into plastic dessert cups already supplied with a beef-liver dinner . These will be raised to maturity back at the lab . A good entomologist can determine maggot species by dissection , but it 's much easier to identify adults . " Insects are attracted to carrion in waves-faunal succession , ' it 's called , " says Skipper . " Look , here 's a rove beetle already . " First come the flies-blow , flesh , even house-to feast on the rich , soft meat . Ants may then march in to feed on the fly eggs . Dung flies or gnats are also early visitors . After the fly eggs hatch , the rove beetles appear to prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maggots . Carrion beetles , meanwhile , are chewing off hunks of flesh , injecting eggs , then burying them . Raccoons might take a few bites , and birds as well , dining not only on carrion , but maggot . Even ticks will be attracted , hoping to catch a ride on a visiting bird or mammal . When nothing is left but leather , bone , and sinew , those leavings lure tineids-common clothes moths-and dermestid beetles , the carpet " beetles found in rugs . In fact , museums sometimes raise dermestids to strip dried flesh from skeletons . Scientists speculate that the different insect waves are attracted by a rotting carcass 's changing scents . All told , scores of species could be involved , and Skipper 's job is to sort through what he knows about their biological clocks , then apply his findings . " We know just when this pig was killed , " he says , " but for research purposes I 'm trying to establish the PMIthe post-mortem interval-theoretically . " Entomologists know the time that , say , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life under controlled laboratory conditions . But the formulas are n't so refined when such things as temperature fluctuations , shade , rain , day length , and clothing are factored into the equation . Gradually , though , as forensic investigators pool their findings , time estimates are becoming increasingly accurate . But things like drugs continue to skew results . Neal Haskell-the only American supporting himself solely through forensic entomology-tells of the time he was examining a corpse and was startled to find a maggot big enough that it should have been at least 10 days old . But the victim had been seen alive only a week earlier . Haskell found the maggot in a nostril , and later he learned that the deceased had snorted cocaine 6 hours before he died . M. Lee Goff , a University of Hawaii entomologist , finds that use of heroin and other drugs can be verified by analyzing maggots put through a blender . The work of forensic entomology typically takes place in a lab , using insect evidence gathered by police on the scene . In the entomology lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small , cardboard box newly arrived from Allentown . It contained half a dozen plastic food dishes and a handful of condom-size test tubes , each with a dated label : " Maggots from upper back area , " " From anus-aprx 20 ; 0900 hrs , " " Beetles collected on ground under body . " Kim , surveying the samples , was delighted . " This is one of the rare times when collecting was done perfectly , " he says . " I 'm especially pleased because the deputy coroner who sent these attended our class last time . " Each summer , Kim offers a three-day workshop that teaches law-enforcement officers how to collect insect clues at crime scenes . Few police departments can afford to carry entomologists on their payrolls , Kim explains , so investigators must be trained to find evidence , which can then be sent to an expert . // Flies are usually the first insects to arrive at the scene of a murdersometimes within seconds of death . // On this day , the immediate challenge to Kim and Skipper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If everything is done properly and accurately , " says Kim , " you should be able to tell the time of death within a range of maybe 5 to 6 hours . " And depending on what kind of insects entomologists find , they could answer other questions as well . For instance , has the body been moved ? The insects of South Carolina are n't necessarily those of Pennsylvania , and the insects of urban areas can be surprisingly different from those of nearby rural areas . Lice can mean that a corpse had been a street person or someone living in a crowded nursing home . Back out in the field again-it had been nearly two weeks since Pig Doe 's demise-the change was startling . The carcass had undergone what entomologists call exodus . The deceased had collapsed to a pile of bones layered with scabby skin . The skull , severed now from the body by its own weight , still held the malevolent grin . Most of the meat , transformed first into living maggots , was now resting underground in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exodus-about 19 days after maggot hatch-a corpse loses between 80 and 90 percent of its weight . The maggots flee the body to avoid predators , pushing themselves through the soil up to 25 feet away . So massive is the migration that in short grass on rocky soil they can leave " maggot trails , " sometimes mistaken for tire tracks . Underground in the dark-and often in a cadaver 's pocket , collar fold , or trouser cuff-they encase themselves to drift through the pupal stage , and sometimes are mistaken by investigators for rat droppings . When last I visited Skipper 's pig , fall leaves had blown over the carcass , and only the skull poked through the mat , still leering . Back at the Body Farm , insects are stripping the last bits of flesh from " 10-96 . " This winter his bones will join the hundreds of others in those catacombs under the stadium .

Photograph A wire cage protects the decomposing " Pig Doe " from scavengers . Sidebar What Happens After Death WHEN A BODY DIES , it does so slowly . A shot through the heart immediately stops blood flow , and the brain ceases to function a few minutes later . But cells of muscle , skin , and bone live on-dying only when metabolic waste products build up , sometimes days later . Upon death , the body temperature begins to drop at about 2.5 deg F an hour . The muscles relax , and the skin sags into new shapes . Blood settles in body parts closest to the ground , turning the top grayish white and darkening the underside , except where pressed to the ground . The resulting liver-colored stain , liver mortis , is most pronounced about 10 hours after death . Within 6 hours , rigor mortis sets in : The eyelids stiffen , then the neck and jaw , and finally the remaining muscles . ( The reason , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and protein coagulation . ) After roughly a day , the muscles slowly relax again in the same sequence that they stiffened . MeanwhiLe , bacteria have eaten through the gut . The first sign is usually a greenish patch marbling blood vessels on the lower right belly . The putrefaction spreads across the stomach , down the thighs , over the chest . The skin changes to olive to eggplant to black . The bacteria produce gas that bulges the eyes , protrudes the tongue , and pushes blood-stained fluid from orifices . That 's why coffins are constructed with lids that can burp . A week after death finds the skin Loosened and covered with large , putrid blisters . Hand skin can slough off like a glove , taking the fingerprints with it . A few weeks later , the hair , teeth , and nails begin to loosen , sometimes to fall out . Some of the organs start to liquefy ; others , such as the prostate , may remain intact for a yeat .
