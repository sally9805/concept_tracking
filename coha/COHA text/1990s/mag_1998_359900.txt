Film directors do n't always deliver when they make music videos . Gus Van Sant 's goofily dark vision of Hanson 's Weird was interesting , and Martin Scorsese 's story line for Michael Jackson 's Bad was pretty good , but Brian De Palma 's Dancing in the Dark was kind of silly , and Abel Ferrara 's upcoming effort for the Phoids looks like an overly earnest drug documentary . Paul Thomas Anderson ( Boogie Nights ) has beaten them all with this black-and-white , slow-motion interpretation of Apple 's dreamy Beatles cover from the Pleasantville sound track . While a makeup-free Apple dreamily croons in a ' 50s diner , mod-looking boys in steel-toe boots trash the place . Sure , we 've seen the juxtaposition of music and violence before , but rarely done so well . <P>  --  By Joel Stein
