From THE WHOLE SHEBANG Photograph From THE WHOLE SHEBANG // Like the Arabic invention of the zero or Einstein 's realization that a falling man feels no force of gravity , inflation is a simple idea with multiple implications . Baldly stated , the inflationary hypothesis does n't sound like much . It asserts that the infant universe underwent a spasm of exponential expansion , a fraction of a second during which it repeatedly doubled its radius over equal intervals of time . ( During exponential expansion the radius of the universe increased with each tick of the clock as R = 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 . . . ) This historic hiccup was over within 10sup-34second , an interval compared to which the blink of an eye is an eternity . Thereafter the universe settled into the linear expansion rate ( R = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . . . ) that has characterized it ever since . Yet inflation may well rank among the most productive ideas of modern cosmology . It provides a physical explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe started expanding in the first place . It cures the classic big bang model of its most troubling intrinsic difficulties : the flatness problem , which refers to the universe 's eerie closeness to critical density , and the horizon problem , which relates to the puzzling fact that matter is distributed evenly over the universe 's entire expanse  --  despite the fact that this distance is too vast for information to have traversed it since the Big Bang . // Big Bang With Inflation // Although the inflationary " epoch " was unimaginably brief , its consequences were literally enormous . During inflation , the radius of the universe would have multiplied many times . At the start of inflation , the universe was smaller than a proton . But if you keep doubling even a minute quantity , it soon gets big . The concept of exponential increase has long been illustrated by the story about a young man who persuades a mathematically challenged monarch to reward him if he succeeds in rescuing the king 's lost daughter . The reward is to be amassed by placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two pennies on the second square , four on the third , and so on , until all the squares on the board are covered . Once his daughter is returned , the king learns to his horror that the reward is more than he can come up with ; indeed , it is far more than the total wealth of all the civilizations in the history of the world . Even if we take a modest inflationary model , one in which the universe balloons to only about the size of a medicine ball , the familiar , linear expansion that follows will double that radius another 90 times or so over the course of the next 10 billion years , yielding a universe that today is much larger than it would have been had inflation never taken place . And if we use the estimates of chaotic inflation , the figures become truly Brobdingnagian . Chaotic inflation is the work of cosmologist Andrei Linde , now at Stanford University . When Linde was first developing chaotic inflation , he explained the theory to me by jotting down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radius of the universe . Using a thick , felt-tipped black pen , he first wrote a 10 , then an exponent of 10 , then raised that by another factor of 12 . This was the largest number I 'd ever seen . It beggared the term " astronomical . " It is equal to a 1 followed by a trillion zeros . Had Linde written a 1 followed by a trillion zeros on a strip of ticker tape , the paper would girdle the Earth two dozen times . To print it here for the reader 's edification , in small type , would require that this magazine be millions of volumes in length - the capacity of a good university library . Gaping at Linde 's 10 to the tenth to the twelfth , I asked one of the stupidest questions of my life : " In what units is that expressed ? " I inquired . " I mean , is it centimeters ? Light-years ? Parsecs ? Hubble radii ? " Linde laughed . " Well , " he replied , " when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't really matter what units you 're using . " Actually he had in mind the radius of the universe in centimeters , but the point is that the inflationary universe is not just big but , as the variety show host Ed Sullivan liked to say , " really big . " Now , while " the universe " comprises , by definition , the totality of all the regions that are potentially observable by us , the observable universe is restricted to the region from which light signals have already had time to reach us . In the classical big bang picture , this distinction was not terribly important ; in that model the observable universe amounted , depending on the geometric particulars , to something like 75 to 90 percent of the entire universe . But because the universe in the inflationary model is gigantic , the observable part of it is only a tiny fraction of the whole . One important effect of this radically altered relationship between the size of the observable universe and that of the universe as a whole is to flatten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat , meaning that omega the ratio of the amount of matter required to close the universe versus the amount of matter that is actually contained in the universe - is approximately one . This fact is inexplicable in the classic big bang model . To make cosmic geometry come out that way would have required extraordinary fine-tuning of the initial conditions : The primordial value of omega had to be set to one within one part in 10su . God might have been up to it , but why should he have gone to the trouble ? Attention was drawn to the flatness problem by James Peebles and Robert Dicke at Princeton back in 1979 , but no solution could be found within the classical model . Inflation provides a straightforward explanation of why cosmic space should appear to be flat . The classical big bang model , since it envisioned the observable universe as constituting the lion 's share of the entire universe , permitted observers to behold the global geometry of space . Their situation was rather like that of comic strip characters standing on a small spherical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the planet is curved and can easily measure the extent of its curvature . But because the inflation ary universe is much bigger , any observer perceives the surface ( i.e. , the shape of space ) as flat . To illustrate this effect , imagine that you are a geographer in ancient Athens and you want to measure the curvature of Earth . You spend a few days down at the docks estimating how far ships have to sail out to sea before they disappear over the horizon . Soon you have derived a plausible estimate of the curvature of Earth 's surface . This represents the classic big bang theory , in which we can see most of the entire universe and so can measure the curvature of cosmic space . Now inflate Earth a zillion times . ( Actually many zillions , but enough of that . ) The horizon appears to be perfectly flat - you can not measure any curvature : outgoing ships shrink to dots but never disappear even though the bloated Earth remains spherical . That 's how inflation solves the flatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately is open , closed , or flat , it appears to be flat , since we can not see enough of it to discern its true curvature . Similarly , inflation resolves a major problem that beset the classic big bang model - the riddle of why the universe should exhibit homogeneity , meaning that matter on the large scale is distributed evenly ; and isotropy , meaning that matter on the large scale is distributed in comparable ways in all directions . Both difficulties arise from the relationship between the observable universe and the entire universe in the classic model . Since the observable universe is the region within which information can have been exchanged , it also defines the largest area within which cause and effect can have operated . // Big Bang Without Inflation // The trouble was that in the standard big bang model , given the velocity of light and the age of the universe , objects on opposite sides of the observable universe could never have been in physical contact nor otherwise have exchanged information with one another . If that were the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of the sky today would be looking at disconnected and dissimilar regions ; indeed , the two regions would be separated from each other by 90 discrete horizons . Not only would they reside outside of each other 's observable universe , but 88 observable universes would lie between them . Trying to get a message across the classical big bang universe would have been harder than sending a letter through 90 nations , none of which handled the postal traffic of any of the others . In fact , it would have been impossible . Yet the cosmic background radiation looks much the same all over the sky . How did photons from one region of the universe ever " learn " that they were to emit at exactly the same temperature as photons in another region of the universe ? How did electrons on one side of the universe learn how to be identical to the electrons on the other side ? This is the horizon problem . At fAt glance , tnition would seem to make the horizon problem worse , since it postulates a more rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inflation eliminates the horizon problem . It does this in two ways . First , since inflation need not have begun at time zero , it permits scenarios in which the primordial material remained concentrated long enough to mix before inflation got under way . Second , inflation delivers a homogeneous universe by getting rid of primordial lumps . Suppose you are observing the Alps . You note that they are lumpy . Now inflate Earth to a zillion times its former radius . The Alps are still there , but the horizontal dimension has increased so radically that you do n't notice them . Even if you were standing on Matterhorn 's peak , your surroundings would now look as flat as a tabletop . No more lumps . So all observers in post-inflationary universes find that matter on large scales is distributed homogeneously . As Linde writes , " Inflation remains the only theory which explains why the observable part of the universe is almost homogeneous . " // Without Inflation // While accounting for the smoothness of the universe , inflation also handily predicts its departure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of galaxies - on a level consistent with what astronomers using the COBE satellite have observed in the cosmic microwave background ( about one part in a hundred thousand ) . That 's because inflation would have amplified random , subatomic quantum fluctuations in the early universe , producing the inhomogeneities seen in the COBE data . Left to themselves , these quantum fluctuations would quickly have subsided , to be replaced by others in the perpetually restless shuffle that characterizes the quantum world . But inflation freezes them in , bequeathing them to the post-inflationary universe as the seeds of large scale structure . The mechanism hinges on the relationship between the wavelength of a given field ( such as an electromagnetic field ) and the length of the Hubble radius . ( The Hubble radius is that of the observable universe ; it defines the zone of causal contact at a given moment in cosmic history . Today its length is roughly 15 billion light-years . During inflation , it was only a fraction of a light-second . ) As the universe inflates , the fields carrying quantum flux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given fluctuation exceeds the Hubble radius , its amplitude freezes while its wavelength continues to grow . At the end of inflation , such a frozen field emerges looking like a classical field , creating inhomogeneities in the cosmic distribution of mass . So inflation evidently can deliver both the local lumpiness and the global smoothness that characterize the universe we live in . As a final advertisement , I should mention that inflation does away with the magnetic monopole problem . In the early universe , the vacuum of space underwent phase transitions , much as boiling water evaporates into steam . These phase transitions broke a hypothetical primordial force into the four forces manifest today - the electromagnetic force , the nuclear strong and weak forces , and gravity . Such a universe would have been fraught with socalled Higgs fields , which are said to have endowed particles with mass . Knots in the Higgs fields should have generated lots of magnetic monopoles . These are massive particles that have only one magnetic pole ( all other known particles have two poles : a negative and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well established in theory , monopoles are alluring objects , little onions whose anachronistic layers retain the primordial physics that ruled the early moments of the universe . The trouble is that in the classical big bang picture there were far too many of them . The calculated monopole density would have made the universe dense enough to halt cosmic expansion only 30,000 years after the Big Bang . Inflation obviates this difficulty by diluting the density of monopoles and sweeping those few that are produced to regions far outside the horizon of the observable universe . Enormous numbers of monopoles could have arisen in the inflationary universe , yet we and all other observers would find them to be rarer than snowballs in the Sahara . Calculations suggest that inflation would spread them so thin that the average observer could expect to find only a single monopole in the entire observable universe . In part because it resolves so many problems , inflation seems a good bet to become part of the standard big bang cosmology - or , more properly , to paint a broader picture within which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Berkeley astrophysicist Joseph Silk exaggerates less than one might think when he asserts that " inflation is the only new idea in cosmology since Einstein . " It is general in scope , interfacing adeptly between the classical physics of general relativity and the quantum physics of subatomic particles and fields . It resonates well with string theory , since both would build the foundations of the cosmos out of space itself . It offers adept explanations of why the universe is isotropic and homogeneous ( the stretching of a wrinkled balloon ) and how galaxies nevertheless came into being ( they were seeded by density perturbations that originated in quantum flux ) . Inflation has already made two testable predictions , that the cosmic matter density should be critical ( as it is confirmed to be , within a factor of 10 ) and that the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations should be scale invariant ( as was detected in the cosmic microwave background by the COBE satellite ) . And , always important in science as in art , the inflationary hypothesis is fecund ; it raises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not groundlessly of inflation as " a new cosmological paradigm . . . much more interesting and complicated than what we have expected .
