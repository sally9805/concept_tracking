<p> You do n't need a weatherman to tell you which way the wind is blowing . A copy of the bestseller list will do just fine . <p> Take " Guns , Crime , and Freedom , " brought out by the D.C. firm of Regnery Publishing . Once you know the book was written by Wayne LaPierre , the head of the National Rifle Association , you can easily guess its message . ( Sample sentence : " Clearly , the Warsaw ghetto stands in history as a shining example of the dangers of gun control . " ) <p> What no one reckoned on was the message 's popularity . Regnery started with around 20,000 copies last summer and now has 10 times that number in print . The biggest success in the publisher 's 47-year history , " Guns " recently spent two weeks on the New York Times bestseller list  --  an unusual place to find such a partisan look at such a hot-button issue . HarperCollins just bought paperback rights for a significant six-figure sum . <p> " This is about freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedom . And people do n't want to lose it , " declares LaPierre . He adds that " people are totally fed up with the misreporting of this issue in the national media . " <p> His hand is sore . He 's done 82 book-signings in the past few months , ranging all over the country with the exception of a few gun control strongholds like the District and New York City . A couple hundred folks have been showing up at each . <p> One man 's truth , of course , is another fellow 's propaganda , but the prevalence of **46;385;TOOLONG truth on the bestseller list these days is overwhelming . Meanwhile , Democratic propaganda is about as fashionable as a panhandler at a picnic . <p> " For some reason , liberals are no longer able to talk about the world around us in a way that really gets people in their guts , " says John Sterling , editor in chief at Houghton Mifflin . " But conservatives sure can . It 's happening in Washington in Congress , and it 's happening nationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the last unabashedly liberal books , Al Gore 's " Earth in the Balance . " " Was that only in 1992 ? " he asks . " It seems like a decade ago . " <p> The tide has turned , the editor says . " If you were a publisher who just wanted to pick winners , you 'd say : Let 's sign up people who have great TV programs "  --  a reference to the huge success of books by comics Tim Allen , Paul Reiser and Jerry Seinfeld  --  " and conservatives who have terrific media profiles . " <p> And if you got a conservative with a terrific media profile and a popular radio and TV program , you could clean up . Which is exactly what Simon and Schuster has done with Rush Limbaugh . <p> Says Adam Bellow , editorial director of the Free Press : " The liberal monopoly on public debate has weakened . I 'm always being asked , ' What manipulative magic did you use to create this audience for conservative books ? ' But the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conservative ideas were walled off in a ghetto . " <p> The List Speaks Volumes <p> Consider some further evidence : William Bennett 's " Book of Virtues , " a compendium of moralizing fables , has been on the New York Times list for nearly a year . Dan Quayle 's book was a bigger hit than anticipated . Richard Nixon 's last book spent four times longer on the list than Jimmy Carter 's . Barbara Bush has racked up 14 weeks and counting for her latest , vs. 0 and falling for Rosalynn Carter . The massive popularity of the No. 1 fiction bestseller " Politically Correct Bedtime Stories " underlines the rapid progression of political correctness from liberal mantra to joke . Then , of course , there 's the chart-topping nonfiction offering by Pope John Paul II  --  not exactly anyone 's idea of a leftist . <p> Still not convinced ? Check out the fate of Mr. Anti-Family Values himself , Marlon Brando . His $ 5 million , heavily hyped , years-in-the-making autobiography arrived with a clunk in September . Even slashing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wants to hear Brando 's opinions about the fate of the Indians . No one wants to read Peter Manso 's weighty biography of him either . <p> Instead , they want " The Bell Curve , " Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein 's 845-page opus on " intelligence and class structure in American life . " Touted on its dust jacket as " certain to ignite an explosive controversy , " the book was attacked by most of the mainstream media as an ill-mannered , ill-conceived , statistically flawed , crypto-racist manifesto . There are now 400,000 copies in print , the biggest success in the Free Press 's five decades and one of the most academic titles ever to make it to the upper reaches of the list . ( Sample sentence : " The average validity in the meta-analysis of the GATB studies was .45 . " ) <p> " It 's something I 've seen again and again , " says the publisher , Bellow . " All you really need to get a book going  --  at least , a conservative book  --  is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you talk to the mavens of the New York publishing world , they say " The Bell Curve " is this year 's great unread bestseller , following in the footsteps of Stephen Hawking 's " A Brief History of Time , " Allan Bloom 's " The Closing of the American Mind , " Paul Kennedy 's " Rise and Fall of the Great Powers " and the novels of Umberto Eco . <p> " It 's like buying a piece of exercise equipment , " says one editor . " You do it with the best of intentions , but it never gets used . " <p> Bellow rejects such assertions . " That attitude reflects a certain degree of contempt for the reading public , " he says . <p> He figures three distinct groups are buying it and maybe even reading it . " I do n't deny that people bought the book because it was controversial , and I do n't even deny that some people bought the book just because they agreed with what they thought was in it , but a sizable number bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Selling Points <p> Adam Bellow himself is the best proof of the conservative ascension in publishing . The 37-year-old son of Nobel laureate Saul , he 's the hottest editor in New York . <p> Bellow has been running the Free Press since Erwin Glikes , the autocrat who built it into one of the country 's major outlets of conservative intellectual thought , abruptly quit last spring . ( Glikes did n't want to go to work for Dick Snyder , the autocrat who ruled Simon and Schuster . S &S; had just bought Macmillan , which owned the Free Press , but Glikes had had a heart attack years ago when he worked for Snyder and was n't keen on having another one . He decamped to Viking Penguin , but a couple of weeks later had a fatal heart attack anyway . A couple weeks after that , Snyder was fired by the new owners of S &S.); <p> With the success of " The Bell Curve , " members of the journalistic Establishment are competing to interview Bellow . " Much as I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid I ca n't , " he says . " This book created its own publicity . " <p> Yet publicity does n't necessarily cause people to buy books . If things were that simple , all three of the recent books about Charles and Diana would be on the list , which they assuredly are not . But at least publicity alerts booksellers and wholesalers that there may be demand for a particular title . Then , if customers want to take it home with them , they 'll be able to find it . <p> " Some might say nine-tenths of selling large numbers of copies of any book is just getting it into the stores , " says Bellow . <p> It 's that other tenth that 's tricky . Witness the example of " Strange Justice , " the book on Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill released in early November in a fireburst of publicity that approached that of " The Bell Curve . " Within 24 hours , for instance , Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson 's work was touted on three different ABC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies in print , spent three weeks on the bestseller list . As Houghton Mifflin 's Sterling , the book 's editor , points out , this is an achievement in itself . " It 's very hard to get any book of substance onto the bestseller list . Just look at it . " <p> Still , he concedes that " I can certainly say that on November 2 , when this started breaking , I thought we had a major bestseller on our hands . I thought it would translate into huge sales . Instead , it translated into very good sales . " <p> Because the book concludes that Anita Hill was telling the truth about Clarence Thomas , it 's perceived as " liberal . " That 's opposed to the " conservative " approach of Mayer and Abramson nemesis David Brock , who penned " The Real Anita Hill " 18 months ago . <p> Brock 's book , which attacked Hill and supported Thomas , was an unexpected success . If " Strange Justice " is lucky and sells 70 percent of its print-run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the 115,000 achieved by " The Real Anita Hill . " <p> As it happens , " The Real Anita Hill " was edited by Adam Bellow . And it , like " The Bell Curve , " was attacked on publication , which as usual only helped . Once again , some people read it to see what all the noise was about , while for others it offered a point of view they found sympathetic  --  and which had n't received much air time by the mainstream media . <p> " Strange Justice , " in Bellow 's view , suffered in the marketplace from the fact that " it just confirms ruling prejudices . People do n't really need it . Erwin Glikes always used to say that no one would buy a book that said astrology is n't true . The people who believe in astrology are n't going to be convinced , and the people who do n't believe in it do n't need to be convinced . " After " Strange Justice " received its generally approving nods in the media , in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it to go . <p> The theory that people do n't want to read about liberal politics is n't airtight . At first glance , it does n't account for the problematic success of " All 's Fair , " the Mary Matalin-James Carville duet . If the Democrats were rejected in last month 's election , why would anyone want to hear from a leading Democratic campaign consultant ? And even if the Republicans are resurgent , George Bush is n't . So why would anyone want to hear from the political director of his ill-fated 1992 campaign ? <p> But they did . " All 's Fair " has 200,000 copies in print and had a good run on the bestseller list . The book was skillfully presented not as politics , but as show biz . " Both authors , " says their editor , Random House 's David Rosenthal , " have transcended politics to become entertainers , and celebrities . The Hepburn-Tracy comparison held . " <p> Except in the city that knows the pair best : Washington . Sales here , at least by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last spring , Crown Publishers ran ads for " Lethal Passage : How the Travels of a Single Handgun Expose the Roots of America 's Gun Crisis . " National Rifle Association members were offered a $ 2 rebate if they sent in the receipt for the book and a copy of their membership card . <p> The number of responses , says publicist Andrew Martin , was " fewer than 10 . " <p> " That showed us that no NRA members were interested in looking at a book that took careful aim at the business of guns in America , " says Martin . ( Either that , he concedes , " or they did n't need $ 2 . " ) <p> " Lethal Passage , " by Wall Street Journal reporter Erik Larson , got good reviews and some attention during the crime bill debate , but it sold only modestly . <p> " People who hate guns do n't want to read about them because they know they already hate them , " says Larson . " They 're delighted a book like mine , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really feel they have to go out and read it . <p> " Whereas one thing that characterizes people who love guns is that they love to read about them . Especially after the last few years , they need to read something that reinforces their belief that owning a gun does n't make you a homicidal maniac . " <p> It 's highly unusual for single-issue books that are closely affiliated with a particular special-interest group to appear even briefly on the Times bestseller list . For one thing , if a special-interest organization produces a book , it 's usually sold through channels  --  direct mail , conventions , specialty stores  --  that do n't report to the bestseller list . <p> " Guns , Crime and Freedom " has instead gone the mainstream route . Al Regnery , the head of Regnery Publishing , says the NRA has bought only a few copies directly . In fact , author LaPierre argues , the only thing that connects the book with the NRA is him  --  " the book was done independently of the NRA and published independently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no doubt the NRA has supported the book . " That includes mailings to members announcing signings , and some television " infomercials . " <p> Two sorts of customers have been coming in for the book at the Waldenbooks in Town East Square in Wichita , says manager Doug Waring . NRA members ask for it by author and name . Others just say they 've heard about a new book about guns , and does the store stock it ? <p> So the book 's sales stem in part from an endorsement of its views , and in part from straightforward curiosity . And maybe some old-fashioned salesmanship . At the Wichita signing  --  the store 's best in at least two years , by the way  --  LaPierre shook everyone 's hand , talked to them , graciously inscribed their books . <p> " He made good personal contact , " says Waring . " Most authors do n't treat people half as nice as he does .

Three who have hit it particularly big : Clockwise from left , talk show host Rush Limbaugh , NRA head Wayne LaPierre and former education secretary Bill Bennett .
