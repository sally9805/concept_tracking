<p> " Whatever we do , it 's got to get better than it 's been . " - New England Patriots receiver Irving Fryar , Oct. 6 . FOXBORO , Mass. - Four days after that comment , Fryar was arrested on a weapons charge after an early-morning brawl outside a bar . <p> In his seventh year with the Patriots , Fryar should have known better . Things can always get worse in Foxboro , and usually do . <p> The nationally publicized troubles of the last month are just another chapter in the volume of self-inflicted wounds suffered by the National Football League 's most star-crossed franchise . <p> If Paul Revere had been a modern-day Patriot , he would have been given an 11 p.m. curfew . Or arrested for disturbing the peace . <p> Such is the 31-year history of the franchise , and never have fortunes been lower . The team is 1-5 , playing to just two-thirds capacity at 60,000-seat Foxboro Stadium and facing the 5-1 Buffalo Bills Sunday . <p> Except for three magic weeks in the 1985 season when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowl , the Patriots have won one playoff game ( 1963 ) . Even the Super Bowl was spoiled by a 46-10 loss to Chicago and revelations of drug use on the team the next day . <p> This year , the news is all bad : <p> - The NFL has hired an independent counsel to investigate allegations of sexual harassment by five players of Boston Herald reporter Lisa Olson and the front office 's response to her allegations . <p> - Two weeks ago , Fryar and Hart Lee Dykes , the starting wide receivers , were in a brawl at 1 : 20 a.m. outside a Providence , R.I. , nightclub . Dykes suffered an eye injury and Fryar was charged with possession of a loaded , semi-automatic pistol without a Rhode Island permit . <p> - The team is off to its worst start since the 2-14 season of 1981 and on the verge of recording its first back-to-back losing seasons in 17 years . <p> " I 've never been in a situation like this , never been down this far , " said cornerback Ronnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-the-field problems have prompted speculation the team is eyeing a move . Not everyone would mourn the loss . <p> Boston Globe columnist Bob Ryan suggested the team leave promptly so Boston can line up an expansion franchise . <p> " Psst , Memphis . Yo , Jacksonville . How 'd you like a football team ? On behalf of 3 million residents of Greater Boston , I think I can safely say you are welcome to ours , " he wrote . But , he added , " if you 're looking for professionalism and class ... then perhaps you 'd better wait for an expansion team . " <p> Victor Kiam , this month marking his second anniversary as majority owner , says it 's just rumor : " I have n't talked to anybody about anything in that regard . " <p> Most fans probably do n't agree with Ryan , but it 's apparent the image and standing of the Patriots in the community is at an all-time low . <p> " It 's better than nothing , but close , " said Scott Saklad , manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park in Boston . <p> Saklad said Boston pro teams typically account for 60%-70% of his sales from their respective sports . " With the Patriots , we 're lucky to do 10% . I ca n't give away Patriots stuff . " <p> When the Pats played the Miami Dolphins last Thursday , the game finished fourth in Boston TV ratings behind The Simpsons , The Cosby Show and a debate between gubernatorial candidates . <p> " It 's a long-running soap opera - Fryar , Dykes and J.R . Ewing , " said Larry Thompson of Boston . " It 's the manual of how not to run a pro football team . " <p> NFL investigator Philip Heymann has interviewed every Patriots player - some twice - and members of the front office about the Olson incident . <p> General manager Patrick Sullivan , interviewed by investigators for 5 1/2 hours Monday , said Heymann hopes to submit a formal report to Commissioner Paul Tagliabue by the end of the month . <p> Sullivan , son of former owner Billy Sullivan , reportedly was about to be fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He acknowledged there were " discussions " with Kiam about a suspension , but he has no intention of resigning . Sullivan reportedly has a contract averaging $ 400,000 a year through 1995 . <p> The Olson incident , coupled with a neck injury to starting quarterback Steve Grogan , sent the team into a free-fall after an encouraging start ( 1-1 , the loss by three points to Miami ) . They 've lost four in a row , the first three by an average of 24 points . <p> " If they were a winning team like the 49ers , if Jerry Rice did the things Irving Fryar did , no one would care , " Saklad said . <p> " Football players are not paid to be gentlemen , " said fan Peter Howard of Walpole . " But I think Victor Kiam , as a businessman , handled it poorly . " <p> Kiam refuses comment on the investigation or whether he 'll proceed with his threatened shake-up of management . <p> He denies calling Olson a " classic bitch " and claims a Boston columnist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The columnist said he heard only the last part of it , but named two other reporters who said they heard the magic words ) . <p> Kiam says his comment that the incident was " a flyspeck in the ocean " came at the end of a 90-minute interview when he was trying to get off the phone . <p> " Personally , I always felt I had n't done anything wrong , " he said . " I 'm a big boy . I got whacked a little bit . I think it was unfair , but that 's life . " <p> President of Remington Products Inc. , Kiam says he wo n't know until the Christmas season whether protests of women 's groups will affect sales of shavers . <p> He said he is " not troubled " by the current image of the club . " If you have a winning team , you win public support . " <p> That could take time . <p> Coach Rod Rust , in his first season , already is being roasted on the talk- show circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-guessed his decision to keep ineffective quarterback Marc Wilson in the game though Grogan was well enough to play . <p> Despite the blunders and misfortune , the Patriots have generally fielded competitive teams . Since 1974 , they 've had only three losing seasons . <p> Acceptance generally is a three-game winning streak away . Perhaps , it 'll be that easy this time . Perhaps not . <p> " We visit a lot of schools and different charities to get fans to see we 're natural people ... We 're not macho-type people with bad attitudes and terrible manners , " Lippett said . " This hurts , it hurts tremendously .
