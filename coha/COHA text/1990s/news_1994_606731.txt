<p> Total hip replacement  --  the most commonly performed orthopedic reconstructive surgery for adults  --  reduces chronic pain , increases mobility and independence and is credited with greatly improving the quality of life for thousands of people , an expert panel concluded last week . <p> In this era of cost-consciousness , the artificial hips are even highly cost-effective , according to the panel , which was convened by the National Institutes of Health . <p> But the devices are still plagued by one chief problem : wear . <p> The various man-made materials used to make hips ca n't match the strength and durability of the bone that nature provides . The implants must be replaced every 10 to 15 years , although " there 's reason to expect that someday artificial hips will last as long as 30 years , " said David G. Murray , chairman of the NIH panel and head of orthopedic surgery at the State University of New York Health Sciences Center in Syracuse . <p> Last year , an estimated 123,000 hip replacements were performed in the United States . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise spend their remaining years aided by walkers or in wheelchairs . " I can confidently say to my patients ... that the outlook for you is excellent if you undergo this procedure , " said panel member Walter H. Ettinger , professor of internal medicine at Bowman Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem , N.C. <p> A growing number of younger people are also receiving artificial hips because of osteoarthritis , motorcycle and car accidents or the kind of spontaneous degeneration of the hip socket called avascular necrosis that prompted baseball and football star Bo Jackson to have a hip replacement in 1992 . <p> Increased durability of the materials used in artificial hips means that " we feel much more comfortable about doing this in younger people than before , " Murray said . The age of patients who can undergo the procedure is " virtually limitless , " Murray said . <p> Although all hip replacement patients experience wear problems , the increasing number of younger patients getting artificial hips and using them longer has produced problems with the gradual grinding down of the artificial joints , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a chain reaction in the body that can lead to significant bone loss . That increases the chance of fracture , which in turn results in more damage and the possibility of permanent disability . <p> For this reason , the panel recommended that people with artificial hips continue to be monitored regularly with X-rays and tests throughout their lives , an expense that many insurance companies do not cover . " The problem is that most patients are being written off after a year or less by insurance companies , " Murray said . Yet , without these regular tests , it is impossible to detect bone lysis , a serious loss of bone that often has no symptoms until it becomes catastrophic . <p> Ideally , Murray said , X-rays should be taken at the end of the first year following surgery , and " probably somewhere between three and five years later . " How frequently monitoring should occur thereafter varies from patient to patient . <p> " Bo Jackson might need to have it done more often , " Murray said . But annual X-rays are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said . <p> Total hip replacement was first introduced in 1962 . Since then , more than 800,000 artificial hips have been surgically performed in the United States . <p> The decision to implant an artificial hip is based on a variety of factors , from the amount of chronic pain that patients suffer to their ability to do such simple activities as walk or dress themselves . The panel found that nearly everyone who receives an artificial hip shows significant improvement afterward , justifying , it said , the average cost of $ 22,000 . Medicare picks up most of the cost for eligible recipients . <p> The hospital stay is about five to six days . But those who get an artificial hip walk on crutches for weeks after surgery and require at least several months of careful convalescence , including intensive physical therapy . <p> Implanting an artificial hip involves surgical removal of the diseased or damaged hip socket as well as the upper end of the thighbone , known as the femur , and a small portion of the pelvis , where the hip and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually made of metal , such as a titanium alloy , or the plastic polyethylene . This is attached to a rod-like extension that is inserted into the center of the thighbone . <p> One of the biggest debates among orthopedic surgeons focuses on which of the dozens of artificial hips to use and how best to attach them to the pelvis and thighbone . The first generation of artificial hips relied on a special cement to anchor the devices . But an NIH panel convened 12 years ago found an alarmingly high failure rate of these hips that was largely attributed to the type of cement used . <p> In the intervening years , many surgeons switched to a new generation of cementless artificial hips that are tightly wedged into the thighbone and sometimes also anchored with screws . Their porous surface can allow for some bony ingrowth . <p> Improvements have been made as well in cement , allowing a resurgence in the number of cemented artificial hip joints . Today , 55 percent of artificial hips are again cemented , " an earth-shattering change from just 2 1/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hip and Implant Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . <p> The switch is due not just to improved materials but to a better understanding of what causes the bone breakdown associated with artificial hips . The panel noted that each step taken by someone with an artificial hip releases on average 40,000 particles of the implant material , whether or not it contains cement . <p> These particles set in motion a reaction from the immune system that boosts production of a particular class of proteins known as cytokines . These substances in turn switch on cells that slowly eat away the hipbone and gradually weaken the site of the implant . <p> The process occurs at different rates in different people . But with time , it ultimately means the implant must be replaced , the panel said . <p> The current " benchmark " for the longest-lasting implants appears to be a hybrid variety , the panel said . It is anchored by cement to the thighbone and attached to a cementless socket that has been coated with a special porous material . Ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the section attached to the thighbone replaced and only 2 percent require replacement of the socket five years after surgery , the panel said . But these devices may not be the best choice for everyone , Murray stressed . Elderly patients may not have enough bone left to use the cementless socket . Younger patients often elect to go with completely cementless hips since the cemented variety can be more difficult to remove when the implant needs to be replaced 10 or 15 years after insertion . <p> In either case , however , hip replacements often make a difference to the people who receive them . Renee Crown , 65 , of Wilmette , Ill. , received her first hip replacement in 1986 after avascular necrosis turned most of one of her hip sockets to a sand-like substance . Her second hip had to be replaced with an artificial one for the same reason two years later . <p> Crown , who served on the NIH panel as a consumer representative , said she knows that because of her age she is likely to undergo a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five to 10 years . But the devices have enabled her to resume activities she otherwise had to forgo . Walking was painful . Dancing was out of the question . Even lying in bed was uncomfortable . <p> But today , Crown said , " I swim , I walk a couple of miles every day at a good gait , I play golf . These artificial hips are enough to keep me healthy and active . "
