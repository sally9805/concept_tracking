The day the shortstop died , Katie Mays was in the kitchen , arranging a sprig of baby 's breath , fresh from the garden , onto her father 's breakfast tray . Merely glancing at the front-page headlines , she opened the Daily Oklahoman to page five-sports scores and standings-and placed it neatly next to the cut-glass pitcher of orange juice . More important than Churchill and Stalin , that summer of 1941 , was the beginning of American Legion play downtown at Sandlot Park : baseball , not a war distant and exotic , was the reason she was waking her father a full hour earlier than usual . <p> The telephone in the parlor rang just as she started upstairs . Sheltered and shy for her seventeen years , unused to sudden dilemmas ( or so the family legend goes ) , my mother hesitated . The tray , heavy with bone china , trembled between her thin wrists . Before she could decide whether to continue up or sacrifice the eggs to the chilling breath of the air-cooler , the ringing stopped . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment later the receiver clicked back into its cradle and Lyman Mays loomed up at the head of the stairs . <p> My grandfather was a big man , not only in height but in construction . Over the past ten years his broad chest had receded as a paunch had advanced , but the flesh had become neither flaccid nor weak . His carriage was still erect , his jaw strong , his reddish-brown brows thick and wild . His silvering hair , pomaded back from the high forehead , reinforced the unmistakable impression of stern dignity , even when he was clad only in his striped crinkle-crepe pajamas , as he was that morning . Padding down the stairs to his private den he ignored his daughter 's urgent apologies , his mouth cinched into a pensive frown , his eyes cloudy with worry . He took a gray-and-green ceramic mallard from the mantelpiece , unscrewed its head and poured a shot of whiskey into a coffee mug . Then he squeezed behind his large oak desk and sighed deeply . <p> The police said the boy , star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drunk . Stumbling home from a party , he had gone to bed on the tracks of the Classen Boulevard streetcar line , his head pillowed between the wooden ties . It had been after midnight , there was no moon , and the redbud trees that lined the avenue threw deceptive shadows onto the gravel median . Not until the trolley had dragged the boy several yards , one leg bouncing to the side like the tail of a mouse caught in a cat 's mouth , did the conductor realize something was wrong . <p> " Poor fellow , " Lyman Mays murmured , thinking of the dead shortstop 's father . He remembered the death of his own precious wife many years before and felt in his chest the sharp pain of empathy . " Bring me the phone from the other room , darling , " he told his daughter , who waited nervously against one of the dark paneled walls . " There is much to be done . " <p> For even at his most grief-striker , my grandfather was not a man given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long line of hardy pioneers who , despite the best efforts of nature , the federal government and the thieving Indian Nations , had hewed out their fortunes from the inhospitable rock-red plains of Central Oklahoma  --  men who did not cash their chips with two strikes , two out , and the future in scoring position . <p> " Oh my God , " sobbed Melvin , horrified by news of the tragedy . <p> " ' Whatsoever God doeth , it shall be forever , " ' Lyman Mays told his assistant sales manager and first-base coach , " ' nothing can be put to it , nothing taken away . ' Ecclesiastes . It is we , Melvin , the living , who must persevere and forge onward . " <p> " Oh my God , Mr. Mays , " he sobbed . <p> But Melvin had been hired for his efficiency and in that time of need , steadied by the commanding voice of Lyman Mays , he did not fail . By noon , with barely six hours remaining until game time , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy who had led the McGrath Meat Packing Sox in batting the previous two seasons . <p> " He might not want to play for us , Mr. Mays , " Melvin warned , " and they 're not going to want to let him go . " <p> " ' And He said unto them , " ' Lyman Mays answered , smiling , " ' Why are ye so fearful ? How is it that ye have no faith ? ' Mark . " <p> Lyman Mays changed into his best tropical worsted suit , which he wore whenever negotiating an important transaction . From the window he watched Katie . Stooped beneath the clothesline and whacking an Oriental rug with the banjo-shaped wire beater , she looked lovely in the brilliant June sun  --  blond hair wispy against her long neck , a sheen of sweat on her upper lip , motes of carpet dust netted in her pale eyelashes . <p> " A girl a mile less prettier than you , sweetheart , " Lyman Mays said as he helped her over the running board of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " could n't help but turn the eye of our young shortstop friend . " <p> That day the hot prairie winds swarmed up from the south , so they smelled the yards long before they saw them , a stew of stenches that became more distinct the closer they came to its source  --  pits of rotting offals , manure seething with trough flies and boiling down to liquid in the heat , tall chimneys coughing out oily clouds of burnt bone meal and tallow . Just when the stink had become almost unbearable , the car crested a lump of a hill and they looked out on acres and acres of holding pens , so teeming with cattle that the entire landscape , from hillside to horizon , seemed cobbled with the wide brown and black backs of Panhandle Shorthorn and Head Angus . <p> Lyman Mays rolled the LaSalle down into the sprawling snarl of wooden lairages and shifted to a stop next to a long concrete building with a corrugated iron roof , on the side of which sun-faded letters spelled out " McGrath . " Inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhythmic cracking of cleaver blades , hundreds of steer carcasses clicked along on overhead track hangers , stripped , as they progressed from skinning cradle to skinning cradle , of head , hide , innards and spine . A sticky residue of blood and sweat settled on Katie 's bare face and arms ; she tasted on her lips something that , sweet and sickening , reminded her of pineapple juice . She closed her eyes and clutched her father 's arm . Lyman Mays pressed a freshly laundered handkerchief , scented with a drop of Old Spice , to his mouth . <p> " Could you be able to tell me , sir , " he asked a man carving a tongue from a steer 's head , " where I might find a gentleman by the name of William Eagle ? " <p> The man wiped his knife on his long leather apron and pointed . " That 'd be the little Indian , " he said , " stickin ' down there in number four . " <p> So it was in the killing pens that Lyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine-hundred-pound heifer . The boy was not the dark , tall , muscular Osage brave Lyman Mays had expected ; rather , he was pale , short for his nineteen years  --  barely an inch over five feet  --  and slightly built . High , sharp cheekbones and black eyes , coiled deep and dark in the hollows beneath his brow , were the legacy of his lone Creek ancestor , a great-grandfather on his father 's side , but his light-brown hair and his size came from his mother 's people , who were French . <p> Full-blooded or not , Bill Eagle made quick work of the heifer . He had it shackled to the hoist only a moment after its heavy body dropped beneath the blow from his partner 's sledgehammer . The muscles of his bare back straining , he cranked the tackle until the animal 's chin swayed a few inches above the sloping concrete floor and then , smoothing the hide and pulling against the cutting stroke with his left hand , he sliced open its neck from dewlap to sternum . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip of his knife found the main throat arteries and split them in half . A powerful , hiccupping stream of blood pooled greasy and rainbow-flecked around the toes of his rubber boots . He pumped the heifer 's foreleg to speed the flow down an iron grill and then shoved the carcass along the overhead rail into the main hall , where a man stood ready to chalk the ripping lines . <p> Impressed by the strength and agility of a boy so small , but unwilling to concede any bargaining advantages , Lyman Mays stepped decorously around a galvanized steel bucket crusted with some foul-looking substance . He held out his hand . " Good afternoon , son , " he said , in the reasonable but stern tones he reserved for the poor and desperate people who came to him peddling their broken-down old Model A 's . " I wonder if I might have a word with you ? " <p> Suspicion in his dark eyes , Bill Eagle ran a nervous thumb along the spine of his eight-inch blade and looked up at the imposing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled a rough canvas shirt , stitched from one-hundred-pound unbleached sugar sacks , over his head . " Yes , sir . " <p> " I have a proposition for you , son , " Lyman Mays said . <p> It was at that moment Katie Mays fainted . The heat , the fumes , the sight of death , squeezed her lungs tight and freckled her vision with brightly colored spots . Standing in the corner behind her father , silent and attentive , she managed to take a step toward the narrow wooden cattle race  --  where the air was somewhat fresher  --  before she shuddered and pitched forward . <p> Bill Eagle , unable to match Lyman Mays 's grave scrutiny , saw her fall . After only a moment of surprised hesitation he sprang forward and slid on his knees across the smooth floor , catching Katie in his arms . He held her , her head cradled in the crook of his lap , and was fascinated by the foreign scent of lilac and honeysuckle and soap , by the tiny golden whiskers that grew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful throat that pulsed with a single blue vein . When he brushed a strand of hair from her face , feeling the warm skin of her forehead , her eyes fluttered open . <p> " You are beautiful , " Bill Eagle said with wonder . <p> Those few seconds were all it took for Lyman Mays to secure a new shortstop for his Used Auto Cardinals , thrice-consecutive state champions in the 19-and-under division and destined to repeat yet again , if his eye for great ballplayers was as keen as he knew it was . Even in the urgent bustle of carrying Katie to the car and sending the boozy old knocker running for cold water , Lyman Mays marveled at the speed , the fluidity of movement , in the boy 's diving save  --  as if Bill Eagle lived in a medium of air , those around him in water . <p> All the necessary arrangements went off without a hitch . Griffin McGrath , in the market for a new Ford Tudor , was easily persuaded to loan the boy out for the summer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , move out of his cramped , filthy room in the boarding house and into the mansion on 16th Street . This way Bill could quit the packing house and concentrate on his game , explained Lyman Mays , anxious , given the boy 's shiftless Indian nature , to keep an eye on his new star athlete . Only a few hours after Katie fainted in the sweltering stench of the killing pen , Bill Eagle was installed in one of the spare bedrooms on the third floor , his little bundle of belongings  --  glove , comb , Sunday shoes , and sticking knife  --  deposited in an antique armoire made of polished mahogany . <p> " It came to pass , " ' Lyman Mays said that first night at supper , following an opening-day victory in which Bill Eagle doubled twice , " ' Laban ran to meet Jacob and he embraced him and he brought him to his house . And Laban said to him , Surely thou art my bone and my flesh . ' Genesis . " <p> Katie glanced across the table at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy always said he wanted a son . " <p> And like a son Bill Eagle was treated . Together , as a family , the three of them took their meals , attended church ( Lyman Mays had Melvin buy Bill a new white cotton shirt ) and rocked away the long evenings of summer , sipping iced lemonade on the front porch and listening to the big six-tube Victor  --  the Kraft Music Hall , ball games from St. Louis , Fulton Lewis Jr . and his Top of the News . At first tense and guarded in the calm elegance of his surroundings , Bill began to adjust to his new life . His offer to earn his keep by running errands or washing the lot-cars refused ( " Rest and grow strong , son , " Lyman Mays said , " keep your eye on the ball " ) , his days were peaceful and easy . Soon his sticking knife , tied up in a piece of newspaper , lay forgotten . <p> Mornings he helped Katie with the household chores  --  weeding the garden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polishing with a rag-wrapped brick the mansion 's endless parquet floors  --  but the remainder of the day , before and after the game , they were free to do whatever they wanted . Never before had Bill Eagle been able to afford such a diversity of amusements ( Lyman Mays provided him with a cash allowance ) . They saw matinees downtown at the Bijou and the Criterion , swam at Sandy Lake Beaches and , on Friday and Saturday nights , took the trolley north to the Belle Isle Amusement Park , where they spun across the pine-plank dance floor to the music of the Lloyd Patterson Orchestra . It was on one Saturday night , early in August , when they walked over to the secluded leeward side of the island , from where the canoe boat rides were launched during the day , and kissed under a vast black Oklahoma sky notched with stars . <p> Katie cherished the life that had , without warning , become hers . For the first time since her mother died , she knew the love and attention of a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bright , colorful world . She suspected her father 's motives , of course , but that did n't matter . When she was with Bill she no longer seemed a part of the big , empty , hollow , suffocating house ; she felt lighter than air , liberated , hopeful . <p> " When I 'm with you I have n't ever been happier , " she said , with sincerity . She was not sure , exactly , if she was in love with this boy , but she knew she loved how she felt when she was with him . <p> " I like it here , " Bill answered , his heart as joyful as the wild south winds that chased across the plains . <p> For Lyman Mays , too , it was a glorious summer . After a decade of sluggish sales down at the car lot , business was finally beginning to pick up . The Cardinals , behind the league-leading hitting of their new shortstop , were once again the scourge of the Oklahoma County American Legion , winning eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When , in August , the First Methodist of Classen Boulevard , where Lyman Mays served as a lay preacher , was chosen by church headquarters in Dallas to host the annual Bible Prayer Conference , Lyman Mays bowed his head and gave thanks to God . <p> " ' And the Lord hath given him twice as much as he had before , " ' he quoted at the dinner table that night , in a voice shaken with emotion . " Job . " <p> With a certain unease , though , Lyman Mays observed the young romance that blossomed on his metal porch glider . He had no quarrel with the boy , who , despite his background , was clean , polite and quiet ; but Bill Eagle was , simply , from the wrong side of the Santa Fe line , the wrong side of the middle-class neighborhoods honest businessmen were sculpting from the Depression 's rubbled wake . But Lyman Mays was a patient man and a prudent one , as he told his friends , and so he waited until the morning after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eighth inning when Bill Eagle tripled and then scored on a passed ball , before he invited Bill into his den for a glass of lemonade . <p> " Son , " he said , sitting on the edge of his desk , " Mr. McGrath informs me he may run short of hands this autumn . So as much as I hate to do it , I 'll have to return your services . I 'm a man of my word , Bill . " <p> Bill , sunk down in a leather armchair almost twice his size , studied the oil portraits of short-haired pointers that lined the walls . " You mean to say , " he said slowly , " I wo n't be living with you until next summer ? " <p> " Well , Bill . " Lyman Mays shook his head and smiled , his thick red brows arching with sympathy . " You turn twenty in January and there 's just no way around the age rule . I 've called every official in the league . " He pressed the palms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to know that everything is arranged  --  your old room at Mrs. Wasper 's , your old shift at the packing house . Mr. McGrath will automatically deduct the money you owe me for summer room and board , so you wo n't have to worry your head about all those figures . And Bill , I hope you 'll be able to pay us a visit some time after you get settled . " <p> And that was that . With seven long miles  --  crossed by no streetcar line  --  between Colored Town and Mays House , with Katie tucked away in high school from eight o'clock until four every day , with Bill Eagle back on the twelve-hour killing shifts six days a week , Lyman Mays knew the little case of puppy love would inevitably wither and die . <p> But Bill gauged differently the caliber of his love for Katie . He pawned a gold-veined locket that had been his mother 's and bought a secondhand bicycle . Black frame warped from age and rust , it drifted to the left when ridden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bike back in the proper direction every fifty feet or so  --  but it was faster than walking . Each weekday at six o'clock , when the quitting whistles at the stockyards barked , Bill carefully washed the blood and death from his face and pedaled the seven miles north . <p> Rarely speaking , as if frivolous conversation wasted their precious time together , he and Katie sat on the front porch , held hands , and listened to Bing Crosby on Maxwell House Coffee Time . When that program ended Katie was required to go back inside and do homework . Bill began the long , dark ride back the boarding house . <p> Lyman Mays waited , betting that Bill Eagle 's cycling adventures would end with the first cold , wet rains of September . Autumn , though , remained unseasonably mild and sunny , and Lyman became more and more irritable as the days passed . He slept fitfully at night , lying awake in the dark and straining for some echo of an approaching storm . He spent hours alone in his den , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue sky , stroking his nose with the tips of his fingers . <p> Finally , on the first day of October , a chilly squall whipped across the lake . Lyman Mays 's hopes were lifted to the heavens . But then he heard , through the clamor of shutters smacking in the gale , the familiar creaking and squeaking of Bill Eagle 's bicycle , and he thought he would be driven out of his mind with exasperation . <p> " When a young man shows such attentions to a young lady of marriageable age , " Lyman Mays told the boy , whom he invited into the den that night for another discussion , " it is the responsibility of that young lady 's father to discern the young man 's intentions . " Lyman Mays slowly repeated these last words , hoping to emphasize the frightening implications of imminent , legally binding commitment . " The young man 's intentions . " <p> Bill Eagle sat and thought for a moment , his face guileless and earnest . Then his eyes brightened with comprehension . He nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " I plan on marrying your daughter . " <p> Startled , Lyman Mays glared at the soaked , bedraggled Indian boy who sat shivering before him . When he ascertained at last that Bill Eagle had spoken in all seriousness , a grim smile of amusement came to his lips . <p> " You see , son , " he explained , " Katie has been doing just too much socializing and not enough studying . " <p> Banned then from Katie 's presence , Bill Eagle nevertheless continued to make the daily journey northward , by wheel and then , when the old bike crumbled , by foot . The October nights came quicker and colder , but still Bill pressed on , head bent against the Canadian winds , leather apron wound around his hands as partial protection against the insidious chill . Every day he delivered Katie a note , a few words carefully scratched onto a scrap of brown packing paper . Often he lingered to gaze up at her cheerful yellow bedroom window . <p> Katie , who waited for him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment she saw him stamp his numbed feet and turn toward home . She held the day 's letter to her breast and watched him disappear into the darkness , pretending that she could feel his warm , gentle presence in the recently vacated space next to the mailbox . <p> Glowering in the dusky solitude of his den , Lyman Mays watched Bill Eagle continue to materialize , without fail , on the front lawn every evening . Although the boy no longer entered the house or even saw Katie , his effect on her was undiminished . In the past such a beautifully meek and restrained creature , she had taken to occasional smiling , blushing and humming ever since Bill Eagle had invaded their lives . One night , late in October , Lyman Mays sat up in bed , logged with sweat and shaken by the terror of a midnight revelation  --  that Katie 's high spirits might be the result of a plot , planted in the fertile soil of her naive . impressionable mind , to elope . The next evening he intercepted Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mays had lost several pounds in the past two months  --  the collar of his shirt , normally tight against his stout neck , hung loose a fraction of an inch , marring his usually impeccable appearance  --  but an even greater change had come over Bill Eagle . Thin to start with , the long treks to Mays House , coupled with the brutal labor of the stockyards , had sheared his frame of all excess flesh . The sharp knobs of his collarbone protruded alarmingly and the ridges of his cheekbones had grown even more pronounced . His pale , coarse-grained skin , never swarthy , now had the white , luminescent glow of a boiled soup bone . Despite all this , though , despite the tiny crimson and yellow spurs that muddied his eyes with fatigue , his expression was peaceful , content . <p> " I plan on marrying your daughter , " he said . <p> " These are hard times , son , " Lyman Mays answered , clenching his anger in his fists and attempting one last time to drive a stake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate to confess this , were you and Kate to marry , I would be unable to offer you any monetary assistance at all . " He waited for Bill Eagle to absorb the significance of his words . " What I 'm saying , son , is you are on your own if you take my daughter away ; neither you nor she will receive one penny from me . " <p> When Bill Eagle nodded , quickly , without surprise or concern , Lyman Mays smoothed onto the desktop the title to a 1939 Packard and anchored it there with a set of keys . " If you promise me , if you give me your word as a man that you 'll stay forever away from my daughter , this car is yours . " <p> " No , sir , " Bill Eagle said . He rose , unsteady from the thick heat and baked Old Spice aroma of the den . " I plan on marrying your daughter . " <p> The snows came in November but still Bill Eagle paid his nightly visits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just the bitter cold with which to contend . Lyman Mays gave Katie a dog for her eighteenth birthday , and that big black rottweiler patrolled the grounds from sundown till sunup . Bill Eagle tried to sneak past it the first time , holding to the cover of the holly bushes , but even with the moon hidden by clouds and the sleet blinding , the dog sensed him . Dead leaves crackled on the porch and Bill turned to see the beast emerge from the shadows , blunt ears cocked back on its triangular head like twin rifle bolts . <p> Bill paused and the dog leapt , snarling , from the porch . Its hot , slashing jaws caught the meat of his calf and sent him tumbling into a snow bank . With one hand he tried to beat away the animal , while with the other he dragged himself over the yard 's fence . He lay exhausted on his back for more than an hour , the blood from his torn leg fading into the snow , the dog 's bared fangs gouging at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Eagle went directly back to the boarding house when his shift at the slaughterhall ended . All night he sat alone in the tiny room , thinking , sharpening his knife on a chunk of flat sandstone . His head ached with loathing for Lyman Mays . On the fourth day , lagging behind in the noisy confusion of quitting time , he speared with his knife one of the long , greasy beef tongues that lay drying on a wire-mesh rack . He carried it to Mays House , where he flung it onto the porch with his strong shortstop 's arm . Without waiting , he turned for home . <p> At the end of seven nights and seven tongues , he was able to cross the yard unmolested . The rottweiler attempted an attack but managed only a few half-hearted steps before it retched up a slime of rich , rotten meat and slunk back to the porch . That evening Bill stood beneath Katie 's window for an entire , wonderful hour , watching for her shadow against the shade . Just as he was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the sash to peer out into the darkness . Softly clapping his raw hands together , he caught her attention . <p> " Oh , Bill , I 've missed you so , " she cried , opening the window and leaning over the sill . " And now you 're here again . " <p> Bill looked up at the small , pretty face , her cheeks already rosy from the icy air . " I 'll always be here , Katie . " <p> " I thought you 'd gone away , " she said , " because of that terrible dog . " <p> " I 'll never go away , Katie , " he whispered . <p> Lyman Mays 's joy had bloomed fresh each successive night Bill Eagle had remained absent from his property , so the discovery that the path to his daughter had been laid open  --  his watchdog poisoned somehow  --  was especially bitter . A quiet rage built in his heart as he stood at his den window . He gripped the edge of his desk , watching the boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , reason and locomotion returned to him , he bolted the door , took the ceramic mallard down from the shelf and turned to the Word of God . <p> The next evening Lyman Mays did not have to ask and Bill Eagle did not have to reply . Silently the one led , obediently the other followed . Bill took his familiar place in the leather armchair . Lyman Mays prodded the fire with an iron poker until it sneezed a shower of sparks . He lifted a King James Bible from the desk and fingered its gold-engraved cover . <p> " And David hath said , " Lyman Mays intoned , his voice even graver than usual , " ' Do you think that marrying the king 's daughter is a matter of so little consequence that a poor man , like myself , can do it ? They reported what he said , and Saul replied , Tell David this : all the king wants as the bride-price are the foreskins of one hundred Philistines . " ' He turned to face Bill Eagle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bill Eagle said , examining the tops of his tattered shoes . " I plan on marrying your daughter . " <p> " For God 's sake , son . " Lyman Mays brought the head of the poker down hard on the brick hearth . " Have n't you understood a word I 've said ? " Bill cleared his throat but was motioned to silence . " Saul loved that little shepherd boy named David , he wanted him to marry his daughter . But Saul knew that David had a man 's pride . He knew that David would n't take the hand of his daughter unless he had earned it . Do you understand that ? Saul gave him the chance , son , a chance I 'm giving you right now . " <p> " Yes , sir ? " Bill stared back down at his feet . Outside the wind cackled through the treetops ; the eaves of the big house creaked . <p> " You young folks may scoff at these sorts of traditions , Bill , " Lyman Mays said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , God-fearing father happy . Let us say that you will bring me one hundred one-dollar bills by sunset Sunday , one week from today . One hundred foreskins and then you and Kate can be married , with my full blessings . " <p> Bill Eagle looked up . " Mr. Mays , hundred dollars is a lot of money . " <p> The intoxicating sap of triumph rising in his veins , Lyman Mays fixed Bill with a look of contempt . " Son , " he said , " my daughter is worth many , many times more than one hundred dollars . If you 're not willing to provide that much for her , perhaps you should think about what kind of husband you 'd make . " He moved his face close and whispered , " Perhaps you should think about what kind of man you are . " <p> " I plan on marrying your daughter , " Bill Eagle said , but Lyman Mays just roared with laughter . He had checked with McGrath to be certain : even the best stickers handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickel a head . Supposing Bill Eagle had a few possessions to pawn , a few dollars stuffed in a sock beneath his cot  --  it would take him more than a full month of hard work to get the cash . Banks did not loan that sort of money to Indians . If Bill Eagle resorted to criminal means he undoubtedly would be arrested or shot dead through the heart , either of which result would serve Lyman Mays 's purposes . <p> " Sunset , " Lyman Mays called across the yard , confident that Bill Eagle would never again set foot on it . " One hundred foreskins in one week . " <p> But just as David had been much wiser and more stubborn than wily old Saul had imagined , so was Bill Eagle given to neither rashness nor retreat . He made no foolhardy attempt to rob a bank ; nor did he surrender and flee . In the morning he reported for work at the slaughterhall , where he calmly asked the foreman to assign him two killing stalls instead of the usual one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreman asked , " you needing a little extra jack ? " <p> " One hundred dollars , " Bill Eagle said . <p> The foreman , alerted by the boy 's sullen , dangerous eyes , swallowed a laugh . He pointed silently to a pair of pens at the end of the hall . " Be needing six stalls for that , " he muttered when the boy had gone . <p> From sunup until midnight Bill Eagle hacked away at the torrent of cattle that swept over him . His muscles knotted with a furious pain that went unrelieved by a few hours of sleep on the hard floor of the boiler room . In his dreams he continued to kill , steer after steer , waking even more exhausted than before . When , on the third day , the vessels in his eyes burst from fatigue and blocked his vision with a sticky red mucous , he used his fingertips to find the throat arteries of the steers . <p> " Jesus God , " the foreman said on the fourth day , after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Eagle had stuck and bled . " Ai n't no way in hell he can keep this up . " <p> On the fifth day , numbed by the constant pressure of lifting , heaving and cranking , Bill Eagle 's fingers began to bend and snap against the heavy carcasses . No longer able to close his broken fist , he knotted his knife to his palm with a strip of cloth . Still he kept on , the tip of his knife never puncturing the rib-side of the artery or allowing blood to run back into the cage . <p> As word of the miraculous events spread , men from every corner of the slaughterhall gathered to watch . By the seventh day , the crowd around the killing pens was so thick that it took the foreman a number of pokes with a butt hammer to force his way to the front . " Say he 's killed a thousand just this week , " a legging man said , pulling at his chin thoughtfully . " Say he 's got the demon in him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powered Bill Eagle those last hours , his eyes swollen shut and his nose streaming blood , nor was it his love for Katie Mays . What occupied his mind and his heart solely and completely as the hour of deadline approached  --  leaving no room for pain or delirium  --  was the hateful vision of Lyman Mays 's face . <p> At that exact moment Lyman Mays stood by the fireplace in his den , warming his hands and savoring imminent victory . But just as the crimson winter sun began to settle on the horizon 's black , bristling treetops , Katie appeared in the doorway , startling him from his exhilarating meditations . <p> " Why are n't you attending to your guests ? " he asked , frowning . " You will , I hope and expect , make your gentlemen callers feel welcome . " <p> " Daddy , " Katie said , neither retreating nor glancing away , " I do n't want those boys to come courting . I want to know where Bill is .

As it is my parental obligation , I brought up the question of his intentions toward you . " Pulling a reluctant Katie into his arms , he rocked her stiffly back and forth . " Katie , dear heart , " he cooed , " a man who is n't willing to join himself to you in holy wedlock is n't a man who deserves your tears .

" He 'll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minutes before the afternoon 's last light slipped down the steps of the porch , moments after Lyman Mays finished serving mugs of hot chocolate to the two burly young car salesmen he had invited over for Sunday supper , the doorbell chimed . <p> " I 'm here for Katie , " Bill Eagle said . He clutched the doorjamb for support , a crust of dark dried blood reaching from the top of his forehead to his bare , bruised-yellow chest . In the fingers of his crippled right hand he held a thick wedge of bills . " I got you your one hundred foreskins . " <p> A full minute Lyman Mays stared at the battered and pathetic apparition . Then he smiled at Bill Eagle . " Son , " he said , " I would n't sell my daughter to a stinking half-breed for a thousand , a million dollars . Now get the hell off my property . " <p> " No , " Bill Eagle said . But his resolve , his hate for Lyman Mays , had finally broken apart . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past week , rushed back over him in a bitter wash of despair . For a moment neither he nor Lyman Mays moved , just as sticker and steer remain motionless in the long , eerie moment between hammer stroke and collapse . Then Lyman Mays nodded to his two men , on hand for just such a situation . They hurried forward and pinioned a sagging Bill Eagle between them . <p> " Be certain this young gentleman is aware , " Lyman Mays said , " that if he ever so much as lays an eye upon my daughter , I will have him put behind bars for the rest of his life . " He slammed the door with a flourish . <p> When Lyman Mays turned , though , to retire to the solace of his ceramic mallard , he encountered his daughter , who looked at him with eyes full of fury and rancor . He took a hesitant step toward her , his arms outstretched , but she lashed out at him , striking the bridge of his nose with such force that a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right hand , he clubbed her a blow that shook a thread of blood and saliva from her mouth . <p> She sank to the floor without a sound . Worried , repentant , Lyman Mays carried her gently up the stairs . He placed her in the canopied , four-poster bed , tucked the cotton-wool blanket up to her chin and kissed her on the cheek . " I am so sorry , honey doll , " he whispered . Then he switched off the light , making sure to lock the bedroom door behind him . <p> That night , for the first time in months , Lyman Mays slept soundly . He dreamed not of the mess that had plagued him since August , but of an endless string of affluent car buyers . " How 're you ? " he asked , hopping with delight from customer to customer . " What can I interest you in today ? " He was awakened by the clear glow of dawn slatting through the big oak tree outside his window , and by a soft but persistent tapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mays asked , fuzzy with the residue of pleasant dreams , puzzled by the bloodshot black eyes glaring down at him . " What can I interest you in today ? " <p> Bill Eagle held up the index finger with which he had tapped Lyman Mays awake . " Just one foreskin , " he said . <p> Enlightenment came quickly to Lyman Mays then , flooding the landscape of his mind like a fast-breaking sunrise . Then , before he had a chance to wonder why the boy , crouched atop him , was contorted into such an odd position  --  torso twisted , right arm hidden behind his back as if he were trying to scratch a hard-to-reach place in the hollow at the base of his spine  --  Lyman Mays felt a tiny pinprick of cool metal through his crinkle-crepe fabric of his pajama pants , at the busy intersection of trunk and legs . <p> The wedding was set for the Sunday following . Katie brought down from the attic the dress in which her mother had been married  --  a floor-length gown of white marquisette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round neckline and a full skirt trimmed with ruffles of Chantilly lace . Lyman Mays , gracious in defeat , had the parlor of Mays House festooned with wicker baskets of poinsettias , hired a pianist to play traditional selections , and even presented Bill Eagle with a hand-engraved 14-karat solid gold ring , set with seven sparkling diamonds , to give to Katie . <p> The day of the ceremony , however , the groom could not be found . Lyman Mays grieved publicly for his daughter 's broken heart and confided privately to friends that , given the boy 's heritage , he was not surprised Bill Eagle had run off . Most sensible people in town knew what was what , though , particularly when the newspaper reported that a body , beaten and bloated past recognition , had washed ashore at Belle Isle Lake . Still , Katie , who discovered over the Christmas holidays that she was carrying a child , never wavered from the unshakable belief that Bill was alive , that he would eventually return for her . <p> Not long after the aborted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a piece of brown packing paper in his mailbox . Scrawled in a crude hand were these words : <p> " ' And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre . ' Luke . " <p> Almost certain that his daughter was responsible for the note , Lyman Mays nevertheless had the big oak tree outside his bedroom window chopped down and bought a pistol to place on his nightstand . And never again , for the rest of his long life , could he bring himself to sleep on his back . <p> <p> By Louis Berney <p>
