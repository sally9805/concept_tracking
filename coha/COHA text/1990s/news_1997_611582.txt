<p> The record suggests that James A. Winstead Sr. had a very unlucky time working for Washington 's city government . He hurt his back twice , stepped on a rusty nail , suffered an electrical shock and slipped on a patch of ice in a parking lot . <p> In five years , Winstead filed five disability claims . <p> The city 's disability program paid his compensation , medical benefits or both on three of the claims . At the same time , Winstead also was collecting checks as a result of a disability claim he had filed several years earlier with the federal government . <p> Federal authorities successfully prosecuted Winstead for fraud in connection with the double dipping , but the District did not . <p> " If both agencies had the same facts , why did one go one way and the District , with the same set of facts , do nothing ? " asked Roderick Pope , then an investigator for the District 's disability claims program . " Because . . . it has never had a policy of pursuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud . It provides a breeding ground and a favorable atmosphere for corruption and outright illegal activities . " <p> Since 1990 , the District government has spent more than $ 170 million  --  about $ 25 million a year  --  paying the salaries and long-term medical expenses of nonuniformed employees who filed disability claims . The city , which has 32,274 employees , has 12,000 open disability cases , some involving former employees . There are 1,000 workers receiving disability compensation , not including medical costs , that averages $ 19,000 a year . And that compensation , a minimum of about two-thirds of regular salary , is tax free . <p> A portrait of the disability compensation program  --  drawn from interviews with more than 20 current and former city officials , as well as a review of disability records  --  reveals a system beset by understaffing , lack of technology , lenient laws and financial mismanagement . <p> It is a system in which people long past retirement age are entitled to perpetual disability checks ; one investigator is responsible for reviewing 12,000 disability cases ; people whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; little or no effort has been made to recover millions of dollars in overpayments ; and workers claiming injuries can take off weeks at a time without formal scrutiny of their claims . <p> People seldom come face to face with a claims examiner  --  claims can be submitted by telephone  --  and flout the law with confidence because it contains no specific guidelines for prosecuting those who defraud the system . The caseworkers each handle more than 1,000 claims , work with paper files rather than computerized records and deal with department supervisors who have little incentive to get their employees back to work . <p> " I 'm sure there is some fraud , because with every disability program there is some , " said F. Alexis Roberson , the acting director of the District 's Department of Employment Services , which administers the program . " I do n't think there 's a lot of fraud . You ca n't cut back on disabled workers . " <p> To the contrary , the city has set up a system that takes good care of those employees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their salaries tax free , but , if they have dependents , the amount can increase to nearly three-fourths . They retain their health benefits , collect college costs for children as old as 23 and are eligible to have their funeral expenses paid . When city employees get raises , so do those on the disability rolls . <p> By contrast , the maximum disability payment in neighboring Virginia and Maryland is two-thirds of salary , and both states limit the number of years someone can receive benefits . <p> Only recently , in the face of the District 's financial crisis , have city officials began to reexamine the disability program 's costs and cut its budget . Roberson said she wants to bring in a private company to evaluate claims and help return employees to work more swiftly . <p> Few city workers are more experienced with the disability system than Winstead , a computer aide at Ballou High School who was prosecuted by the federal government . A month before his federal conviction , he filed a disability claim with the D.C. government . It was January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives a District disability check for $ 532 every two weeks . <p> Milking the System <p> Workers ' compensation came into being in the early 1900s to benefit employers , not employees . Labor historians say it was conceived as a relatively inexpensive way to avoid lawsuits . The injured worker received medical expenses and a partial salary and , in return , agreed not to sue . <p> Almost from the outset , disability claims have invited controversy : Is the injury genuine ? Is it serious ? And did it really happen on the job ? <p> When the rulings are liberal and enforcement lax , " then nature takes its course , " said Robert S. Smith , a professor of economics at Cornell University . <p> Although it is virtually impossible to quantify fraudulent claims , Smith said , studies have shown that when disability benefits increase , workers tend to stay off the job longer . And programs that offer generous benefits frequently have the highest number of claims per capita , he said . <p> " Some of it may be fraudulent , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting benefits is high enough and the benefits are generous enough that it is worth their while to apply for the program . " <p> A major obstacle to prosecuting disability compensation fraud is the " lack of proof of intent to defraud , " according to a handbook of the National Insurance Crime Bureau , an insurance industry consultant . <p> A senior official in the District 's Department of Employment Services , who asked not to be identified , said that the city 's program is so " worker oriented " that it tempts employees who start out with legitimate claims to " begin to milk the system , " he said . <p> The temptation is increased by vague wording in the District disability law that makes fraud prosecution difficult . The law is patterned after the federal statute , said Muhammad Sheikh , special assistant for the disability program , but the District chooses not to include the federal provisions for prosecuting fraud . <p> If the District law were tougher , it " would cut the program 's spending in half , " Sheikh said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disability program became an issue after a lunch-time slip on a ketchup spill . <p> As a result of the unfortunate tumble , a city employee received a disability pension that would have paid him $ 24,500 a year , tax free , for life . After the story appeared in Philadelphia newspapers , embarrassed city officials took a closer look . <p> The claim was granted , then revoked twice , then appealed in court . Eventually , the case led to an overhaul of the disability program . <p> Jane Lewis , Philadelphia 's deputy city solicitor for risk management , said restructuring the program was one of Mayor Edward G. Rendell 's priorities after his 1993 election . <p> Since then , disability has been privatized . The program has reduced the amount of benefits to claimants , including tax-free pay , and improved its managed-care system . Claimants can choose to seek care from private physicians , but the city offers a financial incentive for them to remain with the contracted doctors . <p> The coordination among workers , nurses , claims adjusters and doctors has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " I would not say it 's a system geared toward returning people to work only , " she said . " The focus is to provide the best medical care available for the injury . A byproduct is that people come back to work more quickly . " <p> The number of workers receiving benefits in Philadelphia , a city of 1.6 million people , is comparable to the District , a city one-third that size , yet the District pays out much more . <p> In Philadelphia , 943 claimants have received $ 8 million annually in each of the last two years . The District spent more than twice that amount  --  about $ 19 million a year since 1995  --  to pay 887 claimants . <p> In Philadelphia , medical expenses were about $ 3 million in 1995 and $ 5 million in 1996 . In Washington , medical expenses were $ 7 million in 1995 and $ 5 million last year . <p> Better Than Retirement <p> When Virginia Norwood began getting disability checks from the District of Columbia 61 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Pearl Harbor was five years away . She was 21 and had contracted a lung condition while training to become a nurse at a city hospital . <p> Norwood , 82 , never completed her training and has n't worked since . Since there is no limit on how long an employee can receive disability payments , she can not be forced to " retire . " <p> There are more than 175 people on the disability payroll who are older than 62 , the earliest age at which city workers can apply for retirement benefits . Twenty disability recipients are more than 80 years old . Some elderly disability recipients also are eligible for Social Security . <p> At retirement age , disability claimants have a choice : They can continue to get tax-free disability compensation or they can elect to get retirement benefits , which amount to less and are taxable . <p> After more than six decades on disability , city officials estimate that Norwood has received at least two dozen pay increases . <p> Norwood said no one ever suggested switching her $ 420 monthly disability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> The Claims Process <p> In the District , filing a disability claim begins with a simple phone call . Last year , the disability hot line rang 2,900 times as workers called to report injuries and request claim forms . <p> After a supervisor and doctor sign paperwork verifying the injury , a worker is entitled to stay off the job for as many as 21 days at full pay while the city evaluates the claim . <p> If the worker returns to the job before 21 days expire , the case is dropped . <p> Until the law was tightened this year , the " evaluation " window was 45 days , and Roberson called it " the most abused part of the system . " One city worker admitted she had taken advantage of the 45-day " free vacation " 10 times . <p> Under District law , workers may have their injury claims validated by their own doctors rather than doctors selected by the city . Once a disability is certified , the department 's claim examiners are charged with making periodic reviews to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews " generally consist of asking disabled workers to have their doctors fill out another form . Face-to-face contact between the examiner and the worker is rare . <p> D.C. Council member Kevin P. Chavous ( D-Ward 7 ) said that unethical doctors can conspire with dishonest workers to defraud the system and that , as a result , " we 're spending too much money on disability compensation . " <p> Workers on disability are transferred from the department payroll to the disability payroll . Consequently , there is little motivation for department supervisors to push for their return to work . The department can leave the position vacant , pay overtime or hire a temporary worker , all less expensive than paying a full-time employee . <p> " If the agency was paying disability out of their budget . . . then they would say , ' What can we do about this situation ? ' " said Betty Ann Kane , a former D.C. Council member who oversaw the disability program in the late 1980s . " If the agency had to pay . . . disability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Critics suggest the city never has put a high priority on scrutinizing disability claims . <p> It was n't until 1992 , more than 10 years after the city assumed responsibility for the disability program from the federal government , that the first investigator was hired . Roderick Pope was given 12,000 cases to review . Despite commendations for his efforts , he left the job the following year . The city still has one investigator to handle the same number of cases . <p> Overpaid , Uncollected <p> William J. Meissner , a D.C. Corrections officer , filed a disability claim saying that he hurt his knee on the job on Aug. 21 , 1992 . Department records indicated that he was n't at work that day . His boss even refused to certify the claim . <p> Despite that , a disability claims examiner overruled the boss and accepted his claim anyway . Meissner began receiving disability compensation . <p> Although the time and place of the accident had been challenged , Meissner 's injury was not . He had surgery . Doctors predicted a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting , the disability records show . <p> A few months later , according to city records , Pope and a Corrections Department investigator tailed Meissner to a pair of nightclubs in Northwest Washington . They reported seeing him carry two large boxes filled with record albums and a large wooden speaker . They said Meissner bragged to them that he regularly worked as a disc jockey under the nickname " Fast Eddie . " <p> By the time Pope 's investigation led to the cutoff of Meissner 's disability pay , he had been paid nearly $ 10,000 in compensation and medical benefits . He was fired and told to pay back the money , city records show . The city has not collected it . <p> " We did n't go after the money , " said Frances P. Berry , administrator of the disability program since 1995 . " He was no longer working . There are so many cases and so many people that things slip through . We were glad he was off the rolls . The simple little paperwork to go after him for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the failure to recover an overpayment such as the one in Meissner 's case is not uncommon . <p> The disability office wrote off nearly $ 1 million in overpayment claims in 1995 , according to a recent audit by the D.C. inspector general . <p> Falling Through the Cracks <p> Three years before the end of the 20th century , Washington 's disability records are maintained much as they might have been three years before the end of the 19th century . They are kept in green file folders , often in stacks on the disability office floor . <p> " When you 're not automated , things can fall through the cracks , " said Berry . " We 're trying to correct that . We 're trying to get people back to work faster , but we want people appropriately cared for . " <p> Berry said the city intends to turn the disability program records over to a private company that can scan all the cases into computer files . She says additional changes will require claimants to see doctors from a managed-care organization who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The city also plans to lower the maximum weekly amount a claimant can collect and adopt a scale for disability-related medical expenses , rather than continue paying different rates to doctors whose rates may vary for the same medical care . <p> The Insurance Factor <p> According to city records , Gordon R. Davis worked as a volunteer paramedic trainer at a New Hampshire fire station for two years while receiving disability payments from the District . City officials had concluded that a back injury suffered in a car accident made him unfit for duty  --  as a paramedic . <p> After suspending his benefits temporarily while an investigator reviewed his case , the city determined that Davis had broken no rules . <p> In June 1994 , four years after the doctors recommended a light-duty job , Davis returned to work in the D.C. Fire Department 's telecommunications division . At the time , he had received $ 55,000 in medical benefits and payments from the disability program . <p> Disability officials , however , say they are investigating whether he received a $ 30,000 insurance settlement from the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipients should be used to reimburse benefits paid by the District . But it is only within the last year that disability program officials have begun to check whether disability recipients have received outside settlements . In the first four months of the effort , more than $ 200,000 was recovered , according to Sheikh , the special assistant in the disability office . <p> Sheikh said that Davis , who could not be reached for comment , has not responded to an April 7 letter inquiring whether he had won an insurance settlement . The matter now is in the hands of city attorneys , Sheikh said . <p> One Job , Two Checks <p> Edward Lee Gilchrist injured his right knee while trimming trees for the city 's Department of Public Works . <p> For 14 months , he collected 75 percent of his $ 31,037 salary in disability compensation . Those checks kept coming  --  $ 18,900 worth  --  after he returned to work , according to city records . <p> When disability officials confronted him , Gilchrist acknowledged that he was wrong , city records show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he deserved the money . <p> " Anything they sent me I felt that was mine , " Gilchrist said . " Who is it up to to stop the payment of checks ? It 's not up to the employee . . . . It 's up to your supervisor to stop that . " <p> It was n't until November , more than three years after Gilchrist 's admission , that the city started deducting $ 200 from each of his paychecks to recoup the funds . <p> District officials took no legal action against him , and he 's still working for the city .
