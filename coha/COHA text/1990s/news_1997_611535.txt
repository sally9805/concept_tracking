<p> Several of the Democratic National Committee 's largest campaign donors also poured nearly a half-million dollars into at least six state party organizations last year , contributions that were solicited by controversial fund-raiser John Huang , according to state and party records . <p> Totaling at least $ 482,500 , the donations show even broader involvement by a handful of big party contributors in financing last year 's election . The contributions , solicited and channeled to the states by the DNC , also illustrate a more complex fund-raising role played by Huang than previously has been reported . <p> A former DNC vice chairman who worked primarily with the Asian American community , he not only raised $ 3.4 million for the DNC  --  including $ 1 million that has been deemed improper and returned  --  but also asked some of the same donors to channel streams of money to states where Democrats faced tough 1996 election battles . <p> Among the major donations Huang generated were $ 272,500 to five state parties from relatives of Thai businesswoman Pauline Kanchanalak and $ 150,000 to six state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a middleman in various deals involving Arkansas companies and Indonesian 's influential Lippo conglomerate . Sen Jong Hsui , a wealthy Taiwanese American businessman , gave at least $ 60,000 in checks to Democratic parties in Michigan , Ohio and Pennsylvania in October , state records and internal party documents show . <p> Some of the donations , made in $ 20,000 to $ 35,000 increments , were tied to exclusive DNC events put together by Huang and attended by President Clinton . It is not illegal for donors to give large amounts directly to state parties , although contributors are required to be U.S. citizens and to donate only money generated within the United States . <p> Unlike the cash often transferred by the Democratic and Republican national parties to their state affiliates , certain direct contributions  --  including these raised by Huang  --  do not have to be reported to the Federal Election Commission . Instead , the records are maintained in 50 state capitals , making it difficult to get a complete picture of the pattern of giving by major donors . <p> " It represents a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationwide basis , " said Kent Cooper , a former FEC official who directs the Center for Responsive Politics . " That research is necessary to fully understand the extent of large donors earning favors with our national leaders and their political parties . " <p> The contributions by individual donors to the state party organizations , including those raised by Huang , add another element to the tangled campaign-finance affair that has embroiled and embarrassed the Democratic Party since late September . Huang 's activities are under federal investigation . On Tuesday , the DNC set a $ 100,000 contribution limit and said that it would accept future individual donations only from U.S. citizens , even though the law allows giving by resident noncitizens . <p> Party officials defended the practice of accepting donations from contributors channeled to the states by the DNC and said the contributions are fully disclosed in state campaign finance records . A Republican Party official acknowledged that the Republican National Committee also encourages donors to give directly to state parties . <p> Donations solicited by Huang that ended up in Michigan , Ohio , California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a review of records kept by the election commissions in those states . The Washington Post review included party records for eight states . It is unclear whether additional donations by the big DNC donors came in to 42 other state party organizations , whose records were not reviewed . <p> State party officials said the " directed " money from the large DNC donors was used mainly for grass-roots activities such as staffing local campaign offices and get-out-the vote drives . Under the law , it could not be used in individual campaigns for federal office . However , in some states it went into a fund that also paid for some television advertising covering political themes . <p> Pauline Kanchanalak has been a prominent figure in the DNC campaign finance controversy . The DNC returned $ 253,500 in funds solicited since 1993 from Kanchanalak after she told DNC officials in November that the contributions on checks from " P. Kanchanalak " of McLean , Va. , actually came from her mother-in-law , Praitun Kanchanalak . As legal permanent U.S. residents , both Kanchanalak and her mother-in-law are allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of another . <p> In addition to those contributions directly to the DNC , the committee 's internal records contain a notation in July for a combined $ 50,000 in " directed " donations from Pauline Kanchanalak to Illinois and Pennsylvania . State records do not show her making such contributions to state parties there , but do show donations totaling $ 142,500 from " P. Kanchanalak " of McLean , Va. , to state parties in California , Florida , Illinois , Ohio and Pennsylvania . <p> Pauline Kanchanalak 's sister-in-law , Duangnet G. Kronenberg , of that same McLean , Va. , address , sent checks totaling $ 130,000 to the same state parties . Contributions from Kanchanalak family members to the DNC and state parties total more than $ 650,000 since 1992 . <p> Over the last several years , Kanchanalak has pursued business opportunities involving Thai and U.S. companies while cultivating ties to senior Clinton administration officials . Last week , the New York Times reported that she was active last year in trying to get the U.S. Export-Import Bank to back financing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper reported that the unusual deal , which did not materialize , would have benefited a Thai conglomerate , whose subsidiary was seeking the rights to operate the stores . <p> Kanchanalak enlisted Huang 's help in 1994 in getting the Clinton administration to back the U.S.-Thai Business Council , a group that promotes U.S. trade policies favorable to Thailand , at a time when Huang was a senior Commerce official . Records show that she has been to the White House at least 26 times since the start of the Clinton administration , including a June 18 coffee with the president to which she brought five business associates . The DNC showed an $ 85,000 contribution from her at around the same time . <p> Huang also played a role in directing Kronenberg 's contributions to the five states , in addition to $ 70,000 she gave directly to the DNC last year , party records show . <p> On July 30 last year , Hsui , who has business interests in the United States and Taiwan , attended a small dinner with Clinton at the Jefferson Hotel in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Huang , included James Riady of Indonesia 's Lippo Group , for whom Huang was once the top U.S. official , and Eugene Wu , head of a major Taiwanese business group . The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Hsui and Wu have extensive business ties . <p> Hsui contributed $ 150,000 directly to the DNC in early September , and DNC coding indicates the contribution was made in connection with the July dinner . Then in late September , two more more entries in DNC internal logs put Hsui down for another $ 150,000 , again in connection with the Jefferson dinner , and again with Huang listed as fund-raiser . <p> The latter two entries also contain phrases showing how that $ 150,000 was to be divided in state contributions : " donor directed OH ( 20 ) ; PA ( 20 ) " and " donor directed : 30 each to : IL , FL , CA ; 20 to MI , " the log reads . <p> Records obtained from those states show that Hsui did contribute $ 20,000 each on Oct. 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pennsylvania . Available records do not show that he gave $ 30,000 to Illinois , Florida or California . <p> The DNC records also contain an entry for a $ 25,000 Giroir contribution that says " donor directed : IL " and lists Huang as the fund-raiser and the code for the Jefferson Hotel dinner . Giroir , who has had business dealings with Riady 's Lippo conglomerate , did not attend the dinner but did give in connection with the event , according to the DNC . <p> He contributed $ 25,000 to the Illinois Democrats in September and another $ 25,000 apiece  --  for a total of $ 150,000  --  to the state parties in Michigan , Pennsylvania and Ohio in June , and California and Florida in September . Giroir gave another $ 25,000 directly to the DNC last May , before the state contributions , and $ 23,000 to the DNC in 1995 , according to FEC records . <p> A number of other donors have also made contributions to both the DNC and multiple Democratic state parties . On Oct. 16 , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from six contributors , including the Hsui and Kanchanalak checks . <p> Two other contributors on that day gave $ 50,000 each  --  Wall Street trader Paul Tudor Jones II and J. Richard Fredericks , an executive with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco . Each contributed more than $ 100,000 to the DNC directly last year . Jones also gave $ 20,000 to the Democrats in Florida and spent millions of dollars there waging a battle to help pay for Everglades preservation with a sugar tax . Fredericks contributed $ 50,000 each to the Democratic parties in Florida and Illinois . Both men declined to comment on their contributions . <p> Special correspondent Anne Farris contributed to this report .
