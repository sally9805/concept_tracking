The fun is about to begin . After building the tube and altazimuth mount as outlined in part one of this series ( January 1995 ) , it 's time to work on the optics . With just a few more hours work , the scope will be ready to focus the light of faint nebulae and distant galaxies . The final bit of work falls into three parts . The first part , the primary mirror cell , will take the longest , requiring several hours to assemble . It 's the only major construction step remaining , but one of the most important of the project . The second part consists of installing the mirrors , focuser , and finderscope . This is the most precise step of the project . And signaling the debut of the wood , screws , and glass as a working telescope , the final part involves aligning the optics . A BETTER MIRROR CELL A primary mirror cell has several functions . It holds the mirror firmly but without pinching to avoid introducing aberrations , or flaws , into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tube when pointing down . It allows easy alignment of the mirror . To avoid poor images , it should also help the mirror equalize as fast as possible with the air temperature when taken outdoors . The PortaScope uses a wooden mirror cell for ease of construction and good thermal properties . The cell has a three-point support for the mirror . A 10-inch mirror is near the useful limits of a three-point support , especially for the thin mirrors used in Dobsonian scopes . Proper placement of the three supports will maintain this cell 's effectiveness . Telescope makers who demand perfect optical performance may wish to investigate building or buying a nine-point cell , which supports the mirror 's weight more evenly than a three-point cell does . ( See the books listed in Resources in the back of this issue . ) Although some telescope makers advocate supporting the mirror at its edge , a large mirror in such a cell will sag at the center , causing the image to become distorted . The supports should sit 120 ' apart and about two-thirds of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the mirror area inside the supports and half outside . Three posts support the mirror when the scope is tilted . Nylon washers that barely touch the mirror 's surface prevent the mirror from tipping out of the cell . The PortaScope uses a novel , rectangular alignment system . Most mirror cells use a set of three screws arranged in an equilateral triangle for adjusting the mirror position . Anyone who has aligned a mirror in such a support knows the frustration of having to adjust at least two screws to make the mirror move in a given direction . A rectangular system makes it easy to move the mirror corresponding to the up-and-down and left-and-right directions seen through the focuser . The adjustments use push-pull screws instead of springs . Springs can change tension and allow a single adjustment screw to turn and , thus , affect the mirror alignment . Pairs of screws apply opposing forces to maintain the alignment . Another tiresome aspect of mirror collimation is its back-and-forth procedure  --  look through the focuser to see which way to move the mirror , step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go back to the focuser to see if it was the right way , adjust the screw again , look again , twist another screw , step back and look again , and so on . The PortaScope removes this frustration by using threaded rods that permit you to collimate the scope conveniently from the focuser. lust look through the focuser and turn the two rods until the mirror is situated perfectly . Then tighten the push screws to lock the mirror in place . You should n't have to adjust this cell 's alignment often but when you do , it 'll be a snap . MAKING THE CELL Although this mirror cell has lots of features , making it is easy . From the 3/4 " plywood leftover from making the altazimuth mount , cut a 12 " square and an 11 " square . The larger piece forms the base that attaches to the tube , and the smaller piece forms the support for the mirror . Notch the corners of the 12 " square piece so it can slide over the glue blocks in the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube , producing poor images . Yet the base also needs to act as a light baffle , preventing light reflected by the ground from entering the tube . A solution is to cut three holes near the center of the base . Mark the center of the base and then draw a circle about 4 " in radius . Draw three legs 120deg apart and about 1-1/2 " wide , extending from the center to the edge of the circle . Using a saber saw , cut out the segments between the legs . Drill a 5/16 " hole through the base at its center . Choose the rougher of the two sides of the base to face toward the focuser and countersink the hole on this side . Laying out the mirror support is slightly more complicated . First mark the center of the square . Draw two circles , one of radius 3-1/4 " and the other of radius 5 " . Draw three legs 120deg apart and 1-1/2 " wide from the center until they hit the 3-1/4 " circle . Cut out the segments between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wide extending about 1 " beyond the 5 " circle . Pick one of these tabs as one of the two alignment directions . Along a 90deg angle to this radius , draw another tab outside the 5 " circle . This acts as the second direction of alignment . Cut the mirror support from the 11 " square , keeping outside the tabs and the 5 " - radius circle . Next you need to mark and drill nine holes in the support . Drill an 11/64 " hole in each leg , 3-1/4 " from the center of the support . In two tabs , drill an 3/4 " hole 5-1/8 " from the center . In the tab also used for alignment , drill a 3/4 " hole 5 " from the center and an 11/16 " hole 5-1/2 " from the center . In the second alignment tab , drill an 11/64 " hole 5-1/2 " from the center . The last one is a 5/16 hole at he center of the support . Countersink both sides of this hole . Use the two center holes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support piece until the two alignment tabs are centered along two adjacent edges of the base . With an awl , mark the point in the base below each of the two 11/64 " holes in the tabs . Drill 13/64 " holes in the base at these locations . About 1/2 " inside these holes along a radius through the center of the base , drill 1/4 " holes . Next measure the thickness of your primary mirror . It will probably be 1 " thick . Cut three pieces of 3/4 " - diameter wood dowel with lengths equal to the thickness of the support , mirror , and nylon acorn nut , plus 1/32 " ( about 2-7/16 " ) . Glue the dowels in the 3/4 " holes in the support with the end sticking out of the mirror side . Once the glue dries , cut each dowel along its length , using the 5 " circle as a guide and then cut off the inside part of the split dowel . Test fit the primary mirror . It should slide easily into place inside the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to slide a postage stamp between the mirror and each dowel . Use a rasp to lightly file the dowels until the mirror fits just right . Then drill a 13/64 " hole in the top of each dowel . Remove the mirror and turn the support over . Fasten two brass mending strips 1/2 " inside the two holes in the alignment tabs . These act as a bearing surface for the push screws and should line up with the 1/4 " holes in the base . With both pieces cut out and all the holes drilled , it 's time to paint the mirror cell . Do n't bother sanding the pieces because rough surfaces absorb scattered light better . Just remove any splinters or jagged edges and then paint all surfaces with flat black paint ( do n't get any paint in the holes ) . The first step in assembling the cell is to install the three-point support for the mirror . From the backside of the mirror cell , pass a l " - long 8x32 roundhead screw through the hole in each leg . Fasten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaded inserts in the three 11/64 " holes in the dowels . Check that the top of each insert is flush with the top of the dowels . Install 10x32 threaded inserts in the 1/4 " holes and 8x32 inserts in the 11/64 " holes in the base . The next step is making the ball joint that holds the two pieces of the mirror cell together . Drill a 1/4 " hole through the center of a 7/8 " - diameter wood bead . This acts as the pivot of the alignment system . Pass a 2 " - long 1/4x20 flathead screw through the center hole of the mirror support , through the bead , and then through the base . The bead should rest in two of the countersinks . Place a washer on the screw and secure it loosely with two nuts . If you ca n't get both nuts on , drill deeper countersinks for the bead . he nuts should be tight enough that the wood pieces ca n't slide along the screw but not so tight that the cell ca n't easily pivot about the bead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 6-1/4 " , 7-1/2 " , 15 " , and 17-1/4 " lengths . Screw two nuts and place a washer on the 7-1/4 " and 15 " rods . Insert these rods through the holes in the alignment tabs of the mirror support , slide on another washer on each rod , and screw on two more nuts . Screw these rods into the inserts in the base and then adjust the nuts until the mirror support is spaced evenly above the base . Attach universal joints to the free end of the rods above the mirror support . Screw the 2 " - long 10x32 knob-head screws through the inserts in the base until the screws touch the mending strips . The nearly completed mirror cell is now ready to install in the mirror box . INSTALLING THE MIRROR CELL Remove the door of the mirror box and set it aside . Place the mirror cell about 1 " inside the bottom edge of the box . Check that the base is square to all three sides of the mirror box using a try square and then clamp the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box , drill two holes through each side into the mirror cell base . The 5/32 " holes sit 1-3/8 " from the end of the box and 2 " from the edges . Drill the holes deep enough so they go completely through the box sides and just start to bore into the base of the mirror cell . ( Use tape wrapped around the drill as a depth indicator . ) Countersink these holes for flathead screws . Unclamp the mirror cell and remove it from the box . Drill 1/2 " - deep 1/4 " holes at the four locations on the base just marked . Screw 10x32 threaded inserts into these holes . On a side of the mirror box to the right of the removable door , drill two 3/16 " - diameter holes . The holes start about 1 " from the top of the box ( from the top of the sides , not the 1x4 collar ) ; one is in the center and the other 1 " from the side . Drill the holes at a 25deg angle , that is , nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convenient time to install the primary mirror in its cell . Be careful not to touch the mirror surface as you lower it carefully into the cell . Hold it in place with nylon washers and 1/2 " - long 8x32 screws in the dowels . Replace the mirror cell in the box and secure it with 1-1/4 " - long 8x32 flathead screws . Screw a knob on one end of the 6-1/4 " and 17-1/2 " rods and slide them through the holes in the mirror box . Insert the ends in the universal joints and test that turning the knobs will adjust the mirror position . Take a break , the rest of the parts installation will be easy . GETTING IN FOCUS Installing the focuser is the next step . Assemble the tube and decide which side of the tube will hold the focuser and finderscope . Choose a side that does n't have draw catches to avoid rubbing the catches against the side of the rocker box . Place this side down on your workbench . As mentioned in part one of this series , the diagonal-to-focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the focal length minus this number ( 56 " minus 9 " , or 47 " ) . Mark a spot exactly in the center of the tube 's side 47 " from the mirror . ( Use the edge of a piece of paper to drop a line from the mirror 's surface down to the tape measure . ) Drive a finishing nail through the tube wall to mark this spot on the outside of the tube . A 2 " focuser requires a 28 " clearance hole . The easiest way to cut this is with a hole saw mounted in a drill . ( A 2-1/2 " hole saw is more common and will also work . ) Once the hole is cut , center the focuser in the hole and mark the locations for its mounting holes with an awl . Drill 11/64 " holes at these locations , replace the focuser and fasten it with 1 1/4 " - long 8x32 roundhead screws . Next comes the installation of the diagonal . Follow the directions of the manufacturer carefully to install the mirror in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Installing the support goes roughly like this : Measure the distance from the center of the diagonal to the center of the spider ( about 4-1/2 " ) . Mark this distance from the center of the focuser away from the primary mirror on the outside of the tube . Get an 8 " - wide strip of paper about 60 " long . Wrap this around the tube , ensuring that the edges of the overlapping sections of paper are flush and that the starting end of the paper aligns with the mark on the tube . Mark the upper layer of paper at the overlap . Take the paper off the tube and fold it in half between the end and the mark made at the overlap . Then fold it in half again . Place the paper on the tube and realign the overlap with the mark on the tube . The edge of the paper should also just touch the mark on the tube . Mark the tube at the three paper folds . Check that these locations are centered in each side and then drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spider using 1-1/4 " - long 8x32 screws , checking that the spider is roughly centered in the tube . The screws should be tight enough that the metal legs of the spider sound a " thwong " when plucked . Do n't let the legs twist because that will increase diffraction of the image , resulting in lower contrast images . The next item to install is the finderscope . The PortaScope uses a Telrad reflex sight popular with deep-sky observers . First , choose where you want the finder . A convenient place is near the eyepiece , on the right side of the tube for right-eyed observers and on the left for observers who use their left eye . I prefer to have the reflex mirror of the Telrad even with the focuser for easy viewing . Remove the sight from its base and place the base on the tube where you want the finder . Align the base so it 's parallel with the edge of the tube . Using the two holes in the base as a guide , drill 11/64 " holes through the tube . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Replace the sight on its base and wait until the scope is collimated . Then you can find a star in the scope and use the adjustment screws on the Telrad to bring the field of view into alignment with that of the scope . With the focuser , finder , and all of the optics in place , the final construction step is to mount the two closet flanges on the tube . The first step in this process is to balance the tube . ( Be sure to place a medium-weight eyepiece in the focuser . ) Place a wooden dowel or broomstick on the floor . Set the tube perpendicularly on top , shifting the tube 's position until it balances on the rod . This point will be about 5-1/2 " above the division in the tube . Mark this line on a side without the draw catches . Measure the distance from the tube division to this line and mark a line on the opposite side of the tube . Use the lines to center the closet flanges and secure the flanges with 1 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction finished , the long awaited day of " first light " through the scope is here . But first check out the alignment of the optics so your first view of the Moon or a distant galaxy is n't a disappointing one . A good article on how to collimate your scope 's mirrors appeared in the April 1992 ASTRONOMY , but the outline below describes how to roughly collimate a scope . Take the scope outside during the daytime . Remove the eyepiece from the focuser and install a collimating aid . ( You can make your own by drilling a tiny hole in the center of the top of a 35mm film canister and cutting off the bottom of the can . ) Looking through the hole in the collimating aid , you 'll see the diagonal mirror , a reflection of the primary mirror in the diagonal and , within this reflection , a reflection of the diagonal mirror . The first step is to center the diagonal mirror so it shows the entire primary mirror . You may need to center the spider , move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror , and then fine tune the diagonal 's position by using the three screws on the back of the diagonal support . Once the diagonal is adjusted so the primary appears centered in it , it 's time to adjust the primary . Loosen the push screws at the back of the primary mirror cell . Using the adjustment rods , move the primary until the reflection of the diagonal mirror appears centered in the primary mirror . Gently tighten the push screws to lock this adjustment into place . Then wait for nightfall . Take your PortaScope outside and peer at the Moon , Mars at opposition , the Orion Nebula , the Andromeda Galaxy , and the countless star clusters scattered along the Milky Way from Cassiopeia to Canis Major . Somehow the view will be a little better because you made the scope yourself . <p>
