With commencement season having run its course , with The Graduate celebrating the 30th anniversary of its 1967 release , with seemingly the entire plastics industry having convened in Chicago last month for the triennial national plastics exposition  --  talking point : graffiti-resistant stop signs incorporating innovative plastics technology were only one of more than a thousand new products on display at the exposition  --  it seems like the perfect time to revisit what is arguably the most famous single-word line of dialogue in movie history , " Rosebud " excepted . <P> The scene , in case you 've forgotten , goes like this : at a party celebrating his graduation from college , Benjamin Braddock , the Dustin Hoffman character , is pulled aside by Mr. Maguire , a friend of his parents who hopes to offer some career advice . " I just want to say one word to you , " Mr. Maguire explains , his arm around Benjamin . " Just one word . " <P> " Yes , sir , " responds Benjamin . <P> " Are you listening ? " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Plastics . " <P> In 1967 , of course , this was a laugh line . Back then , plastics was the reigning symbol for everything that was ersatz in American life , for the phoniness and stifling conformity of the adult world Benjamin was being asked to join . The word itself was an epithet , as in " Plastic Pat " Nixon or these Jimi Hendrix lyrics from the song If 6 Was 9 , talked-sung with a straight face and an up-the-Establishment disregard for grammar : " White collared conservative flashing down the street , /Pointing their plastic finger at me . " <P> Audiences today still get the irony of the Graduate line , although the aesthetic context has been altered now that , thanks to the rise of the postmodern sort of irony , cheesiness has hip cachet and plastic is no longer anathema . Indeed , the movie 's mise-en-scene now has unintended resonances . While the filmmakers ' intent was to fashion " a scarifying picture of the raw vulgarity of the swimming-pool rich , " as Bosley Crowther wrote 30 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when commentators were concerned with the social pathologies of the rich rather than the poor ) , today 's young audiences may find themselves entranced rather than repelled by the movie 's upscale ticky-tacky decor and more likely to respond to the sound track 's cha-cha lounge music than to its earnest baby-boom lullabies by Simon and Garfunkel . The generation gap has come full circle . Kids today  --  they 'd rather play Rat Pack in Vegas than run off with Katharine Ross on a bus to self-actualizationland . Plastics won . <P> Or , as Jack LaCovey , director of communications for the Society of the Plastics Industry ( SPI ) , puts it , " We had a bad rap , but that 's changed now that people realize you can make plastic products with high precision and high performance . " Mr. Maguire 's advice , generally speaking , was sound : over the past 30 years , the plastics industry has grown faster than the nation 's gross domestic product . " The Graduate got it right , " says Allan Cohen , who studies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of wisdom in that film . "
