<p> As we are pulled ever closer to the 21st century , the 1800s become more and more remote . <p> Whether it 's political figures , wars or westward expansion , the voices of those who created those times are becoming fainter . Among this year 's Christmas bonanza of history books is ' Witness to America , ' chock-full of eyewitness accounts of events ; the building of the first transcontinental railroad and the fiery dialogue of abolitionist Frederick Douglass . <p> In addition , World War II , now a half century in the past , continues to get a lot of attention as historians rush to gather first-hand information from those who were there . <p> Witness to America . Stephen Ambrose and Douglas Brinkley , editors . ( HarperCollins , $ 39.95 ) . <p> Traditional historians tend to disdain first-person accounts as frequently inaccurate and lacking in perspective . <p> But it is people , not events , who make history come alive . <p> ' Witness to America , ' 170 short pieces on U.S. history from the Boston Tea Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box of chocolates , except the reader finds a nougat in every bite . Flip it open , find a short remembrance by John D. Rockefeller on the early days of the oil industry , an eyewitness account of George Washington 's arrival in new York City as president or a reporter 's terrifying experiences in the Chicago Fire . <p> In diaries , newspaper articles , essays and retrospectives , writers as diverse as Walt Whitman and Hunter S. Thompson talk about the America of their times . Franklin Roosevelt , Booker T. Washington , Nathaniel Hawthorne and John Brown make observations on plain folks , too , such as Stuart Henry 's eyewitness tale of the grasshopper plague that swept across the Great Plains in 1874 . <p> ' Witness to America , ' is , in fact , the further adventures of the United States , because the original ' Heritage to America , ' an anthology edited by Henry Steele Commager and Allan Nevins in 1949 , covered the period up to the nuclear attack on Japan . Ambrose and Brinkley carry the book forward to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which we are being hurled into the 21st century . <p> Except for its five-pound weight , ' Witness ' would be a great bathroom read . As it stands , it is a tempting introduction into our rich cultural history that one hopes will encourage readers , particularly younger ones , to pursue the topics even more . It also comes with a CD-ROM on which historic speeches and moments are re-created by actors . <p> The Code Book . By Simon Singh . ( Doubleday , $ 24.95 ) . <p> With the Navajo code writers of World War II very much in the news , ' The Code Book ' is illuminating background on what makes a good cipher go bad . <p> Simon Singh , who made mathematics a hot topic in ' Fermat 's Enigma , ' does the same for the ancient art of sending secrets to your friends without your enemies being able to read what you said about them . Beginning with Mary Queen of Scots losing her head because a clever opponent unlocked the key to her cipher , Singh demonstrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages . <p> The mind boggles at the mental gymnastics that go into creating convoluted secret-keepers . Singh also includes do-it-yourself code ideas and a chance for readers to win $ 15,000 by cracking a 10-step cipher text . Pencils ready ? Begin . <p> Empire Express : Building the First Transcontinental Railroad . By David HawardBain . ( Viking , $ 34.95 ) . <p> The construction of the transcontinental railroad is territory as familiar as the oft-seen photographs of early-day trains blocked by herds of buffalo . <p> But David Haward Bain , a self-confessed train buff from age 11 , delves into the story of the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific more deeply than any of the previous chroniclers of one of the great engineering feats of the 19th century . This includes Maury Klein 's two-part history of the UP , generally regarded as one of the best business studies ever written . <p> Where Klein concentrated on the front-office machinations ( and there were plenty , in and out of government ) , Bain spent 14 years researching the paper trail of diaries , letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how the coast-to-coast rail line , which finally bonded the country , came to pass . <p> It was not a place for Boy Scouts . Land deals , payoffs and political finagling were commonplace , and those who physically built the line were tough , hardened men who attracted all kinds of hangers-on . <p> Bain notes that construction created its own society : ' when the end of track would be pushed farther west and the laborers moved on , the camp followers would simply fold up their tents , dismantle their gimcrack structures , crate their whiskey and corral their women , and ship them out to the new end of track to start up all over again . ' <p> When the deed had been done , the inevitable questions followed , leading to exposure of the Credit Mobilier scandal , one which swept over the good names of many politicians , including Vice President Schuyler Colfax , whose political career was left in shambles . <p> ' Empire Express ' is more than a study of the building of a railroad . It encompasses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans , women , settlers , con men and speculators in one of man 's greatest accomplishments . It is not , however , a quick read . Any book with 23 pages of bibliographies deserves careful attention . <p> The Greatest War : Americans in Combat 1941-1945 . By Gerald Astor . ( Presidio Press , $ 39.95 ) . <p> World War II is a happening . The worldwide conflict has been thrust back into the public consciousness by notable anniversaries , the film ' Saving Private Ryan ' and Stephen Ambrose 's books on the common man at war . <p> In a whopping 1,000 pages , Gerald Astor , the author of seven books on WWII , merges hundreds of personal interviews and oral histories to recount combat in both theaters of the war . It 's not a pretty sight . <p> Astor makes no attempt to make sense of the ' bigger picture , ' content to let the veterans tell their tales of exhilaration , fear , death and heroism . The landing at Normandy is well-trod ground , but other , less significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' The Greatest War ' churns familiar soil for those who have bothered to research it . But with some 30,000 veterans of ' the Big One ' passing into history every month , it wo n't be long before their memories , captured by enthusiasts such as Gerald Astor , are all we have . <p> Frederick Douglass : Selected Speeches and Writings . Edited by Philip S. Foner , abridged and adapted by Yuval Taylor . ( Lawrence Hill , $ 35 ) . <p> Known as one of the great orators of his time , Frederick Douglass also was a remarkable man of letters and the pre-eminent black intellectual of the 19th century . <p> This volume , part of the Library of Black America , is a re-issue of a collection of Douglass ' writings first published in four volumes between 1950 and 1955 and a fifth volume published in 1975 . All are out of print . <p> The power and depth of Douglass ' battle against racism is typified in a piece he wrote in 1849 called ' Colorphobia in New York ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his encounters on the streets of New York while walking down Broadway with two white women friends . <p> Thirty-nine years later , he is speaking just as passionately and effectively in favor of suffrage for women , forecasting ' the final triumph of woman 's cause , not only in this country but throughout the world . ' <p> A History of the Twentieth Century . Volume Three : 1952-1999 . By Martin Gilbert ( Morrow , $ 35 ) . <p> The modestly titled ' Twentieth Century , ' a 953-page tome , would more properly be titled ' An Almanac of the Twentieth Century . " <p> Sir Martin Gilbert , whose works include a massive , eight-volume history of Winston Churchill , has compiled facts and figures , one chapter for each year of the last half of the century . Rather than probing each subject in depth , Gilbert skims the surface of a broad range of topics . In Chapter 41 ( 1992 ) , for example , we learn in successive paragraphs that ( a. ) 1,000 Hutus were executed , ( b. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and Great Britain and ( c. ) 5,000 people died of starvation in Somalia . <p> An exception to these brief overviews is the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam quagmire , a recurring subject for Gilbert , as it was for Americans . <p> If ' Twentieth Century , ' written in a crisp matter-of-fact style , is n't a full-bodied picture of our world , it should point the way for those who want to know more . Many maps at the back of the book make finding the world hot spots easy . <p> Virtual History . Edited by Niall Ferguson . ( Basic Books , $ 40 ) . <p> ' What-if ' is a popular parlor game for science-fiction buffs and others with vivid imaginations . ' Virtual History , ' a re-release of a 1997 British volume , looks at key moments in world history and wonders , among other things , what if there had been no American Revolution , Hitler had invaded Great Britain and President Kennedy had n't been assassinated . <p> Of course we 'll never know , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90-page introduction to explain with convoluted phrases ' the determinism of ecclesiastical history ' and ' our predisposition to think counterfactually . ' <p> By the way , if Kennedy had n't died , says historian Diane Kunz , it would n't have changed things because he was , at best , a mediocre president . Conjecture is fun .
