Choosing to kidnap the priest may be a mistake . I admit it . Nobody cares about Catholics anymore . The church is a franchise , like McDonald 's or Burger King . But the move 's bound to bring attention to the institute . <p> We 've considered taking a doctor instead . They 're as bad as priests . Worse . They wait till you 're sick , till you have no choice . Then they have you , and everything you own . Illness is a big part of our death cult . Once people were n't afraid of dying . They knew it had to happen . Nowadays there 's a hope we might escape it completely , so let it rip . <p> My father wanted me to work for the CIA . " Do your country some good , " he advised . He hoped in this way to placate the old world ghosts that haunted him periodically . " He ' s after me again , Mother , " I 'd complain . " Do n't listen , " she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with one of the Great Books of the Western World , until he found me . <p> " Rake the lawn , " he 'd insist . Routine preparations for a life of espionage . <p> You 'd never believe how many trees there used to be in New Jersey . Come fall , you 'd think you were in the Black Forest instead of suburbia . <p> That was long ago . I have n't been back since my parents died . <p> I never did learn what claim the ghosts had on my temperamental , hard-working father . <p> It is December , according to man . Christmas approaches . Eventually the Berlin Wall crumbled . East European dissidents became heads of state . Communism is history . Who can say what will happen here in the next millennium ? <p> It wo n't be just the information highway , I assure you . Our last president was a murderer . Panamanians died in the streets so that we could watch The Simpsons in peace . <p> But what 's the date on the real calendar , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil on California ? <p> I 'm in my study at the Institute , making notes on my Mac . Jose 's preparing areppas and squid for lunch . Cooking is his spiritual discipline . The kitchen is his temple . Hot pepper his holy ghost . We are what we do , and daily , each minute , each second , we choose . Soon the five of us meet to discuss the month 's agenda . It will be a busy season . <p> The Institute , where we live , is in a sprawling house in Somerville . It 's a working-class city , mainly Italian and Irish , streaked with Haitian . I 'd call it cosmopolitan , if that did n't suggest a glamour this place never had . Think of Paris without lights , without art , without original or interesting architecture . Triple deckers , thickets of antennas , rooms decorated with sea shells . Houses like shipwrecks . Islands of lost souls . There are no pockets of flamboyant wealth in Somerville , no Brattle Streets , Rues Vaugirard , Fifth Avenues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third most densely populated city in the world . After Hong Kong , and I forget where else . Each shanty 's flanked on either side by a gas station or a muffler repair shop . Everywhere garages , car wash palaces , auto parts emporiums . The working class never shifted allegiance from engine to microchip . Mild-looking madonnas in cerulean gowns grace the yards of the older residents . Christmas lights tacked to the shingles , on night and day , make the city seem a poor man 's Candyland . <p> Do n't get me wrong , I love it , and how . <p> The natives toil in these garages , in local factories , stuffing pillows , stocking food on grocery shelves ( compare Barsamian 's to Pantry Pride : it 's East and West Berlin ) , selling papers , serving food , tending bar , typing letters for insurance agents or third-rate lawyers , plowing roads for the DPW , minding tills in hardware stores , scraping pasta dishes in restaurant kitchens ; they 're the regular people of this world . Passably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrious ( though leaving time in the day for seven hours of television ) , and undeniably good . Through the window I see a woman tossing bits of hot-dog bun to the birds ; rumpled Barney in his mashed fedora rapping with the brats returning from school . Little acts of kindness abound . When Anthony 's Bar caught fire , Willie , who owns the pizza joint across the street , raced into the burning box to save Emilio 's black Japanese goldfish . <p> These people even seem to like what they do . <p> For that , I hate them . They let themselves be the coal and the oil in the stoves and the roaring furnaces of the rich . <p> I 'd rather they were the dynamite . <p> I think a lot about the former president . He and I are linked . We 're tied , kin , in cahoots . I know it . How else explain why he outraged me so ? I took his decisions personally . I felt responsible . He was my man in Washington . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires . Am I wrong ? " You take life too personally , " my ex-wife said , with never a hint of what else I might focus on . <p> If the president vetoed a bill I supported , or appointed a judge whose disinterest I doubted , I grieved . I wanted to call , explain his mistake to him . When he cut certain programs , I brooded : was I really that mean , that selfish ? <p> It was n't just the president that worried me . It was his wife , his marriage , his dog . Were they happy ? Did they not see that our interests were twined , and competition a ruse ? <p> Wasyl 's in the next room , studying the Bhagavad-Gita . He dropped acid this morning  --  hence the music , the spasmodic laughter . <p> He 's of the Slavic persuasion . It 's bad for him to read religious books . He ' s shaky , nervous . Thinks he ' s a poet . Recites Whitman at me . " Song of Myself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And to him , it 's news . He contains multitudes . He 's eager ( far too , I want to tell him , but will teach him instead ) to sound his barbaric yawn on television . He 's also tall , nice looking , and charming when not high . I recognize the temperament . Doomed , utterly doomed . Of course , at his age ( twenty ) , doom 's the thing . He 's delighted to be doomed . He ca n't wait to die , flamboyantly , and in public . Preferably on prime time . <p> It wo n't be easy weaning him off these religious texts . I know the pull . He responds without knowing to what . Nor has he any sense of how to reconcile youth 's frenzies with the discipline of a true religious calling . We 'll have to have it out before long . <p> It 'll be harder curing him of TV . <p> The young naturally incline toward slime and the sublime , romantic love and narcissistic lust . I speak from experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption . Too crude for hypocrisy , they settle for the franker lies at the extremes . They 're Gnostics , Manichaeans . I aim to help them integrate . <p> Besides , he 's hot for Deirdre . And I 've seen the way she bends in his direction , as though reminding him of her breasts , how she drops her flecked blue eyes when he stares , or how her anxious hand flies to her hair , fingers flitting between loose strawberry clumps like fat flustered birds . <p> Does either know I know ? I do n't think so . Therefore , I can play . <p> Are squirrels willing to die for their trees ? To armor themselves in suits of leaf and twig and hurl chestnuts at each other ? I mean , I get the business of guarding the nest . That I understand . It ' s the question of the tree that interests me . Its roots go underground . They 're nibbled by grubs , they overlap with other trees . Impossible to say just where they end . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their daddies did for them . How they set them up in the world . Did the president ? Not often , not much . Yet was he more than his daddy 's shadow ? <p> Deirdre watches another invasion on television . She wears a lace nightie I gave her last Christmas : whorls of transparent beige over her breasts . On the screen , soldiers in dappled green and brown race through a maze of shacks hugging rifles close to their chests . Cut to a scene downtown : people exit stores clutching consumer goods like tins , radios , fabric . Cut to a scene of the president hunting quail . They do n't look hard to kill . Back to the invasion : houses burning , bodies in the street . The stubby fingers of her left hand pinch <p> nipple . Her other hand moves too . It ' s not clear who is slaughtering whom and for what . A herd of neatly dressed men and women stand on a hill , raising cans of cola to the sky . She takes the empty rum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalist blabs earnestly about the big push , the high spirits of the poor , many of whose shacks are burning . Peasants cheer the soldiers . Finger in mouth like a popsicle , the other hand restless . <p> The revolution : the words heft her to a hill on which she sees herself standing in silhouette , fist accusing the sky . Or she sees herself kicking a nun  --  Sister Mary Ann , maybe  --  in the stomach , with a steel-toed shoe , pressing that boot down on the withered lips she 'd seen so often mouthing the rosary or scolding her students , breaking down in the middle of a lesson on the Pythagorean theorem , screaming about how the devil wanted their souls and how he 'd get them through their bodies , her white face twisted , like braided dough with a punched hole for a mouth , and her words bursting out like pebbles of fire , who once slapped her three times when she caught Deirdre in a lie , then made her sit on her hands at the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a thistle of wrath . <p> She will never have children . She has no wish to make more people . <p> There are terrible vibes around me , coming from my fellows at the Institute . I feel them acutely . <p> Humans are very tough on each other . But they need to learn somehow . <p> Because real-life lessons occur outside the university , a place such as the Institute for Imaginative Living is indispensable . We study the things they do n't teach you in school . Our students bone up on betrayal , blackmail , beating , chicanery , corruption , cruelty , embezzlement , fanaticism , flattery , flirtation , fraud , incest ( via role-playing ) , lying , racism , sexism , stealing from petty cash , etc. , all in a structured environment . We teach ambition , greed , lust , jealousy , rage . We drive people to these states so they can later learn to control them . It 's not easy . But , as I said to Wasyl : no pain , no gain . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as never before in our history . There 's no war around to teach our boys the ways of men . The few remaining unofficial interventions in Africa and Latin America are n't enough . Semi-clandestine experiences do n't seep out into the larger population . Only an elite sees first-hand what people are capable of . Iraq was just the thing , but too brief . Bosnia shows us just how soft we are . This leaves us vulnerable . Those whose parents suffered under brutish third-world or Eastern European regimes enjoy an advantage . Followed by kids whose fathers trained in Iraq , Vietnam , Korea , or WWII . Unfortunately , as we know , young people discount their parents ' truths . <p> Of course , we have no students . There are just the five of us for now . But the core is strong , the center holds . And will , until the time comes to explode . <p> There is no effect without a cause . The lightning that breaks in singing branches over Winter Hill this morning is but the discharge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this December day . The bird feeder on the ground was knocked from the window by a squirrel disappointed by the scraps Deirdre tossed it . The reason Comrade Kesselburger retches in the john is because of last night 's rounds of Jim Beam  --  probably in company with one of his lady friends from that bar in Boston 's Combat Zone . I 'm not worried about him . The Comrade will pull through . After puking , he 'll shamble back into his study and write verses for two hours ( I do n't think I 've ever met an American who had n't at one time or another been a writer ) . By lunch , when we have our meeting , he 'll be fully restored . <p> Jose puts the plate of squid down in the middle of the table . I spear a rubbery tentacle . Sushi-style . <p> I stare at the marbled rose elbow , the pale suction cups . <p> Wasyl sticks to the areppas , toasted , with cheese . <p> There 's little talk during the meal . K. hiccups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Do n't pay . " <p> " Ah , that 's the one thing you do , even as a revolutionary  --  " <p> " Got ta pay your bills , " Deirdre smiles , easing his dismay . <p> " In fact , kid , where 's your share ? Have n't you been handing out those coupons in the Square ? " <p> " We need paper , or there wo n't be any more newsletters . " <p> " Charge for it , charge for it , then you wo n't have to worry . " <p> " You mean , force the people to pay for the truth ? No way . Then we 'd be no different from them . " <p> " Your turn with the dishes , " Jose adds to his burden . And if that 's not enough : <p> " And when the liberating 's done ? What will we do ? " <p> " Money . We 'll make money . " <p> We chose the priest from St. Michael 's because he should know better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We attended some dozen masses before concluding he was our man . It was n't even boring . I remembered going to church with my parents . Father staring gravely at the golden candlesticks , Mother looking pious , mouthing prayers . <p> Wasyl 's trying to understand this desperate place in which he finds himself . He cranks the volume up on the TV . How crucial television is , even to literary types of this next generation . The least taste of it nurtures a craving . " It 's the world , " Wasyl explained . " It puts you in touch . You see everything . It 's global , man . How else can you get perspective ? " <p> You know what 's missing from the scene today ? Character . No one has character anymore . People treat people like they were television . Tired of this conversation ? Sick of that peculiarity ? Weary of her accent , the same small breasts , the semi-hard penis ? Turn the channel . Pop in a video . Go to a bar . Dial for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins . <p> No effect without a cause . But who can isolate that cause inside a sentence ? <p> My cousin never claimed he had a soul left . He knew he 'd struck a Faustian bargain . That 's not so with priests and popes . <p> I walk up Highland Avenue , past the variety store , recently bought by a Paki couple , who hired a local kid to front for them after someone broke their window , and around the corner from Anthony 's , past the shop selling baseball cards , the laundromat , the antique store next to the rock-climbing center ( you read about them in the paper only when they fail ) . <p> I 'm a stranger here , staring blankly in the windows , puzzled by the zeal with which people engage in these deadening tasks . What drives them , I wonder . What to do they hope to achieve ? For whom are they working ? <p> Racing clouds skim the city . There 's no breaking through anymore . Just keep moving , place to place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everyone 's Irish . It 's one of those days . A glance tells the story . Blue eyes blinking everywhere . Some days it 's Jews , others Italians , or blacks . Rarely Turks or Armenians . I check to make sure I 'm wearing no orange . No green , either . Because they 'll find out . This cosmopolitanism 's a veneer . They 'll see I 'm not one of them . And they 'll hunt me down . And they 'll string me up . Then smoke me and serve me with kippers . Are kippers Irish or English ? Excuse me , British . What , for that matter , are kippers ? How are you feeling today ? Oh , quite kipper , thank you . Care for a kipper , kiddo ? Kip kip , and all that sort of rot . So much to remember . Such signals to learn . How not panic ? <p> The high school on my left 's a fine building , on the outside . Clean , fortress-like . Inside , the kids carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon AIDS , worse than heart attacks because it 's death by sex . By love . Which should n't happen . <p> Two kids wielding hockey sticks and wearing baseball caps run by . Suddenly I feel the urge to join them , start running myself , follow them toward their field of play . <p> Instead , I keep walking . Heavy , old , and lost . <p> Everything is possible , nothing necessary . <p> My wife said I practiced a politics of bitterness . Bitterness ? Ah no , I 'd reply : betterness . I reject what is because I believe things can always be better . <p> And does the philosophy work ? If one can speak of a philosophy working . To tell the truth , I 'm losing faith . How close we come to achieving what we want . How close . And how surprising the obstacles that arise , over and over , making perfection seem possible , and just out of reach . <p> Do n't kid yourselves : I want to be healthy . I want to want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroller : she 's done it . How ? <p> Lately my life 's shining through the fray of theory and it frightens me . I duck into Patty 's Lunch for coffee . A group of boys crowds round the video game in the doorway . They part politely , letting me pass . Waiting for my coffee , I study them , these beings infected by health , possibility , the future . They 're wearing Catholic school uniforms . Probably from Saint Michael ' s . The priest ' s face , draped with flesh , pissed me off . His blue eyes : cliche , cliche . Those ridiculous robes . The whole costume in this age of geopolitics , ICBMs , CDs . A smug shaman in a post-Jetson 's world . <p> Through the window I study the Greek blue of the sky , clouds gone , the trees dark charcoal stubble , and everywhere plumes of spirit , visible evidence of our miserable human souls flowering also from the lips and nostrils of the passersby , hurrying to their offices and shops . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragging them this way and that . It 's fear that drives them , fear of the street , of the poorhouse , that beats the drum to which they step . This society keeps people scared . That 's how it works . It scares them with threats : of the street , bankruptcy , Chapter 11 . Such shadowy glimpses of the future keep people in line , keep them imprisoned . Keep the heart tight . Money rules . Look over your shoulder : money rules . Do n't trust anyone : money rules . Mother and father ? Do n't kid yourself , money rules there too . Family life floats on the tides of currency . Does your family love you ? Maybe . But can they show their love by helping you ? Not if they 're poor . What is it like , being poor ? I 'll tell you . It means heart beating fast night and day and it means not looking into your neighbor 's eyes , means steady pressure around the heart , sweat and dry mouth , means not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave your bad check around ; means not answering the phone and then losing it anyway ; means shame , means rage at everyone , not just the people in the nice cars , but them especially . You 're tired of saying to yourself : well , in third-world countries , millions have no heat , millions are hungry , are homeless . But you live here . Rage , night and day . Often stifled , often submerged , often transformed . But there , pulsing below . The poor divorce at twice the rate of couples with money . The poor live in dangerous neighborhoods in high-risk families . Everyone knows how vulnerable the poor are . Even the weather knows . The weather persecutes the poor . Trailer parks in Kansas get wiped out in a twinkling and towns in Florida are destroyed overnight . <p> As to the ex-president , I have a confession to make . <p> He is not my cousin . He is no relation to me . None . <p> And what do I know of the pope ? Nothing . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . My God . Those lips . It 's not right for an anarchist to so love the flesh ; yet I do , I do . I love a woman ' s hair , and shoulders , and smell . I 'd like to swim ten thousand seasons in the sea of one woman without shore . <p> Wasyl 's with her . He 's talking . Always talking . <p> What worries me  --  there 's always something-is the car , a Yugo ' 82 , a nice machine , dented and tired , which sometimes goes quiet as a cat in the middle of traffic . What if we have the priest and are racing away and the car dies ? <p> Sometimes I enjoyed mass . I felt a twinge , once or twice . Near the end . When people turn to each other and shake hands . How curious , and in a way , beautiful , the whole business was . The colored lights in the painted glass , the costumes , the candles . And then , strangers suddenly turning to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate the church because it 's so near the truth , it 's intolerable . The cross is like the atom diagrammed , confusing people until they find a way of seeing through it , seeing beyond . Who would n't love it , when you stop to think ? Who would n't weep ? <p> Maybe we should just forget the priest . <p> The girl behind the counter . Greasy white outfit , blue striped collar . I see through it , to the figure underneath , its glorious promise and hunger . <p> After my wife left  --  suddenly , no warning , though she claimed there were signs a plenty I began reading the Bible , looking for what it said about love between men and women . And you know what ? Nothing . Nothing there . Every reference to love has to do with God . Any wonder things screw up in this arena ? The Bible never specifically prohibits screwing in sand dunes or saunas , with teachers and their girlfriends , or exotic dancers using devices ... nothing is said . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to play . It does n't teach you how to tell love from lust . <p> Maybe I should have listened to the old man . Joined the CIA . Hitched to Alaska . Gone whaling . <p> I look around . The place is empty . The girl cuts cheese on the slicer , her back to me . <p> Done , I push away from the counter and head for the door . <p> The cold welcomes me back . <p>
