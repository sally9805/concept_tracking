26,000 YEARS That which does not kill us makes us stronger .  --  Friedrich Nietzsche // On the eve of the Civil War , Sandersville was a dusty village nestled in east-central Georgia . With a population of about five hundred people , the hamlet was a typical small Georgian settlement with roots in the colonial period . The first white settlers in the area started as yeomen , scouring the land of trees and verdure to create and homesteads . Increased European immigration into the region during the late eighteenth century led to frontier conflicts with Native Americans , who quickly found the early treaties  --  and their observance by white settlers  --  disappointing . Sandersville , as an official unit of government , was not legislated into existence until the 1790s when a Mr. Saunders , in response to an act of the state government , donated part of his plantation to Washington County for the establishment of the county seat , Saunderville . By 1812 , the village , now known as Sandersville , had become a stagecoach stop and relay station , its importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby Milledgeville. ( 1 ) // During the early nineteenth century , Middleton Pool Jr. , a white immigrant from North Carolina , was among the more notable settlers to arrive in Sandersville . Pool , along with his father , Middleton Sr. , and brother , James , had come to the area primarily to claim land that was being doled out by the Georgian land lottery in 1805 . Although the senior died in that same year , Middleton Jr . and James subsequently settled near Bold Springs in Washington County. ( 2 ) // By the standards of the antebellum rural South , Middleton Pool Jr . fared well in the social and political milieu of central Georgia . In 1820 , he was commissioned justice of the peace for the one hundredth Georgia Militia District and , four years later , served as an extra member of the Georgian House of Representatives . An attendee of the Darien Baptist Church , Pool had by the 1830s acquired a venerable status in the community and , commensurate with his influence , was one of five commissioners selected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His most significant achievements , however , were in finance and real estate , which undoubtedly enchanced his political and social prestige in Washington County . According to the 1850 census , Pool , at age seventy-two , owned thousands of dollars in assets , not the least of which were twenty-two slaves. ( 3 ) // Only weeks after the State of Georgia formally seceded from the United States on January 19 , 1861 , Middleton Pool died and bequeathed the lion 's share of his estate to his children . Among his survivors was his forty-one-year-old daughter , Jane Irwin Swint , who had become a widow following the death of her husband , John Swint , sometime earlier . Pool 's will provided well for Jane and the others ; she received 215 acres of land valued at $1,184.62 . Additionally , Jane was given other valuables for her upkeep and comfort , including " Lucky a woman and her increaor offspring , e horse saddle and bridle two cows and calves a bed and furniture and also a negro woman named Easter and a boy named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial and human implications , was a common one in the pre-Civil War South . Casually listed with cows and furniture , slaves and their prospective progeny were routinely passed from owner to owner just as other properties were . Georgian slavery was already a century old when Jane Swint received her inheritance . Nonetheless , she lived in interesting times when such perfunctory events as the reading of the wills of slaveholders fed the fires of sectional crisis and national disunity. ( 4 ) // The Southern ancien regime that had allowed people such as Jane Swint to own people such as Lucky , Easter , and Irwin collapsed under the stress of four years of war . The denouement for Georgia 's house of bondage came in the spring of 1864 . With the avowed intention of making Confederates " so sick of war that generations would pass away before they would again appeal to it , " Gen. William Sherman and his Union Army blazed a fiery swath from northern Georgia to Savannah , stopping in tiny Sandersville to impress upon rebels there the futility of resistance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found only a handful of wooden shops , a few homes , three brick buildings , and a courthouse square . A Confederate cavalry unit under Joe Wheeler launched a brief defensive action , and Union prisoners taken from rebel stockades were massacred . Federal troops led by Sherman , however , brought superior force to bear on the town , compelling the defenders to quit Sandersville altogether on November 26 . The triumphant Union general , who had frequently visited brutality and suffering upon civilians  --  ranging from freed blacks to ardent Confederate sympathizers  --  his army had encountered during the campaign , abstained from burning dwellings , but did allow his men to raze the courthouse ( " a handsome Greek Revival building of stuccoed brick " ) , the local jail , and the railroad depot in the adjacent town of Tennille . Like so many other parts of Georgia , Sandersville was simply another refrain in Sherman 's anthem to total war. ( 5 ) // Irwin , the black youth passed down to Jane Swint as a perpetual servant , was fourteen years old when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His experiences in slavery are lost to history , but he did apparently exhibit a pious disposition in his early adulthood and would eventually be " called " to preach . Following emancipation , Irwin courted and married a fair-skinned mulatto woman named Peggy , who bore him a son , William . At this time , African-Americans in Georgia , as well as the South in general , were testing the limits of their newly acquired freedom . Seven hundred blacks attended a Sandersville rally on July 4 , 1867 , organized by John T. Costin , an African-American minister , and Macon politician Jefferson Long for the purpose of shoring up support for the Republican Party . The presence of Union troops coupled with federal legislation made black suffrage , for the first time in Georgian history , a reality , though brief in duration and limited in scope . For Irwin Pool and other freedpeople in the South , however , freedom and power in an agrarian society stripped of liquid capital by four years of war were not so much based on access to the ballot box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These prerequisites of economic empowerment and social mobility were , for the vast majority of African-Americans , unattainable given the federal government 's lack of commitment to sweeping land reform . Even though the price of land in Georgia in 1870 was half that of 1860 , hostile local governments , indifferent banks , and the smoldering ashes of white supremacy still managed to limit ex-slaves in almost all spheres of economic activity . Ten years after Sherman torched the Peach State , blacks , who constituted over 40 percent of the population , owned just 338,769 acres of Georgian land , or less than 1 percent. ( 6 ) // Reconstruction was stumped out of Georgia by the Ku Klux Klan and other white redeemers by the early 1870s . Facing a future of closed ballot boxes and empty pockets , most African-Americans were forced into some kind of labor arrangement with either their former masters or other propertied whites . The Pools sharecropped as did 90 percent of black Georgians by 1890 , when cotton production experienced a resurgence . William , like his father before him , received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century and , for the next several decades , ministered to the spiritual needs of blacks who would listen . On January 9 , 1887 , William married Mariah Hall , a local woman whose family had roots in Washington County . Mariah 's mother , Ellen , was a mulatto , fathered by a slave master who had raped her enslaved mother . Very light in complexion , Ellen had been separated from her mother through sale during slavery . Her white half-brother was reportedly a state senator in Georgia , and though she avoided discussing her lineage , later in life she periodically visited her white relatives . In describing her affinity for their father 's descendants , one black relative said of Ellen , " She was half and half , and she looked it , and act it . " ( 7 ) // In a cosmetic way , Sandersville seemed to prosper during the turn of the century . Though a fire ravaged the downtown area in 1888 and again in 1893 , many of the town 's buildings were redesigned in brick , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural touches hardly masked the gnawing poverty that gripped the majority of the 25,237 inhabitants of Washington County , especially the African-American community , which made up 59 percent of the population . For them , the emergence of Jim Crow , a devastating depression , and lynching turned poor prospects into an even worse predicament . Declining cotton prices strengthened the chains of peonage and penury for both sharecropper and cash renter alike . While a few more blacks managed to secure titles to land , their share of Georgian real estate , even at its peak in 1920 , never accounted for more than 5 percent of the available land , though African-Americans made up over two-fifths of the state 's population . As a morbid exclamation point to the misery endured by its black majority , Washington County experienced a record amount of snowfall and low temperatures in the winter of 1899 . During February 12-13 , twelve inches of snow blanketed the rustic town accompanied by temperatures below zero . In that same year , the state of Georgia itself set another kind of record : twenty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 8 ) // Mariah Poole believed in dreams. ( 9 ) When she was seven years old , she claimed to have had a vision that one day she would give birth to a male child of preeminent stature and importance . During his lifetime , this youth would come into contact with " a great power , " perhaps a divine presence , which would change the course of human affairs . While life was hard in Sandersville , and matters of divine destiny seemed to carry little weight compared to the material reality of deprivation around her , Mariah held on to this preternatural vision , this prophecy , for a lifetime. ( 10 ) // The Poole family grew quickly during the 1890s . First , there was Annie , born in 1889 , followed by William Jr . ( Billie ) , fornie ( Tommie ) , Hattie , and Lula . A second male baby was born in October 1897 , a child who seemed somehow different from the rest and who , at least temporarily , eased the rather vapid lives of the Pooles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grandfather , was pampered from the beginning and became the favorite among the other children . When Annie first held him a week after his birth , she was enamored of his appearance . " He was a beautiful baby , " she recalled some years later . " He had beautiful black eyes . I just loved him . " His grandfather teasingly called baby Elijah " the Prophet " and predicted that he would one day be just that. ( 11 ) // As necessity required , William and Mariah labored assiduously to provide for their children . Between sharecropping for various local farmers and working in sawmills . William pastored Bold Spring Baptist Church and Union Baptist Church . His wife , like so many other black women , worked as a domestic for local white families , receiving only a fraction of the wages that working males commanded . Mariah was often paid in kind for her labor , and many days she came home with pig 's feet , chitterlings , and other less desirable parts of slaughtered animals , instead of the cash wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was pregnant again with a seventh child. ( 12 ) // For unknown reasons , the Pooles left Sandersville in 1990 , probably during the latter part of the year . The departure , which was not necessarily abrupt , was perhaps related to William 's occupation as a minister as well as conflicts in his personal life . Possibly the family relocated because of prospects for a more comfortable lifestyle elsewhere . William might simply have paid the family 's debts , secured a pastorate in the new locale , and moved the family at the first opportunity . Unfortunately , it is equally possible that the family left Sandersville amidst rumor and scandal . Sometime during the turn of the century , William allegedly fathered a male child , Lonnie , by a local woman named Vinnie Poole . The details of the affair are elusive , but it seems substantiated by some evidence . The resulting opporbrium , high-lighted by a sparser attendance at church meetings and peculiar stares from neighbors and others , probably forced William 's hand and led to a voluntary exile from Sandersville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Washington County for good and set our for move verdant pastures in south-central Georgia. ( 13 ) // When the Poole family arrive in Cordele in 1900 , the small town , located in Dooly ( later Crip ) County , was undergoing significant changes . Incorporated in 1888 with a population of three hundred , Cordele attracted both a national highway and a railway . By World War I , it boasted a Telephone Exchange building , a well-constructed water and sewerage system , electric lights , three newspapers , and other amenities as well as an expanding downtown area that included two cottonseed-oil mills , an ice factory , four hotels , three fertilizer plants , and two bottling plants , which serviced and employed the city 's growing population of 8,250 . Segregation in Cordele , as it had been in Sandersville , was de rigueur , and the African-American community was , of course , the worse off for it . Sharecropping and renting were the typical occupations of Cordele 's black majority , but some limited opportunities in mills and factories attracted men like William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have greatly improved the Pooles ' economics status , but it perhaps rehabilitated the social standing of William Poole . Accordingly , the pastor found a new niche among the black Baptists of Cordele and mounted the pulpit once again. ( 14 ) // Church attendance for the Poole children was mandatory and , for at least Elijah , often pleasurable . By age four , he was allowed to sit in the " preached set , " where he was admired by members of the congregation as his father delivered his sermons . Elijah was deeply impressed by his father 's orations and even more enraptured by the concept of " Hell 's Fire , " which the minister seemed to stress . On occasion , the younger Poole would find his father 's messages " so frightening until I , Myself , being his son , would tremble .... I would think and wonder , Will I live to get to Heaven before this comes ? ' " Over time , Elijah acquired a will to preach and evangelize . Moreover , he was also determined to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes discerned in the lessons of his father and other ministers . Eventually , he found himself so emboldened that Monday mornings saw theological duels between father and son , the latter armed with scriptural proof for his arguments . When possible , William avoided the youth , commenting to his wife , Mariah , " You know , that boy gets on my nerves . " While Elijah enjoyed his father 's " jackleg " preaching and the power that he projected from the chancel , he felt that something was missing from the presentations , some hidden truth that had not been made clear. ( 15 ) // Elijah 's early interest in Christian doctrine and church affairs stemmed from a sincere curiosity about God , salvation , and the place of man in both the panorama of history and the larger divine plan . Having lost some confidence in his father 's teachings , not to mention his qualifications as a minister , Elijah often pored over the Bible in solitude , looking for those gems of arcane knowledge that his father had missed the prior Sunday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made himself two promises . First , he would not become an official member of the church before the understanding that he sought was revealed to him . Second , he would never allow those he suspected of insincerely presenting themselves as believers to continue to do so without an abrasive challenge from him . // In fact , after one of his younger brothers joined the church , Elijah confronted him and taunted , " You say God told you to go and join the church ? " The younger boy answered affirmatively . Elijah replied sardonically , " Man , you ought to stop lying .... You do everything you did before you joined the church . How can you tell the preacher a lie and say you got a religion . Why did n't the religion stop you from doing the evil that you used to do ? " // At about age fourteen , Elijah did finally join the church , but not of his own volition . Apparently , he was pressured into doing so by the conformity of the other children or by his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equivocation . Even though he was now " convinced " that he should become a member of the body of Christ , Elijah found it difficult to deceive the church into believing he was saved . Unlike his younger brother , who claimed God had told him to join , Elijah , deep in his conscience , was still nagged by what he knew to be the truth : " God had not told Me anything . " ( 16 ) // During his youthful struggles with theology , Elijah did manage to acquire some education , though incomplete and brief . He attended the public school for blacks in Cordele , walking as far as five miles to get to the languishing facilities provided for the less fortunate of Crisp County . Sources disagree on when Elijah left school , perhaps as early as the fourth grade but definitely not past the eighth . Like other African-American children in Cordele , Elijah had to work at home to help with the family 's survival . For the foreseeable future , he would have to be satisfied with the rudimentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , Elijah numbered among the 25 percent of Cordele blacks who stood at the chasm of illiteracy. ( 17 ) // Elijah 's experiences as a laborer started as early as age ten , when he and one of his sisters chopped firewood and sold it for fifty cents to customers in town . The work was time-consuming , and their pay hardly compensated them for their efforts . The family , however , needed whatever hard currency it could get , including the coins earned by the children . Poverty was a constant for the Pooles regardless of whether they were in Sandersville or Cordele . During the winter months when their business prospered most , Elijah and his sister , as well as their other siblings , still knew well the face of privation . Typically , they each wore the same " rough garment for the whole season , " even when they made their periodic treks into town to sell firewood. ( 18 ) // The excursions into town not only exposed Elijah and the other children to a quasi-urban setting distinct from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of their training in the harsh school of Southern race relations . Elijah had already learned much about blacks and their history in Georgia from his parents and grandparents . On several occasions , he had sat and paid rapt attention to his grandmother 's tales of beatings that her sister had received during slavery . His grandfather shared poignant details about how religion had been used to reconcile slaves with their bondage and thus make them more manageable . During his early years , Elijah heard of systems of debt slavery and peonage that still exited throughout Georgia where whole families could not leave their white creditors ' farms for years due to unsettled accounts . Worse still were the macabre rumors that " certain rivers , lakes , and wooded wilderness-like places carry the bones and skulls of many Black slaves from these plantations in so-called freedom times . " All of these stories sickened and grieved Elijah to the point that he promised himself to do something for his people when he became a man. ( 19 ) // For a while , Elijah was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  --  the racial slurs and discrimination that he and his siblings encountered both in town and in rural areas . Most blacks , to exist within the uneasy peace of Crisp County , learned to cope with the hostile white community that dominated here . The family 's needs necessitated that all the able-bodied Poole children work and thus face white Cordele at least periodically . For Elijah , however , the necessary journeys to Cordele and its environs became over time , unsafe and outright horrifying . Some threats became commonplace and even tolerable yet other instances of intimidation , such as when a white man coolly revealed to him the severed ear of a black person were unnerving not only in themselves but also due to the level of hatred and barbarity underlying them. ( 20 ) // Few things in the history of the South set off the kind of shock waves in the black community that lynchings did . Emerging as a phenomenon during Reconstruction and lasting well into the civil rights era of the 1950s and 1960s , mob murders of African-Americans erested at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been 159 lynchings during the 1890s and as late as 1916 , when blacks began leaving the state in droves , 16 people lost their lives to vigilante violence . Tales of lynchings and indiscriminate brutality unleashed upon blacks were plentiful in south-central Georgia , but Cordele seems to have had a special reputation for midnight kidnappings and mob violence . Just three years following the Pooles arrival in Cordele , a black man was found hanging from a tree on a public road close to the city . In time , Elijah Poole came face-to-face with the worst of the South 's crimes. ( 21 ) // The unspeakable happened sometime around the winter of 1907 , when Elijah , now ten , had first begun taking firewood to Cordele for sale . As he approached the African-American section of town , he encountered a large crowd of whites . He moved closer to see what the crowd saw . There , for all who cared to see , the corpse of an eighteen-year-old black youth whom Elijah had known was " dangling from a tree limb . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a trial was seized and summarily reeled up a willow tree by the neck and riddled with bullets . Though a most savage object lesson , Elijah could not understand how this could have happen to a young man " in the midst of his own people " while " all our grown men right there in the section " watched and dared not intervene . The murder and the subdued reaction of the African-American community repulsed him and his tears flowed unencumbered . He cried for the dead youth and the rest of the blacks of Cordele , who had , in his view , allowed the killing to take place . No firewood was sold that day , and the pellucid impression of the hanging man gripped his entire consciousness as he made the four-mile trip back home. ( 22 ) // This traumatic experience stayed with Elijah for the rest of his life and certainly made him more susceptible to black separatist doctrines . For now his response was to get out of Cordele , or at least to avoid it as much as possible . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macon , Georgia , perhaps directly influenced by the lynchings of two African-American men in Cordele during 1912 . Over the next few years , he worked in a variety of occupations , from laboring in sawmills to overseeing workers at the Cherokee Brick Company , where he served as a tramroad foreman and builder . His real desire was to become a dining boy for the railroad and to achieve this goal , he sought employment with a white farmer who turned out to be little more than a relic of the antebellum South . Elijah worked " from sun to sun " to save enough money to pay for the training necessary for the railroad job . Within a six-month period , however , he found the farmwork unbearable , having seen laborers flogged at gunpoint and offered only eight dollars a month in wages . The breaking point came when the farmer threatened to beat Elijah with a six-foot staff if he did not submit to every command . Elijah warned that if he was struck , he " would have no better sense than to strike hthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up to for leadership by his siblings and others , never became used to either ceding absolute authority to others or being cursed by employers who knew he needed the job . Ordered to leave this farmer 's premises , he turned his back forever on working for white farm owners. ( 23 ) // During the second decade of the twentieth century , black life in many Georgian cities underwent a series of adjustments in response to new circumstances . Poverty , racism , lynchings , and political disfranchisement remained relatively constant , but the outbreak of Work War 1 and 1914 and the swelling demand for labor in Northern industrial centers began pulling thousands of hopeful black migrants north , African-American began leaving Georgia in a trickle that eventually resembled a flood , as ten thousand left in late 1916 , followed by at least fifty thousand more the next year . The loss of labor severely damaged Georgia 's agrarian economy , the greatest blow perhaps coming during the period between 1920 nd 1922 when over 150,000 blacks quit the Peach State . The migration continued for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 24 ) // The boll weevil , regarded by many as a plague of biblical proportions , helped many blacks to make up their minds about leaving Georgia . The infestation struck hard and extensively forcing Georgians to pay the price for depending so heavily upon a cotton monoculture . Immediately prior to the attack in 1916 . Georgia 's fields averaged 230 pounds of cotton per acre , and afterward 117 pounds . During the Great Migration , the destruction of cotton fields seemed to correlate with the departure of African-Americans from the state , with 10 percent of crops being damaged in 1918 and 40 percent by 1923 , when the migration declined temporarily . To negate the effects of the boll weevil and the demands of wartime production in Northern cities on Georgia 's demography , local governments placed restrictions on labor recruiters and intimidated blacks bent upon leaving the region . When these efforts proved largely ineffectual , politicians and editors resorted to antilynching lip service to superficially address one of the real causes of the migration . All to little avail . In a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be found in Northern and Midwestern cities , owing to the pestilence of war , boll weevils , and odious Southern traditions. ( 25 ) // Like thousands of other blacks , Elijah switched from agricultural to industrial employment just as the United States decided that armed neutrality was impossible and that participation in the war in Europe was unavoidable . In 1918 , he barely missed being among the thirty-four thousand Georgian blacks drafted for service in the conflict , the war having ended " one day before they were calling up the group that I was in . " The following year , the Southern Railroad Company hired Elijah in Macon as a gang laborer on a section of the track . The Southern , which invested millions of dollars in trackage at that time , had a reputation for hiring African-Americans as firemen and brakemen as well as common laborers . It also , like many other white-owned corporations in the South , was known for racial discrimination , as evidenced by its agreement to pay black 35 percent less than whites in order to avoid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of local whites , the Southern and other Georgian railroads employed eleven thousand African-Americans by 1925 , more than in any other state , and even met on common ground with the newly formed International Railroadmen 's Benevolent Industrial Aid Association , which organized black workers and established locals in Macon , Augusta , and Savannah . Whether Elijah ever joined the union during his four years of employment with the Southern in unknown ; however , at least in his first year on the job , much his of time was probably spent courting a woman he had met named Clara Evans , whom he married in Cordele on March 17 , 1919. ( 26 ) // Clara was born in Georgia on November 2 , 1898 . A petite woman with a deep brown complexion , she was soft-spoken and devoutly Christian , having been raised in a Holiness environment . Elijah was perhaps impressed by both her piety and her willingness to accommodate his intermittent trips between Macon and Cordele . Her companionship and comfort after long days on the railroad helped him to deal with his bouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in February 1921 , followed by Ethel in October of the next year . Elijah now had his own family and the attendant responsibilities , and the job on the railroad meant more than any other he had ever held. ( 27 ) // The predictable , though stressful , patterns of work in industrializing Georgia disillusioned Elijah less than the sporadic atrocities , which sent tremors of horror through his soul . Like others , he grieved for the victims he heard about , but learned to cope with the reality of racism and brutality that underlay Southern culture , without becoming paranoid . He learned to survive . However , firsthand knowledge of savage events always repulsed him and again , as an adult , he wa privy to the unspeakable . During a Saturday evening in 1920 or 1921 , Elijah and one of his brothers traveled to Macon on business . As they covered the nine miles from their home to the city , African-Americans leaving the area warned them of a lynching . The body of the victim had been tied to a pickup truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not turn back , and anticipating the encounter was probably as morose and disgusting as actually seeing the mangled black body . In the tragic walk past yet another crowd of sanguinary white Southerners , Elijah , indeed , saw what he had been warned about , and " returned back home with this image of lynching . " ( 28 ) // With the addition of this last graphic episode , Elijah had endured too much in Georgia to stay . The lynchings , racist employers , marginal wages , boll weevils , and other social and economic maladies all formed an equation that seemed to have only one answer . Whether Elijah 's departure from Georgia was triggered by obscene words from a railroad boss , inviting letters from relatives who had already fled the state , or some combination of influences , the burdens of race and class placed upon blacks in general were the primary causes for the Poole exodus , In April 1923 , Elijah , Clara , and their two children migrated , probably by railway , to Detroit , Michigan . They were accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at the same solution for their lives in Georgia . In the years to come , Elijah would make few trips back to the South and would have even fewer pleasant things to say about Georgia in particular . His bitterness , which was now an inherent part of his consciousness , would later be contagious and galvanize thousands of African-Americans throughout the country behind his leadership . But for the present , Elijah left the Peach State without looking back , having seen " enough of the white man 's brutality in Georgia to last me for 26,000 years . " ( 29 )
