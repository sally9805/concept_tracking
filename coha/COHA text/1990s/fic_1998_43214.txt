Of late , Bob Sheckley has been writing mostly mystery novels , including Soma Blues and Draconian New York . He 's currently finishing up a new fantasy entitled Godshome . Of course , Bob has also been entertaining us with skewed short stories for four decades now , and it 's nice to see he 's not letting up . Witness this story of a visit to a blue and white world . <p> ONE THING ABOUT PRESIDENT Rice . He was able to make up his mind . When Ong came to Earth with his contention , Rice believed him . Not that it made any difference in the end . It began when the Marine guard came into the Oval Office , his face ashen . " What is it ? " said President Rice , looking up from his papers . " Someone wants to see you , " the guard said . " So ? A lot of people want to see the President of the United States . Is his name on the morning list ? " " You do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! One moment he was n't there and the next moment , there he was , standing in front of me in the corridor . And he is n't a man , sir . He stands on two legs but he is n't a man . He 's - he 's - I do n't know what he is ! " And the guard burst into tears . Rice had seen other men cave in from the pressures of government . But what did a Marine guard have to do with pressures ? " Listen , son , " Rice said . The guard hastily rubbed tears out of his eyes . " Yes , sir . " His voice was shaky , but it was n't hysterical . " What I want you to do , " Rice said , " is take the rest of the day off . Go home . Get some rest . Come back here tomorrow refreshed . If your supervisor asks about it , tell him I ordered it . Will you do that for me ? " " Yes , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you met in the corridor . The one you say does n't look human . Do n't talk to him . Just tell him I 'm waiting to see him . " The fellow was not long in coming . He was about six feet tall . He wore a silver one-piece jump suit that shimmered when you looked at it . His features were difficult to describe . All you could say for sure was , he did n't look human . " I know what you 're thinking , " the fellow said . " You are thinking that I do n't look human . " " That 's right , " Rice said . " You 're correct . I 'm not human . Intelligent , yes . Human , no . You can call me Ong . I 'm from Omair , a planet in the constellation you call Sagittarius . Omair is a yellow and green world . Do you believe me ? " " Yes , I believe you , " Rice said . " May I ask why ? " " It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you stayed around here and submitted to an examination by a team of our scientists , they 'd conclude that you were an alien . So let 's get right to it . You 're an alien . I accept that you 're from a green and yellow world named Omair . Now what ? " " You 're asking , I suppose , why I 've come here , at this time ? " " That 's right . " " Well , sir , I 've come to warn you that your sun is going to go nova in about one hundred and fifty of your years . " " You 're sure ? " " Quite sure . " " Why 'd you wait so long to get around to telling us ? " " We just found out ourselves . As soon as it was confirmed , my people sent me as emissary to give your planet the information and offer what assistance we could . " " Why did they pick you ? " " I was chosen at random for off-planet service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you say so . " " Now I have delivered the message . How can we help ? " Rice was feeling very peculiar . He did n't understand it , but he really did believe the emissary . But he also knew his belief was futile in terms of saving Earth 's people . Ong 's contention would have to be submitted to scientific proof . Before any conclusions could be reached , the Earth would vaporize in the expanding sun . Rice knew that if he wanted to do anything about it , it would have to begin now . Rice said , " Some of our scientists have made similar conjectures as to our eventual doom . " " They 're right . Within approximately one hundred and fifty years this planet will no longer be habitable . May I be blunt ? You 're going to have to get off . All of you . And you must begin immediately . " " Great , " President Rice said . " Oh , that 's just great . " " Is something wrong ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rice put a hand to his forehead . " This is a nightmare situation . But I have to deal with it as if it 's real . Because it probably is . " He wiped his forehead again . " Let 's say I believe you . How could we do anything about it ? " " We of Omair are ready to help . We will give you detailed plans explaining what you must do to make starships for all Earth 's people . There will be further instructions for getting all the people together and into the ships in an orderly manner . Please understand , we 're just trying to help , not impose ourselves on you . " " I believe you , " Rice said , and he did . " There 's a lot to be done , " the emissary said . " It 's a big task , but you humans are just as smart as we Omairians - we checked on that , no use wasting our time on dummies . With your present level of technology , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the next hundred years . " " It 's a tremendously exciting prospect , " Rice said . " We thought you 'd feel that way . You are n't the only planetary civilization we 've been able to rescue . " " That is very much to your credit . " " Nothing to praise . This is how we Omairians are . " " I 'm going to have to ask something that may sound a little strange , " Rice said . " But this is Earth so I have to ask it . Who 's going to pay for all this ? " " If it 's necessary , " Ong said , " we of Omair are willing to defray the costs . " " Thank you . That 's very good of you . " " We know . " " So what will be necessary ? " " To begin with , you 'll need to clear out the center of one of your continents for the launching pads. - But that 's not too difficult , because you can distribute the people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . But we will supply whatever food is needed . " Rice could imagine it now - the slow convening of experts from all over the globe , the quarreling , the demands for more and more proofs . And even if a consensus of scientists came to agreement after many years , what about the population at large ? Before any sizeable portion of the Earth 's people could be convinced , the Earth would long since have vaporized in the expanding sun . " Simultaneous to the building of the starships , " the emissary went on , " you 'll have to get your populations indoctrinated , innoculated we 'll supply the medicines - and in general prepared for a long journey by starship . During the transition period you 'll require temporary housing for millions . We can help there . " " Is the indoctrination really necessary ? Earth people hate that sort of thing . " " Absolutely essential . Your people will not be prepared for a lifetime of shipboard life . Hypnotherapy may be needed in many cases . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it , being uprooted this way . But it 's either that or perish in about a hundred years . " " I 'm convinced , " Rice said . " The question is , can I sell it ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " Well , it 's not just a case of convincing me , you know . There are tens of millions of people out there who wo n't believe you . " " But surely if you order them to take the necessary measures for their own good ... " " I 'm just the ruler of one country , not the whole planet . And I ca n't even order my own countrymen to do what you 're suggesting . " " You do n't have to order it . Just suggest it and show the proofs . Humans are intelligent . They 'll acccept your view . " Rice shook his head . " Believe me , they wo n't believe me . Most of them will think this is a diabolical plot on the part of government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other . Some will think little gray aliens are trying to trick us into captivity . Others will believe it 's the work of a long-vanished Elder Race , here to do us in . Whatever the reason , everyone will be sure it 's a plot of some kind . " " A plot to do what ? " Ong asked . " To enslave us . " " We of Omair do n't do that sort of thing . We have a perfect record in that regard . I can offer proofs . " " You keep on talking about proofs , " Rice said . " But most humans are proof-proof . " " Is that really true ? . " " Sad to say , it 's true . " " It goes against accepted theory . We have always believed that intelligence invariably produces rationality . " " Not in these parts . Not with us . " " I 'm sorry to hear that . We Omairians thought this was just a matter of one colleague calling on another and warning him of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had no idea humans might resist believing . It 's not rational , you know . Are you quite sure of this ? " " That 's how humans are . And above all , they 're conditioned from earliest age against taking orders from aliens . " " I would n't be giving any orders . " " You 'd be advising the government . In people 's minds , that would be the equivalent of giving orders . " " I do n't know what to tell you , " the emissary said . " Is there really no way you could convince people otherwise ? " " I can tell you here and now , it 'll never work . " Ong gave a slight inclination of his head . " Well , it has been nice meeting you . Have a nice day . " The emissary turned to go . " Just one moment , " Rice said . The alien paused , turned . " Yes ? " " What about just taking those of us who do believe , who want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissary said . " In all our experience , races either can change their thinking and get away from their doomed worlds by their own efforts , or they can not . " " We 're different , " Rice said . " All right , " the emissary said . " I 'll do it . Gather your people . I 'll be back in ten years to take those who want to go . We ca n't wait any longer than that . " " We 'll be ready . " TEN YEARS LATER , the emissary came to a small , hand-built house in a corner of the Oregon Cascade Mountains . A trout stream ran behind the house , and Rice was standing beside the stream , fishing . Rice said , " How did you find me here ? " " Once we Omairians have met you , we can always find you again . But I think you are not president any longer . " " No , " Rice said . " My term ended and I did n't get reelected . I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly everyone thought I was a crackpot . Those who did believe me were worse than those who did n't . A crazy man tried to shoot me and killed my wife instead . My children hold me responsible . They changed their names and moved away . " " I am sorry to hear that , " the emissary said . " But I think you 'll have to admit that those other people , the ones who despise and disbelieve you , do not have your grasp , your intelligence , your intuition . You 're probably the most unusual man of your century , Mr. Rice . You believed in us from the start . You did n't think we were sent by God or the devil . You accepted what we said . Evidently you were the only one . " " Evidently . " " Perhaps it 's for the best , " the emissary said . " Your people , in their present state , could never have made it out there . But you could . " " Me ? " " Your true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galaxy . There is still time . You are not an old man . We have rejuvenation treatments . We can add many years to your life . We have women of our species who would be honored to mate with you . We have a civilization that would welcome you . I beg of you , leave this doomed Earth behind and come away with me . " " No , I think not , " Rice said . " I can still look forward to living another thirty or so years on Earth before things get too bad , ca n't I ? " " Yes , but no longer . " " It 's enough . I 'll stay . " " You choose to die here with your people ? But they will perish because of their own ignorance . " " Yes . But they are Earth 's children , as I am . My place is here with them . " " I find it difficult to believe you 're saying this . " " I did a lot of thinking about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other humans . Not fundamentally . And certainly no better . " " I ca n't accept that . Anyhow , what is your inference ? " " It seemed to me that if my species was incapable of believing in its own doom , it was not for me to believe in it , either . So I 've decided that all that stuff you talked about is not going to happen . In fact , I 'm pretty sure I 've dreamed all this up . " " It is not intelligence , " said the emissary , " to take refuge in solipsism . " " My mind 's made up . I 'll stay here with my trout stream . You 've never done any fly fishing , have you , emissary ? " " Where I come from , " the emissary said , " we do n't fish . We respect all life . " " Does that mean you do n't eat flesh of any kind ? " " That is correct . " " What about vegetables ? They 're living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . We convert our energy from inert chemicals , or , if necessary , we transform it directly from solar radiation . We can re-engineer you so you can do that , too . " " I 'll just bet you can , " Rice said . " I beg your pardon ? " " You heard me . Or rather , you heard my implication . The sort of life you offer would n't be human . It would be hellish . It would n't be worth living for a fellow like me , to say nothing of my friends . I refer to the rest of the human race . " " You mentioned hell . There is no hell . " " Yes there is . Hell is me talking to you . Now do me a favor and get out of my face . " The emissary left , and , outside , paused for a moment , looking back at the house . Would Rice change his mind ? No indication of it . Ong shrugged and returned to his vehicle . With a gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon he was high in the air , with the green and blue planet receding below him . Soon he would put in the faster than light drive . But just before he did , he turned back and took a last look . A goodlooking planet , and intelligent people . A pity to see it all lost . He brooded for a moment , but only a moment . Then he consoled himself with the knowledge that this represented no real loss to the Cosmos . After all , intelligent life had evolved again and again on planets all over the universe . But what had evolved was intelligent life much like that of Ong and his people . That was the standard , the norm . But intelligent life like Earth 's ? Intelligent irrational life ? It had to be a fluke , a one-of-a-kind thing , this mating of intelligence and irrationality . The emissary did n't think the universe had seen Earth 's like before . It probably would not again . He looked down once more at the Earth . It looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more where that came from . Sort of . In any event , it was time to get back to his own green and yellow world . <p>
