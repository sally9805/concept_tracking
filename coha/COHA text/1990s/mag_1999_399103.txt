Healthy Treats Your Pets Will Love <p> Occasional indulgences make life more fun-for both of you <p> Delicious food is one of life 's great pleasures-not just for us humans , but also for our cat and dog companions . However , even as the holiday season seems to give us permission to indulge ourselves , many of us still feed our pets nothing more than their regular , dry , year-round food . Imagine eating the same dry meal day after day . No variety-what a bore ! <p> Since a well-balanced pet food supplies all the nutrients that they need , it 's easy to imagine that anything else would spoil our pet or even impact his health . But is it necessary to be so strict ? No . The truth is , as long as your pet has no special health or diet restrictions , treats are fine in moderation . In fact , when I conducted an informal poll of some of my colleagues , I discovered plenty of veterinarians and pet experts who routinely treat their pets with everything from standard dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can Share <p> You may have heard that human foods are bad for pets , but our food can be as good-or as bad-for pets as it is for us , says Kim Campbell Thornton , author of more than 15 books on pets , including Dog Treats ( Doubleday , 1997 ) and Cat Treats ( Doubleday , 1997 ) . A caveat : If your pet eats too much of a food that he 's not used to , it can lead to vomiting , diarrhea , or even more serious digestive complications . Start small by giving these foods a try as treats : Fruits . Thornton treats her dogs with oranges . Grapes too-dogs love to play with them and then eat them . Many dogs like apples and even bananas . ( My father , who used to eat a banana every night for the potassium , always shared it with our little Westie . ) Some cats like fruit too-my cat Eddie , for some unfathomable reason , just adores cantaloupe . Vegetables . Thornton 's dogs also love noshing on raw carrots , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats seem to love " delicacies " such as canned tomato sauce or even fresh corn-including my Eddie , who enjoys chewing kernels right off the cob ! Chips or cereal . Like their human counterparts , most pets love salty or crunchy foods . Some cats like potato chips and corn chips , while some enjoy Cheerios as a treat . Warning : Some prepared foods are high in sodium and can be harmful if your pet has heart disease or high blood pressure . Check the label and consult your veterinarian . Hot dogs . Although it 's a good idea for both you and your pet to avoid heavily processed , high-fat foods , a hot dog now and again probably wo n't hurt . As a healthier alternative , many of the vets I spoke to said that they use turkey dogs or meatless hot dogs ; they 're generally lower in fat , sodium , and unhealthy preservatives than the beef variety . Whichever type you choose , you can make hot-dog treats for your pet simply by cutting a hot dog into 1/4-inch slices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a little crispy . ( You can also slow-cook them in the oven at 250 degrees F for 30 minutes or until they are firm to the touch . ) For Their Mouth Only <p> If you prefer to fill your pet 's Christmas stocking with standard treats designed just for him , that 's fine too . Here are some of the goodies that my colleagues recommend : Biscuits . Sometimes the traditional treat is the best treat . Thornton gives these to her dogs , but prefers those that do n't contain unnecessary preservatives and colorings . Freeze-dried liver treats . You 'll find these in most pet food stores . Meat rolls . These meat-based treats are packaged like salami . Dogs find them really delicious . Look at the label : Some brands are supplemented with vitamins and do n't contain chemicals or dyes . Quick Tip <p> Treats should never make up more than 5 to 10% of your pet 's diet . The rest should be a nutritionally balanced diet , which your pet will get from most commercial dog and cat foods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal-behavior counselor ; she 's also a professionally trained chef who loves to cook for her two poodles , Ginger and Mikey . Her favorite recipe : Chicken Liver Brownies . I tried them . They 're easy to make and a great treat for dogs . ( For a variation your cat can enjoy too , substitute a 12-ounce can of salmon for the chicken livers . ) TABLE <p> Grind the chicken livers in a blender or a food processor . Combine with the other ingredients and mix with a spoon . Coat a 13 " x 9 " pan with nonstick spray . Fill with the mixture . Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until it 's firm to the touch . Cool . Cut into bite-size squares and store them in the refrigerator or freezer . For firmer treats , return the squares to a low-heat oven for an additional 1 to 1 1/2 hours until crispy . <p> Note : Do n't substitute onion or onion seasoning for other ingredients ; it can cause serious digestive problems for your pet . <p> Prabhakar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The price per pound of packaged preservatives or colorings . She finds it much less expensive to buy a piece of beef roast on sale for $1.49 per pound . She cooks it , lets it cool , then cuts it into bite-size pieces . Those go into plastic bags and then into the freezer . Do n't Treat from the Table <p> Feeding from the table almost always leads to begging at the table . Instead , place treats in your pet 's food dish after your meal or use the treats for training . They 're a great way to teach those all-important commands : " Sit , " " Down , " " Stay , " and " Come . " Even cats can learn these behaviors-with patience and plenty of treats . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Come and get it ! Well-planned snacks will add spice to his life <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Tie treats to correctly obeying commands such as " sit " and " Stay " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Amy Marder , VMD <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine and vice president of Behavioral Medicine and Companion Animal Services at the ASPCA Headquarters in New York City <p>
