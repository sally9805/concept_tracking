<p> Know why sharks do n't bite lawyers ? Professional courtesy . <p> Know why the California State Bar came out last year against sex between attorneys and their clients ? They did n't want the clients to be double-billed for essentially the same service . <p> Know why the California State Bar president wants to end lawyer jokes ? He thinks they 're a hate crime . <p> That last is no joke . It just sounds like one . <p> California bar president Harvey Saferstein , speaking out after a recent mass shooting in a San Francisco law office , really did call for a " cease-fire " on lawyer jokes , comparing them in seriousness to hate speech against racial minorities and saying they contribute to a climate of violence against lawyers . <p> Saferstein was responding to the July 1 rampage in which a gunman killed eight people , including three attorneys , in the law office before turning the gun on himself . <p> It is easy to sympathize with Saferstein 's intent to reduce violence , but there must be better ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other professional group , for that matter - as hate crime victims . <p> Who next ? Journalists ? Surely the public would revolt at that . <p> Hard as it is to find groups at whom one can poke fun in these hypersensitive times , lawyers are too vulnerable for their own good . Although many work with great courage and dedication for long hours and small compensation , the experience most Americans have with lawyers tends to be expensive and about as pleasant as a root canal . <p> If anything , lawyer jokes may be an important emotional safety valve for public frustration over the fear , pain and loathing generated by an often sluggish and unresponsive legal system . <p> LOS ANGELES TIMES A booster shot for kids <p> While comprehensive national health-care reform may eventually include an immunization program , there 's no need for American children to wait . Unlike overhauling the health-care system , the issue is not complicated . Everyone knows immunization works , and there 's no reason it ca n't be made available to every needy and uninsured child in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill passed by the House would provide immunizations for 11.1 million children , including 4.6 million additional children , according to the Children 's Defense Fund . Both poor and uninsured children would have access to free vaccinations . <p> Further changes may be necessary to ensure that children whose families can afford vaccinations - but whose medical insurance does not pay for vaccinations - do n't get subsidized . <p> Even so , the House version essentially has it right . The nation must not delay in protecting its children from preventable deadly diseases . <p> THE BALTIMORE SUN Flood insurance at flood tide <p> The problem with flood insurance is both that too many homes have it and that too few do . Estimates of the number of uninsured structures in risky flood areas along rivers and the coasts vary , but at most , it appears , only about one-fourth of all at-risk structures are insured . That is why Congress will soon be asked to bail out uninsured homeowners in the Middle West . But lucky for Congress there are not more policy- holders . The insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeowners that the fund is in no way able to pay off the claims in a bad year . <p> And 1993 is a bad year . <p> Rep. Douglas Bereuter ( R-Neb. ) is the author of legislation aimed at bringing s ome logic and common sense to the flood insurance program . He would make lenders require flood insurance of threatened properties . He would raise premiums to reflect true risk . He would put an end to repetitive claims in high-risk flood zones . It is good legislation that deserves to become law . Some people are willing to take the risk involved in living on the seacoast or lakefront or river 's edge . They should not be denied that right . But they , not other taxpayers , should have to pay for the resultant damages when the waters rise . <p> WASHINGTON POST Mississippi flood <p> The stories on the nightly news and in the papers will never quite do justice to a natural disaster such as that now befalling the upper Midwest . <p> You have to imagine yourself returning to your own neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water for a period of time , the awful chores of trying to salvage goods and belongings , the mucking out , the months and cost of rebuilding , not to get ahead but just to get back to wherever you happened to be for better or worse before the disaster struck . <p> Multiply that by an entire region , or at least the parts of it along the banks of the upper Mississippi and its affected tributaries , and you get a sense of the loss . <p> ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER Soaking the rich . . . again <p> More revenue , that 's rich ! <p> Could it be that Bill Clinton is really a secret libertarian or small-government conservative who wants to starve government down to size ? Of course he 's not , but you might not know it from his tax-increase mania . Fact is , the higher income taxes and other levies he 's foisting on the country are likely to depress revenue severely , increasing the deficit - but also decreasing the amount of dollars all those Clintonite social engineers have to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old George Bush saddled us with had just this depressing effect on revenue contributed from the groups it targeted . <p> It was the rich - defined as those making more than $ 200,000 yearly - that were the top targets of higher income-tax rates under the Bush plan , but the latest numbers from the Treasury Department indicate that 1991 tax receipts from these folks fell by $ 6.5 billion , or 6.1 percent . In other words , people respond to higher taxes by working less or finding other ways to avoid the stiffer hits . <p> ORLANDO SENTINEL Protection from politics <p> U.S. Senate will be treading on dangerous ground this week when it considers a measure that would repeal key sections of the Hatch Act , which strictly limits federal civil-service workers ' involvement in political activity . <p> The changes being proposed by Sen. John Glenn ( D-Ohio ) , would allow off-duty federal rank-and-file employees to manage political campaigns , hold office in political parties and register voters on behalf of a political party . <p> The Hatch Act was put into place in 1939 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government administration . What 's more , it has shielded government workers from overt or subtle coercion to protect their jobs . <p> There are enough problems in the federal government as it is . The last thing we need is to have rank-and-file workers divided into political camps . The measure should be defeated .
