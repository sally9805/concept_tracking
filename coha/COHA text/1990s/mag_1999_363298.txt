Recently , during one of our regular Sunday dinners , my mother complained of some aches and pains . She asked me my opinion , and like any good doctor , I replied , " When did you have your last complete physical and blood tests ? " The time it took for her to remember was answer enough . Not only had it been too long , but she had n't been given basic blood tests that most women should have on a periodic basis . So when the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists revised its screening recommendations for women two weeks ago , I immediately sent a copy to my mom . <P> ACOG is a professional group representing more than 40,000 physicians involved in women 's care . It issues periodic recommendations , based on a patient 's age and risk factors , on what types of screening , evaluation and counseling should be part of a woman 's routine exams . The new recommendations replace a set issued two years ago . <P> One of the major changes to the list is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hepatitis-A vaccine is being recommended for groups at high risk for the disease , including international travelers , drug users and workers in the food-service , health-care or day-care industry . The test for hepatitis-C virus has been added for all women 13 and older and for women at particularly high risk ( women who take intravenous drugs and those who received an organ transplant or a blood transfusion before 1992 ) . <P> Diabetes testing is another major change . A glucose test is now recommended every three years for all women over age 45  --  not just for those known to be at high risk for diabetes . ACOG also changed its definition of high risk , expanding it to include women in ethnic groups that are disproportionately vulnerable : African Americans , Hispanics and Native Americans . <P> The HIV high-risk group was expanded as well . In addition to tests for pregnant women , ACOG now recommends HIV tests for all women seeking preconception care and any woman with invasive cervical cancer , regardless of age . <P> The recommendations also addressed the scope of the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 19 , for example , should be asked if they have any bladder- or bowel-control problems . While these problems are not very common in younger women , the question is easy enough to ask , and if there is a problem , early intervention could make life a lot more comfortable . <P> For low-risk women in their 40s , ACOG still recommends a mammogram every one to two years and annually after age 50 . However , a study released last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association brings into question the use of mammography in women after age 69 . Researchers studied 10,000 women to try to determine whether annual mammograms provided enough benefit to warrant their use . The results showed , rather dramatically , that the gains in life expectancy for these elderly women were minimal . With some variation depending on the sample , only 1 death per 10,000 women is likely to be avoided . <P> With her copy of these new recommendations , and a list of key questions to put to her doctor , my mother will certainly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> For more on the guidelines , visit ACOG 's website at
