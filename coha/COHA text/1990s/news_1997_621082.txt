<p> California 's system for tracking the deaths of the developmentally disabled is so unreliable that the state has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to care for people who have been dead for months or even years , The Chronicle has learned . <p> Hundreds of deaths in 1994 and 1995 were reported weeks or months late to the state by the 21 private , tax-funded regional centers for the developmentally disabled , according to confidential reports prepared by Governor Pete Wilson 's Department of Developmental Services . In some cases , sources said , the deaths were not reported at all . <p> With caseloads inflated by dead clients , the regional center system may have collected more than $ 1 million from the state in just those two years for staff and expenses needed to oversee care for Californians with mental retardation , autism and cerebral palsy . <p> More broadly , critics say , the department 's confusion over the number of deaths reflects a fundamental breakdown in the state 's ability to track the health , progress and even the whereabouts of 140,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year in aid . <p> " This is not only a commentary on mortality among our clients , but on how well the regional centers are doing their jobs and on how well we are overseeing their performance , " said a Department of Developmental Services source who asked to remain anonymous . " And even if it 's not an intentional effort ( by the regional centers ) to bilk the taxpayers , the effect is the same . " <p> Each center uses state and federal funds to purchase housing , medical care , education and other services for the disabled in a specific region . The system has been in disarray in recent years , with a number of the agencies accused of mismanagement , financial abuses and a lack of accountability . <p> One department analysis of deaths among the developmentally disabled obtained by The Chronicle found that in 1994 , regional centers failed to report the deaths of 442 clients  --  an undercount of more than 30 percent . In 1995 , 571 deaths apparently went unreported  --  an undercount of nearly 40 percent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrepancy of 125 deaths in 1994 and 237 deaths in 1995 . <p> ' PHANTOM CLIENTS ' <p> Department Director Dennis G. Amundson and other top executives declined to be interviewed . But in written response to questions submitted by The Chronicle , they suggested that the reports were preliminary and that neither is accurate . They insisted that the undercount of deaths is a minor problem that has no significant effect on budgets or client-tracking . <p> The department " has no reason to believe that regional centers intentionally under-report mortality , " said Deputy Director Douglas G. Arnold . " While there is some late reporting . . . this does not occur very frequently and does not interfere with the DDS ' ability to ascertain trends in mortality . " <p> Others , however , say the problem with " phantom clients " has long been known to the department , and that the findings for 1994 and 1995 would extend to other years as well . <p> In a July 1995 internal memo obtained by The Chronicle , department Assistant Director Roberta Marlowe made it clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regional centers . <p> " DDS ' data on whether a person died is accurate in the ( state hospitals ) , " she wrote , but " much less so " for the regional centers , " where there is no incentive to indicate that a person has died because we stop paying them for dead individuals . " <p> STRUGGLING TO TRACK DEATHS <p> Questions about the department 's ability to track client deaths have taken on new urgency in recent years as the Wilson administration has rushed to transfer state hospital residents , many of them severely disabled , into community homes overseen by the state and the regional centers . <p> Medical researchers based at the University of California at Riverside have discovered that death rates escalated dramatically among nearly 2,000 who were transferred between April 1993 and the end of 1995 . <p> The department heard medical researchers ' preliminary reports of the higher death rates in community homes as early as 1994 , but disputed the findings and sought to discredit the researchers . And although Amundson conceded in February that the findings appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to attack the credibility of the reports . <p> But Amundson 's department has struggled to track deaths on its own . <p> An early study sought to count deaths in 1994 and 1995 at the six main types of residences used by the developmentally disabled , from their own family homes to community group homes to hospital-like developmental centers . <p> The discrepancies emerged when the department compared its master file of developmentally disabled clients , a list updated with information from the regional centers and the state hospitals , to the official state death list drawn from coroners ' reports to the California Bureau of Vital Statistics . <p> UNDERREPORTING DOWNPLAYED <p> While hundreds of clients in the master file were registered as living , the bureau listed them as dead . <p> Still , Arnold downplayed the problem . <p> Deaths may be reported late to the regional center by families of the disabled , he said , or for mildly disabled people who are not closely monitored . But that , he contends , is outside the centers ' control . <p> The Association of Regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Director Robert Baldo , " I assume it 's because there are problems sometimes in terms of how that information was recorded and how timely it was done . " <p> Baldo " categorically " denied that centers conceal deaths to inflate their budgets . <p> And while Roberta Marlowe 's memo said regional centers had financial incentives to withhold death reports , Arnold directly contradicted his colleague , saying the centers have no such incentive . <p> The centers " would benefit from under-reporting only by the marginal impact on their staffing standards , " he said , " and the impact of a few individuals out of 140,000 persons is negligible . " <p> Arnold declined to be more specific about the financial impact . But department budget documents make it clear that a few hundred extra clients would bring regional centers significantly more money . <p> A conservative estimate , based on the department 's budget formulae , shows that 237 unreported deaths in 1995 could have been worth more than $ 1 million to the regional centers . <p> ' THE LAZARUS SYNDROME ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undercount of deaths results from erratic record- keeping by the department and the regional centers . <p> One source familiar with department operations said that months after Stockton Developmental Center closed in 1995 , the state 's computerized client file showed more than 100 disabled people still living there . <p> The roster also includes dozens of clients that regional centers have classified as dead one year and alive the next , a phenomenon that the source calls " the Lazarus Syndrome . " Some have died twice  --  and come alive again both times . <p> In other cases , the undercounting seems to result from simple bureaucratic inattention . <p> Carol J. Ferreira , the administrator of Community Continuum College for the disabled in Turlock , cites the case of a 22-year-old retarded man who had been enrolled in her program . <p> He died of natural causes on Nov. 2 , 1995 . But , Ferreira says , the Stockton-based Valley Mountain Regional Center left him on its computerized monthly billing invoice for almost two years  --  until July 1  --  even though she had promptly informed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine that being anything more than a very rare occurrence , " said Valley Mountain Director Richard Jacobs . " I 'm always notified when a client dies , and we have fairly rigorous . . . reporting that would result in our fiscal department knowing within a few days that a consumer has passed away . " <p> But Ferreira said it happens regularly . One worrisome result , she said , is that unscrupulous vendors could have billed the regional center for services provided to that dead client , and the regional center might never have known . <p> OVERBURDENED WITH CASES <p> That 's apparently what happened in one Los Angeles-area case . <p> Sources familiar with the case say that a 45-year-old man who was living in a group home for people with severe developmental disabilities died in January 1994 . In the 16 months after he died , a company billed the South Central Los Angeles Regional Center more than $ 3,500 for local transportation services provided to the dead man . <p> Francesca Tucker , administrator of the South Central agency , said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is under way , she said . <p> At a different regional center , one case manager admitted that his colleagues are partly to blame for late death reports . The explanation : Typically , case managers have the near-impossible task of overseeing programs and services for 80 or more disabled clients , but the workload is more manageable if some of those clients are dead . <p> " Reporting deaths is a low priority , " the case manager said , " because it means you 're immediately going to get another case and overburden yourself even more . You 'd much rather do what you can for the people who are alive . " CHART : .
