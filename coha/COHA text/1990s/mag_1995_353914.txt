THE PRIZE UP FOR GRABS , TED Turner 's cable empire , was so enviable that two of America 's most fearsome bosses tried to make pre-emptive bids for it . Both made their proposals in secret . First came General Electric 's Jack Welch , who pitched a dramatic cost-cutting plan . Then , at almost the last minute , came Fox chief Rupert Murdoch , who offered Turner the chance to write his own ticket . <P> The courting finally produced a winner last week when the most ardent suitor , Time Warner , prevailed after five weeks of dealmaking . But not before two simultaneous and highly contentious board meetings took place in New York City , one at Time Warner headquarters , the other at Turner 's law firm , each ending quite differently  --  one in shouts , the other in murmurs . <P> The board of Time Warner convened on the 29th floor of the company 's headquarters in Rockefeller Center , attended not only by the directors but , according to board member Henry Luce III , by " uncountable lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Luce , " very much was taking the initiative . There were many questions , incredibly difficult technical points . " He admits , " It was n't clear , at least to me , at the beginning of the meeting that the transaction would be approved . " <P> The director asking the tough questions was Donald Perkins , former chairman of the Jewel food store company , who insisted that outside directors hire their own lawyer to help protect them against potential shareholder lawsuits . That irritated Levin , who seemed to feel that the outside directors were exhaustively scrutinizing his presentation of the facts , according to a board member . The biggest issue for Perkins was the uncertain influence of cable king John Malone , whose 21% holding in Turner Broadcasting would be converted via a complex structure to a nearly 9% stake in Time Warner . The discussions went on over three days , at times breaking into separate groups of inside and independent directors to discuss the minutiae of power and control . At the end , all 15 directors murmured either " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ceremony , they adjourned . Says Luce : " We had nothing further to say to each other . " <P> The Turner Broadcasting board meeting , across town in the offices of the company 's law firm , Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher &; Flom , was anything but calm . " It was full of drama , " says Robert Shaye , chairman of New Line Cinema and a member of the board . " The kind of stuff , " he adds , " that good boardroom TV movies are made of . " At one point , Brian Roberts of Comcast Corp . and Timothy Neher of Continental Cablevision , both directors of Turner with stakes in the company , walked out of the talks because they felt they did n't have the leverage to get the same kind of concessions in the deal as their competitor Malone . " After a lot of soul searching and caucusing , they determined that they were too conflicted to actually take part , " says one of their colleagues . No , it was not true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their departure , " but they were n't wasting any time in leaving . "
