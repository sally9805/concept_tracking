Eleven days after a Cambridge , Mass. , jury found British au pair Louise Woodward guilty of second-degree murder in the death of eight-month-old Matthew Eappen last February , Judge Hiller Zobel turned the verdict on its head . In a rare and controversial act of judicial veto , he reduced her conviction to involuntary manslaughter and deemed that the 279 days she had served in prison would suffice as a sentence . Woodward was free . The decision elated her supporters  --  among them the entire village of Elton , England , her hometown  --  and devastated Matthew 's parents , Deborah and Sunil Eappen . On Friday , Deborah Eappen emerged from seclusion to speak to TIME 's Terry McCarthy : <P> TIME : What are your feelings about the judge 's ruling ? <P> Eappen : Right now I am very stunned . I ca n't even process what happened in the last two weeks , in the last nine months . Right now my biggest concern is getting through the day , focusing on Brendan her other child and Sunil her husband . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we have been going from place to place , living out of a car , scrambling for clothes . It is hard to know what 's important . I feel I 'm the judge 's victim . Louise took away Matthew , and the judge took away justice . What are we telling people in this case ? That if you commit a crime and lie , you get away with it ? It really belittles and diminishes the value of Matthew 's life . Is this a society that views children as dispensable ? Children of abuse can not take the stand , so who is going to speak for them ? I was brought up to believe that there is right and wrong , that there are actions and consequences . <P> TIME : Do you think the judge was affected by the publicity ? <P> Eappen : The judge was not sequestered . He was reading papers ; he 's on the Internet . There is some ego thing going on there  --  you have to wonder what his underlying biases are . He showed a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you feel about the negative press coverage of you ? <P> Eappen : I do n't think anyone knew the Deborah Eappen they were talking about . People did n't care to find out what I was like ; they did n't know who I really was . People are projecting their own guilt and fears onto me . Who can you feel safe to leave your kids with ? You can not trust the people you trust  --  the day-care attendants , the teachers , the summer-camp minders . It is a reaction that protects them from the fear of something happening to their own kids . We felt it was the best thing to have someone in our house where we could control the environment , where we knew the person , knew her family , knew her friends . <P> TIME : But in the end you did n't really know her . <P> Eappen : Right . In the end she pulled a big one over us , and I feel like she 's done it to the American public and maybe to the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to deal with  --  that someone could be abusive intentionally and , above all , to a baby . You can give excuses for this behavior , but it is still murder . No one can imagine what she was thinking  --  I wish I could understand it . It is nothing a normal person would do . And it was not a one-time event . She is also responsible for his broken arm . It makes me wonder what else she did to him that did n't leave a mark . This was no accident  --  a baby who is not ambulatory , who is not walking  --  there 's no other way for him to break an arm .
