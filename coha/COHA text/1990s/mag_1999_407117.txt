On a wooden hilltop in Arkansas , Nancy Porter has gardened for 27 years , creating a breathtaking garden that surrounds her New England style home Photograph Photograph // Last spring I saw a little bit of New England in Arkansas . Right outside of Little Rock , Nancy Gunn Porter built her dream home . The house is a 1730s-style New England saltbox with simple design and classic detailing around the front door . After the house was complete , it was time to create a garden to soften the wooden structure . Nancy 's showy garden connects the house to the land and is encircled with a tidy picket fence . But , the first hole she dug-some 27 years ago-made her wonder if she would need a jackhammer . There was only a thin layer of soil covering the rocky hillside . She had to remove all the rocks from the flowerbeds and replace them with loads of compost , working the soil to make it loose , fertile , and inviting to plants . Pine straw makes cushiony soft pathways leading to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants selected to make sure they were being grown in the 1730s . She tried to match the plants , including old roses , foxglove , larkspur , and hollyhock , with the colonial era . After a few years she found this too limiting so she began to try other plants . With all the experimenting Nancy has learned what works for her , but each year the garden changes a little because there are always new plants to try . She has a great sense of design , but she also lets Mother Nature assist . Sprinkles of poppies come up here and there and reseed themselves each year . Seedlings sprout wherever seeds fall , making the garden look loose and natural . The garden has matured nicely over the quarter century . Roses climb and spill over fences and arbors . Peonies have formed thick clumps and produce pink golf ball-size buds that unfurl and transform into bowl-size blooms . Nancy carefully stakes each clump with round metal plant supports to help hold the hefty flowers up during spring rains .

Dianthus and verbena grow close to the ground and make a floral carpet by the front door . The spring garden is a welcome sight after a cold winter , but each season is special . In the summer , towering hollyhocks frame the front door . Butterflies flock to buddleia , white phlox , cosmos , and Verbena bonariensis . In the fall , sugar maples Nancy planted years ago rain golden leaves on the garden . Purple asters and Mexican bush sage supply late-season flowers . The winter garden is n't showy , but it allows you to see its framework . Winter is also a great time for Nancy to regroup and select new plants for the upcoming year . Fallen leaves are collected , ground up , and used to mulch the beds . On top of this rocky ridge in Arkansas , a dream home was built and around it a dream garden was created .
