The Delicate Fabric of Headnote the World 's Coastal Regions Is Being Torn Apart // Rachel Carson , best known for exposing the dangers of DDT in he.classic Silent Spring , was also a keen observer of our coasts . " The shore is all ancient world , for as long as there has been an Earth and sea , there has been an Earth and sea , there has been this place of the meeting of land and water , " she wrote in her 1955 book , The. ; Edge of the Sea . In principle , millions of us feel similarly . Some twothirds of the Earth 's population now live within : 50 miles of the sea ; nine of the world 's 10 largest cities are in coastal zones . U.S. coasts support a third of our national employment-more than 28 million jobs . At the same time , about two-thirds of all the fish caught for our consumption spend their early lives in ecosystems where ocean meets land . In America , commercial and recreational fishing in near-shore waters is a $65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " intricate fabric of life " is being devastated by human activities . The onslaught is hydra-headed : pollution from industrial and household wastes and agricultural run-off ; massive fish die-offs caused bv oil spills and the cooling-water intakes of electrical plants ; di- s versions of freshwater from dams ; global warming and ozone layer depletion . The tragic fact is , coastal habitat is disintegrating at a rate unprecedented in recorded history . " Some of the pollution issues are reversible , " says Ken Hinman of the National Coalition for Marine Conservation . " There are a lot of examples where we 've been able to clean up and restore waterways . The ocean is resilient enough to come back . But the biggest threats are the irreversible changes to the coastline-the filling of wetlands and destruction of barrier islands . How do we reverse the tide of development ? " To get a clearer picture of how urgent this situation is , let 's take a look back at the events of 1997 : CORAL REEFS * Nearly one-third of the Earth 's fish species live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles in tropical and subtropical regions . In Asia , the overwhelming majority of species lives on or near reefs , which coastal fishermen rely upon to feed their families . Besides providing shelter and breeding areas , reefs also serve to protect coastlines from storm damage and beach erosion . According to a global study by Australia 's Institute of Marine Science in 1992 , 10 percent had already degraded " beyond recognition , " another 30 percent were in " critical condition , " and yet another 30 percent were likely to disappear altogether within the next several decades . Since that report came out , things have taken an abrupt turn for the worse . Between last January and August , " rapid wasting disease " wiped out huge patches of coral in a 2,000-mile swath ranging from Mexico to the Caribbean . As far away as the Philippines , reefs were being struck by a variety of diseases not seen before . " The problems are occurring at all depths , and the number of species affected is increasing , " says Dr. James Porter , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mysterious epidemic labeled " white pox . " The outbreak was observed last February in the waters off Key West , Florida , along the only living coral reef in the continental U.S. In some areas , it appears to have eliminated 80 percent of the marine animals . And this is only the latest malady to strike there , following in the wake of " black band " and " white plague II . " And there are no sewage treatment plants in the Florida Keys . According to many scientists , the likely cause of the reef 's woes is nutrient pollution from thousands of septic tanks and the untreated outflows from dozens of hotels and resorts . WETLANDS * Both the Bush and Clinton Administrations have declared policies of " no net loss " of wetlands , the vital coastal areas utilized by fish , birds and other wildlife . Wetlands not only filter contaminants from the water , but provide sponge-like storage for heavy rains that could otherwise cause damaging floods . Over the years , more than half of the wetlands that existed during colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for development ; that includes 90 percent of California 's original five million acres . Last September , in the first comprehensive survey since 1990 , the U.S. Fish &Wildlife; Service announced that over one million additional acres of wetlands vanished between 1985 and 1995 . That 's about five percent of the 50 million acres remaining . The losses were especially heavy around agricultural land , which Environmental Defense Fund specialist Tim Searchinger termed " unexpected , shocking and very disturbing . " Meanwhile , a congressional bill introduced by the Republicans would change the definition of wetlands-exempting many agricultural , oil , gas and timber projects from stricter protective regulations . SHRIMP FORMS * After canned tuna , shrimp ranks as our favorite seafood . The average American consumes about 2.5 pounds a year , one pound higher than 20 years ago . Domestic harvesting of wild shrimp remains a $5 billion , 200-millionpounds-a-year industry , but is unable to keep up with the demand . So imports for processing have soared to more than 600 million pounds annually , primarily coming from shrimp aquaculture facilities in Asia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boom in the harbor at Halifax , Nova Scotia . // But shrimp from those overseas operations are transporting something else-exotic viruses , causing what the National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) calls " catastrophic " losses at U.S. shrimp farm/processing facilities along the Gulf and South Atlantic coastlines . These viruses are not harmful to humans but , as an NMFS report warned in the summer of 1997 : " These outbreaks have raised concerns that viruses could spread from aquaculture facilities to the wild shrimp stocks in U.S. coastal waters with potentially serious implications . " NMFS went on to describe the 1987 collapse of the Pacific blue shrimp fishery in the Gulf of California , after wild stocks became infected with a virus known as IHHN . Commercial harvesting had to be stopped for six years . The virus had arrived in an imported shipment of post-larval Pacific white shrimp from Asia . Since then , new outbreaks-particularly the Taura virus , which was first confirmed in 1992 in an Ecuadorian river of that namehave plagued shrimp farms in Texas , Louisiana and South Carolina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild shrimp by discharges of wastes or sediments from the farm ponds . Back at the source , the boom in shrimp aquaculture in developing nations like Thailand has wrought havoc on the mangrove forests that once lined nearly three-quarters of the world 's tropical shorelines . For centuries , mangroves have been essential in sustaining food chains and stabilizing coastal lands . In Thailand , now the world 's leading exporter of seafood , thousands of miles of coastline have been saturated with pollutants as shrimp farmers simply leave behind one pond for another . REDTIDES AND THE " CELL FROM HELL ' ' * Scientists term them " HABs , " short for Harmful Algal Blooms , the growth and accumulation of microscopic marine plants that cause " red tides . " These blooms are extremely toxic , both to the marine life feeding upon them and to people who eat contaminated shellfish . Over the past decade , the number of such singlecelled algal species has soared from 22 to 55 around the globe . Outbreaks once found only around certain coastal areas of Europe and the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is naturally occurring , as ocean currents deposit seed populations . But algal species are also transferred by the ballast water from ships , and appear to flourish when pollutants add excessive nutrients to the water . " Red tide off Florida 's West Coast comes back nearly every year , " says scientific expert Donald Anderson of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution . " Large expanses of coastline are closed because of toxins in shellfish . It 's eliminated 10 percent of the endangered manatee population , driven countless tourists from beaches , and killed millions of fish . " Last September , Texas imposed a nearly statewide ban on harvesting oysters , clams and mussels after a red tide killed millions of small fish . Around the same time , panic ensued when a microbe , Pfiesteria piscicida , appeared in several rivers of the Chesapeake Bay system in Maryland and Virginia . Not only did the socalled " cell from hell " kill thousands of menhaden bait-fish , it caused severe rashes , flu-like symptoms , and even memory loss in humans who came into contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry in Eastpoint , Florida . // Pfiesteria was first detected by North Carolina botanist JoAnn Burkholder in 1988 , after mysterious fish kills occurred in local rivers . Burkholder found that the organism thrived in highgrowth population areas , correlating to phosphate levels around sewage outfall pipes . Since then , run-off from hog and chicken farms has been identified as another probable cause . According to the Washington-based Coast Alliance , " Fertilizer and manure , along with more than a billion tons of eroded soil , run off farm fields into coastal waters every year . Almost 30 million pounds of pesticides are annually applied in areas that drain into the nation 's coasts . " FOREIGN INVADERS * Consider the Asian clam , which probably arrived in San Francisco Bay in the bilge or attached to the hull of a foreign ship . Since it was first observed here in 1986 , the Asian clam has become the dominant bottom-feeding shellfish in the bay . It is also feasted upon by ducks , sturgeon , crabs and other species . The trouble is , the Asian clam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997 , a study released by the U. S. Geological Survey showed concentrations of selenium in Asian clams to be two to three times higher than in native clam species . Back in the mid1980s , selenium discharged from six oil refineries bordering the bay killed or deformed thousands of birds . Now , higher-than-anticipated selenium levels have been found in two species of diving ducks , and reproductive problems are being noticed in ducks migrating from the bay region to Alaska . EL NINO AND GLOBIL WARMING * Generally , when scientists forecast the ominous future probabilities from greenhouse gases heating up our atmosphere , the coastal focus is on rising sea levels and more intense hurricanes . These are indeed very real threats : If sea levels rise by two feet , as the Clinton Administration has predicted , the U.S. would lose 10,000 square miles of coastal property and islands such as the Bahamas and the Marshalls could be inundated . In the tropical North Atlantic , where most hurricanes originate , surface water temperatures are the highest since record-keeping began in 1865 , supporting projections of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact of climate change on coastal fisheries . In 1995 , marine scientists observed an 80 percent decline in zooplankton off the California coast . These tiny animals are a primary food source for hundreds of fish and bird species . Zooplankton drift with ocean currents and survive by feeding on microscopic phytoplankton plants . A warmer ocean makes it harder for nutrient-rich deep waters to rise and replenish the elements needed for phytoplankton growth . Data in the California study area found that sea surface temperatures have already increased between two and three degrees Fahrenheit over the past 42 years . Higher sea levels and increased erosion are also predicted , and that 's already beginning to make trouble for coastal development . In Wrightsville Beach , North Carolina , for example , a ninestory condo complex that cost $22 million to build is in imminent danger of being washed out to sea , and its angry homeowners ' association is demanding that it be allowed to build a protective seawall-illegal under state laws . The question is now being asked : How far should the government go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature in building so close to an increasingly restive sea ? The much-discussed El Nino occurrence , while a natural event , is a dramatic reversal of the typical planetary weather pattern . Arising in the tropical Pacific , it triggers a shifting jet stream around the Earth . " It worries me that the El Nino pattern of weakened winds and warmer than normal waters is happening more and more frequently , " says Dr. Richard Gammon of the University of Washington . Gammon and other scientists are convinced of a direct link to global warming . A 1991 workshop organized by the United Nations Environment Program and the National Center of Atmospheric Research concluded that El Nino events may become more frequent , because of changes in the upper ocean temperature associated with global warming . In 1982 and 1983 , El Nino 's advent saw a marked decline in harvests of the prized chinook salmon on the west coast . " By 1984 , we were catching these long , skinny salmon . The herring and forage fish also went to hell ; ' recalls Zeke Grader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Associations . This time around , things could be far worse . Last summer , NMFS scientists studying the central and northern California coast found the sea temperatures as high as 14 degrees above normal . Such a trend can be deadly to nutrient-rich , near-shore regions that support fish populations . Photograph Garbage clutters the beach even in the remote Arno Atoll in the Marshall Islands . Photograph Massive fish kills like this one are becoming more common as toxins concentrate in coastal waters . // " Any cold-water bottomfish is in for a tough reproductive season if El Nino persists into the winter and spring of 1998 , " says John Hunter , chief of the federal government 's coastal fisheries division in La Jolla , California . " They do not go with the flow , as do many of the pelagic fish marlin , tuna and sharks . " William Hogarth , NMFS " acting regional administrator for the Southwest , sees another factor at work . " If the El Nino episode strengthens , we should see tropical and temperate marine species shift northward beyond their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's not just El Nino . Last year , scientists found the first direct evidence that ultraviolet rays penetrating the ozone layer over Antarctica were causing damage to the DNA of higher animals . First they saw reduced reproduction rates in plant microorganisms on the underside of the ice-and the base of the food chain . There was also extensive damage in the eggs and larvae of icefish . " It is striking how closely the damage to the fish eggs tracked with the increased intensity of ultraviolet light ; ' said Dr. William Detrich of Northeastern University . TURNING THE TIDE ? * But amid all of this grim news , there are some hopeful signs . An International Coral Reef Initiative was formally adopted by many nations in 1995 , with Australia 's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park becoming a model for similar programs . Thailand brought in experts from the University of Rhode Island 's Coastal Resources Center to form a management plan for Phuket Island , where new tourist resorts are now required to build on-site sewage treatment plants and reduce sediments washing into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coral Reef Strategy . Environmentalists are beginning to pressure international lending institutions like the World Bank to cancel their financial support for massive dam-building projects like the under-construction Three Gorges Dam in China , scheduled to be the largest hydroelectric dam in the world by 2009 . Such projects are responsible for altering freshwater flows and thus decimating many fish species that depend upon rivers for spawning ; half of the original Pacific salmon runs on our West Coast have been lost due to dams , and many others are threatened . The amended Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act passed by Congress in 1996 ordered the NMFS and its eight regional councils to describe and identify " essential fish habitat " in each of 39 existing fishery management plans . This , according to the National Coalition for Marine Conservation 's Hinman , " finally gives fishermen and managers a stronger voice when it comes to protecting habitat . " The Boston Harbor offers one encouraging example of an ongoing and successful clean-up . Since dumping of untreated sludge and grease into the harbor was stopped in 1991 , water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations have cut pollution from sewer overflow pipes by 70 percent . Bluefish , striped bass and cod have returned in substantial numbers ; harbor seals have been seen swimming near the New England Aquarium there . Photograph Cyanide divers serving the live fish trade cause damage to 33 million coral heads annually . // The Rhode Island coast has been the victim of two damaging oil spills over the past decade , with the one in 1996 killing more than one million lobsters . Now the federal government is using $270,000 from a settlement with one tanker owner to build artificial stone reefs where lobsters can hide . " What we are trying to do is mimic the natural ecosystems of Narragansett Bay , " says project director John Catena . The Coast Alliance , a nonprofit organization formed in 1979 to combat development pressure and pollution , is today working with more than 300 state and local groups . One of the Alliance 's primary missions is expansion of the Coastal Barrier Resources System , established by Congress in 1982 . The system currently includes 1.27 million acres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While not prohibiting new development altogether , the program eliminated long-standing federal subsidies for private construction in these fragile ecological areas . This has begun to put a significant crimp in beachfront building , although in 1996 a coalition of Florida landowners and developers succeeded in getting Congress to delete 70 acres from the system . More than 100 efforts in integrated coastal zone management have sprung up in recent years around the globe . Pilot projects are underway in Asia ; six East African nations have agreed to make such management government policy . Marine reserves , first established in the 1970s , now include coral reefs , kelp forests , mangroves , salt marshes , sea grass meadows and subtidal/intertidal habitats . Yet , as Michael Berrill points out in his 1997 book The Plundered Seas , " Conflicting pressures of the competing commercial interests in the region make coastal zone management slow , difficult and usually ineffective . " TING LILLY * Clearly , action must start at the local level . One heartening example is the little island of Bonaire off the Venezuelan coast ( see Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the first restrictions regarding discharge of ballast water into its harbors ( this must happen at least 12 miles out ) , Bonaire has banned anchoring around its coral reefs and adopted a series of strict rules for divers and tourists . Faced with collapsing fisheries , residents of a Philippine village called Bindoy formed a group of volunteer Sea Watchers in the late 1980s . By 1993 the group planted more than 100,000 mangrove trees and had sunk more than 1,000 artificial reefs made of bamboo , tires or concrete . If Bonaire and Bindoy can do it , why is the United Nations Environment Program 's plan for " Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-Based Activities " moving so slowly ? Solving the crisis in our oceans will obviously take a coordinated worldwide effort , but the bright promise of the 1992 Rio conference is not being fulfilled . The oceans know no borders , and cooperation between nations ( now reaching new lows ) is essential if the negative trends are to be reversed . Otherwise , the evocative words of Rachel Carson about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distant memory , with the gravest of consequences for all of us . <p>
