<p> GREELEY - Maybe they were celebrating the non-signing of Steve Emtman . <p> Or maybe they were tuning up for the unsackable Steve Young , the all-world quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers . <p> Whatever the motivation , Denver 's first defensive-line unit got after John Elway &; Co. big-time yesterday , registering at least a half-dozen touch sacks . <p> " That was excellent , " coach Mike Shanahan said . " I saw a couple pressures in there by Harald Hasselbach and Dan Williams , and Michael Dean ( Perry ) , and it was pretty impressive . <p> " You 're as good as your front , and hopefully we 've got the front that 's going to put some pressure on the quarterback . If it does that , obviously it increases the talent level of all those DBs and linebackers , and those guys will be the first to tell you . " <p> Denver 's pass-rushers are n't expected to get many shots at Young in Saturday 's 7 p.m. opening exhibition game at Mile High Stadium . <p> Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver Jerry Rice will start , but Shanahan is n't expecting to see much of the quarterback he called plays for the last three seasons . <p> " I really do n't know , " Shanahan said . " I do n't know if he 'll play 10 or 15 plays . I would n't even be surprised if he did n't play . I think from a league standpoint , they always want you to play at least 10 or 12 plays , and I would think he 'd play somewhere in that area . " <p> Shanahan said he told his successor in San Francisco , offensive coordinator Marc Trestman , that , " I did n't think it 'd be very smart for him to play at all . But they do n't listen to me . " <p> Early outs <p> Do n't expect to see much of the new middle linebacker , Dante Jones , or any of the old wide receiver , Vance Johnson , in Saturday night 's game . <p> Jones is nursing a pulled hamstring while Johnson has tendinitis in his Achilles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue with either player . <p> " Dante 's hamstring is a little better , " Shanahan said . " It was n't quite as bad as we first anticipated . If he 'll be able to play Saturday , I do n't know . That 's a day-to-day process . We 'll evaluate that , but he 'll get a lot of treatment three or four times a day . " <p> With Jones out , Britt Hager will move inside , leaving his spot at right outside linebacker for Allen Aldridge , last year 's second-round draft choice . <p> As for Johnson , Shanahan said , forget it . <p> " I do n't really think so , " Shanahan said . " He 's got that tendinitis , and that tendinitis sometimes is a little bit hard to shake . It 's really painful . He came back and tried to play through it , but it 's still quite sore . What I 'd like to do is rest him . I feel if we can rest him and get it healed then there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the trip to Japan and being on a plane for about a day , he 'll get a lot of rest and there 's a chance maybe he 'll be ready for the 49ers out there . " <p> Hurting Vance 's chances ? <p> " No , I do n't think so , " Shanahan said . " I 've been evaluating Vance for the last two months . He 's come out here and he 's done quite well . The question is will he be able to come back , and will he be able to come back at full speed ? <p> " I know his speed 's there . He 's got excellent hands , and he 's impressed a lot of the coaches . One of the ingredients that usually exists in a camp is everybody when they get hurt wants to come back right away . I think Vance would come out and practice if we asked him to , but I think that 'd set him back for a week and then we would n't be able to evaluate him at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club 's starting fullback , Bernstine still is not fully recovered from major knee surgery , so Derrick Clark will start in his place . <p> Short work <p> The Broncos do n't have a game plan for the 49ers , but they do have a plan for the game . <p> That plan is for the starters to work about 15 plays , then get out of the way so the coaching staff can get about the business of settling on the rest of the 53-man roster . <p> That will be the plan for the first three or four exhibition games , before the emphasis begins to shift toward fine-tuning the offense and the defense for the regular season . <p> Aimless fact of the day <p> The 49ers are n't quite perfect , but they may be better in the preseason than they are in the regular season . Over the last four summers , the Niners have won 17 of their 19 preseason games , going 5-0 in 1991 and ' 92 , 4-1 in ' 93 and 3-1 last year . By comparison , the Broncos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1-4 , 2-2 and 2-3 . <p> And finally <p> On the cover of the 49ers media guide this season is a picture of the club 's world championship ring that features five Super Bowl trophies clustered among 51 diamonds . A single ring is valued at $ 12,000 . Owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr . distributed 120 of them to every full-time employee on the staff at a four-day holiday at The Broadmoor last month , all expenses paid by the club , of course Two San Francisco players will be held out of the game with injuries , cornerback Marquez Pope and guard Derrick Deese ( ankle ) . Tyronne Drakeford will replace Pope in the lineup , while Rod Milstead will replace Deese . The Niners also want to get a long look at former Bronco Kirk Scrafford at both tackle positions Former Broncos defensive-line coach Ernie Stautner was among the camp visitors yesterday . Stautner is just back from Europe , where he coached the Frankfurt Galaxy to the World League championship in a 28-22 victory over the Amsterdam Admirals . With him was Al Luginbill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Karl Dorrell , the new offensive coordinator at the University of Colorado . <p> Two-Minute Drill <p> RANDY HILLIARD , cornerback <p> Q What would you be doing if you were n't a pro football player ? <p> A Probably a mailman . Every now and then , I try to go work in the post office back home in New Orleans . I always talk to them when they come by . <p> Q What 's the worst part about being a pro football player ? <p> A We 're getting stereotyped . If something happens to one football player , one person gets in trouble , then everybody looks at every football player that way . Like on a rape case . They look at us like , ' He 's a rapist . ' <p> Q If you were the NFL commissioner , what would be the first thing you 'd change ? <p> A I 'd change the rule about DBs not bumping the guy after 5 yards . I 'd make it at least 10 yards . That would give them a chance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> A I ring my own bell . It feels like everything 's getting blurry a little bit . It 's not really painful . You 'll snap out of it after about 30 seconds - as long as you keep walking . It 's almost like you 're drunk , and you try to lay down . <p> Q What 's your biggest criticism of the media ? <p> A The media tries to stir up a lot of stuff on a team . The media can get a lot of coaches fired . They can make a player get released . <p> Q What 's the toughest stadium you ever played in ? <p> A Cleveland . We played Denver one year when I was with Cleveland and ( John ) Elway ran for a touchdown , and I saw fans in the Dog Pound throw beer all over him . I do n't know if it was Elway or another quarterback . It had to be a team in which they hated the quarterback , and they hated Elway . <p> Q What was the worst thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A It was a dirty town , but the worst thing about it was when it snowed . When it snows , it sticks . It 'll stay there for days . Slush all over the place . You never see your grass for about a week . <p> Q Do you have any good recruiting stories about going to Northwestern State ? <p> A I was with the players , and they took a lot of us guys out . We were playing quarters ( a drinking game ) . We went back to our rooms to get dressed and go out . And they asked this guy , a big lineman recruit , ' Are you comin ' out with us ? ' and he passed out . He said , ' No , I I " and boom . He did n't even finish his sentence . <p> Q Why 'd you pick Northwestern State ? <p> A They were all seniors when I was entering there . The coach said it would be wide open , and I 'd have a chance . I just wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFC in the Super Bowl ? <p> A I think because of the passing attack . The NFC is usually a run-and-power team . Look at New England , Bill Parcells . He 's a running coach . Look what he 's doing now . He 's throwing the ball .
