How many products can you think of that were manufactured 100 years ago and are still modern and efficient today ? Precious few . Ships , steam engines and virtually all other industrial products designed at the time have been cast into oblivion . There are a few products , however , that were so perfect for their purpose and designed with such timeless efficiency that there seems to be no limit to their practical life  --  one such item is the sewing needle , another is the simple garden hoe . But perhaps the most miraculous of these is an American rifle introduced by Winchester in 1894 . Like crowbars and the carpenter 's claw hammers , the 1894 Winchester lever rifle is a part of our very existence  --  our past , our present and our future . As you read this , more than 6 million working ' 94s have been built , plus another million-plus ' 94 commemoratives . If that fails to impress you , look at it this way : Laid end to end they would stretch more than 5,000 miles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 94 was based on a John Browning patent and was the first lever-action rifle designed for the then-new smokeless powder . The Winchester catalog of 1894 had this to say about its new baby : " We believe that no repeating rifle system ever made will appeal to the eye and understanding of the rifleman as this will ... " The first 1894s came off the assembly line in October of that year and they 've been built on the same piece of ground ever since . There have been too many variations of the ' 94 to bother counting , but the 1915 catalog of the New York Sporting Goods Company , a discount house of its era , lists 14 different configurations . List price was $17.50 for the popular solid frame carbine , but the company sold them for $11.81 . Marlin also unveiled a new lever rifle back in 1894 , and it , too , was called the ' 94 . There was relatively little to compare between the two ' 94s , however , because the Winchester was chambered for next-century whiz-bangs like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished Marlin catered to the more conservative crowd with such calibers .38-40 and .44-40 . About 250,000 original Marlin ' 94s were made before being discontinued in 1935 . You probably wo n't be surprised to hear that both Marlin and Winchester will be offering fancy , limited-edition versions of their respective ' 94s commemorating their 100th birthdays . Winchester in fact , is assembling three different commemorative so there 'll be something for everybody . Winchester will make only 94 of this lushly decorated Custom Limited Edition Centennial Grades ( $4,684 ) , 3,000 of the gold inlaid Limited Edition High Grades ( $1,272 ) and 12,000 of the Grade I ( $811 ) . These centennial ' 94s , like all new Model ' 94s , come with the hammer-block safety and the caliber ( want to guess ? ) is .30-30 WCF . Marlin 's commemorative ' 94 , of which only about 2,500 will be offered , will list at $1,087 and comes in .44-40 . The rifle is characterized by the tasteful restraint that was a hallmark of early Marlins . After all , fine fitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though nicely engraved in Italy , what really catches the eye is the genuine , old-fashioned color case hardening on the receiver , bolt and lever . Like Marlin 's other late-model lever rifles , it has hammer-block safety . BROWNING With all of the fuss over Browning 's accuracy-enhancing BOSS muzzle system , the improvements in its popular A-Bolt rifle , now called the A-Bolt II , went almost unnoticed . With a rifle as fundamentally good as the A-Bolt , it 's difficult to make improvements . The changes for the A-Bolt II are more in the way of refinements , plus a new model . For instance , a full-length anti-bind sleeve has been added to the bolt to keep it more perfectly centered in the receiver . This makes feeding and operation noticeably , slicker and eliminates the tendency for the bolt to be jammed off-center and drag , a fault common with many bolt-action designs . The trigger pull also has been improved by chrome plating the sear so that the pull is smoother and let-off cleaner . The BOSS ( Ballistic Optimizing Shooting System ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here Comes The Boss , " February 1994 ) , is a simple-looking device that controls the vibrations unleashed when a round is fired . Fitted to the muzzle , the BOSS is a ported arrangement that is remarkably effective . Equipped with a calibrated scale , the device can be tuned to maximize accuracy by rotating the adjustable weight . Added to the A-Bolt II lineup is a varmint version that comes in .223 and .22-250 Remington . This new model has a heavier barrel than standard , plus a stock shape that is better adapted for shooting from rests . I have n't tested this one yet , but with a heavy barrel plus the BOSS it ought to be a real performer .

DAKOTA ARMS Someday before too long , Dakota Arms will be considered one of the great American sporting arms makers . It is n't giant like Ruger or Remington , but the company has already proven that custom-quality guns can be built on a production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a classic bolt-action sporter built on an action that looks a lot like the old Model 70 Winchester and then expanded its line to include a trim single-shot . This year it unveiled a varmint classic model for devoted seekers of the 500-yard woodchuck kill . Rather than simply adding a fat barrel and stock to its existing action the way other gunmakers have done , Dakota designed a new accuracy-specific action . The company then fitted it with a unique stock that 's not only designed for accurate shooting , but that 's also more stylish than other varmint rigs . I 'm going to buy one , and that 's probably the highest praise a gun writer can pay . Mine will be a .22-250 , but Dakota will make almost any caliber you want . Speaking of which , ask about the new line of big-game Dakota calibers . The cartridges have a smoother case design than belted magnums and are available in 7mm , .300 , .330 , .375 , .416 and .450 . For more information , contact Dakota Arms Inc. , HC55 , Box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KIMBER Remember Kimber ? How could you forget ? They 're the people who brought us classy .22s and elevated the lowly rimfire to an object of desire . But the company 's ownership changed hands in the late 1980s and within months things went from right to wrong and the lights went off . Now the lights are on again and Kimber is being run by the solid gun people who founded the company . But the new Kimber 82C is n't quite the same as the beautiful and accurate 82B rifle the company built a decade ago . It 's still a sweet thing to hold and behold but , if anything , it 's more accurate than ever thanks to adapting an accuracy-enhancing pillar bedding system . Even the catalog is a work of art , and you can get one by contacting the company ; Kimber of America , 9039 S.E. Jannsen Rd. , Clackamas , OR 97015 ( 503-656-1704 ) . REMINGTON Every year , it seems , Remington announces enough new models and variations of old models to write a book . This is frustrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write this report , and once again Remington has a whole catalog full of new guns . It 's fascinating to observe how many variations can be built around a single basic rifle design , and the ever-adaptable Model 700 has proven it can be everything from an Olympic target rifle to a professional hunter 's elephant gun . This year the M-700 becomes the APR ( African Plains Rifle ) and the AWR ( Alaskan Wilderness Rifle ) . The venerable model also sprouts a 26-inch fluted barrel to become a high-tech tack driver , and borrows some varmint-shooting tricks to become a long-range big-game specialist . The latter developments are attached to a new rifle called the Sendero , a name borrowed from the long , straight trails slashed through the deep Texas brush country . Shots at deer from high stands spaced along the senderos are often measured in hundreds of paces , which call for some far-reaching equipment . The groundwork for this rifle was laid a couple of years back when Remington announced a varmint shooting version of the M-700 that utilized a synthetic stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system eliminated some of the accuracy problems inherent in traditional bedding , and the new rifle , called that Varmint Synthetic , proved exceptionally accurate . So the guys in the Remington think-tank reasoned that the same principle would work in a big-game rifle . And that 's exactly what the Sendero is , a serious hunting rifle with an aluminum bedding cradle molded into the synthetic stock . This means that it should shoot like a target rifle and suffer virtually no shift of zero . The Sendero comes in .25-06 , .270 , 7mm Remington Magnum and .300 Winchester Magnum . The barrel length is 26 inches , which is in interesting story . For years I 've fussed in print and complained to Remington 's bosses about the 24-inch barrel limit on their M-700 rifles . Some models , certainly the hot varmint and magnum rifles , would do better with more pipe . My pleas were passed along to the production staff and back came the word : " Tell Carmichel our hammer forging machinery is limited to 24-inch barrels . " But then someone took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will make longer barrels ? This is why the new Senderos have 26-inch barrels and so do the current Varmint Synthetics . The added length means more muzzle velocity for some fast-stepping calibers . And speaking of barrels , one of the new Remingtons is equipped with a fluted barrel . It 's called the VS-SF ; ( Varmint Synthetic-Stainless Fluted  --  phew ! ) and the purpose of the six flutes , or grooves , which run nearly the length of the barrel , is to take weight off the barrel while maintaining a large percentage of its stiffness . Boiled down , this translates into better accuracy . Fluting is a proven practice , frequently applied to target rifles when excess weight becomes too cumbersome . The flutes also increase surface area , which helps the barrel cool faster . The new VS-SF comes in .223 , .22-250 , .220 Swift and .308 . A happy surprise is that the VS-SF , despite its Space age look , is not an expensive , special-order , custom shop model . It 's available as a standard item on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do come from Remington 's ever-busy custom shop are the previously mentioned African Plains and Alaskan Wilderness models . At first look neither of these rifles seems particularly impressive , and you may wonder why they mandate custom shop attention and craftsmanship ( not to mention custom shop prices and waiting-list delivery ) . But on closer inspection the differences are noticeable . The APR has a nicely contoured and checkered stock of laminated wood and the AWR , made for Alaska 's gun-eating climate , has a stock made of fiberglass and graphite with Kevlar reinforcing . In other words , it will double as a canoe paddle without ill effect . Although the barrel and action of the AWR have non-reflective black coatings , they are made entirely of stainless steel . The barrels of both rifles ( 24 inches for AWR and 26 inches for APR ) are made and specially contoured in the custom shop , which makes them all the more exclusive , and probably more accurate , with calibers for both being 7mm Remington Magnum , .300 Winchester Magnum , .300 Weatherby , .338 Winchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Model Seven is now available in black and white ( stainless steel with a black synthetic stock ) and , coupled with its 6.25-pound weight , could be the ultimate wilderness rifle if available calibers were more imaginative . At present the caliber choiccs are only .243 , 7mm-08 and .308 , but how about the all-but-forgotten .350 Remington Magnum , which would also fit the action ? It would jar your filling 's loose but would be great for tippy-toeing in black timber for elk or wading through moose marshes . And due to popular demand , Remington even lengthened the barrel from 18-1/2 inches to 20 inches .

RUGER The .22 Hornet was outdated before most of us were born , taking a back seat to a host of rounds that shoot flatter , faster and more accurately , but that has n't had much effect on its popularity . There is something about the elfin Hornet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charisma will glow even brighter with Ruger 's Model 77/22 Hornet . The current 77/22 rimfire is Ruger 's stylish " grown-up " .22 bolt rifle with rotary magazine . By stretching the action length a bit and converting the bolt to centerfire , the new 77/22 looks like it was I born to be a Hornet . Even Hornet ammo , which has not always been feeder-friendly because of its rimmed case , works slickly in the reconfigured six-shot rotary magazine . This is n't a rifle for braggarts or bounders , but rather for those who seek the spiritual solace of unpresumptuous shots across the fields of summer . The word " genteel " says it best . The same goes for Ruger 's new International 10/22 Rimfire autoloader . In Rugerese , " International " means a full-length style stock . This European-style stocking , which descends from the graceful Mannlicher rifles , has been used to good effect by Ruger on its Model 77 and Number One rifles , and now makes a similar impact on its 10/22 .

SAVAGE What ever happened to Savage ? For generations it was a big-name gunmaker manufacturing rifles such as the legendary Model 99 lever gun . Then the company suffered a series of management upheavals , and when the dust settled there was n't much left . But now at the Savage helm there is someone who apparently knows what he is doing , and the future of the fine old gun company looks not just promising but even exciting . You 'll quickly discover the changes when you open your copy of the colorful 1994 Savage catalog . There are a dozen new variations of its M-110 bolt rifle , plus other interesting innovations . There are too many to , describe here , but to give you an idea there 's an M-116 Safari Express that comes in serious calibers and sports such features as folding express sights like the great British rifles and an adjustable muzzle brake . Why an adjustable brake , you ask ? Well , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting nearby because so much of the muzzle blast is deflected to the side . With the Savage adjustable brake set on the " off " position , the blast is not nearly so objectionable to your neighbor . But , of course , the record is noticeable . Also new are the Savage 114 CU , which is styled along classic lines with select-grade oil finished wood ; and the 116 FSAK which , in contrast , goes post-modern with stainless steel , a synthetic stock , fluted barrel and adjustable muzzle brake .

U.S. REPEATING ARMS Back to Winchester : Last summer , U.S. Repeating Arms Company , maker of Winchester guns , sent an announcement to gun writers marked " Exclusive and Confidential . " This was a brilliant piece of promotion because gun writers get giddy when in the possession of confidential information and frantically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the " Pre-1964 " Model 70 bolt rifle would be returning in 1994 , which , of course , created great excitement among fans of the old M-70 . But what does " Pre- ' 64 " mean ? Since its introduction in the 1930s , the Winchester M-70 represented just about everything a bolt-action sporting rifle should be : well-built with the best materials , accurate , reliable and stylish . Even today it remains the standard by which other bolt rifles are judged and has a cult following . But like most fine guns it was costly to build , requiring lots of skilled labor . So in 1964 it was replaced by a new M-70 that was just about the ugliest rifle ever conceived . Enraged fans of the old M-70 began a hate campaign against the " new " M-70 that has continued for 30 years . Their battle cry has been " Bring back the Pre- ' 64 ! " a proposition that has caused Winchester all sorts of grief . In fact other than being as ugly as a road-kill possum , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclosure  --  and accuracy was often better than the older style . In time the despised pressed checkering was replaced by cut checkering , the overall styling and finish improved , and the new M-70 even developed a loyal following and some much-deserved respect . Still , the clamor for the Pre- ' 64 rifle persisted . When pressed to explain the attraction of the old-style rifle , many of uncovered point to the external Mauser-Style extractor . Actually , there are other , more significant differences between the old and new M-70s , but the extractor became symbolic of the differences . So a few years back external extractors were installed on a few high-grade M-70s and gradually extended to other versions . This year the symbolic external extractor is a standard feature of most of the M-70 lineup , except for the three economy models and a few others . But ! Is the new " Pre- ' 64 M-70 " the same rifle that was built before 1964 ? No , of course not . It looks different , the shape and finish are different and very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 64 barrel and action wo n't fit in an old Pre- ' 64 stock and vice versa . No even close . But that is n't as important as the fact that the new M-70 , with or . without the Pre- ' 64 extractor , has evolved into a good-looking , slick-working high-performance rifle for the 1990s . This year there are 13 versions of M-70 , not counting the fancy custom models . The .416 Remington Magnum and .284 Winchester Magnum have been added to the caliber list along with  --  are you ready for this ?  --  the .220 Swift ! The Swift can be had in the heavy varmint version of the M-70 with a 26-inch stainless-steel barrel and marksman-style synthetic stock . I 've already tested one of these and our off-the-shelf sample grouped five shots inside a half-inch at 100 yards . That 's with handloaded 52-grain bullets loaded to 4,000 feet per second ( fps ) . Now all we need is for U.S. ammo makers to turn out some really swift ammo in the 4,100 fps range the way they did many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arms Company Inc. , 275 Winchester Ave. , New Haven , CT 06511 ( 203-789-5000 ) . <p>
