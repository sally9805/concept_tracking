WHEN THE GROUND BEGAN SHAKING UNDER EAST GERmany more than three years ago , , the race was on between the unification of Germany and the unification of Western Europe . Last month the results came in . Germany won . <P> West European unification was premised on the cold war : a divided Europe and a diminished ( West ) Germany held within the bounds of a deep , strong , European union . Given time , this might have come about . Had the cold war persisted another decade or so , a federal Western Europe might have been established in the shelter , as it were , of the Berlin Wall . <P> But the Wall came down and time ran out . The new Germany became preoccupied with the task of absorbing the east . Moreover , the new Germany grew too large to be swallowed by a federal Europe . The Maastricht treaty , the penultimate stop on the road to a federal Europe , was a last-ditch attempt to deny that reality . <P> Last month denial became impossible . Europe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maastricht . What happened ? The ERM tied E.C . currencies to the German mark . But much of Europe  --  notably Britain and Italy  --  was unable to keep up . The German central bank had jacked up interest rates to dampen the inflation caused by huge deficit spending on eastern Germany . The weaker E.C . countries had a choice : a ) match Germany 's high interest rates and risk both deep recession and political suicide ; or b ) drop out of the ERM . Not surprisingly , they chose b ) . <P> Amid the chaos of the currency crisis , it became clear that German political vision is as yet no match for its economic dynamism . Germany is Europe 's de facto leader , but will not act the part . As Americans have learned to their constant chagrin , leadership means sacrificing some measure of national interest to the greater alliance interest . Germany knows that its interest rates set the standard for the rest of Europe . By setting its rates ruinously high , Germany was announcing that in fighting domestic inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into recession . The rest of Europe has just announced that it will not be so led . <P> After the ERM debacle , it is clear that the grand vision of a federal Europe is an illusion . What then does Europe do ? <P> Do more of what it does best : free trade . The E.C . ' s single-market project will soon allow the virtual free flow of capital , goods and labor within the Twelve . Speaking last month in Washington , Margaret Thatcher made the case for a rapid widening of the single market . First , east to its European neighbors . And then boldly west  --  to North America . <P> Free trade between Europe and America has been bruited about before . It was raised by National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft , unfortunately without result . But with the fading of visions of a federal Europe , it acquires a new urgency . Today , two potentially antagonistic trade blocs are going up on both sides of the Atlantic . The U.S. is afraid that a Fortress Europe will shut its trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free Trade Agreement , which would create a trading zone demographically larger than the E.C .
