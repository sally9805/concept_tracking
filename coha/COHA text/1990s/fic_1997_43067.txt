I 'M HAVING A GREAT NIGHT . Folks from all over the Carolinas are dialing me up , filling the air with their howls , like a bunch of ancient warriors gathered about a campfire , working themselves up into a killing mood . Bob , the station manager , as if he knows what I 'm thinking , dances a war dance outside the booth , what he always does when I 'm really rolling . Peggie , who sells advertising , shakes her head , but she knows that tomorrow will be a good day for her , that she wo n't have to wiggle her ass or shake her tits to make those sales . <p> We 're talking about gun control . They 're calling in from mobile phones as they drive into our signal on the interstate ; they 're calling from bars and bedrooms and phone booths . I imagine all that hate pulsating through the night like colored gas in a tube . <p> " Guns could disappear , " I say to a caller . " The Japanese did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guns , and the country returned to the sword for 250 years . He lopped off a few heads , and folks came around to his way of thinking . " <p> " I got a made-in-America .357 right here in my truck , " he says . " I got it loaded with Teflon-coated rounds . Go right through a flak jacket . <p> I just hope somebody tries to carjack me . I just hope they do . " In North Carolina it 's legal to carry a handgun in a car , and you can carry it on your person if you have a permit . All you have to do to get a permit is prove you do n't have a criminal record or have n't spent a few months in a mental institution . And take a course in gun safety , and pay a small fee . It 's easy . <p> I wonder what some of the callers would say if they knew I do n't own a gun of any kind . Once Bob had us do a show from a pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place shows a woman in a two-fisted firing stance , filling a male torso full of holes . They had me shoot a few rounds at one of those torsos , but I did n't do well at all , even though I 'd qualified with a .45 when I was in the army . Bob told me he was shocked at my ineptitude . <p> Then the caller becomes inarticulate . He snorts like a wild hog , makes sounds that are half words and half snarls . I let the listeners enjoy a little of that before I cut him off . We go to a commercial break . <p> " Ease up a little on the intellectual stuff , " Bob tells me . " Ease up . This is n't public radio . " <p> I had enjoyed my job with public radio , where I hosted a talk show devoted to the standard liberal causes . Sometimes I long for the slower pace of that life , but I do n't hold it against them for firing me . I came to work drunk one too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm making plenty of money . I still drink , but I have n't come to work drunk a single time . I do that at home . I 've got it under control . <p> " But I 'm hot , " I say . <p> " Back off a little . " <p> " Everybody loves me . All those truck drivers and mill hands and hog farmers . You 've seen the mail . " <p> " That 's right , Luther . Remember that . " <p> I live in the two-story white house I grew up in on one of those oak-lined Charlotte streets . My father is dead . My mother is in a nursing home . I go to see her every Sunday , and she has no idea who I am . <p> With all the money they 're paying me to be a local radio personality , it was no problem to put in a tennis court , the kind surfaced with brick dust like at Monte Carlo and Roland Garros . It 's the only red clay tennis court in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina . I pick up the phone for the next call . <p> " Every man , woman , and child in the United States should be given an AK-47 , " a voice says . <p> I know who it is , although I can hardly bring myself to even think his name . It 's a voice I remember well , coming out of the night , wrapping itself around me just as it 's doing now . If I speak , I imagine some spell will be broken and that voice will be gone , spinning off into the night , lost out there amid the clamor of the mob . <p> " Is that you , Thac ? " I ask . <p> I know that voice from when I was in a radio research company in Vietnam . We monitored radio traffic from a base camp near Pleiku . With the help of interpreters , we tried to identify individual units down to the platoon level . That way we could keep track of the movements of regiments and divisions . Everyone in Saigon was worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they all remembered Dienbienphu . It was in the back of command 's mind , some bad dream that might come true . <p> " Where are you , buddy ? " I ask . <p> " Roland Garros , " he says . <p> We often talked about playing a match at Roland Garros after the war was over . Thac had spent time in Paris as a student at the Sorbonne . I transfer the call to another line , so I can talk off the air , and go to an unscheduled commercial break . Bob is outside the booth , looking at me strangely , probably wondering if I 've started coming to work drunk . <p> Thac says he 's staying at a hotel . I agree to meet him in the morning . I tell him that I have to get off the line and back to the show . We hang up . <p> Thac was my counterpart on the other side , a brother officer . He appeared on our tactical frequency one night , asking to speak to anyone who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way that soldiers in the trenches at Vicksburg became friends , or Germans and British soldiers in World War I. Later they would kill each other . Thac and I would have done that if we had met in the jungle , but we only met over the radio . <p> The talk about AK-47s stirs the audience into a frenzy , makes listeners reach for their telephones . Soon I 'm having a conversation with someone who argues that no child under six should be issued a rifle Bob has returned to the booth with the engineers . He sits there with a satisfied look on his face . <p> Bob started the show with Jack Perkins , but Jack quit one night , announced on the air that he was going to live in Alaska , that he did n't think much of anyone stupid enough to listen to his show . Told his listeners that he did n't much care for Charlotte , that city of trees and churches . Said he wanted to live somewhere where he was not necessarily at the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Anchorage , doing the midnight-to-six shift , broadcasting the music of the ' 60s to . army guys and trappers and Indian villages . I was drafted as a temporary substitute . To everyone 's surprise , I was wildly successful . <p> " Who was that ? " Bob asks . The show is over , and I 'm preparing to , go home . <p> " Some guy I knew in Vietnam , " I say . <p> " A tennis player ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> Bob worries about me making references to tennis on the air-or classical music or jazz or books . He says elitist talk is bad for advertising . During those long nights in Vietnam , Thac and I talked about exceptionally good Wimbledons or Paris Opens . He had learned to play tennis in France and claimed to have served once as a ball boy at the French Open . His interest in the game was frowned upon by his superiors , who regarded it as a bourgeois sport . <p> In the morning I drive to the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to come up to his room . <p> When he opens the door he 's about what I expect to see , a small man whose hair is turning gray around the temples . <p> " Come in , Luther , " he says as he shakes my hand . " I heard your voice and knew it was you . Let me make you a drink . Whiskey and water ? " <p> " Sounds good , " I say . I notice right away that he walks with a limp . <p> " Bullet through the ankle , " he says . " I can run , but I ca n't jump . " He explains that he is here on business . He wants to import pharmaceuticals into Vietnam , so he 's been up around Durham talking with those big companies . That 's where he first heard my voice on the radio . I 'm surprised , because our signal does n't usually reach that far north . <p> We had been talking to each other for a couple of months when abruptly he disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hendrix tape . He was playing me The Magic Flute . Major Wallace , who ran the operation , thought I was a little strange , but he did n't take my eccentricities seriously . After all , I was just a reserve officer , and he was a West Point man . <p> Under his direction we looked for deviations from standard radio procedure , individual idiosyncrasies that would help us identify the operators . But it had been difficult , because their discipline was excellent . I told Thac how our South Vietnamese interpreters had made fun of their northern accents , the same way that Major Wallace , who was from New York , had made fun of my Savannah accent : " It 's room , Luther , " he used to say . " Not rum . Jesus , but you talk strange . " <p> " What happened to you ? " I ask . <p> " My superiors discovered that I was having those conversations , " Thac says . " They did not approve . I was put in command of an infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . <p> " No , we had difficult times . " <p> I think of Thac wandering around in the jungle with his platoon , all because of his conversations with me . It makes me sad thinking that happened to him , and I tell him so . <p> " I was fortunate , " he says . " A B-52 strike got our bunker . Everyone was killed . I would have died if I had been there . " <p> " Saved by Jimi Hendrix , " I say . <p> " Do you listen to him now ? " " No . " <p> " I still love Mozart . " <p> " We 'll go to my house and listen to Mozart . Why do n't you have dinner ? Spend the night . " <p> Thac says he will , so I call Verna at work to let her know I 'm bringing someone home . She moved in with me about six months ago . She works at a health club , where she teaches aerobics . I suppose you could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to think more deeply about why she 's with me , a man who prefers his women soft . Maybe it 's her big breasts that attracted me . Verna dislikes them . She 'd rather be much smaller , more athletic . <p> No woman like her , beautiful and twenty-five , would ever have taken up with Luther Watkins , the public radio disc jockey . On the air I 'm called " The Professor . " Bob came up with that name . What the audience likes , Bob says , is to listen to a liberal like me espousing conservative causes . It 's like they are watching me being born again every afternoon on the radio . They take a sort of joy in my denigration , I once observed . And Bob said I was exactly right-that was what he had in mind , he just did n't have the words to express it . <p> Verna says she 's dying to meet Thac . She does tend toward hyperbole . I know that simply means it 's OK with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on my way home . <p> We go to the grocery store and buy two pounds of king-sized shrimp , fresh from the waters off Charleston , the kid behind the counter tells us . Thac puts a couple of six-packs of German beer in the buggy . I buy a chocolate amaretto cake at the bakery . Verna wo n't touch that , but I can eat whatever I want . <p> Thac is impressed with the house . He does n't say anything , but I can tell he is . He looks everything over carefully . <p> " They pay you well for insulting people on the radio ? " he says . <p> I have n't told him about the court , which I 've saved as a surprise . He sees it through the kitchen window when we bring in the groceries . <p> " Terre battue ? " he says . <p> " That 's right , " I say . " If there 's another one in North Carolina , I do n't know about it . We 'll play that match before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Yes , " he says . " Whenever I can . " <p> I put The Magic Flute on the player and make us drinks . Thac begins to explain to me what is going on in the music . He knows about it ; he knows about the libretto . He never did that in Vietnam , probably thought it was n't worth the trouble , but now I can see that he really wants me to understand it , to appreciate it in the same way he does . The rest of the morning we listen to it , playing sections of the disc over and over until I can feel that music in my bones . <p> I order us pizza for lunch , and we drink the German beer with it . We eat half of the cake . After lunch we give Mozart a rest . Thac puts Carmen on the player . After Carmen we play Tristan und Isolde . Every now and then I ask a question , and he always has the answer . Thac knows those operas backwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to opera in a long time . Verna likes New Age stuff , which I ca n't stand . <p> When Verna comes home from work , we are in the middle of La Boheme . <p> " I could hear that out in the driveway , " Verna says . <p> I turn down the sound and introduce her to Thac . She 's dressed in a spandex exercise suit . Thac looks at her with fascination , as if he has never seen a beautiful woman before . <p> " So you knew each other in Vietnam , " she says . <p> I explain how we talked on the radio , how we never saw one another , and how Thac had suddenly disappeared . Verna was asleep when I came home after my telephone conversation with Thac and was gone before I woke . I had considered waking her to tell her about Thac but decided against it . " We lived like animals in the jungle , " Thac says . " We ate such food as pigs eat . " <p> " Tell me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I has said a word about Vietnam all afternoon . " I ate steaks , " I say . <p> It was true . We had it easy in base camp . Occasionally the enemy would lob a few mortar shells into the camp or drop a rocket in on us , but mostly it was pretty quiet . <p> Neither of them laughs at my comment about the steaks . They ignore me . <p> " They hunted us from the air , " Thac says . " My men died from bombs and malaria and dysentery . We had little medicine . " <p> Thac goes on talking about the six months he spent in the jungle . He tells the story in great detail . I 'm not that interested , but Verna is riveted . That surprises me . He describes how he was shot in the foot , how he was evacuated back to Hanoi for treatment . He spent the rest of the war directing the repair of a bridge that American planes blew up at least once a week . Thac brags that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each attack . His wife died in a B-52 raid on Hanoi . <p> All this flows out of Thac , who speaks it to Verna and not to me . It 's like I 'm not in the room , or that he assumes it 's a story I already know . But we never talked about the war on the radio . I get fresh drinks for Thac and me ; Verna does n't drink . Thac takes one sip and puts it down . He talks while I watch the ice cubes in his drink melt . He talks on and on . I expect that Verna will get impatient with him and make some excuse to break off the conversation , for Verna is not a good listener . The war was over when she was still a baby , and I ca n't imagine her having any interest in it . But she sits on the floor with her legs crossed and listens intently , every now and then asking a question . An hour goes by , and he 's still talking <p> I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those , but she likes the smell of cigars . I get one for myself and offer one to Thac , who accepts . He 's stopped talking . He sips his drink . I offer to get him some ice , but he says he does n't need any . <p> We light up . There 's nothing I want to ask Thac about his life in the jungle . He 's told it all to Verna . He sits on the couch beside me and leans his head back and blows a smoke ring toward the ceiling . I do n't know why I find that amazing , but I do . I tell him I do . <p> " I was a great smoker of cigars in Paris , " he says . <p> Verna says that she 's going to do something with the shrimp , that we should sit and talk . <p> " Y'all reminisce , " she says . <p> Thac surely can not have anything more to say about the war , nothing to add to that litany of disease , starvation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning , " I say . " Maybe you can wear a pair of Verna 's shoes . " <p> " I have shoes and a racket , " he says . " I have played every day for a week . " <p> " Do you play in Hanoi ? " I ask . <p> " There are courts in Saigon , " he says . " We play on them during the monsoon . Everyone calls us amphibians . " He tells me that balls and strings are difficult to obtain and expensive . He is the number one player in Saigon . " The level is not high if an old man who can not jump can be number one , " he says . At dinner we switch to wine . Verna has put chopsticks at our places instead of knives and forks . <p> " I 'll get a fork , " I say . " I 'm not very good with these things . " <p> I know that Verna is even worse than me . Thac shows her what 's wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an expert . I stick with my fork . <p> I begin to tell Verna about my year with the radio research company . I know that my experience is bland compared to Thac 's , but once I get started I ca n't help myself . And Verna seems interested . Thac concentrates on his food and the wine . Soon we 're into a second bottle . <p> I tell Verna about listening to the war at night , of all that radio traffic from companies and platoons , of men calling desperately for evacuation helicopters and the calm , professional voices telling them they had none to send . We were eavesdropping on the war , those transmissions sailing across mountains and rivers and savannahs . The tropical night was alive with them . <p> We have ice cream for dessert , and then coffee . Afterward I serve brandy . Thac and I smoke another cigar . Verna excuses herself and goes off to bed . <p> I turn on the player , and we listen to La Traviata . When Thac goes to sleep toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . After he heads off to bed , I drink a beer and listen to the rest of the opera . Then I go to bed . <p> Verna does n't stir . She sleeps through thunderstorms . Last year when the hurricane came , she slept through that . <p> As I drift off , I think of Thac wandering about in the jungle , watching his men die . The army could have sent me anywhere . I never asked for radio research . I have nothing to feel ashamed about . <p> When I wake to the sound of Jimi Hendrix , it is n't light yet . Verna is gone . I get out of bed and walk into the hallway . The hall is in darkness and so is the room below , but in the glow from the streetlights outside I can see Verna kneeling before Thac with her head between his legs . He is seated on the sofa . I know his head is thrown back , because the red tip of his cigar is pointed at the ceiling . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart pounding . It 's not that I am completely surprised , but if it happened I expected it would be with one of those young studs at the health club . I decide to say nothing to Verna or Thac . Thac will be gone tomorrow , and I 'll never see him again . In a few weeks I 'll start some quarrel with Verna . It will be easy to get rid of her , and I 'll be left alone and at peace . Charlotte is filled with women who like the sound of my voice in the night . <p> Though I try to go to sleep before Verna comes back to bed , I ca n't . When she does return , she smells of cigar smoke . I pretend to be asleep . Soon she dozes off , and I lie there listening to the regular sound of her breathing . I try to imagine that I can smell Thac on her , underneath the cigar smoke , but all I can detect is the sweet scent of the soap she uses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verna wakes me . I avoid looking directly into her eyes . <p> " I made you breakfast , " she says . " Thac is already up . " <p> When I go downstairs , Thac , dressed in tennis clothes , is seated at the kitchen table eating eggs and bacon . Verna has gone to work . <p> " Eat , " he says . " We can play . I must be on a plane to Atlanta at two o'clock . " <p> It 's eight o'clock . We have plenty of time . I sit down and eat . I wonder what I will be thinking the next time Verna has her head between my legs . <p> Instead of talking to Thac , I concentrate on my breakfast . He smokes a cigarette while I finish . <p> After I dress we cross the dew-wet grass to the court . It is already a very hot day , but I imagine that Thac is as acclimated to the heat as I am . When we start to warm up , I see why he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't for that shattered ankle , I would n't stand a chance . But his lack of mobility is going to be the difference , I tell myself . That and the fact that most of his play has been on fast surfaces . On concrete , in Saigon . <p> We both play sluggishly at first . Thac does n't have much of a volley and ca n't jump for overheads , so on important points I bring him in and lob him . Most of his smashes go into the net . I win the first set easily . <p> I think play has gotten rid of my anger , but toward the end of the second set it returns as blind rage . I net a couple of easy shots . I have a chance to hit Thac with an overhead , but I miss . Now I wish we were boys on a football field . I would take much pleasure in hitting Thac with a hard tackle . <p> Thac looks like he 's tiring . Perhaps , I think , he is still jet-lagged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have helped . I give him a point here and there until the score is even . We agreed not to use tiebreakers , so by the time he wins the second set , the score is 14-16 And the third goes better than I could have expected . Though I do n't give him any points , he jumps out to a three-game lead , which I manage to close . Then it is six all , and we begin to trade games . I 'm hoping he 'll cramp up . I want to see him writhing on the clay . <p> At ten all I can tell he 's close to cramping . He lifts his left leg and pulls it up behind him to stretch the muscle . <p> " I am obliged to retire , " he says . <p> " We 'll call it a tie , " I say . <p> We drink some water together at the net . <p> " Sit down and rest , " I say . <p> " No , if I sit I will cramp , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Thac . I never pretended I was in love with Verna , and the only thing she loves is her own body . I think about saying these things to Thac but decide not to . <p> " You have time to sit in the Jacuzzi , " I say . " We 'll get some fluids into you . " <p> We walk back to the house . Thac has taken off his shirt . A shrapnel scar wanders under his right nipple . <p> He showers and then gets into the Jacuzzi . I fix myself a drink and give Thac a quart of Gatorade . I sit in a rocking chair and smoke a cigar . Verna likes to make love in the Jacuzzi , to cavort as if we are a pair of porpoises . <p> Thac and I have leftover pizza for lunch , and the rest of the German beer . Then I call him a cab . <p> When the cab arrives and Thac starts out the door , I offer him the Jimi Hendrix disc . <p> " No , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> There 's not the slightest hint , no tremor in his voice , that would let me know that he knows I know . I walk out to the cab with him , and we shake hands . <p> " Call me the next time you 're in town , " I say . <p> He smiles . " Come to Ho Chi Minh City and play on my courts , " he says . <p> Then he 's gone . I go back inside . I call Verna , but she 's at lunch . <p> I sit on the couch and have another drink and think about tonight 's show . We 're going to talk about busing . <p> I kick off my shoes and put my feet up . I set my drink on the table . Then I close my eyes and think of those nights when Thac 's voice would appear , how I 'd listen and wonder what the man was like who was sitting in a bunker outside Hanoi , both of us plugged into the war , listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those voices from the past , a great chorus of pain and despair , rising out of those forest-covered mountains , sweeping over the coastal plain , and sailing out above the South China Sea . I sit very still and attentive before my memory , searching for individual voices , as if I am trying to identify the singer of an aria on a faulty disc . I imagine playing tennis with Thac in Saigon during one of those days of the monsoon , the warm wind steady off the sea , the clouds low and thick over the city , the air filled with a fine mist . The concrete courts are slick . The balls are heavy with water . We move carefully , as if we are playing on ice , but I know that neither of us is going to fall . We are safe . <p> I wonder if Verna considers herself safe , protected by her perfect body . Maybe she was born safe , could have wandered through that jungle with Thac and never received a scratch . I imagine touching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To my surprise , instead of being moved to anger or disgust by thoughts of her and Thac , I imagine something entirely different , something I can not quite name . All I know is that it will be a good feeling . Then I realize that she will be a connection with Thac , like his voice on the radio . <p> I am not going to drive her away . I am going to hang on to her for as long as I can . <p>
