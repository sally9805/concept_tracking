<p> Susan Bobbitt describes her Overton , Texas , home decor as " classic garage sale . " For her , buying used furniture and household items is a kick , especially when it means visiting the sprawling Brimfield Antique Show in central Massachusetts . Despite the name , Brimfield is often viewed as one of the biggest and best-known flea markets in the world , since much of what sells here is not old enough ( 100 years or more ) to fit the strict definition of antiques . That 's hardly important to Ms. Bobbitt , a real estate agent who 's been drawn to Brimfield by its reputation for selling just about everything imaginable - from large armoires and rugs to vintage toasters , cameras , toys , and marbles . Like many treasure hunters who scour the secondhand landscape , Bobbitt often waits until inspiration strikes to find that bargain or special item that gives character to a home . This time it came in the form of a large ceramic crock and stand . She 'll use it to serve ice tea during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good buy was secondary . " I really liked it , " she says . And " with antiques and collectibles , if you get tired of whatever you purchased you can resell it and get your money back , " Bobbitt says . " With new furniture you ca n't do that . " In an age of cookie-cutter department stores and fixed prices , flea markets have a special appeal . For those looking for a touch of individuality in their homes , these browsers ' bazaars are among the last sources of truly unique artifacts . And they are one of the few places in the United States where haggling is acceptable . Of course , there are flea markets and there are flea markets . Some cater to people looking to decorate their homes with old furnishings , housewares , and collectibles . Other markets primarily sell new merchandise - closeouts , liquidations , inexpensive imported goods , and collectibles . " At many new flea markets , 50 percent of the merchandise is new , " says Cuba Ford , publisher of the Flea Market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new merchandise can turn off people who think of flea markets more as rummage sales than as discount mini-malls . Some places fuse the two elements together . The Great Smokies Craft Fair and Flea Market in Sevierville , Tenn. , has 230 vendors inside and 115 outside . Everything sold inside is factory direct , collectible , or new , says proprietor Evelyn Ogle . " Used " and " old " are the operative words outside . Another amalgamated market is the 80-acre Fort Lauderdale ( Fla . ) Swap Shop , owned by Preston Henn . He calls it the second-largest tourist attraction in the state , a massive complex with a three-story building , a food court , and free circus at its center . While much of the merchandise is new , the Swap Shop also hosts many garage-sale type vendors . Finding treasure in such a mega-market is no easy task . " That 's what makes the flea market so fascinating , " Mr. Henn says . " You have junk , of course , but you have some things that are very valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the reason you need to spend time walking around . " Ford of the Flea Market News says there are more than 2,500 flea markets in the United States and an average of about 200 vendors per market . Whether a flea market is set up in a deserted strip mall , a vacant furniture store , or a parking lot , sprawl is part of the package . At Brimfield , where more than 5,000 dealers pitch a tent city in the grassy fields , a parking attendant reminds customers , " it 's a quarter mile to the fair and 20 miles around the tables . " The six-day exhibition occurs in May , July , and September . A shopper can easily spend several days wandering this bazaar , and many do , especially serious antique collectors . For some dealers , like Joe Rupert of Hamlin , N.Y. , this is the next stop on the summer circuit . He once owned an antique shop , but gave it up to hit the road . " A shop involves a lot of overhead and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to a place like Brimfield and you have the right merchandise , you can sell more in four or five days than you 'd sell in a whole month or two from a shop . " Unlike many dealers , who specialize , Mr. Rupert has a variety of goods , from washboards to lamps to glassware . This mix has already paid dividends , with a pair of 20-foot blue jeans , used promotionally , fetching several hundred dollars . Ray Dapkus of Hartford , Conn. , says selling at Brimfield is more hobby than serious business . He has a tent jammed with kitschy " junk " that often stops baby boomers in their tracks . " Oh , we used to have one of these " is a familiar refrain as browsers spy objects like a picnic jug , table hockey game , and an outmoded vacuum cleaner . For those designing with a ' 50s motif , tacky sells . " The more outlandish the better , " Mr. Dapkus says pointing to a pair of lime-green , genie lamps connected by a planter . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure serves as a central tenet for flea markets . They supposedly were inspired by Le Marche aux Puces , a Parisian market that sold flea-infested sofas . Today , the antique-oriented flea markets are more sophisticated than they once were , says decorator Rachel Ashwell ( see story at left ) . " They are much more expensive than they used to be , " she says , " but people put their things together now , quite often in a vignette form instead of leaving it as a pile of stuff you have to sort through . They 've thought about it and possibly restored things , which is why prices are higher . " Another factor possibly pushing prices higher , says Emelie Tolley , is " Antiques Roadshow , " a popular public-television program that does on-the-air appraisals . Coauthor with Chris Mead of the forthcoming book " Flea Market Style : Decorating With an Edge , " Ms. Tolley says the show has raised expectations of antique values , sometimes unrealistically . It 's become harder to find " good things , " she says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's also convinced that a corresponding growth in home decorating know-how is making for better flea-market shoppers . " People have really developed a lot more confidence in their own taste , " she says . This has led to more eclectic and innovative decorating . Part of the fun of attending flea markets is imagining the possibilities . An old window becomes a mirror frame , a rusty watering can a flower pot , and a jelly jar a pencil holder . A transplanted New Englander , Holly Harris , has been delighted to find that California is fertile ground for secondhand shopping . " So many people buy new , buy bigger , buy better , buy often , and they discard things just as easily , " says the editor of Rummaging Through Northern California , a Bay Area newspaper . Her collection of used appliances attests to that . She picked up a practically new Cuisinart food processor for $ 5 . It did n't work , but the company sent her a new one because it was under warranty . Of course , everybody wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few are disappointed even if they do n't find the stuff of their dreams . " There 's always something , " Tolley says , " even if it 's just another bowl for the kitchen or a lighting fixture that needs repair . It almost does n't matter . " <p> TIPS FOR FLEA-MARKET SHOPPING * Be prepared to spend a lot of time looking and comparing . The search and socializing are part of the fun . * Think about how you 're going to get purchases home . Vendors do n't deliver . * Take paint samples , fabrics , and room measurements . * Study price guides and other sources in order to assess current values and condition . * Negotiate , but do n't make an offer so low that it cuts off discussion . A 20 percent price adjustment is not unusual . * Selection is best early in the day , but the best deals often occur near quitting time . * Look beyond an item 's normal use . A milk pail could become a lamp base , a game board a wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't carry around large purchases . Ask dealers to hold them until you 're ready to leave . This may mean leaving a deposit . <p> WHERE TO SHOP * Flea Market Guide of US Flea Markets Contains state-by-state directory of flea markets . www.fleamarketguide.com * Rummaging Through Northern California Focused on the Bay Area , but an informative site on buying secondhand items . www.sonic.net/ rtnc/ P.O.
