<p> What brought us to Atlanta ? Well , Daddy was looking for a job . Back in those days you had to go find you one somewhere . <p> I went to E.A. Ware school , and then Washington High . I did n't finish high school . I came out to help my mother , because she had gotten sick . I did n't feel bad about leaving school . I feel bad now , but I did n't feel bad in those days because Mama got sick , and she was n't able to work and somebody had to . Of course , the rent was n't but $ 2 a month , and the food was n't anything . So you could get by on $ 5 a month easy , and have plenty . <p> Most of the time during the summer months while growing up , I 'd go swimming . I loved to swim . I was a lifeguard at Washington Park for two years . All of us would meet over there . Back in those days , Martin Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow had a place up there and he 'd rent horses on Sunday . And we would go over there and rent a horse and go horseback riding , right around here in the city . There was n't no cars like there is now . I was about 17 years old then . <p> I remember when I started dating ; I was trying to be a big shot . I would get a cab and take my girl to the theater and take her to dinner and would n't even spend a dollar . You could go into the theater for 10 cents and get a dinner for 10 cents . That 's about all we done outside of going to the park . <p> Back in those days and times when he was a child , I remember working around the grocery store . It was n't a job . But people would give you a nickel for carrying groceries . You could get a hot dog for three cents back in those days . <p> In my lifetime , I only had two jobs . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing for that . I worked at Jacobs drugstore , I rode a bicycle for $ 3 a week and delivered things , and then they took me off the bike and put me in the store as a porter , mopping and cleaning up , and during the lunch hour I had to work behind the soda fountain washing dishes . Really , that 's where I met my next boss , and I started working for him . <p> I started off cleaning yards for him , and I moved up a little at a time , and the first thing I knew I was the chauffeur . And after World War II , he put me at the bank . I 'd weigh the mail and go to the post office about three times a day and look in the box and see what was in there . Maybe they would have a letter . <p> I wish I was just coming into the world now . I believe in another 50 years there are going to be a whole lot more changes made . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be no porter in a drugstore and I would n't be no chauffeur . I would , maybe , do like Andrew Young . I might run for the governor of Georgia . <p> Ed Bowen , 42 , the son of a teacher , grew up in several Atlanta neighborhoods . He is a businessman in Atlanta . <p> Atlanta was really enjoyable for me as a kid . When I was growing up , particularly when I lived on Simpson Street , there were a lot of things for us to do . I lived several blocks from what was called Hunter and Ashby . It was a real vibrant commercial area where there was a drugstore , a five and dime , a movie theater , and my uncle had a restaurant on that street . I was able to walk up there and go to the movie theater . <p> The only Downtown theater that we could go to was the Fox , and you had to walk up the back stairs of the Fox and sit in the balcony to see the newer released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the Ashby Theater and see the regular movies . There was the Butler Street YMCA nearby and a public park we called Washington Park , and both those facilities offered camps during the summer , so there were always things to do . <p> It was n't just your mother and father . You had uncles and aunts and grandparents and you had teachers from the community that we lived in . Everybody kind of looked out for one another . You always hear people say that , but it was really true . You could n't do too much wrong and it not get back to the house by the time you got to the house . <p> I knew that Atlanta was segregated , because when I would go to the Downtown Rich 's department store , they had colored and white water fountains , and I remember the same thing in the restrooms . Because there were so many things in the community where I lived that I could buy and do without having to go Downtown , I really was n't faced with the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in high school in the late ' 60s , when Atlanta started integrating the high schools and we started playing predominantly white schools , then it became a real issue because there were certain racial slurs on both sides . When I was growing up , Southwest High School was predominantly white . When our high school played Southwest , it was a confrontation on the court , and a confrontation in the stands . And I just remember some people pulled guns , and there was a threat of shooting and things of that nature . That always stuck out in my mind . <p> Joy Ballard , 32 , grew up on a timber plantation in southwest Georgia . SHe lives with her husband and two children in suburban Fayette County . ' Part of me was raised in 19th century ' <p> My daddy is a pharmacist and Mama and Daddy have a drugstore . I lived eight miles out in the country . I hardly know how to describe this , it 's so alien to the suburban lifestyle . I grew up in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1930s , and up the road was the house where my granddaddy grew up , which was built in 1864 . We did not have the concept of the nuclear family , we had the extended family . <p> I 'm a statistic . In 1980 , I was a Randolph County resident . Between 1980 and 1990 , Randolph County lost the most people , and Fayette County gained the most . We 've still got a couple of thousand acres of land down there , but the reason we 're here instead of there is because Scott her husband can make a good living here . It 's hard to make a living there . The businesses are closing like crazy . It 's very sad . <p> On our place , there are just tons of little empty , fallen-in houses . They were tenant farmer houses where people lived with our family and farmed , and they 're gone . In Cuthbert , the buildings on the square are empty . We had one really nice department store , it was a lovely place , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months ago . It 's just empty . <p> I was a cheerleader in high school , but we lived 20 miles from the school . I gather here that you stayed after school and you had activities . But there you had to get your ride home or you 'd have to take somebody home . Whatever you got done got done in the school day . I would go home , and before I could drive , I took long walks and rode my horse , and you know , I read . I 'm very well read ! <p> In high school , we did things like we 'd go to Albany and Columbus and if you wanted to go to a McDonalds , we had to go to Eufala , Ala . It 's almost like part of me lived in the ' 90s and part of me was raised in the 19th century . But we thought that was normal . <p> I think my children are getting the absolute best of both worlds . They 're getting to live here and go to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I was at 18 . He 's around people of different religious and ethnic backgrounds . He gets to do all the suburban things and gets to go down there once a month and have the things I had - the woods and the swamp and the wildlife and just the wonderful things of living in the country without the isolation and the drawbacks . But part of me is sad that they 're having such a different life . <p> Rick Bell , 38 , grew up in an Orlando suburb and in Spartanburg , S.C . He lives in Buckhead and works for Coca-Cola . " I see myself as a New Southerner " <p> We grew up in central Florida . At that time Florida was kind of a sleepy little place . It was orange groves and an interstate highway cutting through there . It was before Disney , and it was a great place to be a kid . I had one brother , he 's three years younger than I am . My father worked in various kinds of sales positions as I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part a housewife . It was sort of like Ward and June Cleaver . We moved to Spartanburg when I was about 15 . <p> For a brief time , my brother and I went to school in North Carolina ; we were living in the Charlotte area at the time . They were having riots , and we both had that experience . I was in about the 10th grade , and he would have been in the seventh grade . We had always , in one way or another , experienced friendships with black children , so to be sort of thrust into this busing and racial thing in Charlotte was really frightening and confusing and frustrating , all at the same time . <p> My father , he came from a very large South Georgia family from down around Leesburg and Americus , Ga . Visits to the farm were always an interesting experience . It was n't the Old South , but it was the rural South , where a lot of those kinds of traditions carry on . To be around the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people they had working for them , that was all different to me , I was sort of a city boy . But it was a part of my family heritage and history , and I was always engaged by it . <p> I was in the Kappa Alpha fraternity in college , a frat that was founded in the Reconstruction Era in the South by four people who were interested in continuing the cause of chivalry and respect for women and you know , your elders from whence you came , and polite and courteous manners and those kinds of things . It does connect to the way I was brought up , because it was the first opportunity , in my own right , to pick up what I had learned and carry it forward into what was becoming my own life . <p> I see myself as a New Southerner , with a lifestyle that is different , and the nature of my work is very different - I 'm constantly moving places and that in itself sort of flies in the face of the whole kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts . I think I have sort of taken from that experience what I can use , and I am new version of what is Southern . <p> Rebecca Frazer , 78 , grew up in Atlanta 's Druid Hills , the daughter of a Citizens &; Southern bank president , She lives today in Buckhead . ' Life was much more structured ' <p> In the culture that I was brought up in , a young girl was expected to finish high school and maybe go away to what they called finishing school . It was most unusual if we went to college . <p> In Atlanta it was considered a very lovely social privilege to be invited to be a member of the debutante club . So , the girls in my group that were eligible , or able to do so , made their debut . It was the Atlanta Debutante Club , the only debutante club that Atlanta had . There were only about 20 girls that were in that group , and you spent the whole year going to parties . This sounds very frivolous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men always went to college . It was very stylish among Atlanta 's young men to go to Georgia Tech and Emory and maybe to the University of Georgia . After the boys got out of college , they took any kind of job they could get . People did not go and get MBAs and expect to be hired at a fancy salary . You got a job on a Coca-Cola truck delivering Cokes around , or wherever you could get a job , and a job was a job , and you were expected to work your way up . <p> Life was much more structured than it is now . I do n't think it 's structured at all now , from what I can figure out . We always had breakfast together at the same time and different people came home at different times in the afternoon , but for dinner at night you were expected to come in when you were called to dinner , and the bell rang and everybody came to the table and sat down at the same time and had the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the butler served the meal . I think that was true in many middle-or upper-class homes . <p> The only place you went to go shopping was down on Peachtree Street . We called that going to town , and you put on a hat and gloves and you dressed properly . You never went to town without a hat and gloves and dressed in a nice dress . You had resorty kind of clothes that you wore for tennis or golf or outings , but you never appeared on the street in that type of dress after you reached a certain age . <p> For dates , we would go to a movie and stop at a drugstore on the way home or at a drive-in like the Varsity Junior where you honk your horn . We would do that at the corner drugstore . You pull in to the curb and have curb service . You would honk your horn and get a Coke with cherry or lime . We called them dope - get a dope on your way home .
