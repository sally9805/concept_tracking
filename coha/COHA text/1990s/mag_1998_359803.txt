Before he gave up power to a democratically elected government in 1990 , former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet Ugarte erected a legal fortress around himself . His 17 years of iron-fisted , right-wing military rule had been blamed for the death or disappearance of 3,400 suspected communists and leftists , not to mention the torture of thousands of others . With that legacy hanging over his head , Pinochet rammed through an array of constitutional measures that made him immune to prosecution , including a lifetime Senator 's seat that he took amid widespread protest last March , when he retired as an army general . " The locks and bolts made him untouchable , " says Christian Democratic Congressman Andres Palma . " And he believed they would accompany him wherever he went in the world . " <P> They did n't . Late last Friday night , while still recovering from surgery in London for a herniated disc , Pinochet , 82 , was awakened by police and told that he was under arrest . A Spanish court , which has been trying Pinochet in absentia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chile in the 1970s , had issued an extradition warrant days earlier . Scotland Yard detectives said Pinochet , who is being held at the London Clinic , would eventually appear at an extradition hearing before a British magistrate . The move stunned Pinochet 's boosters and critics alike , making it clear that the wounds caused by his regime are as open as ever . Waking to the news last Saturday morning , the families of Pinochet 's victims in Santiago declared that his arrest had " broken the cycle of impunity . " <P> That might be a premature verdict , however . As a Chilean Senator , Pinochet was traveling with a diplomatic passport . Though the government of Chile 's President , Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle , is hardly a Pinochet ally , it had little choice but to protest formally " what it considers a violation of the diplomatic immunity that Senator Pinochet enjoys , " and demanded " an early end of this situation . " But the British Foreign Office argued that such immunity would apply only if Pinochet had been on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were scrambling to determine if his visit had any official purpose beyond his operation at London Bridge Hospital . <P> In Chile almost half the citizenry still revere Pinochet as a strong leader who saved the nation from economic and political collapse after his bloody U.S.-backed 1973 coup , in which leftist President Salvador Allende was killed . Since becoming a Senator , he has tried to project a more benign , grandfatherly image . But in countries like the U.S. , where Pinochet assassins executed one of his exiled opponents in 1976 , he 's unlikely to get much sympathy . " The international community is sending a very positive signal for democracy and human rights , " says Palma . Retired Chilean army General Luis Cortes Villa , head of the Pinochet Foundation , called the London arrest " an act of cowardice " for rousting Pinochet out of bed at midnight in his frail condition . Perhaps , but compared with the brutal days of Pinochet 's rule , it seemed civilized enough . <P>  --  By Tim Padgett .
