Meserak ( Mimi ) Ramsey 's eyes fill with tears as she recalls a routine gynecological checkup in a Los Angeles doctor 's office two years ago . At 41 , she had known for some time that the pain she often felt around her genital area was related to a specific traumatic event in her childhood . But until then she had not allowed herself to confront the meaning of that even or its impact on her life . Right in the middle of the exam , the doctor stood up and looked at her . " Who did this to you " Who did this to you ? " he repeated over and over . Ramsey , who had never talked about the genital mutilation that occurred when she was six years old  --  not to her two husbands ; not to her nursing colleagues ; and not to her mother , who had chosen to have her mutilated  --  sat down with the doctor and poured it all out . Afterward , the best he could do was send her away with a cream to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to pray . She prayed for guidance , trying to imagine what she could do to protect other girls and women , not only in Ethiopia , her homeland where she was mutilated , but in all the countries of the world where female genital mutilation ( FGM ) is practiced . That included , she knew , Western countries like the United States , England , and France , where immigrant groups have brought the practice with them . In what other may see as a remarkable coincidence , and Ramsey sees as something of a miracle , she turned on the television that night to a news program that featured a discussion of FGM . During the program , Representative Patricia Schroeder ( D.-Colo. ) was interviewed as the sponsor of several bills aimed at eliminating FGM in the U.S. ( The bills , which were defeated in a previous session of Congress , have been reintroduced in the House by Schroeder and by Harry Reid D.-Nev. in the Senate . At press time , they were still pending . ) The next day , Ramsey got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew in the United States . She asked each on if they too had been mutilated . In nearly every case  --  and she called 90 women  --  the answer was " yes . " " Let 's talk about what 's been done to use " she said to each of them , hoping that by beginning a dialogue , the women might turn around and work to prevent the next generation of girls from being harmed . Next , Ramsey called Schroeder 's office , which referred her to Equality Now , a New York-based human rights organization working to eliminate FGM . Mimi Ramsey is one of more than 100 million living women and girls who have undergone genital mutilation . This involves partial or total removal of the clitoris ; removal of the clitoris and labia minora ; or removal of all external genitalia and the stitching together of the two sides of the vulva , leaving only a small vaginal opening . Current estimates are that 2 million girls are maimed each year , with 10,000 at risk in the United States . Immigrant " circumcisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know where to find one when the time comes . If they ca n't find one , some families may band together to bring a " circumciser " from their homeland to do a group of girls at one time . Since that day two years ago , Ramsey has devoted herself to the monumental task of stopping FGM around the world , through education and personal entreaties . That means she will drop everything at a moment 's notice to speak to someone in person or by phone who may be considering mutilating their daughter . It was Equality Now that arranged for her to spend one month training in London with Forward , an international organization dedicated to assisting women who have been mutilated , and to eradicating FGM through laws and education . So far , Forward has helped in getting FGM legally banned in Sweden , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom . After her training , Ramsey took her savings and an unpaid leave from her nursing job and went home to Ethiopia , which she had left 22 years earlier as a 19-year-old bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the traumas of FGM was her own mother . " I asked her , ' If you loved me , how could you let this happen to me ? ' " Ramsey recalls . " My mother answered by saying her own mother had pressured her . I looked at her and said , ' Who is my mother ? You or my grandmother ? ' " Shocked , her mother begged her forgiveness , and asked what she could do to make things right . Ramsey responded by asking her mother to go door-to-door with her in their neighborhood , talking to parents , trying to save other girls . So mother and daughter set out , going to homes where they knew the families had young girls . " My mother would knock on a door and say , ' Excuse me , my daughter is angry with me and I must make it right . ' " Then the two of them would sit down and explain to the parents why they should not mutilate their daughters . At that point , Ramsey would do most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , menstruation , intercourse , and childbirth ; the risk of infection and even death ( one of Ramsey 's childhood friends bled to death after being mutilated ) ; the dangers during childbirth ; and the terrible psychic scar that accompanies the physical one . Ramsey believes they saved at least 20 girls that day . Ramsey returned to the U.S. to continue her efforts to eliminate FGM . She has reduced her full-time schedule as a psychiatric nurse in Santa Clara , California , to devote her time to her advocacy work . She spends several days a week traveling , often at her own expense , to cities with large African populations . Once there , she will pore through telephone books , looking for businesses that might be African-owned . She visits restaurants , beauty salons , garages  --  any gathering place she can find  --  trying with her quiet voice , gleaming eyes , and gentle manner to reassure parents that they do not need to harm their daughters . Often someone will mention a young girl who is in danger , and Ramsey will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begin her story again . Usually , she says , the mothers can quickly be persuaded ; fathers and grandparents are more reluctant to break with tradition . But Ramsey persists , explaining to families that FGM could be considered a crime in this country . As yet , it is not , but they are surprised nonetheless . One thing she does not often say , but sincerely believes , is that her mutilation was just one manifestation of the many brutal ways in which patriarchy tries to control women . She believes this because she lived for two years with an extremely violent husband , a man who , as he beat her , accused her of being frigid  --  never acknowledging that his rage and her mutilation had contributed to her lack of sexual feelings . Once , while Ramsey was pregnant , her husband , who was a law student at Stanford University , threw out all the food in their house and disappeared for a month , leaving her with no money . Relatively new to the U.S. at the time , she had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ramsey survived by picking grass from the university 's lawns and boiling it into soup . Ramsey says misogyny such as her first husband 's has the same cultural roots as FGM . " The reason for my mutilation is for a man to be able to control me , to make me a good wife : make his bed , wash his clothes , prepare his food in the perfect way , give him children . It is to keep me in line . " Eventually a neighbor helped Ramsey and her infant son escape to Los Angeles , where Ramsey knew some people . There she found a job cleaning at a convalescent center and eventually worked her way through nursing school . During that time , she divorced and remarried . Her new husband was an American who was gentle and loving , but when he began to ask tentative questions about her mutilation , Ramsey was too embarrassed to talk about it . She told him that she had been hurt in an automobile accident as a child . Her inability to enjoy sexual relations ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her former husband remain friends . Now , with her son grown , Ramsey has the time and the abiding passion to focus on little more than FGM . She has become one of the most important crusaders in the U.S. against the barbarism of genital mutilation  --  so effective because she has suffered all the terrible things she is trying to prevent . Because she has lived through what she is talking about , when someone says , " It is not so bad , " or " It is a normal , necessary practice , " Ramsey can look them in the eye and tell them they are wrong . Looking back on her long , painful history , and forward to the work she will continue to do for the rest of her life , Ramsey sums it all up quite simply : " When women are hurting , everyone suffers .

Some of them are pretty standard ; others might be all my own . Now and then I get a new one ; I do n't know how this happens . It just shows up one day , like a moth hole in a sweater . But , though new ones come , the old ones never go away . They just accumulate . <p> Most of the time I do n't mind my superstitions . I actually sort of like them ; they 're like tiny warning signs that help me navigate the real and imagined dangers of the day . Sometimes , though , I wish my superstitions were n't there . It would be nice to believe that life and people are more reasonable than that . But life is n't , and people are n't , and that 's just how it is . <p> On the day that set the stage for my association with Robert Maxx , I woke up at an unlucky time . Given my line of work , I rarely have to be anyplace special in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the old saying goes , habits are the shackles of the free , and my habits shackle me plenty . Alarm clock or no , I almost always wake up between 7 and 7:30 . That morning , I cracked an eye and the first thing I saw was 7:13 . <p> I slammed my eyes shut quickly , but not so fast that I could kid myself that I had n't seen the dreaded number . I lay in bed until I was sure that at least a full minute had passed , then I knocked wood to counteract the effect of having seen the inauspicious digits , and only then did I get up . <p> Considering the lousy start , the morning went okay . I made coffee , read the paper , pissed around with a little essay about the creative use of boredom . Then the phone rang . Before I answered it , I looked down at the clock in the bottom corner of the computer screen . It was 10:13 . What were the odds ? <p> The call was from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been together for a dozen years , through thick and thin , though most of the thick part was a while ago . What I cherish and admire about Paul is his ability to live and function in a constant and unremitting state of unspoken conflict . At heart , my agent is a profound pessimist , a man of serene dejection whose worldly disillusionment is so thoroughly ingrained as to seem almost French . He knows deep down that most books wo n't sell , that reviewers will generally be invidious and snide , that publishers will often break promises . He accepts these things without umbrage or surprise . At the same time , in his role as a salesman , a peddler of goods , he has no choice but to be cheery , optimistic , upbeat , to do that whole Willy Loman thing complete with the smile and the shoeshine . He 's very good at this , and I have no idea how he does it . His looks probably help . He 's got sandy , reddish hair and a scattering of yachtsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early forties , he could pass for twenty-eight . <p> In any case , I looked away from the computer clock , knocked wood again , and said hello . <p> " David , " Paul said , " got a minute ? I just had an interesting call from Marcie Kanin over at Porter . " <p> My ears perked up . I 've known Paul long enough to understand that the word interesting in this context is his code for the possibility of money changing hands . It 's not a usage I 'd heard very often lately . " Talk to me , " I said . <p> " She wanted to know if you 're available . I played it coy , let her think you might be drowning in offers . " <p> I said , " Maybe I would be if I had a better agent . " <p> " You might be drowning . But it would n't be in offers . You know Marcie ? " <p> I did n't , which was actually surprising . Publishing is a small village , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once too many times , you 'll pretty much meet everybody , generally over lunches that are all the same . They start with rather stilted chitchat before looking at the menu , then move on to a main course of industry gossip and schadenfreude , which leads in due course to that deflating moment over demitasse when editor and writer gaze hopefully at each other and realize more or less simultaneously that the other has not brought a brilliant book idea to the table . <p> " Well , no matter , " Paul said . " You 'll like her . She 's a grown-up and a survivor . And she just got into business with Robert Maxx . " He put an almost salacious breathiness into the mention of the name , then let it hang suspended for a moment . <p> If I was supposed to be instantly impressed , I was n't . " Robert Maxx ? Oh , great . There 's a prestige project . Musings of a fucking egomaniac parvenu with an infantile obsession about putting his name on buildings . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David , " he said , " Robert Maxx 's name recognition is right up there with the president 's . He can get on Oprah with a phone call . Larry King begs him to appear . " <p> " Okay . Big celebrity . But he does schmucky business books . Crap for middle managers and neo-yuppies . I do n't want to do that . Get some hack from BusinessWeek . " <p> " Marcie does n't want just any hack . She wants a hack who can tell a story . " <p> " Is that supposed to be flattering ? " <p> " I 've done some homework . Over the last twenty years , Maxx has published half a dozen books , each one with a different ghost . They 've all been bestsellers , but every one has sold fewer copies than the last . What does that say to you ? " <p> " For starters , " I said , " it tells me he 's either a real dick to work with or impossible to please . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not the point . The point is that there 's magic in his name . Always has been , always will be . But the straight business-book vein was tapped out years ago . Marcie wants this to be a different kind of book .
