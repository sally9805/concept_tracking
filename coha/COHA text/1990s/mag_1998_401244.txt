This humble organ is self-maintaining and cleaning . But when something does go wrong , fixes are simple and easy . // A few years ago , I took a plane from New York to Miami -a three-hour trip that will forever be referred to as the Flight from Hell . Things began smoothly enough , but as the plane climbed higher and higher , so did the pressure in my head . I 'd had a sinus infection the week before but never dreamed that a little congestion could cause such excruciating pain . I spent the entire flight trying every ear-clearing trick I knew-chewing gum , munching ice cubes , yawning , pinching my nostrils and exhaling with my mouth closed-all to no avail . Even the descent provided no relief ; in fact , the pressure in my head only intensified . By the time we were on the ground , I was sniveling like a toddler and checking train schedules for my return trip . The moral of this story ? Ears are not to be trifled with . IN ONE EAR ... Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They go about their business without much fuss or fanfare-they 're even self-cleaning . But the ear is a complex structure , connected to your respiratory system via the sinuses and responsible for such important duties as regulating pressure , draining mucous and other secretions and facilitating your hearing . Because the tissues in the ear are also very sensitive , any trauma-an infection , a blow to the head , a very loud noise , buildup of ear wax or an overzealous cleaning with a cotton swab-can lead to irritation and intense pain . Sounds get into your head through the ear canal , which leads to the eardrum , a membrane that vibrates in response to noise . Behind the eardrum is the Eustachian tube , which connects to the back of the sinus cavity . The Eustachian tube serves as a drain for the inner ear as well as a chamber for equalizing the pressure within your head with the outside atmosphere . When it 's slightly congested , you 'll feel pressure or a mild popping in your ears . When it 's really blocked off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your head is about to explode . Photograph // The most common problems associated with the ears are a buildup of wax , which can cause discomfort and even mild hearing loss , and infections-especially in children , whose shorter tubes make them far more susceptible than adults . Here 's what you can do when pain strikes . ... AND OUT THE OTHER The ear canal is naturally coated with a thin film of wax , which traps dust and other debris that could get into the inner ear and lead to infection or physical damage . Ear wax serves a definite purpose , so you should n't try too hard to eradicate it , says Carolyn DeMarco , M.D. , a holistic physician in Toronto . " Wax prevents infection , and naturally forms into flakes and falls out on its own , " she says . But if your ears are n't ridding themselves of all the wax they produce , they might feel itchy or stuffed up , and you might notice that your hearing is n't what it used to be . In that case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You should never use cotton swabs to clean out the ear canal , " advises Keri Rollins , D.O. , an osteopathic doctor and director of the Wellness Center in Fort Worth , Texas . " Swabs just mash the wax into the ear and cause it to become impacted , which can create more problems . " She recommends a peroxide solution rinse instead . Mix a teaspoon of any hydrogen peroxide with a few tablespoons of warm water . Tilt your head to one side , then , using a small bulb syringe ( available at any drug store ) , squirt the solution into your ears and let it drain . ( It 's a good idea to have an absorbant paper towel handy . ) Other practitioners suggest putting a few drops of oil into each ear before rinsing ; the oil will attract the wax particles and make them easier for the warm water to flush away . You can buy herbal drops made specially for your ears or use a plain vegetable oil . An even simpler solution , says Robert Rakowski , M.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to gently insert an olive oil-soaked cotton ball into each ear at bedtime . In the morning , remove the cotton . The wax will have been drawn into the oil , so you can easily wipe it away . Ear candling is a popular but controversial alternative . In this ancient tradition , you lie on your side and a trained practitioner inserts a special beeswax taper into your ear , then lights it to create a vacuum that pulls out excess wax . Recently , the Food and Drug Administration forced one manufacturer of ear candles to halt distribution , citing complaints of burns . Rollins says she is n't convinced of candling 's effectiveness . " Most of what comes out is the wax from the candle itself , not earwax , " she maintains . " Cleaning with a syringe is much more effective-and it 's definitely safer . " NOT ANOTHER INFECTION ! Among young children , the most common ear problem is infections . In fact , it 's the No. 1 reason for pediatric visits and costs the nation an estimated $4 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otitis media , which is a middleear infection involving the Eustachian tube , and otitis externa , an outer-ear infection involving the ear canal . Otitis externa is often called swimmer 's ear , as it 's caused by bacteria breeding in water that 's left in the ear canal after swimming or bathing . In babies and kids , the Eustachian tube is smaller and more likely to become blocked . It 's also almost perfectly horizontal , making it tougher to drain and setting it up for infection , explains David Schwindt , M.D. , a holistic physician in Albuquerque , N.M . As we age , the Eustachian tube becomes more angled and better able to keep itself free of fluid buildup . Instead of a structural problem , an adult 's otitis media can often be blamed on an infection in the sinuses , says Robert Ivker , D.O. , an osteopathic physician in Littleton , Colo. , and president of the American Holistic Medical Association . When the sinus tissues become inflamed , they push against the Eustachian tube , which fills with mucous and fluid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently caused by food allergies , although this cause is largely overlooked among conventional medical practitioners . According to Michael A. Schmidt , visiting professor of applied biochemistry and clinical nutrition at Northwestern College in Bloomington , Minn. , the food that causes the most allergies and sensitivity is dairy . Other common triggers are chocolate , wheat , eggs , citrus , sugar , yeast , soy and corn . " Responses are dose-related , meaning that some people can tolerate a food occasionally , but they have problems if they get too much , " he says . If you , or , more likely , your child are getting chronic ear infections , one of the simplest things you could do is eliminate dairy and see if the problem goes away , Schmidt says . If dairy does n't seem to be the offender , look at the other foods you 're eating consistently . ( Food sensitivities and allergies often involve more than one food , he adds , so do n't conclude your investigation after you 've found one trigger . ) In addition , Schmidt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function and exacerbate inflammation . Of course , conventional pediatricians will almost immediately put a child with an ear infection on antibiotics-without bothering to check if the infection is caused by bacteria ( and only about half are ) . On top of that , antibiotics have a tendency to build up bacteria 's resistance and lead to recurrent , and often chronic , infections . The trick is to get to the cause of the problem . " If we believe that the body can heal itself , then there are two ways we can treat any patient , " Rakowski continues . " One , remove anything that is stressful to their system . And two , build their resistance . " Rakowski suggests taking astragalus or echinacea , herbs with proven immuneboosting powers . Look for tinctures or whole-herb preparations , and take a dose three times a day during an infection ( follow label instructions ) . Many people , and practitioners , have had great success treating ear infections with homeopathic remedies . Jennifer Jacobs , M.D. , a family practitioner and homeopath outside Seattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the most amenable to homeopathic remedies . " To prescribe the right homeopathic remedy , a doctor evaluates an individual 's symptoms as well as his or her personality , explains Miranda Castro , a homeopath in Seattle and author of several books , including The Complete Homeopathy Handbook ( St. Martin 's Press , 1990 ) . " Each person has their own unique way of expressing everything , from creativity to emotions to disease , " she says . " Homeopaths do n't treat earaches , we treat people with earaches . " If you 've got recurring earaches , do not treat yourself , " continues Castro . " Go to a practitioner and get what 's called a constitutional treatment , where you 'll discuss your medical history and all your other symptoms . But if this is the first earache you 've ever had , or it 's the first one in five years , then have a go . " Here are her suggestions for easy-to-self-prescribe remedies ( available at most natural food stores ) along wtih the primary symptoms they treat . Aconite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill . Belladonna : Severe throbbing pain ; child is oversensitive and cranky . Chamomilla : Unbearable pain ; fever ; child is impatient and angry . Lycopodium : Pain on right side only ; stopped-up nose ; cold extremities . Magnesia phosphorica ( or " homeopathic aspirin " ) : Pain reduced by the application of heat or pressure . Mercurius solubilis : Pain accompanied by swollen glands and sweating . Pulsatilla : Red and swollen external ear ; this one is good for most infections . For any of these remedies , Castro says to take a 12C dose every one to two hours ( or as often as every 30 minutes if the earache is very painful ) . Give the remedy about six doses to work ; if you do n't see results , try another . Stop taking the remedy when you see marked improvement .

To treat an active infection , rinse the ears three times a day with a solution of baking soda , which will correct the pH , says Schwindt . Dissolve a teaspoon into a cup of water , then use a few tablespoons to rinse out your ears with the syringe . Next use a few drops of a natural antimicrobial agent , like tea tree oil or garlic or grapefruit seed extract , diluted in a few teaspoons of olive oil ( you also can buy prepared ear drops ) . Lie on your side or tilt your head and drip the oil into your ears , several times a day . And to help your body fight the infection , take echinacea or astragalus , as directed above . .
