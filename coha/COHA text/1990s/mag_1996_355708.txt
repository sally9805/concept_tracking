A first debate is like a first date  --  it 's the one people remember . That 's why the preparation for it is so intense . The White House suggested that Bill Clinton was " cramming " for his first encounter with Bob Dole . The challenger , for his part , spent most of the week at his condo in Bal Harbour , Florida , reading briefing books and scanning the cloudy skies for beneficial rays . ( On Friday he gave up and opted for a sun lamp . ) <P> In picture-book Chautauqua , New York , for each of three evenings before the debate , Clinton held a mock session with smooth-talking former Senator George Mitchell , who played Dole . The main advice to Clinton : Do n't let Dole drag you off the presidential pedestal , stay on your sunny message and do n't bite your lip . Dole rehearsed in the first-floor ballroom of his condominium building , where the campaign set up a stage bathed in TV lights . Aides sat at a table to the side , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was former actor and good ole boy Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson . Dole was getting advice from so many people that one suggested too many cooks were at work . Main advice to Dole : Be relaxed , listen to the questions and try to pin Clinton down . And do n't glower.
