In the shadow of New Mexico 's Sangre de Cristo Mountains , a buck with a velvet rack picks his way across a steep hillside , followed by three does . Hearing a noise , the deer turn toward a meadow filled with oak trees and sunflowers that glisten like gold coins . A band of backpacking Boy Scouts stare wide-eyed at this moment of natural theater . <P> The scouts are from Troop 501 in La Canada-Flintridge , Calif. , a suburb of Los Angeles . They 've begun the first day of a trek at Philmont Scout Ranch , the 215-sq. - mi. wilderness near Cimarron , N. Mex. , that is scouting 's premier " high adventure " base . Months of training hikes , equipment checks and dieting for obese adult advisers have preceded this day . The hikers will trudge through dense forests , up and over 10,000-ft. mountain passes , pelted by daily thundershowers . Staff members at backcountry camps are decked out as miners , trappers and other frontier characters to provide history lessons and entertainment . The trek 's success is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish as a tight team in step with its weakest hikers . <P> Nationally , scouting faces an equally rugged journey . Like the 17,500 hikers who passed through Philmont this past summer , the highly traditional movement has been forced in recent years to shed some flab and check its compass . Static enrollments five years ago persuaded the national office in Irving , Texas , to commission a marketing study , which concluded that the Boy Scouts were dangerously out of step with post-1960s America ; the public still imagined uniformed do-gooders who tie knots and help old folks across the street . One solution : the Scout Handbook was revised to show more minority scouts in action and offer advice on such off-campground problems as AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases , child abuse and how to resist sexual molesters . <P> A Philmont trek provides a deceptively casual scenario for such transition . Changing history is evident in the area 's visitors . Spanish conquistadores and American pioneers passed through . Trekkers carrying side arms have included Kit Carson and , more recently , eagle scout and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In recent years women have become active in the formerly all-male backcountry . Two of 501 's adult leaders are female , as are 20 of Philmont 's 185 rangers who hike for two days with each group to help launch the trip successfully . Environmental pressures are being felt as well . While scouting enjoys a proud heritage of eco-awareness , Philmont was stunned to discover last year that its landfill violated New Mexico 's updated waste-management laws . As a result , camping garbage now has to be carted 60 miles to nearby Taos.
