Section : World report Critics say Russia 's gas monopoly is too cozy with the Kremlin <p> As his jet cruised over Siberia last summer , Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin held up a shot glass of vodka in a birthday toast to his longtime friend Rem Vyakhirev , chairman of Russia 's giant gas monopoly , Gazprom . " Za vas , za nas i za gas , " he said , in a little rhyme that translates as : " To you , to us and to gas . " <p> To Chernomyrdin and Vyakhirev , the toast reflects 30 years of work together in the natural gas industry . To their critics , it reflects something else : " Gazprom , " says one Western economist in Moscow , " is way too close to the government . " <p> By some measures , Gazprom is the richest private company on Earth . It controls one third of the world 's gas reserves , worth hundreds of billions of dollars . It has 367,000 employees , 87,000 miles of pipelines and more than 1 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $20 billion to $25 billion and its profits at $6 billion ; if it were ranked in the Global Fortune 500 , it would be the world 's second-biggest profit maker , after Royal Dutch Shell . <p> But those figures only hint at Gazprom 's importance to Russia 's economy and politics . It is the country 's single biggest taxpayer , adding more than $4 billion a year to government coffers . It is the alma mater and power base of Chernomyrdin , a possible successor to the ailing President Boris Yeltsin and the head of a political party , Our Home Is Russia , that will carry the government 's hopes in the December 17 parliamentary election . Gazprom is also one of the most effective instruments of Moscow 's foreign policy . Yet to many Russians , it is a scandalous example of how the nomenklatura  --  the old elite of the Communist system  --  has managed to hijack reforms , hold on to power and grow rich . <p> When Yeltsin went into the hospital with heart problems in October , U.S. State Department spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  meaning Chernomyrdin 's . Because Chernomyrdin , 57 , is a pragmatic moderate who supports market reforms and works closely on a bilateral commission with Vice President Al Gore , he is viewed in Washington as a force for stability and common sense in Russia 's tumultuous politics . <p> Very rich , very fast . Some Russians see him that way , too . But many also see him as the protector of the country 's industrial robber barons , men who have privatized companies , factories and even whole industries . " He represents the interests of a very small number of people who have monopolized the resources of the country and grown very rich , very fast , " says former Social Welfare Minister Ella Pamfilova . Russians have shown their skepticism toward Our Home Is Russia by nicknaming it Our Home Is Gazprom . The latest polls indicate it will attract only 14 percent of the votes for parliament . <p> Until three years ago , Chernomyrdin had spent his entire career in the oil and gas industry , rising from machinist to chairman of Gazprom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After Yeltsin tapped him to replace the radical reformer Yegor Gaidar as prime minister in late 1992 , Chernomyrdin picked Vyakhirev as his successor at Gazprom . <p> Today , Vyakhirev runs the Russian gas empire from a brand-new , 35-story Moscow office tower , part of a $200 million complex that includes a hotel , a bank and Gazprom 's own hospital . Security is tight ; about 300 guards and hundreds of closed-circuit cameras watch over 800 employees at headquarters . The elegant rooms of Vyakhirev 's suite are stuffed with mahogany furniture , malachite vases , an electric shoe polisher  --  and a direct phone to Chernomyrdin . <p> In a country where corruption is rife , close ties between politicians and big business are bound to raise suspicions . Opposition leaders allege that Chernomyrdin obtained 1 to 3 percent of Gazprom 's shares  --  worth more than $1 billion  --  when 60 percent of the company was privatized from 1991 to 1994 . They also charge that he has given Gazprom huge tax breaks and sweetheart prices on state property . But Gazprom and Chernomyrdin deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In an interview with U.S. News , Vyakhirev vowed on his life that Chernomyrdin does not own a single share of the company . " I will lay my head on this table , under an ax , if he does , " Vyakhirev said . Since the list of Gazprom 's shareholders is secret and Russian law does not require top officials to disclose their stock holdings , the public has no way to determine whether Vyakhirev 's head should roll . " No one really knows what 's going on there , " complains Sergei Alexashenko , a former deputy finance minister who says he tried last year , to no avail , to find out how Gazprom spent its export revenues . <p> Final say . Gazprom 's transformation from a state monopoly to a private company did not follow the normal rules for privatization in Russia . Formally , the government still owns 40 percent of the shares , but they are controlled by Vyakhirev . Most of the remaining shares were sold to employees and the public at auctions in remote gas industry towns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from selling shares ; all trades must be approved by the company . <p> " It 's a total farce . Either you privatize or you do n't , but you ca n't have your cake and eat it too , " says Miljenko Horvat , head of Citibank 's operations in Russia . <p> Vyakhirev argues that Gazprom is unfairly under attack from Chernomyrdin 's political enemies , who have " no other stick to beat him with . " Indeed , after being accused of favoring Gazprom , Chernomyrdin recently has made some high-profile decisions against the firm , including raising its excise taxes and blocking Gazprom 's attempt to buy a defense plant without competitive bids . <p> The company 's defenders say that breaking up the monopoly would kill the goose that lays the Kremlin 's golden eggs . The natural gas industry is the only major sector of the economy that has kept its production steady since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 . Natural gas exports to Europe are a critical source of foreign currency for Russia . <p> Moreover , Gazprom has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling Russian factories that together owe the company over $6 billion . This makes Gazprom a formidable political and diplomatic weapon . Russia has used the price and availability of gas to bring neighbors such as Ukraine , Georgia and Armenia to heel . " As Russia has fewer tools of influence , gas supplies have gained importance , " says Andrei Zobov , a policy analyst at the Carnegie Center in Moscow . <p> Private planes . Domestically , too , Gazprom is a power broker . Vyakhirev says the company provides financial and logistical support , such as transportation on its private planes , to parliamentary candidates from Chernomyrdin 's Our Home Is Russia party and other groups . He also confirms that Gazprom supports four major newspapers and is buying a 10 percent stake in Russia 's public television channel . <p> Gaidar , the former prime minister and architect of Russia 's market reforms , argues that the greatest danger to Russia 's economy today is the intertwining of private business and the government ; the success of an enterprise often depends on whether the manager pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " While no one has proved that Gazprom breaks the law , its tight Kremlin connections are held up by critics as a glaring example of what has gone wrong with Russian reform . <p> " The prime minister shares Vyakhirev 's view that what 's good for Gazprom is good for Russia , ' " says Citibank 's Horvat . " But it 's not good for the country that Gazprom is not changing faster . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Gazprom veteran . Chernomyrdin <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A Gazprom control room .
