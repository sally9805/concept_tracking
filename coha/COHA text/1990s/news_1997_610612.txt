<p> She fed , moved , wheedled and beguiled the multitudes with what was later described as " style and ingenuity , " " sleight of hand " and " dictatorial discipline . " And in the four-plus years Ann Stock was White House social secretary , none of her gutsier ways came in handier than when the Season to Be Jolly started up after Thanksgiving . <p> That , by tradition , is when several thousand of the First Family 's nearest and dearest are invited in for a round of holiday parties , often half a year in the making . Around the Clinton White House , they came to be known as " Christmases from Hell . " <p> What 's different about this jolly season is that Stock has a new job . Instead of a White House knee-deep in needlepoint ornaments , she is promoting a Kennedy Center wrapped up in red ribbons 10 feet wide . What is not different is that no matter where , what or how it 's celebrated , the holiday season is still Ann Stock 's thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandria home she shares with her husband , Stuart , a partner in the law firm of Covington &; Burling , and their son , Chase , a college freshman , there is always roast turkey on Thanksgiving and Christmas , always roast beef on Christmas Eve . Certain friends always bring the hors d'oeuvres , others always bring the pies . Stuart Stock always says grace , closing with a wry state-of-the world overview that is always wryly received . <p> With the exception of the turkey , which she refuses to eviscerate and which he stuffs with cornbread and apples marinated in bourbon , she always prepares the basics . Ann Stock never attempts to be fancy with the sweet potatoes , green beans , salad and cranberry sauce . This is traditional American fare . <p> " Thanksgiving dinner , " says Ann Stock , " may not change . " <p> Nor may Christmas Eve and Christmas Day dinners . CBS correspondent Rita Braver , a longtime friend , tells of offering to give the dinner one particularly hectic Christmas but being turned down because the Stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I said that of course I would have it catered  --  I 'm not out of my mind , " Braver remembers . " But Ann said , ' No . Chase has to have a home-cooked Christmas dinner . ' " <p> Some would call that Stock at her " dictatorial discipline " best . Under " style and ingenuity " would come her addiction to needlepoint , what she calls a " mindless but relaxing " activity that she has been doing behind the scenes for 20 years . <p> Back in the Eighties , when she was Bloomingdale 's vice president of public relations and spending three nights and five days each week in New York away from her family , she chalked up 700,000 Delta shuttle miles , and who knows how many needlepoint creations . <p> She can calculate vacations in needlepoint hours . She knows , for instance , that the family 's favorite Colorado dude ranch is a two-ornament round-trip flight . And lest she not know what to do with herself on a four-hour ride to see Chase at Duke University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her essential needlepoint gear . <p> Thanks to her cajoling , thousands of needlepoint ornaments from Christmases past are stashed away in the White House awaiting Clinton-era heirloom status a century from now . It was Stock who appealed to the patriotic instincts of needlepointers in every state to produce ornaments for the annual Blue Room trees . <p> They " roasted " her for it when she left the White House . Trumpets blared and military social aides stood at attention while Stock 's " sleight of hand " skills in snafu-solving , gatekeeping , event-organizing , etiquette-arbitration , ego-stroking , hand-holding and needlepoint-acquisition were recounted . <p> Yet for all her sleepless nights , 18-hour days and last-minute efforts to decorate her own Christmas tree and help Stuart hang his Williamsburg Apple Fan over their front door , never once did she hang what the Clintons called in their farewell proclamation " pornographic ornaments " on the White House tree . For that a grateful president and first lady canonized Stock the " Patron Saint of Needlepoint at the White House . " <p> Stock 's own needlepoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mayes clans . When her son was young , she made the entire series of Wizard of Oz , Twelve Days of Christmas and Nutcracker ornaments . To reassure Chase that his favorite stuffed bears and rabbit were at the top of Santa 's list , she made miniature stockings picturing Paddington Bear , Teddy Bear and Heather Bunny to hang next to the family 's stockings . <p> " If I ever die , I told Chase he can not give these away , " says Stock , who is not kidding . " Nobody is going to get these except my child . His wife can display them , but it 's a prenuptial agreement or nothing . " <p> Most are the designs of Hyla H. Hurley of The Point Of It All , a shop in Foxhall Square on New Mexico Avenue NW . Stock gives them away on special occasions throughout the year but none more generously than on Christmas . For a couple of years , she made them for the Clintons ' private tree . One ornament depicted Hillary and her two brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Another year , she made " The Nutcracker . " <p> The Stocks started their own holiday traditions after they were caught in an Indiana snowstorm one year . A decade of holiday marathons to and from the Midwest finally convinced them that it was time to issue open invitations to their families . <p> " We basically told them we 'd love to have them to our house , " Stock recalls , " but that it was time for us to start our own Thanksgiving and Christmas traditions that we had celebrated as kids . " <p> At the time , they were living in Alexandria 's Cameron Mews , later moved into Alexandria 's Rosemont area and eventually to Duke Street . Here , with its 18th-century houses , walled gardens , tucked-away parks and tree-canopied streets , was the backdrop of American holiday traditions . <p> George Washington may never have hung his Christmas stocking in the Stocks ' mid-Georgian brick house . But it 's not improbable that the first president dined there as the guest of his favorite nephew , Bushrod , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , you ca n't turn a corner without bumping into the names of 18th- and 19th-century power players : the Lees of Virginia , who once owned the land the Stocks ' house sits on ; the Marquis de Lafayette , whom James Monroe invited for a visit and billeted a few doors away ; John Adams , who appointed Bushrod Washington to the Supreme Court a year before Uncle George died and left him Mount Vernon . <p> Bushrod 's law offices are now the Stocks ' library and dining room . Instead of law books and quill pens , works by Scott Turow , Judith Krantz and Clive Cussler share bookshelves with snapshots of the Stocks ' private lives among contemporary power players . <p> Jimmy Carter smiles back at Chase Stock during an Easter Egg Roll .

When he died , so did any hopes she had of becoming a doctor . Working in a bookstore 40 hours a week , she paid her way through Purdue University . <p> After graduation with a degree in education , she only needed six weeks on the job to decide teaching was n't for her . Her one-way ticket out of the Midwest was as a Pan American Airways flight attendant . <p> She married Purdue classmate Stuart Stock while he was at Harvard Law School . They moved from Cambridge to New York and finally Washington , where he was Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall 's clerk . <p> By then , flight attendant Ann Stock was nursing a growing fear of flying . She tells of being stricken with terror on one flight as an electrical phenomenon known as Saint Elmo 's fire danced menacingly on the plane 's wing . She often threatened to take the train home after such trips ; that time in Buenos Aires she checked out ship departures to the States . <p> On Capitol Hill , the Stocks ' tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , with sessions lasting well into the night . Among their friends was lawyer and fellow Midwesterner Robert Barnett , in those days Justice Byron White 's law clerk . <p> " All of us were obsessed by politics , or maybe it was government , " recalls Braver , who is married to Barnett . " Here we were , these young kids , arriving in Washington and seeing this amazing thing , Watergate , unfold before our eyes . Like everyone else in the city , we were totally absorbed . " <p> Stock was training flight attendants when Pan Am 's financial problems worsened . She bailed out rather than revert to the care and feeding of passengers . About then Vice President Mondale 's press operations needed an office manager , and Barnett , by then Mondale 's legislative assistant , recommended her . <p> In 1979 , Stock , the upwardly mobile baby boomer , took time out to be a mom . A few years later , her son 's picture appeared in USA Today in a feature on working mothers who bring their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , Stock says . When Carter-Mondale lost in 1980 , she went to Bloomingdale 's . But in 1984 , the lure of politics proved irresistible . She took leave to join Mondale 's presidential campaign as deputy to press secretary Maxine Isaacs . <p> " I always wanted her by my side . She could handle anything , " recalls Isaacs , married to James A. Johnson , head of Fannie Mae and chairman of the Kennedy Center board , where Ann Stock has been vice president for institutional affairs since September . <p> The Stocks ' Old Town Alexandria home is older than the White House , but for all its colonial formality and landmark geneaology , it is comfortably unpretentious . What initially caught their eye was the detail  --  the crown moldings , the chair rails , the gleaming old wood floors . <p> For them , the overall integrity of its period translated into character . With their period furniture , patterned fabrics and walls and woodwork painted in Williamsburg greens and blues , the total effect is uncontrived decorating , personalized with legitimate interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a " Blue Nose " sailing ship with red-laquered hull that dates back to Stuart Stock 's childhood and a doting grandfather . On a music stand , an encyclopedia of trains speaks to another of his fascinations . <p> Between two settees , a butler 's tray holds three graduated amber-colored glass spheres entitled " The Float . " Created by pre-eminent American glassblower Dale Chihuly , it was a gift from the Clintons the year before Ann Stock turned 50 ( her actual birthday fell awkwardly during the presidential campaign ) . <p> Like many houses of its period , this one was built from English pattern books carried in the kits of itinerant builders between the Carolinas and Boston . More often than not , kitchens were fire hazards built of dispensable cheaper materials and detached from the main dwellings . <p> The Stocks ' three-story brick house had a detached kitchen , but in some incarnation grew into a long , narrow L-shape with a galley kitchen . Two years ago , it underwent a major renovation . For two months , they cooked on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinets and appliances and repositioned the sink under a window with a view of the outdoors . <p> The move from Rosemont 's spacious farmhouse meant scaling down the size of  --  but not her enthusiasm for  --  entertaining . Ann Stock minimizes space limitations with the same meticulous organization that characterizes her daily life . <p> " I do n't want to spend all night making something happen in the kitchen , " she says . " I 'd rather be talking to people in the kitchen . " <p> On holidays , tradition calls for an adult table of 12 in the dining room and a children 's table of six in the library . But last year , there was a revolt . " We had a fight with Rita and Bob Barnett , whose daughter had just come back from college , " says Stock . " Rita wanted to hear what went on . " <p> This year , with her own child home for Thanksgiving , Stock likely will settle the matter using her " sleight of hand " seating talents by mixing the tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of aged Virginia barn siding . It opens onto a brick-walled courtyard whose focal point is Stuart Stock 's espaliered dwarf apple trees . Ann Stock says most Sundays her husband is clipping and training them to preserve their intricate cross-hatching . <p> The Stocks like the informality of courtyard entertaining . One spring night , under the gaze of a grinning gargoyle and a porky pig weathervane , Stock invited the gang over for a cookout . <p> When the nation 's 42nd president volunteered as sous-chef , she let him turn the pork chops . <p> Donnie Radcliffe , who covered the White House for The Post 's Style section for many years , is the author of books on Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barbara Bush , both published by Warner .
