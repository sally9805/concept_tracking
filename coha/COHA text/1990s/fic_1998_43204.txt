Mr. J. H. Al , den Is Introduced to His Grandchildren WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE Jess , Henry , Violet , and Benny Alden , four orphaned children , run away thinking that their grandfather is coming to claim them . Although they have never seen him , they believe him to be a cruel man . During a storm , they take shelter in an old railroad boxcar that they find stranded in the woods , and decide to live there . They furnish it with a few odds and ends that they find in a dump heap . Henry finds a job in a nearby town helping young Dr. McAllister and his mother , and returns each night to the boxcar home with food and other supplies . The doctor becomes very curious when Henry brings his little brother and two sisters along with him one day to help with the cherry picking . That night , Dr. McAllister is surprised to find an advertisement in the paper , offering a reward of $5,000 for information concerning four lost children . " Whew ! " he exclaims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is offering the reward <p> Later Henry attends Field Day in the nearby town of Intervale , and enters the free-for-all-race . When he wins , he receives a loving cup and the twenty-five-dollar prize from the hands of Mr. J. H. Alden , one of the wealthy men who sponsor the meet . When asked for his name , the boy gives his first and middle names only , not daring to give his last one . " Henry James , " he replies . Violet suddenly becomes very ill , and Henry runs down the hill for Dr. McAllister . The doctor takes all the children to his home . The next morning a visitor arrives , and Benny entertains him until the doctor comes downstairs . The visitor who is Mr. J H. Alden , is surprised to discover that Benny and the boy who won the free-for-all-race are two of his lost grandchildren . Part VII " They will never go with you , " declared Mrs. McAllister finally to the worried grandfather , " unless you give us time to break the news gradually . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ill . " " Could n't I see them ? " begged the man . " I could pretend I was a friend of yours who liked children . I would promise not to tell them until you consented . " " That might do , " said Dr. McAllister . " If they grow to like you before they know who you are , it will make things easier . " James Henry Alden 's chauffeur was sent for a gold-monogrammed suitcase and his young man to wait upon him . Irish Mary held up her hands in despair when she learned for whom she must cook . " Do n't you worry , Mary Bridget Flynn , " said Dr. McAllister with emphasis . " You could cook for the King of England ! Just broil a chicken for lunch and make one of your peach shortcakes , and I 'll answer for him . " When lunchtime came , J. H. Alden saw all his grandchildren except Violet . He smiled with delight when he saw Jess coming down the stairs . Henry shook hands with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranger all through the meal . Where have I seen that man before ? Henry wondered . Mrs. McAllister had given the children 's names clearly when she introduced them-Jess , Benny , and Henry . Henry James , she had added . " And , children , this is Mr. Henry , " she finished , laughing . " Henry and Mr. Henry , " repeated Benny with satisfaction . " That 's right , " smiled the stranger . He caught their attention , he told them wonderful stories about a steel rail which held up an entire bridge until the people had time to get off , about his collie dog , about a cucumber in his garden , growing inside of a glass bottle . Henry was interested . Benny was fascinated . " I 'd like to see the cucumber , " said Benny , pausing in the middle of his shortcake . " Would you , indeed ? " asked Mr. Alden , delighted . " Some day , if Mrs. McAllister is willing , you and I will ride over to my garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Violet ? " asked Benny , waiting breathlessly for an answer . " We 'll bring it to Violet , " agreed Mr. Alden . After lunch he went to sleep in the easy-chair in the doctor 's office . That is , he threw his head back and shut his eyes , and breathed very heavily Jess went through the room once with ice water . She was humming , for Violet was better , but the moment she saw the stranger asleep , she stopped her singing abruptly and tiptoed the rest of the way . Then she turned around and came back . Very carefully she shoved a cushion under the man 's feet . It was so gently done that even if he had really been asleep , he would never have awakened . As it was , he could not resist opening one eye the slightest crack to see the bright chestnut hair as it passed out of sight . No , he thought to himself , if she really hated me , she would never have done that . The children were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When at last , one day , he was allowed to see Violet and came softly into her room with a bouquet of fragrant English double violets , they loved him . He won all their hearts when he patted her dark head and told her very simply that he was sorry she had been sick . It would be hard to say that J. H. Alden had a favorite grandchild , but certainly his manner with Violet was very gentle . It was clear to everyone , even to the anxious nurse , that the stranger was not tiring the sick child . He told her in a pleasant everyday voice about his garden and his greenhouses where the violets came from-about the old Swedish gardener who always said he must " vater the wi-lets . " " I 'd love to see him , " said Violet earnestly . " How long are you going to stay here ? " Benny piped up . It was not altogether a polite question , but it was clear to them all that Benny wanted him to stay , so they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my boy , " answered the stranger quietly . Then he left the sickroom , for he knew he should not stay long . Something in the man 's last sentence rang in Henry 's ears . He repeated it over and over in his mind , trying to remember where he had heard that same voice say " my boy . " He made an excuse to work in the flower beds along the veranda , in order to glance occasionally at the man 's face , as he sat reading under a tree . Often Henry thought he had caught hold of his wandering memory . Then the man turned his head and Henry lost it again altogether . Suddenly it came to him , as the man smiled over his book . This was the man who had shaken hands with him on the day of the race ! And he had said , " I like your spirit , my boy . " That was it ! Henry sat down out of sight and weeded geraniums for a few moments . It is a wonder he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind was so far away . " I did n't remember him at first , because I was so excited when he shook hands with me , " decided Henry . Then he was apparently thunderstruck afresh . He sat with his weeder on his knee and his mouth open . " He 's the man who passed me the trophy cup with the wings ! " He stole another look around the corner , and this satisfied him . " Same man exactly , " he said . When he had finished the flower bed , he thought he heard the young doctor moving in the office . He stuck his head in the open door . The doctor sat at his desk , taking notes from a book . <p> " Do you know who presented the prizes on Field Day ? " asked Henry curiously . " Know what his name was ? " " James Alden , of the steel mills , " replied the doctor carelessly . " J. H. Alden-over in Greenfield . " Dr. McAllister , to all appearances , returned to his notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Henry the skies were reeling . He withdrew his head and sat still on the step . That delightful man his grandfather ? It was impossible . He was too young , to begin with . Henry expected a whitehaired gentleman with a cane and a terrible voice . All the time though , he knew that it was not only possible , but really true . He recalled the man 's reply to Benny 's direct question-he had said he was going to stay as long as they would let him . Could it be that the man knew them without introducing himself ? A perfect torrent of thoughts assailed Henry as he sat crouched on the office steps . It was clear to him now that Mrs. McAllister had called him Mr. Henry on purpose . Then he noticed that the man was getting out of his chair under the trees . It 's now or never , thought Henry . I 've got to know ! He walked eagerly after the man who was going toward the garden with his back turned . Henry easily caught up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . " Are you James Henry Alden of Greenfield ? " panted Henry " I am , my boy , " returned the man with a long look . " Does that question of yours mean that you know that I know that you are Henry James Alden ? " " Yes , n said Henry , simply . The man 's eyes filled with tears , and J. H. Alden of the Steel Mills shook hands for the third time with his grandson , H. J. Alden of the Home for Tramps . In less than an hour , the town was buzzing with the news . The chauffeur told the maids , and the maids told the grocery man , and the grocery man went from house to house telling everyone that old James Alden had found his four grandchildren at last . In fact , the biggest part of the town knew it before the younger children themselves . Jess and Benny came across the lawn to select some white moonflowers for Violet 's tray . They were just in time to hear Henry say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whirling around to gaze at them . " Yes , Jess , " said Henry eagerly . " He 's the man we 've been running away from all this time . " " I thought you was old , " observed Benny . " And awf'ly cross . Jess said so . " " I did n't know , Benny , " said Jess , turning pink . To think of running away from this kind friend ! But her grandfather did not seem to mind . He stroked her silky hair and suggested that they all go up to Violet 's room with the moonflowers . There was no stopping Benny . He rushed into Violet 's room , dragging his grandfather by one hand , and shouting , " It 's Grandfather , Violet , and he 's nice , after all , I should n't wonder ! " When Violet at last understood just what Benny was trying to say , she was perfectly happy to rest against her ruffled pillows with one hand curled about her grandfather 's arm and listen to the rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alden at last . They all looked at one another , even Dr. McAllister and his mother . Then they all laughed as if they never would stop . " You just ought to see ! " observed Dr. McAllister , wiping his eyes . " What ? " said the children all at once . " You never saw it in the daytime ! " " You do n't mean it ! " returned the doctor , teasing them . " I have seen it quite a number of times in the daytime . " " Seen what , in heaven 's name ? " asked Mr. Alden at last . Then they told him , while interrupting one another , about the beds of pine needles , the wonderful dishes , the boxcar roof over all , the fireplace , and the swimming pool . " That 's where Violet got her bronchitis , " observed the doctor , " sitting by that pool . She should n't have done it . I thought so from the first . " " You thought so ? " repeated Henry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? I 'm sure I did n't know that myself . " " I was your most frequent visitor , " declared the doctor , enjoying himself hugely . " I hope you were our only one , " said Jess , her jaw dropping open . " Well , I think I was , " said the doctor . " The first night after Henry mowed my lawn , I followed him as far as the hill to see where he lived . " " Why did you do that ? " interrupted Mr. Alden . " I liked his looks , " returned the doctor . " I noticed that he did n't tell much about himself and I was curious . " " But you surely did n't see the boxcar then , " said Jess . *No , but I came back that night and hunted around , " replied Dr. McAllister . " At about eleven o'clock ! " Henry cried . The doctor nodded . " He was our rabbit ! ' " said Henry and Jess together . " I made as little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw the door move , and so I thought someone was inside . When I heard the dog bark , I was sure of it and went home . " " But you came back ? " questioned Jess . " Yes , every time I knew all of you were safe in my garden , I paid the boxcar a little visit , just to be sure you were having enough to eat and enough dishes . " The doctor laughed . " When I found you had a strainer and a vase of flowers and a saltshaker and a cut-glass punch bowl , I stopped worrying . " <p> " Did n't you suspect they were my children ? " demanded Mr. Alden . " Did n't you see my advertisement ? Why did n't you notify me at once ? " " They were having such a good time , " confessed the doctor . " And I was , too . I just wanted to see how long they could manage their own affairs . They did very well-until Violet got sick . Then I notified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that boy and girl of yours are born business managers , Mr. Alden ! " Mr. Alden took note of this . " But I do n't see , yet , how you knew Violet sat by the pool , " said Jess curiously . " You could n't know that , of course , " replied the doctor . " I went up twice when I knew Henry had taken the dog down to my barn to catch rats . I hid behind the big white rock with the flat top . " " That 's Lookout Rock , " explained Jess , " where we used to let Benny watch for Henry . But we did n't hear you . " " No , " said Dr. McAllister . " I did n't even snap a twig those times . But I had the very best time when I went with Mother . " " Have you seen it , too ? " cried the children . " I have , indeed ! " returned Mrs. McAllister . " I have even had a drink from your well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Alden patiently " We 'll show it to you ! " screamed Benny . " And I 'll show you my wheels made on a cart , and my bed out of hay , and my pink cup ! " " Good for you , Benny , " said Mr. Alden , pleased . " When Violet gets well , we 'll all go up there , and if you 'll show me your house , I 'll show you mine . " " Have you got a house ? " asked Benny in surprise . " Yes . You can live there with me , if you like it , " replied Mr. Alden . " I have been looking for you for nearly two months . " Under Mrs. McAllister 's wonderful care , Violet soon became strong again , but she had been skipping around the garden for several days before the doctor would allow the visit to the boxcar house . When at last the whole party started out in the great limousine , many people looked out of their windows to watch Mr. Alden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy who won the race and were glad that he had found such a friend . When the children reached their beloved home , they were like wild things . Watch capered about furiously , taking little swims in the pool and sniffing at all the dear old familiar things . Mr. Alden seated himself on a rock and watched them all , exchanging a glance now and then with Mrs. McAllister and her son . " See our building , " shouted Benny , for that was what he always called the fireplace . " It really burns , too . And this is the well , and this is the dishpan , and this is the " frigerator ! " At last everyone climbed into the boxcar itself , and Mr. Alden saw the beds , the cash account on the wall , the wonderful shelf , and each separate dish . Each dish had a story of its own . " That 's more than my dishes have , " observed Mr. Alden . Mrs. McAllister , who knew what his dishes were , was silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Benny drank from his pink cup . Watch could n't understand why they went away at all , but it was a trifle cool on the hill now when the sun began to sink . After rolling the door shut , they left regretfully . " Tomorrow , " suggested Mr. Alden , as they drove home , " will you all come and see my house ? " " Oh , yes , " agreed the children happily , little dreaming what was in store for them on the next day and all the days to come . ( to be concluded in the next issue )
