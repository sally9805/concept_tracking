Amon Goeth , commandant of the Plaszow death camp , strides into the basement of his barracks mansion and sees his maid , the lovely Jewish internee Helen Hirsch ( Embeth Davidtz ) . He had chosen her as window dressing for the mausoleum he runs , but her strength and grace have touched him . For a crucial moment , on the face of actor Ralph Fiennes , evil pauses to consider itself . Could I have a decent feeling ? Could I love this base creature , this beautiful thing , this Jewess ? Just as quickly , and subtly , Fiennes ' face tells us no . Goeth 's fists flail out , not so much at Hirsch as at the recognition that he is doomed to solitude by his wickedness . <P> More than anything else in Steven Spielberg 's Schindler 's List , this potent , poignant scene illuminates the moral stupor of the totalitarian heart . And the performance has made an instant star of an actor previously known only in Britain . Already Ralph Fiennes ( the name is Welsh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a New York Film Critics Circle citation and , as of last week , an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his work in Schindler 's List . In September moviegoers will see him as Charles van Doren , that fallen savant of ' 50s TV , in Robert Redford 's much touted Quiz Show . After that , who can say ? Spielberg can : " If he picks the right roles and does n't forget the theater , I think he can eventually be Alec Guinness or Laurence Olivier . " <P> He is already  --  and this is creepy , considering the quicksilver brutality of his Goeth  --  a burgeoning sex symbol . Doughy and dark in the movie or slim , handsome and smiling in person , Fiennes , 31 , is the improbable hunk . <P> The real Amon Goeth was no hunk . But he was an artist of evil  --  grandly deranged , creatively sadistic . He would set his dogs on children and watch them be devoured . " The people he whipped , " Fiennes says , " had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whipping started from the beginning . " <P> How could anyone live inside this monster 's skin for the three harrowing months of filming ? Perhaps for so mesmerizing a role , the question must be , How could any actor not want to ? " In playing Amon , " says Fiennes , who put on 28 lbs . for the part , " I got close to his pain . Inside him is a fractured , miserable human being . I feel split about him , sorry for him . He 's like some dirty , battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to . " <P> Fiennes is as reluctant to discuss his personal life as he is ready to analyze Goeth 's . But it is no state secret that he was born in Suffolk , eldest of the six children of Mark Fiennes , a farmer turned photographer , and his wife , Jini a novelist and travel writer who died last year . His family moved often , and the boy was educated by Episcopalians , Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art , he rocketed through the British repertory system . Then he attracted the best kind of attention : Spielberg's.
