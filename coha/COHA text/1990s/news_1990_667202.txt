<p> Dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov and choreographer Mark Morris have become the dance world 's oddest couple . <p> Trim , reserved , clearheaded and as precise as his legendary ballet performances , Baryshnikov is financing , producing and starring in the newly formed White Oak Dance Project 's 17-city tour , starting today in Boston . He will appear in dances choreographed by Morris , the extroverted , bushy-haired , ultra-hip feral child of modern dance . <p> Reactions to their past collaborations - when Baryshnikov invited Morris to choreograph for American Ballet Theatre and when Morris invited Baryshnikov to dance with his company in Brussels - have been wildly unpredictable . Some critics complained that Morris wasted Baryshnikov 's virtuosity . But when the two performed with Morris ' company at the Brooklyn Academy of Music 's Next Wave Festival earlier this month , they were greeted with the kind of ovations usually reserved for rock stars . <p> " Somehow , " Baryshnikov says , " it works . " But who knows why . <p> Between the White Oak troupe 's rehearsals at paper magnate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main source of campy fun was gathering in Morris ' room at night to watch Jeopardy ! on TV and eat cheese balls . But Baryshnikov ( a Jeopardy ! neophyte ) did n't get the humor at all : " I was pleasantly surprised to see so many bright , young people . Some of the questions are very complex . " <p> But during rehearsals Baryshnikov and Morris complement each other like yin and yang . Calling out instructions to his dancers with a cigarette in one hand and a can of beer in the other , the flamboyant , 32-year-old Morris gives a certain levity to the 42-year-old Baryshnikov , whoplayed a ballet dancer in the 1977 film The Turning Point , danced classical roles on TV and earlier this year wrapped up a decade as artistic director of American Ballet Theatre . <p> But Baryshnikov often refreshes himself at the cutting edge : He worked with choreographer Twyla Tharp in the 1970s when she had little more than a cult following . And only a day after the White Oak tour , he 'll start shooting The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1919 silent classic about magic and hypnosis in which the doctor is named " Caligari . " The ever- provocative Peter Sellars directs . <p> " I could stay with the classical ballets and keep myself in perfectly tuned shape and dance until I 'm 50 , " he says . " But what a boring career ! I never wanted it . <p> " A lot of people thought I was crazy , destroying my body to do a lot of modern repertoire . And the ( more angular ) movements of modern dance have definitely shortened my career . I 've had five operations on my leg in the last few years . But who cares ? I 've always liked Mark 's work . You want to work with people you admire and create a situation that 's exciting and fun like this . " Because of his friendship with plantation owner Gilman , Baryshnikov has spent time here off and on since his dramatic defection from the Soviet Union in 1974 . But it 's usually been social visits , sometimes with his ex-flame Jessica Lange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a new company . The quiet , secluded spread has 300 of its 7,000 acres given over to pens full of endangered species - white rhinos , antelopes , zebras and black swans . <p> Unfortunately , there 's little time for petting - or even for Baryshnikov to walk his amiable mongrel dog , Tim , who lounges around the rehearsal hall . They work all day , and on this one , Morris is breaking through a five-day creative block : " I 'm waiting for inspirazione ! " <p> Baryshnikov and others stand by patiently . Morris tries out a few steps from his vast points of reference , ranging from ancient Greek art to a kiddie show he watched while growing up in Seattle . He grows excited when he finds a flourish of movement that ties up the whole work : " That 's it ! Ahhh ! That 's it ! " <p> And as they 're breaking for lunch , Morris has a bonus : " The name of my dance is Motorcade ! " <p> Motorcade ? It 's so offbeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's official , " Morris says . " There are lots of processionals and the music ( by composer Camille Saint-Saens ) is abstract and important-sounding . " <p> At the other extreme , Morris uses the music of Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys for Going Away Party , which will be on the tour . <p> At lunch , held in a comfy cabin on the grounds , Baryshnikov sits in a fatherly fashion at the head of the table . Morris lounges around the foot , drinking beer and wearing a T-shirt popular with liberated gays showing two male sailors kissing with the caption " Read My Lips . " <p> The discussion is brainy : The war in Iraq and casting policies of Actors Equity are thrashed around . Dancers are stereotyped as stupid , but that 's not the case with Morris ' . <p> " I could have automatons if I wanted , but I want people , " he says . " A company of teen-age bulimics has n't had many thoughts . You can tell . There 's no resonance . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people on his level , he has patience to deal with the trial and error and waiting around that comes with being part of a new piece - or being part of an ensemble . <p> " When the material is done for you , it fits so much tighter , " Baryshnikov says . " It 's like wearing a new pair of shoes - though it 's painful for a few hours , it 's much better than someone else 's shoes . And then later , you have much more freedom to perform it onstage because you know the piece inside and out . " <p> It 's a creative indulgence to be sure , particularly considering that even if the tour is a big success , it wo n't match the megabucks he makes for endorsements ( the latest being a line of sport clothes ) and films such as Russian Roulette , an espionage thriller with Gene Hackman that comes out in 1991 . <p> " Sometimes you work because you have to work , " he says . " You have responsibilities to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lange ) and a style of living . But now , I 'm excited to do this . " <p> And he has no fears of the controversy that may greet him in cities that have never seen Morris ' work , which is liberated from the usual male/female dance conventions . In a time when anything faintly homoerotic can cause an adverse reaction , Morris has men dance with men and women with women . <p> " Mark gives totally equal opportunity for a man and a woman to express themselves , " Baryshnikov says . " There has been such a renaissance in dance in the last 20 years , audiences are ready for most any kind of complexity . A beautiful dance is a beautiful dance .
