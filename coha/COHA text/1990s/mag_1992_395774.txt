MANY FLY FISHERMEN think of nymph fishing as a difficult pursuit requiring intricate technical skills as well as a sixth sense available only to a lucky few . Nothing could be further from the truth . Actually , the basic rules of nymphing are simple . First , there are only two ways to fish a nymph : dead drift or with action ; second , there are only two places to fish a nymph : on the bottom or on the top . With few exceptions , these rules are all the nymph fisherman needs to know . Fishing a fly with action means the angler moves the fly . Casting across and allowing the fly to swing , actively stripping the line , and jigging the rod tip are all examples of this . A dead-drifted fly , on the other hand , goes where the currents take it . Dead-drift nymphing and dry fly fishing have a common problem : drag . For the dry fly fisherman , drag is often visible : the fly can be seen coursing over the surface , creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nymph fisherman ca n't see drag because the fly sinks . For this reason , nymph fishermen should always assume that drag is occurring and use tactics designed to eliminate the problem . When presenting the imitation dead drift just under or in the surface film ( to suggest a hatching midge , caddisfly , or mayfly , for example ) the nymph fisherman uses drag-eliminating tactics common to the dry fly angler . These include the puddle cast , pile cast , or S-cast for fishing upstream ; the curve cast , curve mend , or reach mend for fishing across-stream ; and the parachute mend when fishing downstream . Regardless of which cast you are using , the best way to fish a nymph in or just under the film is with a greased leader . The leader is treated with a thin coat of a paste-type fly flotant , right out to within a few inches of the fly . ( Put the flotant on your fingers and rub it onto the leader . ) Thus treated , the leader floats on the surface , holding the fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also creates a track on the surface that you can use to see the fish 's take . When the trout intercepts the fly , the leader is pulled under sharply  --  your clue to set the hook . All fly fishermen hope to encounter trout feeding at the surface , but most of the time the fish are feeding on , or within a few inches of , the bottom . That 's because most food organisms are found on the bottom most of the time  --  even during a hatch . Thus , dead-drifting a nymph along the bottom can be extremely effective at almost any time . I prefer to use a floating line rather than a sinking line when dead-drifting a fly along the bottom , mainly because most nymphs live in relatively shallow water ( less than 4 feet deep ) and a floating line can be mended to help minimize drag . In the fast water of a riffle or swift run , however , you 'll need to do more than simply mend line . Because the floating line is on top ( where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom ( where the slowest currents occur ) , the fast-moving line continually pulls on the fly , dragging it back toward the surface . Mending the line on the surface can remove across-stream as well as upstream and downstream drag , but the only way to eliminate upward drag is to slow down the fly line so that it moves the same speed as the fly . The most effective way to do this is to attach split shot to the leader . I prefer split shot because it can be easily added or removed and comes in a host of sizes . Use only enough to hold the fly down against the drag of the line . The shot should not hit the bottom and stop dead ; it should slide along , ticking and touching , slowing the line and giving the fly a natural appearance . If the shot hangs up too often , remove some or use smaller sizes . If the shot does n't get down all the way , add a piece or two or go to a larger size . Twist-on lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , but are not as rapidly adjustable as split shot . To help see the fish 's take , as well as track the speed of the line , attach a strike indicator at the top of the tippet . The indicator , which is at or near the surface , should go slower than the surrounding water ( remember , the fly is in the slow bottom currents ) . If it 's racing along at the same speed as the surface , add more weight to the leader . When a fish intercepts the fly , the indicator pauses or moves up or across stream . The indicator will also pause if the shot or fly catches on the bottom . Since you ca n't tell the difference between a fish 's strike and a snag , quickly lift the rod just enough to tighten the line . If it is a fish , the hook will be set . If it 's not , the shot or fly will usually come loose and continue to drift along in the bottom zone , allowing you to keep fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a technique that will allow the fly to sink rapidly . With a straight-line cast , drag sets in immediately regardless of leader design , and the shot is towed along under the surface by the rapidly moving line For the shot to sink at the desired rate , a slackline cast is essential . When fishing upstream , the most efficient way to introduce the necessary slack is with a tuck cast , which delivers the line high and parallel to the surface of the water ( as in making a false cast ) . Do n't try to use a super-tight line loop like you would when casting a dry fly ; the weight of the shot causes the leader to sag , and with a tight loop it will catch the rod or line ( or a protruding ear ) . Use a wide-to moderate-sized line loop . At the end of the forward cast , the weight of the shot will cause the leader to jump over and tuck down ahead of the line . The shot and fly hit first , and the leader follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot sinks instantly . It 's an extremely effective tactic that greatly reduces the size of the shot needed to sink the fly . The tuck cast is also used to deliver the fly in an across-stream direction . But because the line is now lying across the currents , it 's necessary to mend the line to eliminate drag introduced as the currents tug against the belly of the line . A curve cast or a reach or curve mend will solve the problem nicely . So will holding the rod up to keep the line off the currents . This lifting tactic is especially useful when you 're fishing a relatively short line ( under 20 feet ) , and in fast water stretches that 's all that 's often necessary . When you lift the rod tip , put only enough tension on the line to get it off the fast currents . If you pull too hard , you 'll lift the fly back to the surface . SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO GET THE fly to the fish , you need to cast downstream . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mend . Stop the rod high in the normal fashion for making the tuck cast , but keep the rod tip pointing vertically as the line falls to the surface ( do n't lower it in the normal fashion ) . After the line is on the water , lower the rod tip so that the portion of the line extending down to the water can be fed into the drift at the same speed as the currents are taking the line downstream . These same bottom-bouncing nymphing tactics can be used in areas of slow flow , too . Use the same equipment , but reduce the size and quantity of split shot or eliminate it altogether . Dead-drift nymphing is not a mysterious activity that only a handful of select fly fishermen can master . Its requirements are simple and its rules few . The rewards , on the other hand , are great . Do n't pass up another season without trying this most effective of nymphing tactics . SPECIAL NYMPH LEADERS * For nymphing in the film , I use a dry fly technique  --  a George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " curves that help to dampen or eliminate drag . This leader is built with a relatively thin-diameter butt and long tippet . A typical 9-foot leader for fishing the film with nymphs in the size 10 to 16 range would be 4 feet of 0.014-inch Maxima , 1 foot of 0.010 ( 1X ) tippet material , and , depending on fly size , 4 feet of 0.008 ( 3X ) , or 4 feet of 0.007 ( 4X ) , or 4 feet of 0.006 ( 5X ) for the tippet . For dead-drifting a nymph along the bottom in fast water with split shot , I use a specially designed leader with a 4-to 6-foot compound tippet . The length of the tippet should be approximately one and a half to two times the depth of the water being fished . The rear portion of the compound tippet is two-to three-thousandths inch larger in diameter than the 6-to 8-inch-long terminal piece to which the fly is secured . For example , if I 'm using a size 12 nymph and want to use a 4-foot tippet that ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by six inches of 4X . The shot goes just above the knot holding the two pieces together . This way , the 2X portion of the tippet , rather than the 4X portion , takes the punishment of abrasion as the shot slides along over the bottom . The short piece of 4X keeps the fly close to the bottom yet allows it to dance around freely in the currents , nicely mimicking a drifting insect . Because the leader has to turn over a relatively heavy weight and hold a rather open loop during the cast , the butt diameter should be 0.020 or 0.018 inch . A typical nymphing leader with a long , compound 4X tippet would consist of 4 feet of 0.020-inch Maxima , 1 foot of 0.014-inch Maxima , 3-1/2 feet of 0.010 ( 2X ) tippet material , and 6 inches of 4X tippet material .
