<p> This was it : She had the brass ring . <p> Suddenly , all the long nights in half-empty cabarets vanished in a burst of " overnight success . " The searching , but never finding , melted away with the at-long-last look in her new husband 's eyes . For a moment , even wretched illness could not touch her . <p> In the last hour of her life , Nancy LaMott had everything she ever craved : fame , fortune , love , family , talent , passion , beauty , peace . The 43-year-old singer was unique , uniquely gifted , even in death . <p> " What is so compelling is that , down to the day ... she proved that you can be full of warts , have a scarred-up body , have disadvantages out the wazoo and make mistake after mistake , AND still you can be beautiful and brave , " says Peter Zapp , whom LaMott married a little more than an hour before she succumbed to uterine cancer last December . <p> Gathered around her at the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they were losing . " Yes , yes , yes , " she said to the priest who wed the couple even as Nancy was dying . In a strange way , the witnesses had never been so alive . <p> " She is a testament that you do n't have to give up or be bitter . There is hope for happiness . You can have a dream , " says Zapp , an actor who did not know that his dream , Nancy , would be gone seven months after they met . <p> Nancy LaMott would be the first to cringe at a saintly epitaph . She would not want to be a martyr giving in stoically to a maudlin death . <p> She was never so simple . Like all of us , she wore a million changing colors . She loved and was loved for as many reasons . That was what made her voice so transcendent . <p> Oh , there was the gift , those gloriously clear notes , the intimacy she brought to classic tunes by Mercer , Berlin , Gershwin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted them , the raw realness , the huge instinct and guts that suffused the tiny blue-eyed girl 's lifetime of song . <p> Her dad struggles a minute . <p> " She was just a damned good person , " says Jack LaMott , a retired Dow Chemical supervisor whose weekend band gave Nancy her start . He remembers her as a father would - for her slobby habits , the fattening foods she loved to eat , the easy way in which she unconditionally loved . <p> " I was always tough on her . Really tough . She 'd say , ' I 'm doing such and such a club this week . ' And I 'd say , ' Is that a good club ? I 've never heard of it . ' She 'd say , ' Yeah , Dad , ' it 's a good club . ' <p> " Finally , I said one day , ' Things must be going pretty good , because you have n't asked for any money lately . ' " <p> " You know , Dad , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do . " <p> And she was . <p> When she died in late 1995 , Nancy LaMott had a quarter-million dollars ' worth of contracts for 1996 . Kathie Lee Gifford had become a huge booster , promoting her at every opportunity . She 'd played the White House twice in recent months , so touching Bill Clinton that his call was among the last she received in the hospital . <p> She was on the brink . <p> But just as her career was on a wild upward spiral , cancer was taking her down . Illness was no stranger to LaMott , who at 17 was diagnosed with the chronic , chronically miserable bowel disorder known as Crohn 's disease . <p> When she took center stage , it was despite unrelenting pain , fatigue , arthritis and diarrhea . She sang through the steroid treatments and extended hospital stays . Sometimes , it was a struggle just to remain standing . <p> Only recently recovered from an intestinal operation that had given her a new lease on life , LaMott delayed cancer treatment , close confidantes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed would be her last . <p> " Listen to My Heart " is that final legacy . With full orchestra , she recorded it in two remarkable days . Like that , the pain went away . She was in the music , of it . She had some things she simply had to say . <p> Since her death , Midder Music , a home-grown label based at the Upper West Side apartment where Nancy LaMott lived , has been swamped daily with hundreds of calls and fond letters . More than 100,000 copies of the album - an astounding figure for a cabaret artist - have sold since its release in October , and posthumous CDs already are in the works . <p> " People are calling me at night , saying , ' I know this is weird . I 've never done anything like this , but I just had to talk to somebody who knew her , ' " says Scott Barnes , LaMott 's manager and dear friend . <p> " There was something very different about the way Nancy dealt with her career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Her last performance , a haunting rendition of " Moon River , " was on Charles Grodin 's CNBC cable talk show . When Barnes and his partner David Friedman , who produced all five of Nancy 's albums , look into her eyes on the video play-back , they see now that she knew what they did n't . <p> She was dying . She had begun the final , unknowable journey . <p> " She was nine days away from death . I do n't know how we could n't have seen it , " says Friedman , who promised Nancy that he would not rest until the whole world heard her sing . " I did n't see what she knew : ' Moon River ' is about that last trip she would make . " <p> On the frigid February night of her public memorial , it would n't have been surprising if only a handful of people turned out . She was not a big star . And yet there they were , hundreds of friends and fans wrapped around a midtown Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , irreverent jokes and solemn silence as she sang , her unlined face filling a big screen , her sweet voice filling the void . <p> " ' Make no mistake about it : The girl could be infuriating , undisciplined , pigheaded , incredibly manipulative and stubborn , " said Barnes , one of many friends who shared remembrances that night . <p> " But her innate goodness , genuine sweetness , courage , wicked sense of humor , deep capacity for trust and emotion - and that remarkable talent - managed to outweigh any difficulties . " <p> Nancy LaMott knew early on that she was made to sing . She grew up in Midland , Mich. , her brother 's best friend . Together , they made their way through childhood and divorce . Mutual love was their constant . <p> It was the tail-end of the swing era . Their dad 's band set the stage , playing live on the radio and at nightclubs back when jugglers , strippers , magicians and comedians still made Midwestern stands . <p> " We 'd stay up with baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , " says LaMott 's brother , Brett , now a chef in San Francisco . " Dad would bring the band back to the house and Nan and I would get up at 3 in the morning and have breakfast with them . " <p> When it was time to move on , Nancy and Brett made their way west to San Francisco , she singing and he accompanying her on drums . <p> " We were all confident that she 'd break through , " he says . " There was never any doubt . " <p> They bunked together , playing clubs through the late 1970s . She sold out everywhere , if on a small scale . She had n't broken through , but her partisans were fierce . <p> For all their loyalty , though , it was n't a living . <p> If Nancy LaMott picked up a check , it was historic . She never had money enough for a decent haircut , never had money enough to pay off her debts . The life was tough , often exhausting , except when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nancy 's piano accompanist and musical soulmate from 1985 until her death , saw the singer in all her shades - drunk and sober , on and off diets , in and out of love . He saw the cantankerousness and lovability , the rigor and total undiscipline , the constant struggle and tremendous gift that pulsed at her heart . <p> They played through all kinds of changes , nearly a decade in which Nancy went from rhinestone sweatshirts and sneakers at Manhattan holes-in-the wall to refined little black dresses at Tavern on the Green and Carnegie Hall . <p> " It 's a struggle for me right now , now that she 's gone , " he says . " Nancy and I started out with very little to go on , except talent and the desire to do this . I do n't know if I 'll ever be able to go there - where I was with her - again . " <p> On the cold December day that Nancy LaMott slipped away , she left behind all the uncompromising , fearless emotion that touched so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . <p> " Do n't write anything sappy about her , " Brett says . " My sister had a lot of class . She had dignity and grace . But her important thing was that she lived . She loved living . She had a great time . " <p> They all have stories to tell , all these wonderful people who loved her so . There were many Nancy Lamotts , and each of them held a special place in someone 's heart for some special reason . <p> She was LaMottski , the bawdy character who was constantly broke and having a bad hair day . She was Nance , the Michigan girl-next-door who wore glasses , eschewed make-up , baked snickerdoodles . She was LaMott the diva , demanding and mercurial , phenomenally gifted and frustratingly lazy . <p> " A perfect person could not have sung the way this woman did , " says Barnes , who is devoted to managing her still . " She would n't have resonated with people , our pain , if we thought she was perfect . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flawed , real people . " <p> And above all , that 's what Nancy LaMott was : a real person . <p> Often , she did n't know where she was going . That 's not unusual . What was unusual was the way in which she led with her heart . <p> " She was the magnet standing at the center of us all . She pulled us all in . She taught people how to love , " says Friedman , an accomplished composer and conductor best known for his Disney animated film scores . <p> " I was unable to write after Nancy died , " he says . Then , all at once the voice came to him while walking down Broadway a few weeks ago : <p> " It tells me , <p> " Trust the wind , breathe the air <p> " There 's a place you 're meant to be <p> " And you 're already there <p> " Open up your heart and let life in <p> " You know that you can always trust the wind " <p> Friedman did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move , though he knew she was a rare , legendary talent . He did it because he was compelled , like her countless fans , by an indefinable connection . <p> " You do n't have to know the way you 're going all the time , " explains Barnes . " Nancy knew this . It 's an illusion that there are other paths or other doors . There 's only the door you open and the path that you take . "
