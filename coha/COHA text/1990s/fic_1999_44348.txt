Meet Dorian Gray . He 's the best-looking man in town and he knows it . But Dorian 's vanity will get him into strange and terrible trouble . NARRATOR 2 : Our story begins in the studio of Basil Hallward , a famous portrait painter . Dorian is trying to stand perfectly still while Basil paints his portrait . Their friend , Harry Wotton , watches . HARRY : This is the best painting you 've ever done , Basil . If you send it to an exhibition , it 's sure to win first prize . BASIL : I 'm not going to exhibit this painting , Harry . HARRY : Why not ? Every painter in town will be jealous of your talent . DORIAN : And every man in town will be be jealous of my looks . BASIL : I put my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some stranger buy it . DORIAN : That 's true . I 'm much too good-looking to hang in some fat ugly banker 's living room . HARRY : Dorian , sometimes you 're so conceited . NARRAToR 1 : Basil makes a final brush stroke and steps back . BASIL : There ! It 's finished . HARRY : Amazing . It really is a masterpiece , Basil . This picture of Dorian is more real than Dorian himself . DORIAN : If it 's better-looking than me , I 'll cut it to shreds . BASIL : Come here and see it for yourself . DORIAN : It 's incredible . It almost looks like it 's breathing . HARRY : I want this painting , Basil . Name your price . BASIL : It 's not my painting . I made it for Dorian as a gift . But he 'll never sell it . DORIAN : I 'll sell it all right . But you 'll have to give me your gold watch for it . HARRY : You 've always wanted that watch , have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't trade it away . BASIL : I do n't understand . Why do n't you want the painting , Dorian ? Is there something wrong with it ? DORIAN : No . It 's perfect . That 's why I hate it . HARRY : That 's ridiculous . If it looks just like-you , how can you hate it ? DORIAN : Do n't you see ? When I start to get old and wrinkled and ugly , this picture of me will always be young and handsome . It 's not fair ! HARRY : Poor Dorian . It 's terrible to be so goodlooking , is n't it ? DORIAN : Go ahead , joke about it . But I wish I could trade places with it . I 'd give my very soul if I could stay young and handsome and the painting could get old and ugly ! NARRAToR 2 : The minute Dorian says those words , the men hear a rumble of thunder . HARRY : That 's odd . There 's not a cloud in the sky . NARRATOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a chair . HARRY : Dorian ! What 's wrong ? DORIAN : I feel suddenly cold and empty . I must go home . HARRY : Before you go , name your price for the painting , Dorian . Anything , just not my watch . DORIAN : I changed my mind . The painting 's not for sale . SCENE 2 NARRATOR 2 : Dorian takes the portrait to his mansion . The painting seems to make Dorian more vain than ever . He spends endless hours gazing at it . In fact , he spends more time with the painting than he does with his girlfriend , Sibyl . NARRATOR 1 : Sibyl is a beautiful young actress . One night she is backstage at the theater with her brother Jim , who is about to sail to Australia to seek his fortune . SIBYL : Good luck , Jim . I 'll miss you . Promise you wo n't forget about me . JIM : You 're the one who 's going to forget about me , thanks to that boyfriend of yours . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just jealous . JIM : I 'm sorry to say it , but I do n't trust that man , Sibyl . He 's shallow and vain . SIBYL : That 's a terrible thing to say . You should be more careful what you say about Dorian . I 'm going to marry him someday . JIM : You 're a fool if you believe that , Sibyl . A rich man like Gray is never going to marry a poor little nobody like you . SIBYL : He does n't care that I 'm poor . JIM : He does n't care about you at all . The only thing he cares about is your beauty . If you were n't so beautiful , he would n't hang around . SIBYL : That 's not true ! He promised to take care of me . JIM : He 'd better . Because , if he ever does you any harm , I 'll track him down like a dog and I 'll kill him . I swear it . NARRATOR 2 : That night , Dorian invites Basil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juliet . Basil and Harry admire her beauty . But Sibyl forgets her lines . She makes mistake after mistake . After the show , Dorian 's friends leave and he storms backstage . SIBYL : Dorian , what 's wrong ? DORIAN : You were terrible , Sibyl ! You embarrassed me in front of my friends . SIBYL : It does n't matter Dorian . I do n't want to act anymore . I only want to be with you . When we 're married , I 'm going to forget about the stage . DORIAN : You can forget about me , too . You killed my love tonight , Sibyl . Your ugliness up there on stage killed any feelings I had for you . NARRATOR 1 : Sibyl is shocked . Dorian has never been cruel to her like this before . SIBYL : Dorian ! You do n't mean that . DORIAN : I thought you were beautiful and talented , but you 're nothing - just a stupid girl . I was going to marry you and make you famous . But tonight you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry about tonight . I 'll work harder . I wo n't make mistakes anymore , I promise . I love you more than anything . DORIAN : I never want to see you again . SIBYL : Dorian , do n't leave me ! NARRATOR 2 : Dorian takes a last look at Sibyl . How ugly she seems with tears and makeup running down her face . He pushes her away . As he leaves , he feels the mysterious chill again . NARRATOR 1 : When Dorian gets home , he walks past his portrait and then suddenly stops and stares at the face in the painting . DORIAN : Something 's different . The smile on my face looks cruel now . But I do n't look like that , do I ? No , in the mirror I 'm the same . But the painting has changed ! Oh , no . . . What was it I said the day Basil finished this painting ? I wished I could stay young and handsome forever and the portrait would get old and wrinkled and ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SCENE 3 NARRATOR 2 : The next morning , the portrait looks even uglier than it did the night before . Dorian is frightened . He suddenly feels guilty about the way he treated Sibyl . Just then , Harry arrives . Dorian quickly pulls a screen in front of the painting so Harry ca n't see it . HARRY : I was sorry to hear about Sibyl , Dorian . DORIAN : I 'm the one who should be sorry . I was so mean to her . HARRY : You mean you talked to her last night after the play ? DORIAN : We had an argument . I said terrible things . But I 've learned my lesson . I 'm going to fix everything . HARRY : Fix everything ? How ? DORIAN : I 'm going to marry Sibyl , just like I promised her I would . HARRY : Dorian , what are you talking about ? Have n't you heard ? DORIAN : Heard what ? HARRY : Sibyl is dead . It 's in all the papers this morning . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed some kind of poison . DORIAN : No ! I ca n't believe it ! Harry , this is all my fault . I 'm in terrible trouble . HARRY : I do n't understand . What kind of trouble ? DORIAN : I ca n't tell you . Please , just go away and leave me alone . NARRATOR 1 : Harry leaves . Dorian uncovers the painting and stares at it . He talks to the image as if it is a real person . DORIAN : Now we know it 's true . I got my wish . I traded away my soul to stay young forever . I can feel it draining slowly out of my body . Well , so be it ! If I 've lost my soul , then I 'm immortal ! I can do whatever I want because I wo n't be punished - you will . But you 're getting uglier and uglier .

Just a penny , sir . DORIAN : How about a gold piece ? NARRATOR 2 : Dorian drops a rock in the blind man 's cup . DORIAN : Do n't spend it all in one place . BLIND MAN : Thank you , sir !

THIEF 1 : Good . Spill it . DORIAN : There 's a party tonight . All the richest people in town are going . And I know one rich man 's house that 's going to be dark and empty . THIEF 2 : Sounds like a juicy apple waiting to be picked . You sure nobody 's going to be there ? DORIAN : I 've never been wrong before , have I ? Here 's the address . The man 's name is Harry Wotton . THIEF 1 : What do you want in payment this time , Prince Charming ? DORIAN : Nothing much . Just a gold watch . I 'll tell you exactly where to find it .

Sibyl said people called you Prince Charming . Now , I 've got you . DORIAN : I never heard of her . You 're crazy . JIM : Say your prayers . You 've got one minute to live . DORIAN : Wait ! How long ago did your sister die ? JIM : Twenty years ago . DORIAN : Then I can prove it 's not me ! Take me over there , under that light so you can see my face . NARRATOR 2 : Jim sees Dorian 's face : It 's the face of a young man only 20 years old . JIM : I ca n't believe it . I almost killed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope you 've learned your lesson .
