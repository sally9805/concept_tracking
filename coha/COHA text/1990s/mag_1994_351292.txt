Frequent-flyer miles have long been the closest thing American travelers have to a free lunch . But the adage about there being no such thing seems to be coming true . In the biggest overhaul of frequent-flyer programs since American Airlines launched the first one in 1981 , most major U.S. carriers are boosting from 20,000 to 25,000 the miles required to earn a free domestic coach ticket . And the change , which the airlines plan to phase in by next February , is only the beginning : the cost of free flying will rise as well for many travelers to Europe and Asia . " The airlines have become victims of their own success , " says Randy Petersen , editor and publisher of the monthly trade journal Inside Flyer . " Frequent-flyer programs have simply become too popular . " <P> Such programs are both a blessing and a curse to a perpetually troubled industry that has lost more than $11 billion in the past four years alone . Just last week Delta Airlines said it would eliminate as many as 15,000 jobs , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help it compete with low-cost rivals like Southwest Airlines . And United said it lost nearly $100 million in the first quarter because of competition from the no-frills carriers . Amid such relentless bloodletting , some 10 million frequent flyers traveled free on U.S. airlines in 1993 , an amount equal to 7% of all passenger traffic . While those freebies may have helped instill customer loyalty , they also cut into the airlines ' bottom lines . <P> Partly as a result , airlines have diluted the value of frequent-flyer programs by fully 25% . But few passengers have complained much since United Airlines kicked off the retrenchments late last year . For one thing , business travelers typically fly more than enough miles to qualify for free trips under the new requirements . And vacationers can earn the needed extra points from companies that offer frequent-flyer miles on everything from hotel rooms to rental cars to long-distance telephone calls . Says David Stempler , director of the Washington-based International Airline Passengers Association : " Our members find that they are gaining miles in so many ways that the 5,000-mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But travelers could start to howl if airlines make further cutbacks in their frequent-flyer programs , which some industry watchers see as likely . Reason : Southwest and such aggressive discounters as Continental are forcing larger rivals to cut ticket prices on their short-haul routes , which have been one of the few profitable sources of airline revenue . Such reductions are coming on top of the seasonal fare war that Northwest kicked off in April when it lowered ticket prices to Hawaii by 40% . To help recoup the income , major carriers could be easily tempted to cut or discontinue frequent-flyer miles on hops of 400 or fewer miles .
