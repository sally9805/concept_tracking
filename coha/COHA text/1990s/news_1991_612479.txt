<p> In sterile laboratories across the United States , Europe and Japan , and in a growing number of human guinea pigs , genetic researchers are brewing a medical revolution . <p> The experiments - moving faster than many anticipated a year ago when they were first attempted - aim to treat currently incurable medical disorders by taking altered genes , the fundamental blueprint of all life , and inserting them into human bodies . <p> So far , the highly experimental therapy has been used in a handful of patients in two separate experiments - one to combat a fatal form of skin cancer and another to treat an extremely rare immune system disorder . None of the patients undergoing the therapy has had any major complications , and researchers described the initial success as encouraging . <p> But soon , researchers are expected to use genetic therapy on more widespread medical problems , including AIDS . <p> Scientists at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor recently won permission to begin experiments from two important government panels that monitor attempts to manipulate human genes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan , and his colleagues hope to insert new genes into the liver cells of patients afflicted with familial hypercholesterolemia , a disease perhaps best-known for killing Stormie Jones , a Texas girl who died last year at the age of 13 after a heart-liver transplant failed . <p> Scientists hope the experimental treatment may become a permanent therapy for the cholesterol disease , which now can be treated only with drugs and blood-cleansing techniques , or , in rare cases , with organ transplants . <p> Only a few hundred people in the United States suffer from a form of the cholesterol disorder severe enough to qualify them for the initial gene therapy trials . But researchers said the genetic approach could prove valuable for the treatment of less extreme cholesterol diseases , as well as other ailments that afflict the liver . <p> Pioneers in gene therapy research are excited about the success so far and where it is heading . <p> " It 's really sort of where our imagination leads us , " says Dr. R. Michael Blaese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where gene therapy has been attempted on two young girls suffering from a rare immune disorder . " There 's such incredible potential . " <p> Other attempts at using gene therapy against cancer , cardiovascular disease and blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia are further in the future . <p> But laboratory experiments in animals have also been encouraging . <p> Over the last few weeks scientists have reported : <p> Successfully treating kidney cancer in a mouse by inserting altered tumor cells to boost the mouse 's own immune system . The altered cells caused a kidney tumor on the mouse to disappear and they wiped out other cancerous cells circulating in its body . <p> Experiments in dogs and rabbits have shown that genetically altered cells inhibit the unchecked growth of smooth-muscle cells in the interior walls of coronary arteries . The therapy could go a long way toward ensuring that heart arteries reopened through angioplasty would remain open . <p> The possible targets of gene therapy will broaden when the $ 3 billion Human Genome Project provides a detailed map of disease-causing genes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly caused by genetic defects . With the exception of cystic fibrosis , which affects one in 2,500 white newborns , most are very rare . <p> The field has not been without controversy . Ethicists have debated the morality of genetic manipulation of human embryos , conjuring up images of genetically crafting a " master race . " Federal regulators wo n't approve any proposal to tamper with the genes of egg or sperm cells . But those concerns have outpaced scientific reality . Dr. Blaese notes that it 's extremely difficult to insert a gene into egg or sperm cells . <p> " Those are sort of science fiction discussions , " Dr. Blaese says . " No responsible scientist is recommending cloning people . We would n't know how to do it . " <p> Before experiments are approved , researchers face several layers of scientific and ethical review both inside and outside of government . <p> Dr. Blaese says the idea for gene therapy was born soon after Linus Pauling discovered the gene responsible for producing a sickle-shaped hemoglobin , the cause of sickle cell anemia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But blood and immune system disorders remain particularly attractive to researchers because of their connection to bone marrow . <p> The mother of all blood cells is stem cells , which make up less than 1 percent of the cells in bone marrow . White blood cells defend the body against disease and toxic substances . Researchers hope to be able to insert genes into stem cells to correct blood and immune system disorders , ranging from beta-thalassemia to AIDS . So far , scientists have found stem cells extraordinarily difficult to work with or grow outside the body . <p> The most likely scenario for AIDS therapies will involve inserting genes into special kinds of white blood cells , called T cells . The AIDS virus insinuates itself into the genetic makeup of T cells , destroying them or preventing them from orchestrating attacks on disease organisms . But the virus 's dismantling of the immune system may take years . <p> Dr. Blaese 's group hopes to capture some of these T cells from people who are infected with HIV but whose immune systems are still healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a genetic shield to those T cells , protecting them from infection by the AIDS virus or to prevent HIV from reproducing . <p> " In a few years , the scientific community might look back on the original " experiments and find them " to have been so naively simple that they might wonder how it could have caused so much fuss , " said Dr. W. French Anderson , one of the National Institutes of Health 's gene therapy pioneers . " 1991 was an eventful year ; 1992 promises to be even better . " ; Experiments target variety of ailments <p> Here 's a brief look at the disorders that scientists are now treating experimentally with genetic therapy , and some that may soon be tested : ; Treatments under way <p> Severe combined immune deficiency ( SCID ) . Over the past year , National Cancer Institute researchers have been transfusing genetically altered white blood cells into two girls with a form of this rare immune system disorder . The therapy is causing the girls , for the first time , to make the enzyme adenosine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system . They are both healthy and progressing well . <p> Melanoma . NCI researchers armed naturally cancer-fighting white blood cells with a gene to produce a potent anti-tumor toxin . Two patients with advanced melanoma , a deadly form of skin cancer , have received the genetically altered cells since the first of the year . They have developed no ill effects from the experiment , and are said to be progressing well. ; Coming soon <p> Familial hypercholesterolemia . Michigan researchers plan to insert altered genes into three patients with this disease , which causes often- lethal cholesterol levels . The therapy is designed to lower the level of low-density lipoproteins , the so-called " bad " cholesterol , in the bloodstream . <p> AIDS . NCI researchers will begin preliminary work with AIDS patients that could result , as early as next spring , in the first use of gene therapy in AIDS patients . The experiment aims to arm a patient 's white blood cells with genes that will make them resist infection by HIV , the AIDS virus , or prevent HIV from infecting other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for malignant melanoma would be to immunize cancer patients using cancer cells taken from their own tumors and inserting a gene for tumor necrosis factor , which kills tumor cells , or a gene for interleukin-2 , a hormone-like protein that can orchestrate attacks on cancer cells .
