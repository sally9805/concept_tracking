BEHAVIOUR The Timid Tot There 's no shame in being shy By Madeleine Greey When Jennifer Hann was eight years old , she told her parents that she was eager to try ballet class . But before her mother rushed out to buy a new pair of ballet shoes , she took her daughter to observe a class . Soon after , Jennifer expressed second thoughts . Maybe , " suggested Jennifer , " I 'll just take out some books from the library on ballet and learn that way . " You ca n't learn to dance from books ! " responded her mom . Well , the other kids have been taking ballet classes for so long ... I do n't think I can just join in , " Jennifer explained , barely hiding her anxiety . Jennifer 's reaction was no surprise to Brenda and Russell Hann . They had known for several years that their daughter was shy  --  that her first impulse in a new situation was to hide . The key , says Brenda , a Toronto child and family therapist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperament , because it 's not a phase . " Accepting that your child is shy is n't easy for many parents . It 's a label that insinuates failure in a society that clearly equates leadership , assertiveness , dominance , independence and risk - taking with success . When we get locked into perceiving a child as stereotypically shy  --  clingy , fearful , wary  --  then we 're likely to see that child as a loser . Marion Balla , director of the Adlerian Centre for Counselling and Education in Ottawa , is concerned by the label " shy . " She says that no one word describes the whole person and she worries that when parents or teachers label a child as shy , they are putting not only limits on the child 's capabilities , but setting up a negative set of expectations . If you are a parent who was labelled shy as a child , your definition is likely to be coloured by uncomfortable memories . It 's a telling sign that many people automatically pair the words " painfully shy " as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are asking parents to take a second look at shy behaviour and consider it a natural expression of temperament or predisposition . Not only does this approach help to remove the stigma from shyness , but it makes it easier for parents to work with their child . One of the leading researchers on shy behaviour in infants and children is Jerome Kagan of Harvard University . His studies reveal that 15 to 20 percent of all children are born with a tendency to become upset in new and unfamiliar situations . He says these children " inherit a neurochemistry that makes them very excitable . " In fact , the proof is in the physiology : raised blood pressure , dilated pupils and tension in the vocal chords . Research conducted by Stella Chess and Alexander Thomas , professors of psychiatry at New York University Medical Center , is consistent with Kagan 's figures . In their study ( which commenced in 1956 with 133 infants who were tracked until their mid - 20s ) , about 15 percent of the sample responded negatively to new situations and people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child , Chess and Thomas refer to this temperamental pattern as that of the " slow - to - warm - up child . " Accepting a child 's slow - to - warm - up temperament helps us to realize that Johnny is not deliberately refusing to participate in his very expensive swimming classes just to push the proverbial parental button , but because his first and most natural reaction to a new event is to reject it . " It 's affirming for parents to recognize that kids have different styles and temperaments , " says Brenda Hann . But that does n't mean shy kids always need to be treated with kid gloves , according to Balla : " Help your child to see how far he has come instead of how far he has to go . When he realizes how much he has already accomplished , he wo n't feel like he is starting all over again with each new situation . " The important thing about temperament is how parents respond to it , " adds Hann . " The challenge for parents is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole spectrum of who the child is , rather than letting it become the dominating force . " According to Hann , overprotection is the easiest trap parents of shy children can fall into . " Kids do n't learn if they are overprotected and if parents constantly avoid stressful situations for a child . Children must have experience with the right amount of support to obtain a feeling of mastery . " It was that sense of mastery that helped four - year - old Nicole Muyser of Edmonton turn the corner recently to let something more than shyness dominate her personality . Following a family doctor 's recommendation , Wendy and Trevor Muyser decided to place Nicole , then three , into preschool . They were shocked by the change . " No one can believe it ! " marvels her mother . Previously , Nicole had had trouble making friends and interacting with other children . She was very quiet and tentative in social situations . Then came preschool . The secret , it appears , was in the paper , glue and scissors . Nicole and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excelled in this area at school . Before long she was helping her classmates at the crafts table , receiving lots of compliments and making friends . Peer assistance  --  students helping students  --  is a strategy that Edmonton grade - three teacher Linda Mehus uses to help shy children feel more comfortable in the classroom . " I encourage children to encourage each other , " says Mehus . " It is a learned skill . " She 'll often ask a shy child ( whom she knows to excel in a certain area ) to help another child . " I tell them to pull up a chair and work as partners , " she says , adding that " many shy children are quiet in a large group but can act completely differently in a small group or one - on - one . It all depends on how safe they feel . " Many shy students abhor the thought of speaking in front of the class . Yet some subject areas are mainly oral and often evaluated by participation in class discussion . That 's why Mehus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a shy student can shine , such as written reports . " I often find myself reading the shy child 's work out loud to the class , rather than subject him to reading it himself , if he really does n't feel comfortable . " There 's a fine line between helping a shy child feel secure and overprotecting him . It 's also not easy for parents or teachers to know if they are actually encouraging a child or pushing him . While Toronto kindergarten teacher Mary Anne Lawrie admits that she " goes out of her way to make a shy student feel comfortable " she still thinks it 's important that her young charges learn to make eye contact when speaking with an adult . Some of these kids are so shy ... their eyes drop , their head drops , their voice drops ... it 's as if they want to disappear . So I get down on my knees and say something like " Let me see that cute little nose of yours ! ' so that they look into my eyes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch and change this pattern . Otherwise , people will let shy children disappear ... " No one wants his child to feel insignificant or to be treated that way . That 's why it helps to recognize your child 's temperament and make some modifications , both at home and at school . Jennifer Hann , by the way , did end up in ballet class . Once she started to dance , she realized that she could do it , and enjoy it . " I knew that in her heart , Jennifer really wanted to take ballet , " says her mother . " The only thing stopping her was her concern that she would n't fit in . " How to Help Your Child Warm Up ALLOW YOUR CHILD MORE TIME Stretch your clock and let go of some of your deadlines . Give your toddler the lap time and holding time she needs in new social situations . Let your preschooler ease into playgroups slowly . Help an older child recognize her temperamental needs with comments like , " You like to ease into new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How can we plan for this ? " DO N'T PUSH The trick is to know the difference between encouraging and pushing ... and to never stop encouraging . Forcing your child to participate in his first judo class may be pushing . Preparing him through books , discussion and passive observation , before actually trying the class , is encouraging . GIVE WORDS TO THE FEELINGS Many shy children ca n't find the words they need . They clam up and freeze . Start young by helping toddlers with words like " you feel scared right now " or " you need more time . " Remind your child of what he can do , e.g. " Getting used to new things is n't easy for you but you 've done it many times before . Remember when ... " ADVOCATE FOR YOUR CHILD 'S NEEDS People will tell you that you are spoiling or coddling your child ... but believe , instead , that you are respecting his needs . Ask strangers and well - intentioned relatives to give your infant or toddler the " warm - up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's soccer coach or camp counsellor that your child reacts poorly to rushing . Talk over classroom strategies with your child 's teacher . STAY SOCIAL Help little ones feel comfortable by making your home the place where new faces are introduced initially . Ask your child 's preschool or kindergarten teacher who would be a good match as a playmate for your child . And remember to offer a good role model . If you 're leery of social gatherings , it 's likely your child will be too . RESOURCES The Emotional Life of the Toddler , by Alicia F. Lieberman , Free Press , 1993 .
