IMAX 3-D takes you beyond the image on screen into a cinematic world teeming with sights and sounds . <p> A chilly drizzle falls from the gray sky over Vancouver as the crew of Wings of Courage scurries about the tarmac of small Back Bay Airport to set up the film 's next shot . Technicians carefully arrange lights , the special-effects crew gets into place , and actor Craig Sheffer ( A River Runs Through It ) , wearing a leather flying cap and goggles , climbs into the cockpit of a World War I-era biplane mounted on a giant gimbal . At a signal from director Jean-Jacques Annaud , powerful fans whip the rain into Sheffer 's face , the effects crew rocks the plane wildly to simulate a storm 's buffeting winds , and Sheffer wrestles with the controls in what the script dictates will be a vain attempt to keep the plane airborne . Moments later , Annaud calls " Cut ! " and the crew prepares to film it all over again . <p> Amid the buzz of activity , the focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other factors , nor even Annaud , but instead of hulking , improbably shaped black contraption . A technician hovers constantly nearby to closet the machine as needed , but still the crew eyes it nervously for the first signs of an impending breakdown . This unlikely giant is an IMAX 3-D camera , the only one of its kind , and while Sheffer may play the film 's leading role , it is truly the star of this production . <p> Annaud and company are using the notoriously temperamental camera to shoot the first IMAX 3-D feature film ever . Set in 1930 , it tells the true story of Henri Guillaumet ( Sheffer ) , a flier for a South American airmail company run by Antoine de Sain-Exupery ( Amadeus ' Tom Hulce ) , an adventurer best known as the author of The Little Prince . Henri and his fellow pilots fly mail daily in biplanes over the andes mountains between Santiago de Chile and Buenos Aires , sort of an extremely dangerous early version of Federal Express : The route is so treacherous that roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Andes winter and spends six tortuous days walking through the mountains , delirious with pain , cold , and weariness . He holds no real hope of saving himself ; instead , he 's merely trying to ensure that his body can easily be found so that his wife ( Elizabeth McGovern of Ordinary People ) will receive the money from his life-insurance policy without delay . <p> The Oscar-winning director has wanted to film Guillaumet 's remarkable story for years but considered it too thin to sustain a 90-minute-plus movie . So when Sony Pictures Entertainment asked him to consider making a short IMAX 3-D feature to showcase in a new theater complex it 's building in New York City , Annaud accepted the challenge , convinced that the new format and shorter length  --  Wings clocks in at about 35 minutes  --  was ideal for the tale . <p> And Annaud himself is ideal for the task of bringing an unproven technology to the feature-film world . His movies demonstrate his willingness to take risks professionally : The characters in Quest for Fire spoke only a primitive language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ursine stars , treating humans as only peripheral characters . in addition , Annaud is an avid student of both the history of technology and of film , and he is keenly aware of the crucial role Wings could play in making the IMAX 3-D format either the next logical step in the future of film-making or the latest technological gimmick to fall by the wayside . <p> " History has shown that there are two kinds of filmmakers  --  those happy to have sound and those who fought it , those who welcomed color as something that could make films more realistic , and those who insisted black and white was better . We now look at those who resisted new technology as fools , " Annaud says , standing on the tarmac later that May afternoon as the sun peeks feebly through the clouds . " I do n't want to be looked at as a fool . " <p> IMAX 3-D seems the logical culmination of the IMAX film format . Anyone who 's visited a major science center , museum , or amusement park has probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge screens up to eight stories high , they 're mostly science-oriented documentaries on subjects ranging from space flight to the life cycle of the Serengeti Plain . To fill those huge screens , IMAX films use a very large film frame to create an image ten times larger  --  and much sharper  --  than the 35-millimeter frame used for the vast majority of feature films . Like conventional films , most IMAX films are two-dimensional . But recently , Imax Corporation , which developed and owns the technology that bears its name , has begun making 3-D films  --  again , all documentaries  --  in the huge IMAX format . Chances are most movie-goers have n't seen one of these films  --  only seven of the world 's 100-plus IMAX theaters can show IMAX 3-D films , and just four movies have been made so far . The newest IMAX 3-D theater , Sony 's 650-seat complex in New York City , opens in November , with an exclusive seven-month run of Wings of Courage , the first IMAX 3-D narrative film , slated to begin early next year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doubles them  --  literally . The basics of 3-D filming have n't changed since the 1950s , when 3-D was introduced via a variety of grade-B horror flicks . The 3-D shooting process mimics the way we see , filming everything twice with the distance between the two cameras approximately the same as that between a person 's eyes  --  two and one-half inches . The two cameras , however . do n't sit side by side ; instead , one camera is mounted horizontally , looking through a two-way mirror at the image directly ahead , and the other points down into the mirror , filming the image reflected upward . <p> Three-dimensional movies earned a bad reputation with audiences for various reasons : cheap glasses , bad positioning of objects within the 3-D space , poor illumination , shaky cameras and projectors , all of which combined to produce headaches , eye strain , and queasy stomachs . Aiming to solve at least the shaky-camera problem , Canada 's National Film Board and ISTEC , a manufacturer of gyro-stabilized platforms that keep movie cameras rock-steady during all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gyro-stabilized camera set-up called a 3-D Rig . Like ISTEC 's camera platforms , the 3-D Rig had to be suspended from a crane or a helicopter . In the late 1980s , Imax Corporation and ISTEC created a newer version of the gyro-stabilized 3-D Rig and used it to shoot two 3-D films . But filmmakers and engineers alike found the rig too bulky , and so they sacrificed the gyro and simply mounted the 3-D Rig on a tripod , which , surprisingly , worked just fine for most shots . <p> A couple of years later , Imax Corporation decided that it wanted to be able to make 3-D films in its newest film format , called IMAX SOLIDO , which uses a fisheye lens to capture a 150-degree field of view . But if such lenses were installed on the existing rig , they 'd actually see part of the rig . For SOLIDO , the engineers figured out , the two cameras ' lenses must be side by side . They worked for nearly four years on an entirely new 3-D camera , which shoots both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenses . Unlike other 3-D cameras , however , it does n't contain two complete and separate cameras . Instead , it has two lenses and two film movements inside a single camera housing . The image viewed by each lens reflects off a mirror and then onto the unexposed film in each of the two movements . This set-up actually produces a better image than most 3-D cameras because each lens and movement can capture most of the available light , according to Claude Richard , manager of the camera department at the IMAX Technology Center . The two-way mirror , or beamsplitter , used in conventional 3-D Rigs splits the light that enters the cameras , reflecting half to one lens and half to the other . <p> Although this prototype " dual-film-strip " camera turned out about a third smaller than its predecessors , it still amounted to a handful , to say the least . And was it up to the rigors of a feature-film shooting schedule ? Even its developers did n't think so , Annaud says . " Imax told me that if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he relates . Clearly , such a leisurely pace would simply not work for a feature production , which normally calls for directors to shoot between 10 and 12 " set-ups , " or shots , each day . So in June 1993 , Annaud took the dual-filmstrip camera and the larger IMAX 3-D tripod-mounted rig model ( which was also used on Wings ) , along with a small crew , to Telluride , Colorado , for four days , where at 13,000 feet up in the mountains , he filmed a man walking . The resulting footage told no story , but it said volumes to Annaud and his collaborators . " We had to prove to ourselves  --  because nobody believed it  --  that we could do four or five set-ups a day , " explains Charis Horton , Wings ' producer . " We did twenty-six shots in four days . " <p> " Telluride taught me that I should not listen to the people who said it was n't possible , " Annaud says as the crew rattles busily around him , setting up an interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were cumbersome cameras , but I could do a regUlar movie . I would have to struggle to make it work , but I would have something very astonishing at the end . And it told me as well that I could n't dream of doing more than five or six set-ups a day ; I 'm doing 4.7 as an average . " <p> When it comes to the IMAX 3-D cameras , " cumbersome " is a kind word . Even the dual-filmstrip model is an absolute behemoth compared to the sleek , relatively unobtrusive 35'millimeter cameras used for conventional films . The camera 's size affects every aspect of the production . " We 've been building the sets for these cameras , " Annaud says , " and I had to think in advance where I could put the camera angle to make the set accommodate them and not the reverse . " <p> In many ways , the size of the camera is the least of its problems . It 's a prototype in every sense of the word : It breaks down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be whisked in . ( For various reasons , the IMAX 3-D rig ca n't be used for many of Wings ' shots . ) While filming in the mountains , after spending hours hauling all the equipment and crew members up by helicopter to the location above the tree line , " once every three days , I would set my camera , get ready to shoot , say roll , and  --  " Annaud mimics the grinding sound of the camera breaking down . " You have this full unit that 's been struggling for you , and the actors are emotionally prepared , and that 's your day . So that 's a terribly frustrating thing . " <p> During a three-day visit to the set , I watch the crew spend all morning and much of an afternoon setting up and shooting a very complex scene in which a thunderstorm rages outside Henri 's house , lightning flashing closer and closer . The-lighting inside the house must be absolutely perfect , and a couple of crew members have to pull the heavy camera back a few feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Off a light . Filming this scene once presents enough of a challenge , but this is the second time around . The first time , a screw had worked loose and closed the shutter on one of the two lenses inside the camera housing , effectively shooting the scene in 2-D . The crew had no idea the camera had malfunctioned until they watched the rushes days later at Vancouver 's IMAX 3-D theater . <p> Because the only place you can see IMAX 3-D footage in 3-D is in such a theater , Annaud has no way of knowing exactly what he 's shooting . Indeed , the camera does n't even have a viewfinder to look through . Instead , Annaud and cinematographer Robert Fraisse , nominated for an Oscar for his work on Annaud 's The Lover , peer at a grainy black-and-white image on a tiny video monitor plugged into the camera . " We 're blind , " Annaud says simply as he discusses " the aggravation of not seeing on the viewfinder what I am going to project on a screen the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see , the actors ca n't hear . The camera makes so much noise that during a dream sequence I watch being filmed in Saint-Exupery 's office . with Sheffer just a few feet away from Hulce , neither actor can catch more than a few words of what the other says . Hulce jokes about it as he views the scene on the video monitor and hears for the first time the lines Sheffer has uttered . The actors will need to do extensive " looping "  --  speeking their lines again in a studio , synchronizing them perfectly with the movements of their lips onscreen . While looping is a fairly common practice on Hollywood features , looping virtually an entire film is n't . <p> Even as simple a task as loading film presents a problem when filming in IMAX 3-D . The film magazines used on Wings hold only a few thousand feet of film , giving roughly three minutes of shooting time usually two to three takes . " When it 's dry , you can reload in ten minutes with two or three people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the National Film Board who 's working as stereographer on this production . " On a standard camera , if an operator takes more than a minute to reload , he 's considered slow . " <p> " When you have momentum , " Annaud explains , " then your actors do one take , two takes , three takes , and then about take five or six or seven , they have it , and then it 's done . Here , between takes three and four , I have to reload . I lose a scene like that every week . " <p> Just getting a scene onto celluloid can be difficult enough when filming in IMAX 3-D , but Annaud and McNabb must also worry about exactly what that scene looks like  --  and not just in terms of lighting and costurning . When an object appears out of place in a conventional 2-D film , a moviegoer may be annoyed ; in a 3-D film , he or she can end up literally nauseated . Bad stereography  --  placement of objects within the 3-D space  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that viewers experience during inferior 3-D films . As stereographer , McNabb evaluates each shot , making sure that the shot composition and camera alignment do n't cause the viewer 's eyes to converge excessively , a problem that can result from placing objects or actors too close to the camera , or to diverge , which is completely unnatural . <p> Sometimes filmmakers working in 3-D play games with the camera and with the viewer 's eyes , moving the camera lenses farther apart or closer together to make things onscreen look smaller or larger , respectively , than they actually are . Annaud , however , has shied away from these visual tricks , electing to present images as naturally as possible . That includes virtually eliminating the old standby of 3-D films : objects surging out of the screen toward the moviegoer for no practical reason whatsoever . " Why do I need to have the actors throwing things at me ? " Annaud asks . " I mean , it 's silly . In movies , you do n't have things thrown at you . I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that because it was a movie with sound , you had to sing all the time . " <p> Rather than shooting objects out of the screen at moviegoers , Annaud wants to bring viewers into the 3-D space created onscreen . IMAX in particular makes that possible , he says , because its clarity and size create an image amazingly close to reality . " It puts you in a situation where you can believe more in what you see . In IMAX 3-D , if you have a wide landscape and it 's very windy , you would see the grass moving shh-shh-shh , so you would feel wind  --  I should say , the texture of wind  --  while in a regular 2-D movie , there 's no way I can show you that . I have to have a tree bending in front of you to give you the idea  --  not the feeling but the idea  --  of wind , " Annaud continues . " You never feel it on your skin . In IMAX 3-D , when you see dust , you close your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornea . " <p> Sheffer found himself taken aback by the reality of the IMAX 3-D image , particularly when he watched footage of himself . " It was the first time that I 've seen myself the way I imagine others see me , " he says . " Physically , the image on the screen is rounder , so it makes the character 's personality rounder and more real somehow . It was almost like sitting beside myself  --  very dreamlike and yet very real . " <p> Of course , having a film image simulate reality so perfectly opens an unexpected can of worms for a feature film crew . After all , what they 're filming is most definitely not reality . " Filmmaking is about cheating , " Annaud concedes. " and here we almost can not cheat . " Everything the IMAX camera sees ends up onscreen in crisp , clear color  --  and it sees everything . " In IMAX , if you can see it with your eyes , you can see it on the screen , " says producer Horton , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't have fake anything . ff you can see it 's fake with your eye , it 'll look fake on the screen . " <p> To make the sets look as authentic as possible , the set dressers on Wings searched for as many real set decorations and props as possible , unearthing vintage Argentinian newspapers and old calendars  --  all in Spanish . The wardrobe crew dressed the cast only in natural materials available in 1930 , keeping an eagle eye out for seemingly minor anomalies such as plastic buttons that would stand out in IMAX like a wristwatch on a Roman centurion . Such attention to detail added considerably to Wings ' budget , which Herton coyly characterizes only as " more than a Merchant-Ivory picture but less than Cliffhanger . " <p> The audience will have time to take a leisurely look at all of those carefully chosen items , because the average shot in Wings lasts at least 10 seconds  --  a veritable eternity in these MTV , quick-cut times . " What you want to do in an IMAX theater is look around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his co-writer , Alain Godard ( The Name of the Rose ) , deliberately wrote the script as more of a stage play than a film , with relatively few cuts and none of them fast . Sent to Comercon in his youth to inaugurate a film industry there , Annaud draws a parallel between natives seeing movies for the first time and modern audiences unfamiliar with IMAX 3-D . " The natives would always prefer a long scene because there was time to make up their minds : ' Oh , this is a building , and this is a cloud , ' and so on . Editing was disturbing for them . We are those primitives with this new medium in 3-D . That 's why I 'm doing slow movements , because then the perspective is changing slowly and the viewer can feel comfortable . " ( For the same reason , Annaud decided to make Wings a relatively short film ; he anticipates making two more 30- to 40-minute films , one about Saint-Exupery and another about heroic aviator Jean Mirmoz ( played by Val Kilmer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three together into a full-length IMAX 3-D feature . ) <p> Virtually a walking history of film , Annaud a moment later likens the unhurried look of Wings of Courage to a Hitchcock movie . " He would do scenes two minutes , three minutes , sometimes the whole roll  --  eleven minutes . It has an advantage : It takes you to the real tempo of life . Most movies are shot rather quickly and in a way where you can manipulate your reality because of the amount of coverage "  --  shooting a scene from many different angles so that the director can choose among them in the editing room . " Here my manipulation is quite different . I have to build it in with the lighting , with the framing . It requires much more attention at this stage . If I do a mistake , I 'm cooked , " he says with a laugh . <p> Wings ' visual style may be old-fashioned at heart , but its sound is high-tech all the way . Besides the six channels of top-notch stereo sound broadcast through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three-dimensional sound through a special headset called the Personal Sound Environment ( PSE ) distributed to each moviegoer . Developed by Imax affiliate Sonics Associates of Birmingham , Alabama , the PSE incorporates both IMAX 3-D glasses and tiny speakers mounted between the lenses of the glasses and the wearer 's ears . The key to producing 3-D sound lies in the unique placement of those speakers , the result of about two years of research , according to Stevan Saunders , Sonics ' director of research and development . " In a 3-D film , the visuals follow you around the room , no matter where you are , " he says . " Sound out of loudspeakers , even the best loud-speakers , does n't do that . You can do really well at producing 3-D sound out of loudspeakers with the listener in the right seat . What we 've done is basically attached that spot to the listener 's head . " <p> Ironically , the recording technology used in conjunction with the PSE dates back 50 years . This technique , known as binaural recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human head to capture sound the way we actually hear it . When recording sound effects binaurally for a film sound-track , for example , the sound-effects techniclap duplicates in the studio the movements of the actor or object producing those sounds onscreen . <p> Wings will employ the PSE 3-D sound sparingly , primarily to voice Henri 's thoughts as he wanders through the icy landscape . Although the soundtrack work had n't yet begun at press time , Saunders predicts that Sheffer will per haps whisper into the ear-mounted mikes while circling the head to create the illusion of someone 's thoughts coming from everywhere and nowhere at once . <p> Impossibly crisp images eight stories high , so real you reach out to touch them , three-dimensional sound that seems to come from inside your head  --  they 're certainly technological advances over current moviemaking methods , but are they the future of film , as sound and color were so many years ago ? Annaud firmly believes so . " I still think it 's impossible that in twenty years , people will still go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than television , " he maintains . " Because even bad television is going to be so much better . Movie theaters will have to offer a wider screen with more definition , " whether it 's IMAX or one of its competitors on the wide-screen front . <p> Theaters , studios , and filmmakers all play pivotal , interdependent roles in determining the future of wide-format films . Owners must decide that building a huge . expensive IMAX-scate theater ( all of the competing wide-screen formats require supersize theaters as well ) is worth their while , which it wo n't be unless there is a good selection of quality wide-screen films to show . It 's up to studios  --  many of which are in the theater business themselves , like Sony , which owns the Loew 's theater chain , now called Sony Theatres  --  to greenlight those films and to persuade top-name directors such as Annaud to make them . Will all the pieces fall together ? <p> " What I see onscreen is just so exciting that I would take it as a personal failure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world , " Annaud insists . But as a student of the history of technology , he also recognizes that there are many forces at work here . " lt 's fabulous to see the enormous resistance to an invention by the establishment , " he muses . " But when the compass was invented , it changed navigation . When printing was invented , it led to the collapse of the church . These are the consequences . <p> " There is nothing in the history of man where an invention makes it better that it does not become the standard . This is a fact . This is evolution . This is transformation .
