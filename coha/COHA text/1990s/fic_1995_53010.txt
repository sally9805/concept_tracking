Call me Bartleby . Some time ago , just after my brother died , I was laid off from my job writing obits at a nowhere newspaper called The Multnomah Messenger . <p> Not having much else going for me , I hooked up with a greeting card company and got assigned to a division called Eternal Messages . We contracted with people to send cards and letters to their survivors after they died . <p> I was a ghost writer . Kind of . Full name : Bartholomew Lee Burns , but I still did n't get a by-line . I wrote ' em , and dead people signed ' em . <p> It was a weird job , sure , but it was a living . And listen , we got a lot of people that were just tickled by the idea of sending birthday , anniversary , Christmas , whatever , greetings to their loved ones after they had croaked . We charged twenty-five bucks per message , fifty if you wanted them custom written . <p> We came and went , we ghost writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any one time , writing dead letters . That 's what we called them when there were n't clients around to hear us talking . The post office has a place for dead letters , only these were different , these were letters from dead people . Missives from the other side . Quoting one of my own efforts , they went something like this : <p> preMy Dearest Angela:On this most joyous of days , Please know that I am with youEven though I 'm not around physically , I will never leave you. I pray for the day we can be together again.Merry Christmas , Love , Always and forever , ( and on this subject I know what I 'm talking about , trust me )  --  Max Okay , so I 'm no Herman Melville , as my brother never tired of telling me . And I guess it is kind of sick in that one line where Mr. Max Sturges implies he 's happily anticipating the day Angela kicks off , but the customer is always right , right ? And Max liked it . Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less like that one , and told us to keep sending them every Christmas until those thirty years were up or until poor Angela joined him in that better place we 'll all end up in some day . And not only Christmas . Ol ' Max sprung for thirty wedding anniversaries , thirty of Angela 's birthdays , thirty Mother 's Days , thirty Valentine 's days and a few random out-of-the-blue , for-no-reason , just-cause-I-love-you cards sprinkled across those three decades . <p> He was feeling moved by the spirits that day he came in and set the whole thing up . He knew he was dying . Wanted to leave his Angela something that counted . Something from the heart . Max was a real sentimentalist . <p> I wish I could say the same for Angela . She called me soon after Max 's contract kicked in . Well , she called EM . I just answered the phone . <p> " Eternal Messages , " I said . " Bart speaking . " <p> " Is this the place that sends letters from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kind of like a mouse voice . Soft . <p> " Epistles from the passed away , that 's right . " <p> Then the line went real quiet for a while . Only the hum of the phone line in my ear . I waited a few seconds , tapping my pencil on the desk . " Ma'am ? " <p> " I 'd prefer not receiving these cards , " she said . <p> Do n't think I had n't come across this sort of thing before . My brother always said stuff like that . Once he said he did n't want to go on . Said he decided he 'd rather not live . He just preferred it that way . I laughed when he said it . I did n't laugh at Angels though . I had my speech ready . <p> " Not send them ? " I said in my most hurt voice . " Your wonderful husband wanted us to send them , and we 're going to abide by his wishes for as long as you live became he loved you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still loves you . " Well , that and the fact that I got a twenty percent commission for every card I wrote . But I did n't collect if we did n't send them . <p> " I told you , " said Angels , " I prefer not receiving these messages . I 'm sure some people like this sort of thing but I do n't . Max is dead . I do n't want any phony cards and letters from your business pretending to be from him . " <p> I cleared my throat . " It 's really uncanny , " I said . " He told me you would be like this , but he also told me that I should n't listen to you . That you would see things his way and you would come to love his messages . " <p> Angela breathed into the phone . I pressed on . <p> " I 'll bet you 've saved the ones you 've already received , have n't you ? " <p> Angels said nothing . <p> " Sure you did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save them all . I know you will . The memories of you and Max , how could you lose that ? " <p> " But he 's not sending them ! " <p> " Technically , that 's true . But he arranged to have them sent . He wanted you to have them . He truly did . " <p> More breathing . <p> I waited . <p> " I 'm too tired to argue with you , " she said . <p> After she hung up I wondered if my arguments convinced her and I remembered the night I sat up with my brother from midnight to dawn explaining to him that life was good , that his depression would pass , that he should prefer to live . I knew I convinced him . I could tell because he laughed at my lame jokes and told me I was wasting my vast talents writing obituaries when I could be working in the classified ads department . Ha ha . A lame joke of his own , but it was a sign he was okay . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work log for the day . There was a Father 's Day card , and a few birthdays to do , but my heart was n't in it . I knocked off early and went home and forgot about Angela and Max and my brother . <p> A few days later I found an envelope on my desk bearing the following address : <p> preMr . Maxwell Sturgesc/o Eternal Messages DepartmentSignature Card CompanyBox 1275Portland , OR 97204 I recognized Angela 's return address in the upper left hand comer and stared at the envelope for some time . Maybe Angela Sturges had a sense of humor after all . Or maybe she was trying to say something . I wanted to open the envelope , but stopped myself . It was n't addressed to me . It was addressed to  --  a dead man . <p> My phone buzzed . I picked it up . <p> " Burns ? " It was my boss , the owner of the company . <p> " Yes Mr. Yost . " <p> " Is there a problem with the Sturges account ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think so . " <p> " What 's that letter about ? " <p> My collar suddenly seemed uncomfortably tight . <p> " Nothing Mr. Yost . " <p> " Have we done something to upset Mrs. Sturges ? " <p> I pondered that one for a couple of seconds . Only if you count sending her mail from the great beyond that she did n't want to get . But we were only doing what we were supposed to do . <p> " No , " I said . <p> Yost grunted . " What 's next for her ? " <p> " We just sent Christmas . Her birthday is in May and their anniversary is July , so Valentine 's is next . " <p> " Make it a good one , " said Yost . " Give it your all . We want to win her back . I have a feeling she 's upset . " <p> " Yes Mr. Yost . What should I do with the letter ? " <p> " Send it back as undeliverable . And whatever you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Sweat dripped off my forehead . I looked around and found the other ghosts staring at me . They had heard the whole thing . I smiled . " Got a funny one , " I said . <p> They nodded and turned back to their work . We were not a real friendly bunch . Making up cheerful greetings from corpses day after day can make anyone kind of antisocial . <p> I crossed out the address , wrote " return to sender " on it , and put it in my out basket . <p> I did n't hear from Angela Sturges for several more days and thought the whole matter had been taken care of . <p> That 's when the flowers came . Same deal as before . Addressed to Max in care of our company . A dozen roses they were , with the following card : <p> preMy dearest Max , I 'd very much prefer not hearing fromyou again , if it 's all the same withyou . Love you lots , Angela She was no Emily Dickinson , but who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it a kind of youthful tone . <p> Valentine 's Day was still over a month away , but I decided ol ' Max needed to send something to his sweetheart pronto . I pulled out a fresh legal pad and stared writing down some lines . <p>  --  Thanks for the flowers . <p>  --  Hey ! The flowers were wonderful . <p>  --  You always knew I loved roses . <p> Lines like that . I wished I was still writing obits . <p> I tried a few more . <p>  --  How thoughtful of you to send flowers . <p>  --  Your flowers were so wonderful I could just die ! ! ! <p> I ground my pencil point into the paper and stared off into space . <p> At home that afternoon I took out my brother 's unopened letter , the one I got in the mail three days after I convinced him life was worth living , and two days after his neighbor found him dead in his apartment . An empty bottle ot sleeping pills and a drained bottle of whiskey were arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore the following address : <p> preBart L.B.c/o Mr. Herman MelvilleThe Multnomah MessengerPortland , Oregon I turned it over and slid my thumb under the flap , breaking the seal . I pulled out the yellow lined page inside and unfolded it . There was a short message in my brother 's handwriting . <p> Dear Bart : <p> You tried , but it 's hopeless . I 'd really prefer not living anymore . I hope you understand and I hope this wo n't keep you from living . Bye . <p> I read the note several times , then held it in my hand while night slowly leaked into the day . <p> The next morning I arrived at the office and went straight to my desk . I pulled out a legal pad and started writing . <p> " A memorial service for Maxwell Sturges of no fixed address was performed today in the offices of Signature Greetings of Portland , Oregon . <p> " Mr. Sturges died a second time due to family preference . He had been needlessly and thoughtlessly resurrected by the greeting card firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death . He was less than a year dead . <p> " Mr. Sturges 's chief activity during his brief resurrection was sending his wife annoying cards and letters , and providing a small income for an employee at Signature Greetings . <p> " He is still survived by his wife Angela . <p> " Cremation took place at Signature . " <p> After I finished I read it over . Still had the touch . <p> I tore off the page and stuffed it in an envelope , addressed it to Angela , stamped it , and slipped it into my jacket pocket . <p> Then I pulled out all the material on Maxwell Sturges : his contract , the notes I took at his pre-death interview , the disk where I kept the verses I had sent , the ones I had worked on for future mailings , all of it . I tossed it into a trash can by my desk and lit a match and dropped it into the can . <p> I waited for the smoke to billow . Some of my colleagues came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon the flames started to consume the paper and plastic . Thick black smoke began to fill the room . I picked up the flowers that Angela Sturges had sent to her husband . The edges of the petals were already brown and dried out . I tossed the roses into the trash can just as the sprinkler system cut in and began to soak us all . <p> I held a pad over the trash can so that the water would n't extinguish the flames . <p> The smoke reminded me of dreams obscured , of visions blurred . <p> Yost came out of his office , red-faced and screaming . " Burns ! What the hell are you doing ? Put out that fire . " <p> Someone ran up with a fire extinguisher and covered the trash can with white powder . It looked like a box of baking soda had exploded . <p> I would have preferred to let the flames bum even longer , but some things are not in one 's control . In the streams of water coming down on us all I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bent down , and picked up the trash can . I got white powder all over my shirt and pants . <p> I walked out of the building got in my car with the trash can and drove to the post office . I spread the ashes representing the second short life of Maxwell Sturges over the lawn near the blue mailboxes marked " IN TOWN , " " OUT OF TOWN , " and " METERED MAIL ONLY . " <p> Then I dropped the envelope with Max 's obit into the out of town mailbox . <p> I was pretty sure Angela Sturges would appreciate the information . <p> <p> By Mario Milosevic <p> Mario Milosevic wrote his first story for Fantasy &; Science Fiction as a response to his father 's death in 1990 .
