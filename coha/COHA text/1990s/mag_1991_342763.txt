Americans routinely register their cars , bikes and dogs , generally without a yelp of protest . So why not their semiautomatic assault rifles and handguns , which may not always be as lethal as their autos but are certainly more so than their 10-speeds and terriers ? Because , argued the National Rifle Association in a suit to throw out a 1989 California law that , in effect , banned possession of unregistered assault guns , the U.S. Constitution guarantees every citizen an unrestricted right to bear arms . California gun owners seem to agree . As a year-end deadline passed , only 18,000 of perhaps 200,000 such weapons had been registered . <P> California outlawed the purchase of semiautomatic guns as of Jan. 1 , 1990 , but those acquired before June 1989 could be kept if they were registered . The law seemed a big defeat for the NRA , as did a subsequent ruling by Federal Judge Edward Dean Price in Fresno . Dismissing the NRA challenge , Price ruled that the Constitution permits each state to impose its own restrictions on gun ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unregistered guns and charge their owners with a felony carrying up to a year in prison , the NRA may still win a victory by default unless the law is vigorously enforced .
