<p> Standing in a pasture of browning grass , Victor Manuel Vanegas coos to a herd of skinny cows before recounting the day in May when the narcotics police dropped their calling card : a potent herbicide sprayed on his fields . " It had to be a mistake , I 've never planted coca on my land , never , " says the graying campesino ( peasant ) who 's been farming in this hotbed of narcotics production and guerrilla activity in southern Colombia for three decades . But the spread of narcotics production to areas like Guaviare is a symptom of a failure to develop forms of legitimate and sustaining production for campesinos with no love for coca or heroin poppies - but with a will to survive . A failure to address the development needs of marginalized regions like Guaviare is at the root of both the guerrilla war and rising drug production , many observers say . And so , until the former is addressed , both of the latter are likely to continue . " Now I 've got a bad rice field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Vanegas says , crumpling up a handful of grass like autumn leaves . " It 's a mistake I 'm having to live with . " Experiences like Vanegas 's throughout the coca and heroin-poppy-growing regions of Colombia hint at both the limited successes and overlying failure of Colombia 's drug-crop eradication program . Some peasants like Vanegas may stay away from coca , the plant whose leaves make cocaine , for fear of spraying or trouble with the law . But , overall , the total area of coca production has climbed sharply every year since 1992 , from 91,000 to about 200,000 acres today . The eradication program began in 1985 and has expanded steadily since then with heavy backing from the US . But now it is coming under tough scrutiny as Colombia - spurred by new President Andres Pastrana - moves toward serious negotiations to end a three-decade-old civil war . Narcotics production is intimately intertwined with Colombia 's long guerrilla war because it is a principal source of income for the war 's combatants : the guerrillas , paramilitary groups , and - peasants here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trafficking is the fuel that keeps this conflict burning , " says Augusto Ramirez Ocampo , a former Colombian foreign minister and member of the National Peace Commission . " Peace negotiations will have to be based on a development plan , " Mr. Ramirez says , " and that plan will have to include real alternatives to narcotics cultivation . " But not a plan based on crop spraying . " That has n't worked , " he says , pointing out that , after the spraying of more than a half-million acres over the last 13 years , total illegal-crop acreage ( including coca , marijuana , and heroin poppies ) has risen from 20,000 in 1985 to about 250,000 today . Some of the increase in Colombia has followed important decreases in planting in Peru and Bolivia , according to US officials . Yet US policy on spraying seems to acknowledge the limitations of its effectiveness : While the US maintains that spraying large plantation-style fields is effective , the usefulness of spraying small plots intermixed with other crops is considered questionable . Along the dirt highways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ del Guaviare , everyone encountered by a recent visitor had felt the impact of the region 's narcotics activity - either by direct involvement in the coca-production process , or through some effect of the government 's efforts against illegal crops . A taxi driver , a paramilitary soldier collecting " taxes " from cars passing his outpost , and a poor campesino returning to his isolated farm on horseback - these are just three examples . And , even though what was simply called here the " bonanza " of coca production a decade ago is over , all three agree illegal crops will continue to grow until other income sources are developed . <p> Leonardo the deliveryman The taxi driver is " Leonardo " ( none of the three wanted his real name used for fear of reprisal ) . He moved to San Jose from a more distant settlement two years ago after his 75-acre farm , part of it planted with coca , was sprayed with defoliants . " Before that happened I employed as many as 30 campesinos at a time , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guerrillas or the paramilitaries as a way to make money . But I sold the farm and moved here . I consider myself a war refugee . " But the move did not extricate Leonardo from the drug business . " I could n't support a family just on taxi fares , " he says , " so I went into the delivery business . " What he delivers are all the products that coca producers need to turn their lush green leaves into coca paste - cement , gasoline , ammonia , and other chemicals . He replaced his taxi 's conventional 20-gallon tank with a 40-gallon tank that passes both military and paramilitary checkpoints undetected . Leonardo sees his activity as simple necessity . But he worries that the spraying campaign , while it has recently reduced total drug-crop acreage in Gauviare , ends up making guerrillas of the young campesinos put out of work . That 's not exactly what happened with " Ruben . " Manning a paramilitary roadblock just two miles up a dirt highway from a similar Army checkpoint , the young former farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm he cut out of the jungle was sprayed two years ago : " I had 3.5 hectares about 8.5 acres of coca , but it was right with the yucca and plantains and corn , so everything was hit . " Now Ruben makes about $ 350 a month - an enviable wage for San Jose - as a paramilitary soldier and tax collector . The driver of a jeep loaded with cement bags and fertilizers slows to a stop and pays him 20,000 pesos ( $ 12 ) without batting an eye . <p> Ruben the paramilitary " We do go out on night missions to fight the guerrillas , " Ruben says casually , " but I 'd put down my weapons tomorrow if the guerrillas did the same - and if I had some other work to do . " Having other work to do is all it would take to get most campesinos to give up planting illegal crops , they say . " I ca n't get anything I grow to market , no roads come near my farm , " says " Salvador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his land . " But with the coca I grow , there 's always someone to come to me to buy it . " <p> Salvador the coca planter Salvador has only three of his 170 acres in coca , but he says that 's the only part of his farm that brings him income . " I 'm not tied to that plot of coca , " he says , " but you 've got to have some money coming in to live on . " Still , the attractiveness of growing coca is reduced by rising costs , he says . The $ 500 in profit his coca field brought him three years ago is now only about $ 250 . Surprisingly , but like many other campesinos here , Salvador thinks the US involvement in Colombia is necessary - both to stop the very narcotics production he 's involved in , and to help bring peace . " But it should be an assistance that really does some good , like help developing new crops that we can sell or building roads so we can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This cursed spraying is n't going to do it .
