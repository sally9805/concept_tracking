Every day , 40 million Americans show a remarkable faith in the integrity of strangers , entrusting their hard-earned savings  --  and their hopes for a financially secure future  --  to the largely anonymous professional money managers who run mutual funds . And despite some embarrassing blemishes in the go-go funds era of the late 1960s , the industry has earned that trust during the past 50 years , building a reputation as champion of the little guy in the often brutal global financial markets . Here 's the ultimate proof of small investors ' high esteem : Over the past four years alone , the amount of money Americans have in mutual funds more than doubled to a staggering $2.1 trillion . But since the beginning of the year , several worrisome episodes  --  involving the abuse of derivatives , the ethics of fund managers , the reporting of inaccurate net asset values and other issues  --  have raised questions that could erode the industry 's bond with investors . " Trust is the backbone of our market , " said Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I think perceptions of fairness are more important today than ever before because many of the dollars that have gone into funds lately have come from certificates of deposit and bank accounts . " ( For more about chairman Levitt 's plans to protect investors , see the box on page 74 . ) Industry officials contend that investors have no reason to worry . " If anything , these minor blips show how well we do at maintaining our standards , " says Matthew Fink , president of the 5,794-member Investment Company Institute , the main fund industry trade association . Yet one prominent fund watcher believes that the torrent of dollars may have distracted some companies from their real mission . " The emphasis the past few years seems to have moved from portfolio management to selling a product , " says Kathryn McGrath , formerly the SEC 's top fund regulator and now a securities lawyer in Washington , D.C. " Some people have forgotten they 're in a fiduciary business , which is disturbing . " MONEY has interviewed more than 30 fund industry officials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts to get answers to the six questions investors now have about mutual funds . We also offer advice on protecting yourself and what steps regulators and the funds themselves should take to ensure shareholders are being served . We believe that what we learned will help you become a smarter fund investor  --  and ultimately a richer one . HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER MY MIND IS TRULY AS SAFE AS SAYS IT IS ? * In the race to stand out among today 's nearly 5,000 funds , an increasing number of fund managers invested in highly volatile securities that can boost their portfolios ' returns  --  but also subject them to sizable losses . For example , managers of some aggressive small-capitalization funds have bought highly speculative issues of new and untested companies that do not trade on major stock exchanges . " These stocks are another notch up the risk scale from what you would expect to find in small-cap funds , " says editor John Rekenthaler of the Chicago fund rating newsletter Morningstar Mutual Funds . " They can go to zero . " In bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from the arcane securities known as derivatives  --  complex instruments , such as inverse floaters and structured notes , whose value is based on some underlying asset , commodity or interest-rate index . Fund ranking firm Lipper Analytical Services estimates that more than half of the 3,800 or so fixed-income and money-market funds had used some form of derivatives to hedge their bets or boost yield . When rates began to shoot up starting in February , derivatives soured far faster than the pros expected . As a result , many investors were stunned by sharp losses in supposedly conservative short-term-bond funds during the first half of the year . Among the hardest-hit funds were $730 million Paine Webber Short-term US . Government Income , whose D shares lost 6.2% for the year to Aug. 1 , and $607 million Piper Jaffray Institutional Government Income , off 22.5% . Both funds remain heavily invested in derivatives , which constitute a whopping 72% of the Piper fund 's portfolio and 24% of Paine Webber 's . What 's more , about 20 money-market funds had to be bailed out by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example uncovered by MONEY : Chicago 's Northern Trust Co. had to buy $3.5 million worth of so-called cost-of-funds-index derivatives ( known as COFI or " coffee floaters " ) this year from the three Benchmark money funds it manages to shore them up . Analysts note that some funds are still carrying derivatives on their books at prices 5% to 20% above what they would fetch if they were actually sold . Says Andy Kowalczyk , a partner at Descap Securities , a New York City firm that specializes in mortgage-backed bonds and derivatives : " Managers are still in denial about their derivative holdings . " Bruised shareholders have ample reason to feel betrayed . In most cases , even a careful inspection of a fund 's prospectus might not have alerted them to the potential time bombs , because the disclosure is worded so opaquely . Take a gander at this section from the prospectus of the Piper Jaffray fund mentioned above : " The Fund may also invest in inverse or reverse floating CMOs . Inverse or reverse floating CMOs constitute a tranche of a CMO with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an applicable index such as LIBOR ... " Got that ? Even reading a fund 's portfolio might not have revealed the synthetics . Since funds are required to file their holdings only in their semiannual and annual reports , some managers engage in the sneaky technique called window dressing-dumping securities just before public filing dates so that they need not be reported , then buying them back later . " It 's like telling an athlete what day he 's going to be tested for drugs , " says Don Phillips , publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds . What you can do , When investing in small-cap and aggressive growth funds , ask a fund representative how much of the portfolio is in stocks with market capitalizations of $10 million or less . If the fund keeps 5% or more in such issues , invest only if you are prepared to accept outsize risks . The only sure way to learn about your fund 's use of derivatives is to question a representative directly . Remember , some derivatives can actually lower the riskiness of a fund-as when currency futures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dampen possible losses from currency fluctuations . So what you really want to know is whether your fund is using derivatives that are designed to pump up the fund 's yield and , if so , how much the fund 's value can drop if interest rates rise , say , one percentage point . Avoid funds that invest more than 5% of their assets in such derivatives . Or you can go with funds that have strict policies against or largely avoid using toxic derivatives , such as Vanguard Fixed-Income Short-term Corporate ( 800-851-4999 ) , up 2.3% for the year to August , Invesco Intermediate Government Bond ( 800-525-8085 ) , up 1.1 , and Franklin Short/Intermediate U.S. Government Securities ( 2.25% load ; 800-342-5236 ) , up 0.3% . What the industry should do , Barry Barbash , director of investment management at the SEC , says the commission has already restricted the use of some derivatives in moneymarket funds and is considering various measures to improve disclosure . But without waiting for regulatory prodding , the funds themselves should clearly explain to shareholders how they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rates rise . IS MY FUND MANAGER PUTTING HIS INTERESTS ABOVE MINE ? * An unethical manager could hurt a fund in several ways . He could buy securities for his own account and then drive up their price by having the fund make huge purchases of the same stock  --  a practice known as front-running . In addition , a manager could accept profit-insuring deals on initial public offerings and feel obliged to have the fund buy other stocks from the same firm  --  regardless of whether they are good investments . Or a manager could use the fund 's money to buy shares in which friends , associates or relatives have some financial stake . These issues surfaced in January , when the Denver-based Invesco Fund group fired star manager John Kaweske for failing to report stock trades in his personal account . An Invesco spokesman who insists fund shareholders suffered no losses as a result of Kaweske 's personal trading , goes on to concede that the SEC is examining the transactions . After the firing , press reports also raised questions about some of the investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times said , for example , that Kaweske 's son , John D. Kaweske , benefited financially when Kaweske had two of his funds buy 1.6 million shares in Crown Laboratories . The younger Kaweske told MONEY that his father invested in Crown in July 1993 after he introduced his father to financial adviser John Antretter , who was helping Crown raise money . The following month , Kaweske 's son went into business with Antretter . The younger Kaweske says he himself now owns 100,000 shares of Crown that he acquired after his father made the investment . He says there was nothing improper about the transactions . The elder Kaweske did not return calls seeking comment . Press reports have also contended that the SEC was considering a probe of Fidelity Investments for possible securities law violations stemming from fund managers ' personal trades . The SEC would not comment on whether it is delving into Fidelity managers ' trading ; Fidelity spokesman Connie Hubbell told MONEY she knows of no such investigation . In the wake of the Kaweske incident , an ICI panel issued a stringent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the recommendations , which the ICI has asked funds to adopt by the end of this year , are a ban on managers ' profiting from short-term transactions ( buying and selling within 60 days ) and investing in initial public offerings . Says Ronald Lynch , the Lord Abbett &; Co. investment firm managing partner who led the ICI advisory panel : " These strict rules show we 're serious about making sure not a single shareholder suffers a penny of economic harm . " What you can do . Ask your fund whether it plans to adopt the tough new ICI code of ethics on personal trading ; if not , urge it to do so  --  consider voting with your feet . What the industry should do . The ICI should continue to press all fund companies to take the pledge . Fund companies should have fund managers report the returns on their personal holdings each year . Or as SEC chairman Levitt would do if he ran a fund , simply bar managers from any personal trading . HOW MUCH DOES MY FUND REALLY COST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds . Look up the fund 's expense ratio in the prospectus or a mutual fund rating guide such as Morningstar 's or Value Line 's . Bingo , you 're done : If the expense ratio is 1.25% , that means for every hundred dollars you have in the fund , you are paying $1.25 each year to cover the investment adviser 's fee as well as marketing , advertising , custodial and administrative services  --  and not a penny more . But for investors who buy funds sold only through brokers or financial planners , trying to answer this simple question can become a calculator-punching session that could give an actually Excedrin headache No. 31 . Here 's why : Seeking to make their sales commissions more palatable ( translation : to disguise them ) , nearly 800 funds now offer two or three classes of shares ( labeled A , B and C ) with differing sales charges and annual expenses . Each share class gives you an interest in the same portfolio , but since the fee structures differ , no two classes have precisely the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms , such as Paine Webber , have gone as far as D shares , and shades of Dr. Seuss ' Cat in the Hat , the ICI recently proposed yet two more variations : Y and Z shares , to be used for institutional investors and fund company employees , respectively . But many fund experts contend such confusion could alienate consumers . Warns James Stack , editor of the monthly InvesTech Mutual Funds newsletter : " At some point small investors may just throw up their hands and say , ' Maybe that CD is n't too bad after all . ' " Moreover , by making comparison shopping more difficult , multiple-share classes stifle competitive pressures that might push costs down . An exclusive study of expense ratios from 1983 to 1993 , performed by Morningstar for MONEY , shows that while the assets in diversified domestic equity funds ballooned from $61.3 billion to $491.5 billion , the asset-weighted expense ratios of those funds increased to 0.96% from 0.75% . Among taxable bond funds , the asset-weighted expense ratio rose from 0.73% in 1983 to 0.82% in 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . ( Expenses have declined a bit in this category from a high of 0.93 in 1988 and 1989 , however . ) Expense ratios in tax-free bond funds , by contrast , have largely remained stable over the past 10 years , vacillating between 0.65% and 0.72 , while assets have skyrocketed from $14.7 billion in 1983 to $255.7 billion in 1993 . Oppenheimer management chairman Jon Fossel points out that fund investors demand and get many more services than they used to . " Comparing today 's mutual fund to one of 10 years ago is like looking at a basic Model T next to a Ford Taurus with air conditioning and power steering , " he says . Fossel notes that features like free exchanges from one fund to another , checking privileges and 24-hour access to fund prices have increased the fund company expenses . But low-fee zealot and Vanguard chairman John Bogle says that argument does n't wash : " Vanguard has added all those services , and our expenses are considerably lower than they were 10 years ago . " What you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . If your fund 's expenses are above average , write to independent directors asking them to bring them in line with peers . What the industry should do . Look for ways to streamline fees . One modest proposal from Kathryn McGrath : Roll all charges , including sales commissions , investment advisory fees , distribution costs and transfer fees , into one annual charge so that investors can better compare costs . WHO IS REALLY MANAGING MY MIND ? * Since July 1993 , the SEC has required all mutual funds to disclose the names of portfolio managers in their prospectuses and to inform shareholders whenever a manager departs . Score one for fund investors , right ? Not exactly . In an irritating twist , it 's getting more difficult to find out who 's at the helm of many funds . Why ? Sponsors are still taking advantage of a regulation loophole that allows them to list multiple managers or to simply claim the fund is run by a management team and give no names at all . According to Morningstar , nearly 35% of funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up from 15% in 1989 . Of course , some funds , such as those in the Twentieth Century group , really are run by an investment committee . What 's more , industry officials say it 's overly simplistic to boil down the investment management process to one name . Says ICI chairman Lynch : " Most often a consumer is buying a fund company 's style , its approach to markets and risk  --  not the services of one person . " But critics contend the " yea , team " approach is often little more than an attempt to avoid revealing who is really calling the shots . Now why would a fund company want to do that ? Simple  --  to discourage investors from fleeing when a successful manager departs . Says Morningstar editor Rekenthaler : " Funds are constantly fibbing or at least massaging the reporting when it comes to who 's running the fund . " What you can do . If your fund claims team management , ask for details such as which manager has the final say over decisions and how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't divulge this information , seek it from mutual fund rating companies . ( As long as the performance is sound , it does n't make sense to pull out of the fund over this issue alone . ) What the industry should do . Stop hiding behind the team management shield in cases where a lead manager makes the ultimate investing decisions ; in cases of true team management , disclose more information , such as the specific duties of each manager and what portion of the portfolio each oversees . ARE THE FUND PRICES I SEE IN THE NEWSPAPER ACCURATE ? * Until recently , you might have scoffed at this question . But in June a manager at $274 billion Fidelity Investments knowingly sent out day-old prices on 150 funds after a computer snafu delayed the tabulation of net asset values . Well , go ahead and scoff anyway . According to Kevin Farragher , the ICI 's director of operations for distribution , " The net asset values that appear in the newspaper are like Ivory soap  --  they 're 99 and 44/100% accurate . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no more than 40 of the 3,800 quotes that appear in the newspaper each day are wrong , giving funds an accuracy rate of 98.95% . In most cases , the prices are off by a penny or two a share , usually because the fund has inadvertently mispriced one or more securities in the mad rush to meet the deadline for sending fund prices to the National Association of Securities Dealers , which distributes them to news services . But even the current small margin of error overstates the problem . That 's because most of the faulty NAVs printed in newspapers are corrected before the fund actually processes shareholder transactions . In the Fidelity incident , for example , all trades were made using accurate prices , not the erroneous numbers in print . On rare occasions , though , mistakes do creep through , and shareholders buy or redeem at the wrong price . For example , Fidelity told MONEY that of the 15,254 NAVs that the fund giant calculated between January and May of this year , 24 ( 16/100 of 1% ) had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fidelity caught the error during its normal procedure of validating the previous day 's NAVs . And though not required to by law , the company made either the fund or the shareholders whole in each instance . But there is a more troubling pricing problem  --  namely , the question of whether a fund is assigning the proper market value to its securities . This is mainly a concern for bond funds that hold difficult-to-price securities such as municipal bonds , junk bonds or  --  here they come again  --  yield-boosting derivatives . For muni bond funds , the problem is that of the 1.5 million or so issues outstanding , maybe 180 or so trade on any given day and can be priced on the basis of actual sales . That means the majority of munis are priced by matrix  --  essentially a mathematical formula that takes into account factors like the bond 's coupon rate , maturity , credit rating and call features . And those that do n't quite fit into a pricing formula are priced by hand  --  that is , the fund or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or estimates of the value of the bonds . Regardless of which method is used , says Geoff Bobroff , a fund consultant in East Greenwich , R.L , " none of these prices tell you what you would get if those bonds were sold . " Similar difficulties complicate the pricing of junk bonds . As a practical matter , even if a fund 's NAV is slightly inflated compared with the value of the securities it holds , such a variance is most likely to surface during times of market turmoil  --  and even then probably only if massive redemptions force the fund to unload its most difficult-to-price holdings . While rare , sell-offs of fund shares large enough to expose shareholders to underlying pricing problems do occur . When assets in the Paine Webber short-term income fund , for example , plummeted 57% , or some $970 million , in the first half of this year , the fund 's derivative holdings zoomed to 24% of the portfolio ( as noted above ) , prompting Paine Webber to protect shareholders by buying the derivatives from the fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securities on its books What you can do . Pricing uncertainties are just one more reason to avoid funds that use risky derivatives . But if you want the tax-free income of muni funds , or the double-digit payouts junk bonds , you will just have to accept the fact that the issuer prices are more like appraisals than precise reflections of the most recent sale . To lower the chances of being stung by a fund with overpriced muni or junk holdings , stick to national muni funds such as SteinRoe Managed Municipals ( 800-338-2550 ) , with a 0.9% gain for the year to Aug. 1 , and Tax-Exempt Bond Fund of America ( 4.75% load ; 800-421-4120 ) , up 1.7% , which tend to have the most liquid portfolios , and junk funds such a Vanguard Fixed-Income High-Yield Corporate ( 800-851-4999 ) , up 1.9% , and Invesco High Yield ( 800-525-8085 ) , up 0.5% , which invest in higher-quality , more accurately priced junk . What the industry should do . Provide detailed information to shareholders about pricing of fund holdings , especially infrequently traded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of securities compared with the price at which they were valued by the fund the day before they were sold . WHO IS LOOKING OUT FOR MY INTERESTS ? * Fund investors have two principal advocates : the independent directors on the fund 's board and government regulators , the most prominent of which is the SEC . Independent directors , so named because they do not work for the fund company , usually meet quarterly with the fund management to weigh on a number of issues , ranging from the size of the fund 's expense ratio to the kinds of securities the fund buys . They also get together annually to review the fund 's investment advisory contract . At least 40% of each board 's directors must be independent  --  51% if the fund levies a so-called 12b-1 marketing fee . By law , the independents are there to champion the shareholders ' rights , not to rubber-stamp the sponsor 's requests . Despite the law , however , independent directors too often go along with management on fee increases and other issues . Although the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state attorneys general hold some sway over funds , the SEC , which has the power to censure and fine funds that run afoul of securities laws , is the most visible and forceful watchdog for shareholders . Still , the SEC claims it needs more money to police the industry . Says top fund cop Barbash : " We 'd like to be able to do more inspections , but we need more resources . " One point of contention between the SEC and Congress : In 1993 , fund paid more than $91 million in registration and other fees to the SEC , while Congress gave the agency only $23.4 million to regulate the industry . To beef up the regulatory budget and make the SEC less dependent on annual congressional appropriations , Rep. Edward Markey ( D-Mass. ) , chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance subcommittee , is pushing for self-funding  --  that is , allowing the SEC to use the fees it collects to pay for its own operations . " If we do n't have inspectors and examiners in the field to enforce the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Markey . Reinforcements are on the way . The commission expects to hire another 100 or so fund examiners over the next two years , bringing the total number of inspectors to 300 . Even with these new recruits , Barbash 's division will continue to inspect the 50 largest fund companies once every two years , as it does now . For the rest of the funds , however , inspections will increase to once every 3-1/2 years , vs. four to five years now . What you can do . Press Congress to make the SEC self-funding . And you can write to independent directors or buttonhole them at the fund 's annual meeting to demand that they be more vigilant . What the industry should do . Consider having each fund sponsor take enough money from the advertising and marketing budget to hire an ombudsman who would look out for shareholders ' interests . Funds should also look into launching a self-regulatory organization like the NASD that would supplement the SEC 's enforcement effort . Along with the specific steps we 've discussed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year 's lapses and miscues . Clearly , they should be reassured by the quick responses to recent problems by regulators and the fund companies themselves . If nothing else , this prompt reaction confirms that the funds-as well as the people who police them-largely remain worthy of your loyalty . Still , the fissures that appeared in the industry 's rock-solid reputation impart a more enduring message : When you 're investing in funds , or anything else , you must always temper your trust with an abiding sense of wariness and a healthy dose of skepticism . <p>
