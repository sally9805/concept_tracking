1 ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER A Madrid nurse ( Cecilia Roth ) , luxuriating in grief , goes to Barcelona , where she learns to live again by tending to creatures even more wounded than she . Pedro Almodovar 's screwball melodrama has all the kooky verve of his early comedies , but with a depth and life-enhancing warmth that proves Spain 's bad boy has reached a vibrant maturity . If this movie does n't touch your heart , consult a cardiologist . You may be missing something . <P> 2 THE MATRIX With its dazzling effects and the dizzying ways it toys with reality , virtual and actual , this film may or may not portend cinema 's future . But who cares about that when what we have from Larry and Andy Wachowski is a demonically hip , computer-driven reimagining of the dorked-out sci-fi tradition ? <P> 3 TARZAN and SOUTH PARK : BIGGER LONGER &; UNCUT It can be plausibly argued that there were more good cartoon features made in the U.S. this year than there were live-action films . Disney alone had Tarzan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King ) , Fantasia 2000 ( a rhapsody of sound and light ) and , via Pixar , the deft , ingratiating Toy Story 2 . And what can we say about Trey Parker 's very un-Disney South Park that the film itself did n't sing in four-letter words and the cleverest original movie score in decades ? Just that it 's devilishly , hummably funny . <P> 4 THE END OF THE AFFAIR This may be Graham Greene 's best novel ; surely Neil Jordan 's starkly disciplined film is the best screen adaptation of any of Greene 's fictions . An account of a slightly slutty woman 's unlikely transformation into something like sainthood , it is acted with stunning austerity by Julianne Moore and Ralph Fiennes . <P> 5 ROSETTA She is the teenager who will do anything to get any job , however menial . Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne 's dour Belgian drama earned the top prize at Cannes this year by being both grinding in its bleakness and inspiring in its intensity . Emilie Dequenne plays Rosetta with a blank fury that suggests a medieval saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of the shots at suburbia are cheap . Yes , Kevin Spacey undergoes an all too familiar mid-life crisis . But Sam Mendes directs with vivifying freshness , and Spacey 's wicked performance as the cynical , bedeviled protagonist is hands down the year 's best . <P> 7 THE DREAM LIFE OF ANGELS If poor Rosetta had found a pal at one of her crummy jobs , the resulting film might have been this spare , coiled first feature from France 's Erick Zonca . Marie ( Natacha Regnier ) is broody , draped in doom ; Isa ( Elodie Bouchez ) is a sunny vagabond . Their friendship and rivalry are beautifully observed , magnificently portrayed . <P> 8 ELECTION Cold , driven , hilarious Reese Witherspoon cares far too much about a school election . Matthew Broderick , the teacher supervising it , goes into sexual overdrive as he tries to cope with her machinations . And director Alexander Payne makes a dark , smart , sexy farce about the American ways of winning , losing and screwing up . <P> 9 THE TALENTED MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fake somebody than a real nobody . " So he pursues a fatal game of pretense in Anthony Minghella 's devious twist on the Patricia Highsmith crime novel about patrician indolence and underclass yearning . In a handsome cast , no one can touch Jude Law for golden gorgeousness with an undercoat of sadism .
