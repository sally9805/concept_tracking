<p> ILLUSTRATION : <p> ANN WILMOT GAUTHIER DISCOVERED THAT DRAMATIC PERSONAL EVENTS INSPIRED HER TO PAINT , AND THAT THE ACT OF CREATING PAINTINGS COULD INSTILL A SENSE OF PURPOSE AND ORDER IN HER LIFE WHEN THERE WAS NONE . <p> Ann Wilmot Gauthier might have stepped out of a Tennessee Williams play : Her life and work are filled with the pain tragedy , and hope that often captured the playwright 's imagination . Hers is the story of an artist whose family had settled in a fashionable part of old New Orleans just off the St. Charles Avenue streetcar line , a part of town where family background and appearances matter more than wealth . To most uptown New Orleanians , the sounds of the streetcar 's steel wheels and clanging bells  --  which became a potent symbol in Williams 's A Streetcar Named Desire  --  are never far away . They are a part of the people 's psyche , and they are very much part of Ann Gauthier 's childhood recollections , of good times as well as bad . <p> Like many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with the drama of a troubled family , financial difficulties , a failed marriage , a bout with alcoholism , and depression . However , her tale is also one of recovery , hope , and art . Gauthier , who is fifty-three , currently lives comfortably in a small place in the thickly wooded area around Lake Pontchartrain across from New Orleans , just east of Covington  --  a place Southern writer Walker Percy once called a " nonplace . " Although her life story is difficult , it is one she has a driving need to tell , especially to other artists . <p> " I 'm a really intense person , " Gauthier confides to me during my visit to her studio in the woods . ' It 's tough for me to deal with that intensity , so I 've managed to build up a protective facade . But when I paint , I 'm greatly relieved  --  not because of what I paint , but because of what I 'm getting in touch with , however vague . <p> " Part of my need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feelings , " she adds . " All kinds of things are going on unconsciously while I 'm painting , as if a tape has been turned on . I might be having angry thoughts when I 'm painting , but , oddly enough , I 'll wind up doing a beautiful painting . I 'm always a bit surprised when people tell me they can learn a lot about me from looking at my work . " <p> Gauthier says that an abiding guilt has controlled her life since she was a child . When she was only six years old , her younger sister , then four , died a terrible death from rabies . She watched her little sister slowly and painfully fight the inevitable . " I knew she was going to die and I was going to live , " she recalls . " I felt a lot of guilt . I was the survivor . " Being in the arts , she says , may have been a form of atonement for the fact that she survived and her sister did n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've felt that way most of my life . Not realizing what was oppressing me , I carried that burden for many years . " <p> Another destructive force in her life was anger . " Anger has always motivated me , " she continues . " While young , I was taught that anger was bad and , because I expressed it , that I was a bad person . That 's where all the guilt came from . People said to me , ' Look how angry you are  --  you 're a bad person , ' and I believed them . No one ever asked me what I was angry about The biggest awakening of my adult life was to find out that I was a nice person . " <p> During her teenage years , Gauthier 's family lived comfortably in a big home just off St. Charles Avenue , near Loyola University . Students were always coming and going , and the Jesuit priests from Loyola visited in her home regularly . She played the piano and explored her artistic talent , which she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to a friend 's house and saw a small watercolor of one of the children hanging on the wall , " she recalls . " I was in awe . I thought to myself , ' I want to do that more than anything else in the world . ' At first , the only thing I was interested in was drawing people ; I found that I had a knack for it . I was fascinated by people . When I met them , I would study their faces so I could draw them later without looking . " <p> After high school , in the mid-1950s , Gauthier attended the John McCrady Art School in New Orleans for seven months . While there , she met fellow New Orleanian Rolland Golden , now a prominent Southern artist . " Rolland was more of an inspiration to me than anyone else , " she says . " What he was doing absolutely blew me away : the slanted telephone poles , the shacks , the bright colors and green grass . It all made a very strong impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golden and his wife , Stella , over the years . <p> When , through a reversal of fortune , Gauthier 's family could no longer afford to pay her tuition , the art school offered her a scholarship , but she decided to go to work . After a string of jobs as a commercial artist , her family , which was typical of most families at that time , thought it was time she found a husband . " The biggest problem I had in 1958 concerned deciding whom to marry , " she laughs . " I needed someone to take care of me ; that 's what women felt they needed in that era . " <p> In 1959 , Gauthier met that someone and they eloped . In the early years , the marriage went well . She became a housewife and mother . Three children came along . " I loved having children , " she states . " For the first time in my life , I felt a tremendous sense of responsibility . It was a mind-blowing experience . " Gauthier continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic voice . But her marriage started to deteriorate , and she began to drink and fight bouts of deep depression . <p> " I desperately needed to paint  --  to express myself , " she states with emotion . " I knew I had to do something for myself , anything to turn my mind on . But at that point , I felt lost with my art ; so , usually at five o'clock , I 'd start drinking  --  just enough , I told myself , to kill the pain . As long as I remained conscious , I felt I was still being responsible . " <p> In 1970 , Gauthier , now living in southwest Louisiana with her husband , began finding her voice as a painter . " I was seeing lots of old , broken-down shacks in intense lights and shadows , " she says , " and my mind focused in on what I was seeing . Rolland Golden 's work triggered something in the back of my mind : all the drama of light and dark shacks . " She happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to use acrylics as watercolors . " After that , " she says , " I started producing three paintings a day . My approach is exactly like traditional watercolor . You can put one wash on top of another without destroying either . Acrylics dry pretty fast , however , so you 've got to be sure of what you 're doing . " As fast as she turned out the paintings , Gauthier shipped them to her sister-in-law 's small gallery in Baton Rouge . " I was pretty excited about my work , " she says , " but I was still drinking . " <p> Gauthier and her husband finally divorced in 1974 . " I went into a deep , deep depression , and hit bottom with a bout of alcoholism , " she comments . But she was able to stop drinking the following year and tried to make a living with her art . " What saved my life was my efforts at painting , " she states . During this time , she continued to paint pictures of ramshackle sharecropper cabins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like taking something sad and making it happy . It was as if I was trying to redo my own childhood . " She continued that theme until the early 1980s . Slowly , she began to explore painting still lifes and compositions depicting street scenes reflected in shop windows of New Orleans ' French Quarter . At first glance , these scenes seem sentimental , although , they were not chosen as nostalgic tributes to another era but simply as elements in an ongoing interplay between objects and light . For example , a painting Gauthier did of a French , Quarter antique shop focused on the shop 's window  --  on how the surrealistic shapes of the reflected street scene related to the contours of the antiques arranged behind the glass . <p> " When I got sober , the entire world opened up , " she says . " I became happy , joyous , and free . It was wonderful . I was very angry over what had happened in my marriage , but I was very happy to be striving with my art . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope with her new life , other family difficulties arose . " The problems of that period absolutely threw me to the ground , " she remembers . " They just crushed me . " Three years of therapy followed . " I found out things about myself that had been severely repressed , " she adds . " A valve that had been clogged up inside me blew wide open . " It was during this time that Gauthier 's still-life paintings took on a personal meaning . Most of them were interiors , often showing a window looking out at the world . Bright sunlight would cut through dark , somber shadows and backgrounds and play against bowls of fruit or other objects , creating contrasts of light and shadow . <p> During this time , Gauthier began maturing as a painter , mastering her technique and her use of color . She says her work became far more controlled and logical . " Some people like the earlier work because it is so emotional , " she muses . " But I was actually falling apart emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm in control of my life . I have a whole new path . " Gauthier credits her new stability to a twelve-step inspirational program called " A Course in Miracles " and to her subsequent spiritual I awakening . " The program is I a tight , logical system that I starts with a premise about ' forgiveness and inner peace . It 's about healing relationships , " she explains . <p> Although Gauthier is exploring new themes in her works , she is continuing to do still lifes . In fact , looking at her unusually lit still-life paintings is reminiscent of Tom Wingfield 's last lines in Tennessee Williams 's The Glass Menagerie : " The window is filled with pieces of colored glass , tiny transparent bottles in delicate colors , like bits of a shattered rainbow . " " I 'm beginning to elaborate on the abstractness of still lifes , " comments the artist . " Suddenly , I 'll see abstract patterns falling across a table and hitting objects in a certain way . For instance , on a rainy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not notice anything special , but all of a sudden light will hit something in a certain way and I 'll get excited . " <p> Gauthier says she is still in transition , still searching for new directions . " Now that I am at peace , I do n't want to paint dark still lifes , " she says . " In a way , I do n't really know how to deal with such peace , and I wonder if I 'm where I should be with my art . " Over the last year , Gauthier 's paintings have become more cheerful . Bright and colorful garden scenes have taken the place of somber shadows . " I 'm in the middle of change , " she adds , " and I do n't know what direction I 'm going to go in . I have n't envisioned it yet . There 's something going on inside of me that I need to paint , but I do n't know what it is yet . <p> " In the past , " she continues , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation in my head about old resentments and anger . I 'd be thinking about all kinds of hateful things and I 'd look at my finished painting  --  it would be beautiful to me . I 'd think , ' How did that happen ? ' All this ugliness is going on inside my mind and I 'm painting a picture . But that 's not happening anymore . I 'm thinking more about the loving , about the healing . " <p> The main problem Gauthier now faces is the one faced by most other artists  --  discipline . " I make myself work on a regular basis because it feels so good afterward , " she says . " My emotional state is directly related to what 's going on in my studio . If I 'm not comfortable with what I 'm painting or if I 'm not painting as frequently as I should , I do n't feel good about myself . But these days , my normal state is happiness . " <p> Does Gauthier have a message for other women artists ? Definitely ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I can make a living painting . But I feel guilty that the only way I can justify painting is to say , ' I have to do it for a living . ' I want to say to all women artists that it 's okay to paint just because you want to . So often women are raised to put other people 's needs before their own , and to feel guilty if they do something just because they want to do it . " <p> Gauthier is now doing exactly what she wants : painting . And her work is receiving regional and national attention . Her friend Rolland Golden , who also lives near Covington , calls her " creative , a fine technician . I think she 's one of Louisiana 's best artists . " He says her still lifes remind him of the work by the Dutch Master Jan Vermeer , " but with a contemporary point of view . She has simplified things to where the abstract shows through . " <p> She has been included in numerous juried shows . among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Painters in Casein and Acrylic and six produced by the Louisiana Watercolor Society . In 1989 , her work was accepted by the Rocky Mountain National Watermedia Exhibition and traveling show . In 1988 , one of her paintings hung with those of other prominent Louisiana artists in a group show in New Orleans entitled " Louisiana Realism in the ' 80s . " In October she had a solo show at the International House Club at the World Trade Center in New Orleans , and this past December she had a solo show at the Percy Whiting Art Center in Fairhope , Alabama . <p> " I now have a new path , " she concludes , " and a new way of living that I would n't trade for anything in the world . " She has found peace . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Still Life With Paper , 1989 , acrylic , 22 x 30 . Collection the artist .
