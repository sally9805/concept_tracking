<p> In these excerpts from her new best-selling book , " Talking From 9 to 5 , " Deborah Tannen examines how differences in style affect men and women at work . <p> What to do ? Authority looks like a man <p> A woman had to confront her boss . He assigned special projects in a neighboring district to one of the men on her team , who would announce to her that he could not do what she had asked because he had to complete a project for her boss - a higher authority she could not argue with . <p> She explained to her boss that when he gives assignments directly to someone who reports to her , it makes it difficult for her team to meet its goals . Her boss agreed that she had a point . Satisfied , she said , " So you 'll tell him to check with me before he takes on something for you ? " At this her boss balked : " I ca n't tell him to ask Mommy for permission . " <p> The prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to her boss 's mind the scenario of a child supplicant , because a mother is one of the few images we have of female authority - whereas men in authority are as likely to suggest a military commander or a sports coach or captain as a father . <p> The association of authority with maleness is pervasive . In language femaleness is associated with softeners , mitigation and politeness , whereas maleness is associated with authority . This means that women who want to sound authoritative must risk sounding male . The ways women are expected to talk are at odds with images of authority . Women are expected to hedge their beliefs as opinions , to seek opinions and advice from others , to be " polite . " <p> If a woman talks this way , she is seen as lacking in authority . But if she talks with certainty , makes bold statements of fact rather than hedged statements of opinion , interrupts others , goes on at length , and speaks in a declamatory and aggressive manner , she will be disliked . <p> Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at odds with our expectations for how a woman should behave . If a woman talks in ways expected of women , she is more likely to be liked than respected . If she talks in ways expected of men , she is more likely to be respected than liked . <p> Many of the constraints I have discussed apply equally to women and men . A man who quietly does a good job but is not good at letting others know about the job he is doing may go unrecognized . And there are many men who for reasons of cultural background , upbringing or personality are not comfortable " blowing their own horn , " not good at speaking up at meetings , too succinct and understated to command attention . <p> But their situations are really not the same , because if such men were to take assertiveness training and alter their styles , they would enhance not only their chances for success . Everything they did to enhance their assertiveness at work would also enhance their masculinity , in others ' eyes . <p> But a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhance her assertiveness risks undercutting her femininity , in the eyes of others . And everything she does to fit expectations of how a woman should talk risks undercutting the impression of competence that she makes . <p> As more and more women , each with her own unique style , take positions of authority , we can hope that each woman will be free to be more like herself . <p> You should get credit for the job you do <p> In all the companies I observed , I met women who did not seem to be getting full credit for the jobs they were doing . This can be tricky to describe , especially when women were getting a lot of recognition or had achieved a high level of acceptance . It seemed like bad form for them to complain , and ( perhaps for this reason ) few did . But they were often aware of an imbalance . <p> A woman who headed a major division of her company , and who did work comparable to that of six men who headed the other six divisions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice presidents . Another woman was doing work parallel to the jobs of several other men who reported to a vice president , but on paper she reported to someone who reported to the VP . In a company , your prestige is partly determined by the status of the person to whom you report . <p> In addition to doing excellent work , you must make sure that your work is recognized . Make a point to tell your boss , or your boss 's boss , what you have done - either orally , or by sending reports or copies of pertinent correspondence . <p> The glass ceiling : A wall of words <p> Conversational style differences play a role in installing a glass ceiling . When decisions are made about promotion to management positions , the qualities sought are a high level of competence , decisiveness and ability to lead . If it is men , or mostly men , who are making the decisions about promotions , they are likely to misinterpret women 's ways of talking as showing indecisiveness , inability to assume authority and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is crucial to preserve the appearance of consensus when making decisions because she feels anything else would appear bossy and arrogant begins by asking those around her for their opinions . This can be interpreted as evidence that she does n't know what she thinks should be done , that she is trying to get others to make decisions for her . <p> ' They must know something I do n't know ' <p> We judge others not only by how they speak , but also by how they are spoken to . If people are being spoken to as if they know nothing , we assume they know nothing . If people are addressed as if they are pretty smart , we assume they 're pretty smart . But if women routinely take the position of novice or listener to make others feel smart , it is highly likely that those others , as well as observers , will underestimate their abilities . <p> THE MEETING ' Did n't I just say that ? ' <p> Why should meetings be so frustrating ? A large source of dissatisfaction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sense , meetings are a pressure-cooker microcosm of the workplace . <p> Some of the men I spoke to - and just about every woman - told me of the experience of saying something at a meeting and having it ignored , then hearing the same comment taken up when it is repeated by someone else ( nearly always a man ) . <p> Getting your ideas across <p> Many people ( especially women ) try to avoid seeming presumptuous by prefacing their statements with a disclaimer such as , " I do n't know if this will work , but . . . " <p> Some speakers may also speak at a lower volume , and try to be succinct so as not to take up more time than necessary . Researchers Barbara and Gene Eakins examined tape recordings of seven university faculty meetings and found that , with one exception , the men spoke more often and , without exception , spoke longer . The men 's turns ranged from 10.66 to 17.07 seconds , the women 's from 3 to 10 seconds . The longest contribution by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man . <p> These aspects of how one speaks at a meeting mean that when two people say " the same thing , " they probably say it very differently . They may speak with or without a disclaimer , loudly or softly , in a self- deprecating or declamatory way , briefly or at length , and tentatively or with apparent certainty . <p> When people have different negotiating styles , a seemingly democratic structure may end up functioning on the revised principle of Animal Farm : " All animals are equal , but some are more equal than others . " <p> If a number of individuals agree to pick up and repeat each other 's ideas at meetings , they may be able to increase the impact of all their contributions . <p> Copyright 1994 Deborah Tannen , Ph.D .
