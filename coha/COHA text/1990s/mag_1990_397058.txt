The Under $10 Sure Thing FYI 's innovative onophile presents ten wines that are as pleasing to the palate as they are gentle on the wallet . <p> AT WINE TASTINGS , you hear all kinds of excuses for legendary , labels that turn out to be costly swill : " It was shaken up in the cab coming downtown . " " That aroma of burning rubber will eventually blow off . " " Gravitational pull from the full moon . rising barometric pressure . negative vibes compounded by mass hypnosis . " Still , most veteran wine drinkers will allow that even the biggest names can be expensive disappointments . And even in the great years , the prestigious bottles may be virtually undrinkable for a decade or more . <p> Breathes there a wine that is both ready to drink upon release and dependably good from vintage to vintage ? Among the many thousands of wines I 've sipped , swallowed , or spat out , only a handful deliver the goods year after year . Oddly enough , except for a few rare $30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smith of France , the wines that stand out for their consistent quality can be had for under ten bucks . <p> How can cheaper models be more predictably successful than big-ticket items ? To begin with , they typically come from very warm , dry , climates . True , the cooler growing areas can produce supremely elegant and complex wines when conditions are ideal , but they are also vulnerable to spring frosts , a dearth of sunshine , and harvest rain . Then too , the best-made bargains tend to be blends of grape varieties or fruit from several vineyard sources with distinct microclimates , so their creators have more flexibility than producers working with a single vineyard and only one variety . <p> The following ten wines offer more character and flavor intensity than most bottles at triple the price . Enjoyable from day one , they 're even better after a year or so of additional bottle aging . Best of all , they can be purchased and consumed without your having to consult byzantine vintage charts , weather maps and actuarial tables . ( Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special search of the marketplace ; do n't hesitate to call the importer for assistance in tracking them down . ) REDS <p> Cousio-Macul Antiguas Reservas  --  The finest cabernet sauvignons from Chile 's arid central valley zone are some of the world 's greatest values in dry red wine . Top honors go to the flagship wine from the venerable Cousio-Macul winery . The secret hem is 70-year-old vines , and five years of barrel and bottle aging before the wine is released . The result is a warm , silky , spicy wine that resembles a ten-year-old Bordeaux petit chateau from a ripe vintage . You can savor this New World offering with beef or lamb while Francophiles chip their teeth on brutally tannic  --  and far more expensive  --  young clarets. $7-$9 . ( Imported by Billington Distributors , Springfield , VA . 703-644-6344 . ) <p> Ctes du Rhne ( E. Guigal )  --  Marcel Guigal is best known for his extravagantly rich single-vineyard Cte Rotie , for which frenzied collectors have been known to pay up to $500 a bottle . Happily for us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a blend made entirely from purchased wine . What makes this wine so special ? Guigal enters a grower 's cellar wallet first , so he pretty much gets his pick of the crop . He also uses less of the cherry-and pepper-flavored but essentially blowsy grenache grape , and more syrah and mourvdre , which adds acidity and herbal complexity . The outcome is an uncommonly nuanced wine which will stand up to barbecued meats , mast turkey and cassoulet. $9-$10 . ( Classic Wine Imports , Boston , MA. 617-731-6644 . ) <p> Periquita ( Jos Maria da Fonseca )  --  This proprietary blend , made on Portugal 's temperate Arrbida peninsula southeast of Lisbon , has been around since the 1850s . Its breakthrough occurred in the early 1980s , when a winemaker trained at the University of California at Davis introduced temperature-controlled fermentation to preserve freshness of fruit and minimize volatile acidity ( the sharp , nail polish aroma that formerly plagued so many red wines ) . Today 's kinder , gentler Periquita still offers an earthy , black cherry tang reminiscent of red Burgundy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with roasted game birds . Around $5 . ( Cavalier Selections , Boulder , ( X ) . 303-494-7664 . ) <p> Corbires ( Domaine de Fontsainte )  --  The Corbires district of France 's vast Midi produces a sea of lean , mean vin ordinaire . But the Domaine de Fontsainte , with some of the best vineyard sites for the carignan grape that runs through the region , retains its best wine to make an engaging , fruity red that 's as thirst-quenching as Beaujolais  --  and cheaper and more consistent to boot . Currently a hit on the West Coast served chilled with mesquite burgers and designer sausages . $6-$8 . ( Look for a special bottling called " La Demoiselle , " from the property 's steepest vineyards in the best vintages : this one , too , can be found for under $10 . ) ( Kermit Lynch , Berkeley , CA. 415-524-1524 . ) <p> Ravenswood Vintners Blend Zinfandel  --  This Sonoma County limited production single-vineyard winery is best known for its intense , zinfandels from some of California 's oldest vines . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created the Vintners Blend , a portion of which is wine made from purchased grapes ( with 50% new oak used for aging ) , and the rest from finished wines selected to provide whatever qualities the base wine may be lacking . He 's come up with a flamboyant raspberry-flavored wine that boasts unusual complexity for its price . Ideal with spicy Thai food and Tex-Mex. $5.50-$7.50 . ( Ravenswood Winery , Sonoma , CA. 707-938-1960 . ) <p> Gran Sangre de Toro ( Torres )  --  This renowned , family-owned winery , based in the Penedes region southwest of Barcelona , turns out an array of remarkably good values from traditional Spanish varieties , as well as from international grapes like cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay . The Gran Sangre de Toro is a better version of their regular-Sangre de Toro  --  made with superior batches of wine and more new oak aging . Beginning with the 1986 vintage , a small amount of syrah has been added to the blend of grenache and carignan to give the wine more spine and longevity . This deeply concentrated red has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aged cheeses. $7-$9 . ( Seagram Chateau &; Estate Wines , New York , NY . 212-572-7725 . ) WHITES <p> Mcon Ig Domaine des Roches ( Carpi-Gobet )  --  Wine insiders often look to the less chic Mconnais , and away from the top Cte d'Or vineyards , for Burgundy 's best chardonnay value . The key to the consistent success of this offering from the Domaine des Roches is hand-picking , which permits the elimination of underripe or rotten berries  --  crucial in a region that occasionally suffers a shortfall of sunshine , or a damaging harvest rain . When young , this vibrant , lemony wine is the perfect foil for oysters or mussels ; with a few years of bottle aging , it develops a buttery richness that holds its own with cold seafood alads. $8-$10 . ( Robert Kacher Selections , Washington , DC. 202-832-9083 . ) <p> Pinot d'Alsace Les Lutins ( Josmeyer )  --  Owner Jean Meyer uses the Les Lutins designation for his better casks of the early-maturing pinot auxerrois grape , which ripens beautifully in nearly every vintage . A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including a patch of the great grand cru Hengst vineyard . In very . ripe vintages , aromas and flavors run toward peach and tangerine , while in the cooler years the wine is dominated by a limey , mineral taste from the chalky Hengst soil . Les Lutins marries beautifully with chicken and freshwater fish ; the Alsatians consider the wine congenial enough to be coupled with artichoke ( the dreaded wine-killer ) , asparagus , and other intransigent vegetables . $6-$8 . ( A Christopher Cannan selection . American importers include Pearson 's Wine Importing Co. , Washington , DC. 202-333-6666 . ) <p> Joao Pires " White Palmela Wine "  --  Muscat grapes from Portugal 's Arrbida peninsula have traditionally been used to make the fortified dessert wine Moscatel de Setubal  --  that is , until the innovative Joao Pires firm came up with the idea of bottling a dry , light table wine from muscat in the early ' 80s . This peach- and tangerine-scented beauty has yet to catch on among Portugal 's older generation , whose tastes run to oilier whites , but has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfumed delicacy makes it the perfect aperitif . Here is the one wine on this list that docs not profit from bottle aging  --  drink it during the year following the vintage . $5-$7 . ( World Shippers &; Importers , Philadelphia , PA. 215-732-2018 . ) <p> Rothbury Estate Brokenback Vineyard  --  For most oenophiles , the platonic Australian chardonnay is lush , uncomplicated , and cheap . Alas , steep price hikes in recent years have made the ideal more elusive . This bottling , though , from one of Australia 's oldest chardonnay vineyards located in the nearly subtropical Hunter Valley north of Sydney , delivers a smoky , satisfying mouthful year after year . The Brokenback may well be Rothbury 's best property for chardonnay : this producer 's pricier reserve chardonnay has also come from this site in most recent vintages . Pair with grilled swordfish or creamy chicken dishes . $9-$10 .
