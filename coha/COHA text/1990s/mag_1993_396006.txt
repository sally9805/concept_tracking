Northwest from Beijing , China 's teeming plain is left behind , the soft farm greens giving way to darker forest greens of sharp small mountains where the Great Wall winds like a serpent across ridges . Soon the mountains descend to the drier , less domesticated landscapes of Inner Mongolia , which subside in turn into the harsh grays and yellows of the Gobi Desert . Within the first hour of the flight from the ancient Chinese capital , one is well into the Central Asian wastes of southeastern Mongolia . Gradually , the desert is displaced by semi-desert plains , then grassy steppe , crossed here and there by veins of darker green where seasonal streams make their way over the plateaus . Here and there as the plane descends , grazing animals tended by lone riders cross the landscape  --  horses , cattle , sheep and goats , a camel ; and loose clusters of herdsmen 's round felt tents or yurts , called gers , crop up , as white as mushrooms . The herds and riders , and gers , too , drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mongolia 's capital , Ulan Bator , which lies on the Tuul River in the north of the great steppe , more than 4,000 feet above sea level . Mongolia 's culture , originally a wandering shamanistic one in the thrall of local deities and the sky god Tengri , has been mainly Buddhist since the late sixteenth century , when the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism ( the sect headed by the Dalai Lama ) became the state religion . Even then , the society remained nomadic , independent , with a warrior spirit . Quite possibly , Buddhist influences softened this spirit , for the Mongol herdsmen were eventually absorbed by the Chinese empire . Not until the last emperor was retired , in 1911 , did northern , or " Outer , " Mongolia reclaim its independence . This meant , in effect , turning to Russia for protection , and in 1921 , the new Union of Soviet Socialist Republics used the founding of a " Mongolian People 's Party " as a pretext to invade the country and set up a satellite Communist government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S.S.R. In 1989 , with the departure of most of the Soviet soldiers , came official restoration of both Buddhism and Genghis Khan as " the priceless cultural heritage of the Mongolian people , " and in September 1991 the Dalai Lama arrived on the wings of a religious yearning so pent up by decades of oppression that tens of thousands came to welcome him , arriving by bus and truck and horseback , raising spiritual dust all over Mongolia . Most Mongolians are still nomadic , and the half million people in Ulan Bator  --  almost half of them camped behind wood fences , in gers that can be taken down and moved back out onto the steppe in about an hour  --  represent a quarter of the entire population of a vast country the size of Western Europe . Thus much of Mongolia remains all but empty , not only the deserts to the south but the remote marshes in the far northeast , where endless horizons of Daurian Steppe stretch away over the frontiers with Inner Mongolia and Siberia . With the collapse of the Cold War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West for the first time in many years . Among these visitors have been ornithologists from all over the world who are , rightly , concerned about the cranes of Asia . The crane family first appeared on the fossil record some 60 million years ago , in the time of dinosaurs , and modern cranes have flown the earth for perhaps 9 million years  --  the oldest ( and tallest ) flying birds still in existence . Among the fifteen crane species , nine are breeding birds of Asia , and of these nine , at least five are already considered rare and appear on most official lists as " threatened " or " endangered , " due largely to degradation and destruction of their wetland habitat . ( They are also diminished due to hunting by various predators , man in particular , and to the disruption of both breeding and winter territories by man 's ever-proliferating activities , such as war . ) These five uncommon cranes include the extraordinarily beautiful white-naped crane , Grus vipio , which migrates south from its known breeding range in the Amur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter sites in southeast China , Korea , and Kyushu , the great southern island of Japan . Before any species can be systematically protected , its breeding grounds and migration routes must be well monitored , and the white-naped crane presented a special problem , since it has long appeared on its winter grounds in markedly greater numbers ( its roughly estimated total population is about 4,500 ) than its known breeding grounds could possibly account for . Because in the Cold War decades the isolated Asian ornithologists had little opportunity for fieldwork , or travel to other countries , or even good communication with colleagues in the West , the list of known ranges of the far-flung cranes remained woefully incomplete . Then , in 1991 , with the Soviets gone from Mongolia , the International Crane Foundation ( ICF ) in Baraboo , Wisconsin , received an exciting report from two Mongolian ornithologists that Grus vipio was breeding in remote regions of the Daurian Steppe and that others had been sighted along the wild Kerulen River to the south , near the Chinese border , although no Kerulen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River was the first destination of the ICF 's international expedition to Mongolia , organized to verify and explore any new breeding grounds of the white-naped , or Daurian , crane . It was this expedition that had brought me to Mongolia . On the afternoon of July 21 , James Harris , deputy director of the ICF , Tsuyoshi Fujita , a young Japanese ornithologist of the Wild Bird Society of Japan , and I were met at the Ulan Bator airport by the organizer of the expedition , the Mongolian mammalogist S. Chuluunbataar , a man of sad demeanor and soft dejected voice that hide a sudden delighted smile and a sense of humor . Chuka , as he is called by friends , was accompanied by the two ornithologists  --  Drs . Ayurzaryn Bold and Natsagdorjin Tseveenmyadag  --  who had first reported to the ICF that Grus vipio was a breeding bird in northeastern Mongolia . Chuka speaks English , and " Go " Fujita has some English , too , and Go and the Mongolians share some scraps of Russian . After years of enforced sociability in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris has perfected a hearty missionary manner that counts on an unflagging smile and voluminous laugh . But the good nature and enthusiasm are sincere , and behind them lie sound ornithological knowledge . So there was to be communication of a kind . Otherwise , we were to get by on goodwill , Latin nomenclature , and an intense shared passion for wild cranes  --  which could have served as a metaphor for all that is wild and beautiful and waning in the realm of nature . Mongolia in summer is notorious for hard and sudden changes in the weather , and late that first afternoon we left Ulan Bator in a storm of rain and hail that brought mud rivers in flash floods through the streets , stranding cars and stalling buses and causing the goats to press against the walls , yet in no way fazing the pedestrians , who scarcely quickened their pace in search of shelter from this cold deluge . We traveled in two four-wheel-drive vehicles with spirited and obliging drivers , Dorj and Dawadav , who assisted with the cooking and the camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a stove , food , tools , and the like . Originally , the expedition was scheduled to fly east from Ulan Bator to the town of Choybalsan , near the border with China , then travel overland down the Kerulen , but due to fuel shortages , all domestic flights had been canceled until further notice . A four-day drive was made instead on what one reference book refers to as " the east-west highway , " which turns to mud and ruts a few miles east of Ulan Bator . " We hope you will be tough enough to make this journey , " said the taciturn Dr. Bold , who , at fifty-six , is Mongolia 's pre-eminent ornithologist , a rough old badger in dark glasses and brown business suit that he continued to wear ( without the tie ) on our safari . His thirty-seven-year-old associate , Dr. Tseveenmyadag , called Tseveen , is just as competent and hardy , as he would demonstrate unobtrusively throughout the journey . Perhaps because he is shy and quiet , the retiring Tseveen wore a camouflage suit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold feature of the grassland landscape . An hour from the capital the dirt track climbed a high valley to the continental divide . At the pass , a large cairn , or obo , stood adorned with rags , liquor bottles , rusted cans , broken thermoses , and other miscellaneous offerings , including two pairs of old crutches . There were also a few tattered Buddhist prayer flags . Though traditional mountain cairns set up by wayfarers to placate intemperate deities predated Buddhism , this one appeared to be a debased form of the Buddhist stupas or chortens found on passes throughout the Himalayas . Asked if this disreputable obo represented the disdain for Buddhist ways beaten into the Mongolians by their Russian mentors during the past half century , Chuka said no , and Bold agreed . It was only more evidence , they said sadly , of very low morale among the people . Long after dark , we pitched our tents in a small grassy basin . Here on the steppe , the July night was cold . Scorpio and Cygnus bristled with light , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , the first Mongolian lark I ever saw awaited me on a grass tuft just before the tent . I found puffballs and some mushrooms that Dorj cooked up for breakfast . Nearby steppe marmots stood upright at their burrows like huge prairie dogs , and along the track a sick one lay , gold and ivory fur rising and falling with its breath in the morning sun . A steppe fox whisked through the grass , and a little farther on , a steppe eagle swooped on a young marmot . Unwilling to relinquish it , the eagle glared at us as it tore free red shining shreds of meat . Neatly , then , it eviscerated the creature , leaving the heavy guts behind as it dragged the rest away over the grass . In the high tablelands farther east , a pair of elegant gray birds traversed a barley field , hurrying one chick . These were the demoiselle cranes that I first saw many years ago on winter range in the Sudan . Unlike cranes of the genus Grus , such as the white-naped , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carmine skin that makes those larger birds so striking , but the very simplicity of its markings  --  silver gray and black  --  set off by a silken bib of black plumes at the breast , make it one of the most beautiful of its family . ( The demoiselle received that name from Queen Marie Antoinette , who admired the delicacy of her captive specimens . ) At a signal from the parents , the demoiselle chick pressed itself flat in the thin barley . The adults moved away , affecting to feed , then took off with a ratcheting horn-note call . Almost at once they circled back , alighting at a little distance , " craning " in distress in our direction . For we had found the flattened chick , like a gray pullet with elongated legs and enormous feet . Go banded the chick  --  the first crane that we banded on the expedition  --  and it ran off wearing a green leg band , Y-01 . In wildflower prairie , the track followed a small stream , arriving eventually at a lake and mineral spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though nights were cold , broad day was hot , and in the spring a few families of nomad herdsmen were smearing their bodies with medicinal mud under the patient gaze of waiting horses . Already the plateaus were subsiding into the high rolling plain of the open steppe , islanded by white dots of solitary gers with their dark strings of horses . Soon the stream crossed broad wet meadows of river floodland . Here the Kerulen River , not deep but cold and very swift with the quick loss of altitude , made a great bend toward the east . All afternoon the demoiselles increased in number ; in one flock we counted sixty or more , and captured and banded a pair of chicks , as six Tatar boys came galloping up to watch the operation . Some were riding bareback in their well-soiled cloaks and dusty boots , their skin sun-blackened and hair uncropped . Fighting back their own awe and astonishment , they watched Go closely as he opened his shamanic kit of new and glittering equipment , drew a white muslin bag over one bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it still , fit and glued broad green plastic rings to an upper leg , then measured and weighed the bird while the glue dried . With unrelenting precision Go inscribed the last detail of his data in his book before cutting the tape , removing the bag and jacket , and releasing the chick to run away over the plain . Asked by Chuka if they caught young cranes , and if they ate them , the boys said proudly , Yes , we do ! , but perhaps this was bravado . Any chicks would be easily caught by boys on horseback , yet the demoiselles seemed quite unwary , drawing near man 's habitations and his herds with a confidence suggesting that they were rarely hunted . We camped that night on the riverbank , to the calls of cranes and Eurasian cuckoos , redshanks and an owl , replaced at dawn by the alarmed bark of marmots and the skylark 's day-break song . The day began with fitful rain and cold . Since this was the season of monsoon  --  Mongolia gets almost all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather dreaded it . Already the red ruts of the east-west highway were so rough that earlier travelers  --  mostly trucks , to judge from the very few vehicles we saw  --  had forged their own new tracks to avoid the holes , and in places , as many as ten or a dozen routes fanned out , mile after mile , before braiding once again where the highway forded a stream or crossed a hillside . This is a landscape of great saker falcons  --  two adults flying , then two juveniles on marmot mounds , then a single bird , another , and another , all within the space of a few miles . The big sandy bird has the heavy flight of a gyrfalcon  --  the redoubtable peregrine would appear " light " by comparison . In taking to flight , the saker 's sharp wings cut the air like two knives sharpened one against the other . Though most of the steppe is gently rolling , with plateaus , there are glimmering flat regions where the horizon seems so near that giant horsemen rise between the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called deels , the horsemen appear mythic , and the horses seem more ancient still , with their chunky bodies and thin legs and the crude lumpy heads of Eohippus . Some of their goats , too , look archaic , with crazy yellow eyes and outsize horns , whereas the sheep and cattle they herd appear modern  --  that is to say , dulled and stupid in appearance and comportment , befitting animals that have given up all sense of anything but satiation , content to be shunted about in bawling herds . The two-humped camels are used almost entirely as draft animals , dragging small two-wheeled covered carts jammed with household possessions when the grazing gives out and the time comes to move the herds and gers . Once a new camp is made , these carts , tilted forward onto their shafts and parked in a line outside the ger , are used as storage bins and hitching posts for one or more horses , which , in this horse culture , are kept saddled from daybreak until nightfall . Since but 1 percent of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the date of the last frost in spring are as capricious as this summer weather , field agriculture is of minor importance . Later that day , less than an hour east of the settlement of Ondorhaan , the axle sheared and one wheel spun off the two-wheel wagon , bouncing and leaping behind Dorj 's car , bringing our expedition to a sudden halt . With Dorj and Tseveen , Chuka set off for a mining settlement fifteen miles away , while Bold guarded the dumped cargo and Harris , Go , Dawadav , and I took advantage of the delay to run down , catch , and band two chicks of some unsuspecting demoiselles that had drawn too near the scene of our calamity . On a nearby hilltop stood a ger with a large corral , and inevitably its master , a big Mongol in a night-blue deel with orange sash , mounted his horse and with his boy and his ancient hammer rifle rode down to inspect the cart and commiserate over the vagaries of fate . Having then remounted and ridden away , crossing the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which tough Mongol horses can maintain for hours , the pair returned toward twilight with a fresh-killed marmot , a local delicacy , which they flung down before our camp as a gracious token of steppe hospitality . Not until long after dark did the others return with a tough old cart bought at the mining village , and so we made camp that night near the track , knowing that out here on the east-west highway no vehicle would disturb our sleep . Following a breakfast of fatty marmot , served cold with rice and tepid coffee , we followed the track east through grass that , though still utterly treeless , without so much as a poor shrub , was becoming taller and less sparse , with a gradual change in the bird fauna . The cranes were fewer in this long-grass country , and there were no falcons . Only the wheatears and the larks seemed undiminished in their numbers . That night we camped east of Choybalsan , the only town of any size in the eastern part of Mongolia , and the next day headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain , over empty grassland without gers or horses . Birds of all kinds seemed very scarce , and a solitary pair of demoiselles , without a chick , were the only cranes we would record . However , we did see a crane relative called the great bustard , which carries itself like a short-necked , short-bodied , and short-legged crane  --  less graceful , perhaps , but just as dignified . Flaring white on the wings , the bustard lifted heavily from the thick grass and pounded away over the steppe . This huge steppe bird , once relatively common to Russia but now almost gone , is one of the rare species we had hoped to find in these wilder regions of Mongolia . Where thick grass eventually gave way to short sparse growth , there appeared a flock of more than sixty demoiselles . At this season , the flocks are mostly composed of immature birds as well as pairs that failed to breed or bred but lost their chicks to raptors or mammal predators . Perhaps these cranes were already assembling in the first stirrings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and bear them south on a long journey across the Central Asian deserts , the Altai Range , and the great Takla Makan Desert , the remote Kunlun Mountains and Tibet , then across the Himalayas to the Ganges plain . Many will soar down the deep gorge of the Kali Gandaki River , which parts the snowy peaks between Annapurna and Dhaulagiri , and some will be carried high by its great winds . The elegant and airy demoiselle has been recorded five miles above sea level , passing the shining peak of Annapurna . The track bore east over the plateau , and below , great curves of the Kerulen appeared . This river plain that was our first destination looked wild and all but uninhabited , yet appeared too dry to attract the white-naped crane . But as the track moved close to the reedy margins , the plain came alive with birds  --  swan geese and greylags , spot-billed ducks , herons and cormorants , terns and gulls , myriad sandpipers . On a grassy site overlooking a broad oxbow lagoon known as Tsagaan Sum ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rubble  --  all that remains of a Buddhist temple torn down in this place during the great anti-clerical purges of the 1930s . The steppe tracks and this mute heap , circled by swallows , were the only signs of man in the broad landscape . On a high bank along a deep bend in the river , Bold and Tseveen located their old camp of a few years ago , when they had recorded their first sighting of the white-naped along the Kerulen . Bold produced a set of small red cups and a bottle of arak , as we listened to the murmur of the river , and the wail of lapwings and the cry of crakes and the primordial wood-block rattle of the demoiselles . The demoiselles do not produce the clear bugling of their larger relatives , including Grus vipio  --  the sound that everybody listened for that night but failed to hear . A dawn rain cleared off early . Not having to break camp , we departed quickly on a downriver crane hunt that would take us all the way to the China border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a vast pale expanse of water called Khoyor Melkhit ( Two Frog Lake ) , and as we drew near I saw an immense bird a half mile away , in the southeast corner of the lake , behind a gathering of gray herons . " See that big bird ? " I yelled , as Jim yelled , " Stop ! " A superb adult white-naped crane stood transfixed by the dust of the braking vehicles , but in a moment it rose rapidly from the shore with hard upward flicks of its nearly four-foot wings . This hard-flicking flight looked like threat display that one would expect to see in a breeding bird , and of course we hoped that somewhere nearby a mate and chicks awaited this majestic creature that flew away over the silver lake , its long neck and legs in silhouette against the eastern sun that rose up from the blue mountains of China . Later in the day we proceeded north to some small lakes where Bold believed the lone white-naped might have headed , but in this season the lakes were dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nondescript shy birds , young Oriental plover . On our way back to camp , however , the vehicles flushed three cranes out of the marsh , and Harris , snatching up binoculars , called out , " Those are n't demoiselles ! " A moment later he identified them as common , or Eurasian , cranes . With Go , I walked across the plain to where the birds had settled down under the bluffs and was able to study through a telescope the first Grus grus seen on this journey . The white-crowned , black-throated , gray Eurasians were much larger than the demoiselles nearby , though considerably smaller than the Grus vipio . Like most cranes , the Eurasians are exceptionally wary , and the three birds soon rose up again and crossed over to the marsh north of camp . In a still dawn , two days later , a swan was calling from the lily lakes , solitary , mournful . We were breaking camp when two white-naped cranes flew in from the east , low against the valley rim , and , setting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined temple not far from where , the previous afternoon , we had seen a pair with a gold chick  --  our first evidence of breeding Grus vipio on the Kerulen . Concerned ( if these cranes were those we 'd seen a day earlier ) as to why they might have left their chick , I walked west to the ruin and on past the north end of the lake , circling a bed of yellow blossoms at the marsh edge . Then , perhaps 200 yards ahead , the wary birds rose up from a low slough . With an intruder so close , one would have expected that they would flee , but they only alighted a little farther on , still within good range of my binoculars . They did not walk together , as pairs usually do , but crisscrossed each other 's paths , entering the reeds from separate directions , coming out again , in what looked like an intense and systematic search , and all the while they uttered an odd call , a simple ka-kuk , sometimes only ka , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were calling that chick , as if coaxing it to come in out of hiding . In a few minutes they rose again , only to glide across fifty yards of reeds to alight on a greensward where we 'd seen the white-naped family the day before . There they resumed their intense search . Not once did their heads rise in alarm , nor did they pick and feed in nervousness . Still calling , they hunted in and out among the reeds until finally they did not emerge again . If this was a second pair , as we now supposed , why were they hunting their chick so close to where the others had been yesterday ? Unless the pairs no longer maintained territory , this made no sense . An unwelcome but inevitable explanation thrust itself forward  --  that the golden chick had been taken by some predator . Just as I 'd concluded that this must be so  --  that the first known nesting of the white-naped in the Kerulen had ended in tragedy  --  a young crane emerged from the farther reeds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the adult birds , still calling now and then , had disappeared . I was so excited that I almost yelled , all the more so because this was not the previous afternoon 's chick but a much larger one  --  larger , even , than the tall gray herons past which it ran on its way into the reeds . The gold-brown  --  a deeper color on the nape  --  was in this chick a scruffy brown and gray where new pin feathers had replaced the down . It seemed that the tragedy had been reversed and that this was a separate family , after all . I saw no more sign of the cranes , and they stopped calling . At any rate , I had had a superb opportunity to study Grus vipio at close range and in good light . With its golden eye in a bright red and white head , and the shining white column of its nape in the fresh morning reeds extending down to the warm silver of the mantle , with throat and belly of a darker gray that seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its angle to the sun , it is surely the most " oriental " of the cranes , and the most striking . Though we had established that Grus vipio bred in the Kerulen , the species was not there in any numbers , and so the expedition proceeded northward over the plateaus , across high plains , with steppe eagles and Mongolian gazelles  --  husky long-faced animals , uniform in tawny coloration but for the creamy rump . On the Daurian Steppe , the grass thickened once again , with more wildflowers  --  pale lavender aster and deep lavender thistle , night-blue spiky thistle , yellow lilies . The track wound eastward for some miles , then west to the border town of Ereentsav and the great Lake Tari . Beyond lay grassland and here , to the north , on a low hill of Siberia , stood a mixed stand of conifers and poplar . Farther on , where the track ran beside barbed-wire fencing on the border , huge red machines of Siberian collectives were parked at the ends of long grainfields separated by high windbreaks of tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reed pond in Mongolia , flew low across the track and wire fencing and glided down into the Russian grain , where they joined eleven of their own species , seventeen demoiselles , and two Eurasian cranes , all in one flock . To view them better I left the car and ran ahead along the fence , as a new flock of mixed Eurasians and white-naped crossed into Russia . The white-naped alighted , but the Eurasians sailed on over the poplar break to the adjoining field , where they joined two groups of feeding demoiselles . Some of these cranes looked as black as crows , with a heavy-set appearance , and when they raised white heads and necks , I yelled , " Hooded ! " The natural history of the hooded crane is very little known ( no nest was discovered until 1974 ) . Like Grus vipio , it is one of Asia 's rarest cranes , with a population of perhaps 4,500 , and I 'd never seen one . Harris , coming up the road , questioned the sighting , but a moment later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From where we stood , we counted forty demoiselles , sixteen Eurasians , thirteen white-naped , and thirteen hoodeds . I was elated , and Jim , too . With all his experience with wild cranes in many countries , he had never before seen four species in a single sighting , not even among the great crane assemblies at Poyang Lake in southeastern China , where four crane species regularly spend the winter . It was August now and we began our return west , heading up the valley of the Uldz River . With low sad callings , two swans crossed the rolling hills of grass on a day of dire cloud and restless wind that gave this landscape the strong monotone cast of the Arctic tundra . Where the herds had been , the river grass was cropped right to its banks , and in other stretches , in the floodlands , the water was braided widely through the willows . In a grassy place I found a hedgehog that rolled itself into a tight small ball . I turned it gently , pulling apart a thorny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and black shiny nose . There were many swans at White Shears Lake , where Bold and Tseveen had seen a Siberian crane in June of 1981 . ( With forty-five years of wild-bird study between them , these two Mongolian ornithologists had recorded the Siberian only three times . ) But farther on , from a river bluff , we saw eight black storks , another rare species of this region . Like so many other species of the steppe , black storks can migrate as far as Africa ; I 'd last seen black storks in 1990 , circling the Victoria Falls Hotel in the Zimbabwe sky . A pair of demoiselles fluttered and danced on the riverbank , strengthening the pair bond , even as we ran out into the marsh and captured and banded the nearly fledged chick of another pair . In doing so , we put to flight a pair of white-naped in a stubble field that seemed to circle back a bit too soon . When Chuka got a glimpse of the chick 's head , we ran over and eventually found it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first white-naped . Thinking a second chick might show itself , I crouched nearby after the first one was removed , hoping the adults ' behavior would lead me to it . And soon they alighted not far away and crisscrossed in broad arcs all around me , until what was probably the male was within stoning distance , craning and peering over the field stubble , bill agape , gold eye flashing red reflections in the wild red face , soft gray wings silver in the stormy light . I had never seen a more splendid bird in all my life . No chick showed itself ; perhaps there was just one . When the chick was released , its parents kept their distance . They neither called nor moved toward it , and though it was peeping , it did not run to them , seeming to know it should hurry at once toward the cover of the river shrubs while they , almost aloofly , did the same . The monsoon had arrived , and in steady rain we journeyed west each day , censusing and banding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the golden and white-tailed eagles , black storks , and great bustards . But the truly exciting thing that we were seeing was an extraordinary plenitude of white-naped cranes . A white-naped crane at the Dalt River , a tributary of the Uldz , then five more and two pairs of Eurasians , with one of the white-naped dancing , leaping , bounding , then two more vipio near the track , then two more , then ten pairs in one small valley , with seven more Eurasians  --  we were astonished . There were vipio every little way along this upper Uldz , but ten separate pairs in just one mile of river meadow was by far the greatest breeding concentration we had heard of anywhere . The broad Uldz Valley narrows in low grassy hills , and soon the track left the Uldz headwaters behind , at a point perhaps 120 miles upstream from Lake Tari . Small trees scattered on the hills gathered into strands of conifers on the higher ridges , and the pines gradually descended as the track gained altitude on its way west . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on a ridge a boy on horseback followed the black grass horizon , bringing in a long slow herd of camels . At the far end of a vast plain , under gray storm light and the shrouded western sun , white clouds drifted over the high mountain ridges . After four days ' rain the plain was an interminable slough , and the vehicles lurched drunkenly and churned and skidded through . A hare with brain transfixed by headlights bounded ahead for minute after minute before jumping aside into the grass . It was past ten when camp was made on a grassy hill , and it was still raining . A cold wind from the western steppe had driven back the weather , which lay massed upon the hills on the far side of the Uldz Valley . A bright dawn illuminated the tents , and the seesaw calls of demoiselles drifted across the steaming grass , and dragging on clothes still dank and cold from the wet crane hunts of the day before , everyone was cheerful . The track continued west . A cinereous vulture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vole out of the grass not thirty yards from our tires . Soon we turned north , departing the Uldz Valley and climbing to a ridge of dark pine and pale larch , then descended to the Onon River , which flows north to the Shilka in Siberia , an upper tributary of the great Amur that flows to the Okhotsk Sea . At the small town of Bayan Adraga ( named for a holy mountain ) , we turned west again , up the Onon , pausing in early afternoon to fish for supper in an Onon tributary , where Chuka brought in a small taimen , a primitive salmonid that in the large Siberian rivers such as the Lena may attain weights of well over one hundred pounds . I 'd caught two small pan fish on my fly rod , and was out on an open river bar , having had a hard strike in a strong riffle , when a black storm rushed in over the mountains  --  tremendous winds and lightning and thunder . Thunder crashed all around as I thrashed across two tributary streams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to reach the vehicles before an avalanche of rain and hail , demonic in ferocity , left the whole river plain ghostly in a strange white slush . The Mongolians were packing up even before the storm relented , so concerned were they that this river plain would be hit in a flash flood , and though we got out of there in time , the main track west was already flooded out . Heading cross-country , we climbed around the track , crossing a ridge of conifers and descending once more to a high bluff where the Khurkh River ( pronounced backwards  --  Hkruhk ! ) joins the swift Onon , with a dramatic view over the confluence to the Hentiyn Mountains . Up there , Bold indicated , pointing northwest , was the sacred mountain of Burkhan Kaldun , which gave shelter from his enemies to the young Temujin , who later took the name of Genghis Khan . Bold wasted not a moment getting ready to go night-fishing for the taimen , which he hoped to entice with a crude furry lure the size of a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was similarly equipped ) , that is dragged slowly across the surface like a struggling swimmer caught in the swift current . But the rain continued and the night was very dark , and we caught nothing but heavy river weeds torn out by storm , and we gave it up until 3:15 A.M. , when I was awakened by Bold 's ferocious old alarm and staggered down in darkness to my pre-selected spot only to find it was a foot beneath the rising river . Also , the water was roily , and under the bluff there was no place to strip my line , let alone backcast , and I retreated to the tent , waiting for light . In a dark daybreak , employing a grotesque rig of my own devising  --  a saltwater spoon heavy enough , when hurled out shot-put fashion , to drag the fly line coiled upon my toes up through the guides and out over the river  --  I managed to foul-hook a taimen that missed its crude swipe at my lure in the murky water and got snared behind the gills instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light equipment . Drawn to the scene by the great thrashing , Chuka dropped his rod and raced to help me even as I shouted at him to stand back , but he was right there in the shallows when finally I brought the fish in close , and he heaved it ashore joyfully with both hands , then up the steep bank onto the grassy bluff . The dull metallic greeny-gray fish with its red tail and pelvic fins measured out at forty inches long  --  a fair fish in the high-altitude waters of Mongolia  --  and proved to be a delicious change from old black goat , which had not improved in its long days of unrefrigerated travel . Nonetheless , the redoubtable Bold ( whose name signifies " hard , " as in hard steel ) was still chiseling stray meat bits from the smoke-blackened skull with its staring teeth and eating them from the point of his old pocket knife . We headed west again under gray skies and intermittent rain , wondering if , on such muddy tracks , we would ever reach Ulan Bator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , the small settlements we were passing had no fuel , not even enough for the tractors that had to cut the hay for the coming winter . That night we spent two hours scrounging precious fuel in Dr. Tseveenmyadag 's brother 's village of Omnodelger . More and more as we penetrated this backcountry , we discovered that the white-naped crane , where protected by the benevolence or superstition of the local herders , did not require large and pristine breeding territories but would nest in a relatively small marsh and within sight of human habitation  --  in one place , with ten gers on three sides of a small lake with limited reed cover for the nest . From a rock outcrop on the valley ridge , I could see up and down the long and lake-eyed valley of the Khurkh , with its white gers , far herds , long-maned horses reflected in still pools , slow camel trains , and grass and grass and grass stretching away in a bright sun to the purple heights of the storm-shrouded mountains . Beyond the knot of my colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents pretended to feed , straightening long white-naped necks every few moments to peer over the reeds at the human beings , then lifting to flap and glide and alight and peer again , from another angle . Up on the ridge , I felt a little sad . Already I was beginning to miss Mongolia , knowing how unlikely it was that I would ever travel here again . Our expedition was coming to an end , and perhaps these white-naped were the last that we would see , for we were far from the Uldz Valley now and close to the western end of their range ( Grus vipio had been observed west of Ulan Bator , but to date no breeding pairs have been verified ) . But toward six that evening , in a broad valley of shallow lakes , there were twenty-six of them in sight at once , the largest group observed on the whole journey , and one that seemed to justify our conclusion that this far western region of the Daurian Steppe , in the upper valleys of the Uldz and Khurkh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the pairs had a large chick , and Tseveen went straight to the nearest ger . Within minutes he was galloping with a young horseman the two or three miles to where the chick , much too big to hide and very nearly fledged , set off on a wild flapping run across a reed bed and out onto the plain . Jouncing and swerving at dangerous speed , our car cut off its escape and we jumped out to surround it . In the end , Jim Harris bravely grasped it by the neck and subdued it without harming the crane or himself , though he was nicked by its sharp toenails in the process . " This is the first dangerous bird we 've handled , " he said later , though he was not thinking about toenails at the time . Already this bird was a beautiful fawn color where the rich white nape was going to be , and at this size , so nearly fledged , its bill had hardened ; given a chance , it would aim for the eyes . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not flee but turned around and advanced upon Go Fujita , then fluttered upward , pecking toward his face . Not until it drove him back did the young crane turn away and , in no great hurry , stalk away across the plain , crossly shuffling its new feathers , shaking the bright green ring around its leg .
