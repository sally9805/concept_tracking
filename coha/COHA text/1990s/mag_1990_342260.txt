One morning two years ago , a 60-year-old woman in Madison , Wis. , asked her doctor what seemed like a simple question . The patient had just reached menopause and wanted to know whether she should start taking aspirin daily . She had seen newspaper and TV reports claiming that the pills lower the risk of heart attacks , and she knew such risks increase dramatically for women after they stop menstruating . " My answer was dead silence , " says the woman 's physician , Dr. Elizabeth Karlin , who teaches at the University of Wisconsin medical school . A week later , after scouring the literature , Karlin came to what she called an " appalling " conclusion : the finding , trumpeted in some newspapers as a lifesaver for everyone , was based entirely upon research on men . " There were simply no data to say this was safe for women . " <P> Karlin had discovered an information gap that may be endangering millions of American women . A number of treatments now recommended for men and women  --  from cholesterol-lowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been studied almost exclusively in men . Little hard evidence exists about their efficacy or safety for women . The problem has begun to concern doctors , patients and now lawmakers . In June Congress 's General Accounting Office released a report condemning the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) for failing to promote studies that took adequate account of the differences between the sexes . The Congressional Caucus for Women 's Issues , which commissioned the study , introduced a $237 million legislative package in July aimed at achieving " parity in medical research . " Said caucus co-chair Patricia Schroeder of Colorado : " Doctors are n't getting the kind of guidance they need when they try to prescribe for women . " <P> Medical testing done entirely with male subjects may be adequate when a disease strikes women and men in the same way , but a growing body of research shows that this is often not the case . Some preliminary studies on depression , for example , suggest that hormonal changes in many women may lead to a premenstrual deepening of depression . Further research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , says Dr. Jean Hamilton , a Washington-based neuropharmacologist , to determine if female patients are getting adequate medication . <P> Women 's hearts also differ markedly from men 's . Not only does cardiovascular disease strike women later in life , but blood cholesterol levels seem to play a somewhat different role in female patients . Dr. John Crouse , a lipids researcher at Bowman Gray School of Medicine in North Carolina , notes that women seem to be less vulnerable than men to high levels of LDL , the so-called bad cholesterol , and more vulnerable to low levels of HDL , the " good " cholesterol . Diets that reduce both levels , such as the one promoted by the American Heart Association , may actually harm women , Crouse argues . The dearth of data on women and heart disease may also have contributed to an alarming problem : women are significantly more likely than men to die after they undergo heart-bypass surgery . One reason , suggested a study last spring , is that doctors are slower to spot serious heart trouble in their female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
