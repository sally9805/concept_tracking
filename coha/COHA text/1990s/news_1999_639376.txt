<p> ASPEN - The woman in Russia , the man in Colorado . They met on the Internet , but theirs was an old-fashioned courtship of letters and long phone calls before they married last summer in this mountain town . <p> And when the rain came down in sheets as they were wed in the gazebo at Paepcke Park , Valentina and Earl Anderson choose to consider that a shower of good wishes for their future . <p> Their proof : This summer they 're rejoicing in the birth of a son , a brother for Valentina 's 9-year-old son , Eddie . They 're also considering the idea of starting an agency to introduce other Russian and American singles . <p> " It was n't even like a mail order bride , " Earl says thoughtfully of their relationship . " We met on the Internet , but we got to know each other like old-time pen pals . " For three months , they wrote letters and racked up horrendous phone bills , a stunning $ 3,000 for one month when the phone carrier changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents to $ 3 a minute . <p> Earl , who has his own design and architecture firm in Aspen , had recently broken up with a girlfriend . He came home one night and began casually browsing through the introduction services on the Internet . On one Web site alone he found about 50 women he thought looked interesting . <p> " Say I 'm one of thousands , it sounds better , " teases Valentina , poking him lightly on the arm . <p> " Thousands , " her husband amends , grinning a moment before continuing . " I have this philosophy about relationships . There are a lot of people in the world , and many would be nice to know . I like American girls , I 've dated a lot of American girls but I had just turned 40 , and I thought the last thing I needed was another girlfriend . It was time to settle down . " <p> The picture of Valentina , a very pretty slim blond framed against a backdrop of lilacs on her Web page , put her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 15 women , accompanied by letters of the " Hi , this is where I live , what I do , what I am " type . He had studied Russian with an Aspen friend and traveled there in 1995 , so he wrote in Russian and English . That pleased Valentina . She was the first of the 15 to write back . <p> " You know why ? Because I like you , " she proclaims . Her Web page read " I wish to meet a man with the same interests , one who is a leader , kind , responsible , affectionate , intelligent , with a sense of humor . " She listed music , sports , travel , books , photography and theater as hobbies , and got many responses . <p> " I had letters from all over - France , Germany , all over - but they usually were boring , " she adds . " I liked Earl 's picture and read his letter , and he said things I liked - ' I love life , I love God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered him . " <p> When he got the letter , Earl hurried to call Valentina , which surprised her . It was the first of dozens of conversations they shared in a mixture of English and Russian . Along the way , she shared her life history . <p> Valentina was a year old when she was placed in an orphanage and lived there six years before being sent to boarding school . There she learned she had twin brothers 18 months older and was able to establish contact . <p> A natural athlete , she excelled in basketball , volleyball and pingpong , among other sports ; by age 16 she was an accomplished runner , which opened doors to further education . She worked in a hospital , a kindergarten , attended a sport academy and traveled for competitions before becoming a private sports trainer and wedding photographer . She married , had Eddie and later divorced . <p> Valentina learned English from school and television , enough that she and Eddie spent six months visiting friends in Florida in 1996 . <p> She 's the winner <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Earl boasts , " basketball , Chinese checkers , she always beats me . " That 's even though he competed in high school football , basketball , track and swimming , then danced 16 years with Ballet West and the Aspen Ballet Company . <p> Valentina leans over and hugs him , adding a kiss : " That 's why I love you , " she coos . <p> Swimming is the only thing he does better : " I jumped in the pool and almost drowned , " Valentina says dramatically , waving her arms about as she mimics her floundering . <p> In April 1998 , Anderson made the long journey halfway around the world to meet Valentina and Eddie . " To say she lived in the middle of nowhere is an understatement . It 's pure luck we got together , " he says firmly . <p> Mother and son lived in a rural area outside St. Petersburg , in the city of Gatchina , a cluster of high-rise residential buildings somewhat like an American campus but without a city around it . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I was a little nervous to see him , and when I did , I thought ' Oh , my goodness , ohhh , he looks nice , " ' Valentina recalls . <p> " We had spoken for three months , so we really knew each other , " Anderson says . " The missing key was - was there chemistry ? When I saw her , it was confirmation of what I thought we had baked the cake of our relationship , we were truly friends , and the chemistry was the icing on the cake . " <p> His wife concurs : " I wanted a friend , but a lover and husband would top it all . " <p> For two weeks the American participated in her daily life as a teacher , teaching her students ballet steps . They attended aerobics class , went sightseeing and got to know each other . Marriage , they agreed , was the next step . Anderson returned to Aspen and they began to make their plans . <p> On her 29th birthday , July 30 , Valentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago . Customs delays made them miss their connecting flight to Denver . Earl waited impatiently at Denver International Airport , wearing his " groom hat , " carrying a bouquet and wondering if she decided to stay in Russia . <p> The airlines have a rule against reporting an individual 's flight status , but Earl begged so piteously that a sympathetic agent finally did a trace and found the Russian pair still in Chicago . <p> " I begged this agent to do something , said that Aspen was four hours from DIA , and we had 100 people coming to the wedding the next day , " Earl remembers . " ' I 'll get them on a flight tonight , ' the agent promised , and she did . " <p> While he waited , the groom shopped for rings and wedding dresses , the things they had planned to do together . As promised , Valentina and Eddie arrived that evening - at 11:30 p.m. - " She had n't slept for two days , and she looked fantastic , " Earl says . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and awoke to a wedding-day downpour . Earl and Valentina were married in spite of it , in the midst of a sea of umbrellas . <p> " We rode about town in a horse-drawn carriage after the wedding , the sun was out , and everything looked wonderful , " Earl reports . " Valentina could n't believe it was such a beautiful town . She could n't believe that this was to be her home . " Second son born <p> Daniel , a chubby baby with a sunny disposition , was born in April . Eddie , a tall stringbean of a child , will be in the fourth grade and gets daily English tutoring in school . Earl is in the process of adopting him . <p> " He 's like an American boy - ' I want this , I want that , " ' his mother reports with some exasperation . " We told him he had to work , so he started a lemonade stand , and he 's had to save money , too . " <p> Valentina describes her husband as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control me , " and reports that his family " has been so good to me , they are my family . " The woman who grew up an orphan also joined Earl 's church , the Church of the Latter-day Saints , " because it 's about family , " she says . <p> Just after their first anniversary this year , the Andersons went to Bountiful , Utah , to cement a relationship they describe as meaningful and lasting . On Aug. 14 , they were wed in a covenant marriage for eternity in the Mormon temple . <p> " Life is not perfect , nor are relationships , " Earl says , " but I found the perfect woman for me. "
