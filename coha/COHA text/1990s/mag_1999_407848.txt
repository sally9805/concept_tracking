How 3 common conditions were treated 10 years ago-and how they 're treated now . By Colleen Dunn Bates // As recently as three years ago , medicine came in two forms : conventional and alternative . Many mainstream doctors looked down their noses at such treatments as herbs and acupuncture , but patients sought them out anyway . " Conventional medicine is so good at keeping us alive , " says Wayne Jonas , M.D. , former director of the Office of Alternative Medicine ( OAM ) , a division of the National Institutes of Health . " But it is n't as good at dealing with chronic problems . " Over the last few years , a quiet revolution has been taking place in our health-care system . One sign of the rapid upheaval is that the word " alternative " is now a bit outdated . The OAM , for example , recently changed its name to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM ) and its research funding has skyrocketed from $2 million in 1993 to $50 million in 1999 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " signifying the merging of the erstwhile " alternative " with the mainstream . Another indication of the shift in health care is that universities are opening research centers funded by the NCCAM to determine the value of such treatments as St. Johnswort and biofeedback . Plus , patient clinics that integrate conventional and " unconventional " health care are not only opening all over the country , they have long waiting lists just to get an appointment ( see sidebar , " Leading Integrative Clinics " ) . Even HMOs have begun incorporating such services as chiropractic and acupuncture . Obviously , much of this transformation stems from consumer demand . A 1998 study conducted by Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program , for instance , found that nearly 70 percent of its young and middle-aged adult members wanted integrative therapies incorporated into their health care . " And more physicians and health-care managers are beginning to feel that some of these therapies are clinically effective , " Jonas says - especially acupuncture , the most well-researched of all the complementary " traditional " therapies ( traditional because therapies like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Besides acupuncture ( whose efficacy was established in a 1997 NIH report ) research for other complementary techniques is weaker , particularly with chiropractic , and research for massage and homeopathy is spottier still . As recently as five to 10 years ago , the three common health conditions that follow were treated conventionally - with drugs or surgery . Today , those conventional therapies are still used , but now physicians augment them with complementary treatments . Here 's a look at how medicine has advanced during the past decade . Migraine headache Treatment 5-10 years ago : To cope with these crippling headaches , doctors mostly prescribed one of a host of drugs , some of which are preventive and some of which relieve pain once a migraine starts . Treatment today : You name it , someone 's trying it . Although the 1997 NIH report on acupuncture did n't address migraine , Brian Berman , M.D. , a principal investigator for the NIH and founder and director of the University of Maryland Complementary Medicine Program , recently conducted a formal review of migraine and acupuncture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preventive , to lessen both the frequency and severity of migraine attacks , " he says . Why it works is not known precisely ; it may be because it stimuLates the production of endorphins , which relieve general pain , and because it reduces stress , which often spurs migraines . Some of the best preventive success is with biofeedback , in which a specialist ( often a psychologist or other health professional ) uses electronic devices to measure a patient 's physiology from the surface of her skin . These devices monitor the slightest fluctuations in bodily actions like muscle tension , heart rate and skin temperature ( which reflects blood flow ) . Using relaxation and imagery techniques , the specialist and patient try to modify these physiological reactions , while monitoring changes via the skin sensors and computer-based displays . " The most traditional biofeedback preventive treatment for migraine is to try to warm the hands , " says Mark S. Schwartz , Ph.D. , psychologist and biofeedback specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville , Fla . " I wish I could explain why it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Using concentration and various types of muscle and breathing relaxation techniques which can increase blood flow , many patients are able to actually warm their hands , and this is often linked with a reduction in the occurrence of migraines . In fact , because migraines are complex , a good complementary clinic will use varying combinations of nutrition , stress reduction , acupuncture , self  --  hypnosis , biofeedback and perhaps a daily dose of the herb feverfew ( which has some promising , if inconclusive , research to support its effectiveness as a migraine preventive ) . Most alternative methods are preventives and therefore not effective once the pain has kicked in , so a complementary physician also may prescribe conventional drugs as needed . Colds &; Flu Treatment 5-10 years ago : Flu shots were gaining prominence as a preventive , but once a cold or flu hit , doctors advised rest , fluids and over-the-counter symptom relief . Treatment today : The integrative approach does n't vary much from the medicine of 10 years ago , except for the use of herbal medicines along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research suggests that echinacea may boost the immune system , thereby helping colds and flu go away faster . Since it seems quite safe if taken no more than two weeks at a time ( with at least a week off in between ) , echinacea has become very popular . " There 's also a little evidence to support the use of zinc lozenges , " Berman adds , " and a couple of good studies showed that the homeopathic product oscillococcinum shortens the course of colds and flus . " Depression Treatment 5-10 years ago : Our Prozac nation was in full swing : Depressed people were treated with psychiatric counseling and new breeds of anti-depressant drugs . Treatment today : In her work as director of the Mind/Body Center for Women 's Health at Harvard , Alice Domar , Ph.D. , sees a lot of depressed patients . " Some mind/body practices  --  especially exercise and therapy  --  can be very effective with mild depression , " she says . Domar steers clear of the most widely known mind/body technique , the meditative relaxation response , for depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper depression . For mild depression , exercise is essential . " It 's the treatment of choice , and it 's especially effective with seasonal affective disorder , " says Domar . Next comes cognitive behavioral therapy , in which the therapist helps you find the thoughts that are making you depressed , then helps you challenge those thoughts . Third is writing in a journal , which helps you process your sadness and move on . Finally , the therapist helps you build social support , since isolation and loneliness are a source of depression . The most common treatment for mild to severe depression still remains drugs alone . " But we do n't know what the long-term risks of these medications are , " Domar says . The integrative approach uses drugs when necessary in combination with complementary therapies . " We add acupuncture sometimes , " says Berman , " to stimulate all those neurotransmitters , which is what the drugs do . " And many integrative doctors have their patients try St. Johnswort , an herb with a fair amount of clinical research supporting its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND TENNIS ELBOW Tennis elbow is still an extraordinarily difficult condition to treat , say physicians . But after anti-inflammatories , stretching and physical therapy , acupuncture is a very effective way to bring down the inflammation without causing tissue damage . Sidebar CHOOSING THE RIGHT INTEGRATIVE CARE Any old doc who took an acupuncture class can set up an integrative health clinic , so be on the lookout for new-medicine quackery . Wayne Jonas , M.D. , former head of the federal Office of Alternative Medicine , offers the following guidelines : SEEK OUT * A clinic that truly integrates the new - such as acupuncture and biofeedback - with the traditional . " Licensed M.D.s should be involved in the overall care , especially in the diagnostic process . " * Practitioners who are licensed by the state and certified by the leading national organizations in their specialty. * Good record-keeping and synergy with the larger community . " The clinic should be willing and able to send your records to your primary physician , and to provide referrals to other specialists . " * Upfront communication of costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Practices and products that offer cure-alls . " Some will lead you to believe they can solve everything from your anxieties to your money problems , " says Jonas. * " Secret " formulas . " A real red flag . " * Any practice that is isolated from the community and unwilling to work with your physician . * A place that sells packages of services and/or products . " If an acupuncturist tells you he 'll get you to quit smoking in 15 visits , but you have to pay for all 15 upfront , stay away . " * Any practice that sells such products as herbs or weight-loss supplements in multilevel marketing ( aka pyramid ) systems .
