Beatrice needed a new liver . Her old one had succumbed to damage suffered in a fall one month earlier from the top of a seven-story parking garage . She lay in a coma while the hospital prepared for her imminent transplant , but she was not asleep . That part of her which was not her broken body stood by her bed in the surgical intensive care unit and watched as a nurse leaned over to draw her blood . <p> Beatrice 's unusual condition gave her access to aspects of people which usually are utterly private . So she knew that the nurse , whose name was Judy , was thinking of her husband . It was eleven-thirty p.m. , just about his bedtime , and Judy imagined him settling down to sleep . He would take off his shirt and his pants and fold the sheet down neatly so it covered him to just past his hips . He would turn on his side and put a hand under his cheek . Judy missed acutely the space between his shoulder blades , into which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep to come . <p> Distracted , she missed the vein , and cursed softly when she noticed that no blood came into the tube . Beatrice 's body lay unprotesting as Judy shifted the needle beneath her skin , questing after the already sorely-abused vein . Beatrice did not feel it when Judy found the vein and the borrowed blood ( in the first hours of her stay Beatrice had received a complete transfusion ) slipped quietly into a red-topped tube . When that one was full Judy proceeded to fill a gray-topped tube , a lavender-topped tube , and finally a tube with a rubber stopper the color of freshly-laid robin 's eggs . <p> Judy straightened up and stared at her patient as her hands went automatically about the business of attaching red-numbered labels to the tubes . Beatrice was a medium-sized woman with rich curly red hair but otherwise unremarkable features . Beneath obscuring tubes and wires , her skin was pale and slightly greenish , and under her spare hospital nightie her once generous form was getting bony . In the same way , her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission , when it was bright and coppery . Now it was duller , though still pretty , and at the roots it had darkened to a muddy , bloody color . As she wrapped the tubes in a laboratory requisition form and tucked the little package into a plastic bag , Judy resolved to come back and give Beatrice 's hair a full one hundred strokes of brushing . This seemed to Beatrice , who no longer cared about her hair , a waste of time . <p> The blood neatly and safely organized , and all her sharps-waste disposed of , Judy turned on her heel and walked out of the semiprivate recess that Beatrice occupied in the first bay of the SICU . Judy walked down the bay , nodding at the nurses and doctors whose eyes she caught . Beatrice followed her out . She was nodding at people , too . No one saw her . <p> Judy walked up to the front desk , where a perpetually idle nursing assistant named Frank was flipping through an old issue of Reader 's Digest and looking bored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushing the blood at him . " Take this up to the lab and tell them it 's extra-stat . " <p> " Sure thing , " he said , closing his magazine . He took the blood from her and felt a familiar wave of dislike pass over him . Mouseface , he thought to himself . Others in the SICU agreed with him that Judy had mousy features : a small , forward-sloping face beset with a long , thin nose ; prominent , well-cared-for front teeth . Whenever Judy was in a mood and taking it out on the other nursing staff , he would whisper to one of his friends , " Perhaps the rodent would like a piece of cheese . " He had not gone so far as to leave a piece of cheddar in her locker , but he planned to do that one day . <p> The thought of her expression as she beheld the cheese sitting on top of her street shoes , and the thought that followed that one , of her bending down with alacrity and nibbling it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way out of the bay , even as another nurse hurried up to him with a full gallon jug of urine to carry up to the lab . Beatrice , who did not find any of the mouse business amusing , and did not particularly care for Frank , followed him out of the SICU , walking just a few steps behind him and watching as he swung the jug of urine back and forth and hummed to himself . <p> Walking down the wide hospital hallway , Frank looked out the enormous windows on his right . Outside it was snowing , but he could just barely see that . What the windows showed him was mainly his own reflection . Looking at himself , he regretted not wearing a shirt beneath his scrubs , because he thought the cut of his sleeves made his arms look thin and weak . <p> He took the elevator labeled EE up to the sixth floor , not noticing that Beatrice had stepped in behind him . On the sixth floor he walked straight out of the elevator and down a hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature was a shiny black grand piano . The atrium extended in a shaft up through every floor of the hospital . Sometimes people came in and played something cheery on the piano , but never during his shift . Beatrice had heard them during the day . Her favorite was a little Mennonite girl who sat primly under her paper hat and played hymns . Turning right , away from the hallway , Frank and Beatrice entered the demesne of the pathology department . <p> Frank was always surprised by how nice it smelled there , not at all like a hospital , or even like a lab . There were no foul odors like what proceeded from people with failed kidneys , nor any sharp chemical smells to make your nose itch . Rather , the lab smelled like the perfume of the beautiful women who worked there . To Beatrice it smelled sweet also , mostly because there were people there whom she counted as friends , though none of them had ever met her . The lab was one of her favorite places to spend time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's friends , a blueeyed hematology technologist with poor dental hygiene but very handsome hips . His name was Denis . He was n't there when Frank dropped off the blood and urine . Two women and one man were intent on their computer screens , typing in various patient information , ordering tests , and entering results . They did not notice Frank in the window . <p> " Stat ! " Frank shouted , and had a feeling like a smile in his belly when they all jumped . Beatrice wanted to smack him . <p> " Thank you , " said the man , a funny-looking , taciturn fellow with enormous ears . " You can leave it there . " <p> " It 's super-stat , " said Frank , setting the urine in the window . <p> " All right , " said the man . <p> " We need you to get right on it . This lady 's getting her transplant started in the morning . " <p> " Right , " said one of the women , who was thin with long straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green and gold . She rolled her chair over to the window and snatched the blood from his hand . <p> " Thank you , " she said , setting the tubes next to her computer terminal but doing nothing with them . Her name was Bonnie . She made a show of being focused on her screen , waiting for Frank to go away . Go away , she thought , exerting the full force of her will upon the odious nursing assistant . Beatrice tried to help her out and wished fervently that Frank would return to his hell of shrewish nurses . <p> " He 's gone " said the man with the ears . His name was Luke . <p> " I ca n't stand the way that guy looks at me , said Bonnie , adroitly unwrapping the blood , unfolding the requisition , and entering the requested tests into the computer . <p> " Like a snake , " said Olivia , the other woman . <p> " Damn ! " said Bonnie . She 'd noticed that the urine had no name on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hall , " Hey , urine boy ! " If Frank heard , he made no response . <p> " What 's wrong ? " asked Luke . <p> " They did n't label the urine . What a pain in my ass . " <p> " I 'll call them , " he said . <p> " Thanks , " Bonnie said . She watched Luke as he got up and walked over to the phone , wondering why he always cut his hair so short instead of leaving it long to cover his silly ears . They really are very large , she thought , and wondered if that signified anything , in terms of personality . Men with large hands were said to possess large penises , red-haired people were said to be volatile , but she had never heard anything special said about people with large ears , except maybe that they heard a little better than most folks . Someone might have told her that , maybe her grandmother or her sixth-grade science teacher . To Beatrice , Luke 's ears indicated oafishness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But regardless of the ears , Beatrice found herself partial to Luke . <p> Luke hung up the phone and said , " They 're sending it up . Behind him self-adhesive labels were printing out for Beatrice 's specimens . Bonnie looked him up and down again , and thought about how she might have found him attractive in some other lifetime , one with different standards of beauty . For what seemed to her the hundredth time she imagined him shirtless and was disappointed . She got up from her chair and handed the specimens to Olivia . " Would you label these , please ? " she asked . <p> " Sure , " she said . " Hey , it 's the jumping lady ! " <p> " Is it ? " said Bonnie . " I did n't notice . " <p> " I wonder how she 's doing , " said Luke . <p> " Not too well , " said Bonnie , " if she needs a new liver . " <p> " But as well as can be expected , " said Olivia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labeling intently . <p> " You really should wear gloves when you do that , " said Luke . <p> " I know , " said Olivia . <p> " One of the tubes might break in your hand . Then where would you be ? " <p> " All bloody , " said Bonnie . " I know . It happened to me once . Lucky I had gloves on . " <p> " Would you like me to put on some gloves ? " Olivia asked Luke . <p> " I do n't care , " he said . " It was just a suggestion . " <p> " Jesus , " said Olivia . Beatrice came through the window and stood next to her . You have nothing to fear from my blood , she said , but Olivia did not hear her . <p> Olivia was , in fact , wishing she had put on a pair of gloves . She smoothed a label onto the round edges of a lavender-topped tube and suffered from the perversity of her imagination . She imagined the tube breaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piercing her thumb to the bone , inoculating her with the jumping lady 's blood and whatever diseases it carried . In the same way she sometimes imagined being a bystander in a bank robbery , standing behind a security guard when he got shot with such force that the bullet passed right through him and into her . Who could tell what she might get ? Who could speculate on the habits of that security guard , and whether or not they spelled death for her ? <p> Olivia shook her head and walked the blood through the lab , back into the chemistry section , where Otto , the great big chemistry technologist , sat with his feet up on the Hitachi 747 , a very accomplished machine that was capable of all sorts of magnificently complex chemical analyses of serum and plasma , as well as urine and cerebrospinal fluid , and even stool , provided it was of a sufficiently liquid consistency . Beatrice had followed right behind her , and now she watched as Olivia watched the sleeping Otto , admiring his strong jaw . Olivia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic chemistry class , but she felt no guilt admiring Otto 's jaw , or any other portion of his vast anatomy . <p> " Wake up ; ' she said , putting the red- and the gray-topped tubes in a rack by Otto 's foot . She wiggled the tip of his shoe with her hand . <p> " I 'm not sleeping , " he said . " Just resting my eyes . <p> " Sure , " she said . " You 're not allowed to be tired yet . We 've got seven more hours . " <p> Otto sat up , picked up the tubes , and began to transfer them to his centrifuge . " Oh , " he said . " It 's the jumping lady . " <p> " Yup . ' Olivia walked off towards the hematology section of the lab , then turned back . " I guess you can take some of this for the ammonia level , " she said , offering him the lavender-topped tube . " But give it to Denis as soon as you 're done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thanks . " The thought of having an excuse to go in search of Denis appealed to him . He felt the same way about Denis that Frank and Bonnie did . <p> As quickly as he could , he pulled off a small aliquot of Beatrice 's blood and put it into a small plastic test tube . He was careless in his haste ; a single gorgeous drop fell and landed on his ungloved index finger . Panic flared in him because he thought for a moment that he had a raw hangnail on that finger , but it was actually on the index finger of the other hand . Nevertheless he hurried to the sink and sprayed bleach from a squeeze bottle onto his finger . The smell reminded him of the bathroom he grew up with , which his mother had religiously disinfected , practically after every use . Beatrice stood next to him and said , You have nothing to fear from my blood . <p> When he was all cleaned up , Otto got the ammonia level and other analyses running in the 747 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a magazine full of details about the lives of musicians . Denis looked up when Otto rounded the - 70 deg. freezer . <p> " Hi , " he said . Beatrice came in , sat on the freezer , and began to drum her legs silently against its side . <p> " Hi , there , " said Otto , gazing not at Denis 's hips but at the upper portion of his biceps . Those muscles appealed to him not because they were particularly large ( they were only about a third the size of his own ) but because they were very shapely , and because he could very well imagine himself drifting off to sleep with his cheek resting against them . <p> " What 's up ? " Denis asked . <p> " Got some blood for you . They want a CBC and a diff and a sed rate . " <p> " No problem . " Denis held his hand out for the tube . Otto placed it in his palm , taking care despite himself not to let any part of his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he drew his hand away . <p> " It 's the jumping lady , " said Otto . <p> " Oh , " said Denis . His placid expression belied his true reaction . He thought he could feel his heart rising in his chest , and he wanted to bring the blood to his forehead and hold it there , but of course he did n't . Otto was standing in front of him , looking down and smiling awkwardly . <p> " Looks like she 's getting a transplant , " he said . <p> " Another one ? " <p> " Liver this time . " The previous one had been a kidney . <p> " Where do they get all these organs ? " <p> Otto shrugged . " Got to get to work , " he said , walking away . The phone rang . Denis picked it up and listened for a few moments , then hung up and walked out into the hall . He could see Otto down past the other end , bending over his machine . " Hey , Otto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way ! They 're sending up some donor blood for serology ! " <p> " Okay ! " Otto shouted back . Denis walked back to his lab , sat down , and began to work . He felt very strongly about the jumping lady . It was his conviction that he was in love with her , and had been ever since she had first arrived , ever since he had heard her story and handled her blood for the first time . He closed his magazine and sighed . He leaned his head against the machine that was busy counting and sorting her blood cells by type , waiting for the information , which was precious to him because it concerned her . <p> Beatrice sat and watched him , feeling sad because if she was in love with anyone in the lab , it was not Denis , and was probably nobody , but just might be Luke of the enormous ears . She could not bear to watch Denis mooning over her , so she left his lab through an open back door and headed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow for the arrival of her new liver . <p> She looked out on the city from a familiar height . The hospital , like the parking garage , was seven stories tall . She could see the university campus spread out before her , neatly bisected by the river . When she tried to leave , she got only as far as that river . Some force held her bound to the hospital . She supposed it was her living body , and wished it would die . It was not for no reason at all that she threw herself off the garage . Not that she could recall the reason , in her present state . She only knew that she did not wish to go back , and that it all had to do with a crushing sadness that under which she had labored for most of her life , and which she had never blamed on anybody . <p> She heard the helicopter before she saw it . It was incredibly loud . Covering her ears with her hands , she watched as it came out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flight nurses scramble out , one of them with a Styrofoam cooler held between his hands . Just as they had with the kidney , they would take it downstairs , where doctors would examine it and make it ready for her . After the nurses had disappeared inside the hospital , Beatrice turned and stepped off the roof . <p> It was never like the fall that had brought her here . It was slower , for one thing , and it did her no harm whatsoever . In fact , she fell so slowly that she had time for reflection on various subjects , and this time as she floated down , she watched the snowflakes passing her and thought about her very first boyfriend . His name was Boukman . They had been eight years old together . Her parents had disapproved of him because he was black . They would not let him swim in their pool . This was in Miami , where in the summer it was practically a medical necessity to swim every day . <p> So she swam in his family 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been born of a dog , and that he could fly . These were not his parents who applauded when he and she did synchronized back dives into the pool . His real mother 's name was Queenie , and she was a Great Dane just like Scooby Doo . He was from Haiti . He said such things were common there . She believed him all through the summer , and looked forward to the flying lessons he promised her . <p> On the day of the first lesson , she gave him a lingering kiss on the mouth , and then they ran hand in hand along his flat roof . She balked at the edge and watched him go flying out alone . He went out and straight down to fall directly on his well-formed , closely shaven head . She looked down at the gruesome angle of his neck . Because she was a child , she did not realize right away that he was dead . <p> In later years she wondered if it had been her doubt which cost him his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown over all the low houses of their respectable neighborhood , and scraped their toes against the tops of the highest royal palms ? It seemed unlikely . <p> As she approached the ground , Beatrice realized that Boukman was not the great sadness of her life . It was not for him that she had made her leap , though she would always think of him as the beginning of a long arc of sadness , as the person who taught her that there 's no such thing as a boy who can fly , and that nothing is born of a dog but puppies and blood . <p> Beatrice walked into the ER , following behind a pair of EMTs who were wheeling in a motorcycle accident victim . The few people in the waiting room looked up as the man was pushed past them . He was crying out , " Louise ! Louise ! " at the top of his lungs . Beatrice watched as they rushed him down the hall to the trauma center . Snow swirled in around her before the doors closed again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their entertainment magazines or the television . Walking unseen through the restricted area , Beatrice could hear people having their various emergencies behind the curtains that separated the exam beds . She did not pause to look at the shattered kneecaps or the scalp wounds , or the blue and gray asthmatics wheezing desperately . She walked as quickly as she could , trying to catch up with the flight nurses who were carrying her liver up to surgery . <p> She did n't catch them . Her fall had given them a long start on her . But somewhere near the cardiovascular intensive care unit she happened upon Olivia , who was striding confidently down the hall carrying a phlebotomy basket and singing " Maria . " Beatrice followed her clear across the hospital to the nurseries , where Olivia had been called to perform a blood draw on a brand-new baby . Olivia did not mind being called to do phlebotomy . In fact , she liked very much to escape the confines of the lab , but sometimes it disturbed her to have to cause an infant pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They entered the nursery and saw a large nurse rocking and feeding a baby . The flesh of the nurse 's thighs spilled out from under the armrests of her rocking chair . <p> " There she is , " she said , pointing to a warming bed in a far corner of the room . Beatrice took a moment to admire the cheery decorations : rabbits and ponies and kittens , and a fine triptych of three dogs under a candy bush . The first dog 's eyes were big as saucers , the second 's as big as dessert plates , and the third 's as big as dinner plates . This last picture made Beatrice feel sad . <p> Next to the warming bed , Olivia was preparing the baby for her blood draw . <p> " Hello , darling " she said . " You 're so beautiful ! " She scrubbed vigorously at the baby 's foot with an alcohol-soaked cotton ball . The baby found this a not-unpleasant sensation . Olivia , full of regret , unwrapped a lancet from its sterile foil package and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heel . <p> " Sorry , darling , " said Olivia . The baby , who did not yet have a name but would one day be called Sylvia , did not immediately begin to scream . First a look of perfect incredulity passed over her small face . Only when that had been replaced with an expression of righteous outrage did she begin to scream with such force and volume that Beatrice thought it would blow Olivia 's hair back like a hot wind . <p> " Yes , yes , " said Olivia . " Life is hard . Do n't I know it ? " This is only the beginning , Beatrice whispered behind her . <p> Olivia had caught the heel in the well between her thumb and forefinger , and now she began to squeeze with the full force of her hand . Sometimes Olivia thought she heard the heel bone making crunching noises under the pressure , but Bonnie had assured her that it was all in her head , and that it was quite impossible to crush a baby 's heel because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red pearl of blood had formed from out of the wound , but Olivia wiped this away with a piece of gauze because it was too full of clotting factors to be useful for analysis . She continued squeezing , and caught the next drop in a tiny plastic tube , and the next drop , and then the next . She counted twenty-five of them before she had collected the requisite two hundred and fifty microliters . <p> It took a very long time . The blood was slow to come . Olivia began to experience misery because of the heat lamps that kept the chilly babies warm like so many hamburgers . There was a lamp in the roof of the warming bed , directly above Olivia 's neck where she bent over the baby . She wished for an assistant to wipe away the sweat from her brow before it dripped down onto the baby . Beatrice would have been happy to help her , if she could have . <p> " Like the Sahara under there , is n't it ? " said the fat nurse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm getting dehydrated , " said Olivia , squeezing out the final drop . She capped her tube and put a festive adhesive bandage across the heel . The baby continued to scream , even though both Olivia and Beatrice stroked her arms and belly to try and calm her . Even after they were gone out the door she screamed . Beatrice lingered at the observation window and watched the beet-red baby writhe and scream while the cooing blob of a nurse burped her nursery mate . Beatrice put a hand on the window and said , It only gets worse and worse and worse . <p> When they got back to the lab , Beatrice and Olivia found the others clustered around a table , getting ready to draw each other 's blood . Bonnie looked up at Olivia from where she sat with her bare arm spread out before her . <p> " How 'd it go ? " she asked . <p> " Tough . That baby had blood like glue , but I got it . " <p> " Congratulations . Have you seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's all upset . " <p> " I thought we got one on the jumping lady . I know I labeled one . <p> " Well , he did n't get it . I guess it 's with Jesus now . " " Want to get drawn ? " asked Otto . <p> " Sure , " said Olivia . " Just let me get this back to Denis . " <p> " Bring him back with you ! " Bonnie called out after her . Beatrice stayed behind and watched as Luke stroked the crook of Bonnie 's arm with his gloved hand , trying to get the vein to rise . <p> " Hurry up , " Bonnie said . " This tourniquet is killing me . " <p> " Sorry , " he said . " I think I have it now . " Beatrice stood next to him and observed closely as he slipped the needle into Bonnie 's vein . His motion was certain and swift . Bonnie , looking away like she always did when she got her blood drawn , did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got all night , you know , " she said . <p> " Yeah , ' said Luke , biting his lip as he pushed a vacuum-filled test tube up into the plastic sheath that covered the bottom of the needle . Inside the sheath was the sharpened back end of the needle , and they could all hear a dull popping sound as it broke the vacuum in the tube . Beatrice watched , fascinated , as Bonnie 's living blood beat into the tube . She imagined herself in Bonnie 's place , imagined Luke 's sure fingers caressing the crook of her arm . She stood closer to him and pretended that the growing erection that shamed and disturbed him was inspired by her . He pulled out the needle and pressed a pad of gauze against the wound . <p> " You big smoothie ; ' said Bonnie . " I did n't even notice " <p> " That 's the idea , " said Luke . " Who wants to draw me ? " He hoped it would be Bonnie , but she was absorbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluorescent light from the ceiling and swirling the contents . <p> " I can never believe how red it is , " she said . <p> " Sit down , Luke , " said Otto . " I 'll take care of you . " <p> Otto put on a pair of extra-large gloves and proceeded to draw Luke 's blood . He used a new needle , but Luke almost wished Otto would use the same one he had used on Bonnie . That would be a certain type of closeness , he thought . <p> Olivia came up behind them with Denis just in time to observe the penetration . As she watched Otto execute a flawless phlebotomy procedure , she imagined him , with his swollen muscles and great strength , driving the needle straight through Luke 's arm and out the other side . <p> " You 're getting good at this , Otto , " she said , patting him on the back . She left her arm resting on the back of his shoulder and felt the subtle workings in the great muscle as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks , " he said . He drew her next , then Denis . It was something of a thrill to watch Denis roll up his sleeve and expose the vein that stood out in bold relief all the way down his arm . As he felt the vein under his thumb , he imagined his own heart beating in exact time with Denis 's , then had a vision of their two bodies , especially the chests , pressed up against each other , and both of them marveling at the synchronicity of their hearts as they held each other . <p> When he was finished , Otto sat down and tried to roll up his sleeve , but he could only get it as far as his upper forearm . Beyond that , his arm was too thick for the cuff , so he was forced to remove his shirt . Beatrice stood by Denis as he performed the draw , and admired the pattern of black hair that spread from Otto 's belly up his abdomen , over his chest , and under his arms . It looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive shampoo on it instead of soap . She wanted to touch it , so she did . <p> Olivia admired it , too , fiercely , and pictured her face against it , and even went so far as to position herself next to Otto to see if she could catch a scent from under his elevated arm . Bonnie found herself appreciative of the flat lines of Otto 's stomach , and the wide stretch of his chest , and especially the thick , wing-like extension of the muscles along his sides . Luke watched Bonnie watching Otto , and envied him . Denis thought solely of his jumping lady . <p> He thought of her lying in the OR , perhaps already opened up , and prayed silently that her operation would come off without any complications . Beatrice muttered a prayer of her own to thwart Denis 's : she prayed for a power outage or an incompetent anesthetist or that someone would drop the liver . <p> She waited a little longer in the lab , while Denis and Otto performed the analyses on all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were healthy . It turned out that Luke 's iron level could have been higher and that Bonnie 's glucose was dreadfully low . <p> " Time for lunch ! " Bonnie said when she learned this , and went to go find Denis to convince him to help her hunt down the traveling food cart . Luke watched her go , then picked up the phone because it was ringing . He listened with a grave expression , and said , " All right ; ' then hung up . He folded his arms across his chest and said to Olivia , who was busy entering results into the computer , " Transplant 's canceled . The jumping lady is dead . " Beatrice , upon hearing this , did not stay to see Olivia 's reaction , but made directly for the river . <p> She was severely disappointed when she realized that she still could not pass over the bridge . She puzzled over this the whole way back to the hospital . She wondered , Will I be stuck here forever ? She went looking for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . It was still in the SICU , though now in a different room . Outside she saw a team of doctors arguing with each other . " What am I supposed to do with this liver ? " one of them wanted to know . <p> Another doctor was interrogating Judy , who felt close to weeping with frustration . She repeated her story , that Beatrice had coded while she was brushing her hair . <p> " And who told you to go around brushing people on their hair ? " a doctor asked her . He was from Iran . Judy had never liked him . <p> " For God 's sake , I was trying to be nice ! " said Judy . " And if you do n't like that you can just fuck yourself right out of the profession ! " She turned and stormed away , damning the consequences of her outburst . As she ran out of the bay , Frank turned to a fellow nursing assistant and said , " The mouse roars . " Beatrice went and looked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body had experienced a spontaneous and universal shutdown of organ systems , but every other time somebody had revived it . Her body looked the same to Beatrice as it ever did , but she knew from the conversation around her that she was certifiably brain dead . Now machines gave her a semblance of life , keeping her unruined organs alive for transplant to someone else . <p> Beatrice turned away from her body and wandered out of the bay . It would be a while before they took her off the machine and began to remove her organs . There were blood tests to run , and the organ harvesting team would need to be roused from their beds . She went and found her liver , still waiting for her in the OR . It was the sole occupant of the room . She went and looked at it where it lay in a volume of pale pink fluid that was not blood . But the whole thing reeked so strongly of blood that she thought she might faint . " Be happy , liver , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathology lab because she wanted to spend her last hours at the hospital among friends . <p> Halfway back to the lab she heard music and followed it . It took her downstairs , through many different hallways , always sounding very close because the acoustics in this part of the hospital were strange . It was not unusual for a stray groan to come floating down the hall to disturb a candystriper on some innocuous mission . The music led her to the third-floor balcony over the atrium , where she looked down and saw Bonnie playing on the big piano while Denis sat glumly beside her . Bonnie played sprightly in a high octave and sang : <p> Fingers are fun , Toes are nice , Brains are soft And gray like mice But blood is best . <p> Yes blood is the best , Oh blood is the best , Even your mama will tell you That blood is the best because Blood is the sum of our parts . <p> She stopped singing but continued to play softly . " My mother the nurse taught me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . She-the housekeeper , not my mother-got fired for sipping clotted blood out of used specimen tubes . Said it tasted like oysters . " Bonnie was trying to amuse Denis because he was so sad . When she went back to ask him to lunch , he was just putting down his phone . He stood frozen over his machines for a moment , then burst violently into tears . For a moment Bonnie was uncertain what to do , but then she ran to him and threw her arms around him , saying , " It 's okay , Denis , " which was the first thing she could think of . <p> Denis did n't particularly want to be held . He hated Bonnie briefly , because she was alive and the jumping lady was dead , and if in that moment he could have traded one life for the other , he certainly would have . Bonnie held him , and he cried into her labcoated shoulder for a few minutes , then stood back from her . " I do n't know what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's been a long night , " she said , though it had n't , really . It had been almost relaxing , so far , because it was so slow . I 'm holding him ! she thought . What else matters ? <p> " It 's the jumping lady , " he said . " She 's dead . It 's sad . " <p> " I did n't know ! " Bonnie exclaimed . " I did n't know you knew her ! " <p> " I did n't , " he said . " It 's just sad , is all . " A fresh sob rose up from his belly and burst out of his mouth . <p> Bonnie looked over Denis 's shoulder and saw Luke staring at them from the hall . He turned and walked away . " Let 's get out of here for a minute , " she said , taking him by the hand and leading him out the back door . He did not protest , even as she led all the way to the piano , sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above them , while Bonnie moved her fingers over the lowest section of the keyboard and started a new song , Beatrice stepped off the balcony and began to float down . She managed a perfect landing on the piano , and sat down cross-legged on it , staring intently into the faces of Bonnie and Denis , who were not looking at each other . Bonnie stopped playing . <p> " Are you feeling better ? " <p> " Sure , " said Denis . " Thanks . It 's weird how it got to me like that : ' He did not plan ever to tell anyone that he had been in love with the jumping lady . <p> " I think it 's a good thing , " she said . " You 'd make a good doctor . " <p> " No thanks : ' A nearby elevator opened its doors , and a security guard emerged from it . He approached them warily . <p> " You 're not allowed to be playing that piano , " he said . <p> " Yeah , right ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chopsticks . " <p> " I 'm going to have to ask you to stop that . " <p> " If you want me to stop , you 're going to have to shoot me , " said Bonnie . <p> " Maybe we should be going , " said Denis . <p> " I 'm enjoying myself , " said Bonnie . " Is it a crime to enjoy yourself in a hospital ? Are people allowed only to suffer and die here ? " She began to play " Fir Elise . " The guard peered at their nametags and made notes in a small black book . <p> " We 're on our way , " said Denis , pulling at Bonnie 's arm . <p> " I 'll have to file an incident report " the guard said . <p> " File away ! " said Bonnie . She felt giddy . Perhaps it was the after-effect of having Denis in her arms , or of being next to him . <p> " I 'll see you up in the lab , " said Denis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked after him . <p> " Wait ! " she said . " Let 's go find the food cart . " The guard walked away , thinking of all the patients wanting their sleep . Beatrice remained on top of the piano . She lay on her back and looked up all the way to the top of the atrium , seven stories up . She saw people walking by occasionally , along the balconies , carrying blood to the lab or moving a patient . She saw the beautiful Filipino woman who worked in the dietary department wheeling the third-shift food cart along the balcony and eating a candy bar . She closed her eyes and imagined all her friends from the lab standing spread out on all the different levels and balconies while she herself floated above the piano . She imagined them calling out to each other : Olivia to Otto , Otto to Denis , Denis to her , she to Luke , Luke to Bonnie , and Bonnie to Denis . They were all shouting , " Please love me . " <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos . The respite they 'd been enjoying was over , and things were very busy again . She sat in the window and watched Luke as he rushed around , looking hapless . <p> He felt lost in a rush of fluid . They were getting tests now not just for blood but for urine , and CSF , and all manner of effusions . Nursing assistants came and dumped specimens in great quantities at the window . There were even small pieces of people coming up now , discreet bits of organ or tumor to be processed and frozen for a pathologist to look at in the morning . Someone dropped off a whole human brain in a Tupperware container full of formaldehyde . <p> And there was much stool , most of it quite runny , packaged in blue plastic containers that looked to Luke much like the containers in which delis packaged their potato salad . In the hurry to get things done , he dropped one . He was acutely grateful that it did n't break open on the floor . Instead it bounced and rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sorry , " he said . <p> " That 's okay . " Olivia suffered another moment of perversity in which she imagined picking up the container and throwing its soupy contents all over Luke , and all over the walls and windows of the lab , all the while shouting , " Shit ! Shit ! Shit ! " <p> " I 'm getting very tired , " she said . <p> " Tell me about it , " he said . Much time had passed , though Luke barely noticed . It was almost five . He could go home at six . They all could , but he was n't looking particularly forward to it . He wondered if one day he and Bonnie might leave together and go to his apartment . Otto wandered up from the chemistry lab . " Make it stop , " he said . " I do n't want to work anymore . " " I think it 's slowing down , " said Luke . " Where 's Bonnie ? " Otto asked , sitting down at one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Olivia . " With Denis . " It was a quality of her perpetually sweaty palms that they made a sucking sound when ground together and rapidly pulled apart . She made those sounds now , and winked . In fact Bonnie was only helping Denis do differential cell counts . He had forgiven her for causing a scene , and she had been so bold as to make plans with him for later in the day . <p> " I 'll be right back , " said Luke . He walked out of the lab , down the hall , and into the men 's bathroom . Beatrice followed right behind . She watched him at the urinal , craning her head around his side to get a glimpse of his penis . It was not very exciting , and she realized with a very mild sort of sadness that she did not really desire him physically . Rather , she dreamed of haunting him , of climbing unseen and unfelt into his single bed at night , of lying there on him and in him and by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the plaster had fallen down one night . He had woken with a start when it fell near the foot of the bed . <p> She leaned against the sink while he washed his face , then watched him stare into his own eyes in the mirror . Putting her face next to his , and staring where he stared , she could hear perfectly what he was thinking . It was , What 's wrong with me ? <p> When Luke and Beatrice left the bathroom , the phlebotomists were arriving . Luke continued back to the lab , but Beatrice stopped to watch them pass . Every morning she came up to watch the arrival . It was like a parade . They came down the hall in twos and threes , some with their arms around each other , some having recently left the same bed . Their names were Wendy , Elaine , Alan , Randy , Eric , Arthur , Liu , Louisa , Amanda , Loric , Oliver , Nathan , and Elizabeth . Beatrice thought they were all very pretty , especially Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was always pink and vibrant-looking from the cold when he arrived . He looked to Beatrice like the sort of boy who drank great quantities of milk . <p> She liked to smell them , because each one wore a different cologne or perfume . Some days she spent her whole morning following them around as they slipped in and out of patients ' rooms , drawing blood . But she would not do that today . <p> Today she waited patiently at the window and watched her friends as they finished up their work . She waited an hour before everyone was ready to go . It was customary for them all to go out to breakfast together . Otto suggested a pancake house . Everyone said that was a fine idea except Luke , who said he was too tired to eat , and started off down the hall . Beatrice did not follow him right away . She paused to watch her other friends walk off together in the opposite direction . She sent a prayer after them . <p> Let it happen this way , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as if that might make what she wanted for them so . Let it be that Olivia and Otto encounter in each other something lovely , and Denis and Bonnie inspire each other 's joy , and let something nice happen to Luke . <p> She knelt in an attitude of supplication and willed joy on her friends . In her mind 's eye she could see the future as she desired it to be : Denis and Bonnie kissing in the bitter cold inside her car while they waited for the engine to warm ; Otto and Olivia rubbing their feet together as they watched a movie in his apartment , and falling asleep with their heads touching and their breath on each other 's faces . But for Luke she could imagine nothing . <p> Beatrice hurried after him , catching up as he was walking down the hill towards the river and the bus stop . The hospital grounds were beautifully landscaped , complete with a small wood that extended to the river . Snow was everywhere on the ground and trees , and still falling thinly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisiana . He thought , on his way down the wooded hill , of his parents ' house on Lake Pontchartrain . An ambulance wailed by him , going to pick someone up . He began to cry , but stopped by the time he reached the bus stop . <p> There was a girl there , huddled in a big coat , reading by the light of the streetlamps . She gave him a sullen look and turned back to her magazine . Luke sat down as far from her as he could . Beatrice sat next to him and considered trying to hold his hand . Luke closed his eyes and thought , for no reason he could think of , of the hole in his ceiling . He had still not cleaned up the plaster . He heard laughter . <p> Opening his eyes , he saw a woman coming towards him . She was dressed in a black shirt and white pants , and looked to him as if she had been out dancing . Her makeup was smeared on her face . He noticed , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Excuse me ; " she said . " Pardon me . " She was no one he knew . <p> " Yes , " he said . He looked at her hair . It was all messy , but he could tell that it had at some recent time been elaborately styled . <p> " Can you help me ? " she asked . <p> " I do n't know , " he said . There was little concern in his voice . <p> " I 'm really bleeding , " she said . " I just got my period , and I 'm sort of without supplies . You know ? Do you have any ? " <p> " I think you should ask her , " he said , indicating the reading girl with his head . The girl raised her head and looked at them briefly , then ignored them . <p> " I did . No luck . Have you got some tissues ? A hankie ? Anything ? " <p> " Sorry , " said Luke . He wanted her to go away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I ca n't help you . " <p> " Well , " she said , touching her white pants , " am I spotting ? Can you at least tell me that ? I ca n't bend over enough to see . I think I 'd fall . I 'm not myself right now . " Luke met her eyes for a moment . They were blue . He looked down at her crotch . <p> The woman burst out laughing . Nearby a man was laughing , too . Luke saw him step out of a shadow . The woman went to him . She put her arm around him , and they began to stagger off . Luke looked at the girl with the magazine . She was smiling . He stood up and moved his hands from his jacket pockets to his pants pockets , looking away from her . His face was hot . There was something in his pocket . He took it out . <p> It was the blue-topped tube that Denis had been missing . Luke had sworn he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he remembered picking it up when Olivia forgot it on a counter . The blood in the tube was dark but not clotted . He held it in his bare hand . It was warm , from being next to his leg . With his thumb he worked the stopper free , then began to run after the woman and her friend . When he was close enough , he splattered it liberally over their necks and backs . The woman touched her hand to the back of her neck and brought it forward to look at it . When she saw the blood , she screamed loud enough to startle winter birds away from the telephone wires upon which they perched and sang . <p> " There ! " Luke shouted . " There ! " The man came forward and punched him square in the face . Luke fell down on the snowy sidewalk , where the man kicked him once in the head , then walked away with his friend , trying to console her . The magazine girl got up to wait for her bus at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke . He was staring unblinking up into the dawning sky . He felt strangely content , lying there , and she was worried for him . She felt overcome by something . When she saw him falling back with blood spraying from his nose , love swelled in her like a sponge so she felt heavy for the first time since she 'd awoken in the hospital . She reached out to him . Though he could feel it when she stroked his forehead , he thought it was just a breeze . When she bent down and kissed him , he thought it was a twitch in his lip , possibly the result of brain damage from the kick to his head . <p> As she kissed him she had a vision of becoming his spirit wife . In time , she knew now , he would come to feel her and see her and know her . It would be as if she were n't even dead . The kiss itself , the contact , was thrilling . How could I have left this ? she wondered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But even as she kissed him , a sharp , clear note sounded in her head , and she knew with exquisite certainty that they had at last harvested her heart from her chest . It was on its way now to someone who needed it and wanted it . With her heart 's disconnection , the veil obscuring her memory was lifted , and she recalled with perfect clarity the motivation for her leap . As the last quantities of blood drained from her heart , she stood up and threw out her arms , as if in benediction to the whole winter landscape . <p> Free at last ! She cried , and ran off across the street and over the bridge . Halfway across she took off , went up and away , in search of a place without loneliness and desire ; without rage , misery , and torture ; without disappointment ; without crushing , impenetrable sadness . <p>
