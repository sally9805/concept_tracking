The most stunning , overwhelming victory in war is a beginning as well as an end . Diplomatic problems will persist long after the burned-out hulks of Iraqi tanks and the bodies strewn across the cratered battlefield are buried by sand . Political dangers will explode after the last of thousands of mines are dug up . Psychological reverberations will be felt when the final echoes of cheers for the victors have died away . <P> Saddam Hussein remains in power , at least for the moment , shorn of the military might that made him a menace but not of all capacity for troublemaking . Containing him may require not only a long-lasting arms embargo but also some sort of regional security scheme . Kuwait is liberated , but a smoldering wreck needing perhaps years of reconstruction . Then come the broader difficulties : trying to forge a stable regional balance of power  --  or balance of weakness , as some commentators suggest  --  and defuse the hatreds that have made the Middle East the world 's most prolific breeding ground for war . French President Francois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be addressed : " The Arab-Israeli conflict , the Palestinian problem , the problem of Lebanon , the control of weapons sales , disarmament , redistribution of resources , reconstruction of countries hit by the war . " <P> The U.S. emerges with new power and credibility ; any pledge it makes to defend an ally or oppose an aggressor means far more than such a promise would have meant prior to Jan. 15 . But the U.S. also urgently needs to define George Bush 's vision of a new world order . To what extent is America ready to assume the role of world policeman ? More specifically , under what circumstances might it  --  and some of its allies  --  again mount a military effort comparable to the one in the gulf ? Certainly that can not be done in response to every case of aggression anywhere , but how does Washington pick and choose ? What kind of relationship can it forge with the Soviet Union , which gave crucial support to the anti-Saddam coalition but also served brief notice , in its efforts to mediate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests ? <P> Among Americans , the war has finally laid to rest all the ghosts of Vietnam . Self-doubt , deep divisions , suspicions of national decline  --  the very words suddenly seem quaint . The problem now may be to contain the surge of pride and unity before it bursts the bounds of reason and passes into jingoism , even hubris . <P> None of that , however , can detract from the awesome speed , power and totality of the allies ' military victory . The war , particularly its climactic 100-hour campaign , bids fair to be enshrined in military textbooks for as long as the annihilation of a Roman army by Hannibal at the battle of Can nae in 216 B.C. That is still a model for a strategy of encirclement , like the one followed by General H. Norman Schwarzkopf , the allied commander in the gulf .
