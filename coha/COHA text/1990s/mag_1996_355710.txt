Washington thought it was done with gay issues for this year . Congress had passed the Defense of Marriage Act , which allowed states to ban same-sex marriage , and the Senate narrowly defeated a bill to ban antigay job discrimination . But gay politics of a different kind have come back to haunt Republicans and Democrats alike . In recent weeks some Republicans have found that the issue of sexual orientation  --  specifically their own  --  has re-entered the campaign . And Democrats are being accused of raising the issue to play to homophobic voters , even while their party presents itself as sympathetic to gay rights . <P> One such case is in Columbus , Ohio . For almost 14 years it had passed without comment that the local Congressman , John Kasich , the powerful chairman of the House Budget Committee , stretches his paycheck by sharing a Virginia town house for the two or three nights a week that Congress is in session . His housemate ? His male chief of staff . Last month Cynthia Ruccia , Kasich 's Democratic challenger , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a serious appearance of impropriety " because Kasich , who is divorced , lived with someone whose government salary he controls . <P> That was the official question . What it unofficially implied was that the two men might be otherwise involved . Though Ruccia denies that she intended to leave that impression , Kasich 's office inevitably found itself having to deny that either man is gay . No federal investigation is likely . ( To begin with , the Justice Department does not examine " appearances . ' ' ) As it happens , Ruccia had long been a high-profile supporter of gay rights and Kasich an occasional ally at best . ( He voted yes on AIDS funding , no on gay marriage . ) But by raising the issue , she stands to benefit from whatever doubt she creates in the minds of voters hostile to gays . <P> Even Democrats were crying foul . " It was the worst sort of gutter politics and gay baiting , " says Bob Fitrakis , Kasich 's 1992 Democratic opponent . And the gay community in Kasich 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's disappointing to see it from a party that has been the most progressive on the issues , " says Phil Martin , president of Stonewall Union , Ohio 's largest gay-rights organization , which counts Ruccia as a member . <P> South Dakota is the scene of another such case , bizarre in its own way . Last week Republican Senator Larry Pressler spent the opening minutes of his debate with Democratic challenger Tim Johnson insisting that " some of the things that have been said in the campaign in the last two weeks of a personal nature are despicable and totally false . " Pressler did n't spell out what those were , but most South Dakotans would have known . In September , former Senator James Abourezk , a Democrat , had arranged for Alexander Cockburn , a columnist for the left-leaning weekly Nation , to make several appearances around the state . Why ? In his 1996 book Washington Babylon , Cockburn asserts that Pressler had hastily married " amid speculation that he was gay . " The only source cited by Cockburn and co-author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who entertained clients at the Capitol Hill apartment of Massachusetts Representative Barney Frank , though without Frank 's knowledge .
