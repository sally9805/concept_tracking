txt Il II ROLE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT scheduled services ) are handled largely by the current and former public sector urban , and regional , operators , while the independent sector has predominated in the " other " market , as discussed in Chapter 1 . The latter totals around 600 million trips per annum , largely composed of school and works services . The express service category - based on the Transport Act 1985 definition of those carrying all their passengers a distance of at least 15 miles measured in a straight line - is a fairly small one , around 15 million trips . In practice , many long-distance and commuter coach services also carry intermediate traffic , and are therefore registered in the local service category . Total passenger-km for the whole bus and coach industry are shown in Table 2.1 . Estimates for specific sec-tors or operators are not available , except for London Transport , which recorded a total of ' 3,900 million passenger-kin in 1992/3. ) n MEASURES OF USE Within this chapter , attention will now be focused on local movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated separately in Chapter 8 and long-distance in Chapter 9 . Measures of use At this point it is important to define more precisely the measures of use that are available , and the dangers of bias in their composition . Passenger trip The simple term " passenger trip " appears unambiguous , but is subject to distortion , especially in large urban areas . From the passenger 's point of view , a trip Consists of movement from one activity to another , such as home to work . This typically consists of several links , e.g. walk to bus , ride in bus , and walk to final destination ( implications of this for journey time are considered in Ch. 5 ) . Within the National Travel Survey ( NTS ) , the term " journey " is used for a trip from one activity to another , and " stage " for each transport mode used ( where use is made of the same mode more than once in succession within the same Stage , e.g. use of two buses , the stage may be divided into " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as used in the NTS is not the same as the " stage " concept In setting fare scales ( see Ch. 7 ) . Most bus operators simply count as a passenger trip each ride in one of their vehicles , this being the definition implicitly adopted for bus services in Table 2 . I . Where only one vehicular ride is involved , as in most small towns and rural areas , the distortion is not serious ( except insofar as the non-motorized links are concerned ) , but in larger cities , with their more extensive networks , more than one pride in a public transport vehicle may be needed to reach the destination activity . liven in all-bus systems , some interchange occurs as a result of a through Service not being available ( or passengers reducing travel time by taking the first bus to arrive and interchanging where necessary , rather than waiting for a less frequent through service ) and where integrated bus/rail systems are operated , a vrty large difference may exist between totals for unlinked trips ( i.e. rides in each vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public transport trip is counted , even if two or more rides are involved ) . A good example may be found in the Tyne and Wear system , where the introduction of an integrated bus/metro network made it necessary to monitor carefully the extent of such trips . In 1983 4 , a total of 371.4 million passenger hoardings took place Ion all public transport modes , including buses , ferries and the Metro ) . These cottesponded to 31 1 . I million linked passenger trips ( a ratio of I : I .19 ) . For the 21 1111 8011 c l I I iltllc IRANSPORI Metro in particular , linked trips were very important : of the 49.5 million passenger boardings in that year , only 13.8 million ( or 28% ) consisted simply of a metro ride ( with walk links ) , all the others being linked trips which also involved use of bus , ferry , etc . Most bus operators traditionally issued a separate ticket each time a passenger boarded a bus , the number of tickets sold thus being equated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as travelcards , annual statistics are usually based on the number of passenger boardings . Several sources of bias exist in bus operators ' estimates , even on this basis . With the spread of electronic ticketing systems ( A 's ) , this problem is now much less serious , but distortions arise in historic data series , which may have overstated past years ' totals , leading to exaggeration of the decline in bus use . Changes in network structure may also affect the ratio of linked to unlinked trips . For example , in 1977 , the chain ferry across the River Itchen at Southampton was replaced by a bridge , over which through-bus services were operated , instead of terminating at either side . As only one ticket would be needed for the through journey , an improvement in service produced an apparent decline in passenger numbers . Where season tickets , travelcards or concessionary passes are in use , a separate record is not normally made of each trip . Estimates of total use may be made by multiplying the number on issue by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from continuous on-vehicle surveys , as currently used for estimating pensioner concessionary travel in London . A shift to contactless smart-card format for travelcards will enable data on boardings to be collected automatically as tickets are validated . Estimates of trips per holder may need periodic adjustment in the light of changing market penetration , reduction in the number of working days per year , and so on . On railways and long-distance coaches , through tickets to the final destination have generally been issued , at any rate within the network of the same operator ( double-counting thus occurs between London Underground and BR services in London ) , making the unlinked/linked trip distinction less critical . However , the high proportion of season or travelcard use on rail makes accurate assessment of trip rates by their holders especially important . The traditional British Rail ticket issuing system based on sale at stations , with destination station named on the ticket , makes derivation of a station-to-station matrix from ticket sales data possible , subject to some qualifications . This is now provided by CAPRI ( Computer Analysis of Passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( National Passenger Analysis and Accounting System ) . Passenger-kilometres Passenger kilometres ( passenger-km ) may he defined as the total distance travelled ( or paid for ) by users . They may he derived from an estimate of trips ( sub- // ject to bias as discussed previously ) multiplied by the average length of trip , or an estimate of average vehicle occupancy , multiplied by estimated total vehiclekm , the latter being the basis of national totals for road transport in Table 2.1 . On railways , station-to-station ticket sales have enabled estimates to be made for many years . On buses , the ticketing system is less suitable for this purpose , but , where a finely graduated fare scale is applied , the number of fare stages paid for can be estimated , or estimates can be made from passenger surveys of average trip length . In many respects , passenger-km is a better measure of the use made of public transport , in that bias attributable to the definition of trip may be avoided , and a meaningful estimate made of vehicle occupancy by dividing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the same as the " passengers boarding per km " figure obtained by dividing passenger trips by vehicle-km . For example , if a bus runs 50km , and is boarded by 100 passengers , with an average trip length of 4 km , then total passenger-km travelled will be 400 ( 4 x 100 ) , and average occupancy 8 ( 400/50 ) , whereas passengers boarding per km is 2 ( 100 divided by 50 ) . This distortion becomes greater as trip length increases . The " passengers boarding per km " indicator is particularly inappropriate as a means of comparing use of routes within the same network , between which average trip length may differ substantially . However , it may be of value in comparing trends over time ( for example , in average bus occupancy since deregulation ) , in the absence of any specific evidence in respect of change in average trip length . Revenue Revenue may also be used as a indicator of usage . Apart from its obvious financial importance , it may also act as a proxy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay substantially higher fares than on buses , which reflect the speed and convenience offered . In the intercity market , first-class fares likewise represent higher product quality . User spending may also be measured nationally as a means of indicating the different sums spent on each mode . If subsidies to operators are added , and the transfer element of taxes paid deducted , these then become estimates of resources used . Clearly , the money that users are willing to pay indicates the minimal valuation of the service they obtain . However , it does not indicate the consumer surplus and , for relatively inelastic markets in particular , this may be very large . An operator may increase total revenue through raising fares , but this would not be a good indication of utility obtained ( for a given quality of product ) , since not only would those who had ceased to travel lose the benefit from so doing , but consumer surplus of remaining users would he reduced . Given that urban and short distance travel is generally inelastic , the revenue measure is thus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE ROLE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT Major characteristics of the urban and short-distance market Sources of data In addition to data from the operators themselves , several other sources enable a fairly comprehensive picture to be built up . The ten-yearly Census , the latest in 1991 , gives estimates of household car availability and , for a 10% sample , the mode of travel between home and workplace . It can also give a zonal population base for trip rate estimates using operators ' data , as shown below . Comprehensive Land Use Transportation Studies ( LUTS ) were carried out in many towns and cities from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s . These typically provide a great deal of household survey data on the use of all motorized modes , which enable the public transport share to be estimated for specific markets . I lowever , few have been repeated ( the only significant case being the Greater London " transportation Survey ( GLTS ) in 1962 , 1971 , and 1981 , and its successor , the London Area Transport Survey ( LATS ) in 1991 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns relatively recently , for example Hemel Hempstead . Hence they may be used for cross-sectional comparisons , but rarely for trends over time . In addition , a new generation of " integrated transport studies " ( ITS ) has appeared , pioneered by that in Birmingham . These follow an approach broadly similar to that of the LUTS , but with a greater emphasis on testing major policy options , and less on construction of the very detailed zone-to-zone trip matrices characteristic of the earlier studies ( May 1991 ) . Surveys by operators themselves for network planning methods such as MAP , vIPS and BODS ( see Ch. 5 ) provide data similar to LUTS , but normally within the public transport mode only , and not indicating market share . MAP studies covered many of the rural areas and smaller towns during the late 1970s , with more recent and continuing urban studies . Other operator surveys amplify the picture : for example , London Transport 's annual cordon count of all modes for peak travel into the central area , and its trip diaries compiled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been adopted in some areas as a means of monitoring changes over time , through a panel of respondents , notably in London and South Yorkshire . They are particularly useful for assessing the rates of turnover in the market . The panel is composed of the same individuals , who are repeatedly contacted , so that a picture is obtained of how , and perhaps why , individuals change their travel patterns over a given period . The National Travel Survey ( NTS ) is the most comprehensive source , although care has to be taken in applying it to specific zones , owing to the small sample size in any one area . It has been conducted on six occasions since 1965-6 , the latest in 1989-91 . Use is made of this below to analyze market structure , with some additional data drawn from the previous ( 1985/86 ) survey . All modes are covered , with increasingly comprehensive coverage of non motorized modes in the recent surveys . ) A MAJOR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE URBAN AND SHORT-DISTANCE MARKET The General Household Survey ( GHS ) provides some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NTS , especially car and bus use among the population as a whole , and distribution of household expenditure . The Family Expenditure Survey ( FES ) , whose primary role is in calibration of the Retail Price Index ( RPI ) , provides a further source in terms of household spend-ing on transport . the journey to work Tables 2.2 and 2.3 show the shares of the journey-to-work market by different modes , from the 1991 census and 1989-91 NTS . Note that the principal mode of transport used is shown - for example , if someone commutes to central London by British Rail , and then makes a shorter ride on the Underground to reach their final destination , only British Rail will be shown as the mode used . Overall , buses account for about 10% of all journeys to work , and rail about 5% ( or , as shares of the motorised market , about 13% and 6% respectively ) . As one would expect , the public transport mode share is greater for central London , I with 59% of journeys to work by BR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these figures arc for the whole day : during the morning peak ( 0700-1000 ) , the rail share is substantially greater at about 74% . Elsewhere , the rail share is jcnerally small , and varies substantially between different parts of outer London ' 17 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT ( Croydon is well served , for example ) and between the conurbation centres . The greatest shares handled by bus and coach are for outer London ( 13% ) and con-urbation centres ( 22% ) . Note that over five times as many car commuters trav-elled as drivers than passengers , giving an average car occupancy for this purpose of only 1.2 . Other journey purposes Although public transport 's role tends to be associated mainly with the work journey , it is evident that this is not necessarily where bus takes the greatest share . As fable 2.4 shows , local bus took 9% of all trips in 1989-91 , a figure virtually identical to its share in the journey-to-work market ( Table 2.2 ) . Of the shopping/personal business market , bus took 16% . The largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , at 19% , ( and it is likely that a good deal of the l8 % " other " for this journey purpose is by contract school bus ) which varies little with size of area served . This in turn comprises mainly trips to and from school , plus an important further and higher education market in some areas . As many school trips are above walking distance , a major demand for public transport is created , especially in rural areas , as discussed further in Chapter 8 . The role of rail is generally small for non-work purposes , so that estimates are often unreliable . Car occupancy levels are often much higher for non-work purposes - averag-ing 2.0 for leisure , and 1.6 for shopping . Hence for these purposes , perceived cost per person by public transport may compare unfavorably where car run-ning and parking costs are split . The proportion of public transport trips - both for all purposes , and work - falls gradually with size of urban area , associated with absence of rail services , lower levels of bus service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These factors are considered further below . MAJOR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE URBAN AND SHORT-DISTANCE MARKET It will be noted that the proportions of motorized trips by mode quoted from the NTS in Table 2.3 differ considerably from the proportions of passenger-km in ' Fable 2.1 , bus taking 10% of all motorised trips ( and if school contract and long-distance services were included , somewhat more ) but only 6% of passen-ger-km ? a reflection of its very short average trip length , below that by car . For rail , the respective proportions were 2.5% and 6% , giving the opposite outcome . We can also divide the market served by each mode according to journey pur-pose , as shown in Table 2.5 . For local bus , shopping represents the single most important journey purpose , some 33% of all trips , whereas rail is clearly domi-nated by work ( 46% ) . In comparison with the all modes average , public trans-port is less strongly associated with the leisure market and personal business travel , as would be expected . If work and education trips are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32% of all bus journeys , and 51% of all rail journeys , compared with 25% for the all modes average . Hence , demand by time of day is much more sharply peaked for rail travel . The total number of taxis and private hire cars has grown rapidly in recent years , associated with legislative changes ( Ch. 1 ) , and increasing unemployment stim-ulating more entry into the trade . Licensed taxis as such grew from 32,700 in I985 to 48,300 in 1991 , by 48% ( TSGB93 , Table 5.9 ) . Use of taxis and private hire vehicles grew by a very similar 55% between 1985/6 and 1989/91 ( NTS Table 5 . I ) . While representing only 11% of all public transport journeys in 1989/9 1 ( and hence just over 1% of all motorised trips ) , they accounted for about 23% of all personal expenditure on public transport , due to the very much higher cost per trip . In some respects , the rules of ' taxis/private hire vehicles and other public transport could he seen as complementary : they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I985 may have been associated with reduced quality of bus services since deregulation . However , London displays 7 7 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT both a high level of conventional ( bus and rail ) public transport use , and the highest taxi/minicab mileage per person per year within Britain ( NTS , Table 5.8 ) . Variations by time of day , and day of week The internal structure of the public transport market may also be examined in terms of trip length distribution , and split by time of day and day of week . Within the Monday to Friday working day , work and education trips tend to be concentrated at peak periods ( around 0800-0930 , and 1600-1730 ) . However , they do not usually coincide in both peaks , since the school day is generally shorter than the adult working day . Where service industry employment predominates , working hours are typically around 0900-1700 , causing the morning school and work peaks to coincide , but with a spread in the late afternoon , as schools finish around 1530-1600 . Conversely , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 0730-0800 , it is the afternoon peak which coincides , around 1600 . The pattern is often a regional one , with older towns in Wales , Scotland and northern England displaying the latter pattern . Figure 2.1 shows the pattern of bus demand in London in 1992 - the effect of the higher morning peak is clear . In considering the economics of peak operation - discussed further in Chapter 6 - one thus has to bear in mind that some vehicles may perform only one loaded trip per day . In many areas , it is the school peak which causes almost the entire additional peak vehicle demand above a base level from 0800 to 1800 . This is evident in almost all smaller towns , and in most cities up to about 200,000 population , such as Plymouth and Southampton . Although journeys to work by public transport are substantial , they do not necessarily require more vehicular capacity ( given the higher load factors accepted in the peak ) than for shopping , and other trips between the peaks . Even in the largest conurbation bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central area that journeys to work create sharp peaks , school travel causing the peak within suburban areas . Rail networks display a very different peaking ratio , however , being oriented almost entirely to the centres of large cities , and thus the adult work journey . For example , in the West Midlands in 1984-85 , 62% of the passenger trips on the rail network on Mondays to Fridays occurred in the peak periods ( start of day to 0929 , and 1530 to 1759 ) , compared with 45% of bus trips . In London , this contrast is also marked . The Greater London Travel Survey of 1981 showed that 53 % of the passenger trips on the underground on Mondays to Fridays by Greater London residents were for work purposes , and hence highly peaked , compared with 29% of the trips on the bus network . Within large conurbations , the ratio of peak to base demand may be somewhat greater in terms of passenger-km than passenger trips , since the journeys to work in the centre are much longer than local shopping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 91 NTS shows that for all modes , work trips I I Il RO I OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT in towns of about 50,000 to 150,000 people , such as Oxford , or Grimsby . Many work trips are by car , and much school travel within walking or cycling distance . Shopping is fairly concentrated in town centres , generating good levels of demand on radial networks . In recent years , a similar flattening out of the public transport demand ratio between peak and inter-peak periods ( the latter being the shopping hours from about 0930 to 1600 ) has been observed , as work trips have shifted to the private car , or , more recently , declined owing to rising unemployment . The inter-peak demand has often held up better , owing to the rising proportion of pensioners in the population , often without cars , whose use of public transport is further encouraged by concessionary fares at such times . The availability of cars within the car-owning household during this period is also limited by the use of cars for the work trip , creating a potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , perhaps stimulated by lower off-peak fares . The growth of high-frequency minibus services has also stimulated non-work travel to a greater extent than peak demand , aiding this process . In the West Midlands , for example , the proportion of peak period trips ( defined as above ) fell from 50% of the Monday to Friday total in 1978-79 , to 45% in 1984-85 , while the inter-peak demand grew from 36% to 42% , also rising in absolute terms . This flattening out , while occurring within an overall decline , has thus enabled some improvement in vehicle and crew utilization through more efficient scheduling , whose cost implications are considered in Chapter 6 . A sharper decline has occurred in early morning , evening and Sunday travel , car availability to the household as a whole being much greater in the last two periods , and the first affected by loss of work journeys and changes in working hours . Evening travel has also been hit by the long-term drop in cinema attendance ( albeit recently reversed ) , and a reluctance in some areas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , very late evening and all-night bus travel has grown in London following the revamped network introduced during the 1980s . Since deregulation of local bus services outside London , it has been common to find that a Monday-Saturday service is registered to run commercially from about 0800 to 1800 ( even in some low-density areas ) , while early morning , evening and Sunday services become the responsibility of local authority tendered operations . Operators may also be unwilling to register additional peakperiod journeys required largely for school travel . Within the week as a whole , Mondays to Fridays display similar demand patterns , although Friday is often busier for shopping , and has an earlier afternoon peak , especially where the working week has been shortened by shorter hours on this day . In long-distance travel , a marked peak occurs on Friday evening , for weekend trips . Saturday continues to be a busy day for shopping trips , especially where car ownership is low , but has suffered a marked decline in high car-ownership areas , owing to use of the car by the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conurbations , the shopping activity is often concentrated in the secondary centres . Thus central Manchester is relatively quiet , while heavy traffic is carried to shopping centres in Stockport , Bolton , and other surrounding towns . Where such centres are located in well established towns , then good bus access is normally provided . For example , in 1987 some 46% of all shopping trips into central Bolton were by bus . However , the role of rail is much weaker . The main contrast is between shopping activity located within existing urban centres , and that at " out of town " locations , usually dependent on car access . Trip chaining Patterns of travel during the day may be best understood in terms of trip chains . Just as individual journeys are better analyzed as linked trips from one activity to another , the day 's travel can be seen as a chain of such links , starting at home , then via various activities and destinations until home is reached again . The simplest consists of " home ? one activity ( for example , work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found , such as returning home for lunch ( mainly in smaller towns ) , or returning in the evening via the shops , or place of entertain/ ment . Analysis of travel diaries from the 1985/86 NTS enables us to understand such chains more clearly ( White et al . 1991 ) . In analysing such data , short walk links must also be considered . For example , someone working in a city centre might walk to a shopping street open in the evening , then return home by public transport : although only two public transport journeys would be recorded , the trip chain is nonetheless a complex one in terms of individual behaviour . Complex public transport-based trip chains are found mainly in larger cities , often associated with the use of tickets such as the travelcard which permit additional linking trips at zero money cost . Trip chain analysis also enables us to understand how trips made by the same individual are linked by time of day ? for example , a substantial proportion ( around 40% ) of one-way trips made on bus services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chains which began earlier in the same day , rather than new home-based trips . Hence , cutting out a poorly loaded evening service has implications for ridership on daytime services , should the inability to make the return leg of the trip result in the user switching to another mode for the whole trip chain . This has implications for the extent to which evening services are in fact cross-subsidized by profitable daytime operation ( see Ch. 7 ) . The more complex chains may explain why cars are used sometimes for the peak work journey into large cities even when public transport may appear more convenient , as the car is available for indirect homeward journeys in the evenings , or business trips during the day . To capture a high share of the work mar- // ket , public transport may need to offer good evening services , and facilities such as travelcards which permit complex trip patterns without financial penalty or the inconvenience of checking fares for occasional journeys . Trip length distribution Having examined variations in trips by time , their distribution by length may now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides useful illustrations . However , it should be borne in mind that most NTS data ( as quoted earlier in this chapter , for example ) excludes very short trips ( those under one mile , or 1.6km , largely made on foot ) . The effect of including all journeys ( defined as links between activities ) is shown in Table 2.6 . The analysis of trip chaining described above is also sensitive to this difference in definition , where such short links are critical to the categorisation of chains as complex or simple . Table 2.6 shows the distribution for all purposes , by all modes ( including non-motorized ) . A sharp fall in trip frequency as length rises can be seen , as one would expect from the gravity model ( i.e. trip rate is inversely proportional to square of distance ) . Note that this distribution only follows a consistent trend if the non-motorized trips are included , since motorized trips peak at about 2 ? 3 km . Shopping and education trips tend to be shorter than average , and hence associ-ated particularly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributions in Figure 2.2 reflect those of all journey lengths shown in Table 2.6 , with a modal average of about 2 ? 3km . Rail trips , oriented to work in the central area , have much higher mean length of 10km . Trip length distribu-tions tend to vary by passenger type , with a marked skew to shorter trips by pen-sioners , but a less peaked pattern for travelcard use , associated with the journey to work . THE ROLE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT Hence , there is a substantial overlap between bus and non-motorised modes for shorter journeys , which may be more sensitive than bus travel as a whole to cost and time factors . Variations by type of person So far , this analysis has concentrated mainly on types of trip , but a fuller understanding requires the individual traveller to be considered . Table 2.7 shows some variations in frequency of bus and rail use by sex and age in 1989/91 . Table 2.7 Variations in bus and rail use by age , sex and household car ownership ; journey stages per person per year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest among the youngest and oldest groups , associated mainly with car availability . Young adults and those still in education are the most dependent , averaging 80 to 130 stages per person per year . Among the oldest groups , there is also high bus dependence , although the most common frequency of use is about 80 stages per year ( i.e. about two trips per week ) , asso-ciated with shopping and personal business , rather than work or education trips . Among the middle-aged , especially males , bus use is relatively low , owing to greater car availability . However , many females use the bus 2 ? 4 days per week , typically for shopping . Rail use follows a very different pattern . Whereas bus use is associated mainly with living in low-income households and with limited car availability , rail use , especially of British Rail services , is associated with higher-income households . There is also a correlation with regional income levels , bus use being highest in the older industrial conurbations , while rail use is concentrated in London and the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest quintile of households ( i.e. the bottom 20% ) defined by income made 113 bus journeys per year , but for the highest quintile this figure was only 35 . In terms of rail use , persons in the lowest quintile made 7 journeys a year , hut those in the highest made 41 ( NTS 1989/91 , " Fable 4.2 ) . This difference by social class and income IA TRIP RATES PER PERSON PER YEAR is also reflected in the political and media attention devoted to rail matters , as compared with bus issues . Differences between those in car-owning and non-carowning households are much less marked in the case of rail use than local bus travel . Amongst pensioners , bus use is relatively high in the age range 60-75 , but falls thereafter as greater difficulty is experienced in using any mode of transport . This is associated largely with getting on and off the vehicle : implications for vehicle design are considered in Chapter 3 . I rip rates per person per year The NTS provides overall estimates of trip rates per person per year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average about 1090 journeys per year ( if all lengths are included ) , or 771 journeys if only those over 1.6km are included . For public transport use as such the national average journey stages per person per year was 80 by all types of bus and coach service , 22 by rail ( all operators ) , and 13 by taxi ( Table 5.2 ) , a total of 115 trips , or slightly over two per week . These rates vary substantially by area of residence , with London residents averaging about 114 local bus , 98 rail and 16 taxi/private hire car stages , a total of about 230 stages per year ( from Tables 4.8 , 4.12 and 5.7 ) . On the same basis , those in the English metropolitan areas averaged about 127 bus , 10 rail and 13 by taxi , a total of 150 per year . South East England excluding London displays a low overall public transport use but within this , a marked tendency toward use of rail ( 37 local bus , 30 rail and 9 taxi , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other parts of England , but with a greater stress on bus use . Data from operators may also be used to estimate average trip rates per person , and to some extent by person type . These permit more detailed local comparisons to be made within Britain than the NTS sample permits , and for international comparisons to be readily produced . However , the absolute figures are usually based on rides recorded by the operator , which will give a higher figure than the stages recorded in NTS , especially in large cities where more interchange between routes and modes arises . Trips by non-residents may also increase the total vis a vis estimates produced for residents only - these include frequent trips by residents of other areas ( for example a British Rail commuter into London who uses the Underground for the last leg of their trip ) , and business or tourist visits by residents of other parts of the same country , or by foreigners . Local estimates , updated annually , may be produced , as long as operators disclose their data and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ census data ( annual updating may he accomplished by using the intermediate population estimates from OPc 's ) . On this basis . the average trip rate tin London Transport ( bus and Under-.15 THE ROLE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT ground ) was about 285 in 1992/3 - adding around 40 for trips on BR services gives an overall public transport trip rate of about 325 ( excluding taxis ) . The BR estimate is based on the fact that about 240 million trips per year were made on NSE services within London , of the 500 million per year total on NSE . In the West Midlands in 1978-79 , an average public transport ( bus and rail ) unlinked trip rate of 207 per head was observed . This ranged from 94 for those under 16 , to 231 for pensioners and 223 for working-age adults . These are , of course , crude averages , and within each market a gearing may be observed ( i.e. proportion of all trips accounted for by a certain proportion of individuals ) . For example , in the working age adult category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some 15% of the working-age population thus accounting for about half of all the public transport boardings by that category . A fairly high gearing in the under 16 market may also be found , associated with those school children who use public transport every school day , but it is lower within the working-age users ( for trips other than journey to work ) , and pensioner , sectors . In terms of international comparisons , the overall average trip rate per head by public transport is similar in Britain to that in other European countries . London 's 325 is comparable with that in Paris and other large cities . In smaller towns , the rate may even compare favourably where high-frequency minibuses have been successfully introduced . However , in the metropolitan conurbations ( which correspond to the largest cities in most other European countries , excluding Paris ) the current average of about 150 compares poorly with cases such as Amsterdam ( 320 ) , Munich ( 300 ) , Vienna ( 397 ) , Hannover ( 230 ) and especially with Zurich ( 470 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones 1994 ) . A striking feature is the dependence on bus services in such British conurbations , compared with the major role of rail systems offering higher quality services in the other European cities of similar size . Time spent in travel Irrespective of income , status or modes used all individuals ultimately face the same constraint in terms of time - 24 hours per day . Allowing for time spent in work , sleeping and household activities , the discretionary time in which travel and other activities may be fitted is fairly limited , especially within the MondayFriday working week . Although the amount of time spent by individuals in travel obviously varies , the average time spent in travel per person per day is surprisingly constant . Increased travel may thus be seen as arising from faster modes being used within the same time budget to cover greater distances . For example , the 1989/91 NTS shows that average distance per person per year , compared with that in 1975/6 , rose by 37% ( for all nudes ) , while average speed rose by 19% hence ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ovcr the same CHANGES IN INDIVIDUALS ' TRAVEL OVER TIME period journeys per person per year rose by 17% . Hence , the main change was in travelling greater distances rather than making more journeys . A more detailed time-activity diary enables such trends to be examined in greater depth . Work by Brog ( 1993 ) in German cities indicates that for intraurban travel the average time spent per person per day is very stable ( at about 60 minutes ) , as is the number of activities outside the home . For example , in comparing surveys carried out in Essen and Hannover in 1976 and 1990 it was found that average travel time per person in Essen had changed from 60 minutes to 59 minutes , and in Hannover from 61 to 62 . Activities per person per day likewise changed very little ( stable at 2.7 , and from 2.9 to 2.8 respectively ) . One could see thus the urban transport market as a whole as a saturated market , with little scope for dramatic expansion . More substantial changes were seen in the mix of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from non-motorised modes to car driver and public transport ) . However , in Hannover in particular , public transport did not decline as a share of total trips , but rose from 16 to 22% over this period . Such time budget constraints are less likely to apply to weekend , leisure and long-distance travel . Changes in individuals ' travel over time So far , although we have disaggregated the market into certain categories of person , we have not looked at individual behaviour . Individuals shift from one category to another , not simply as their ages change , but also their status ? from child to student , to adult , to married person possibly with children , to pensioner , etc . These stages in the life-cycle are associated with changes in household size and structure , car availability and in trip purpose . Thus the work journey is a major factor determining household travel behaviour for certain stages , the need to get children to school at others . Changes in travel behaviour are often associated with critical events in the life cycle , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many people may change their mode of travel for this reason , at least in the short run , rather than because of modal characteristics as such . This leads to a high turnover in the market , such that net changes between one year and the next are often small compared with the gross changes that produce them . For example , panel surveys in Tyne and Wear showed that a net reduction in the public transport share for the journey to work of 2 percentage points between 1982 and 1983 was the net result of 7% of respondents ceasing to he public transport users , while 5% became new users in that period . A net change of 2% thus involved about 12% of the sample in changing modes ( Smart I984 ) . These changes are likely to be particularly noticeable if an individual service is examined , since people may change routes used when changing homes acid/or THE ROLE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT jobs , while remaining in the public transport market . Even in a zone of apparently stable land use and total population , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurring . On a typical urban bus or rail route , as many as 20% of users may have begun to use that specific service within the last 12 months . Hence , if examining the impact of a recent change ( such as conversion to high-frequency minibuses ) it is important to distinguish users who have switched to a route for such personal reasons , as distinct from those attracted by service characteristics as such . Patterns of individual behaviour may influence trip frequencies over a very long period . For example , based on work in South Yorkshire and elsewhere , Goodwin and others have suggested that trip rates developed in early adult life may strongly influence subsequent modal use . The implication of this for transport operators and planners is that responses to changes in fares and service quality should be assessed not only in the shortrun , but over long periods , since much short run change is caused primarily by non-transport factors , but in the long run transport characteristics will affect other choices . For example , individuals may be firmly committed to a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which may not be affected even by large changes in price or service quality , but when relocating , will have to re-consider the routing , and perhaps mode , of that trip . If a good public transport service is offered , then re-location may take account of access by that mode ; if not , then car might be the inevitable choice . However , public transport operators currently tend to take a very short-run view of the market , given financial constraints , and the philosophy behind the deregulation of local bus services . Hence , the short-run impact of a fares increase ( which almost invariably raises total revenue ) is likely to be basis for decision-making , rather than the greater sensitivity to price changes which exists in the longer run ( this aspect is discussed further in Ch. 7 ) . Public transport and car use As car ownership has grown , it has had a direct effect on public transport use . First , the individual having first choice in use of the car ( usually corresponding to the main driver in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tend to use it , unless other specific factors apply ( such as commuting into a large city centre , for which public transport may be more convenient ) . His or her trips will then be lost to public transport , except for occasional journeys . In addition , however , other members of the household may also transfer some of their trips to the car , as passengers - a child being given a lift to school , or the family travelling together at weekends . The loss of trips to public transport will thus be greater than those of one person alone , although this could depend upon price and quality of the service offered : if ' it is good , then other nrcmhcis of the house-iu THE EFFECT OF UNEMPLOYMENT hold may be less inclined to arrange their trips so as to travel as passengers in the household car . Teenagers , for example , may prefer the greater independence of travel by public transport to being given lifts by their parents ( and the latter appreciate the reduction in chauffeuring ) . Overall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200-300 per annum ( see Table 2.7 for changes in individual trip rates ) . The effect is greater for the first car than the second , since the latter will be used in part to take trips that were being made as car passengers in the first ( the children acquiring their first cars , for example ) . The effect on public transport use is that the members of a one-car household still make substantial numbers of public transport trips , although these are concentrated into categories such as school and Monday-Friday shopping trips , with much less evening and weekend public transport use . A two-car household may make very little use of public transport , except where comprising more individuals than average , or employing public transport for the work journey . The majority of rail users come from car-owning households , and in many areas this is also true for bus use . In 1992 , 20.1 million private cars were licensed in Britain , corresponding to about 0.36 per head , or 0.88 per household . The most common category was the one-car household , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two or more cars , thus leaving 33% without a car ( TSGB93 , Tables 3.1 and 3.14 ) . The proportion of households with one or more cars has grown less rapidly than car ownership in total , as average household size has fallen . Its rate of growth has also declined . For example , between 1963 and 1973 this proportion rose from 36% to 54% , but by 1984 by only another 7 points to 61% , and a further 6 points to 67% in 1992 . Marked variations occur by area . The 1991 Census indicates that Glasgow still has 66% of households with no car , while in parts of the South East this figure is below 18% . Some 39% or more of households in inner London boroughs were without cars ( oPCS Census Monitor no 27 , October 1993 ) . I he effect of unemployment F he sharp rise in unemployment in the late 1970s/early 1980s had a very damaging effect on public transport in certain areas , especially older cities with declining industries . The recession since 1990 has also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversing previous growth . It may be described in a fashion similar to that of car ownership : for each extra person unemployed , a certain number of public transport trips is lost , together with the knock on effects of reduced household income causing a reduction in other trips . It has also been the rise that those becoming unemployed are more likely to have been public transport users . given their status and income . In West Yorkshire , a to THE ROLE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT loss of 18 bus trips/week per person becoming unemployed was estimated in the early 1980s . More generally , this could be represented as a loss of about 1% in local bus patronage for each one percentage point rise in the unemployment rate , within the range currently experienced ( around 5% to 20% ) . Car use is also affected , but perhaps less so , as the incomes of those still in work have continued to rise in real terms . Variations in public transport use The picture presented so far could be seen as a rather deterministic one , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as composition of the population and car ownership . However , while giving a broad background , this is by no means the whole story . Large variations may be found in public transport use associated with quality of service , urban structure and fares . These may all be influenced by transport operators and planners . Some operators have succeeded in retaining much higher trip rates per head than others . For example , in assessing variations in the share of all motorized transport held by bus services from late 1960s ' LUTS data , I found by that the share was about 14 percentage points higher in towns with their own municipal bus services than those covered by area companies ( typified by those in NBC ownership from 1969 to the late 1980s ) , after allowing for the effect of car ownership ( White 1976 ) . This in turn was associated with the higher level of service , and lower fares , offered on the municipal systems , these being a consequence of greater financial support and avoidance of the burden of cross-subsidizing rural operations which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better levels of reliability than larger company systems , benefiting from locally based management . Since local bus deregulation marked variations have been observed , with London and Northern Ireland ( not subject to deregulation ) retaining higher levels of use than the deregulated regions as a whole . However , individual towns benefiting from high-frequency minibus conversions have displayed substantial ridership growth as a result of frequency effects . Further consideration of the impacts of fares levels and structure is presented in Chapter 7 . A particularly worrying outcome since local bus deregulation ( on which further commentary is given in Ch. 10 ) is the loss of ridership in the metropolitan areas ? some 28% between 1985/6 and 1991/2 . In terms of the mix of users on buses , the greatest drop nationally between 1985/6 and 1989/91 was in working age ( 16 ? 59 ) males , of 25% ( NTS 1989/91 , Table 4.4 ) , i.e. those most likely to have the choice of using a car . There is also evidence of a stimulus to car ownership rates in the metropolitan areas ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus service quality ( Fairhurst 1991 ) . FORECASTING TECHNIQUES The London case I.ondon is of importance in its own right as a part of the public transport market the majority of rail travel and about 20% of all bus journeys in Britain - and also displays markedly different trends to public transport use elsewhere in Britain . Following a period of gradual decline from a peak of use around 1950 , the Underground network saw very rapid growth in use during the 1980s , from 498 million trips in 1982 to 815 million in 1988/9 , ( by 64% ) exceeding the previous peak around 1950 when car ownership was a fraction of the present level . British Rail peak period commuting into central London also rose by 21% during the same period ( TSGB93 , Table 1.3 ) . Bus use , while not experiencing any dramatic growth , remained fairly stable at about 1100 million trips per year from 1982 to 1992 ( TSGB93 , Tables 5.2 and 5.22 ) , in contrast to sharp drops elsewhere . The growth in central area peak demand ( concentrated wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment , notably in the financial services sector . Off-peak underground ridership growth and the high level of bus use may be explained largely by the stimulus resulting from the Travelcard ( see also Ch. 7 ) , and , in the latter part of this period , improved bus service frequency and reliability . The sharp growth in peak period demand resulted in several major rail schemes being put forward ( see Ch. 4 ) , although the fall since 1989 raises some doubts : is it simply a short-term impact of the current recession , or a longer-term effect reasserting itself ? Forecasting techniques Analysis of variations in patronage , establishing statistical links between them and causal factors , enables us to produce forecasts of the likely effect of change in variables such as real fares , or frequency , and of external factors such as unemployment . The LOTS approach is based largely on predicting peak demands for motoriicd transport , and hence the infrastructure and rolling stock which may be required to meet it . Early studies in particular , focused largely on road network planning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the related surveys . LUTS forecasting begins with estimation of zonal populations and activities for a design year-typically 15 to 20 years after the survey date - to which trip rates ( per head , or per household ) are applied to estimate total trip generation . Both public and private travel modes may be estimated in this way , using different trip rates according to car ownership . The spatial distribution of these generated trips is then modelled using techniques such as the gravity model , in order to predict zone to zone flows . The trip rate falls as distance increases tali illustrated in Table 2.6 ) . The deterrent effect THE ROLE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT of this may be represented most simply by including distance itself as the variable in the model . However , it is time and cost which deter travel , rather than distance as such . These variables may be used instead , often combined into a single measure : generalized cost ( the perceived monetary cost of a trip , such as the bus fare or parking charge , plus the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those with cars available may be encouraged to use public transport - for example , trips terminating in city centres where high parking charges may be levied - and this modal choice is also modelled , taking account of factors such as generalized cost , the assumed pattern of car availability , etc . These techniques have been refined recently by the development of disaggregate models , and stated preference techniques , which describe more accurately individual behaviour , although requiring more sophisticated data than the traditional aggregate forms . A good general description of the LUTS technique is given by Bruton ( 1985 ) . The forecasts produced by late 1960s LUTS models for public transport appear in retrospect to have been rather optimistic . Although decline had already occurred from the early 1950s , they often predicted fairly stable levels of demand , despite rising car ownership . This was largely because fairly stable public transport trip rates per household were assumed : although account was taken of anticipated growth in car ownership , no allowance was made for reductions in level of service , or increases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet financial targets . In addition , the overall assumptions regarding economic growth , population and employment often proved very optimistic , especially in older industrial areas . A study by Mackinder &; Evans ( 1981 ) examined some of the earlier LUTS forecasts 10 years after they had been produced . Overall , an increase in motorized trips of 32% had been suggested ( taking public and private modes together ) , whereas in reality the total was little changed - a net rise of only about 5% . Within this , public transport use had declined and car use risen ( but considerably less than forecast ) . In addition , zonal populations and employment levels had been over-stated . Subsequently , even greater discrepancies may have developed , owing to the effect of unemployment and population loss in some areas . The overstatement of public transport use was associated mainly with a failure to allow for effects of fare and service level changes . In addition , confusion in earlier studies between household car ownership and car availability to individuals may have led to calibration of modal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public transport users . One should not , however , dismiss the LUTS approach entirely . The picture presented from the initial surveys may be a very useful one , and of value for short-to-medium term planning . Certain projects , such as major railway schemes , inevitably involve looking 15 to 20 years ahead owing to the time taken for construction and period over which such investments are evaluated . Although imperfect , some long-term forecasts have to be made . The 198I GI ' rs data and modelling framework has been used extensively fin testing alternative rail FORECASTING TECHNIQUES options in London , for example . For bus networks , however , much more shortrun change is likely . Certain elements of the LUTS approach have been incorporated in bus network planning methods , as described in Chapter 5 , notably the Volvo planning system ( v/PS ) , which includes zone-to-zone demand models . I iowever , they are based on much more detailed and up-to-date surveys , based solely on public transport users . The major alternative to the LUTS approach has been the development of timeseries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AT= aARF+bABM+C in which AT represents the percentage change in bus trips in a given area from one period to the next ( typically one year , but shorter periods may also be used ) , . RF the change in real revenue per passenger trip ( crudely described as average " real fare " ) , ABM the change in bus kilometres run - a surrogate for service levels - and C a trend factor . The last-named is usually negative , i.e. representing a decline owing to external conditions , such as rising car ownership and a more dispersed pattern of land use . The coefficients a and b represent elasticities applied to the percentage changes in RF and BM , respectively . In more recent years , a fourth variable has been added , to represent the effect of changing unemployment , for which a coefficient may be similarly calibrated . Such models have been found to give a reasonably good fit with observed data , and enable the effects of some policy changes to be assessed , such as a decision to reduce real fares , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real revenue per trip of - 0.3 has been found remarkably robust for cash-paid fares : price elasticities are discussed further in Chapter 7 . For the bus-km effect , the elasticity is less certain , since separating cause and effect in observed data becomes more difficult . An average of about +0.4 may be assumed , as illustrated in case studies of minibus conversion ( Watts et al . 1990 ) . However , where initial frequencies are relatively high the value is likely to be smaller : the most recent work in London suggests an average value for the whole network of about +0.18 ( London Transport 1993 ) . For the trend factor , a value of about - 1.0% to 1.5% per annum , excluding population change , may be assumed in most cases . Since deregulation , such models have fitted overall behaviour less well than before . Effects of instability and poor passenger information have offset the growth in ridership that would otherwise be expected due to the substantial growth in bus-km run ( for further commentary , see Ch. 10 ) . Where total population is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent variable in this model as trips per head of population ( the trip rate then being affected by fare and service quality ) , rather than subsume this effect in the residual " trend factor " , which already incorporates several variables . This form of model represents a considerable advance on the LUTS approach in several respects , giving a more accurate picture of ' short-to-medium run change . Ilowever , it is more appropriate for network wide assessment of policies such as fare changes , than use on individual links or routes . Modal split is THE ROLE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT not predicted directly , but is in effect incorporated in the model , since the factors which would cause total trips to be generated or suppressed are also those likely to encourage diversion between modes , e.g. a lower real fare may encourage some car users to switch to public transport , as well as extra public transport trips to be generated . Indeed , much of the change in bus use may reflect modal choice , not so much between car and public transport , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips . Other aspects of perceived quality of service may also be critical to the user , such as helpfulness of staff , ease of boarding and alighting , or convenience of ticket purchase . As in other models , the time-series technique should not be seen as giving a totally deterministic prediction , but a general guide as to the likely effect of certain changes . In both LUTS and time-series models , good quality data are vital , with due allowance made for bias in definitions of passenger trip discussed earlier in this chapter . // The technology of bus and coach systems Design of the vehicle In this section , general principles will be described , together with conditions specific to the UK market . Most references are to local bus requirements , with coach design issues identified where applicable . The designer has to produce a compromise between many conflicting requirements : to minimize fuel consumption , maintenance and purchase costs ; to maximize passenger capacity within certain comfort limits ; to permit ease of boarding and alighting ; to provide a smooth ride through use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quantified more easily than others . In particular , fuel , maintenance and capital costs can be combined in a single measure , whole life cost . Forecast fuel consumption and maintenance costs - for a given service pattern - may be discounted over the proposed life of the vehicle and added to capital cost to identify the vehicle which is cheapest overall . This enables trade-offs to be identified , such as the purchase of a heavy-duty vehicle - with its higher initial cost - to give subsequent maintenance cost savings , and hence a lower overall whole life cost . Such trade-offs will depend partly on the local circumstances . For example , in Western Europe and North America , labour-intensive maintenance costs have risen rapidly in recent years , making these a major factor in vehicle choice , whereas fuel costs represents only about 5% of total costs . In many developing countries , where labour costs are low , fuel costs may form up to 20% of total costs , and thus become a critical factor . The designer is also constrained by the legal limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and maximum weight on any one axle . In Britain , for twoaxle vehicles these are : Table // A rigid three-axle variant is also permitted ( used mostly for long-distance coach work ) with a gross weight of up to 25 tonnes within the same length . t Inlike most other countries , Britain has traditionally not imposed a maximum height limit as such , but a " tilt test " is applied , in which a single-decker must be lilted to 35 ? from the horizontal before toppling over ( for a double-decker 28 ? applies ) . Under harmonization of standards within the EU , a height limit of 4.57m applies to all newly constructed vehicles , some versions being slightly dower than this where bridge clearances are limited . In many other countries more severe constraints may apply , making double-deckers largely impracticable . The unladen weight is defined as the weight of vehicle structure . The term " kerbside weight " is also employed to describe the vehicle as ready for service ( including fuel , driver , etc . ) . The effective payload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average weight per passenger of 65kg is generally ass uned ( hence , for example , a vehicle of 17.0 tonnes gross with a kerbside Weight of 10.5 tonnes could carry 100 passengers ) . In practice , for a two-axle double-decker , the typical maximum capacity is about 85-90 ( 75 seated plus 10-15 standing ) . The gross weight constraint is more likely to cause difficulties in seh operation , when passengers are carrying heavy luggage or duty-free s . Legal constraints have changed over time . For example , not until 1981 did be articulated single-decker become legal for regular service , with a maximum length of 18m and gross weight of 27 tonnes . Today , maximum dimensions are about as large as the designer would wish , and smaller limits may often be mposed by road network conditions : the 12-metre maximum length , for exam ) le , is generally confined to long-distance work . Types of buses and coaches Major types of bus and coach found today include : Ninibuses the term " minibus " has a specific legal meaning in Britain , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for work other than public local bus services for example , vehicles operated under minibus permits by voluntary groups ) . Fhese are typically mass-produced vehicles based on integral van designs , modlied to incorporate passenger seating . More specialized designs , often fitted with wheelchair lifts , are used for dial-a-ride operations in many urban areas . It should also he noted that the term " taxi " applies to a vehicle of up to 8 seats ( i.e. small minibus ) , used for public service . I lowever , the term " minibus " is also widely used to cover the smaller of the ichicles used in public service , especially following their rapid expansion in iruain from 1984. 1 these are typically vehicles of 16 to about 30 seats , usually // based on mass-produced van chassis with a purpose-built body ( such as the Ford Transit , or Mercedes 709 series ) , or vehicles of a similar layout , with front engine , built as integral minibuses ( notably the Optare Metrorider ) . The earlier , smaller , models such as the Transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seating capacity , wider passenger doorways and more luggage space . Improved suspension and transmission systems are now incorporated to improve comfort and reduce maintenance costs . However , the benefits of low=priced spares through commonality with light goods vehicle models remain . Midibuses This term has no specific legal meaning , but typically applies either to the large front-engine minibuses ( such as the Mercedes 811 series ) , or in effect a shorter version of a conventional single-deck chassis , such as the Dennis Dart or Volvo B6 - a rear-engined vehicle typically seating around 30-35 which may be employed in a similar role to the smaller minibuses ( i.e. replacing larger vehicles to offer a higher frequency , as in many parts of London ) , or to substitute on a 1-for-1 basis for larger vehicles where average loads have fallen since deregulation . Standard single-deckers These are typically 10-12m in length : ( a ) Front engine , forward of the front axle and alongside the driver . A simple , robust layout , but with a high floor and interior noise levels . Popular in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no longer purchased in Britain . ( b ) Underfloor engine , mounted centrally or at the rear . This permits a wide front entrance adjacent to the driver . The underfloor version ( for example , the Volvo B10M ) is common both as a coach ( in which case high-floor bodies are often specified to increase luggage space and improve the passenger view ) , or as a local bus . However , to minimize floor height the rear engined layout is more common for local bus work ( such as the Leyland Lynx , or Optare Delta ) , albeit requiring a sloped floor , or step towards the rear of the vehicle , in order to accommodate engine and transmission . To improve access further , notably for wheelchair users , very low floor models have been developed , such as the Neoplan N4014 , or Dennis SLF . The seating capacity of single-deckers varies with length and pitch . For local service work , 45 to 54 seats is typical , with some layouts using five-across seating ( two persons one side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 , usually for school work . For intensive urban services , layouts with a high proportion of standing passengers may be used , such as 44 seats plus 20 standing . By further increasing the ratio of standing space , over 70 may be carried . For coaches , up to about 50 may be carried in the 12m length , with space for toilet , and a reasonable seat pitch . // Double-deckers These are usually on two axles , typically about 10m long , seating about 75 , of two configurations : ? Rear-mounted transverse engine . This permits low entrance and floor level . Current types include the Leyland/Volvo Olympian , Dennis Dominator , and Optare Spectra . ? Underfloor horizontally mounted engine ( Volvo D10M Citybus ) . This has a slightly higher floor , but better weight distribution . Articulated single-decker This usually comprises a four-axle front section with steered two-axle rear section linked by flexible connection permitting through passenger movement , based either on underfloor-engined chassis ( such as Volvo BIOM ) , or rearmounted " pusher " design . Very popular elsewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a capacity of over 100 , but rare in Britain , as a high proportion of seated capacity is usually preferred , and on this basis the traditional two-axle double-decker gives a similar capacity at lower cost . It should be borne in mind that the above examples do not include some minor design variants , or types now becoming obsolete in Britain ( such as the Routemaster in London - a front-engined , rear open-platform double-decker , with a roving conductor ) . Some current issues in bus and coach design Vehicle life and replacement policy Assumptions regarding optimal vehicle life remain somewhat crude , being based on accounting conventions and engineers ' judgement as much as precise calculation . In Britain , 15 years was typical on both criteria for full-size vehicles . This has tended to be revised upwards , especially for some of the types such as the Leyland National , following the abolition of the new bus grant - which until the early 1980s covered up to 50% of the cost of new vehicles - and the inability since deregulation of many operators to generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20-25 years may now be assumed , where vehicles are extensively refurbished and re-engined . The vehicle is required to pass a strict annual test , and the operator thus faces a trade-off between increasingly costly work to bring a vehicle up to the required standard as it ages , and complete replacement . The average life now found in Britain is now exceptionally high , and while refurbishment may enable some improvements to be incorporated , it does not , for example , provide the accessibility benefits now offered by very low floor designs . The proportion of full size buses 12 years old or more rose from 21 ' ' 4 iii I98O to ? l ? 1 in 1991 ( Bus and Coach Statistics Great Britain 1992/3 , table 2.2 ) . THE TECHNOLOGY OF BUS AND COACH SYSTEMS The increased complexity of modern vehicles has in many cases led to a rise in maintenance costs , both in real terms and as a proportion of total costs . Following local bus deregulation in Britain , sharp cuts in engineering staff reversed this trend , but this factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see above ) . After driver costs , vehicle maintenance forms the second largest element within total costs . If real labour costs begin to rise , then a shift back toward a shorter vehicle-life may be justified , especially if newer designs offer significant improvements in reliability and ease of maintenance . As a reasonable target , one might expect fleet availability of 85% to 90% ( i.e. the proportion of vehicles in a fleet available for peak-period service ) , but this may fall as average age rises . Optimal life of minibuses and lightweight vehicles Following extensive experience in Britain during the 1980s , a somewhat longer life than initially anticipated may be acceptable for minibuses , in the order of five to seven years for van-derived models , or up to about ten years for " midibus " vehicles such as the Metrorider or Dart . Nonetheless , the anticipated life is shorter than that for full-size heavyweight vehicles , and hence for intensive public service , low initial capital cost may thus be offset by a high annual depreciation charge . As a rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? 1,500 at 1993 prices for a wide range of vehicles , from minibuses to double-deckers ( slightly higher for some midibuses and articulated buses ) . The role of mass-production Bus and coach manufacture remains in many respects a craft industry , with small-scale production characteristic of both developed and developing countries . Although this has some advantages , in permitting many variations to meet users ' requirements and local bodywork manufacture in countries not large enough to make chassis or engines , it results in high unit costs . Only one model in Britain has been made on a production-line basis , the Leyland National singledecker , manufactured on a large scale during the 1970s , but ceasing production in 1985 . Energy consumption Typical consumption of dery for a large single-decker , or double-decker , is about 30-35 litres per 100 kilometres , or somewhat better for longer-distance services with fewer intermediate stops . As figure 3.1 shows , this is strongly influenced by stop spacing . For minibuses around 20 litres per I(X)km may be , n SOME CURRENT ISSUES IN BUS AND COACH DESIGN consumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the whole day ( full-size vehicles ) or 10 ( minibuses ) , this is about half the energy consumed per passenger-km for private cars . Some opportunities for improvements exist , although less marked than in the case of urban rail ( Ch. 4 ) , as unladen weight per seated passenger space is already low ( about 125kg , compared with 250kg for " heavy " urban rail systems ) . Regeneration - converting energy otherwise wastefully converted during the braking phase - may be incorporated , through flywheel storage , giving energy savings of up to 25% . However , at present fuel prices the necessary investment and added mechanical complexity is unlikely to he justifiable in financial terms . The main current problem in Britain is the low average load at which buses are operating since deregulation , reducing the rela-tive energy advantage over private car previously displayed . Eha tric vehicles Ax in the case of long distance rail ( see Ch. 9 ) , electric traction gives significant advantages over diesel in maintenance costs , availability , local pollution impacts and increased acceleration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often thought outdated , the trolleybus using a pair of overhead THE TECHNOLOGY OF BUS AND COACH SYSTEMS wires mounted above the vehicle - offers all of these features . Re-design of the overhead equipment has reduced its capital cost and environmental intrusion . Bradford , the last of many trolleybus systems in Britain , closed in 1972 , but following the oil cost increases from the following year , many elsewhere were renewed and extended , such as Seattle , Wellington and Lyon . Reintroduction in West Yorkshire has been proposed within Britain , but is currently deferred due to complexities arising from local bus deregulation , and the high unit capital costs of a small installation . A much smaller range of benefits is offered by battery buses , whose theoretical attractiveness is offset by limited range , high unladen weight and high cost of battery replacement , although an experiment using a battery-powered version of the Metrorider minibus began in Oxford in November 1993 . Noise levels and local pollution Although buses generally emit less pollution per passenger-kilometre than private cars ( notably in carbon monoxide , CO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy central area streets may result in pressures to remove buses , unless pollution and noise levels can be reduced . Acceptability within residential areas may also be critical . Within the EU , tighter requirements now exist for both passenger and goods diesel vehicles , notably in emission of particulates ( smoke ) . Under Euro 1 regulations , applying to new vehicles from October 1993 , the maximum allowance for particulates is 0.36g/KWh . Under Euro 2 from October 1996 this maximum will fall to 0.15g/kWH . Lower limits are also set for nitrous oxides ( NOX ) , CO , and hydrocarbons . While new vehicles , and those fitted with replacement engines , will meet these criteria , current fleet replacement rates mean that up to twenty years may pass before all buses meet such standards . An exterior noise level is now specified according to power ( in kW ) for new vehicles with over 9 passenger seats - 81dBA if under 75kW ; 83dBA for vehicles of 75-150kW ; and 84 dBA for vehicles over 150 kW . In some countries , experiments are currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacts . These include liquified natural gas ( LNG ) , compressed natural gas ( cNG ) , and methanol . Another approach , adopted by Transit Holdings ( whose minibuses serve the centres of Torquay , Oxford and Exeter via bus/pedestrian streets ) , is a dual-mode petrol-electric minibus , which can operate as a conventional diesel vehicle , or use the petrol engine to feed an accumulator . The vehicle operates under electric power in sensitive areas . SOME CURRENT ISSUES IN BUS AND COACH DESIGN Structural strength Coach accidents , where the collapse of the body in roll-over incidents has been a major cause of serious injuries and fatalities , have encouraged stricter requirements for the strength of bodywork , now incorporated in ECE regulations . Integral vehicles may offer significant advantages in this respect : designs such as the Leyland National also have much greater resistance to end-on collisions . Safety of passengers Most casualties in local service operation are associated not with vehicular accidents , but in boarding , alighting and movement within the vehicle by the passengers themselves , especially the elderly ( White et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grab rails , use of low step heights , and careful design of entry and exit , may all assist:Most new and refurbished vehicles now follow the guideline specifications produced by DPTAC ( Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee ) . One commonly used technique is to create a split step in the front platform , so that three small steps replace two larger ones . Another feature is to ensure that stairs in double-deckers rise toward the front of the vehicle so that passengers are not thrown downwards should sharp braking occur . A par , 1 ticularly dangerous feature is the retention of open rear-platform vehicles in London ( the Routemaster type ) . Alighting casualties have also been associated with the use of driver-controlled centre exit doors , to which stricter design criteria ( to detect obstructions in closing ) now apply . Many operators have reverted to a single entry layout , the time savings offered by simultaneous exit being marginal in most cases . Provision for the disabled Making boarding and alighting easier assists not only the elderly and the partially ambulant disabled , but also other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those suffering more severe disabilities , and the rapidly growing numbers aged over 75 , may not be able to use conventional systems . Provision of wheel-chair lifts on full-size buses is one solution , and some urban systems run such buses on specially selected routes and timings , able to carry both the disabled and non-disabled passengers . However , a more commonplace solution is the provision of special dial-a-ride services using minibuses , such as Readibus m Reading , and those in many parts of London . Another type of specialized service , often more cost-effective than dial- a-ride , is the Taxicard scheme in London , using standard taxis ( now constructed to incorporate wheelchair access ) . I lowever , a better solution may be to adopt very low Iloor buses , operated in place of standard vehicles on all day services , thus offering a wider choice of ci THE TECHNOLOGY OF BUS AND COACH SYSTEMS travel opportunities to elderly and disabled users , and improving access for all types of passengers . The first such services in Britain commenced in Liverpool in 1993 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union policy As standard regulations are adopted for bus and coach design within the EU , this will affect policy in Britain . EU regulations already specify maximum emission levels ( above ) , roll-over strength for coaches , and maximum coach speed ( 100km/h ) . It is likely that they will also affect access requirements for the elderly and disabled to standard vehicles , and possibly result in a sharper demarcation between coach and local bus designs in future , although this could have adverse effects , especially in rural areas , where the dual role of coaches provides useful economies in utilization ( see Ch. 8 ) . Ticketing systems One-person operation of buses is now almost universal in North America and Western Europe , apart from some busier routes in London . Two approaches to revenue collection and ticket issue may be taken : ( a ) All passengers are required to pass the driver , to pay a cash fare , produce a return ticket , or display a pass/travelcard . This system is general in Britain , with a tradition of most fares being collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that almost all passengers are entitled to travel , but imposes the penalty of extra boarding time , ranging from about 2.5 seconds for passholders or those with the exact change , to about 6 seconds or more where many passengers pay in cash and require change . As a result average journey speeds are reduced , and greater variation occurs between successive runs on the same route , as boardings vary . Statistical data may be collected through the machine issuing a ticket for each cash fare , and the driver may record each pass holder as they board . Developments in magnetic card and smart card technology now make it practicable to validate passes automatically ( without physical contact being required ) , enabling a higher degree of inspection , and a more comprehensive statistical record , to be obtained . ( b ) Most passengers have purchased tickets off-vehicle , either as passes , travelcards or self-cancelling multi-ride tickets . Drivers only deal with a very small proportion still paying in cash , and other passengers may board by any entrance . This gives much more rapid boarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant risk of revenue loss , despite checks by groups of inspectors who have power to levy fines or CONTROL AND SUPERVISION OF BUS SERVICES penalty fares . On the Dutch system , for example , virtually no cash fare collection on vehicles now takes place . Most single cash fares are now handled by driver-operated electronic ticket machines ( ETNts ) , such as the Wayfarer which can print extensive information on the ticket ( such as time of issue ) and store comprehensive data for management analysis ( although its use in practice is very limited ) . They may be linked with payment of the exact cash fare into a farebox to speed boarding . However , these systems do not reduce boarding times if cash fares are still applicable . The adoption of magnetic re-encodable , and smart card , technology offers a partial solution . Where a fixed decrement is made for each trip , then manual selfcancellation may be replaced by a card offering a fixed total value for travel , reencoded by a contactless reader each time a trip is made ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now handled in this manner ) . ETMs such as newer models of Wayfarer may incorporate card validators/encoders for this purpose . However , retention of the graduated ( distance-based ) fare scale in most parts of Britain makes such automation of cash-paid adult trips of little value in reducing boarding times on buses . The technology of fare collection can not be divorced from the need for simplicity in fare structures ( see Ch. 7 ) . On urban rail networks , however , with a closed system in which all stations are fitted with entry and exit barriers , re-encoding of tickets for variable sums per journey ( by time of day , distance covered , etc. ) is far more practicable , for /example on the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway , or the Washington Metro . Control and supervision of bus services Unlike railways , buses do not necessarily require any special control systems beyond those for road traffic in general . However , it is desirable that drivers can communicate with supervisors in emergencies , such as breakdown or assault . On denser urban routes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the irregularities caused by traffic congestion . Traditionally , inspectors at depots , stations and on-street stands have monitored buses and crews , using telephones and hand-held radios . However , this method is very labour-intensive and may give poor results if inspectors themselves do not work on a co-ordinated basis . A central control point is better able to detect overall patterns and take the most appropriate action to maintain regularity , while using fewer staff . al ) radios I he simplest approach is to fit all vehicles with cab radios , for direct-voice contact Most urban fleets are now fitted , and many coach operators also use such THE TECHNOLOGY OF BUS AND COACH SYSTEMS systems ( or employ standard cellular mobile phones ) . Their value in emergencies is clear , but on large networks they are often limited through the small number of wavelengths allocated to operators . Around 100 drivers or more may be served by a single channel , making frequent reporting of position impracticable in the airtime available . Cab radio may be supplemented by closed-circuit television cameras placed at strategic junctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium-size town , most congestion can thus be monitored through one control room which is also linked to each driver . Examples include Leicester and Nottingham . Automatic vehicle monitoring ( AVM ) For more complex networks , and those affected by more severe traffic congestion , automatic monitoring of vehicle location is desirable . Several systems have been attempted , such as BUSCO , introduced on London 's 36 group of routes in 1984 . The following main options now apply : ( a ) Use of a bus-mounted sensor which picks up signals from loops or roadside devices placed at frequent intervals , and converts the signal into coded form for transmission to a control centre . Similar coded messages may be sent and received by the driver ( for example , an instruction to turn short ) . A major example is the system used to support the Countdown real-time passenger information system on route 18 in London , launched in Autumn 1992. ( b ) Use of a standard commercial system , such as Securicor Datatrak , for which the operator pays a fee to receive frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of triangulation ( as used by Mainline in Sheffield ) . Communications with their driver or a real-time information system are then handled through the operator 's own system . Another commercially available system is the GEC Bus Tracker ( as used by Armchair Transport for tendered services in west London ) . ( c ) Use of global positioning systems ( GPs ) using satellites ? for example , by PMT , the main operator in Stoke on Trent . All such systems are only of value if supported by a control strategy , such as drafting in extra vehicles and crews ( if available ) to fill gaps in service , re-allocating vehicles and crews between routes at termini , or turning trips short in one direction to cover a gap in the other ( unpopular with passengers for obvious reasons ) . In many cases , scheduled running times do not reflect realistically traffic conditions often experienced . AVM systems or on-bus data recorders ( such as the Optimiser ) may be used to obtain a large sample of running times from existing operations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , reducing the need to introduce unplanned variations . // Passenger information systems Quality of information provided on bus services remains poor . Even simple busstop displays of route number , destination and departure times are often lacking . Fares ' information is very rarely provided . Simple displays , showing departure times from each stop for each destination may be more effective than use of full timetable sheets . Ready availability of maps , timetable leaflets and leaflets on fares provides the user with much of the information s/he requires . The most effective back-up would appear to be a telephone enquiry service with a well publicized number . AVM systems can also be linked to passenger information displays to indicate when the next bus for a given destination is arriving . Following introduction of the Countdown system on route 18 , London Transport is now extending this concept to the heavily used Uxbridge Road corridor , and plans wider use over its network . Experiments are also in progress ( at 1994 ) in Southampton ( Stopwatch ) and Birmingham . Actual waiting times are not reduced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional conditions , enables more effective planning of journeys . In several Canadian cities , the Teleride computer-based telephone answering system enables the potential user to call from home before setting out for the bus stop : this approach may be particularly appropriate in low-density suburbs . It may simply consist of a synthesized voice working from the fixed schedule , or , in more sophisticated versions , be linked with AVM . Buses on road networks In very broad terms , measures which benefit all road users also benefit buses . Traffic lights reduce accidents and delay at busy intersections , new roads improve traffic flow , and traffic-management measures enable existing networks to handle heavier flows and/or higher speeds . However , the opposite may also he true . One-way schemes increase route mileage , and may take buses away from passenger objectives . At traffic lights , a relatively long cycle time maximizes total flow but as shown below leads to significant and variable delays for buses . A case for bus priority can therefore be made , firstly , on grounds that buses should not suffer adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buses can be made more attractive , for example by permitting them to use a direct route via a contraflow lane when other traffic is re-routed around a one-way system . They can thus retain more passengers . In conditions of scarce road space , giving priority to the most efficient users of that space ( buses ) may reduce total travel time within the network . 1 ) p to a third of bus journey time ( especially in peak and/or congested conditions ) may he spent stationary roughly half at passenger stops , and half at THE TECHNOLOGY OF BUS AND COACH SYSTEMS traffic-light controlled intersections ( together with other junctions , pedestrian crossings , etc. ) , which are in any case those with the heaviest flows . Reduction of time at stops may be attained through appropriate ticketing/boarding systems ( see above ) . How can similar reductions be obtained at intersections ? For the majority of road users , average time taken to pass through an intersection is the only relevant criterion . The traffic engineer is also concerned with maximizing the flow of Pcus ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 passengers receives little more weight than a single car . However , buses form a time-linked system , so that delays to one affect others . Consider Figure 3.2 . Buses are scheduled to depart from A at 3-minute intervals . Passengers accumulate at each stop at the rate of two per minute . Each takes 5 seconds to board , and hence average scheduled time at each stop is 30 seconds . Scheduled running times between stops and across intersections ( 20 seconds ) are shown . Assume that the first bus just misses a green phase at the first traffic lights ( or joins a queue of vehicles which does not discharge entirely during the first available green phase ) . It is delayed for 80 , instead of the scheduled 20 seconds . When it reaches the next stop , more passengers have accumulated , and hence stop time is extended . This process is repeated at each stop , the bus running further and further behind schedule . The following bus has fewer passengers to pick up , and hence gains on schedule . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , and the second bus only the scheduled delay at each junction , the two buses will be only 45 seconds instead of 3 minutes apart at B. Delay to passengers at stops is likely to be found particularly inconvenient and irritating , and is customarily given a value up to twice that of in-vehicle time . This example also illustrates the effect of boarding times in aggravating irregularity , and the difficulty of running a regular , very high frequency service : the theoretical benefits of substituting small minibuses for full-size vehicles may be thus to some extent offset where small headways are already offered . A simple solution would be to reduce traffic light cycle time and hence interBUSES ON ROAD NETWORKS vals between each green phase . However , this would reduce total junction capacity by increasing the proportion of inter-green time ( i.e. that in which a green aspect is not displayed for any flow ) and if the junction were already working near saturation , this could merely worsen congestion , in which buses would also be delayed . But if , as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area were reduced , this solution could apply . At the least , one can ensure that each bus reaches the junction so that the next available green phase is used . By making the nearside lane bus-only , buses can overtake queues of other traffic . Many of these with-flow priority lanes were introduced during the 1970s , and they remain the most common form of bus priority measure . This success depends upon adequate enforcement ( often lacking ) , and queues into which other traffic is placed not being so long as to obstruct other junctions which are also used by buses . Extra traffic wardens may be needed to deter kerbside parking in the bus lane . Variations in hours of operation of lanes ( many are peak-only ) , and lack of physical separation of with-flow lanes from other parts of the road surface add to these problems . Colouring of the tarmac in the lane aids enforcement . If the with-flow lane is taken right up to the stop line at the junction , this may reduce total junction capacity ( in terms of Pcu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lane . It is standard policy to terminate the bus lane short of the stop line : buses can still get close enough to be able to use the first available green phase , but other traffic can also make use of the junction capacity . In order to avoid extra running time and diversion from passenger objectives when one-way schemes are introduced , buses may be allowed to continue to use a road in both directions , those against the ( new ) one-way flow in a contraflow lane . Although a few may be separated from other traffic merely by a solid white line ( as for with-flow lanes ) most are physically separated by a series of traffic islands or raised curbs . Major examples may be found in London , such as Tottenham High Road or Piccadilly . In some cases the concept may be taken further by having a segregated section of road surface for two-way bus traffic , as near ( litre du Nord in Paris . A merit of contra-flow schemes is that they are largely self-enforcing , and substantial increases in bus speeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used only by buses , rutting may develop , requiring more frequent resurfacing . One part of the Runcorn busway has been relaid in concrete slab form for this reason . There is also a problem of pedestrian safety , and it may be necessary to confine their movement to light-controlled crossings by use of barriers . In order to make them more conspicuous , buses now show their headlights throughout the day when in contra-flow lanes . Another common means of giving buses priority is to exempt them from right turn bans , causing little delay to other traffic but giving significant time savings . Many examples can be found in London , notably at Parliament Square . Buses can also he given the benefits of selective detection approaching traffic lights , enabling either an exteusion of an existing green phase , or bringing forward the rII THE TECHNOLOGY OF BUS AND COACH SYSTEMS start of the next green phase . Losses to other traffic may be compensated by extending green time on the next phase . Variation in delay to buses may be markedly reduced , especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those vehicles entitled to such priority to be detected clearly . The MOVA demand-responsive software fitted at many isolated junctions has been adapted for this purpose . Urban traffic control ( uTC ) schemes have been introduced in many cities , in which optimal use is made of an entire network - in terms of capacity , and/or minimizing delay - through central computer control . A common feature is the provision of a " green wave " in which a platoon of vehicles is able to experience a green phase on most signalled junctions it crosses , by the green phases at each successive junction being offset to allow for the average speed of vehicles in the platoon . However , running times of buses between junctions may be longer than for cars owing to the presence of intermediate stops and lower acceleration . Buses may thus fail to benefit , or even hit more red phases than before . A revised version of the traditional fixed-time linking system called Transyt was introduced in Glasgow , in which offsets between green phases were timed to suit buses , and duration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after allowing for delay owing to intermediate stops . Bus speeds increased by about 9% , with no significant worsening for cars . More recent systems such as SCOOT ( split-cycle offset optimization technique ) have also been adapted to allow for buses . Other recent examples of bus priority include schemes in which the bus lanes continue up to the junction stop line , and an advance phase is provided for buses . Examples may be found in Swansea and in Shepherds Bush ( west London ) . The latter is of particular value to the many buses turning right within the gyratory system . It will be evident from the above that much of the benefit of bus priorities comes through reduced variability in journey time rather than any dramatic increase in average speeds . Their evaluation thus depends upon assessment of changes in passenger waiting time as much as that in-vehicle , as highlighted in the Buchanan consultancy study of London bus priorities in 1986 . Stations and interchanges The great majority of bus passengers continue to board and alight at kerbside stops . For local services , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good access to passengers ' destinations , and permit cross-centre linking of services . The value of on-street stops can be enhanced by introduction and enforcement of parking restrictions , and provision of better shelters with timetable information . Their costs may be offset by advertising . Bus stations are required for rural and long-distance services , and interchange especially with rail in large cities . In some cases , however , they may have been // built to " tidy up " town centres rather than aid bus passengers . Under pressure of competitive services following deregulation , some operations have shifted back to on-street stops in some towns where stations are poorly sited , and to reduce charges paid . Figure 3.3 shows some common station layouts . For high-frequency services , a through-platform design is often best , buses moving parallel to it . Space between platforms should be sufficient for buses to overtake one another . How-ever , a large area may be needed , and many points of conflict between bus and pedestrian movement occur . The end-on and " sawtooth " ( or " echelon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , on which all facilities such as wailing rooms and enquiry offices are concentrated , with the front doors of buses adjoining the platform . This layout is favoured for many rural/inter-urban or small town stations , but is limited by the need for buses to reverse on departing , // with associated accident risk : a modification introduced by Greater Manchester , the " shallow sawtooth " , overcomes this . Other layouts offering minimal pedestrian/bus conflict , and concentration of activities , are the " island " and " harbour " types , as found at Newark and King 's Lynn , respectively . The " island " type can be expanded by end-on loading of buses along each side , as at Preston . The main platform may also be entirely enclosed , and access to buses given through sliding doors . Many stations in medium-size towns combine both through-platform and end-on layouts for different types of service . All of the above layouts may be used also for bus/rail interchanges , with a further aim of minimizing pedestrian conflict in access to the rail platforms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " island " where the railway is underground , access to rail platforms being given by stairs or escalator in the centre ( as at the Broadway Centre , Hammersmith ) . Busways and bus links The concept of providing bus priorities on existing roads may be extended to that of allocating the whole road space to buses , and/or building separate busways , usually conventional road structures of about 7.0m width , with one lane in each direction . They may provide new direct links , access to areas not open to general traffic , or routes parallel to existing congested roads . The simplest form is where an entire street is restricted to bus and delivery vehicle use only , typically a town centre shopping street from which other traffic has been taken by an inner relief road . Buses thus continue to serve the heart of the town , and cross-linking of services is made easy . Major examples include Broad Street in Reading , Cornmarket in Oxford , and High Street in Exeter ( the last for minibuses only ) . The traditional road surface may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area re-surfaced to permit mixed bus/pedestrian movement , as in Oxford . Average speeds may not rise substantially , but delays owing to congestion are largely avoided and excellent access provided . Within residential areas , bus links may be provided , in which direct routeing is provided for buses , but other traffic is banned . Buses thus benefit from efficient network structures , but intrusion from other through-traffic is prevented ( see also Ch. 5 ) . Examples may be found in new towns such as Bracknell and Washington , and also in some older towns where previously indirect routeings have been replaced in this manner . Even for flows of only two or three buses per hour , operating cost savings can justify such investment , not to mention passenger time savings . However , buses in residential areas and others in which " traffic calming " is applied , have in some cases suffered from inappropriately designed speed humps . Recent work has established more suitable designs which may be negotiated safely by buses while meeting the objective of reducing car speeds ( Hodge 1993 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden ) , an experiment involved the linking of short busways in housing areas with priorities on existing roads and in the town centre , together with the use of short raised platforms at bus stops , similar to those on light rail networks . Boarding and alighting was thus made much easier , by matching platform and bus floor heights . Stop time was reduced , and access for the disabled ( including wheelchairs ) made much easier . However , the very low floor design is more likely to be employed in future to achieve this aim ( see above ) . By these means , an incremental approach to investment can be adopted , in which many of the benefits associated with rail systems can be provided through gradual improvement of existing bus networks , also retaining the better accessibility of the bus . Unfortunately , current policies in Britain make even these modest schemes difficult to plan and finance ( although , paradoxically , large-scale rail projects are more readily financed ) . In terms of extensive new busway construction , the major example in Britain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , where most of the network is provided by busways , enabling services to operate at an average of over 32 km/h , compared with about 19km/h for buses entirely on conventional streets . The busway concept has been developed recently into the guided busway ? a narrower surface ( although taking a standard-width bus of 2.5m ) , on which the bus is guided laterally by use of small , horizontally mounted wheels set adjacent /to the main running wheels , running against steel guide rails . The total width required for the busway is thus reduced by up to 25% , and the driver 's task made easier . As with other busways , incremental development is possible , as buses fitted with the guidewheels can run quite normally on the rest of the road network . The most extensive development of this idea has been the O-Bahn , pioneered by Mercedes-Benz in Germany . A 3.8km section in Essen sharing space with a tramway opened in 1981/3 . This has been followed by schemes elsewhere in Germany . Worldwide , the major example is the North East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large residential area , both by park &; ride facilities , and a network of through bus services into low-density housing areas . ( Lipid growth contrasts with decline in bus use elsewhere in that city : the scheme has been notably successful in attracting car users , and working-age male commuters . In Britain an experimental section of guided busway , used by conventional double-deckers , operated in Birmingham ( under the name Tracline ) for a period in the mid-1980s . The first substantial application is on two corridors in Leeds , work on which began in 1994 . The most dramatic application of the busway concept is as an alternative to sail construction for heavy flows into the centres of large cities . Experience of such busways in several South American cities , and of reserved lanes in the Lincoln ' funnel in New York , indicates that passenger flows of up to 20,000 to 25,00I per hour per lane in one direction may be attainable , that is as great as 6:1 THE TECHNOLOGY OF BUS AND COACH SYSTEMS any rail route in Britain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence passenger boarding rates . ( Gardner et al . 1992 ) . In many respects , the choice between bus and rail technology ( except where substantial underground operation is unavoidable ) lies in passenger service qual-ity , rather than peak capacity per se . Conclusion We can see that most immediate technical issues in bus and coach operation , are with the choice of vehicle itself , but also that there is great benefit to be derived from looking at urban bus operation in particular , as a system in which fixed investment in control and information systems and reserved track may produce many of the benefits normally associated with much more costly urban rail projects . 64 // Urban railways and rapid transit systems Early developments During the nineteenth century , railways served almost all demands for mechanized transport , including those within urban areas . Specialized urban railways developed in the largest centres , notably the London Underground system from the opening of the Metropolitan Line in 1863 . Main line railway companies also developed a strong interest in suburban traffic , especially where long-distance demand was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London displayed mark/edly greater interest than those to the north and west . In smaller British cities , Frequent steam-hauled services played an important role towards the end of the century , as in Stoke on Trent , Edinburgh and Birmingham . The growth of electric tramways at the turn of the century , often under municipal ownership , caused a rapid transfer of short-distance trips to this new mode , which offered much better accessibility and frequency than railways , whose routes had been located primarily from the viewpoint of long-distance traffic . It was the tramcar , not the railway , which gave the first opportunity to the majority of the population to make frequent use of mechanized transport . The railways responded by closing some minor routes - leading eventually to the complete closure of local systems in cities such as Stoke or Edinburgh during the Beeching era of the 1960s - and concentrating on longer distance suburban flows , and movement within congested centres of very large cities , such as London . Suburban lines were electrified to improve speeds from the first decade of the twentieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Birkenhead ; Manchester to Bury ; and on Tyneside ) . In the London region this process greatly accelerated during the 1920s and 1930s to produce much of the present network south of the Thames . After World War Two this was followed by further extensions south of London , east London , and Glasgow . A renewed spate of investment led to further schemes north of London in the 1970s , notably extensions of the Glasgow and Merseyside networks . Main line electrification had also permitted local schemes as a by product , notably in Manchester . A more dramatic development was the growth of self contained urban railway // schemes , typically located underground in city centres , and often known as metros - after the Paris system , inaugurated in 1900 . Other early examples included Hamburg , New York , Chicago , and Madrid . By 1940 , seventeen such systems were in operation , including Moscow , Osaka and Tokyo . A boom in metro construction then followed from the 1950s . A further 49 systems were opened by 1984 , and about another twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as Oslo and Marseille , have opened metros , but some of the most heavily used systems are now found in the very large cities of Asia and South America , such as Hong Kong and Mexico City . Further growth in these regions is likely to produce much of the overall increase in metros . In Britain , investment levels have been lower , but substantial improvements have been made to the London , Merseyside and Glasgow systems , and the Tyne and Wear Metro has been created largely from former BR routes . Light rail has been introduced in the form of the Docklands Light Railway ( DLR ) in London , Manchester Metrolink , and Sheffield Supertram . In Britain also , the street tramcar largely disappeared during the 1950s , and only the Blackpool system remains . However , many medium-size cities elsewhere in Europe retained their systems , which have been developed into light rapid transit networks , acting either as the major framework in the public transport systems ( as in Gothenburg or Hannover ) , or feeders to underground railways ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserved track extensions , and older sections of the network placed on reserved track ( sometimes in tunnel ) , so that most of the network is thus aligned . Types of urban rail system Four types of urban rail system may be distinguished , the first two using German terminology . U-Bahn This is an underground railway , usually running within the built-up limits of a city , giving good penetration of the city centre by tunnels ( however , well over half the network may , in practice , be sited on the surface , or elevated track , outside the centre ) . Ownership is usually vested in the city transport authority , and the network largely self-contained . Close station spacing ( about 1000m on average ) permits a very high proportion of passengers to reach stations on foot , and all-stations operation of trains is normal . Simple fare systems , often flat rate or zonal , apply . Examples include the London Underground , Hamburg , Stockholm , Munich and New York . Although often adopted as a generic title for such systems , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very close station spacing and short routes ( apart from the Rt:R regional express metro system ) . TYPES OF URBAN RAIL SYSTEM S-Bahn This term denotes those routes of main-line surface railways on which a frequent service geared to local traffic is offered . Station spacing within the inner city may approximate to that of the U-Bahn , but intervals of 2 or 3km are more common . Average speeds are higher , despite lower acceleration rates . Peak service levels have often been limited by lack of track capacity , although there has been a general trend to segregate such services from long-distance operations through provision of separate tracks and stations . This may be taken further , to construction of new extensions purely for such systems , including city-centre routes in tunnel : this may offer a much cheaper alternative to building a new Metro , while giving many of the same benefits . Examples include Hamburg , Frankfurt , Merseyside and Glasgow . The Thameslink service , re-using an old tunnel between Farringdon and Blackfriars to create strategic cross-London links ( such as Bedford-King 's Cross-Gatwick ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat longer-distance traffic . light rapid transit ( LRT ) ( also known as light rail transit ) This term is applied to electrically powered systems with characteristics similar to U-Bahn , but generally without block signalling ( see below ) , full-height station platforms or ticket issue at all stations . Trains of up to three or four single cars , or one or two articulated cars , are usually operated . Many of the advantages of the " heavy " U- or S-Bahn systems are given , together with better accessibility , for a much lower investment , albeit at less capacity . Except in the largest cities , such systems are generally adequate for peak flows . Most have been developed from upgraded street tramways , but entirely new systems have been opened since the 1970s , including Calgary and Edmonton ( both in Canada ) , San Diego and Buffalo ( usA ) , Manila ( Philippines ) and Utrecht ( Netherlands ) . The Tyne and Wear system uses some of the same techniques , but is closer to " heavy " transit . The Greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British example of this new generation , using street-based technology to provide a cross-city link , while incorporating through running over former BR suburban lines . In some cases , tramways have been upgraded to form an intermediate stage to " heavy " urban railways or metros . For example , the " pre-metro " in Brussels comprises city-centre tunnels and stations served initially by trams , and later by conventional metro trains . In other cases , a tramway may be upgraded by extensive construction of-city-centre tunnels , and some stations at which all tickets are sold prior to hoarding the vehicle ( " semi-metro " ) , for example in Stuttgart . An advantage of such systems is that trains can he diverted into relatively short sections of tunnel as they are built , rather than waiting for a major portion of the system to he completed below operations can commence . // Automated systems For some years , control technology has made fully automated operation ( with no drivers or station staff ) quite feasible . Several airport systems have been built , mainly in the USA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the first such systems for general public use opened in Japan ( Kobe and Osaka ) in 1981 . They have since been joined by several other Japanese systems , and the VAL in Lille ( France ) , opened in 1983 . The latter was the first to penetrate a traditional city centre , providing the same function as a traditional metro , and has operated very successfully . Further systems are now in use , including Vancouver 's Skytrain . Flows handled are of similar size to those suited to LRT , hence the term ALRT ( automated light rapid transit ) being used in some cases . The DLR , the first part of which opened in 1987 , also falls into this category , albeit retaining on-train " captains " for customer contact . Basic system characteristics Capacity Capacity is a function of three variables : 1 . Passenger capacity of each car Typically about 100 to 150 , dependent upon the proportion of standing-to-seated passengers , level of comfort accepted , and size of car ( LRT cars generally being smaller , and some " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built to a larger track and/or loading gauge than normal ) . A distinction may be drawn between " tolerable " loads , including some standing , and " maximum crush " ( with greater standing densities ) at the peak : in the case of London Underground tube stock , about 800 and 1,200 per train respectively . The proportion of seated passengers may be greatly increased by use of double-deck stock . This is found extensively on the Paris system for longer-distance commuting , and several other major cities , but is impractical in Britain due to the restricted loading gauge . 2 . Average length of train Up to ten or twelve cars may be possible in the case of S-Bahn , but U-Bahn lines are generally limited by platform length to seven or eight ( although newer systems may take more ) , as in the case of London . For LRT , up to three or four single cars , or two articulated cars , is typical . 3 . Headway between trains Block signalling applies to all U-Bahn and SBahn lines , and some newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ch. 9 ) , implying a minimum headway of about 75 to 90 seconds . To allow some margin for minor operating delays . 91 ) to 120 seconds may he taken as a practical minimum ( i.e. 30 to 40 trams per hour ) . I RT cars BASIC SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS may operate at intervals of down to about 45 seconds with control by drivers on sight distances . Putting these factors together , the maximum passenger flow in one direction per hour ( for a double-track route ) can be estimated . For example , if each car takes 150 passengers , there are 8 cars to a train and 30 trains per hour , the flow will be 150 x8 x30 , or 36,000 . In Europe , rarely is more than 25,000 required . S-Bahn routes may have lower capacity owing to sharing of track with other services and LRT routes a maximum of about 5000 to 15,000 per hour . In large cities of the developing world , higher capacities may be required : the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway , for example , attains up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , having been built to a modest capacity , partly as a means of stimulating land use development in London Docklands , rather than catering for existing passenger flows . However , development occurred more rapidly than initially envisaged , thus requiring the system to be rebuilt soon after coming into operation . Initially , single articulated cars with a capacity of 220 each offered 8 trips per hour on the section between the City and Westferry ( 1,760 passengers per hour ) . This was increased firstly by expanding frequency to 16 trains per hour and doubling train length ( giving 7,040 per hour ) . By bringing the headway down to 2 minutes ( i.e. 30 trains per hour ) this can be further increased to 13,200 passengers per hour . It is clear from the above that the time taken to clear a block section is a critical factor . This is determined firstly by the length of the section ( in re-signalling schemes , introduction of shorter sections thus becomes one means of raising capacity ) , and secondly by the average speed through the section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose duration ( " dwelltime " ) may be minimized by setting platform and train floor heights equal , and providing a large number of doors per car , of sliding or plug form . Lower platforms on some SBalm , and many LRT lines , may cause delay . Trams for operation on both street and in tunnel often have steps adjustable for loading at various heights . On some automated systems , a platform edge screen with sliding doors to match those on the train ( as for a lift ) are fitted , preventing passengers from falling on the track , and also minimizing delays : the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit also has this fealure ( in this case largely to permit efficient air-conditioning of stations ) . It is to be incorporated in new heavy metro lines in Paris , and the Jubilee Line Extension in London . Delays in block sections owing to stops may also be reduced by adopting higher acceleration and retardation rates to/from running speed . New stock typically attains an acceleration of around 1.2m per second per second , although older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required as a result . It will he evident from the above that one means of avoiding the need to build new tracks to raise peak capacity is to improve train performance . This may increase energy consumption and the capital cost of ' new rolling stock , but will generally be much cheaper than new construction . // The above statements assume implicitly that trains possess identical performance . Where speeds and acceleration rates vary , peak flows may be much lower , especially where trains with urban performance characteristics and those for long-distance work are mixed on approach tracks to main-line stations . Power supply and control Direct current ( dc ) supply is typical , usually at 600-750V , via a third rail . This form of current and voltage is suitable for use on trains without rectifiers or transformers but requires the provision of substations at very frequent intervals , about every 3-5km . For dense urban traffic the cost of such substations is less than the extra on-train equipment , but for S-Bahn lines , especially those sharing intercity tracks , the 25kV ( 25,000V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ch. 9 ) may be adopted as standard . BR standardized on this system for suburban routes in north and east London , Greater Manchester and Glasgow , whereas the London and Glasgow undergrounds , Merseyrail and the network south of the Thames are based on third-rail dc . A third option is 1,500 dc by overhead supply , requiring about half as many substations as third-rail voltages , but using 750V motors in parallel : this has been adopted for the Tyne and Wear metro ( reducing substations from 13 to 7 ) and also on the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway . On trains , motors are usually mounted on the bogies , fed by current controlled through series resistor , chopper ( dc ) , or thyristor ( ac ) switchgear . Immediate supply of full-traction current to motors in a train at standstill would cause components to burn out . The traditional series-resistor system consists of banks of resistances connected in series , through which current is passed to the motors . These are successively switched out as acceleration occurs . About fifteen such steps occur in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by connecting the motors in series during the first stage of acceleration , and then in parallel . The series-resistor system is very well established and reliable , but involves a waste of energy as the resistances are heated ( warming the passenger saloon is one use for this by-product in cool climates ) . The alternative chopper/thyristor system is now in general use on new stock . It is a solid-state switching device , originally applied to ac equipment , in which a " gating " pulse of a few milliseconds breaks the main current flow at intervals which are varied to change its voltage . In the acceleration phase , waste of energy is avoided , and smoother performance given , of particular value where high acceleration rates are required . Provided that problems caused by high-frequency interference from the gating pulses to telecommunications equipment can be overcome , this system offers clear advantages . It also makes the use of regenerative braking ( see below ) much easier . // In Britain , a more conservative approach has been adopted by manufacturers and operators , and only with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the new Central Line stock for London Underground in 1993 has it become standard . The Hong Kong stock built in the late 1970s/early 1980s was initially of conventional series-resistor form , but has been rebuilt with chopper controls , in view of the energy savings obtained . A further development in modern European stock is the use of three-phase motors fed by inverters on the train , giving further savings in energy consumption and maintenance costs . Electric urban trains are almost entirely of the multiple-unit form , in which the switchgear is carried on each power car , which picks up current direct from the third-rail or overhead , being operated by controls from the driving car . A high proportion of axles in the train can be motored where high acceleration is required , without reducing passenger capacity , as all motors and control gear are mounted under the floor . Some push-pull working using separate locomotives linked to a control cab in the car at the opposite end of the train is also found , notably on SNCF lines in Paris and - using diesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Energy consumption Iinergy consumption is determined by two main factors : 1 . Acceleration Energy used is proportional to the mass of the train ( including payload ) multiplied by the square of the maximum speed attained . 2 . Overcoming rolling resistance Energy is used while accelerating and maintaining a steady speed , and is proportional to mass . Aerodynamic resistance is of little importance at the fairly low speeds attained by urban railways , although critical for intercity modes . However , it is a factor in tunnels , where little clearance is provided between train and tunnel , creating a piston effect . The need for frequent bursts of high acceleration , owing to close station spacing , creates a much higher energy consumption per gross tonne-km for urban stock than intercity : high acceleration may itself impose a weight penalty , owing to the higher proportion of motored axles ( up to 100% for rates of I.Or per second per second and above ) thus required . The energy required for the acceleration phase is often the greater part of total consumption , especially where stations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass , and urban rail stock is heavy relative to road vehicles , much of the expected energy advantage that one would expect vis-a-vis buses owing to lower rolling resistance disappears . Except where very high load factors are attained , energy consumption per passenger-km may be higher for urban rail than bus , as appears to be the case in Britain . A typical unladen weight per passenger space for a bus is about 125 kg , that for " heavy " urban rail stock about 250kg . Many techniques for reducing rail energy constnnption are available : // ? A downward gradient On leaving a station at about 1 in 20 ( 5% ) this aids acceleration , and retardation is likewise aided by an upward gradient on entering . This is used on some London tube lines , but for subway or surface routes such frequent variation in vertical alignment is less easy to incorporate . ? Reduced unladen weight of train Older motor cars may weigh as much as 45 tonnes , but new stock is much lighter . Use of stainless steel instead of conventional construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 tonnes . Further reductions may be obtained through aluminium or light alloy construction . BR EMU ( electric multiple unit ) stock built in the 1970s featured aluminium cladding on steel framework , but then reverted to allsteel construction , using the Mark 3 intercity coach shell ( classes 317-322 , and 455 ) . Nonetheless , substantial weight savings were obtained , a fourcar 455 set weighing 129 tonnes . More dramatic savings have been obtained in London Underground 's D78 District Line stock , in which use of longer cars , and a lower weight per car , enables a saving of 40% , through a six-car train of 146 tonnes replacing a seven-car train of 242 tonnes . Using longer cars ( within limits imposed by the loading gauge ) enables the number of bogies to be reduced , in addition to savings from lower body weight . Where longer cars are not feasible , articulation of adjoining cars over common bogies achieves a similar gain , as in the Tyne and Wear metro stock ( a two-car set weighing 38 tonnes ) , or three-car sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service on London Underground 's Central Line from 1993 uses large welded aluminium extrusions to give a weight of only 24 tonnes per car , all of which are motored . Identical cars operate the Waterloo and City line in London , and BR also has adopted aluminium construction again with the class 465 Networker . However , when the highenergy requirements for aluminium production are borne in mind , it is only for vehicles operating high distances each year that a net overall energy saving is obtained . ? Reduced length of train Some systems run shorter trains at off-peak periods . However , since the cost of electricity is determined largely by the peak ( see below ) , this is probably more useful in reducing maintenance costs . ? Coasting By cutting off power after the initial acceleration phase , energy consumption can be reduced substantially as rolling resistance has to be overcome only during the acceleration phase , i.e. that shown as phase t , in Figure 4.1 . Where constant speed is maintained during phase t2 a trapezoidal speed-time curve results , but an irregular curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 4. lb . The area under the curve rep resents distance ( i.e. speed x time ) . By using a higher initial acceleration rate the station-to-station trip may he completed in the same time , even with coasting . BASIC SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS Owing to the low rolling resistance on steel rail , loss of speed through coasting is marginal . For example , if two stations are 750m apart , and a train accelerates at 0.49m per second per second ( mists ) and decelerates ( phase t3 ) at - 0.75m/s/s , then at a steady speed of 9.89m/s during phase t , the trip takes 92.5 seconds . If the train is allowed to " coast " during phase t2 , losing speed at - 0.025 m/s/s , the same distance is covered in 98 sec-onds , an increase of only 5.5 seconds , or about 6% - yet an energy saving of about 25% would be obtained . The additional journey time between sta-tions might be offset by reducing station dwell time . ? Use of regenerative braking With friction braking , kinetic energy is con-verted wastefully into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train may be used as a form of retarder , generating current in this process . The simpler form is known as rheostatic braking , in which the current is fed into resistors to produce heat . This reduces wear and tear on the fric-tion braking system , and the heat may be used inside the car where climate requires . Better use of the current may be made by feeding it back into the power supply for use by other trains , known as regenerative braking . In theory , savings of up to 30% or more in net energy requirements may be obtained , although in practice this may be limited by factors such as the acceptability of regenerated current at substations , and number of other trains on the system at any one time which can use the regenerated supply . This has limited the net gain in most cases to around 15% to 20% , but with more comprehensive system design to make better use of regenerative motor characteristics from the outset , gains closer to the theoretical maxiURBAN RAILWAYS AND RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEMS mum may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of chopper/thyristor technology , and is now general on new systems , such as Sao Paulo and Dublin . It has now been adopted in Britain through the Networker and Central Line stock . Substations on the Sheffield Supertram are designed to accept regenerated current . ? Other forms of energy storage As in the case of buses , energy may also be stored on the vehicle itself through high-speed flywheels or batteries , thus overcoming the problem of finding other trains to use regenerated current . Rail vehicles can incorporate the weight and bulk of such equipment more readily than buses , but conventional regeneration is probably more practical . Flywheels have also been used to store regenerated current at a substation on the Tokyo network , thus overcoming the problem of feeding it back into the main supply system . Putting all these factors together , one can see scope for reducing energy consumption on some older systems by about 50% , mainly through a combination of reduced stock weight and use of regenerative braking . The main constraint in many cases is the rate of renewal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to aim for lives as high as 35 ? 40 years ( with interior refurbishment ) , but in consequence the rate at which energy-saving technology can be introduced is very slow . If energy costs rise , a more rapid rate of renewal may be justified . Internal layout of rolling stock For many years , a pattern of three or four sliding doors on each side of the car , with a high proportion of standing space , has characterized U-Bahn stock . Seating is often arranged longitudinally to assist this . In some recent London Underground stock a single-section sliding door has replaced the traditional double-leaf door ( for example , 1983 tube stock on the Jubilee Line ) , giving reduced maintenance costs without significant extra dwell time . High rates of acceleration necessitate many grab rails . For S-Bahn services , a higher proportion of seats , and fewer doors , are usually provided . This difference can be observed in London by comparing the C69 Circle Line stock ( with four sets of double doors per car to permit rapid loading ) , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with three sets of doors and five-across seating ) . On British Rail , the antiquated layout of slam doors was retained in new stock until the late 1970s , but here also sliding doors are now general . The sliding-door layout permits driver control , and with certain other modifications ( notably mirror or closed-circuit television display at platform ends ) enables driver-only operation ( DOO ) to be introduced . In Britain , it has applied from the start on the rebuilt Glasgow Underground , Tyne and Wear Metro , and Manchester Metrolink . It applies to several BR suburban and London Under ground lines , and is being steadily extended . On heavy rail systems , the driver BASIC SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS remains responsible only for driving as such , but on light rail he/she may also collect fares from some passengers , as on bus services . A passenger entrance adjacent to the cab may thus be required . The closing of sliding doors is controlled automatically by the guard or driver , but their opening may be actuated selectively by passengers , as on Lon-don 's D78 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold air , especially on surface stations . Where double-deck stock is used , as in Paris , this takes the form of an entry vestibule over each bogie , with steps into upper and lower saloons , the latter within a well section of the chassis . Signalling and control A system simpler than that found on main-line railways can be used , owing to regular timetable patterns , and lesser variation in speeds , braking distances , etc . The network of most U-Bahn systems is fairly simple , with few junctions and crossing points only at terminals or certain intermediate stations . S-Bahn may be somewhat more complex , owing to mixing with other rail traffic , but even in this case , tracks are often largely segregated from parallel main lines ( between Fusion and Watford , for example ) . A semi-automatic sequence of trains can be programmed , with manual control as an override to handle exceptions and emergencies . An entire network can thus be controlled from a single centre , such as that on the Tyne and Wear Metro . As on main-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working . A wain may not enter a block section until the previous train has cleared it . Fig-ure 4.2 shows this in simplified form . The train in section A can not enter section li until the train in that section has entered section C. The minimum length of block section is normally at least equal to the minimum safe braking distance hour the nutrinnun speed permitted , where signals are of the simple two-aspect ( red/green ) type . On surface railways ; the presence of the train in section was observed from URBAN RAILWAYS AND RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEMS signal-boxes manually , as shown in Figure 4.2 . On the tube lines in London such a method was clearly impracticable and at an early stage a system of semi-automatic block working was devised . Quite apart from the traction current ( from third rail , or overhead ) , a low-voltage track circuit current may be fed through the running rails ( ac where traction is dc , and vice versa ) . When a train enters a section it shorts the circuit set up by this current , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied . The circuit can also be interlocked with signals to ensure that the section is protected . Together with a trip-arm which ensures that a train passing the red signal will brake automatically , the system makes collisions between following trains on the same track almost impossible . The track circuit principle has also been adopted in main-line railways ( see Ch. 9 ) . Complete automation of " heavy " urban railways is possible . To date , this has mainly taken the form of automatic control of the train running between stations , with the driver remaining responsible for starting the trains , as on the Victoria Line in London , and the Paris Metro . High-frequency pulses through the traction supply determine rates of acceleration , maximum speed and retardation . A more efficient cycle can thus be followed - for example , to make the best use of opportunities for coasting described above . However , there is a danger of monotony for drivers as a result , and on the Paris Metro the automatic control is not applied running at off-peak periods . French systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the MAGGALY system on Lyon 's Line D in 1992 . This also incorporates moving-block signalling ( as distinct from the fixed block described above ) , enabling spacing of trains related to braking distance for the speed currently performed . Proposed for Paris is the Meteor line which will offer capacities in the order of 30,000 passengers per hour with fully automated working . The SELTRAC central system , introduced on the Beckton extension of the DLR , also incorporates the " moving block " concept . Information from track circuits and control centres can also be used to activate platform indicators. hi the traditional form in London , these simply display the sequence in which trains are due to arrive . These are being replaced by dotmatrix indicators , which display a real-time estimate of the number of minutes in which the train is due . This information has been found to be acceptably accurate , and of considerable help to passengers . Stations and interchanges Much of the high labour productivity resulting from one person driving a train with over 1,000 passengers on a heavy transit system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . Ticket issue may be automated to a large extent by use of machines designed to cover all destinations and ticket types . Cash sales may he further reduced by pre-sale of travelcards ( sec ( ' Ii . 7 ) and stored value tickets , which are decremented on use . ( ) n some older systems , station staff are retained to handle some types of ticket issue , as in London , but BASIC SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS complete destaffing is technically feasible , as the Tyne and Wear Metro has demonstrated since opening in 1980 . Ticket inspection may be automated by use of barriers which read magnetically encoded tickets , checking their validity , and if necessary re-encoding . Such stored-value tickets are used on the Hong Kong and Washington systems . If a complete closed-entry system is used , they may be reencoded at the end of each journey to allow for distance covered and rate applied ( peak or off-peak ) . On some systems , a simpler approach is adopted , as on the DLR , where the passenger is required to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass through a barrier as such . Strict enforcement through random inspections is a necessary feature on such systems , backed up by penalty fares and fines . Reliable ticket-issuing machines , to ensure that all passengers have had the opportunity of buying a ticket before commencing their journey , are-also essential . In designing stations it is desirable to minimize the number of changes of level , and make such changes as are necessary easier by use of escalators and lifts . The latter may also improve access for the disabled . Conflicting pedestrian flows should be prevented by use of separate passageways where possible . Well lit passages and platforms , with no blind spots , are desirable . Escalator width required for one person is about 60cm , 80cm with luggage , or about 1 m to allow overtaking . In order to reduce energy consumption created by continuous operation , escalators may be activated by passengers breaking a photo-electric beam . Increased emphasis is now being placed on accessibility for elderly and disabled users , which may justify use of lifts in addition to escalators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at different points on successive stations so as to distribute passenger loadings throughout the train . If only one entry can be provided , the mid-point is best , if two ( or separate entry and exit ) , then at quarter length from each end . The situation to be avoided i f possible is the repetition of the same entry/exit positions at successive stations , which result in some parts of the train being overcrowded , others almost empty . The terminal layout is particularly unsuited to suburban operation , as boarding passengers may concentrate at only one end of the train , while seats at the other remain empty . Further arguments for through-running in place of terminal working may be found in Chapter 5 . Where different routes can be arranged to run parallel at an interchange , cross-platform passenger movement may be possible , as at Oxford Circus ( Victoria/Bakerloo Lines ) or Hammersmith ( District/Piccadilly Lines ) in London . Imc k dud structures The cross-sectional area of rolling stock is determined primarily by the height of standing passengers , use of standard track gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train floor . A square cross-section of about // 3.5m is typical . Where power is supplied from overhead wires , a vertical clearance of about 4.5m may be required . More limited clearances may apply to lightrail systems , and on automated systems such as VAL ( Lille ) a narrower vehicle width can be adopted to reduce tunnelling costs : the high frequency possible with unmanned trains provides capacity to compensate for the reduced size of each car . On curves , swept area is a function of radius , body width and length . Shorter vehicles , or tapered ends , may be adopted ( as on street tramways ) to reduce lateral clearances . Surface tracks may be relatively simple , although use of continuously welded rail is now common as a means of ensuring a smoother ride ( although not , as yet , on the London Underground ) . Conventional rail track , with sleepers and ballast ( see Ch. 9 ) is generally used , although grooved rail is still used on street tramway sections of light railways , and concrete slab-base track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent maintenance costs and access delays . Tramways continue to operate through pedestrianized areas , and even new lightrail alignments of this sort are now accepted , as in Manchester . Bremen in north Germany was the first major city to pedestrianize its centre in the early 1960s , and the trams remain the only vehicles in major shopping streets . The swept area of cars is indicated by distinctively coloured paving . Where land is not available , the cheapest alternative alignment is an elevated structure . This may also be a means of avoiding conflict on the same level with other modes . This solution was common on early systems - the DLR partly follows such an alignment first built in 1840 - and substantial sections remain in New York and Paris . However , the environmental effects of such structures are often criticized . Newer elevated structures , using concrete , are much less intrusive , and noise levels may be reduced by adoption of rubber-tyred stock , as on the Marseille and Lille systems . An underground alignment became necessary in the largest cities because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most systems are subways , i.e. usually aligned not more than 10m below the surface and built on the " cut and cover " principle , often along existing major roads . The first London lines , such as the Metropolitan , were of this pattern , but at an early stage opportunities at this level were restricted by existing railways , sewers and the Thames . The deep-level tubes such as the Bakerloo were therefore built by shield tunnelling , of about 3.5m diameter . Reduced cross-sectional area limits train capacity and room for motors , etc . The depth required for access by escalator or lift , instead of a short flight of stairs , increases passenger access time , which will itself deter use especially for short trips . Hence , this alignment should only be adopted if unavoidable . A subway alignment , even if incurring more disruption during the construction phase , is generally preferable . Whereas the sub-surface metro in Paris is appropriate for short trips , the deep-level tubes in London require bus duplication for such travel . Londoners ' habit of referring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , and even more so in respect of others , Moscow 7R CURRENT PROSPECTS being the only other major example . Construction costs vary greatly according to local circumstances , including geology : as a very rough guide , they are in the order of ? 50 million upward per double-track route-km for subway or tube routes , with a similar additional cost per deep-level station . Elevated track may be much less than half this figure , with surface ( especially if following existing alignments ) cheaper still . The last point is well illustrated by the Manchester Metrolink , which uses light rail technology to provide the cross-city centre surface link , at very much lower cost than the previously proposed conventional rail with cross-centre tunnels . Current prospects The urban rail revival of the 1960s and 1970s is largely over so far as new " heavy " rail systems in North America and Western Europe are concerned . Falling population densities make substantial new construction difficult to justify . I lowever , those systems which have been built are generally well used , and have retained their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic . Further expansion is likely to take the form of modest extensions to existing networks , rather than entirely new ones or additional routes involving substantial extra tunnelling . However , major renewal investment will be needed , creating the opportunity for energy saving , improved labour productivity and better conditions for passengers . In Britain , urban rail use is dominated by London . Following the rapid growth in ridership during the 1980s ( see Ch.2 ) , extensive proposals for improvement have been put forward . These include the Jubilee Line Extension ( JLE ) to serve growing development in Docklands , for which the SLR may not be sufficient ; the ( ' rossRail scheme , linking Liverpool St and Paddington BR services in similar fashion to the RER of Paris ; expansion of the Thameslink service to provide a high-density north-south link across the central area , and a light rail system in Croydon , linking existing local BR lines with surface running through the city centre , akin to Manchester . The Central London Rail Study of 1989 evaluated options in central London ( hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indicating a positive cost-benefit analysis for CrossRail , and , more markedly , for expansion of Thameslink to increase capacity . Government approval for construction of JLE was finally given in October 1993 , following confirmation of previously negotiated private sector contributions . The future of the CrossRail proposal remains uncertain . Improved access to airports plays a major role . Following the Piccadilly Line rxtension to Ileathrow in 1976 ( and the loop to serve Terminal 4 in 1984 ) , the 1leathow Express ( largely funded through private sources ) is now being built , to provide a high-speed link from the Paddington route . The Tyne and Wear Metro was extended to serve Newcastle airport in 1991 . A new spur to Manchester air- // port was opened in 1993 , served by local and regional services . Proposals for rail access to Glasgow and Edinburgh airports are being evaluated . In the West Midlands , the main cross-city route on the largely diesel-operated network has been electrified at 25kV . Further plans for development in Glasgow , Edinburgh and Merseyside are active . As in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in improving access for elderly and disabled users on urban rail systems . London Underground lifted its previous ban on wheelchair users form October 1993 , and the JLE will be fully accessible , together with limited number of central area stations on other lines . The Manchester Metrolink offers improved access through raised platform sections within central Manchester ( elsewhere , former BR stations provide high-level platforms in any case ) , to permit access for wheelchairs . In parallel with bus design , very low-floor models are being developed , as in the trams being built by ABB Transportation in Britain for the new Strasbourg system . Taking a broader view of developed countries , a higher level of rail investment may be seen . The construction of fully automated systems is evidence of this : the initial VAL line in Lille has been followed by a second route in that city , and other systems , such as Toulouse . Some standardization of future automated systems is being attained in Japan . Capital costs are very high , but there is greater scope for covering operating costs than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , especially in terms of frequency , can be offered . A common feature of automated systems is the nationalistic basis on which they have been developed to date , with each country designing its own system . Not only does this lead to high initial costs , but also the risk that a successful system will not be adopted for use elsewhere , nor economies of scale from mass production attained . A feature of rail development in Britain until recently has been the need for each project requiring compulsory purchase or significant extension to existing schemes , to obtain a Private Act of Parliament : this process has been used for initial stages of SLR , Manchester Metrolink , and extension of the BR and LT networks . The rapid growth in rail schemes during the 1980s resulted in many such Bills being put forward , and the need for a simplified system was recognized . Under the Transport and Works Act 1992 rail and busway projects may be approved through an enquiry and ministerial order of similar form to that applied to road schemes : the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East London Line ( New Cross-Shoreditch ) to Dalston . However , separate Bills may still be required for controversial major rail projects , such as the Chan nel Tunnel Rail Link . // Network planning Typical structures The task of a traffic manager or transport planner is to effect the optimal balance between the desired door-to-door trips of individual users and characteristics - especially speed , capacity and cost - of the mode(s) available . A consequence is that different modes of transport serve different traffic densities , which in turn affects network structure . The minimum average load for a conventional bus service to be viable - averaged over the whole day in both directions - is about twelve passengers ( if all costs , including replacement depreciation , are to be covered ) . Lower traffic densities may be handled either by a smaller vehicle , such as minibus or shared taxi , and/or by a service financially supported by a local authority . For rail very much higher densities are required : for a new route several thousand passengers per hour would normally be needed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be justified by the fact that investment in infrastructure has already taken place ( or existing alignments may be re-used at low cost ) . A distinction may be drawn between public , scheduled services operating for most of the day , to which the above comments would apply , and those timed for specific traffic flows , such as from a housing estate to a school , on which only a few journeys may be operated . However , although total daily flows on such routes may be low , the break-even load per trip may be considerably higher when peak-only operation is involved , as discussed in Chapter 6 . Within this chapter , networks in urban areas and the adjoining rural zones arc examined . Aspects of rural networks as such are considered in Chapter 8 , and long-distance networks in Chapter 9 . Given the typical loadings mentioned above , many public transport services are confined to radial routes into town centres . In towns of up to 100,000 little else may be provided , save for school or works specials . As town size increases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more firmly established in larger cities , linking inner suburbs at high frequency as in London and Birmingham . Larger cities arc also parts of conurbations , such as Greater London , or the West Midlands , which have been formed from a group of formerly separate towns . Local bus networks locus upon each of these , over t ; NETWORK PLANNING laid by other bus and rail links to the main conurbation centre . Thus , local networks may be found in Stockport , Bury , Oldham , etc. together with rail services and trunk bus routes from each to the centre of Manchester . Such a situation lends itself to the creation of integrated bus/rail networks , especially where the local centre has a convenient interchange , as at Bury and Altrincham . Within large city centres , additional distributor services may be needed where walking distances from terminals become excessive . Within London , the Red Arrow buses from Waterloo , Victoria etc. are one example , although the radial bus and underground lines provide most of this function . City-centre bus services are also offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit 's high capital cost confines it to major radial corridors and central area distribution , although the North London Link does provide a somewhat exceptional service linking inner suburbs . Figure 5.1 illustrates in simplified form the typical network forms mentioned above . Urban form and land use The starting point of any public transport network must be the pattern of land use , which strongly influences the potential traffic . The public transport network itself may also influence the land-use pattern : although the car is now the main influence , the past structure of rail , tram and bus routes had a major effect on urban form , and improved rail services for long-distance commuting continue to affect the housing market around London . Density of population has a major effect on public transport demand : where it is higher , a better level of service may be justified , and/or lower fares be viable . A longer operating day and week , perhaps including all-night services , may be sustained . Housing density is perhaps the most important factor , followed by the degree of concentration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlated to a large extent , often also with the age of the city . Two measures of residential density must be distinguished : " gross " is that estimated from the population divided by total land area , including roads , schools , open space , etc . " Net " density is that of the area actually occupied by houses , private gardens , access roads , etc. and thus higher than the " gross " density for the same area . Table 5.1 relates housing type with residential density . In Table 5.1 , a household size of about 2.5 persons is assumed , based on the national 1991 Census average . The average has declined , as more old people live in households of one or two persons and size of completed family falls . Typical densities are also falling as more space per house is required for example , to provide garage space - although it may he the case that fewer rooms per house may he needed as the number of occupants declines . Although there is a general personal wish to entov mote space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some very low densities - or scattered rural development - in recent new construction , public costs are also incurred which may not be reflected in those perceived by the householder . There may be a case for higher densities , and a greater variety , than currently found . At the highest extremes , as in some Victorian cities and developing countries today , health may suffer from overcrowding and lack of open space . Construction costs may also be high where multi-storey dwellings require greater structural strength , provision for lift shafts , etc . Estimates some years ago by Stone suggested that construction costs ( excluding land costs ) are minimized at about 150 persons per hectare ( ppha ) , with two or three-storey dwellings . Much new housing is at densities well below this , incurring the following resource costs : ? Basic utilities such as gas , telephone , electricity and water require a greater length of pipe or cable to serve each residence , increasing capital and maintenance costs . ? Other services such as postal deliveries and public transport provision require regular servicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maintaining a given level of service , which rises further with growing real labour costs , unless offset by productivity growth . ? As urban areas expand , a loss of open space and natural habitats occurs . I.ittic incentive to higher densities is given by the present council tax system , and costs such as those of postal delivery are ( unavoidably ) averaged out , resulting in a cross-subsidy to low-density areas . From the public transport viewpoint , the situation is worsened by the stimulus given to car use and ownership in low density areas , as it becomes necessary to make trips that previously were within walking distance ( for example , to the local shop ) by this mode . A stimulus to higher densities might be given by reform of the local taxation system , if council tax were aligned more closely to a charge for services rather ' than an arbitrary assessment based on a notional value per house . Further arguments in favour of higher densities and illustrations of attractive designs that can he provided ( retaining ground floor access for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The densities of shops and workplaces have also tended to fall over time , although less so for some types of office work . From the public transport operator 's viewpoint , it is not so much the density as location of such development which is important . New out of town superstores are obviously far more auraeNETWORK PLANNING tive to car users , although some bus services are generally provided . If new office development outside traditional city centres can be encouraged to locate at public transport interchanges rather than greenfield sites , then there is a higher chance of retaining traffic . This pattern can be seen in the London area , where much new development has been outside the traditional centre , but near suburban rail stations such as Croydon , Wimbledon and Hammersmith . Town planning in Britain Until the late nineteenth century , urban growth was virtually uncontrolled . Housing conditions were insanitary , often with very little open space . Industry and housing were intermixed . Certain aspects of the subsequent shift to a planned approach may be seen as a reaction against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . Writers such as Ebenezer Howard in 1898 proclaimed the advantages of life surrounded by green open space , where housing and industry were separated . Rapid transit links between the areas of housing and industry thus separated were shown in the original concept , but often forgotten in later versions . Although construction of Garden Cities ( notably Welwyn ) began , the major impact was on suburban development from 1919 onward , in both the first largescale local authority schemes and the semi-detached boom of the 1930s . The low-density concept remained , but without the related planning for public transport or local facilities . This development - in-filling areas between tramway routes and beyond them - was made possible by the growth of bus services and private car ownership . The growth of motor traffic also demanded better roads . Principal radial roads were widened and extended beyond the previous built-up areas , such as the Great West Road in London . Bypasses ( often now within the built-up area ) and ring roads were also constructed . In broad terms , the same " ring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorway plans . Parallel with the Garden Suburb of the inter-war period was the " neighbourhood unit " concept , based on the vision of a relatively small-scale community permitting face-to-face contact , yet of sufficient size to justify facilities such as primary schools and shops . Within the neighbourhood unit , most facilities would be within walking distance , and through-traffic routed around the area - hence major roads were not well sited for bus services penetrating such areas . Similar developments occurred in other European cities , but at higher densities , and with the fundamental difference that municipal tramways were normally projected through the area , enabling public transport to offer good accessibility with little environmental disturbance - for example , in Stockholm . Some British cities also incorporated such tramway links , as in Leeds at Middleton Estate ( to he revived in current light rail plans ) , but in London , large estates were poorly sited with // respect to railways . This trend continued after the Second World War , with little allowance made for public transport in land-use planning . The supposed flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging planners to assume that public transport routes could be fitted in at a later stage , rather than incorporating them from the design stage . The concept of segregating through traffic from local movement was taken further in Alker Tripp 's book Town planning and road traffic in 1942 . He suggested that effective reduction in accidents could be obtained only by such means , through motor traffic being confined to a network of purpose-built roads without direct access . The areas thus bounded by through , or arterial , roads were named " precincts " . The same concept can be seen in the " environmental areas " of the Buchanan Report of 1963 . From the traffic safety and environmental viewpoint such an approach is clearly desirable ( although incorporating the new roads fur through traffic in existing urban areas can prove very costly and disruptive ) , but the need for good access within the areas thus defined for public transport and other services was often overlooked . The immediate post-war period in Britain was characterized by an expansion of the New Town concept , often stressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for public transport provision . The first generalion was built mainly around London ( such as Stevenage and Bracknell ) . This was followed by second generation , often in older industrial areas , accommodatng rehoused populations from older industrial cities ( such as Skelmersdale , near Liverpool ) . Public transport provision in such cases was often even worse , as road layouts were adopted which made through operation into housing areas very difficult . Ironically , most of the second generation towns were built in regions of exceptionally low car ownership and use . Access to railways for inter-urban travel was also poor . The 1960s also saw re-development of poor condition , high-density older Urban areas . Partly to provide replacement stock at high densities , the building of blocks of flats of up to twenty stories became popular , with results that are well known . The communal open space was not perceived in the same manner as gardens attached to individual houses , facilities for children were poor , and lifts unreliable . Growth of vandalism and crime - not entirely attributable to the physical design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the 1960s saw a reaction against " high-rise " , with a shift toward low-rise building , and rehabilitation of older housing stock . At the same time , many private schemes on the fringes of urban areas , or " adventitious " settlements in rural areas , were hull ( at successively lower average densities , making provision of public transpm services exceptionally difficult . The third generation of new towns , designed during the 1960s and now reaching maturity , has been strongly influenced by transport requirements , but in very different ways . Runcorn , with a population of about 80,000 , is laid out on a figure of eight pattern , which is followed by a high-capacity expressway for scneral traffic , and also , parallel with it ( hut passing through the centres of // neighbourhood units ) , a busway ( as described in Ch. 3 ) . By placing public transport on a segregated track , good penetration of the housing areas can be obtained , and a high average speed . Busways and bus links are also incorporated in Redditch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , designed almost exclusively around the private car . A grid road structure permits a spread of traffic over the network so that little congestion occurs , and penetration of the housing areas by public transport becomes very difficult , although alleviated to some degree by growth of minibus operation in the late 1980s . Design of public transport networks Stop and route spacing The total time for a one-way door-to-door trip comprises : ? walk to public transport stop or station ? wait for vehicle ? board vehicle ? vehicle accelerates to steady speed cycle repeated for ? vehicle runs at steady speed for each vehicle each intermediate ? vehicle decelerates to stop stop ? intermediate stop ? alight from vehicle ? walk to destination , or to an interchange point for further transport ride as part of a trip . For urban bus services , a simple average speed may be taken ( typically around 18km/h ) for the in-vehicle ride , varied according to traffic congestion and boarding time ( see Ch. 3 ) . For rail systems , where **25;1178;TOOLONG rates , and maximum running speed can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As shown in the appendix to this chapter , an expression can be derived for the components of total time listed above , incorporating speed and average length of line-haul trip , and vehicular characteristics . The line-haul part of the trip is that which takes place on the major public transport mode used . In conditions of fairly uniform population density along the whole route , with some con centration around stops or stations , the feeder trip length is equal to about one quarter of the average spacing between stops . For a given set of speeds , acceleration rates and trip lengths , the expression thus derived can be simplified to contain only one unknown quantity  --  the aver age stop spacing . If this were very small , total trip time would he high , since each passenger 's journey on the major mode would he interrupted by many inter mediate stops . On the other hand , if stop spacing were veto wide , feeder trip // times would lengthen , outweighing the benefits of a faster " line haul " section . By differentiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacing which minimizes total time can be calculated . Figure 5.2 shows such a case , for an average line-haul trip length of 5km , walking as the feeder mode ( at lm per second ) , and a vehicle with an accelera-tion rate of 1.0 m per second per second and steady speed of 12m per second . Trip time is minimized at a stop spacing of about 550 m . By substituting different values for each variable , trade-offs between them can be illustrated : I . If acceleration and/or retardation rates are increased , optimal stop spacing will narrow ( i.e. an intermediate stop imposes a smaller time penalty ) . If steady running speed attained after acceleration increases , optimal spacing will widen ( i.e. an intermediate stop will impose a greater time penalty ) . If the speed of the feeder mode is increased , optimal spacing will widen . .1 . If stop time is reduced , optimal spacing will narrow ( as for 1 ) . Many examples of these effects can be quoted . As Newell &; Vuchic ( 1968 ) have argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an urban rail sys- ( cm by park-and-ride substantially increases feeder trip speed , and hence optimal spacing becomes wider . us urban rail systems of the 1970s , such as the Linden-wold Line in Philadelphia , and BART in California , illustrate this trend . Where a more comprehensive local service is being provided , with most users gaining access on foot , then additional stations may be created , and the resultant delay to through passengers offset by using higher acceleration stock , as on the 1 ) ocklantls Light Railway in London . Where additional local stations have been adopted in areas served by diesel multiple units , as in West Yorkshire , there is iv ) NETWORK PLANNING some risk of journey times being increased as a result of the lower acceleration of such stock . Most urban flows are concentrated on the central area and hence loadings on buses or trains will be heaviest on the inner sections of radial routes . The penalty imposed by an additional intermediate stop to existing occupants will thus be greater the closer to the centre it is located . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catchment area may be much greater . When additions of this sort on existing networks are being evaluated , each must be considered on its own merits , to establish the overall trade-off in passenger time . Given the higher traffic densities on the inner sections of radial routes , limited-stop operation may be justified , with outer suburban services running nonstop through the inner suburbs - apart from selected interchanges - and a parallel local stopping service offered . This can be seen on most rail corridors into London , for example . In the case of bus services , limited-stop operation may be introduced to give an equivalent effect , as in the Timesaver services in the West Midlands . Limited-stop operation may also be sometimes justified on high-density inter-suburban corridors , as on the Uxbridge Road in west London . For the vast majority of local public transport services , walking is the access mode . The maximum convenient walk thus determines spacing between stops and between routes . For urban bus services , a typical upper limit of about 500m may be taken . Normally about 95% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest stop . The 1989/91 National Travel Survey shows that 88% of respondents were within 6 minutes ' walking time of a bus stop , and a further 8% within 7-13 minutes ' walk - furthermore , this includes rural residents . However , only 20% were within 13 minutes ' walk of a rail station ( NTS 1989/91 , p. 101 ) . A similar walking distance emerged from theoretical studies as part of the Runcorn New Town Master Plan . It corresponds to about 5 minutes ' walk for the average adult , but can take up to twice as long for someone with a pushchair or an elderly person . Passengers will also tend to walk to a stop in the " right " direction of travel , and not necessarily the closest one . From this , one can suggest that different network densities may be appropriate for different types of passenger . Peak school and work journeys can be handled on fairly widely spaced routes largely on main roads , offering high frequency and/or using large vehicles . At off-peak times , users may be much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hail &; ride " operation - picking up and setting down at any safe point , usually off main roads , and generally associated with minibus operation - has provided such a facility , of par titular benefit to those with heavy shopping or the elderly . It tends to be used more on the homeward journey than the outward trip , for which fixed stops still provide an easily understood point , at which information can also he displayed . In the case of railways , a wider stop spacing is adopted . Although accelera lion/retardation rates may be higher than for buses , intermediate stops incur a greater penalty , owing to higher running speeds , and higher energy consumption // ( see Ch. 4 ) . The capital and operating costs of stations are high , especially if requiring underground construction and/or staff on duty . A spacing of about 1,000m is typical of U-Bahn networks , falling toward 500m in city centres , and somewhat lower on light rail . Rail station spacing is also affected by the extent to which that mode is expected to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older parts of the Paris Metro , for example ) , or be supplemented by parallel buses for local movement ( as is generally the case in London ) . To a large extent , a wider rail station spacing is accepted by passengers ( partly reflecting the emphasis on work journeys ) . The average line-haul trip by rail tends to be greater than that by bus , and hence a longer feeder trip will be acceptable within the minimization of total trip time described above . A walking catchment radius up to about one kilometre may be assumed , although the prob-ability of being willing to do so falls off roughly in line with a normal distribution ( Fig. 5.3 ) . Such estimates have formed the basis for planning housing densities in Stockholm , in which the innermost zone around a station is reserved for the highest densities , the outermost for single-family dwellings . In London , how-ever , a survey in 1969 was unable to detect significant differences in willingness to walk within an 800-metre radius . The other main element in total journey time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliability . Its impact on demand may be incor-Ixtrated through use of a " service elasticity " as described in Chapter 2 . Use of smaller vehicles clearly enables higher frequencies to be offered , but at a higher cost per passenger . Waiting time may also be reduced by bus priority measures , as described in Chapter 3 , and its perceived effect by better information systems , as shown in chapters three and four . There are , however , two trade-offs between waiting time and network density outlined above . First , a wider spacing between routes and/or stops will give a ; realer density of traffic at each , and hence a higher frequency , for a given vehi-cle size , may be justified . Secondly , development of limited-stop services may o NETWORK PLANNING help to reduce in-vehicle time , but increase waiting time through the lower frequency offered at intermediate points . Route length and headway For purposes of illustration , this section is written largely in terms of bus operation , but similar considerations apply to railways . After selection of route and frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peak demand ( peak:interpeak service ratios are discussed further in Ch. 7 ) - a running time is derived from previous experience ( many new routes are in fact a restructuring of old ones rather than totally new road mileage ) or a sample of test runs . Where an existing section is incorporated , past data from automatic vehicle monitoring ( AVM ) systems , as described in Chapter 3 , may provide a much larger sample . The running time set should reflect conditions which vary by time of day and a desired level of reliability . Setting the mode or mean average time may result in many journeys not being able to cover the route within the scheduled time . Hence the return trip may also be late , and passenger waiting time greatly increased . It is far more realistic to assume a distribution of running times than a simple average , and set a proportion , such as 95% , which the schedule should cover . This may result in apparent inefficiency , as many buses and crews will spend longer at the terminal than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This approach was adopted on London route 220 ( Tooting-Willesden Junction ) , serving congested inner suburbs , where the same number of buses and crews was re-scheduled to allow more realistically for variations in running time , mainly by increasing lay-over time at terminals . Although the average scheduled frequency fell , actual average passenger waiting time was reduced by about 4% ( Weston 1982 ) . It should be noted that variability in running time is much less of a problem for railways , being unaffected by general congestion , and in any case needing to plan train paths with much greater precision . However slightly greater running time should be allowed at peak periods , owing to increased station dwell time , and delays at junctions . Rail timetables also allow a small recovery time in addition to the scheduled running time , to allow for minor delays . The number of vehicles and crews needed to work a service is equal to the round trip running time ( single-trip running time in each direction , plus lay-over at each end ) , divided by the proposed headway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip is 30 minutes each way , and if 5 minutes lay-over is allowed at each end , round-trip running time will be 70 minutes . If a 10-minute headway is operated , 70/10 , or 7 , buses will he needed . If a IS-minute headway were intended , then the number of buses estimated would he 1. h ( , ; in practice . 5 . DESIGN OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT NETWORKS This wastage becomes more serious the wider the headway , and the shorter the round trip time . It may be possible to interwork two routes at a common terminus so that the combined round-trip time is an integer multiple of headway : ? If the 15-minute headway were desired on the above route , it could be linked with one having a round-trip time of 35 minutes ( itself using 3 buses inefficiently , if also on a 15-minute headway ) . The combined round-trip time of 105 minutes divides by 15 to give exactly 7 buses . Alternatively , the original route could still be worked separately with a round-trip time increased to 75 minutes ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being used to increase layover ( with reliability benefits mentioned above ) , or to extend a short distance without extra buses being required . Another approach is to set the round trip time and number of vehicles , and then derive the headway : ? If 5 buses work a route with 70 minutes round-trip time , a headway of 14 minutes could be offered . However , the " clockface " headway ( one giving the same departures past each hour ) would be lost , making the service more difficult to follow for users and crews . Such an approach is only sensible where the headway is low enough for passengers to arrive at stops at random , rather than aiming for a specific departure ( typically about 12 minutes or less ) . The operator should aim to make best use of crew paid time . If drivers do no other work , then driving time per shift is to be maximized . This will be subject to legal constraints , under current UK domestic regulations for local services these being : ? maximum driving time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time per day : 10 hours 00 minutes ? minimum rest between shifts : 10 hours 00 minutes . The last limit effectively imposes a maximum range between the start and end of driving ( irrespective of the number of hours actually driven ) , if the same day 's duty is to be repeated the following day , of 14 hours . Within the paid work shift , time must also be allowed for signing on and signing off , as well as driving per se . In addition to " straight " shifts of continuous work apart from the break(s) , crews may also work " split " or " spreadover " shifts , i.e. in which two separate spells of driving are worked during the day , typically to cover the peak periods . Implications for costing of peak services are considered in Chapter 6 . In rail operations , trade-union agreements , rather than legal limits , generally set the crew scheduling constraints . Split-shift working is not generally practised , for example , although adoption of flexible rostering in recent years has enabled length of shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence increasing driving time per shift . 9 i NETWORK PLANNING Bus network planning methods So far as rail operations are concerned , a fairly systematic planning approach is clearly required , owing to the high cost of infrastructure and rolling stock . Even a change in the pattern of service on an existing network involves planning a year ahead to fit in train paths , connections , etc . In bus networks , much less formal planning may appear to be necessary , as little infrastructure is involved . In deregulated areas , only six weeks notice of service withdrawal or change is required . For certain types of change , an ad hoc approach may well be appropriate . Apart from determination of the schedule for crewing purposes as described above , passenger reaction may be gauged largely by monitoring use of the service once introduced , by use of ticket sales data and simple on-vehicle surveys . For example , varying the number of journeys on an existing route may be handled in this way , although a simple vehicle-km elasticity can be used to make an initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be applicable to new services directed at very specific markets , such as direct shoppers ' services to a new superstore , or the commuter coach services into London which have developed since the 1980 Transport Act . However , within a complex urban network , and/or where a radical restructuring of routes is taking place , such methods are not sufficient . Even on a simple , small-town network such as that shown in Figure 5.1 , many possible combinations of cross-centre linking , and combined headways on common sections of route , may be feasible . A series of ad hoc changes may identify some of these , but is unlikely to produce an optimal pattern . The operator may wish to assess the likely demand for new routes which do not serve a single well defined market , such as an all-day inter-suburb service . He/she may also wish to reassess running times over the network , and investigate the case for traffic management measures to assist buses . Comprehensive land-use transportation studies of the type described in Chapter 2 are not generally appropriate for this purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridors of demand and market share by mode at one period , but they soon become out of date . Zone sizes are usually too large to assign passengers clearly to specific routes , and household surveys based on too small a sample to give confidence in data for particular routes by time of day , etc . The LUTS approach is useful for major infrastructure planning , especially rail , but other methods are needed for detailed short-to-medium term planning . Two main techniques have been developed : ? Manual The first major example was the Market Analysis Project ( MAP ) , developed by the National Bus Company in conjunction with Buchanan and Partners in the mid-1970s , and applied on an area-by-area basis to most of its local bus network by the early 1980s , covering both town networks and adjoining rural areas ( see Ch. 8 ) . It was also applied to the National Express coach network ( Ch. 9 ) in 1978 80 as " ( ' oacliniap " , and to the Scottish l3us Group network as " Scotmap " in the early 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the network design process as such : computers were used from the start to collate and classify data for the network designer . Following developments in computer technology , QV Associates produced the BusDriver model ( able to work from microcomputers rather than mainframes ) in the mid-1980s ( MacBriar 1986 ) . ? Computer-based systems The major example is the Volvo Interactive Planning System ( vIPs ) , initially developed by Volvo Transportation Systems in Sweden , and applied in many other countries . Studies in Britain and South-East Asia have been undertaken by the MVA Consultancy . London Transport and West Midlands PTE used the system directly , under licence , LT subsequently developing its own system based on similar concepts . A refinement of the original system , known as vIPSII is now available . Both methods involve similar initial stages : 1 . The identification of network to be studied , not necessarily the whole network of one operator , but typically one focusing upon a market town or city centre , e.g. the Guildford area ( subject of an MAP scheme in 1980 which included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first application of vies in Britain ) , or part of a complex network within a large conurbation ( such as that based on Wandsworth within London , recast in 1991 ) . f ' 2 . Assessment of existing services in the area , including running times , frequency , peak vehicle requirement , etc. 3 . Extensive on-vehicle surveys to obtain a detailed picture of existing bus users , with exact origin and destination , extent of linked trips , journey purpose , etc . Patterns for different periods of the day are observed , as those in the peak may differ radically from shopping periods , or late evening . A sample covering all scheduled bus journeys within a short period ( such as one week ) is usually taken , and a high response rate obtained with simple self-completion forms , collected on-vehicle . The current survey adopted for this purpose in London is known as BODS ( bus origin and destination survey ) . 4 . This may be supplemented by additional background data , on market composition by age , sex , car availability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but generally a much smaller sample suffices . Household surveys may be used to collect attitude data , and trips by other modes . The data thus obtained is coded , edited and grossed-up to reflect total movements , making use of simple counts , etc . This process is far more reliable if carried out locally by the survey team who are familiar with the area and any problems encountered . For example , in the Scotmap work , on line terminals were installed in each company 's planning office into which data were entered directly , giving much better quality than in earlier MAP work in tvte ' , in which editing and coding was carried out centrally . The need for some supplementary surveys may be identified . // From this stage two methods differ . In MAP and its descendants , the computer was used to present data for zone-to-zone flows by time of day , and network planning was undertaken manually . In vies , and LT 's planning , the existing and proposed networks are represented in computer form . A route network analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links are assessed in terms of journey time , frequency , and extent of interchange . In vlPs , a direct demand model is calibrated for zone-to-zone flows , based on zonal data ( such as population and workplaces , as one would find in LUTS ) , and public transport service characteristics . The manual and computer-generated networks are developed , and evaluated using the RNA . Alternative cross-centre linkages and frequencies may then be evaluated . In the subsequent development of network planning by LT , a simplified approach has been adopted , in which existing demand is taken as the base , and variations which would result from changes in frequency and interchange ( applying established elasticities and interchange penalties ) are calculated , rather than modelling total demand as such . In both methods the planned network is then assessed by local management and may be subject to public consultation with local authorities and user groups ( this last aspect has virtually disappeared following deregulation in Britain , except in London where a different approach is adopted in any case , and some consultation is required by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and detailed scheduling work completed . Introduction of the new network is usually marked by extensive publicity , and sometimes adoption of a new fleet name or local marketing title , the latter being common in many NBC schemes of the late 1970s . Both systems enable a better matching of supply with demand , and hence either a better level of service without extra resources being required , or savings without substantial losses of traffic and revenue . Better crew and vehicle utilization ( especially in terms of passengers carried ) is obtained . The emphasis in most MAP schemes was on cost reduction while minimizing traffic losses , given the limited amount of financial support provided by non-metropolitan counties . Typically , peak vehicles were reduced by 25% , and mileage by 15-20% while revenue fell by only about 7% . The peak:interpeak ratio was lowered , and larger vehicles were used to handle school traffic . In Scotmap , traffic losses were less , and daytime off-peak services generally maintained or even improved . Following deregulation , comprehensive network planning has been largely abandoned . Operators make individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted by minibus conversion . However , while this has produced specific local innovations of value , the acute instability in the network is a major factor in loss of ridership . Competing behaviour by different operators in the same area does not necessarily produce an optimal overall network . Resources are likely to be concentrated on busier routes at busier times , often increasing frequency where it is already good , and giving little ridership growth in consequence . The separate provision of conuncrcial and tendered services also has the consequence of fragmenting nclwork planning . There is // strong evidence that many service changes are made , not in consequence of changes in passenger behaviour , or perceived opportunities to influence it , but in reaction to competing changes made by other operators . As indicated in Chapter 10 , the overall impact of the approach taken in London has been much more positive than the post-deregulation experience elsewhere , especially in the metropolitan areas . However , some scope still remains for making the centralized system more sensitive to local service improvement opportunities . Some of the London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been particularly active in pushing the midibus concept , for example . There may be scope for making the planning models more user-sensitive by segmenting the market by user type ( some users are far more sensitive to interchange penalties than others , for example ) . vIPSt1 offers refinements over the earlier techniques , notably in more realistic simulation of user behaviour in terms of choices made between routes of different service frequency and other characteristics serving the same catchment area ( Jansson 1992 ) . Applications of computers in scheduling As well as being used in network planning , computers are also used to assist in / " scheduling , traditionally a manual process . Two major packages are currently available , the Busman suite of Leeds University/Hoskyns , and Hastus suite developed at the University of Montreal , used largely in North America but now also in Britain . Commonly used elements in the Busman suite include TASC ( timetable and schedule compilation ) , which sets out the basic sequence of vehicle movements on an all-day service , and CREWPLAN which sets out the crew duties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manually or with computer assistance . In practice , the set of runs to be covered is not totally rigid . If , lirr example , the last run in the evening required an extra crew to be brought in , a manual scheduler would probably delete that journey from the timetable ( perhaps re-timing some others ) . This facility is incorporated in the CRUSCHED programme of Darby-Dowman and Mitra , which takes a given number of crews and bus journeys to be covered , then indicates which ( if any ) may not be feasible . The use of computer scheduling packages is unlikely to bring enormous savings ( although even small reductions in vehicles and crews needed will easily justify the cost of using them ) , but assists the manual scheduler by enabling many more options to be tested , and compensating for loss of skills as older schedulers retire . q7 NETWORK PLANNING Interchange Within an all-bus network some interchange will occur owing to the problem of dispersed demand for which through services can not be offered . Although a high proportion of passenger trips is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as vrns , there will always be some trips involving interchange , commonly including hospital visits , those to friends and relatives , and home-to-work journeys where the workplace is outside the central area or not large enough to be served by a special route . As populations become more dispersed , these trips will become relatively more important , even though public transport has a small share in these markets . Within larger cities , the proportion of bus trips involving bus-to-bus interchange grows , especially where separate services are required in the central area . Where rail networks are provided , some bus-to-rail interchange may occur spontaneously to save time , and may be encouraged by through-ticketing , clear information , etc . Interchange between urban and long-distance modes is also important . In modelling of flows using generalized cost as a measure of deterrence ( see Ch. 2 ) , interchange may be represented by a time penalty ( i.e. over and above observed interchange time ) of about 5 minutes ( a range from about 2 to 10 minutes ) . However , this is highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . Systems such as Stockholm and Hamburg have succeeded in stimulating high levels of public transport use , despite the high proportion of interchange ( generally bus/rail ) involved . The high proportion of passengers using travelcards clearly assists in this , and the very rapid take-up of London 's Travelcard from May 1983 ( in a network with a high proportion of interchange ) also illustrates its attractiveness to users in such circumstances . Some 70% of London bus travellers now use travelcards , bus passes , or concessionary passes . This makes it easier to plan networks with a higher element of interchange ( for example , shortening very long routes to offer improved reliability on each section ) than in cases where the majority of passengers would incur a financial penalty under a cash-paid fare system . Interchanges themselves form another criterion for station location , especially where a new rail route is added to an existing network : on London 's Victoria Line all stations but one are interchanges with other rail routes . If interchange penalties can be minimized , then systematic substitution of linehaul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slow , unreliable and costly bus operation on inner sections of congested radial roads can be replaced by reserved-track rapid transit , being less labour-intensive and of higher quality . The outer sections of bus routes are then converted to rail feeders . The cost aspects of such a process are illustrated as a break-even chart in Figure 5.4 . So far as the operator is concerned , the fixed-cost element may have been met largely by central or local government grants ( whose justification would also have rested on estimated time savings to users , increased traffic , etc. ) . 98 The main example of such an integrated network in Britain prior to local bus deregulation was that in Tyne and Wear , where the Metro was opened in stages from 1980 to 1984 . Buses were converted to feeder services through purpose-built interchanges such as those at Regent Centre and Heworth . Overall , the sys-tem proved successful in retaining a high level of public transport use despite other adverse trends . However , there were problems when all bus passengers were required to transfer to rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the case at Gateshead , where bus/rail interchange occurs within 1.5km of the centre of Newcastle , and through bus services were offered once again after deregulation . However , many of the other bus feeder services to Metro interchanges have been retained since deregulation , and even some of those at Gateshead reintroduced . Elsewhere in Britain , parts of conurbations have bus/rail integration of this sort , where convenient interchanges can be made onto railways with good cen-tral-area penetration ( e.g. the Birmingham ? Longbridge corridor , or the role of purpose-built interchanges at Bury and Altrincham , which now serve the Man-chester Metrolink ) . In other major European cities , integrated bus/tram/rail net-works are the norm . Typically , through bus services are provided within a radius of about 5 km of the centre , with an outer bus network feeding rail interchanges : this is the pattern in Paris , for example . Mu , ? central area trips Some trips of this type arc handled along existing radial corridors into the central area , their origins and destinations both being within the same corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a main road , or a school similarly sited . A tendency for households to relocate outwards along the same corridor assists this . Linking of radial routes across a city centre can also assist , as can easy interchange within the central area between radial routes . However , congestion within the centre can deter the former , since unreliability would thus spread more extensively through the network . In many cases , however , use of radial routes for suburb-to-suburb trips would be highly inconvenient , and specialized services will be needed . Since these will generally be of low frequency ( typically half-hourly or worse ) , adherence to schedule is essential , and timetabled connections between such services ( and radials ) essential . The Canadian concept of the timed transfer focal point , at which several services converge on a centre at fixed intervals , takes this one step further . In a small town , this approach can be applied to the whole network . Within suburban areas , it is helpful if land uses such as office employment , shops , health centres etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interchanges , such as the Broadway development at Hammersmith . Park &; ride ( P &R); The private car can also be used as a feeder mode to public transport , generally rail in large cities . It is particularly important in low-density suburbs of large cities , where local bus services are thin , and much housing beyond walking distance to the station , yet the railway is an attractive mode for the radial trip to the city centre . Some spontaneous development has occurred , but to an increasing extent P &R; is being encouraged through provision by transport operators or local authorities of car parks at stations . Many of these are former railway goods yards , especially around London , not ideally shaped or sited . However , new sites have also been developed , and for long-distance travel specialized Parkway stations such as Bristol , have been built almost exclusively for this mode . Motorists tend to " railhead " , i.e. drive fairly close in to the city centre , before transferring to rail , rather than driving to the nearest station . This tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the point of transfer can be placed as far as possible from the central area along a rail route , the financial position of the operator will generally improve , and fewer problems of on-street parking and traffic congestion caused by cars in inner areas . A certain amount of time ( or cost ) saving is usually required to offset the perceived interchange penalty ( see above ) . Unless there are severe physical or price restraints , voluntary diversion is unlikely for trips of less than about 6km . Generally speaking , one would not expect significant P &R; demand within cities of less than about 500,000 people , as most trips would be under this length , and rail or rapid transit systems are not provided . Within Britain , most P &R; use is found // in London and the metropolitan areas . In some cases , such as the West Midlands , free parking is provided : this can be justified by the reduction in traffic congestion thus obtained . There are , however , some exceptions . Where parking is very limited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the Saturdays leading up to Christmas , bus park &; ride may be attractive . Many towns run pre-Christmas t ' &R; bus services to supplementary car parks . In others all-year-round Saturday shopping services are operated . In Oxford , where the historic city centre imposes limits on road space and parking , and buses enjoy very good access through priority measures ( see Ch. 3 ) all-day P &R; services were established in 1974 : 3,000 parking spaces are now provided at three sites , with plans to expand to 5,000 . Bus park &; ride has also expanded in similar historic cities , such as Chester and York . Some schemes are now financed through TSB , and government support has also been evident in allocation of credit approvals for P &R; schemes . The future of park-and-ride has four aspects : ? A means of enabling existing car trips originating in low-density , or poorly served areas , to transfer to public transport ( normally rail ) without the need to provide additional feeder services . ? Catering for further dispersal of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , the intercity station at Stevenage serves the north Hertfordshire area . /1 ? A means of enabling restrictions on car use in town centres , for traffic congestion or environmental reasons , to be implemented . Demand from dispersed origins may be concentrated at one or a few points . In addition to examples already quoted , St Ives in Cornwall restrains summer visitors ' cars for environmental reasons . A P &R; scheme was set up in 1978 on the branch line from St Erth , used by several hundred cars per day . ? On new suburban rail routes , the optimal spacing between stations could increase if a high proportion of feeder trips were by car ( see the argument given earlier in this chapter ) . A variant on P &R; is " kiss &; ride " in which the commuter is driven to the station by their partner , so that all-day parking is not required . In new interchanges , parking areas specifically for this purpose may be designated . Its pattern of use is often asymmetric - for example , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening , when a feeder bus may be used instead . Public transport in low-density situations Variations in traffic level are handled mainly by changing service frequency . Network density may also he varied by not running some routes at certain periods , and/or a simplified network at certain periods such as evenings and Sundays . This reaches its extreme ( in urban areas ) in skeletal all-night bus networks // operated in cities such as London . Limited-stop services may be confined to busier periods only , their vehicles augmenting intermediate stopping services at other times . These problems are , of course , particularly acute in rural areas , considered separately in Chapter 8 . Where a mixture of minibus and full-size operation is found in the same network , minibuses and single-deckers may be deployed to cover almost all evening and Sunday work , thus enabling a similar route structure to be offered throughout the week , but at lower cost . The smaller vehicles may also be particularly appreciated in terms of passenger security when small loads are carried . The alternative of less direct routeings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the absence of limited-stop workings , will of course result in longer journey times for some passengers , but these will be offset by a higher frequency than might otherwise be the case . Loadings are likely to be low , and higher scheduled speeds may be set when there is little traffic congestion . The " dial a ride " concept was introduced during the 1970s , offering variable routeing in defined area , responding to requests by phone , in writing ( normally a standing order for a regular trip ) , or on boarding the vehicle . Minibuses of about 16 seats were generally used . Telephone requests were handled by a radio control centre , sometimes making real-time use of computers to plan minimumtime routes . The very high unit cost per passenger which resulted made these services difficult to justify as general public services , and have all now been withdrawn , although a few similar services continue to operate elsewhere in Europe , where higher levels of support are generally given . In Britain , the dial-a-ride concept has been adopted for specialized demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to carry wheelchairs . Examples include the local dial-a-ride networks within London , " Ring &; Ride " in Manchester , and Readibus in Reading . Despite the failure of dial-a-ride as a general purpose mode , there has been considerable expansion of radio-controlled single-hirer taxis . In some other countries taxis are used as planned substitutes for conventional buses at times of low demand , notably some evening/ all-night services in West German cities . The legalization of shared-taxi operation in Britain since 1986 should have made this sort of mixed-mode operation much easier , but there has been little impact to date . Conclusion The process of matching supply to demand through design of the appropriate network structure has become much more systematic in recent years through the adoption of extensive passenger surveys with computer-assisted planning techniques . However , the pattern of land use has major effects on the ability of public transport to provide a good level of service , and public transport planners and operators should seek to influence it where change csvptes such opportunities . // Appendix : A technique for determining optimal interstation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ( page 88 ) , the notation as : average line-haul trip per passenger ( metres ) D average interstation spacing ( metres ) station stop time ( seconds ) A distance covered by train in accelerating to normal running speed , and in retardation from normal running speed ( symmetrical speed/time curve assumed ) ( metres ) B time occupied in same process as ( A ) ( seconds ) steady running speed of vehicle or train ( metres/second ) F average speed of feeder mode to station ( metres/second ) T average feeder trip length from origin ( metres ) to station ( as a working approximation , take T as equal to 0.25D ) Some behavioural studies have suggested that passengers experience losses while walking and waiting equal to about twice the average valuation of travel-ling time . The component for feeder trip time could on this argument be multi-plied by two if walking were the feeder mode . Waiting time is a function of service frequency and thus is not affected directly by spacing . It is therefore not considered in this calculation , but walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time = feeder trip time ( x 2 ) + ( number of intermediate station stops x station stop time ) + ( number of interstation runs x acceleration and deceleration time ) + ( number of interstation runs x time on each run at steady speed ) In the expression as shown , stop time at the station where the passenger boards the train or vehicle is included , since normally s/he would arrive before the train or vehicle stopped . The values of A and B are calculated for given rates of acceleration and maximum running speed . In this example the following values are assumed : * Based on a constant **25;1205;TOOLONG rate of 1.0m per second per sec-Inserting the values into the equation above we obtain , A NETWORK PLANNING The values inserted are typical of an urban light railway fed entirely by walk-ing trips , and station stop time is an average for stock with sliding doors .

In the case of bus operation , stop time can be represented as a constant , which for a one-man bus is about four seconds , plus a time per boarding passenger . The latter ranges from about two seconds on systems with simple fare scales and no change-giving up to about six seconds . The boarding time related to the number of passengers could be regarded as a constant total and only the four-second period be included in the optimal spacing calculation . In the long run , however , stop spacing will itself affect demand , and hence total delay caused by boarding passengers . ( Widening the stop spacing would cut out some short trips , but encourage more long-distance ones , and vice versa . ) References and suggested further reading Jansson , K. &; B.

Developments specific to public transport are described , with reference to other texts for general theory . The basic structure of costs is examined , followed by methods of allocating costs to specific activities , highlighting the contrast between fully allocated approaches and those based on determining avoidable , or escapable , costs . Some simple relationships between costs and prices are discussed in Chapter 7 , followed by pricing techniques based on user perception . Particular emphasis is given to recent changes in pricing structures , of which traditional economic theory takes little account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocation of revenues as well as the more traditional emphasis on costs . The structure of costs ( ' I , tcsification The costs involved in a transport operation may be classified in three ways : I. According to inputs . Groupings such as wages and salaries , other staff-related costs ( National Insurance , pensions , etc. ) , energy , spares and materials , insurance , depreciation , rent and interest charges indicate the main inputs and their relative importance . For example , in countries such as Britain the staff-related costs comprise about 70% of the total , but energy only about 5% to 10% . This type of classification is useful in highlighting the importance of different inputs and hence likely future trends : thus change in real labour costs is likely to be the predominant factor in determining overall rates of // change ( in the absence of productivity change ) , rather than that in energy costs . 2 . According to the activity within the transport operation . For example , in analyzing bus operators ' costs , the following classification based on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accountancy ) has been found helpful : - traffic operating costs - drivers , conductors and supervisory staff , ticket equipment , uniforms , miscellaneous supplies - fuel and power - servicing , repairs and maintenance - staff costs , materials and spares , maintenance of buildings , machinery , etc. - management , welfare and general - administration , insurance , welfare and medical facilities , etc. - ( interest , taxation and depreciation are treated separately ) . The advantage of this type of classification is that it highlights the relative importance of certain types of activity within the organization . Although similar in some respects to the input classification above , it gives a more useful guide to where costs arise . For example , it can be shown that the cost structure for urban bus operators in Britain changed during the late 1970s as one-person-operation became widespread . Traffic operating costs were thus held down as conductors were lost , falling from 62% of total operating costs in 1975-6 to 57% in 1979-80 , while servicing , repairs and maintenance rose from 23% to 26% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-deckers replaced simpler front-engine types , and operators failed to reduce the scale of their workshops in line with falling fleet size ( Higginson &; White 1982 ) . From deregulation in 1986 , sharp reductions in labour costs have been made , especially in maintenance and administrative staff ( see further comment in Ch. 10 ) , with smaller cuts in driving staff costs . This is consistent with the evidence for scope in cost reduction prior to 1986. 3 . According to their basis of variation , and escapability over time . Table 6.1 shows the main elements identified in the CIPFA/NBC classification developed in the early 1970s . Note that variation by time is much more important than variation by distance , reflecting the major role of time-based labour costs in the total . Peak vehicle based costs are those associated with all vehicles required to cover service at peak periods , not merely those used only at such times . The examples above have been drawn in terms of the bus industry . Compains . THE STRUCTURE OF COSTS rable examples for railways in ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminals , and rolling stock maintenance . In ( 3 ) , variation of cost by traffic density would represent a major factor . For the bus and coach operator , life is much simpler in that a public road network is used , to which a contribution may be made through annual vehicle duty and fuel duty , whereas the railways , in providing their own infrastructure , also face the problem of allocating their costs to specific activities . Interest and depreciation In general , interest and depreciation are treated separately from the categories of operating cost described above . This is not to deny their importance , but to acknowledge their different nature , being often dependent upon accounting conventions and historic conditions as much as current operating methods . Depreciation This is the process of setting aside funds during the life of an asset , such that it call he replaced by an equivalent asset without additional capital being required . Transport operators generally use the straight line method , in which the assumed life of an asset is divided into its cost to give a sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs ? 75,000 and has a life of 15 years , then the annual depreciation charge would be ? 75,000/15 , or ? 5,000 per year . An alternative is the reducing-balance method , in which the same percentage of the initial cost is set aside each year . For example , at 20% , ? 15,000 would be set aside in the first year , ? 12,000 ( i.e. 20% of ? 60,000 ) in the second , and so on . This method is appropriate to those assets which may depreciate more rapidly in the first few years of their lives , and be resold for further use elsewhere . However , even in the coach sec-tor , to which this does apply , the straight-line method is generally preferred . If there were no inflation , then the historic price of the asset would generally be sufficient as a basis for depreciation . However , in practice the money thus set aside is inadequate for funding the replacement . Under such conditions , either additional capital molt be raised to make up the difference ( through equity or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the sum set aside each year is adjusted in the light of inflation , so that the final total is sufficient to replace the asset at current prices . This approach also formed part of the concept of current cost accounting ( ecA ) . During the 1970s and early 1980s it was encouraged in the public sector - for example , in the National Bus Company - but was not generally followed in the private sector . It has now been largely dropped , in favour of reversion to the historic cost method . The effect of relying on historic cost depreciation is that only the monetary value of assets is retained , and a serious danger of failing to make necessary replacement investment will arise . The lives used for depreciation purposes correspond roughly to those found in practice , but may vary according to accounting conventions , treatment of depreciation and profits in company taxation , leasing , etc . For buses and coaches 8 to 15 years is common , but for rail vehicles up to 30 to 40 years . Certain assets may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most infrastructure , such as embankments , bridges or tunnels ( whether road or rail ) , where periodic heavy maintenance and occasional rebuilding is adopted rather than complete replacement . A critical point may be reached when a major structure needs replacing , the subsequent additional investment then raising the question of whether the route should be abandoned . From 1992/3 , British Rail changed its accounting basis by charging to capital some costs previously treated as current , notably on track and infrastructure renewal . The growth of leasing in recent years also raises complications . In " operating leases " an annual charge is made by the lessor to the operating company ( sometimes also including maintenance of the vehicle ) , and the assets are not shown on the balance sheet , nor in depreciation . In " finance leases " , the assets do appear on the balance sheet , and depreciation may be provided . This practice has been adopted to some degree in the bus and coach industry , and is becoming significant in the railways following privatization , in which leasing companies take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the supply of all new stock is likely to be on this basis . Interest These charges are often influenced by the capital structure of the business and historical factors rather than the current assets employed . Publicly owned businesses have generally been financed through fixed-interest loans , interest on which has been treated as a " cost " . Conversely , a private company financed entirely through equity - or dividend - capital , would not incur such a " cost " , but be able to regard all its surplus after covering operating costs , depreciation , and taxation , as " profit " . Thus , in comparing profitability of businesses one should assess carefully their capital structure . In addition to bearing fixed interest , much of the capital in public sector operations was repayable , imposing a further cost burden on the operator that would not be faced with equity capital . However , in some cases , the historic capital debt has been wholly written off . // London Transport and its subsidiaries have virtually no fixed-interest debt . For railways , interest charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very high charge indeed , and very few meet this requirement ( the inten-tion to do so for the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway is virtually unique among urban systems ) . The requirement for Railtrack to provide a return on its assets may greatly increase the apparent rail subsidy in Britain ( no equivalent valuation is attached to the road network , funded purely out of current revenues ) . Within the bus industry in Britain , NBC and SBG were funded wholly from repayable fixed-interest debt . Since privatization , individual bus companies now have an clement of equity capital , but in many cases ( especially management buy-outs ) , a substantial proportion is in the form of fixed-interest borrowing . Since compa-nies were often sold for more than their share of total NBC or SBG debt , they may in many cases face a similar or even higher debt burden than before . Table 6.2 Effects of varying assumptions on vehicle replacement and capital struc-lure , for a small bus company ( f million per annum ) . 1 A ( COSTING AND COST ALLOCATION METHODS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by equity capital of ? 150,000 . As can be seen , by varying these assumptions , the net profit can range from ? 0.22m to ? 0.02m per annum , for the same operating performance . The rate of return on the initial investment ranges from 16.3% to 1.5% . In the absence of replacement depreciation accounting as such the difference between historic and replacement costs could be reflected in provision of a separate account for this purpose . Another approach is to set a profit target as a percentage of turnover , to provide for the difference between historic and replacement depreciation , and to give a realistic rate of return on equity capital . For example , the Stagecoach Group have set a target of 15% . Cost allocation methods From this point , the specific features of the bus and rail industries make it appropriate to discuss costing techniques separately . Bus industry Until the early 1970s , the general approach in Britain was to estimate a total average cost per bus mile , by dividing total costs ( all operating costs , and usually depreciation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicator is still produced ( on a kilometre basis ) , and serves to describe trends . However , it is most unsatisfactory as a means of comparing costs between routes within a network , or between operators , since it is clear that most costs do not vary with distance , but with time . Demands for support to rural services made to county councils resulted in a questioning of cost allocation methods . This led to the formulation of the NBC/CIPFA system , Standard unit costs for each cost centre ? typically a depot ? were derived for driver hours , fuel and tyre costs per vehicle mile , depreciation per peak vehicle , etc . Table 6.3 gives an example based on a fairly typical allocation of costs under the CIPFA system , where the cost centre is a single depot , running urban and rural services . The grouping of costs in Table 6.3 slightly simplifies that in Table 6.1 , by placing " variable " and " semi-variable " into one category , and grouping fixed costs at depot level ( local administration , building maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central administration , fixed interest charges ) , but enables the principal features of the CIPFA system and its underlying assumptions to be illustrated . Maintenance costs are treated on a distance basis . For purposes of calculation , a bus life of 15 years is assumed . Depreciatio is on a straight-line basis , at current replacement values , allocated to each sec ( urban or rural ) in proportion to the number of vehicles owned . Fixed de // // These contrasts by vehicle type have become more marked with the rapid growth of minibuses . Where a lower wage rate applies ( typically 20% less than for full-size vehicles ) , minibuses in urban service will incur about 70% to 75 % the total cost per bus-kilometre of full-size vehicles ( other factors being the lower fuel and maintenance costs per kilometre and slightly higher average speed which may be attained ) . For example , if minibus cost per kilometre is 70% that of full-size buses , then doubling the service frequency ( a 100% increase in buskm ) would increase total costs by only 40% , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in ridership of 40% would match the increase in costs , corresponding to a demand elasticity with respect to service level of +0.40 . The cost per passenger space-km is of course greater for minibuses than full-size vehicles ( by about 50% ) , but given the low average load factors found on many conventional services , such a substitution is feasible . Peak cost allocation Another respect in which average unit costs are inappropriate is in peak/off-peak cost allocation . Not only are certain vehicles only used at peak times , making it appropriate to allocate their costs entirely to that period , but also the crew utilization on peak-only duties may be poor . Suppose that , within the urban operations shown in the initial data , 8 of the 24 PVR operate only in the peak period , some 4 hours per day , Monday to Friday , each covering 64km . Their crews perform no other work , and result in time-based variable costs of ? 42.00 per working day . If we assume that 10 buses are owned in total to cover the peak-only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations incur an average cost of ? 2.10 per kilometre . If the revenue from them was ? 1.21 , a loss of ? 0.89 per kilometre would be incurred . This implies a much greater cross-subsidy from other traffic than in the urbanrural case above . Although the average revenue - at the same rate per kilometre as over the day as a whole - may seem rather low for the peak-only services , one should bear in mind that they are often loaded in one direction only , and that much of the extra peak traffic in many towns comprises school-children ( see Ch. 2 ) , who may pay substantially lower fares . The peak/off-peak cost allocation issue was examined in greater depth by CIPFA , and an improved method of cost allocation introduced . Nonetheless , it does highlight the contrast between cost allocation methods and those which determine avoidable costs . Even if an average unit cost per driver-hour for the peak-only buses were derived , this would be a poor guide . One peak-only bus might be covered by a driver who also drives on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in this case it would not be reasonable to allocate his/her whole shift to the peak . Conversely , an off-peak journey might be added to the service , covered by a driver currently employed for the peak only within his guaranteed shift , hence with a very low avoidable cost . As a basis fota " fair " allocation between routes , the CIPFA system certainly represented ag improvement on previous methods , and a good Will for negotiating with loc .. , . , iiiaiiiiiiiaahu. , COST ALLOCATION METHODS Table 6.4 shows the composition of British Rail 's total costs in 1992/93 . It can Pe seen that the categories of train crew , fuel &; electricity , shunting , etc. , and rolling stock maintenance ( totalling 36.6% ) correspond broadly to those found the bus industry , with similar issues of allocation arising - for example , the t of peak-only services . However , over half the total costs are not related to n operation as such , but terminals ( a term covering all stations and depots ) , k and signalling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viz COSTING AND COST ALLOCATION METHODS Allocating these to specific traffic flows becomes difficult and often arbitrary , despite attempts to improve this process over many years . One such was the " Cooper formula " , used under the Transport Act 1968 until 1974 inclusive , to estimate the grants required for specific loss-making services . Although train service costs could be allocated to routes fairly clearly , allocation of terminal , track and signalling costs over common sections of route was arbitrary . They may be apportioned on some common basis , such as gross tonne-kilometres ( for track and signalling ) , or number of passenger movements ( for terminals ) , but these are very crude . For example , wear and tear on the track itself may be correlated with gross tonne-kilometres , but is also associated with the maximum axle-loads ( usually greater for freight stock ) and maximum speeds ( usually greater for passenger services ) over the section in question . Cost and complexity of signalling is determined by the headway between trains , mix of speeds ( see Ch. 9 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Comparing the attributed revenue with the allocated costs for such traffic often resulted in misleading choices . For example , a freight service sharing track with passenger trains might well fail to cover its share of allocated costs , yet withdrawing that service might bring about very little reduction in track or signalling costs . If the freight service covered at least its specifically attributable costs , then it could be worth retaining . Likewise , an off-peak passenger service might be improved at low marginal cost , making better use of existing track and train crews , yet appear not worthwhile owing to the higher share of track , signalling and terminal costs which it might attract . In recognition of these problems , the Railways Act 1974 abolished the specific grants for passenger services , replacing them with the Pso payment for the passenger network as a whole ( see Ch. 1 ) , and the payments from PTEs . However , the shift was a somewhat extreme one , making assessment of costs other than at a national level rather difficult . The period from 1974 saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " avoidable cost " concept . Each activity was required to make " contribution " to track , signalling and terminal costs based on those costs , together with covering its train operating costs . The " contribution " was based on the difference between attributed income and expenditure , after allowing for specifically attributable costs . However , this system left a very large proportion of costs not allocated to any specific activity . It was followed by the development of sector management ( see Ch. 1 ) in which financial targets were set for sectors based on InterCity passenger , and Network South East passenger , Regional passenger , Freight and Parcels sectors . In order to avoid the problem of arbitrary cost allocation described above , a specific sector was deemed to be the " Prime User " of a common resource , other sectors being required to meet only their specifically avoidable costs . In general , passenger traffic was regarded as the prime user of the system ( reflecting the fact that it accounts for the majority of revenue , and Justification for financi COST ALLOCATION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger routes , the InterCity sector was the prime user , bearing responsibility for track , signalling and terminal costs . Other sectors making use of these facilities were charged only those costs specific to them . Thus , a local passenger service sharing an InterCity route would be charged its train operating costs , together with those of additional intermediate stations , signalling for closer-headway operation , etc. , but InterCity would bear the great majority of track and signalling costs . The concept worked much better than previous fully allocated systems , but suffered from the somewhat arbitrary definition of " Prime User " . If it were proposed that an existing freight line be used to carry a new local passenger service also , then the passenger service would by definition become the " Prime User " of the track and signalling , and thus bear many costs now attributed to the freight sector . This could deter the re-opening , even if the revenue and other benefits of the proposed passenger service exceeded the avoidable costs of its introduction . A related problem occurred when some train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly specific to a single sector ) ? for exampie , parcels and InterCity passenger services , or locomotives shared between passenger and freight operations . It has been the general intention of central government since the mid-1970s that freight and InterCity services should cover their costs ( howsoever defined ) from revenue , with the pso and PTE payments directed largely toward other pas/senger services . InterCity and freight sectors have been required to also make a specified rate of return on current assets employed . During the 1980s , the " prime user " concept was replaced by the " sole user " concept . This followed the same hierarchy of allocation by sector , but took a " bottom up " instead of " top down " approach i.e. instead of allocating the existing costs , it considered what resources were required to run the pattern of services currently offered . For example , an InterCity service might need a basic twotrack main line maintained for high speeds . Additional freight traffic would impose higher axle loads , and possibly the need for specific sidings and loops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermediate stations , and the need for extra block sections , and perhaps require additional parallel tracks . The sum of these requirements could then be compared with infrastructure currently provided ( which might include , for example , redundant freight loops ) . The method thus pointed the way toward reducing infrastruc'lure costs . The completion of " Organizing for Quality " in 1992 placed specific portions f track and signalling infrastructure under specific sectors , giving a closer link tween managerial responsibility and costs incurred . COSTING AND COST ALLOCATION METHODS Comparative rail and bus costs Some crude comparisons between rail and bus costs may be made by dividing total system costs ( including track , signalling and other infrastructure costs ) by train-kilometres run . Such averaging gives an indication of the much higher costs incurred per train-kilometre than for bus , and hence the difference in average loads required to break even . Table 6.5 shows some examples , together with averages for bus services . The much higher rail figures are influenced by differences between train and bus size , and of course the inclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger services on the BR system may also exaggerate some of the differ-ences ) . It can be seen that unit costs in the London case tend to be higher than elsewhere , both for rail and bus , although this is not necessarily true of unit cost per passenger-kilometre , due to the much higher loadings attained , for both modes . The Tyne &; Wear Metro clearly attains the lowest urban rail operating costs , probably due to high staff productivity , and treatment of capital costs . Even if " track costs " for buses were included , on the basis of calculations shown in Transport Statistics Great Britain 1993 ( p. 56 ) , this would only increase bus costs by about 6p per vehicle-kilometre . STATISTICAL MODELS OF COST STRUCTURES The average charges imposed by Railtrack for 1994/5 are also shown . These approach total average costs in 1992/3 , and are clearly much greater than the sum of infrastructure-related costs shown in Table 6.4 , even allowing for inflation . A major factor is that Railtrack 's assets have been valued at a replacement cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.6% is initially required ( i.e. ? 364 million per year ) , later rising to 8% ; further comment on this issue is made in Chapter 10 . Statistical models of cost structures In addition to the procedures for allocating cost categories to activities described above , statistical relationships can also be established between variables , and the resultant models used for purposes of allocation , or forecasting . In the latter they may provide a quick method of estimating costs of proposed service changes without carrying out a detailed analysis from the start . Thus a regression model for bus costs , incorporating bus-km , bus-hours and peak vehicle requirement could be used to estimate total cost of alternative service provisions , prior to more detailed assessment of preferred options . Modelling of costs has been used in rail systems to establish relationships /between traffic density and unit costs ( especially in track and signalling ) and to ' test whether overall economies of scale by network size exist . Fairly strong relationships with traffic density may be found but an uncertain picture remains on the question of economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . There remains the danger that the variables included in the model themselves simply reflect judgements by engineers or accountants rather than fundamental relationships . For example , various standards of track maintenance are often set , associated with traffic density , based on engineers ' judgement . These in turn will he associated with different levels of cost . A modeller would thus establish a relationship between costs and traffic density , but this may be a rather circular process . Improvements have been made recently however , notably the " MARI'AS " model of BR ( Hope 1992 ) . Within the bus industry , modelling exercises have been carried out to test whether economies of scale by fleet size exist . They have generally confirmed the earlier work of Lee &; Stedman ( 1970 ) , suggesting no economies of scale . Indeed , diseconomies may exist , although it is difficult to distinguish the effects of large fleet size from features of large conurbations such as greater traffic congestion and higher wage levels , the size of operator and size of city served often being correlated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ density may be found ( Windle 1988 ) . Although bus operators do not incur the fixed costs of infrastructure applicable to rail , in both modes higher traffic density permits larger vehicles to be used , and/or higher load factors to be obtained , thus reducing cost per passenger carried . 117 // Pricing theory and practice Introduction One starting point in pricing policy is to establish links between prices and costs . An operator seeking to break even or make a small profit is taken as the initial case , with some simple average costing approaches described . However , provided that revenue at least exceeds the variable , or escapable , cost associated with a particular facility , it will be worth retaining , at any rate in the shortmedium run . Simple average cost-price relationships should therefore be co , ered only as a guide to the principles involved . The costs which an operator has to meet from passenger revenue will upon conditions already described . In addition to current operating cos% elation will have to be covered ( historic or replacement ) , and interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taxes and su will also affect the " total costs " as perceived by the operator . For example , Britain local bus services receive a rebate of most fuel duty , but in other COWtries fuel may carry a high rate of tax . The New Bus Grant , until 1984 , partly offset the cost of replacing vehicles . The term " revenue " may also be ambiguous . In addition to fares paid by passengers , this will also include income from advertising , work for outside bodies by engineering workshops , etc . Payments in compensation for concessionary fares offered to certain groups of passengers at the request of local authorities - the elderly , disabled , and in some cases children - are normally regarded by operators as " revenue " rather than " subsidy " , especially as the aim of current policy is to ensure that the operator does not receive revenue totalling more than would have been obtained ( after allowing for any specific extra costs ) at the existing level of fares . Thus , if one divides total revenue ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger-kilometres ( km ) to get an average unit revenue , this figure may overstate considerably the average cost as perceived by the passenger . Unit revenues will also be affected by the mix of traffic ( cash fares , travelcards , off-peak fares , child fares , etc. ) , and , where graduated fare scales apply , by changes in trip length over time . Rather than talking of an " average fare " ( an almost meaningless concept ) , it is better to use the term " average revenue per trip " , whichY the sense that revenue received will vary accord -- 119
