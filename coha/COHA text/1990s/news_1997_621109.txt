<p> If you 've always wanted to run a high-tech firm , this may be the perfect time to make a bid for the CEO job of your dreams . <p> Executive recruiters and venture capitalists say so many new companies have been started in the last two years that the executive talent pool is nearly dry , forcing companies large and small to look longer and harder for the right person . <p> The shortage means that more companies are having to settle for their second or third choice . Some firms come to a standstill while awaiting a leader . And some ventures ca n't even get financed because there may not be anyone to run them . <p> " The explosion of Internet startups has created the largest vacuum of executive talent Silicon Valley has every seen , " said David Beirne , a headhunter who recently became in-house talent scout for Benchmark Capital , a venture firm in Menlo Park . <p> Bill Unger , partner with the Mayfield Fund , another venture capital firm , said prudent investors are becoming leery of financing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to find chief executives who have the proven ability to turn an idea into a company . <p> " We have more than $ 5 billion flowing into venture capital funds and too much money is chasing the good deals , " Unger said . " Where do you get the experienced managers who you will trust with your wallet , or if you 're an entrepreneur , who you 'll trust with your dream . " <p> Although startups have the toughest time recruiting scarce talent , large firms , especially those in trouble , are also finding it hard to get someone to sit where the buck stops . <p> " Apple Computer is a perfect case in point , " said David Nosal , managing partner of the Korn/Ferry recruiting firm in San Francisco . " The really great candidates , the people with the horsepower to turn around an Apple , are literally being called four times a week by guys like me . They do n't have to take big risks " by jumping to a troubled company like Apple . <p> Apple this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interim CEO . <p> Charlie Marshall , an investor and co- founder of several startups , said the it 's taking twice as long as it used to to fill CEO positions . <p> " The rule of thumb used to be that it took 90 to 120 days to do a CEO search , " Marshall said . " But nowadays , many of the best high-tech firms are taking six months or longer . " <p> In the meantime , many companies , large and small , stumble or stall . <p> " Nobody likes to talk about the companies that are being affected by this executive shortage but they 're out there , " said Diane Bisgeier , a headhunter with Christian &; Hill in Cupertino . <p> For instance she said PointCast Network , one of the early firms to popularize push technology on the Internet , has stalled while looking for a chief executive . <p> " PointCast had tons of momentum six months ago , but you 're not hearing about them now , " Bisgeier said . " They 're still looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business has been on hold since it started looking for a CEO in June . She said PointCast is still building its executive team and making new product announcements . " We 're down to a short list of some really top people , but we have n't got a time frame for an announcement . " <p> Many companies are having to settle for less than their ideal . <p> John Young , former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and member of the board of Novell Inc. , has experienced the executive shortage first hand . <p> Last summer , when former Novell chief executive Bob Frankenberg resigned as head of the troubled software firm , Young was part of a search team that spent about seven months hunting for a successor . <p> After being turned down by first- choice candidates like Oracle President Ray Lane , Novell settled on Eric Schmidt , former chief technology officer for Sun Microsystems . <p> " It is absolutely the case that companies are ( hiring ) people that two years ago they would n't have thought about , " Young said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big firm before Novell , was the best match given " the range of candidates we were able to choose from . " Young added : " He has n't had CEO experience but he 's got the technical vision to make Novell great again . " <p> Schmidt admits that he was a dark horse candidate in part because he had recent profit and loss responsibility  --  something most CEOs have . <p> Knowing how hard it is to recruit top people , many of the largest companies are giving their own senior managers more reason to stay put . <p> Jonathan Holman , a leading Silicon Valley headhunter , said corporations like Intel and HP " have gotten much smarter about handing out stock to the people they want to keep . Nowadays , trying to get an executive vice president to jump ship is like persuading Al Gore to quit on Bill Clinton . " <p> Bisgeier , the Cupertino headhunter said companies are having such tough times attracting CEOs they are looking for executives outside their own industries . <p> For example , she said Dale Fuller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dell , was recently hired as CEO of WhoWhere , the Mountain View search engine company . <p> " They had to take a chance that somebody from a hardware business could run an Internet/media company , " Bisgeier said . <p> Going even further afield , this week Electronic Arts , the San Mateo video game maker , hired John Riccitiello as president and probable successor to its current CEO . Riccitiello had been president of Sara Lee 's bakery division and before that worked for Wilson Sporting Goods . <p> David Theobald , president of NETSHARE Inc. , a Novato newsletter that advertises executive openings , said it 's hard to find a CEO mainly because the top job is getting harder . <p> " Ten years ago all a CEO needed was financial skills and an ability to give orders , " Theobald said . Today , the top executive has to be more of an inspirational leader . " The CEO has to be somebody who has people skills and the ability to motivate the entire organization . " <p> But for people several levels below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier . <p> " Companies are being forced to promote division managers to CEOs , " said headhunter Nosal . " If you have a record that proves you 're an A-player , you could get your shot . " <p> And how 's the pay ? Nosal said a CEO for a private startup with the potential for $ 50 million to $ 100 million in annual sales should get $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 per year in base salary , with 100 percent cash bonus for performance plus anywhere from 2.5 percent to 10 percent of the company 's shares . <p> HOW TO HANDLE A HEADHUNTER <p> If you 'd like to be a CEO , it can help to establish relationships with headhunters . Here are tips for doing so from two headhunters : David Nosal of Korn/Ferry and Diane Bisgeier of Christian &; Hill . <p> * Do n't call a headhunter directly . " I always wonder if a guy has time to call me , what 's he doing ? " Nosal said . <p> * Do ask friends and mentors to call headhunters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nosal said . " The kind of network you can mobilize tells us a lot about you . " <p> * Do take calls from headhunters . Even if you 're not ready to move now , " it starts a relationship , " Bisgeier said . <p> * Get quoted in news articles . " That grabs our attention , " Bisgeier said . <p> * Build your track record . " A division manager who has launched new products or turned around a money loser can look like an A-player , " Nosal said . <p> * Be patient . " Even if you miss on your first or second audition , once we know who you are and what you can do , something is bound to turn up , " Nosal said . <p> * Submit a concise resume that lists your positions in chronological order . " We need to see your career path at a glance , " Bisgeier said .
