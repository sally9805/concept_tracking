What the military can teach us about race , class , and citizenship <p> Like much of southeast Washington , D.C. , 8th Street has seen better days . But at the corner of I Street sits one local landmark unscarred by age , crime , poverty , or neglect-a symbol , you might say , of tradition untouched by progress : the U.S. Marine Corps barracks . <p> Amid urban chaos , it is an oasis of order . A guard mans the gate ; inside , crisply uniformed men and women move with purpose . The lush , manicured parade , maintained by a horticulturist and a staff of 20 , spreads to the foot of the commandant 's residence . From the band room drift sounds of the United States Marine Band- " The President 's Own " - rehearsing a haunting classical refrain . <p> But not only the physical contrast to the surrounding streets is stark : Those who live within this haven 's walls are a breed apart as well . The young enlisted Marines I meet , none older than 24 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry themselves with pride and speak in modulated tones , their words laced heavily with " ma'ams ? ' Their answers are thoughtful . They have come , by and large , from the South , and from the working class , the children of seamstresses and social workers , farmers and factory workers . But from the first day of boot camp they abandon their inherited identities to be reborn into the military class . <p> They signed up for many reasons  --  patriotism , opportunity , challenge , to find their mettle . Corporal Gabriel Ford , 21 , enlisted three years ago after growing up on a West Virginia farm and deciding college was n't for him . His parents divorced early , and he wanted to make something of himself before making a commitment like marriage . The Marines promised to make the most of him . " They break you down to ground zero , " he says , " and then build you up . You realize you can be a leader , that you have all these qualities that you never knew you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Corporal Adrian Santiago , 21 , was born in Mexico and raised in Chicago , where a persuasive Marine recruiter snagged him on the cusp of high school and adulthood . The recruiter convinced him that the Corps offered what he wanted from life : the chance to travel ; to grow up ; to afford more education . Such blandishments may seem to have cultish echoes , but they all happen to be true . Indeed , they are time-honored reasons for military service . Chief Warrant Officer Joe Boyer says he signed up 20 years ago because everyone from his Illinois small town high school was " going to the farm or going to work at Caterpillar to make bulldozers ? ' Neither option appealed to him ; slaying dragons and seeing the world did . <p> Yet Boyer says civilians have told him he must have gone into the military because he was too stupid to do anything else . This white male Midwesterner looks at me and says , " I am a stereotyped minority . " He 's right . Among the well-educated and well-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option of last resort . <p> Twenty-five years ago , that notion had some merit . Once the educated began to evade the draft , and then were let off the hook entirely by the draft 's end , the military became a place for people with few options . Drunkenness , drug use , desertion , illiteracy , and racial tension were rife . Forty percent of Army recruits were high school dropouts . <p> But beginning in the early 1980s , the armed forces began raising standards and requiring , if not a high school diploma , at least a GED ( and only a tiny percentage of recruits have a GED instead of a diploma ) . Today , the caliber of recruits is the highest in history-more than 90 percent of enlisted men are high school graduates-and the services regularly turn away those who do n't meet their standards . And because they have volunteered , recruits are truly committed . <p> If the raw material is impressive , so is the finished product . The military remains one of the few institutions in American life concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline , and believe in public service ; and it has successfully tackled problems  --  most notably race and affirmative action  --  that continue to bedevil society at large . The military certainly is n't flawless , but it does have a lot to teach us . It 's hard to learn at a distance , though , and the distance between the military and civilian populations has arguably never been greater . All They Can Be <p> In 1989 , Tenn Chowfren immigrated here from Jamaica . He had 19 years of life experience , a high school degree , and " no skills ? ' So his parents did what desperate parents have done for generations : They encouraged him to enlist . In no time , he found himself in Army basic training . Soon , he not only had plenty of skills , but also what he calls " mental toughness , " girded by a five-month deployment in Persian Gulf heat . He quickly ascended the ranks , then decided to go to college and become an officer . Today he is an electrical engineering student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Training Corps ( ROTC ) battalion commander . If he stays in the military , he will rise far . If he does not , he now has the skills and leadership experience " corporate America is looking for . " <p> The military has always been an important force in assimilating and equipping immigrants like Chowfren for success . More remarkable , perhaps , is what it has done for a group of native-born citizens : African Americans . No group has benefited more from the upward mobility the military offers , because no institution in America has offered blacks more opportunity . <p> That 's the thesis of All That We Can Be : Black Leadership and Racial Integration the Army Way , a new book by sociologists Charles Moskos and John Sibley Butler . Moskos and Butler trace the military 's , and in particular the Army 's , success not just in recruiting blacks , but in promoting them to positions of authority . Colin Powell is the most notable , but far from the only , symbol of that success . Seven percent of army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 30 percent of enlisted men . The Army has made affirmative action work without quotas , without lowering standards , and without a white backlash . <p> Moskos and Butler identify several principles the army has relied on and civilian society could learn from . The first is to promote on merit  --  but only after enlarging the pool of qualified blacks from which to select . The army takes proactive steps to ensure that pool is big enough : recruiting heavily on historically black campuses , for example , and establishing education programs to bring the skills of potential recruits and officers up to par . Standards stay inflexibly high , which means everyone promoted has earned it-and everyone working under them knows it . <p> Moskos and Butler also stress that the army worries more about creating black opportunity than eliminating white racism . In truth , though , the nature of the military means that anything that gets in the way of mission accomplishment is unacceptable . Racism gets in the way . " From day one of boot camp , " Marine Corporal Ford , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' The military forces integration ; in doing so , it illuminates why that ideal is still worth fighting for . Lance Corporal Tashawna Craig , a 19-year-old African American from Houston who followed her five uncles into the Marines , says growing up in the south made her wary when she saw the races freely mixing at boot camp . " I never thought I could work with whites , " she says . She learned she could . " When I go home to the South I can feel the tension , " she says . " I 've never felt racial tension here ? ' <p> Military race relations are n't perfect , of course . And if the peacetime benefits are high for blacks , so are the wartime costs : Blacks will be deployed in disproportionate numbers to their presence in the population ( although a disproportionate number of blacks deployed are not sent into combat ) . That 's why some black civil fights leaders look askance at military service : Upward mobility should n't require the willingness to strap on a uniform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about society than it does about the military . <p> The armed services also happen to be the only place , Moskos loves to point out , where blacks routinely boss around whites , who quickly learn that it 's just like being bossed around by ... whites . The military is n't just providing lessons for civilian society , in other words : It is also shaping its charges . <p> In many ways . The military builds character  --  in the sense of resilience , courage , and leadership-by giving young people responsibility unimaginable to most civilians . At age 23 , John Brown , a Marine second lieutenant now training at Fort Sill , Oklahoma , will have under his command a group of enlisted men ranging from privates fresh out of recruit training to a staff sergeant with 10 years of service under his belt . " Some of the junior enlisted men will have personal problems , " Brown says , " their wives still in high school , pregnant , with bills to pay . I will have to think things out to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to look out for them , help them take care of problems so the unit can function effectively/ . ' And military service will inspire an empathy  --  are his men cold ? homesick ? scared ?  --  that he will carry into civilian life . <p> Brown will also acquire a deeply bred sense of ethics . The military operates under a code of honor most of us would find unsustainable . Write a bad check in the civilian world , and your bank subtracts $25 from your account . Do the same in the military and your career may be over . The West Point creed reads , " A cadet will not lie , cheat , or steal , nor tolerate those who do , " but even shading the truth or resorting to technicalities is frowned upon . This is n't always lived up to in dealings with civilians  --  think of military spokespeople misleading the press in Saigon or Riyadh , or Col. Oliver North 's star turn before Congress-but in intramilitary interactions , it is an everpresent ideal . <p> More profoundly , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt : When should you put your life on the line for your fellow man ? Is it ethical to put completing a mission before saving a life ? Is it honorable to put saving your own life before completing your mission ? " If you go to war , " one former Army artillery officer says , " you are morally compromised . Your hands have stains you 'll never wash off if you 've killed someone or ordered someone killed . " Anyone who might go to war must contemplate what justifies crossing a line civilian society considers unbreachable . <p> Then there 's the discipline , which to most civilians seems both archaic ( who cares if your pants are creased properly ? ) and arbitrary ( why should you do what someone tells you just because of his or her rank ? ) . In fact , the discipline is anything but arbitrary : In combat , you must react instantly , as a unit , and you must react correctly ; discipline hones those reflexes . As Brig . Gen. Richard Stillwell lectures a class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " West Point is tough ! It is tough in the same way war is tough . " The discipline is bearable because those giving the orders have survived the same trials , and thrived ; and  --  the occasional sadistic sergeant aside  --  they generally have their underlings ' best interests at heart . The trust is earned . And while complete deference to authority is n't something we want to replicate in civilian life , there is a virtue in learning to do things you might not want to , and learning that you can survive that , too . Those with military experience say it endowed them with unshakable confidence in their ability to overcome any stress that civilian life has to offer . <p> Perhaps the greatest gap between the military and the civilian world is the relative weight each gives to rights and to responsibilities . American society is centered increasingly on individual rights which in the American military are always subservient to individual obligations . People in the military learn self-discipline , but they also learn selflessness . That 's what drew Major Ralph Peters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a military family , he rebelled and became a musician . Then , in 1975 , he was volunteer teaching at a refugee camp housed on a military base . He saw soldiers staying up until 2 a.m. to prepare for classes they were teaching the refugees ; it was a sharp contrast to the " lazy , loudmouthed " civilians he knew . At age 23 , he joined the Army . <p> Beyond the many things the military does daily in the service of society is the fact that its members have literally signed their lives over to protect that society . As our tolerance for military casualties diminishes , in the foreseeable future it is unlikely that thousands of men and women will have to give up their lives for us . But they are prepared to . As a result , they have thought deeply about what it is they are protecting : They are patriots , who will tell you emotionally that of the 20 countries they have visited , America , flaws and all , is the best ; or about how they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " People do n't see the direct connection between their ability to walk around , have protests , vote how they want  --  and the military , " says George Flowers , a Marine second lieutenant based at Fort Sill , Oklahoma . People do n't , in fact , see the connection between the presence of a strong military and their right to disparage it . A Corps Apart <p> Given that people in the military seem to have both bigger muscles and stronger moral fiber than many of us , it 's no wonder that increasingly they exude disdain for nonservers and the mores they live by . Thomas Ricks of The Wall Street Journal provided a classic case study when he followed a group of Marines home from boot camp in 1995 : They described their old friends as " losers . " The Marines I met concur . When she first came back from boot camp , Tashawna Craig says , civilians suddenly seemed " so stupid , so silly , " and most of all , " so undisciplined . " <p> The Marines may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard University , Army ROTC cadets with prior service as enlisted men express distaste and sometimes dismay at the behavior of their college peers , who talk in class , goof off , and party too much . Todd Mielke , a 23-year-old freshman who enlisted at 17 , wants his degree so that he can become an officer , but he is palpably uncomfortable with civilian life . Among his pet peeves : the litter . In the army , you damn well pick up after yourself . " We 've got really high personal standards , " Mielke explains . But on campus , he says , people just throw their trash down . <p> The truth is that spending time around a group of Marines makes you very aware of your imperfections  --  from messy hair and tardiness to flabby thighs and white lies  --  which I suspect is one reason a lot of civilians keep a distance . ( One Army officer I interviewed launched into a tirade on the terrible eating habits of civilians : They ca n't handle a knife and fork , they chew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thankful we were on the phone , and not at lunch . ) Such standards of behavior are simply foreign to most civilians . <p> Which is why , more and more , those drawn to the military lifestyle are themselves the products of military families . Consider Lance Corporal Christina L. Wright , one of the young Marines at the Washington , D.C. barracks . Her stepfather was in the Marines ; from the time she was five , he conducted room inspections while she stood at attention . From then on , she says , she knew that she too would be a Marine  --  as is her older brother ; as , she expects , her two younger brothers will be . She does n't like the city , does n't trust most of the civilians around her , and will always be far more comfortable with the Corps . The 18-year-old 's goal is to become the Marine Corps ' first female sergeant major ( the highest ranking noncommissioned officer ) . <p> Indeed , more of those joining the armed forces are also making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is troubling . We have inadvertently developed a professional military caste . " I 'm concerned we 're losing touch with the society we 're supposed to serve , " Joe Boyer says . Thomas Ricks wrote earlier this year that " It now appears not only possible but likely that the US. military over the next 20 years will revert to a kind of garrison status , largely self-contained and increasingly distinct as a separate society and subculture . " <p> Reversing this trend requires understanding how the last 30 years brought us to this point : As society was shifting radically away from military values such as patriotism , and towards individualism and anti-authoritarianism , the proportion of that society serving in the military dwindled to a tiny minority . And most conspicuous in the nonserving majority , of course , were society 's decision makers and opinion shapers . High Class Dodgers <p> In his autobiography A Good Life , Ben Bradlee recalls chomping at the bit to escape Harvard to go fight in World War II . Three decades later , another Harvard student and future journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft , an experience he recounted in a 1975 Monthly story . Bradlee 's enthusiasm was widespread among his classmates ; so was Fallows 's recalcitrance . <p> What happened ? Well , Vietnam , most cataclysmically . Until approximately 1963 , military service was a rite of passage for many young men , including those either born to the upper classes ( Kennedys ) or destined for the upper ranks of the meritocracy ( Elvis Presley ) . It was fairly rare to find a government leader  --  or sports star , or movie sty , or journalist , or businessman  --  who had not experienced military service . It was the moral thing to do , and a generational bond . Two-thirds of Charles Moskos 's Princeton class of 1956 went into the military after graduation . Among the Princeton graduates drafted or enlisting around then : Neil Rudenstine , now Harvard 's president ; The New York Times 's R.W. Apple ; sociologist William Julius Wilson . <p> But as the Vietnam war machine geared up , leaders began opening loopholes , notably educational deferments , that told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve . As the war 's ignoble character became apparent , the well-educated and well-off rationalized evasion as moral , and service as stupid or wrong . Meanwhile , those without the education or know-how for escape , or those who believed k was their duty , went to Vietnam . The result was the politicization of military service , and indeed of patriotism : You were " with " America , or against it , in the military or opposed to it-and most young elites were opposed . <p> By 1973 , when we officially instituted an all-volunteer force , the notion that not serving was the moral thing to do had been cemented . The system now reflected that : Instead of selecting soldiers from the population as a whole , we would purchase a proportion of our youth on the labor market . That , naturally , changed even more who served-and who did n't . No longer would the chil dren-or youthful versions of-Fortune 500 executives , Ivy League professors , senators and congressmen , and journalists have to evade service ; they could simply ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or working-class , or just plain poor . And so only a minority of the generation now assuming power in government , media , academia , and business has served-a circumstance that will become more dramatic as World War II and Korean War veterans retire or expire . <p> One sign that the privileged feel no obligation to serve is in the numbers signing up from Ivy League schools and similar institutions . In the Princeton class of 1995 , for example , 13 graduates went into the military . It 's not entirely surprising : The military does n't bother recruiting at many elite universities , and campus culture militates toward Wall Street , law school and consulting , where the milieu is familiar and the pay bountiful . The few who are interested in public service opt for programs like Teach for America or the Peace Corps . Nor do campuses offer many role models of military service , because few professors are veterans . Moskos , for example , is the only one in his department . <p> Indeed , it is professors who have often led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military : ROTC programs , which once drew significant numbers into the armed services . During and after Vietnam , many prestigious private colleges phased ROTC out in the face of student opposition . In the 1970s and 1980s , ROTC made something of a comeback . But then came the fight over gays in the military , and once again , ROTC programs became political sacrificial lambs . ( Some campuses also barred military recruiters . ) In 1991,62 ROTC programs were closed . That certainly was n't all due to the controversy over gays in the military ( as tuition has risen , the number of scholarships the military can pay for has fallen ) but some of it was . And this time , the opposition was led by professors-the same generation who had been students voicing similar opposition during Vietnam . Where ROTC survived , as at Princeton and Dartmouth , it was largely because students resisted professors ' opposition to the program . <p> Expelling ROTC programs from elite campuses may send a message , but it also has costs . For many students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a " Tier-1 Alpha " ( i.e. , expensive ) school like Princeton can pay up to $20,000 annually . Ivy League campuses also have been a wellspring for-more liberal minded officers over the past few decades . The military is an inherently conservative institution , made more so by the end of conscription , which essentially meant the end of white liberals in the army . By bringing in students from diverse campuses , ROTC helped mitigate that homogeneity . " A lot of people in the military do n't want Harvard grads , " says Air Force Colonel Charles J. Dunlap . " They want people from conservative schools in the Bible belt . They do n't want an insider with a different outlook  --  and that 's very bad for a military in a democracy . ' . ' <p> If elite service benefits the military , military service also benefits the elite , or at least broadens their horizons , by doing what public schools once did : integrate people of different socioeconomic backgrounds . " You learn arrogance in the Ivy League , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a Harvard graduate student . " You learn humility in the army , because some guy from a college you 've never heard of knows a lot more than you do . " He describes working with young enlisted men from backwater high schools in Louisiana and being profoundly impressed by their motivation and intelligence . When he told them so , many said he was the first person who had ever told them they were smart . <p> That few similarly privileged youth share that experience is troubling , because they often grow up to be powerful adult leaders . Georgetown University 's School of Foreign Service trains the elite of the foreign policy establishment , and it would seem logical that students have some interest in the military as a key foreign policy tool . Not so , as Richard G. Miles , a U.S. Army Reserve captain , found when he enrolled at the school . " The sum total of my classmates knowledge about military matters-ranging from tactics to tanks-came from movies and magazine articles , " he wrote in Newsweek . The Princeton-educated former Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in a career in politics or diplomacy . " I thought it would be inappropriate to strive for a position where I would be directing the military without having been directed myself .. ' That is an uncommon perspective among aspiring political leaden these days . <p> Close to 60 percent of men in the Senate are veterans , but only 36 percent of the House ( and a fifth of the freshman class ) . Only 20 percent of Senate-con-firmed Clinton appointees are veterans , and only 4 percent of the White House staff ( a fact that understandably has aroused the ire of vets who wonder why the administration looks like America in every category except military service ) . And consider the roster of possible presidential candidates who avoided active military service : Clinton , Gramm , Quayle , Cheney , Forbes , Kemp , Gingrich . Says one Army officer : " If Clinton tells an 18-year-old to go fight , he expects him to go whether or not he thinks it 's a good idea . Yet he did n't think Vietnam was a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't . I 'm not saying he did n't make a morally responsible choice . But given what he does command the armed forces ... it 's a problematic choice . " The same applies to all those with similar pasts who want his job . And it explains why Dole keeps running on his war record : He knows it resonates with the generation for whom service was a moral obligation . <p> Civilian leaden not serving is n't just morally , but also pragmatically , problematic . For a civilian to command the military he must have the military 's respect . To earn the military 's respect , he must understand military culture . Fewer and fewer civilian leaders do . Thus , the Clinton administration has been marked by a litany of real and perceived slights and faux pas . Officers mutter about how Clinton salutes sloppily , with a shamefaced demeanor . They have not forgotten the White House staffer who allegedly told Gen. Barry McCaffrey , " I do n't talk to people in the military . " They have not forgiven the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ridicule Clinton 's attempt ( under the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act of 1940 ) to use the president 's role as commander-in-chief to delay Paula Jones 's suit . Clinton managed to reopen old wounds when he said he felt " vindicated " in his avoidance of military service by Robert McNamara 's concession that Vietnam was a mistake . And the perception that Clinton is morally challenged does n't help his credibility in the socially conservative armed forces . <p> It is obviously important to have some leaden in government who have n't served , who have a skeptical attitude toward , not a vested interest in , the military . But it is crucial as well to have people in the White House and Congress who understand the institution , who know what questions to ask , as Dwight Eisenhower did , and who have the credibility to get answers . That 's all the more true because at least some of the leaders who avoided service sometimes seem less skeptical about the military than guilt-ridden about their own past . " Thirty years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service now truckle and fawn to demonstrate the depth of their regard for men in uniform , " writes Andrew J. Bacevich , a professor at Johns Hopkins 's School of Advanced International Studies . <p> Thus we have Bill Clinton , who somehow manages simultaneously to piss off and kiss up to the military . Eager to curry the military 's approval , or fearful of incurring its wrath , Clinton has shied away from responsibly downsizing the military-industrial complex . Instead , there 's hairy-chest beating , as the administration boasts about the size of its defense budget ( which , of course , has less to do with military readiness than making smart decisions about how to spend the money ) . And , as The Wall Street Journal recently noted , Clinton just ca n't say no to Veterans Affairs Secretary ( and war hero ) Jesse Brown , whose budget keeps increasing even as his department 's hospital system is vastly underutilized . <p> What matters even more is whether leaders have children or relatives who are serving , or know people who do . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of congressmen or administration officials have served , but by all accounts it 's a tiny percentage . " Ask any group of male community leaders over age fifty how many served in the military " former Navy secretary John Lehman has written , " and eight of ten hands will rise ; ask how many have children who have served and it will rarely be one or more . " <p> Yet many of these leaders are deciding to send the military into risky situations , particularly in the post-Cold War era , when " military operations other than war " have become commonplace . Where our national interest is not at stake , but our " values " -a much broader rubric-are , will we sacrifice American lives ? That 's never easy , but it is slightly easier if you are sending abstract " brave men and women in uniform " rather than Bobby Jones from your hometown . Easier , too , when the bodies come back . Consider that of 220 Marines killed in the 1983 Beirut bombing , 78 were Catholic and 64 were Baptist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were two Episcopalians , two Presbyterians , and no Jews . Of the 19 Americans recently killed in the Saudi Arabian bombing , 10 were Roman Catholics , and five Baptists . <p> The same standard , of course , ought to apply to journalists who are exhorting the president to send troops for a peacekeeping or humanitarian operation . Yet many journalists expressing such opinions also have nothing  --  or no one-at stake . Many of those covering the operations also have no military experience . That does n't make good coverage prohibitive , but it makes it harder . During the Gulf War , for example , reporters stuck to what they knew : They based themselves in five star hotels in Dhahran , and reported  --  literally  --  from poolside ( although they did n't tell their viewers that ) . They allowed themselves to be herded around by a Pentagon whose assertions went unchallenged . It took a week , for example , for the press corps to wake up to the fact that the Pentagon 's boast about an 80 percent success rate in air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the target and delivering the ordnance , " not whether the ordnance actually hit the target . <p> Off-base notions about the military do n't just surface in nonfiction . The intellectuals who shape popular culture and public perceptions no longer do military service either . Herman Wouk , James Jones , Irwin Shaw , Norman Mailer wrote , and imagined , great novels about war and the army from experience . Most of today 's novelists are n't serving  --  and neither are producers , screenwriters , or directors , which is why so many of today 's military characters are caricatures . ( Two recent movies , The Rock and Broken Arrow , both feature mad vets holding cities hostage . ) <p> No wonder so many of us are so ignorant about today 's military  --  and so many elites so dismissive of it . " Working-class folks respect the military because they constitute most of it , " says Ralph Peters , who now works in the Office of Drug Policy . " But when ! meet academics , or people in government or the private sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can also speak in complete sentences . " <p> Peters not only can speak in complete sentences ; he 's actually quite brilliant . He is a Russia specialist  --  fluent in the language , conversant in the literature , authoritative on policy and culture . He has an M.A. and four years of education beyond that . He is writing his seventh novel . Believe it or not , " military intellectual " is not an oxymoron . <p> The irony is that even as we fail to recognize the brains in the military we imbue it with all sorts of other superhuman qualifies , romanticizing what we do n't really understand . The national hysteria over Colin Powell was akin to the second coming of Christ ; somehow , we projected his ability to lick Saddam Hussein onto bad schools , drugs , the economy . Clinton boasted during the first presidential debate that he had " appointed a four-star general as drug czar ... the most heavily decorated soldier in uniform when he retired , " as if the correlation between a successful military career and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This rosy , hazy view of the competent modern military encourages civilians to expand the military 's purview into peacekeeping , drug interdiction , humanitarian intervention , riot control , disaster relief , even chauffeuring Olympic athletes , an inclination compounded by the fact that we now have a 1.5 million person military with no Cold War and no clear mission . A belief in the omnipotent military sends more soldiers into harm 's way ; it also gives a potentially dangerous level of political power to the military . <p> The combination of a powerful and self-righteous military and a naive and guilt-ridden civilian leadership is n't a good one . A military is crucial to a democracy but is not itself democratic , and we do n't want a society in its image . What we want are civilians who understand and respect what the military is and what it does , and who share the burden of public service it increasingly shoulders alone . Universal Service <p> John Keegan 's masterpiece of military history , The Face of Battle , contains a striking scene from the battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce French onslaught when a British officer , Captain Wyndham , spots a French Grenadier clambering over the gate . Wyndham has a weapon in his hand , but rather than shooting the interloper himself , according to an eyewitness report , he " instantly desired Sergeant Graham , whose musket he was holding while the latter was bringing forward another piece of timber , to drop the wood , take his firelock and shoot the intruder . " The blood would be on the sergeant 's hands , which was exactly Keegan 's point : The officer class had begun to find killing in battle distasteful and therefore were delegating the dirty work . <p> Waterloo is now battlefield lore , but this story has its modern permutations . Who gives the order to kill , and who executes it , is n't just a wartime dilemma . Any democratic society that wants to ensure its preservation grapples with the same decision  --  or ought to-on a daily basis , especially when the military is under civilian command . I 'm certainly not in a position to condemn those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush off to a recruiting office after college . But I think if we are going to ask others to do what we ourselves are unwilling to , we should consider the implications of an all-volunteer military . It 's harder to do that when the military is an isolated abstraction . <p> The obvious solution , one this magazine has long advocated , is to resurrect the draft . That remains a noble ideal , but an increasingly impractical one . The military today is much too small to sustain the numbers universal conscription would chum up . Much of its operation also requires a technological sophistication that draftees would have difficulty acquiring in a year or two ; there is less of a place for conscripts in an increasingly professionalized military . A draft , remember , might not just draw in the elite ; it could also pressure the military to accept those it now prides itself on weeding out . <p> So how do we stem the growing alienation between civilians , especially elite civilians , and soldiers , and recover the class mixing , character building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided ? Various educational measures could improve civil-military relations : Require military officers to go to civilian graduate schools and civilian decision makers to spend time at military academies ; preserve or restore ROTC on campuses , both to provide access to the military and because its mere presence can educate students about military affairs ; and have undergraduates study military history and culture . <p> But we need to take more dramatic steps , especially as military service becomes less a calling than a ticket . Recruiters now rely more on appeals to bread-and-butter needs and aspirations than to patriotism and public service . " Are you in the market for skill training , a guaranteed salary and money for college ? " the phone message at one Army recruiting office asks . These are certainly valid reasons for joining the military ; and pay and benefits need to be generous enough to lure good people and recognize the service they perform . But the danger is that gradually the civilian ethos of serving yourself will overwhelm the military ethos of serving the country , that young people anxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less lucrative returns military service provides . <p> Reversing this trend ultimately may have nothing to do with getting more people to serve in the military-and everything to do with getting more people to serve , period . The fact is , a tiny proportion of college graduates go into the Peace Corps or Teach for America . Most go to work for themselves-a fact those in the military , or considering the military , ca n't help but notice . People are simply out of the habit of serving . <p> As a remedy , Moskos and Butler propose national community service for young people . But since we ca n't afford a national service program for all young Americans , the best compromise may be a national service lottery : If your number comes up , you can do military service ( if you meet the military 's standards ) ; or , as in Germany ; you can opt for civilian service . Those going into the military will , of course , be putting more on the line ; their compensation should reflect that . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the armed services , including at least a few more children of the powerful and privileged . A lottery would also provide the military with more short-termers and fewer lifers , which would mean a healthy injection of skepticism and self-criticism by those whose careers would n't be on the line . For those serving , it could renew a national sense of obligation , an understanding that rights require sacrifice . It would impose discipline on its participants and demand responsibility . And it would throw together young Americans of every stripe . <p> National service is , of course , popular among neoliberals , but what surprised me was how many military people I talked to proposed it  --  indeed were passionate about it . This is , in part , because it would make those who volunteer for military service feel less alone in shouldering the burdens of citizenship . But it is also because they believe in duty , honor , and country-and understand that paying tribute to those words has lit-de to do with wearing a uniform . <p> We Want You !
