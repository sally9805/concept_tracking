More Emphasis on Creativity and Imagination Imitation is NOT the Sincerest Form of Flattery ! <p> There is a beautiful farm in Vermont that has everything going for it photographically . Classical barn setting , gorgeous fall colors , leading lines , perfect framing , ideal lighting . Personally , I have never seen Jenne 's Farm . But I have seen it in hundreds of slides and prints . And you too can have a winner if you find the tripod holes made by thousands who have successfully photographed this classic scene from the same ideal spot . <p> I am weary of Jenne 's Farm . I think it 's the sameness . When I judge competitions and see a slide or print of Jenne 's Farm , I am confronted with the judge 's dilemma . I must try my best to judge the scene on its own merits . But it 's very difficult to do . Frankly , if I never see another slide of Jenne 's Farm I .... <p> I feel the same way about the beautiful scenes of the Southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful deep blue sky ( ably assisted by a polarizer filter ) . All absolutely wonderful in color , light , composition , etc . But enough is enough ( maybe too much ) . <p> There is a certain amount of " sameness " in our photography that , after a while , becomes tiresome , even boring . I am always looking ( hungering might be a better word ) to see something new , something different in terms of subject matter , point of view , composition , light , color , technique , inventiveness , creativity , interpretation , feeling , emotion , etc . <p> Hyman Raphael Shevelev wrote a most incisive article in the PSA Journal of December 1987 titled " To Comfort the Disturbed and Disturb the Comfortable . " He wrote that camera clubs ( he referred to these as Camera-clubville ) were surrounded by picturesque though forbidding mountains  --  meaning that it 's a closed society , which keeps the same ideas inside the wall of mountains and also keeps new ideas from entering . " Cameraclubvilles , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though for future archaeological discovery , of Yet More Standard Stuff ( YMSS ) . " <p> Mark E. Fohl , APSA , in a PSA article " An Instructor 's List , " published in the May 1992 Journal , says " I personally tire of seeing the same old photographs , whether or not they are done well technically . I get bored by repetition . I seek out the fresh and new . " Fohl , and others in his salon group , list some of these " tired " subjects : railroad tracks converging in the distance , closeups of bugs , mating insects , sunsets , stairs and railing shadows , oblique angle pictures of buildings , old weathered barns , reflections of trees in puddles , hot air balloons , portraits of old men with beards and pipes , Jenne 's Farm ( and much more that I did not copy ) . <p> The author of this article also wrote a " P-Es-say " along lines similar to the Shevelev and Fohl articles , which was published in the PSA Journal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art of Photography ? " The answer , of course , is that there are no limits . <p> Joe Timmer , APSA , one of the highest PSA award winners ( now deceased ) , was a wonderfully creative and inventive photographer who was widely recognized and applauded for being different . Joe explained this copyism by saying that " When we see the successes of other photographers we are prone to imitate their approach " ( so that we too can win ribbons , medals , and points ) . Daring to Be Different <p> The opposite of sameness/copyism is " different . " Straight photographers who have created photographic art have been different in a variety of ways : point of view , composition , light , color , framing , leading lines , focus ( sharp , soft , selective ) , etc . Such differences create that most significant word : " IMPACT " ! Impact is experienced when something in the photograph grabs and holds the viewer 's attention . This is vital , especially since most viewers ( including competition judges ) invest about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or print . Henri Cartier-Bresson was also emphatic on this time-view limit , saying that " The photo that succeeds is the photo that is looked at for more than one second . " Straight Photography Can Be Different <p> There are many " masters of photography " who photographed straight scenes in a different manner . Edward Weston , renowned as one of the great American photographers , photographed natural landscapes , nudes , forms such as peppers , shells , and rocks , with sensual overtones that raised the images to the level of poetry . Alfred Stieglitz often chose to photograph in rain , mist or snow to create the desired softness of effect as well as to illustrate that vision was more important than equipment . Ansel Adams injected majesty and grandeur in his photographs of the West . <p> Richard Avedon was known primarily for his work in fashion and portraiture . He presented stylistic innovation together with a fresh new look of his models photographed in unusual positions and lighting that projected dramatic intensity . However , to me , his photographic impact was mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the " civilized " facial expressions and body movement were not ready for the camera . What resulted was a face or figure that reflected the true mood , personality , and emotions of the unposed subject . This type of portrait was not loved by his subjects , but Avedon gloried in his capture of truth . Such portraits revealed the intense , creative personality of the photographer in revealing an emotionally charged expression that had a high degree of viewer impact . <p> PSA member David Hughes of Medway , Massachusetts , was also different . He created fantasies and abstractions that were fascinating in color , design , compo-sition  --  all very highly imaginative , I vividly remember the first time I saw Dave 's essays ( without words  --  just slides and music ) . I was overwhelmed . I mentioned this to a man sitting next to me in the auditorium . He said , " I like straight photography . I photograph what is there , not what is not there ! " Differences in Technique Can Be Creative <p> A number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dare to be Different . " * In the script and slides I explained how photographers can , if their feelings are so inclined , shift from straight photography to contemporary/creative photography as one means of being different . Mostly , this required the use of imagination together with certain techniques of the camera and other photographic items of supply . These included the use of mylar film to create highly colorful abstractions ; rear screen projection , which uses existing slides and other accessories to create imaginative scenes ; flowers under water to add bubbles and sparkles to your flower compositions ; selective focus which provides a sharp subject surrounded by a blur of supporting colors ; panning , which projects a feeling of motion to still photography ; the use of patterned glass to achieve a painterly effect ; the creation of derivations , mostly through the use of lithographic film which adds intense blacks to your original color slides ; and the use of diazachrome film to convert light colors to other colors of your choosing ; and the combining of your original slides with litho slides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic impact . Moving from Straight to Imaginative Photography <p> There were movements in art that shifted from straight and limited photography , such as landscapes and portraits , to different concepts , such as impressionism , cubism , etc . <p> This represented a departure from portraying " what is there " to presenting the artist 's impression , feelings , emotions about what they were seeing , and expressing such reactions in their paintings . As in most instances when different viewpoints are expressed , there was considerable criticism and nonacceptance . But , gradually , over time , understanding and appreciation led to increased acceptance . This shift from straight and limited viewpoints also manifested itself in photography , where it became known as " creative " or " contemporary " photography . <p> Shevelev , in the article previously mentioned , also says , " It is not necessary for a photograph to ' tell a story ' or make sense in the conventional way in which we understand these things . It is necessary for good photography to please and disturb and suggest and challenge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Marc Chagall , for example , painted cows leaping over house tops , figures with two faces ( as did Pablo Casals ) , drank fiddlers at weddings , cande-labra and other things floating in the air , and more . Chagall did not explain his work , saying , " They are only pictorial arrangements of issues that obsess me . The theories which I would make up to explain myself and those which others elaborate in connection with my work , are nonsense . My portraits are my reason for my existence , my life and that 's all . " <p> Marcel Duchamp 's painting of his famous " Nude Descending a Staircase " when initially shown at the New York Armory ( which gave Americans their first in-depth view of the radical innovations taking place in European art , purported to render the sensation of an individual descending a stairway  --  Figure 1 ) initially shocked and horrifiedviewers . Some laughed and many viewers asked " What does it mean ? " The " crime " that Duchamp committed was to speak to the imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , Gjon Mill , an electrical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( where he came to know Harold Edgerton , developer of the stroboscope ) made a photographic tour de force of Duchamp 's painting . This high-speed action photograph of a nude woman 's figure descending a staircase , revealed the beautiful intricacy and graceful flow of movement too rapid or too complex for the eye to discern . He made this extraordinary photograph in 1942 . <p> Man Ray was a pioneer artist and photographer . In his portrait of Mina Loy ( Figure 2 ) , he has the subject wearing a most unusual earring  --  actually a long thermometer suspended from her ear . And note the closed eyes ( What ? No catchlight ? ) . I enjoy that photograph with its subtle touch of humor . After Man Ray saw Marcel Duchamp and other cubist works , he decided to vividly do colored cubist compositions and anti-artistic creations . All breaks of convention were legitimate to him and his work upset the tastes of the day . In his work ( painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be different , to be inventive , to be creative , original and spontaneous . <p> When Man Ray 's work was criticized , he said , " When I saw I was under attack from all sides , I knew I was on the right track . I never stopped . " The title of his autobiography indicated , once again , the creative thinking of the man and artist . Instead of using the word " autobiography " he used the artistic term " self-portrait . " Challenging the Viewer 's Imagination <p> So far , in most of these various works of art , the artist projected his imagination and visions to the viewer . In other instances , the artist or photographer requires the viewer to use his own imagination regarding what he is seeing . For example , photographer Ralph Gibson concentrated , in many instances , on parts of things and parts of people , revealing slices of poignancy and which challenge the viewer 's interpretation of what is projected . His entire approach is so unusual that it is difficult to realize that Gibson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Great Depression . <p> For example , Gibson photographed the back of a man 's head . The man 's hair is curled at the back of the neck . Only a thin slice of a white shirt is seen , and only the shoulders of the man 's black suit is seen . It is so different that the viewer pauses to look more than three seconds to understand what Gibson is portraying and why . Another photograph shows only half of a woman 's face . The unseen half is blocked from view by a wall . There are horizontal white lines on either side of the half-face , as if to lead and suspend the viewer 's attention of this unusual portrait . <p> There is another photograph which shows the back of an elderly man , his hands clasped behind his back , holding the stem of a single white flower . What does the old man holding the flower look like ? Why is he holding a flower behind his back ? Who is in front of him ? Who is the flower for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 3 ) . <p> And , finally , one other example of Gibson 's provocative photography . We see a man seated at a table , resting his head on his arms . We do not see the face , only the old , worn hat on his head . The man appears poor , depressed , tired . Beside him there is a piece of crumpled paper , as if to symbolize the crumpled emotional and physical state of the man . We feel a sense of despair and hopelessness . It 's a simple yet powerful picture . We feel that we or society should do something to help this man . We experience feelings of deep regret and sadness . And long after we have seen this photograph , we keep remembering and thinking about it for many years after ( Figure 4 ) . <p> All of his photographs of fragments , of pieces , which provoke our emotions and imagination , are further intensified by the stark black and white with which Gibson photographed . Gibson 's pictures require reflection to comprehend their meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he has , indeed , accomplished his objective . New Art on Paper-2 <p> The concept of this article was triggered by an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art , titled " New Art on Paper-2 " which was most unusual . This exhibition by the museum was in response to a grant for the acquisition by the museum of " adventurous and risk-taking " contemporary works of art . Part 2 was expanded to include photography . The museum stated that the grant has enabled them to assemble bold and experimental works that Philadelphia audiences might otherwise never see . <p> The exhibition included paintings and photographs " by emerging artists whose reputations were on the cutting edge of critical acclaim , rather than works by the most established artists . " The organization which made the grant stated that " We recognize that in art , as in business , risk-taking is essential to continued vitality and progress . " <p> In both art forms ( painting and photography ) , inventiveness and creativity are provocative . Zeke Berman , in a photograph titled " Cans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on black background ) shows bottles , cans , wire , string , and a table against a backdrop of black-draped cloth , together with two other panels . He says that his photograph " is a conceptual conundrum which the viewer must puzzle out using the visual clues . The viewer must reconstruct the image in order to understand what he or she is seeing , and first impressions are constantly challenged in the process ( Figure 5 ) . " <p> Of his photograph , Berman says , " I hope that observers experience a kind of puzzlement , and understanding , that people will reconstruct the picture as they are looking at it and that there is some parallel between the perceptual experience of looking at my pictures , and the cognitive process of constructing the world in general . " Conclusions <p> The many comments about " sameness and copyism " by eminent and highly respected PSAers should be seriously considered if the quality of photography by PSA members , and PSA as a whole , is to be improved . Sameness/copyism can be avoided with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be different through the use of our imagination , through the use of photographic techniques , by expressing our own individual thoughts , views , feelings and emotions of what we see , not only with our eyes , but with our minds . In addition to challenging our own creativity , we can also challenge the reactions of viewers . <p> Let us make Hyman Shevelev , Mark Fohl , memories of Joe Timmer and David Hughes , and the competition judges happy by " Daring to be Different " ! <p> * " Dare to Be Different "  --  a " how-to " slide program ( slides and text ) is available for loan from PSA Recorded Lectures Program ( Number 80 ) .
