<p> CHICAGO  --  Given up for dead in the NBA Finals , the Phoenix Suns played until they were dead tired Sunday night . <p> Pounding out a dent in one 's pride is never easy . <p> For the Suns , it took an exhausting marathon of a game , a triple-overtime thriller that will be remembered as one of the most exhilarating in NBA Finals history . The Suns broke through with a 129-121 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Sunday night at Chicago Stadium . <p> Embarrassed when they departed Phoenix in a 2-0 hole , the Suns cut the Bulls ' lead to 2-1 with a gritty showing and a remarkable transformation . Suddenly , they would n't die . <p> " " I think it will go down as one of the outstanding and exciting games in history along with the other three-overtime game in which I was a participant , " Suns coach Paul Westphal said . " " This time , the good guys won . " <p> The Suns and Boston played three overtimes in the Celtics ' Game 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing on this one . <p> " " For us to have a chance to win ( the series ) , we had to win today , " Phoenix 's Charles Barkley said . " " No matter what anyone says , you ca n't win when you 're down 3-0 . " <p> Nobody has , anyway . The Bulls came home with visions of a four-game sweep , but those plans are history . <p> " " We were tired , " said Michael Jordan , who had 44 points on 19-of-43 shooting . " " You have to give them credit for their stamina and hard work . <p> " " We came in with the idea of sweeping . Now , we have to adjust our thinking . I wanted to get it over with as soon as possible . <p> " " It 's been a long season . " <p> And this was a long , long game  --  3 hours , 20 minutes , to be exact . Extra-inning baseball games have been known to finish faster . <p> This one seemed destined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the game at the end of regulation and the first overtime , the Suns got Dan Majerle 's 3-point shot that put them ahead 119-118 and triggered a 9-0 surge that finally vanquished the Bulls . <p> Majerle led the Suns with 28 points and tied a Finals record by making six 3-point shots . <p> Barkley , playing with a painful injury to his right elbow , was subdued offensively , although he finished with 24 points and 19 rebounds . <p> The Bulls , meanwhile , got Jordan 's 44 and 26 from Scottie Pippen , who shot 12-of-35 from the field . <p> Suns point guard Kevin Johnson finally made it to the NBA Finals , scoring 25 points , handing out nine assists and grabbing seven rebounds . <p> But this was not a game of numbers . This was no ordinary , run-of-the-mill , gut-check victory , either . <p> This was 63 minutes of sheer excitement , pressure and tension . It 's probably a good thing Game 4 is n't until Wednesday . <p> The participants may need that long to catch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first since 103-100 late in regulation , on Majerle 's 3-pointer with 3:03 to go in the third extra period , which put them ahead 119-118 . <p> Pippen made a critical error when the ball slipped out of his hand , and the Suns capitalized as Barkley was racing downcourt . His dunk made it a three-point lead , and after a couple of botched possessions , Barkley stole a pass from Stacey King after King had rebounded a Suns miss . The resulting Barkley slam made it 123-118 with 1:25 to go . <p> All the Suns had to do was hit their free throws the rest of the way , which they did . <p> " " I can remember a lot of intense playoff games , " said the Suns ' Danny Ainge , who had 10 points and five assists off the bench . " " This one was really a lot of fun . I 'll never forget this game . We knew we had to win it , but we went out and were loose . " <p> The third overtime was almost like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nice finishing touch , but it was only the climax to a superbly played game . <p> Getting to overtime was half the fun , maybe more . <p> The Bulls opened the fourth quarter by missing 10 of 11 shots . If they were ever sitting ducks , it seemed this was the occasion . <p> Phoenix ran up a 99-88 lead as Ainge capped a 7-0 run with a 3-pointer . <p> After an exchange of baskets , the Bulls got serious and got back in the game . <p> Clamping down on the Suns defensively , the Bulls reeled off 10 consecutive points , including two that came the embarrassing way , if you were a Sun . Especially if you were Ainge . <p> The Bulls were inbounding the ball under the basket , and Pippen hit Ainge , who had his back to the baseline , in the rear with the ball . Pippen quickly hopped inbounds , grabbed the ball and slammed in an easy two points . <p> When Horace Grant tipped in a Jordan miss , the Bulls had closed within 101-100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-point play with 1:33 to go , tying the game at 103 . <p> Neither team could score the rest of the way , although the Suns certainly missed a classic opportunity . <p> Johnson stole the ball from Jordan with 15 seconds to go , and Majerle was streaking downcourt for what would have been a breakaway slam . <p> Johnson , a little flustered , looked at coach Paul Westphal , started to signal for a timeout , then heaved a pass to Majerle . <p> However , the refs ruled Johnson had called time out . <p> " " I did n't call it ; he ( KJ ) called it , " Westphal said . " " I was saying , " Go , go . ' But he called it . He saw me and threw the pass ( to Majerle ) , but he had already called it . " <p> When play resumed , Barkley 's 18-footer rattled in and out with a second to play , and the Bulls ' lob pass to Grant did not produce a basket . <p> The tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mark West clanging two free throws . <p> Pippen put the Bulls ahead with a 16-foot jumper with 3:30 left , but the two sides would exchange fruitless possessions for nearly two minutes before Barkley pump-faked Scott Williams into the air and was sent to the free-throw line . His two shots tied the game with 1:43 to play . <p> The Bulls were running everything through Jordan at that point . And he responded . First , he was fouled on a drive to the basket , but the refs ruled he was not in the act of shooting . After Pippen missed a jumper from the corner , Jordan got the ball and knocked in a jumper from just beyond the free-throw line with 1:05 to play , putting the Bulls up by a basket . <p> The Suns had missed all four of their shots in the overtime before Tom Chambers sliced through the Bulls ' defense for a tying layup with 50 seconds to go . <p> Jordan missed a jumper as KJ and Majerle were running at him , and the Suns had another chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got a driving prayer by Johnson , a Barkley rebound and fall-away jumper from the baseline and a wide-open 3-pointer at the buzzer by Ainge . <p> When all three missed , the exhausted teams gathered themselves for the second bonus frame . <p> As the Suns started the second overtime with four missed shots and a turnover , they had to consider the possibility they were in a serious scoring drought . Since being up 101-90 , they had scored six points in more than 14 minutes . <p> The Bulls , meanwhile , went up 111-107 with two minutes left in the five-minute frame . The gap still was four with 40.2 seconds to go after Jordan hit one of two free throws for a 114-110 Chicago lead . <p> Barkley scored from the baseline with 32.6 seconds left . <p> Pippen then uncorked a beautiful , wide-open , 18-foot jump shot from the wing . <p> Unfortunately , he was 20 feet from the basket . That set up Majerle , stationed at the 3-point line . He pump-faked , then stepped in for an 18-footer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman numerals for the extra periods by then .
