Operation Just Cause was less than eight hours old , but General Colin Powell was all but declaring victory . As Defense Secretary Dick Cheney looked on approvingly , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff boasted that a 24,000- man U.S. force had " decapitated " Manuel Antonio Noriega 's army and seized control of strategic facilities along the Panama Canal . Though the crafty dictator was still on the loose , Powell said that it was only a matter of time before U.S. soldiers tracked him down . The only bad news in Powell 's rosy report was the uncertain fate of a dozen American hostages , seized by fleeing Panamanian irregulars as they cut and ran from approaching American troops . <P> On the battleground in Panama , however , a far less optimistic drama was unfolding . Confounding Pentagon hopes that Noriega 's Panama Defense Forces would quickly crumble under a devastating U.S. onslaught , the fugitive dictator 's men were preparing a determined counterattack . Instead of the quick and decisive knockout U.S. commanders had sought , the invasion was in danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama City . House-to-house fighting in a crowded urban area was something military planners were leery of because of the threat to civilians . <P> In recent months the Pentagon had quietly bolstered American forces in Panama in preparation for a possible strike , adding 4,500 combat troops , as well as tanks and attack helicopters , to the 8,500 soldiers already deployed at U.S. bases . The force was so strong that Pentagon planners had briefly considered dispatching a column of U.S. troops to nab Noriega during an ill- ! fated uprising by P.D.F . officers last October . That daring plan was quickly  --  and , as it turned out , wisely  --  discarded as too risky and uncertain . <P> Just how risky became clear as Operation Just Cause got under way . Many of Noriega 's 4,000 best troops , including units that had raced to his rescue during the failed coup , were posted far outside Panama City . Another , less predictable menace was posed by the brutal Dignity Battalions : 8,000 fanatical pro-Noriega irregulars who had savagely attacked opposition leaders in the aftermath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces , many P.D.F . soldiers slipped away , only to reappear later and launch counterattacks in Panama City . <P> When George Bush ordered military action against the increasingly arrogant dictator , the Pentagon put the finishing touches on the option it preferred and had been secretly preparing to implement : a massive simultaneous assault on all P.D.F . strongholds by a combination of forces already in Panama and a huge airlift of reinforcements from bases in the U.S.
