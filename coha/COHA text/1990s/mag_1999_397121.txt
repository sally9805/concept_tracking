Section : Culture Zone Mixed Media Art and technology make slightly uneasy partners <p> Forget the streets . in Tempe , Ariz. , this winter , they were dancing in the fast lane of the information highway . At the International Dance and Technology Conference ( IDAT ) , hosted by Arizona State University and its Institute for Studies in the Arts , virtual dancers , real dancers and animated life-forms toe-tapped on sensory stages and keyboard-tapped in galleries . They even sent choreography into cyberspace by Webcasting 27 hours of the conference activities , including panel discussions , performances and demonstrations . <p> Whether they were dancers using technology or technologists experimenting with art , IDAT performers displayed how far digital technology could serve them in extending bodies , motion and audience perception . Throughout the conference , dancers outfitted in audio uniforms , optical suits and holographic costumes controlled video , sound , projected images and lighting with a flick of a finger or a flex of a knee . After a weekend immersed in demonstrations of how technology can augment displays of artistic human motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displays of techno-assisted artistry , the connection between dance and technology is not always made . <p> Of the score of demonstrations at IDAT , Songs for the Body Electric by composer Todd Winkler and dancer Gerry Girouard stood out . The athletic Girouard wittily danced on the walls and ceilings of specially constructed boxes with the aid of a simple rubber-tipped pole . Girouard 's space-cutting kinetics-handstands and carving arm motions  --  tripped signals to vary the music and lighting . His digital collaborator in this process is Very Nervous System , created by David Rokeby ( see " Dances with Machines , " p. 58 ) . <p> The disconnect in many of these productions stems in part from a mismatch between the artists and the technologists . Consider , for example , choreographer Ellen Bromberg 's Falling to Earth , a piece that was created on the Intelligent Stage-a sensory space that registers and responds to input through video , audio and cueing systems . Artist/technologist Doug Rosenberg projected lyrical imagery and descriptive text on S-curved drapes and the dancers ' bodies . <p> The adolescent narrative ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Age-y music , however , reminded us that no matter how well the technology is executed , without equal artistic elements , beauty is only screen deep . Not that making technology and artistry equal partners is without its own dangers . In Inner Spaces of Drifting , video artist Rogolja Wolf and choreographer Jennifer Predock-Linnel offered mesmerizing aquatic images on the screen and a smart dance trio , which seemed lost in the dark at the bottom of the horizontally divided set . Screen and stage worked here as partners of equal but separate strength , forcing the audience to choose between watching one or the other : a two-ring circus . <p> Others at the conference more successfully integrated technology with art . In her hallucinatory dance , Communion , Montreal dancer/choreographer Isabelle Choiniere explored ancient and contemporary nuances of dance within a tableau-like form . As electronic whispers invoked the goddesses Isis , Diana and Hecate , Choiniere  --  clad in a sensor-laden , DayGlo leotard  --  reproduced her image on the scrims in front of and behind her . With majestic movements , she evoked this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scrims , she drew a molten voice from her red-lit mouth . In slow dissolves , Choiniere seemed to incarnate the temple dancer , body builder , exotic dancer . <p> In Troika Ranch 's powerhouse In Plane , the only livestock was a two-legged creature : Dawn Stoppiello , in electronically augmented garb . The outfit is called a MidiDancer sensory suit by its inventor , Mark Coniglio . Coniglio-Troika Ranch 's composer and co-artistic director  --  positioned sensors within the garment that encoded information and sent it to an offstage computer . Stoppiello thus controlled the dynamics and timing of Coniglio 's music and video projections . She raced like a speed skater against her own image . <p> Since 1993 , Troika Ranch has been an incubator for posing what was perhaps the main question of the conference : Which comes first , the dancer or the technology ? Based on the IDAT showcase , techno-artists are still struggling to solve this riddle . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : High-tech tutu : A ballerina from Berlin 's Die Audio Gruppe turns movement into sound with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
