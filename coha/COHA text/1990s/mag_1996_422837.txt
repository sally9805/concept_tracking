DOUBLE DIPPING WITH A DRAWL The swamps , dense undergrowth , and farmland of southern South Carolina support an enormous whitetail herd , as well as quail and wild pigs . It is tree-stand country , and if you 're able to sit motionless for 3 hours at a clip , you can do some good , as they say down there . For out-of-staters , the best way to hunt is at a lodge or club , as they are called down there . Prices vary greatly , depending on accomodations , and if you do n't insist on luxury , you can get some very good hunting for a modest price . Not only that , but the countryside is laced and dotted with blackwater streams and ponds where the local bass await your pleasure . It 's a low-pressure , slow-paced type of fishing that 's good through October and into November . You find it by stopping at crossroads gas stations and general stores and asking . Permission to fish , if needed at all , usually is n't hard to come by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little money , you can eat enough to hurt yourself seriously .

LONGBEARDS AND BASS For spring bass and turkey lovers , Truman Lake near Warsaw , Missouri , is double-dip country supreme . Turkeys gobble on the hardwood ridges while you cast a spinnerbait to one of a trillion flooded dogwood , sycamore , and cedar trees . On a late-April morning , you can literally take a boat out before sunrise , locate a hot bird pronto , and if the hunt is successful , be back in the boat and opening the tackle box to catch the breakfast bass somewhere along 958 miles of shoreline . And at this time of year , Truman 's muddy Osage , Pomme de Terre , Grand , and Tebo arms yield plenty of crappies as well as bass and places to cajole a gobbler . Throw in an increasing walleye population , plus stripers and big catfish , and you have a potential sextuple-dip . Recent heavy spring rains have hindered hunting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break , Truman can be hard to top . Contact : Bucksaw Point Resort at ( 800 ) 331-4072 . CHUKARS AND TROUT Idaho 's Salmon River is no place for tenderfoots . Everything 's tough here , including the game . Chukar partridge favor the steep , rocky hillsides , where they can flush and glide into the bowels of one of the world 's deepest canyons . The steelhead , which amount to turbo-charged rainbows , are masters at stripping line off your reel and finding any weakness in your drag or knots . This sporty combo has made a paradox of the term " River of No Return . " Sportsmen keep coming back to this river to scuff boot leather in the morning , relax with a rod and reel in the afternoon , and dine on surf and turf along a river sandbar . I 've had the best results multi-day drift-boat floats between Whitebird , Idaho , and the confluence with the Snake River , although rafts and jet boats each have their virtues .

There are too many . After I hunt ( ducks or geese ? ) , should I fish for tarpon , tuna , marlin , snapper , mackerel , redfish , speckled trout , or largemouth bass ? Venice is where the road ends and the vast Mississippi River delta begins . Every fall , approximately 1 million waterfowl arrive to spend the colder months in a wetland wilderness accessible only by boat . Two huge wildlife refuges  --  the state-run Pass-a-Loutre area and the Delta National Wildlife Refuge  --  provide hunting that can give newcomers a glimpse of what the oldtimers once knew . When the hunting is finished , the fun is only halfway through . The rich estuary of the delta is the engine that drives the most prolific fishery in the continental U.S. Local hunters do n't ponder whether to take a fishing rod along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing guides , contact the Venice Marina at ( 504 ) 534-9357 ; or Cypress Cove at ( 504 ) 534-9289 . BIGHORN CAST AND BLAST While the Bighorn River tailwater in southeastern Montana is best known for its world-class trout fishing , the same region offers hunting opportunities ranging from big whitetail deer in the riverbottoms downstream of Hardin to sharptail grouse and pheasants on the surrounding prairie . And Montana game biologist Charlie Eustis even reports huntable populations of Merriam 's wild turkeys along the lower river . Bighorn trout fishing is open all year , but September , October , and November are favorite months , when big , near-spawning browns will whack marabou muddlers in the mornings and sip hatches of minute blue-winged olive mayflies in the afternoon . Hunting side trips are best accomplished with a guide . To obtain a complete listing of guides , call the Montana Board of Outfitters at ( 406 ) 444-3738 .
