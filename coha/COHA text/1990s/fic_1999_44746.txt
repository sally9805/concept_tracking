IT WAS THE COLDEST MORNING so far this winter . The clouds had blurred into a whitish gauze , through which the sunlight glittered like patches of frost . At first , he 'd thought the car would never start . Then he 'd lost an hour queuing behind lorries and buses on the Warwick Road , where the open  --  plan traffic system seemed to induce a kind of collective paranoia . It was n't until he got past Solihull , and the landscape opened out into soft fields and perspiring woodland , that Mark began to think about the conference ahead . Two days of market-speak , management-speak , the voice of the corporate sphincter . Two days of spreadsheets , SWOT analyses , performance indicators , e-mail numbers , acetates and acronyms . Two days of Brian 's cigars and Gareth 's nervous jokes . Two nights with Cathy . <p> The hotel was near a village called Wormleighton , out in the extensively franchised wilds of rural Warwickshire . It was called the Pines . According to Gareth , who 'd stayed there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Swiss/Austrian feel . " Sort of a Black Forest chateau . " In his conference folder , Mark had a leaflet about the hotel . It showed a murky , faux-Gothic building , surrounded by fir trees . There was a small lake to one side , probably artificial . The leaflet concluded with the message : You 'll be pining to return . Cathy had said it reminded her of a Leadbelly song about jealousy , about a murdered husband . Mark had n't known what to say to that . <p> Cathy was the human resources manager at the Bromsgrove site . Mark was a production manager at the Knowle site of the same company . They 'd met at a sales conference the previous year , and again at the Christmas party . Which was where the affair had started , really , though they had n't slept together until a hastily arranged night just before the New Year . It was n't just the need for discretion that made him cautious . Mark did n't want to get in so deep he could n't get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakier than his ; but even so , she was n't the kind to take risks . It had to be kept on ice , like a bottle of vodka you were saving for a special occasion . Still , he 'd been looking forward to this weekend in an increasingly obsessional manner over the last couple of weeks . Whatever the room arrangements were , they 'd find a way to be together . She 'd promised that , in an almost tearful mid-evening call from her office to his . A call that had ended with them listening to each other 's breath , as if they were falling asleep in the same bed . <p> The sketch map in the conference folder showed a narrow road going through Wormleighton , then uphill to the small forest around the hotel . Mark saw a gray stone tower , then a partly ruined manor house . He glanced at the fields , seeing horses , cattle and , unexpectedly , a chestnut  --  coated stag . Jackdaws circled in pairs above the trees . The roadway was smeared with frost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A flash of sunlight melted the windscreen , dazzling him . The image of Cathy floated behind his vision . Her short auburn hair , cut in a high fringe at the back . Her upturned nose . Her beautiful smile , the teeth just a little too strong . Her dark , painful eyes . Mark shook his head , banishing the image . The road was lined with trees now : firs , cedars , pines . Almost the only green things left in January . Winter felt like an absence , not a season at all . <p> Suddenly , the view to one side fell away . A small lake was set in the hillside . Almost circular , frozen . It must be far colder here than in the city . The ice was gray with blotches of white . Two kids were skating on it . Mark slowed down to watch them . A boy and a girl , about fifteen , similarly dressed in ski jackets and black jeans . Their linked hands were ungloved . It was like the slow dance at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it was hard to look away . The car stopped , braked , stalled . The couple moved together , spiraling outward in a shared arc . They kissed . Mark was suddenly aware of the frozen mass that held them up . The coldness that freed them to move and touch . He turned the key in the ignition and drove on . <p> Half a mile further , the road widened into a car park . The hotel was there : dark , angular , unexpectedly small . Most of its windows were shuttered . There were traces of snow on the surrounding trees , though he 'd not seen any driving up here . As he got out of the car , the sunlight flared like burning plastic . Cold air scratched at his face . As he pulled his suitcase out of the boot , he realized he was crying . Quickly , he wiped his eyes , hoping no one had seen him . Red eyes would n't look good at the conference ; they 'd think he 'd been drinking . Around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burnished company cars . Without greeting any of them , Mark straightened his tie and walked into the hotel . <p> The interior was lit entirely by candles , high up in multi-armed candlesticks around the lobby and the staircase . Red velvet awnings and black furniture gave it a vaguely Gothic feel , like the set of a Roger Corman film . However , the lettering on the message board was wholly conventional . He gathered that the first seminar was in the Holst Room , followed by lunch in the Beethoven Suite . Mark 's room was con the second floor . He decided to use the staircase , which looked like marble : a pearly white veined with crimson . The steps were a bit too large , and slightly damp ; when he grasped the handrail , its surface was greasy with polish . The effort of climbing made him worry about his fitness . Too much driving , not enough exercise . On the first-floor landing , he glanced upward : a tight coil around darkness , like a fossil of some primitive organism . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You had to use the door key to connect it-unlocking the light , so to speak , before pressing the switch . The wavering candlelight from the corridor hardly diluted the shadows in the room . He fumbled inside the door , smelling dust and wax polish . Then the light sprang on : two yellow lamps in wall brackets , neither more than forty watts . If he needed to work in here , he 'd complain . There was a low but comfortable-looking bed , with a red velvet bedspread and two black pillows . He lay back on it , suddenly aroused by the-thought of Cathy . Would she be at the seminar ? Forcing himself to think about work , he sat up and blinked at the wall . There was a picture of a forest , black distorted trees against a murky sunset . Or was it a fire ? <p> Unpacking only what he needed for the seminar , Mark hurried back down the precarious steps to the ground floor . The Holst Room was probably as close to a normal conference room as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed shells around a space at the back , where an OHP had been set up next to an old-fashioned lectern . The first few rows were full already . Mark nodded and smiled at a few colleagues ; then he sat at the back , looking out for Cathy . No sign . During the next two hours , while the three Sales Directors droned on about marketing strategies and the audience laughed politely in what seemed the right places , Mark 's imagination kept returning to the black-sheeted bed . He took notes dutifully , sketching cats and spiders in the wide margins . At least this room had electric lights , not candles . The final question-and-answer session dragged , sales colleagues asking for information they already had just to show off how well-researched the department was . <p> The Beethoven Suite was at the end of a long corridor whose walls were paneled in mahogany . The light from stainless steel candelabras glittered on crystal glasses and etiolated cutlery . Subdued music , probably that of the nominated composer , drifted from speakers in the ceiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room . Just inside the door , a grand piano stood in dust-free silence . Mark could n't help wondering if it might be an injection-molded replica . As he joined the queue , a hand brushed his arm . " Hi there ! " It was Cathy . <p> For a moment , he almost reached out to hold her . The candles flickered , sending out a ripple of darkness . Then he recovered . " Cathy ! How long have you been here ? " It was getting harder to cover up in front of colleagues . <p> " About an hour , " she said . " Some motorway trouble . An accident just in front of me . They took down my name and address , as a witness . One driver had to go to hospital . Then I got here ... and got stuck in the lift . My room 's on the fifth floor . " Mark felt an involuntary twinge of disappointment . " Must have pressed the wrong button coming back down . The lift door opened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No light , outside the lift . I could hear something . Like ... wax . Dripping . It was a corridor . " She looked away . " I kept pressing buttons , but nothing happened . It was cold down there . I thought ... then something connected and the lift shot back up to this floor . By the time I 'd recovered and finished complaining to Reception , the seminar was due to finish . " <p> Cathy was shivering . Mark squeezed her arm gently . " I 'm okay , " she said . Her smile made him feel breathless . Be careful , he thought . This is dangerous . For a moment , absurdly , he could n't remember his wife 's name . <p> The afternoon was slightly less dull than the morning . One of Cathy 's colleagues from the bright lights of Bromsgrove led an imaginative ( if slightly insincere ) discussion on risk-taking in business management . Later , Mark gave a report on production control methods in the Glass Suite , a sparsely furnished room decorated with repetitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience was too busy taking notes to appreciate any of the sarcastic asides - in particular , a reference to Volume 13 , Issue 42 of Which Mobile Phone ? fell absolutely flat . Worse , an older colleague came up to him afterward to ask whether the magazine was available from W.H. Smith 's . <p> Then there was a break , during which he and Cathy slipped out for a quiet walk . It was unexpectedly cold ; neither of them had an overcoat . Darkness was gathering in the trees , filtering down from the burnt sky . No one was skating on the lake ; deep cracks ran across the ice , though not deep enough to expose the water . Near the edge , some black unfrozen pockets showed through . After checking that they were alone , Mark put his arms around Cathy and kissed her deeply . They rocked together , listening to the silence . Cathy 's jacket rode up as she embraced him , the shoulder-pads trembling like vestigial wings . Without speaking , they returned to the hotel . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company was developing its use of IT resources . There were four speakers , including Cathy . She talked about ways the company could use the Internet for research and communication . " Of course , it 's no more private than a noticeboard . But like our noticeboard , it 's so crowded with stuff that no one knows what to look for or where . So information is only confidential if it 's information that no one wants . For secrets , use the phone . For real secrets ... " Cathy bent down and whispered something into Brian 's ear . Mark felt an irrational surge of jealousy . It was a joke , he thought . Lighten up . Cathy glanced at him and smiled ; he did n't manage to smile back . <p> Feeling angry with himself , and uneasy at the way things seemed to be changing , Mark went up to his room to unpack before dinner . This time he took the lift , and almost went flying when he stepped out into a corridor whose floor was about six inches below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlocked the door and the light , and wondered whether the smell of wax came from the furniture polish or the candles in the hallway . There was a small chest of drawers by the bed ; the top drawer at first refused to budge , then shot clean out from its runners , banging Mark 's knuckles and almost hitting his legs . Reciting a list of obscure sexual practices , he replaced the drawer and put some underwear in it . Then he hung up his jacket in a wardrobe tall enough for suicide . <p> Familiar with hotel showers , Mark adjusted the temperature control before turning on the water . The resulting blast made him think of steam trains . Biting his lip , he turned down the temperature until it changed abruptly to lukewarm . There was no reduction in the force of the spray . The floor of the shower cubicle was smooth , not unlike the stairs , and became dangerous when coated with soapy water . When he stepped out of the cubicle , rubbing at his eyes , Mark discovered that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried his feet while sitting on the bed . It was tempting just to lie down and think about Cathy . But that could wait . He would n't have to dream later . And he 'd better get his feelings under control before rejoining the others . <p> Almost as an afterthought , he phoned Linda at home . The connection was faulty ; as she talked about their son , Mark heard snow falling through the line into his head . " Those computer games we had to get him for Christmas - he has n't touched them all week . Whenever he gets excited about something new , he thinks it 's going to be important for the rest of his life . He 's got to have it immediately ... and then , a few weeks later , it 's completely forgotten . He outgrows things , but he does n't seem to outgrow ... the mentality . " Or the need , Mark thought with an irrational sense of bitterness . He said something noncommittal about Dominic having time to change . He was only nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " These advertisers , they 're destroying time . They 're franchising childhood . It 's not a process anymore , it 's a market resource . " As usual , Mark found himself both agreeing with her viewpoint and concerned about her state of mind . There was no sense in being an outsider . Linda 's anger helped to give him a sense of purpose ; but he still had to fit in , had to get along with the system . Did that make him a hypocrite ? One more thing to feel guilty about . <p> There was a draught in the stairwell ; Mark shivered as he negotiated the whitish steps . Gareth was standing in the foyer , wearing a horrible mauve tie . " Mark ! Come and join the party . You need to join something . " Mark followed him into the Brahms Suite , which turned out to be the bar . What a surprise . He downed a quick vodka and orange , trying to identify Cathy among the gleaming men and power-dressed women . Someone leaned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " God ! What 's that doing there ? " Tall candles flickered in brass rosettes . " There 's something dangerous about this place ... " You do n't know the half of it , Mark thought . He shut his eyes and saw drifting squares of light crossing a blue surface : the Windows screen saver . <p> " Are you okay ? " It was Brian , wearing a crimson silk shirt and looking concerned . Mark nodded and swallowed the last of his drink . The vodka felt colder inside him than the ice-cubes . He made for the Gents sign at the comer of the bar . It was dim and quiet in there ; the piped music , presumably Brahms or perhaps Liszt , was more clearly audible . He splashed water over his face and blinked repeatedly . The window-images would n't go away . Like flaws in a sheet of ice . He wondered exactly what Gareth had meant about joining something . It could have been a coded reference to the staff Christmas party , when Mark had spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rituals going on within his department . Or it could have had something to do with Mark 's lack of political alignment , his occasional jibes at the major parties . The politics of his colleagues repelled him : both the knee-jerk Conservatism of the directors and the shallow attitudes of those managers who 'd switched their allegiance from the ghost of Thatcher to the hologram of Blair . As if all that mattered was identifying and following the highest achiever . <p> His reverie was broken by the coughing of an elderly military-looking man in a yellow jacket . " They ought to change the mirrors in this place , " the stranger muttered . " Whenever I look at one , I do n't like what I see . " Mark smiled in what he hoped was a supportive fashion . It had n't occurred to him that there might be permanent residents in this hotel . He went back to the bar , where Cathy was waiting in a turquoise blouse and skirt that made the candlelight back off in astonishment . " Is your room comfortable ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious , almost frightened . <p> They ate in a different function room from lunch . Mark did n't see the name , but assumed it to be the Wagner Suite from the decor , which included plaster mountain-peaks molded onto the walls and a glittering silvery waterfall running into a trench at one end of the room . The ceiling was painted with a fluorescent Aurora Borealis . Large red candles melted over the wall surface , turning mountains to volcanoes and burning small mahogany villages . They drank some heavy Australian red wine and ate a mixture of game that included rabbit and venison . The music periodically drowned out conversation . Which , given that the conversation on both sides of Mark seemed to revolve around current trends in the business-related software market , was no great loss . Cathy was sitting nearly opposite him , too far away for their legs to touch . Their eyes brushed across each other every few minutes , caressing without holding . She rarely wore makeup , but tonight her lips were very slightly reddened . Or maybe it was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gathering divided itself between several rooms . Most of the older staff settled in the Brahms Suite for a quiet drinking session . Mark decided to remain as sober as possible . Once he got past a certain point with wine or spirits , he lost the ability to stop . At one level , he wanted to drink until the conflicting voices of lust and fear dissolved into a bright silence . At another level , he knew that would be a criminal waste . He joined Cathy in the Saint-Saens Room , where a fairly retrogressive disco was in progress . The sight of young executives reliving their teens , strutting and weaving to the sound-of Donna Summer and Blondie , made him feel uneasy . You could play the same records all your life , but it was frightening how soon you forgot the moves . The room was oppressively dark and warm , with red velvet curtains and a black tiled floor . <p> After a quick trip back to the bar , Mark and Cathy went on to the Zann Room , where the younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder and distinctly atonal , a blend of techno and trip-hop that shuddered with confusion . Nobody was dancing very much . The walls were blue-gray , pricked with thousands of tiny lights like strange drifting constellations . Mark recognized Gary and Sue from the IT department ; they were kissing slowly , their faces blurred by the moving lights . Sue waved at him and said something , but he could n't hear her voice . He felt Cathy 's hand on his arm , turned to see her mouth framing silent words . He reached up and touched her hair . They stood like that for a moment . Then Cathy smiled , tugged at his sleeve and led him out into the corridor . <p> They would have gone up the stairs together , but someone was lurking in the stairwell , watching the entrance . It was Brian . " Hi , " he said a little drunkenly . " Feel a bit woozy . Too much red wine . Thought I might get an early night . " He leaned on the banister , still gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mark remembered . Maybe he 'd broken his own rules . Cathy and Mark wandered awkwardly back into the Saint  --  Saens Room , which was becoming crowded . On little tables around the floor , glasses jittered to the pedestrian beat of " Life in the Fast Lane . " The smells of perfume , burnt wax and spilt wine stiffened the air . When it happened , it seemed like the room had been waiting for it . One of the heavier executives slipped on the tiled floor , staggered and fell . A woman grabbed at his arm , but missed and fell over him , her feet trapped under his jacket . Her pale wrist snapped with a sound like breaking ice . There was a brief silence . Then her shocked face released a thin cry , as it she wanted to scream but could n't . Her right hand flopped like a glove until she gripped and straightened it . <p> The man on the floor sat up , breathless but apparently un ; injured . One by one , the other dancers stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her and helped her to her feet . Before the record had finished playing , two uniformed hotel employees came through a side door and led the injured woman away in a slow procession . Obviously someone would take her to the hospital  --  which might be as far away as Leamington . Mark did n't know who she was . <p> " They should have stopped the music , " Cathy said . They were climbing the stairs together , Brian having disappeared . It was nearly midnight . " No one was moving , the DJ must have known there 'd been an accident even if he did n't see it . Why did n't he turn the record off ? " Mark did n't answer . Every step of the staircase felt like a hurdle between himself and Cathy . The lift would have been quicker and more discreet ; but after Cathy 's experience this morning , it did n't seem worth the risk . On the second floor , they paused . " Your room okay ? " Mark nodded . He was glad of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic . Under the soft fleshy glow of the wine , he felt like he 'd been stuffed with darkness . The link between himself and his life outside was nothing more than a telephone line . He 'd lost the code . <p> They were alone . Mark unlocked his door and reached for the light  --  switch before remembering to use his key . Cathy stood while he fastened the door and hung up his jacket . In the dim light , he could only see broad patches of color : the red bedspread , blue-green wallpaper , yellow lamps . The only sound in the room was their breathing . He put his arms around Cathy 's waist and drew her against him . Her tongue was thin and soft , dancing in his mouth . He stroked her hair , running his fingers down to the back of her neck . You 're beautiful , he whispered to her . Cathy 's eyes clouded . Do n't say anything , she whispered back . Not now . She was unbuttoning his shirt , her fingernails pricking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just under the white skin . <p> Half-naked , they pulled back the bedspread and climbed onto the taut black sheet , then folded themselves around each other . In the poor light Cathy 's eyes were opaque , somehow lifeless . But her teeth glistened , and he could see the faint blush on her throat and collarbone . He reached between her legs and touched what seemed like a skinless muscle . The air was chilly , but they were both sweating . The surface of the bed was firm . Cathy gripped his penis and guided him into her , closing tight around him . Her fingernails drew tracks across his shoulderblades . After a few minutes , she pulled back and twisted over so that he could enter her from behind . Mark pressed the palms of his hands against her nipples and kissed the thin curve of her right ear . Somehow they were facing into the room by now , the pillows forgotten . A flicker of light on the wall made him look up . It was the forest painting . The sunset was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blue-green wallpaper seemed to ripple and flow like a tidal sea . The twin lamps stuttered their dirty brightness . Below him , Cathy shuddered as her cry broke into gasps . The wall was coming . The room was coming . He thrust deep and then held still , feeling the darkness inside him melt and escape . <p> It was only then that he realized he was n't wearing a condom . Those risks were n't part of the plan . What was wrong with him ? They disengaged and lay still for a while , in an uneasy silence . Mark wondered if the blind violence of their lovemaking was somehow a distorted expression of their growing depth of feeling . If so , it was a sign that things were getting out of control . As their bodies cooled , a chill seemed to rise through the mattress and make them embrace . Half covered by the velvet bedspread , they caressed and murmured tenderly until they were ready to make love again . This time , it was gentler and more human ; they cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterward , Mark lay awake in the darkness , wondering why the first time had been so much better . Maybe love needed some coldness to protect it . Fire and ice . You 're pissed , he thought with some bitterness . Cathy had set the alarm for eight . <p> During the night , the fire alarm went off . Naked and shivering , Mark walked down a flight of concrete steps and along a whitewashed corridor . The fire escape presumably led out the back of the hotel , but he could n't see where it ended . He was alone , but there were voices all around him . Everyone must have gathered down here . Cathy had gone ahead of him . After a while , he came to an open doorway through which pale lights flickered . There was an intense smell of melting wax . The voices were crying out , but not in pain . He stepped through the doorway and was suddenly trapped in folds of dark cloth . <p> The digital alarm clock ticked softly , as quiet as a dripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painfully aroused ; but he 'd have to wait until morning . Cathy was stretched beside him , her breathing only just audible . Suddenly his mind lit up with images of the basement . Ringed by the remains of candles , the dozens of writhing bodies . Scraps of underwear crumpled on hands and faces . Reddened skin , glistening with circles of wax and semen . A little furtively , he gripped his cock ; but the images faded at once , leaving him confused and hollow . The dream reminded him of something he 'd always imagined at company meetings : that wherever you got to in the hierarchy , there was some kind of inner circle you could n't reach . The real party was one you were not invited to . The air in the bedroom was cool and smelt only of furniture polish , as if cleaners had come in the night and erased the residues of lovemaking . Mark tried to replay their desperate coupling of a few hours before ; but it seemed facile , staged , like glossy soft-porn . He closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into sleep . <p> It did n't work . A couple of hours later , his curiosity got the better of him . Moving as quietly as possible , he switched on the bedside lamp and put his clothes on , apart from his shoes and jacket . He closed the door carefully behind him and padded along the half-lit corridor to where he 'd dreamt the fire escape to be . It was there ; he must have seen it earlier . The door opened on a spring and closed silently when he released it . There was a long flight of concrete steps , going down into the heart of the building . The chill numbed his feet and made walking difficult . Some faint light , presumably moonlight , filtered through from above . The air was damp and still , like some rotten fabric he had to tear through to reach his destination . <p> At the foot of the stairs was an unlit corridor . He could feel paint on one of the side walls . The texture was soft and crumbly . There were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though there was hardly any sensation in his feet . Near the opening at the end of the corridor , he paused . There was no sound . He walked through , conscious of a growing sexual excitement . Another staircase , completely invisible . He thought the steps were metal and not entirely solid . Another corridor , less than three feet wide . He could hear the very faint sound of dripping , as regular as a clock . The corridor ended in a brick wall . Unless he 'd missed it , there was no side exit . The fire escape was a dead end . He pressed his hands to the moist stone , bewildered by its refusal to yield . Suddenly all he wanted was to be asleep in bed . <p> It took him a while to get back , climbing stairs that felt uneven as well as steep . The sound of dripping faded above the basement level , and the silence frightened him . Eventually he stumbled through the doorway onto the second floor . It was daylight . His feet and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned toward the corridor , a swing door opened . It was Brian and a teenage boy he 'd not seen before . Feeling vaguely reassured , Mark crept back to his room and let himself in . The heavy curtains kept in the night . He undressed quietly and got into bed beside Cathy , who was still asleep . As his head touched the pillow , the alarm clock went off . <p> Breakfast was edgy and subdued . From the number of blank faces and dropped-shadow eyes at the table in the Stravinsky Suite , Mark suspected he 'd not been the only one to have trouble sleeping . The unnatural dawn chorus of stringed instruments jarred his nerves . Too lively for winter . He learned that Tara from marketing , who 'd broken her arm the night before , had stayed in hospital overnight and was going home today . That had n't been the only accident : Gavin the Accounts Manager was limping after a fall in the shower . The left side of his face was bruised gray , like a school playground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on time management . It overran by half an hour . Then two seminars ran concurrently : Gareth on what the company could learn from Japanese corporate strategies , and Cathy on managing human resources . For professional reasons , Mark had to attend the former . It dragged , like a haiku extended into fifty-five cantos . Cathy 's sleeping face drifted across his field of vision , as perfect and expressionless as a mask . It scared him , to feel so deeply about something that would never be complete . It was trapped deep inside him : not guilt and not joy , but something in between . Her fluid movements tracked fire across the inside of his skull ; the way she fucked was no more and no less beautiful than the way she drank coffee or sent a fax . <p> Just before lunch , they slipped away together and went back to the frozen lake . Mark thought he could see a pattern of circular skate-tracks , like the groove in a record . White vinyl . Yesterday 's cracks were no longer visible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare twigs in the wind and the random cries of seagulls that were circling above the lake . Cathy was worried about her seminar . " You talk about managing human resources , it 's like you 've crossed a line between relating to people and using them . It 's a science . I know the theory , every decision I make could be predicted by a computer . They do n't want me , just a machine with my voice . Otherwise they 'd have to admit that these human resources are actually people . " <p> Mark wanted to say something , to reassure her ; but he was thinking about his own managerial routines , the way he used staff appraisals and one-on-one scheduling meetings to control the members of his department . The same rationale : this is n't me , it 's the company . This is how things are done . No wonder he felt cheated . They kissed slowly , their fear sheathed by the cold . The ice shimmered like quartz below them . <p> The whole afternoon was taken up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance . The air was thick with virtual dollar signs . Despite the company 's record-breaking profits , every other word was about cost-cutting . Mark had been working to a shoestring budget for so long , it took events like this to remind him how much money the company actually had . The Managing Director , a man only ever referred to by his initials , laid heavy emphasis on the significance of budgetary control . " The key to successful expansion is effective downsizing . We need to be in control of the culture and the working groups in our various departments . Our culture , not someone else 's . We 're all working hard to phase out union recognition throughout all branches of the company . I do n't need to tell you how important that is , with the prospect of a new British government letting in socialist legislation from Europe . The unions will be desperately keen to help ministers interfere in the way we run our business . Your jobs depend on keeping a tight ship . " <p> Afterward , Mark stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold white spiral and its missing heart . A rush of vertigo made him shiver . He felt like he 'd been at a political rally . But it was only business . For a moment , he wanted to be free of everything . He 'd wait until tomorrow before phoning Linda . His head was full of corporate rhetoric and pornographic images . It was n't stuff he wanted to share . <p> That evening was quieter than the previous one had been . Perhaps the weighty presence of the MD and some of the directors , who 'd turned up for the afternoon , was creating an atmosphere of restraint . People like that would n't risk denting the premiums on their health insurance policies . Whatever the reason , there was no disco . A long-drawn-out meal involving smoked sausage , veal pastries and chocolate cake was followed by an hour or so of obligatory and forgettable networking , then a quiet drinking session in a number of smoke-blurred rooms . Mark and Brian-who 'd got over his embarrassment about the dawn incident when he 'd realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explored the ground floor , a labyrinth of tacky function rooms connected by dark-red corridors . Some of them were showing clear signs of neglect . The Elgar Suite , right at the back of the hotel , was an enclave of British Empire memorabilia where the hotel 's older residents gathered to get quietly paralytic ; visitors were not welcome . The Rachmaninov Suite was locked ; dust furred the inside of the glass-paned door . From the dark interior , the restless sound of piano chords was just audible . The Cage Room was another bar , silent and empty apart from an effigy tipping an empty glass above its mouth . <p> Toward midnight , as the remaining drinkers were painting their inner landscapes with stars , Mark left Brian half-asleep in the Tchaikovsky Suite and went up to his room . There was a small plastic kettle and some sachets of instant coffee ; he made a cup and drank it black , trying to sober up before Cathy arrived . He 'd not seen her since dinner , when they 'd made this assignation . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest picture unconvincing . Maybe none of it worked when you were alone . That was why he 'd been unable to find the cellar . He was still thinking about that when he heard a light , rapid series of knocks at his door . He let her in , flicking the catch on the door as it snapped shut . <p> They sat together on the bed , holding each other as if any movement would risk separation . His hands moved slowly over her back and shoulders . Mark felt hollow with need . He suspected that if tonight did n't work out , they might finish . But talking about the future would only depress them both , strangling desire and isolating them in their separate rooms of guilt . It seemed like the only way forward was to fuck each other into an oblivion where anything could be said . To burn down the forest . You 're beautiful , he whispered again . Cathy smiled . Her eyes widened , then closed as their mouths clasped together . He caressed her through her dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothed one . <p> When they were naked on the velvet bedspread , she used her arms and legs to lift him clear above her , then slowly let him fall until his penis touched the smooth skin of her belly . He came within seconds of entering her , but carried on until she gasped and dug her nails into his sides . Once again , he realized , they had n't taken precautions . The images of his dream returned ; he lifted above her and let her stroke him until his semen was tracked across her pale skin . Then he pressed his face between her legs and probed with his tongue , pushing her knees up over his tense shoulders . They went on like this for some considerable time , until they were dry and narcotized with ecstasy and the sheets were a crumpled mess . Then they pulled the duvet over themselves and slept back to back , not touching . <p> It was still dark when the fire alarm woke him . He sat up and listened to its echoes dying in his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock ticking on one side of him , Cathy breathing softly on the other . The truth was lodged in his head , as clear as ice . How it all fitted together : the company , Cathy , the hotel . None of it worked when you were alone . With Cathy , he could get into the basement . What happened there would enable him to keep her . He listened to her breathing . It was too shallow and uneven for sleep . " Cathy . " <p> " Yes ? Mark ? " There must be a trace of moonlight in the room , since he could just make out the blurred shape of her head rising from the pillow . " What is it ? " <p> " The fire escape , " he said . " You must come with me . Please ? You know what I 'm asking . The party . The real party . You know . " <p> There was a pause . Then she said : " All right . " She reached out and touched his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlocked , they walked naked along the corridor to the whitewashed door opposite the lift shaft . The stone steps were clammy and roughened by flakes of paint . Cathy put her arm around Mark 's waist as they walked on into the total darkness of the corridor , and down the flight of braided metal steps . At the bottom , Mark paused . The floor was slippery with dried wax . There was a dim light at the end of the passage , flickering . As they walked on , he could hear the sounds from the room beyond . He slipped a hand across Cathy 's breasts . The nipples were hard ; she turned to kiss him . They walked together through the stone-framed doorway . There was no door . <p> It was a long , shallow room , roughly oval in shape , like one of the conference rooms upstairs . The center of the room was full of candles . More candles , in various tones of off-white and pink , hung on crude wire chandeliers from the low ceiling . Their wax had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complete than others . Hundreds of tiny flames winked and smoldered in the gloom ; but there was no heat . The room was so cold that Cathy 's breath clouded in front of her face . She stepped away from Mark , toward the edge of the many-limbed composite statue . Part of it reached up and gripped her ankle . She knelt and let the pale , waxy hand move slowly up her thigh . <p> Mark glanced around helplessly . More wax figures were clustered around the edge of the room , embedded in the wall or each other . He could still hear the sounds of rhythmical kissing and slapping , the grunts and moans of bodies locked in passion . But the only movement he could see was far too slow ; and the only faces were blank glistening screens , their eyes and mouths stopped with wax . Cathy was half-sitting now , her back curved , hands and feet dug into a mound of rippling flesh . A thick white candle was pressing between her thighs . Her eyes opened momentarily and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger . " Then she twisted away and shuddered through the build-up of a violent climax . Mark watched , unable to react , as her legs kicked in the air and her right ankle broke like the stem of a glass . <p> He tried to reach her , but she was near the focus of the party and there were too many bodies in the way . Soon it ceased to matter , as hands and mouths fastened upon him and he was no longer alone . At last he realized , not only that the candles were people , but that the people were candles . The closer he got to them , the more human they were and the brighter they shone . However cold it might be , the party would go on . And it was freezing : he could see icicles in the dark ceiling , feel the crystals of ice on the tender faces . A weight of flesh on his arm tore the muscle , but he felt no pain . A drifting membrane brought him to climax and he ejaculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Someone cried out , and the rest imitated . Mark heard his own voice among them . The image of order and repetition grew in his mind . Like a spreadsheet . A spread sheet . Living in the ice , while the dance continued overhead . <p> Author Affiliation
