WONDERING WHY MY IN-LAWS always seem to visit during the full moon , I serve the pate . Am I cursed or merely lucky ? <p> " Oh , thank you , Tatty dear , " says Edna , my husband 's mother . She loads a cracker and inserts it tidily into her bright mouth . " Oh , my . Are you sure this is vegetarian ? It tastes like meat . " <p> Tatty dear ? Is she addressing me , Tatiana , the fierce , the wayward ? What impertinence is this ? I try to raise my eyebrows , but a tiny twitch is all I manage . Inexplicably , I ca n't find the right muscles . A warm smile startles me , flicking naturally across my face almost as if I have nothing to do with it . I know in times past I 've had to force such expressions , but at this moment I ca n't seem to recall when , or even exactly why . A slight nervous tremor begins in my fingertips . <p> " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vegan Solidarity Cookbook . Not a hint of animal protein , I promise you , " I answer . This is not at all what I intended to say . <p> Moreover , my voice emerges from my throat sweet and clear , as wholesome as homemade butter , flawless as Shasta daisies embroidered on cotton pillow cases , smooth as polished furniture . <p> Someone in my heart , not Tatty , is growling gleefully , " Of course it tastes like meat . It 's loaded with rare liver and other delicious entrails . " <p> That 's right , is n't it ! How could I have forgotten ? I glance through the open doorway at the kitchen counter , surprisingly orderly and clean , arrayed with spotless , sharp knives . I see a bottle of virgin olive oil backlit with late afternoon sun , a hundred walnut shells , broken in pieces - no sign of bloody juice or greasy scraps . I wonder if I am frowning . I feel as if I should be . <p> " Scrumptious , Miss Tatty , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not exactly a dyed-in-the-wool vegetarian . I keep hoping Mom will fall back into her former evil ways ... " and here he winks at Edna , " ... but this is damn good . No meat ? I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again . Roger 's a lucky man . I think we 'll keep you . Great apron , incidentally , darlin ' . " <p> I look down at myself . I am wearing a dahlia-print apron with ruffles . How astonishing ! I have to dive deep into neglected memories to dredge up the fact that Edna bought this abomination for me at a church bazaar two years ago . I thought I had safely hidden it in the darkest comer of our largest closet . I would rather die than be seen in it , yet here I am , using it to harvest approval from Edna and Jack . Do they have any idea who their son really married ? <p> " Oh , " I say , " glad you like it . " Tatty , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tatty replies , I am leading a normal life , if you do n't mind . A normal , happy life ! <p> Happy ? <p> As conspicuous as the apron are my arms , bereft of the bracelets that ought to adorn them , gold and silver , jingling like bells , studded with colorful stones . Who has taken my jewelry away ? What is happening here ? I am beginning to feel rather odd . <p> Our children run into the room . Todd is eleven , and his sister Danielle is eight . They have been outside playing , and are breathless and rosy with exertion . Dark mud smears Todd 's T-shirt . Danielle smells sweetly of little girl sweat . What brilliant , lively beings . How I adore them ! I want to swoop down on them with kisses and hugs , but my arms are full of crackers and walnut pat6 and will not do my bidding . <p> " I 'm starved . What 's for dinner , Mom ? " says Todd . <p> I feel the longings of his hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what he needs . Huge hunks of half-cooked beef . Thick giblet gravy on potatoes whipped with heavy cream . Black beer with raw eggs in it . God save us from vegetables . <p> " Almond lasagna with zucchini in garlic and olive oil , " I say in words like little rays of sunshine . " I think you 'll like it . " I think he 'll hate it , but what can I do ? His grandmother believes that animal protein is killing her . Who is more important here , an old woman or our children ? Of course there are things we can do . We can suggest that Edna go to hell , for example . Tatiana , do n't fuck with my life . Tatiana , I 'm warning you . Whose life , I am asking ? Consider this matter carefully . <p> I have to shake my head to clear it . Outside , the sun is setting and I feel a frightening , familiar drop in the temperature of my blood . Get away , Tatty . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them run around this way ? Filthy and sweaty ? Children , we 'll be having dinner soon . You 're in no condition to sit down at the table with us , " says Edna , a glass of white wine halfway to her lips . <p> How dare she ? They are my jubilation ! The loves of my existence . Does n't she understand the profound joy of sweat ? After she and Jack made their own son , and she lay dreaming of his tiny fingers and toes already forming in her womb , did she smell like lilies of the valley , or like a woman , satisfied and moist ? <p> My mouth moves . " Grammy 's right . Go and clean up . Showers would n't hurt . " Good mother . Good wife . Poor good Tatty , I murmur inside myself . And in response , like the sudden flash of claws , oh no , I do not want your pity , Tatiana . I am not poor . We are happy , and you will ruin us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hate us . For God 's sake , hide ! <p> You 've got it wrong , Tatty . You are ruining us . All you know how to do is martyr yourself , sacrifice your desires , and the price is always too high . <p> The children back away , watching me , wide-eyed . They wonder what has become of their mother . Their insight is keen . They sense the disorder of this moment . <p> I carry the pate into the kitchen . Edna and Jack follow me , perching on oak bar stools at the granite-topped island . Everything is unbearably beautiful . The cabinets gleam . The faucets sparkle . Outside , crickets sing in the purple twilight , and a wild green scent issues from the trees . My thighs ache pleasantly . I wish Roger were home . But what would I do if he were ? Pull him into the bushes for five minutes of pleasure while his parents look on ? Would he think I am crazy ? Am I ? The questions are moot . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ivory light , appears above the eastern hills . During the next few moments , it will swell into a powerful , bulging ellipse . The hair along my spine stands erect , tickling , as if insects dance on my skin . <p> I slice zucchini and garlic into a pan of hot oil . A delicious fragrance rises up from it . No , I 'm mistaken . I do n't care for zucchini . I do n't care for it at all . Faint perspiration cools my upper lip . My deodorant seems to have stopped working , and something strange is happening to my scalp . Do n't do this , I 'm begging you . Look around at what we 've got . You 'll destroy it all . I 'm no longer sure who 's talking . <p> I try with all my might to retreat from the stove , to grimace , but I ca n't . Concerted howls strangle and lie stillborn in my throat as the moon rises . Everything inside me rearranges itself ; I can hear the creaks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The force of the heavens is irresistible . The baby powder fragrance of deodorant returns in a powerful tide . <p> " When will Roger be getting home ? Should n't he be here by now ? " says Edna . <p> " Do n't fret yourself , honey , " says Jack . <p> " That 's right , Mom . He 'll be walking in the door any minute now . It 'll be perfect timing . You wait and see . I have an instinct for these things . " <p> Indeed I do . <p> Turning the zucchini with a spatula , I hum a few bars of " Shine On Harvest Moon . " Ivory light drifts through the kitchen window . Victory is mine . The transformation is complete . I chatter innocently and without concern , Tatty dear , the perfect wife , perfectly in control , at least on this night of the month . <p> Author Affiliation
