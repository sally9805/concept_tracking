EXT . MAIN STREET , SMALL TOWN - DAY A freight truck of late 1950 's vintage pulls to the side of the road in a small rural town . A handsome , well-built man gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver . THE NEWCOMER carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up suitcase ; he 's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour , his shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps . He wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around . Until noted below , this section of the movie is in BLACK &amp; WHITE . &nbsp; FOLLETT ( VO ) I get outta the truck in this two-bit town . I got no money and no prospects . What I need right now is a stiff drink , a cold shower , and a hot broad . I 'll take ' em in any order they come . . . EXT .

Oh yeah , one other thing I need --  an angle . He squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing , then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood . &nbsp; FOLLETT ( VO ) I was thinking --  if it were n't for bad luck , I would n't have any luck at all . . . &nbsp; LANDLADY ( OS ) Can I help you ? The Newcomer turns toward the door . Standing there , holding the screen open , is the LANDLADY . She 's a knockout in a cheap , small-town way : a cotton dress that buttons down the front and clings with sweat to her generous curves . &nbsp; FOLLETT ( VO ) Either my luck had just changed , or Fate just bought me another round of trouble .

We have n't had a man around here for so long . . . &nbsp; FOLLETT ( VO ) She kept yammerin ' the whole time , but her hips were doing all the talking . . . The Landlady reaches the tiny landing at the top of the stairs and opens a door to a squalid room with a bed , bureau and tiny window . The Newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous body to get inside and look around . It does n't take long . His gaze returns to the Landlady who is leaning against the door , chest thrust forward . He focusses on her fingers , toying with the button at her sweat-shiny cleavage . &nbsp; FOLLETT ( VO ) It could n't ' a been any clearer what the set-up was . The next move was up to me . . .

Sorry . . . ( indicates his watch ) . . . next time . We see Mumford 's office : the office of a Psychologist , a therapist with a doctorate . It 's modest , comfortable , neat , with a calm , relaxed ambience . The movie is now in COLOR . His patient , HENRY FOLLETT , looks nothing like The Newcomer in the soft-core fantasy he 's been narrating . Instead , he 's a mild-looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding hairline . Only the voice is the same ; it 's as studly as his fantasy alter-ego . Follett has been lying on a couch , but now has twisted with some irritation to look at Mumford . &nbsp; FOLLETTI have eighteen more minutes ! &nbsp; MUMFORDI do n't want to hear any more today .  --  4  --  &nbsp; FOLLETTWhy not ? &nbsp; MUMFORDMr .

Mumford can be seen out the big front window , crossing from the two-story building that houses his office on the main drag of this small town which , oddly enough , is also called Mumford . He comes inside and goes to the counter to pick up some take-out . The Proprietor is a woman around forty named LILY , who talks to him as she works . &nbsp; LILYYou 're early . . . it 's not ready . What happened ? &nbsp; MUMFORDMy patient had to leave early . &nbsp; LILYWho was that ? She comes over to the register with an order . Mumford is am her , likes her a lot . &nbsp; MUMFORDDoes the phrase " nosy " have any meaning to you , Lily ? &nbsp; LILYI think it 's like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5  --  &nbsp; LILY ( reacts ) Man , you see him a lot . And it 's very wrong to reveal it . Next you 'll be saying what his problem is . &nbsp; MUMFORDWhat do you want to know ? &nbsp; LILYYou 're terrible . I 'm never telling you anything . A Patron passes on the way out . &nbsp; PATRONHey , Doc . . . how 's it going ? &nbsp; MUMFORDFine , Vincent . . . how 's yourself ? &nbsp; LILYHow long you been in this town ? &nbsp; MUMFORDOh , I do n't know . . . &nbsp; LILYFour months , two and a half weeks -- - that 's how long . ( Mumford gives her a look ) And you 've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined . &nbsp; MUMFORDLily , I do n't think even you could know that --  Lily sees something out the window . &nbsp; LILYLook at that guy . . . Mumford turns to look out the window . A young man of about 30 , in jeans and a Hawaiian shirt , is skateboarding down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst the cars . He zips past the front of the restaurant . &nbsp; LILYYou know who that is , do n't you ? ( Mumford does not ) You really do n't ? That 's Skip Skipperton , man . He gets himself hit by a truck , this whole town shuts down .  --  6  --  &nbsp; MUMFORDOh , so that 's him ? The Panda Man . LILY hands over Mumford 's bagged order , rings it up . Back on track : &nbsp; LILYSo , what makes you so popular ? What 's your secret ? &nbsp; MUMFORD ( takes his bag to go ) You like me . How come ? &nbsp; LILYNot sure . Let me think about it . Mumford is smiling as he goes out . Another Patron , LIONEL DILLARD , a lawyer , brings his check to Lily , watching Mumford cross the street . Lily ca n't stand this guy . &nbsp; LIONELThat 's the new psychiatrist ? &nbsp; LILYPsychologist . He 's not medical . &nbsp; LIONELProbably thinks he 's pretty smart . Lily gives him a look as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S OFFICE - DAY An overweight , teenage girl named NESSA WATKINS is on Mumford 's couch . She fidgets as she talks and ca n't decide whether to lie down ( so she 's looking away from him ) or sit up and face him . She plays with an unlit cigarette and keeps taking out a lighter , then stuffing it back in her big , sloppy handbag . &nbsp; NESSA. . . so he already had the tattoo that said , " Naomi Forever " . . . and now they 're broken up , see , and he has to have it removed . But while the scar is still healing , or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed , he meets Chandra . And it 's serious , immediate love . So in no time , he 's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America . &nbsp; MUMFORDWhat do you mean , " in no time " ?  --  7  --  &nbsp; NESSAIn maybe three or four issues . &nbsp; MUMFORDWeekly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think Brad is ? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff ? &nbsp; MUMFORDWhy do you think you tell me , Nessa ? &nbsp; NESSADo n't do that thing . . . ( Mumford : what ? ) . . . that shrink thing . &nbsp; MUMFORDIt 's a big part of the show . She jams the cigarette in her mouth and flames the lighter , but is afraid to actually break his rules . &nbsp; NESSAYou really need to let people smoke in here , you know . It 's perverse . What are they paying you to see me ? Mumford indicates " nothing " . &nbsp; NESSAThe school board does n't pay you ? What kind of deal is that ? &nbsp; MUMFORDIt 's called pro bono . &nbsp; NESSAPro boner ? ( he waits her out ) Pro bono , huh ? For whose good , supposedly ? &nbsp; MUMFORDIt 's my bit for the community . &nbsp; NESSAFuck the community . ( he wo n't go for it ) There was this article my friends and I read . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was very fascinating .  --  8  --  &nbsp; MUMFORDWhere was this ? &nbsp; NESSAWhere ? . . . The New York Times . The first one was --  " he handles produce well . " Which we already knew ! ( an expression she uses ) The point is , you have a lot of the signs . &nbsp; MUMFORDYou been spying on me in the supermarket , Nessa ? &nbsp; NESSAHave women found you attractive ? Mumford laughs . &nbsp; NESSAI knew you would n't answer . I 've been thinking about what you said last time . How me trying to lose weight --  and constantly not --  is like a lot of people with addictions . How maybe I ca n't lose the weight , ever . . . ( quietly ) Which we already knew . . . &nbsp; MUMFORDThat 's not quite what I said --  &nbsp; NESSAIt 's a really weird thing for a shrink to say . . . and then you said maybe people 'd be happier if they 'd accept that some things do n't change --  that it 'd be some kind of a relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess I 'm just a dumb bitch , but how depressing is that moment --  the moment when you give up ? Section Details EXT . HIKING TRAIL , MOUNTAIN FOREST - MAGIC The last rays of sun are fighting their way through the trees as Mumford comes up the trail he clearly knows very well .  --  9  --  EXT . BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC Mumford climbs out on the Big Rock , settles himself on the edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle . WHAT HE SEES : far below at the foot of these hills , lights just twinkling on , is the town of Mumford . He stares at it for several long moments . Then he takes a small headlamp from his pack and fits the straps over his head ( it looks like a miner 's light ) . He twists the light on to test it and turns his head to watch the beam move about . WE CUT BACK WIDE . After a beat , Mumford settles back and turns off the light . INT . SCATTERGOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regulars . Mumford has a favorite spot at the far end of the bar . Right now he 's sitting alone , reading the remnants of a newspaper . SKIP SKIPPERTON , the man on the skateboard , comes in . Everyone in the bar is surprised to see Skip in here . Several patrons greet him as he makes his way deeper inside , looking around . He 's uncomfortable . He seems relieved when he spots Mumford and heads back there . Mumford does n't notice Skip waiting for his attention . &nbsp; SKIPHi . Mumford looks up , smiles . Skip offers his hand . &nbsp; SKIPYou 're Doc Mumford . ( Mumford nods ) Skip Skipperton . &nbsp; MUMFORDHow are you ? &nbsp; SKIPFine . Okay . Pretty good . I 've been hoping we 'd meet . I 've heard a lot about you . Mumford waits , friendly . Skip runs out of gas , gets uneasy , glances around . &nbsp; SKIPDo you think we could . . . ? Can I buy you a drink ? CUT TO  --  10  --  LATER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at it a while , but nothing is clear to Mumford , yet . Skip keeps his voice down ; he does n't want anyone else in the bar to hear him . &nbsp; SKIP . . . " Find the need and fill it " my dad used to say --  I guess a lot of dads say that --  but I did and it just took off . &nbsp; MUMFORDNo kidding . . . Panda . Where 'd that come from ? &nbsp; SKIPPanda ? I 've always liked giant pandas . . . I 've been to China and seen them in the wild . That 's the kind of thing I can do if I want . . . now . I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days . Skip stares into his beer for a moment , as though the thought depresses him . He catches himself and snaps back --  &nbsp; SKIPSo now we make 23% of the modems in the market , which is pretty good . Skip glances around , leans in , confidential . &nbsp; SKIPWhen I was growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber business was played out . . . Panda changed all that . Now , just about everybody in town either works for the company or depends on it somehow . Which is kinda the problem . . . Mumford waits , watches . Skip gets uncomfortable . &nbsp; SKIPWould you like another beer ? &nbsp; MUMFORDNah . . . scotch . &nbsp; SKIP ( brightens , like a kid ) Far out . Single malt ? ( gets up ) Can I pick it ?  --  11  --  Skip heads off to the bar . Mumford looks around . Everybody is watching . DISSOLVE TO : LATER . The bar crowd has thinned . Both Mumford and Skip have had a few . In fact , Mumford is now carefully pouring them each another drink from a bottle of Glensomething on the table . &nbsp; MUMFORDYou want me . . . to be . . . your friend . Skip beams . Mumford leans forward in the same confidential way Skip did before ; he indicates that Skip should lean in too . Mumford is almost whispering --  &nbsp; MUMFORDBut that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Skip is excited ) . . . What 's really going on is . . . you have some problems and you want some therapy , but you feel it could be very bad for Panda Modem stock if word got out that you were having head problems . Skip confirms that 's it . &nbsp; MUMFORDCan I ask you a personal question ? &nbsp; SKIPOf course ! That 's exactly what I want . &nbsp; MUMFORDHave you thought about getting a wife ? Skip makes a face and gesture to indicate a large " YES ! " , but also total frustration and failure . &nbsp; SKIPWhen Panda started to happen , I was dating women from New York , San Francisco , L.A. They came out of the woodwork . Models , actresses , venture capitalists . . . These were not the kind of girls who were interested in me before I hit it . . . And you know what I discovered ? I discovered these girls did not love me for myself . The majority of them did n't even like me . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while . Can you imagine that --  marrying someone just because they 've got money ?  --  12  --  Mumford considers that . &nbsp; SKIPI got ta pee . ( he gets up , a little wobbly ) Can I ask you something ? This town is called Mumford . . . Been that way since . . . . . . 18 . . . 18-0 . . . 18-0 . . . ( finally remembers ) . . . thirteen ! Right ? ( Mumford : if you say so ) Now here 's the question --  Your name is Mumford , too . &nbsp; MUMFORDIs that the question ? &nbsp; SKIPYou moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town . Is that right ? ( Mumford shrugs ) Far out . Skip takes a few steps toward the men 's room , then comes back and leans down toward Mumford . &nbsp; SKIPI hope you do n't think I want you to do this for free . Just because we 're gon na play it like we 're friends , does n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MUMFORDI understand . &nbsp; SKIPI have a lot of money . Do you know how much money I 've got ? &nbsp; MUMFORDDo n't tell me , ' cause I 'm not going to tell you what I 've got . &nbsp; SKIPI 've got three big ones . &nbsp; MUMFORDI 'm impressed . I could n't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes . &nbsp; SKIPNo , no . . . I have three billion dollars .  --  13  --  Skip stumbles off to take a leak . Mumford takes a moment to digest that . It 's difficult . Section Details INT . MUMFORD 'S OFFICE - DAY Mumford is listening to Lionel , the arrogant lawyer who asked about him in the restaurant . Lionel is lying on the couch , talking with enormous energy ; he has a serious superiority complex . Mumford ca n't stand him and the session seems to be lasting an eternity . &nbsp; LIONEL . . . so I 'm watching Brokaw and they 've got some astronomer , this little limey know-it-all , and he 's telling how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe 400 million more galaxies than they thought there were . And I guess that 's supposed to make me feel small ? I 'm supposed to feel insignificant ? Is that the point ? Because I can tell you it did n't . Mumfords eyes dart to look at --  THE CLOCK on the bookshelf : 2:23 &nbsp; MUMFORDLionel , since this is our first session together , maybe --  Lionel is twisting his neck around painfully to look back at Mumford . &nbsp; MUMFORD --  you can sit up and look at me if you 'd like --  ( Lionel waves that off and looks away )  --  maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here . &nbsp; LIONELKind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker , are n't you ? How ' bout you let me explain it my own way . . . As Lionel goes on , Mumford 's eyes again dart toward --  THE CLOCK : still 2:23 ! Hold on it . Finally , it moves . Mumford 's eyes dart toward his desk --   --  14  --  A deadly-looking letter opener in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendition of Arthur 's stone . &nbsp; LIONEL . . . and in the dream , it 's always the same , I wake up in my room from when I was I kid in Ohio , and I realize this is the day of the big exam at school . . . Mumford 's head rocks slowly back for a moment as if he 's going to drift off . He snaps back to life and stares hard at the top of Lionel 's head , where there is a bald spot starting to take hold . The sound of LIONEL 'S VOICE begins to echo --  &nbsp; LIONEL . . . which is no problem for me , because I remembered it was coming and I 've attended every class , so I 'm totally prepared . Then I see myself running down the hall at school . . . MUMFORD 'S GLANCE FLASHPANS from Lionel 's bald spot to the gleaming letter opener . Mumford closes his eyes . We CUT TO : INT . HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY A boy , unmistakably the Young Lionel , runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S DREAM has a BLUE TINT . &nbsp; LIONEL ( VO ) . . . but it 's not really my school --  and this is very interesting --  it 's the school from the next district --  &nbsp; MUMFORD ( VO )  - -  Go on ! INT . HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY Young Lionel comes breathlessly in the classroom door and stares alarmed . &nbsp; LIONEL ( VO ) And even though I arrive a little bit early , everybody 's already there . But the surprising part is --  WHAT YOUNG LIONEL SEES : Everyone in the class , including the Teacher in the front , is naked . The Teacher holds out an exam toward Young Lionel .  --  15  --  &nbsp; LIONEL ( VO )  --  I 'm the only one who 's prepared ! CUT TO : INT .

But I do n't kick them out . . . &nbsp; MUMFORDSee that sign --  We retain the right to refuse service to anyone . I 'm not going to charge you for this session , but I do n't want to see you back here . Lionel looks around , but there is no such sign . He does spot Althea watching the show from the couch . &nbsp; LIONELDo n't you at least have a back door I can use ? &nbsp; MUMFORDCome out this way . There 's no shame in getting a little therapy . . . is there , Althea ? Althea stands up , smiling . She thinks Mumford is the bee 's knees . &nbsp; ALTHEANot at all . It takes guts , Lionel . Lionel steams by them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us do n't need this crap ! &nbsp; MUMFORDAnd it 's the Hubble Telescope , not the Himball Telescope . Lionel bangs out the front door .

MUMFORD 'S OFFICE - DAY Althea is sobbing . Mumford hands her a new Kleenex from the box next to the couch . She wads it with her current one and tries to stop crying . Mumford settles back in his chair , patient . &nbsp; ALTHEAWhat do they want from me ? ( more sobbing ) What have I done that 's so wrong ? ( pulling it together ) They act as though they do n't have their own peculiar things . . . They do ! Believe me . Everybody 's got something . . . ( looks at Mumford ) Even you probably have things . &nbsp; MUMFORDMe more than most . &nbsp; ALTHEAWhy are they ganging up against me ? &nbsp; MUMFORDI 'm not sure . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids , you know , not Jeremy . He had nothing to do with this --  except pay , of course . He 's always willing to pay . He 's extremely generous .

( a beseeching look ) What do you think about that ? &nbsp; MUMFORDGood kids . Althea stares at him a long moment . She knows he 's right . Tears well up in her eyes and roll down her cheeks . She grabs another Kleenex . In the midst of the torrent she tries to talk , but it 's undecipherable : &nbsp; ALTHEAMmmmfffstttubll abbittmm . &nbsp; MUMFORDHmm ?

He 's late . The modest houses are close together on this pretty street , which rises out of the main business district , seen beyond Mumford . EXT . THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC Mumford comes to the house where he lives . He heads down the driveway toward the stairs that lead up to his apartment . The front yard is completely fenced . Lily , the owner of the restaurant , is almost visible in there working among the greenery of a lush garden . Her friendly dog , AINGE , sees Mumford , leaps easily over the fence and does a circle around Mumford , who has no free hand to pet him .  --  18  --  &nbsp; MUMFORDHow ya doin ' , Ainge ? Evenin ' , Lily . &nbsp; LILYDoc. ( does n't look up ) Ainge . . . The dog leaps gracefully back into the yard . Mumford hurries up the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and puts the bags down on the kitchen counter . He goes directly to the table by his main chair and picks up the TV remote . He switches it on and changes the channel . The opening segment of UNSOLVED MYSTERIES is just beginning . It previews the stories on that evening 's episode --  disappearances and unclosed cases --  with Robert Stack hosting . CLOSE ON MUMFORD 'S FACE as he watches .

Cook nods , but looks worried . &nbsp; COOKI 'm not sure she 'll come . She 's in a mood . Do you ever go to somebody 's house ?  --  20  --  &nbsp; MUMFORDGenerally that does n't work out so well . It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change . Cook is quick to agree ; he does n't want to make waves . But he 's worried . Section Details EXT .

He acknowledges Mumford and then sighs as he steps aside to reveal , sitting exhausted in a chair , his daughter --  SOFIE --  a young woman whose actual appearance is somewhat disguised at present by her wan , ashen visage .

He 's a truly kind person , which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story . He 's the opposite of me , I guess --  all stamina and resolve . It 's taken all her energy to say this and she sinks down a bit into the couch . &nbsp; MUMFORDWhen did you start to feel this way ? &nbsp; SOFIEAbout six months ago , I guess it is now . God , it seems like years . What a bore ! I 'm embarrassed by it . Before this happened --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing --  I thought it was a bunch of bullshit .

She saw him clearly . &nbsp; SOFIEThat 's okay . Maybe it is . My mother always says --  " Everything that 's wrong with you is in your head . " I suppose that 's true . &nbsp; MUMFORDBack when this started , was there anything unusual happening in your life ? A change of job , of living situation . . . a loss of some kind ? &nbsp; SOFIENo. . . but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final . That 's not too suspicious , is it ? . . . But it was n't like I was feeling bad about the divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is that a professional opinion ? &nbsp; MUMFORDHmm , as in --  that 's interesting .

That 's never been my strong suit .

You did the training and just never got the degree ? &nbsp; MUMFORDNo. . . no training . &nbsp; SKIP ( hopeful ) Psych major ? &nbsp; MUMFORDEnglish Lit . &nbsp; SKIPJeez , man . But you 're good at it ! &nbsp; MUMFORDI understand what it 's like to want to leave a problem behind . That 's all most people are looking to do . ( shrugs ) Mainly , I listen . He heads inside . &nbsp; SKIPWhere ya going ? I 've got a million questions . &nbsp; MUMFORDSee you Thursday . . . regular time . Mumford goes inside . Skip nods , head spinning . Section Details EXT . NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - SUNRISE Mumford and Sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first light . Mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers around his neck . At each house , he consults the list in his hand , then hands Sofie a rolled-up paper , which she throws --  with varying success --  toward the front doors . The activity is tiring for her , but she 's committed . &nbsp; SOFIE. . . so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into the mountains . . . ( she tosses a paper , grunting ) . . . and this trip is everything it 's cracked up to be . . . an open car , great views , the mountain air blowing through . We 're sitting there , married for six  --  68  --  years , and he says how he likes it better when I put my hair back . . . Mumford hands her another paper , which she heaves with all her limited strength , missing the front porch badly . Mumford , who ca n't get enough of watching her , does n't notice at first . &nbsp; SOFIEThat was n't so good . Mumford snaps out of it . He goes up on the lawn and flips the paper deftly onto the porch . As they continue --  &nbsp; MUMFORDYou 're doing great . &nbsp; SOFIEI do n't know if I 'm going to make it the whole way . &nbsp; MUMFORDIt does n't matter . Go on . &nbsp; SOFIEOh. . . this makes me sound irrational , which is probably right , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millionth time he 'd told me about some preference of his . Well , I was so . . . tired of it . ( memories ) Seems like my whole life someone 's been telling me . . . I 'm just not getting it right . Can we rest for a second ? She leans against the iron handrail on some front steps , breathing hard . &nbsp; SOFIEYou 're purposely making me talk while we do this . . . ( Mumford nods ) . . . because you think this is good for me. . . ( nods again ) . . . and you 're a sadistic bastard . . . &nbsp; MUMFORDYes . &nbsp; SOFIE. . . who thinks there 's nothing really wrong with me.  --  69  --  &nbsp; MUMFORDOh , there 's something wrong with you , all right . Especially after hearing that dream of yours , about the Roto-Rooter . She laughs . They 're playing with each other . &nbsp; SOFIEThat was really bad , was n't it ? &nbsp; MUMFORDDisgusting . &nbsp; SOFIEAnd I 'll bet you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trained professional . Sofie starts walking again , taking another newspaper from his sack . He points to the next house . &nbsp; SOFIEI hate those dreams where everything means something . Sofie heaves the paper squarely onto the porch . She turns to him with pride , but when she sees the way he looks at her , she glances away , uncomfortable . &nbsp; MUMFORDIs that when you split up ? &nbsp; SOFIENo , that 'd be a good story , but that was just the beginning of the end . We went on for another year or so . Mumford hands her another paper and indicates the next house . &nbsp; SOFIESo whose route is this ? &nbsp; MUMFORDBrady Peck 's . Fourteen years old . Lives next door . &nbsp; SOFIEAnd he 's where ?  --  70  --  &nbsp; MUMFORDIn the capitol for Boy 's Nation . Five days . Why ? &nbsp; SOFIE ( heaves another paper ) I 'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this . How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old ? &nbsp; MUMFORDYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MUMFORDThen you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning . &nbsp; SOFIEAnd this is legitimate therapy ? &nbsp; MUMFORDTherapy ? Hell no , I just do n't want to do it alone . Section Details INT . MUMFORD 'S OFFICE - DAY TIGHT ON RAPID SERIES OF IMAGES on slick , glossy magazine pages : each change of image is punctuated by the AMPLIFIED SNAP of the page being turned , like a gunshot . We 're SO CLOSE to the images we ca n't tell when the magazines change --  from Glamour to Vogue to Us to Mademoiselle to W to Vanity Fair . And it does n't matter . Whether the images are ads or fashion spreads or celebrity candids , the look is the same --  jaded , hip , disinterested , apathetic , either impossibly buff or anorexic , but always severely beautiful . The PAGE TURNING starts at a fevered pitch and becomes even more intense . Finally --  &nbsp; MUMFORD ( VO ) What is it , Nessa ? The IMAGES CONTINUE . &nbsp; NESSA ( VO ) Is n't she amazing ? That is such a wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want me to see ?  --  71  --  &nbsp; NESSA ( VO ) Just chill for a second . Look at this guy , it appears he 's actually dead . . . but gorgeous . Mumford is sitting next to Nessa on the couch . At their feet is a mess of magazines . Nessa discards one and immediately starts flipping through a new one beneath it . She is very agitated . Mumford stands up , walks over and sits in his chair . &nbsp; NESSAWhat are you doing ? We 're not done . I just need to find the thing . . . &nbsp; MUMFORDIf you do n't want to have a session today , it 's okay . &nbsp; NESSAI want to have the session . I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me . But I guess you 're not into it . . . which we already knew . &nbsp; MUMFORDWhat happened today ? &nbsp; NESSAWhat are you talking about ? &nbsp; MUMFORDWas it something that happened at school ? &nbsp; NESSA ( petulant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; MUMFORDTrue . Should we stop them ? A look of panic crosses Nessa 's face , but she instantly hides it , busily taking out cigarette and lighter , which she does n't use . Instead , she lies down on the couch , balancing the closed magazine on her chest . &nbsp; NESSAI do n't think you know what you 're talking about . &nbsp; MUMFORDUh-huh.  --  72  --  &nbsp; NESSAThis shrink school you went to . . . did you hear about it on an infomercial ? Mumford waits . Nessa refers to the magazine beneath her chin . &nbsp; NESSAI want to live in the world these people are in . No one ever says anything in there , have you noticed ? So they 're very cool . Like they 're all really deep . It 's when people start talking that everything goes to shit . Nessa suddenly seems on the edge of tears , but beats it back . &nbsp; NESSAThere 's this kid at school . . . Martin Brockett . He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . . . Who appointed him my spiritual leader ? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle ? And why 's he spend all his time chasing after me ? Probably thinks I 'm gon na give him a hummer . . . &nbsp; MUMFORDDo you think that 's what he wants ? &nbsp; NESSA ( after a beat ) No . I do n't know what he wants . But I know I do n't like being watched . Nobody 's ever paid any attention to what I did , and I liked it just fine . Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself ? ( a beat ) Fuck him . Look in a mirror , bozo . Section Details EXT . LILY 'S CAF , MAIN STREET - DAY Mumford crosses the street from his office . A huge bus with " APPLEJACK TOURS " on the sides , is disgorging its passengers , a large group of elderly JAPANESE WOMEN , all of whom file neatly into Lily 's Caf . Lily stands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal ? Lily continues her welcomes , but points out a hand-lettered sign in her front window --  " Closed for Lunch . See you tomorrow . "  --  73  --  &nbsp; LILYThey come through a few times each year . ( greeting one cheerily ) Hello , Mrs. Saito , good to see you again ! ( back to Mumford ) It 's a tour . &nbsp; MUMFORDWhere am I supposed to eat ? &nbsp; LILYYou 're on your own today , honey . Mumford 's attention is suddenly drawn to something across the street . He glances thoughtfully at Lily for a moment , then back out there . WHAT HE SEES : Skip is once again zipping down the street on his skateboard in the midst of traffic . He has not noticed Mumford . &nbsp; MUMFORD ( OS ) Hey , Skip ! Skip looks over , then immediately changes course toward them , barely checking the surrounding traffic . He is extraordinarily skillful . When he gets to the curb , he pulls a snazzy board-flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SKIPDoc . Skip notices the tour members filing by , but is immediately distracted by the presence of Lily , who 's a little excited to meet the local celebrity . &nbsp; MUMFORDLily , I want you to meet Skip . Skip , Lily . &nbsp; LILYIt 's a pleasure to meet you . &nbsp; SKIP ( flustered ) Yeah . . . me you , too . . . I was at your house . . . &nbsp; LILYOh ? &nbsp; SKIPUpstairs , with Doc . . . Yeah , it 's very nice . . . I heard your shower .  --  74  --  Skip ca n't believe what he just said . Neither can the other two , actually . Mumford ca n't stop himself from laughing , but he cuts it off fast . Lily blushes , but Skip 's agitation has charmed her . Something 's happening here . &nbsp; LILYI 've seen you going by on your board , but I did n't realize --  you 're so young . . . to be so . . . &nbsp; SKIPWhat ? &nbsp; MUMFORD. . . so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . so accomplished . &nbsp; SKIPI may be young , but Doc can tell you , I 'm very immature . He 's making a joke and it represents quite a recovery . They 're all relieved . Then there 's an awkward silence . Skip watches the last of the tour enter the restaurant . &nbsp; SKIPSo , is this like a Japanese restaurant ? &nbsp; LILYI 'd better get in there . &nbsp; SKIPThat 's a lot of people all at once . &nbsp; LILYIt 's okay . They pre-order . There 's a choice of three entrees . &nbsp; SKIPWhat are they ? Lily gives him a careful look : Is he really interested ? There 's something about him . . . &nbsp; LILYMeat loaf , turkey quesadillas , or salad nicoise . &nbsp; SKIPSalad nicoise ? I love salad nicoise.  --  75  --  &nbsp; LILY ( giggling ) You do ? &nbsp; SKIPYeah . &nbsp; LILYWell , come on in . She motions him in and starts to follow . Mumford makes a " what about me ? " sound . Lily , grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sidewalk . &nbsp; DELBANCO ( OS ) Dr. Mumford . Mumford turns to find Dr. Delbanco and Phyllis Sheeler , the shrinks Lionel had conferred with , standing nearby . It takes a moment for Mumford to remember Delbanco . Finally , shaking hands --  &nbsp; MUMFORDDr . Delbanco . It 's nice to see you again . &nbsp; DELBANCOI do n't think you know Dr. Sheeler . She 's the other therapist here in town . &nbsp; MUMFORD ( shaking her hand ) Of course . . . I 've heard great things about you . &nbsp; SHEELERThank you . &nbsp; DELBANCOYou never got back to me . ( Mumford does n't understand ) . . . I called to say we 'd like to take you out for a meal ? . . . Kind of a professional welcome . Mumford makes a show of remembering . &nbsp; MUMFORDForgive me , please . What a gracious thought . We must do that . &nbsp; SHEELERWhen ?  --  76  --  &nbsp; MUMFORDWhy do n't I call you when I 've got my calendar in front of me ? &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The other two nod in unison . Mumford considers , trapped . Section Details INT . THE LANTERN AND THE LAMB RESTAURANT - DAY The town 's upscale dining spot . Mumford , Delbanco and Sheeler are in a red leather booth . Sheeler listens with rapt , admiring attention as Delbanco speaks --  &nbsp; DELBANCO. . . annihilation anxieties engendered by bad experiences with a depriving mother . . . but no one can escape the fear of death . It is , as Henry James put it , " the worm at the core . " Try as we may to forget or ignore our mortality , James said --  ( theatrically )  --  " the skull will grin in at the banquet . " Mumford nods appreciatively . ( He really is an extraordinary listener . ) Delbanco catches his own vanity in Sheeler 's adoring gaze and becomes self-conscious --  &nbsp; DELBANCOI 've run on . Forgive me . We 're here to talk about you . &nbsp; MUMFORDAre we ? &nbsp; SHEELER ( covering ) What Ernest means , I think , is we 're very interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're great believers in learning from each other . I 've learned so much from Ern --  Dr. Delbanco . . . &nbsp; DELBANCO . . . And I from Phyllis .  --  77  --  &nbsp; SHEELER ( back to a previous thread ) So . . . the University of Kentucky . Who runs the program down there ? &nbsp; MUMFORDMy mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum . Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo . &nbsp; DELBANCOI think I 've heard of him . . . a disciple of Rothberg , was n't he ? Mumford 's response , and all that follow , is calm and pleasant . &nbsp; MUMFORDIt 's possible . I do n't know about that . &nbsp; SHEELERI suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area ? &nbsp; MUMFORDLots of institutions . My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible --  prisons , clinics , half-way houses . For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall . Had a little spot next to the yogurt place . &nbsp; DELBANCOInteresting approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . She passed last year in a train wreck . Damned Amtrak . Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look . Sheeler adopts a " casual " tone --  &nbsp; SHEELERI trained in the east , myself --  Cornell --  and I do n't care what anyone says , there really are regional differences . I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing . . . Did you ? &nbsp; MUMFORDOh , yeah , very tough . But I guess that 's good . . . to keep out the quacks.  --  78  --  &nbsp; SHEELERWhich examiner did you have ? I probably know him . &nbsp; MUMFORDWallace Franklin . . . from Greensburg . A dark look comes over Sheeler 's face for a moment . &nbsp; SHEELERThat was a terrible thing . &nbsp; MUMFORD ( agrees ) I do n't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport . &nbsp; DELBANCO ( back on track ) We 're interested in any new therapies . How would you characterize your approach ? &nbsp; MUMFORDMy approach ? &nbsp; SHEELERYes. . . your particular approach . &nbsp; MUMFORDI do n't have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . See , I think there 's not much that can be done about most problems . . . they 're too complicated , too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them . The most I can do , usually , is look and listen real closely , try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody 's got . If I can get a sense of that , well then , maybe . . . just maybe , I can help them out a little . Mumford sits back , considering the couple across the table . His gaze is so crystalline that , after a moment , they become uncomfortable and steal a glance at each other . Finally --  &nbsp; DELBANCOI see . Section Details INT . MUMFORD 'S OFFICE - DAY CLOSE ON Althea Brockett . &nbsp; ALTHEA -- The argument had nothing to do with it .  --  79  --  &nbsp; MUMFORD ( OS ) I understand .

What are they ? &nbsp; ALTHEAOh , all the great writers --  Shakespeare , Charles Dickens , Moby Dick . . . those people . Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents . It 's a magnificent set --  and only $33.50 per volume . Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99 . &nbsp; MUMFORD ( OS ) One hundred books ? &nbsp; ALTHEAIt 's irrelevant . It had nothing to do with what happened . &nbsp; MUMFORD ( OS ) What happened ? Althea is sitting on the couch facing Mumford . She has a bulky knit cardigan sweater hugged tightly around her  --  the only sign that she 's not completely calm . &nbsp; ALTHEAWe argued on Sunday . He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week , like always . But on Thursday , when he normally comes home , he did n't . Did n't call either . Not till Saturday afternoon . &nbsp; MUMFORDYou must have been concerned . &nbsp; ALTHEAIt 's happened before . ( a beat ) I 'm shocked by how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

He said it was n't working for him any more . That it had n't " worked for him " for quite a while . . . You know what I regret the most ? I 'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name . He was an acquirer. ( off Mumford 's look ) He liked to acquire things . Mumford looks away . Althea realizes what he 's thinking . &nbsp; ALTHEAYou think that has something to do with my problem ? Ordering all those things ? . . . It had n't occurred to Mumford , but it 's an interesting thought . &nbsp; ALTHEA . . . Like I was on some kind of campaign to out-acquire him . . . ( excited now , playing it out ) . . . If I was just an acquisition to him , and he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . &nbsp; ALTHEAThat ca n't be it . It 's too simple . And besides , I still like it . This morning I ordered a marble turtle cheese board from The Horchow Collection . ( an odd look ) Can I tell you something just awful ? You know how people who are just assholes will sometimes look at a woman who 's got problems and say , " What she needs is a good shtupping ! " ? Mumford nods . &nbsp; ALTHEAWell , there may be something to that . Jeremy did n't keep up his end --  Oh , what difference does it make ? ( suddenly ) Why do I feel elated ? Am I in denial ? You know what it feels like ? . . . She glances at her watch , then starts talking fast --   --  81  --  &nbsp; ALTHEAI know my time 's up , but I 've got to get this out while I 've got hold of it --  &nbsp; MUMFORDTake your time . &nbsp; ALTHEA ( no slowing down )  --  When I was in high school , the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of --  was a hall pass . That 's all I wanted . I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there . . . And that 's how I feel right now . . . Like I have some giant , all-day hall pass . She is beaming , but suddenly becomes self-conscious . She stands up abruptly , flushed . &nbsp; ALTHEAMy god , did it just get hot in here or what ? She takes off the bulky sweater and bends to pick up her purse . She is wearing a simple cotton dress that buttons up the front and hugs her body . WE SEE for the first time what all her other outfits have hidden : Althea has a terrific , voluptuous figure . &nbsp; ALTHEASee you next time . I 'll probably be a basket case by then . She heads toward the door to the waiting room . Mumford indicates the back door . &nbsp; MUMFORDYou can go out there if you like . . . &nbsp; ALTHEA ( quoting Mumford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy " , right , Doc ? She opens the door to the waiting room , startling Henry Follett , who jumps up from a chair out there , magazine still in hand . INT . WAITING ROOM , MUMFORD 'S OFFICE - DAY Follett is embarrassed to be discovered here . But that 's secondary to the impact Althea 's current appearance --  sexy body framed in the doorway --  is having on him . She 's been a customer  --  82  --  in his store , but he 's seeing her now as if for the first time . All his libidinous buttons are being pushed . Althea breezes by , oblivious to his reaction . &nbsp; ALTHEAHello , Mr. Follett . Have a good session . Bye , Doc . She goes out . &nbsp; MUMFORDHenry . . .

They approach a heavy steel door , the entrance to Skip 's Workshop . A VERY OLD SECURITY AIDE sits at the end of the intersecting hallway , watching this area . Skip shouts down there --  &nbsp; SKIPIt 's just me , Dino ! The old man nods , barely awake . &nbsp; MUMFORDSkip , I 've got a problem and I need some advice . &nbsp; SKIPYou want my advice ? Far out ! Skip puts his hand in a scanning device in the wall . Some lights blink and the heavy metal door pops open a few inches . Skip has to put all his weight into opening the door . He hesitates , suddenly concerned --  &nbsp; SKIPI hope nothing you 're about to see will shake your faith in me . Mumford reassures him with a look .

THE CYBER SECTION : A dizzying array of computers and screens , some showing wire-form outlines of body parts in repeated motion . Above them , on a huge corkboard , hundreds of computer generated renderings of skin , eyes , limbs , sexual organs .  --  84  --  THE BODY PARTS SECTION : Medical models of teeth , eyes , lips , limbs . Hundreds of porn store samples : plastic dildos , rubber vaginas , sucking machines and sundry genitalia .

Skip leans back against the table and accidentally hits a button . The pelvic section begins to hump , slowly and sensually , in place . It 's amazingly life-like , but it makes a mechanical WHIRRING SOUND . Skip fumbles to turn it off . &nbsp; SKIPSorry . . . &nbsp; MUMFORDWow . Skip gets the pelvis switched off and turns back to Mumford . &nbsp; SKIPI 'm here for you , Doc . &nbsp; MUMFORDSkip , you know that it 's improper --  completely unethical --  for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients ? &nbsp; SKIPI guess that makes sense . &nbsp; MUMFORDYes , yes it does . . . Mumford sinks into silence . He begins to wander the room . &nbsp; SKIPYou 've fallen in love with one of your patients ? Mumford nods . Skip is desperate to say something useful .

I do n't think I 'm going to be able to treat Sofie anymore .  --  90  --  Mr. Cook and Ben exchange an alarmed glance . Mrs. Cook actually cheers up . &nbsp; MRS .

That 's rich . . . &nbsp; MUMFORD ( standing up ) I 'd better go . &nbsp; BENWhy ca n't you see Sofie ? I know the treatment 's working . Mumford looks from Ben to Mr. Cook , who nods his agreement . &nbsp; MUMFORDWell. . . you see , the problem is --  &nbsp; MRS . COOK -- the problem is you 're a big fake . You have n't got a clue what 's wrong with that girl . Mumford looks at Mrs. Cook and ca n't stifle a laugh .  --  91  --  &nbsp; MUMFORDWow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Quack ! &nbsp; MR . COOK ( ignoring her now ) What is the problem , Doctor ? Mumford ca n't take his eyes off Mrs. Cook , even as he speaks to Mr. Cook . &nbsp; MUMFORDProblem ? I guess there is no problem . . . Uh , this friend of Sofie 's , where 'd he take her ? &nbsp; BENIt 's she --  Roxy . Used to work with her . I think they went over to The Lantern . &nbsp; MUMFORD ( delighted ) Oh , Roxy ! Excellent . Roxy . Mrs. Cook looks at him sharply . She 's heard what the other two have not . Section Details EXT . SIDE STREET/ALLEY - DAY Mumford carries a large Fed-Ex box down a side street and into an alley . As he passes a secluded space created by two adjacent buildings , something catches his eye . MUMFORD 'S MOVING POV : A young couple is embracing and talking intimately . As they separate , we can see that it is Nessa and Martin Brockett . Martin sees Mumford , but makes no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at just as the view is interrupted by a wall . Mumford walks on , mulling what he 's seen . EXT . BACK DOOR , FOLLETT 'S PHARMACY - DAY There is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to the back room of the pharmacy , but the door inside is open . When a YOUNG PHARMACIST appears in there , Mumford raps on the metal screen . INT . HENRY FOLLETT 'S OFFICE - DAY Follett 's private space is above and at the back of his drugstore . When you sit at his desk and in front of it , as  --  92  --  Follett and Mumford are doing now , you can see down into the store through a floor-to-ceiling , one-way mirror . The Fed-Ex box sits on the desk between the two men , unopened . &nbsp; FOLLETTWhat is it ? &nbsp; MUMFORDIt 's a thought I had . &nbsp; FOLLETTShould I open it now ? Mumford seems hesitant , but nods . Follett takes out an Exacto knife and makes the first incision , but as he 's about to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MUMFORDLet me just say something here . . . I have no idea if this is going to help . &nbsp; FOLLETTWhat exactly is it supposed to do ? &nbsp; MUMFORDYou remember when I asked you about pornography --  &nbsp; FOLLETT -- I find it degrading . Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --  &nbsp; MUMFORD --  and you told me that . Still , there 's some kind of imagery that 's haunting you and , I think , getting in your way --  &nbsp; FOLLETT -- Which I do n't necessarily agree . &nbsp; MUMFORDBut you did come to me . Follett reacts . It 's true , even if he keeps forgetting . &nbsp; MUMFORDMy guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young . Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you --  maybe you could get past them . . . Anyway , I thought we could try an experiment .  --  93  --  &nbsp; FOLLETT ( indicating the box ) And the experiment is in here ? Mumford nods , but suddenly looks depressed , distracted . &nbsp; MUMFORDYou know what ? I think this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of the box . &nbsp; MUMFORD . . . I just heard myself talking and I realize I 'm completely unqualified to be doing this . Let 's forget the whole thing . Follett grabs the box back . &nbsp; FOLLETTWhoa , whoa , what are you doing ? I want to know what 's in here . &nbsp; MUMFORD ( pulling on the box ) There 's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you . I 'm embarrassed to have --  Follett stands up and grabs the box , taking sole possession . Loud --  &nbsp; FOLLETTHey ! I agree with you that you do n't know what you 're talking about . That 's what I 've been saying all along . And I can guarantee you that looking at the Lost Ark or whatever you got in here is not going to mean diddly to me. . . ( quieting down ) . . . but if you think I 'm going to let you walk out of here without seeing what 's in this box , you do n't know much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestures to ask whether it 's safe to put the box on the desk ; Mumford reassures him . Now , with much more anticipation and ceremony than before , Follett carefully cuts open the package . THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX is revealed as Follett opens the flaps . There is an inner , brown paper wrapping upon which has been set a low-rent catalogue : " METROPOLITAN COLLECTIBLES --  Periodicals , Erotica , Adult Nostalgia . " Follett lifts away the wrapping --   --  94  --  There are perhaps a dozen men 's magazines of the late fifties and early sixties : Nugget , Adam , The Adam Reader , Swank , Dude . Plus several cartoon collections : Sex to Sexty , Stag Humor . Plus trashy adult novels of the era , with provocative illustrations on the covers : Night Call Nurse , The Neighbors Have No Curtains , Secretarial Sluts , etc . Finally , two video tapes , both of Russ Meyer films : MUDHONEY and COMMON-LAW CABIN . We stay CLOSE ON the contents of the box as Follett 's hands shuffle through it , rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards , the common thread is clear : voluptuous , heavy-breathing sirens in tight clothes ( and out of them ) tempting muscular , he-man drifters or libidinous businessmen . A world of lusty secretaries , siren babysitters , and frustrated , neglected wives . In other words , exactly the erotic ambience of Follett 's fantasies . SLOW TILT UP TO FOLLETT 'S FACE . He is transported , mesmerized , galvanized . In fact , at this moment , as the MUSIC SWELLS , a tear is rolling down his cheek . He dare not take his eyes from this Holy Grail to look up at Mumford . The only thing that could wreck his mood now , is --  &nbsp; YOUNG PHARMACIST ( OS ) Mr. Follett --  Follett jumps , startled from his revery . As the Young Pharmacist steps tentatively into the office , Follett jams everything back into the box as best he can and tries to cover it . &nbsp; FOLLETTWhat ? ! What the hell is so important I ca n't have five minutes --  ? The Young Pharmacist is cowed and does n't advance into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You told me to get you when she came to pick up her perscription . It takes Follett a moment to understand , but when he does , his whole manner changes . He dismisses the Young Pharmacist with a nod , then gives a quick , self-conscious glance to Mumford . &nbsp; FOLLETTUh , sorry , I 'm going to have to . . . ( indicates box ) . . . I really appreciate what you 're trying to . . . uh , I ca n't thank you enough for . . . &nbsp; MUMFORDMy pleasure .  --  95  --  Follett heads for the door , pausing briefly at a mirror to check his appearance , pushing at his hair with his palm . &nbsp; FOLLETTI 'll see you on . . . whatever . . . He hurries out . Mumford stands up to leave , but first looks down through the one-way mirror . WHAT HE SEES : Follett hurries up behind the prescription counter , where Althea Brockett is waiting ; once again she looks quite sexy . Follett brings her perscription up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Althea down the aisle , where it 's more private . He comes out from behind the counter , ostensibly to show Althea something on the perscription bottle . Althea leans back against some shelves in the same posture as the Landlady in Follett 's first fantasy . Mumford reacts , bemused . Section Details EXT . HIKING TRAIL - DAY Mumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail . Despite her labored breathing , it 's clear Sofie has made enormous progress since we first saw her . &nbsp; SOFIEWhen I was in high school we used to come up here and make out . I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down . &nbsp; MUMFORDThat 's what I like . &nbsp; SOFIEWhich thing ? &nbsp; MUMFORDEither one . &nbsp; SOFIEWhy 'd you come to the house the other night ? &nbsp; MUMFORDI thought I had something to tell you . But it turned out I did n't . &nbsp; SOFIEMy brother said you were about to fire me . &nbsp; MUMFORDThat 's one way to put it .  --  96  --  &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Sofie gestures ahead . &nbsp; SOFIEThat 's the cut-off , is n't it ? ( Mumford nods ) I know why you were going to quit seeing me . Mumford slows at this . Sofie heads off the trail into the woods . EXT . BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - DAY Sofie appears first , but she waits for Mumford before she steps tentatively onto the rock . Mumford takes firm hold of her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle herself . &nbsp; SOFIEYou feel like a fake , an imposter . . . Mumford looks up , sharply . &nbsp; SOFIE. . . as if maybe you do n't know what you 're doing . She puts a hand on his arm . &nbsp; SOFIEEverybody feels that way sometimes . . . like we 're not who we 're supposed to be . But I have to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; SOFIE --  you 've been a tremendous help to me . &nbsp; MUMFORDYeah ? &nbsp; SOFIEI ca n't tell you how much I admire you . You have a wonderful way with people . And you 're very insightful . I feel like  --  97  --  you 've seen me clearly . . . I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was . You 've made that possible for me . &nbsp; MUMFORDThat's. . . good ? &nbsp; SOFIEYes ! And my ex-husband --  he never accepted me for who I was , just like Mother . The things you 've said have helped me understand what a dick he is . &nbsp; MUMFORDI do n't know if --  &nbsp; SOFIEYou 're shockingly honest , that 's what makes you great . I 've never had a man treat me this way . With you , I feel really . . . listened to . ( gives him a look ) Can I tell you something ? It 's a little embarrassing , but I feel very unguarded with you . &nbsp; MUMFORDOf course . &nbsp; SOFIEThanks to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I need to find a man like you . ( laughs ) Not one who 's treating me , of course . ( full of resolve ) And I 'm going to do it , dammit ! You 've given me the confidence . Mumford is in agony . &nbsp; MUMFORDSofie. . . that makes me very happy . Section Details INT . MUMFORD 'S OFFICE - DAY Nessa 's on the couch , playing with her usual unlit cigarette . There 's an uncharacteristic lightness to her . &nbsp; NESSA . . . I mean , Doc , the dude is seriously deluded . I said that to him , I said , " If you think I 'm gon na do all that shit for you , man , you are seriously deluded. "  --  98  --  &nbsp; MUMFORDWhat 'd he say ? &nbsp; NESSA ( ca n't hide her pleasure ) He said --  " Which we already knew !

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see --  She holds up the cigarette as though it were her middle finger , flipping the bird . &nbsp; NESSAThen he says stop smoking dope . No again . So then he says he does n't want me getting together with any other guys . . . Mumford does n't have to see her face to know how much pleasure this gives her , despite her hard-ass cover . &nbsp; NESSA . . . What balls on this guy ? What 're we . . . ( too geeky for her ) . . . going steady ? Jesus . &nbsp; MUMFORDNo again ? &nbsp; NESSA ( long pause ) I said I 'd consider it . Nobody owns me . And the last thing was insane . I do n't know what 's wrong with him . . . No magazines . &nbsp; MUMFORDReally ? &nbsp; NESSAI do n't know if I can quit . We 're gon na try it together , like , you know , AA or something .

She takes a look at her watch and immediately lights her cigarette as she stands up --  &nbsp; NESSAOops. . . got ta go ! She heads toward the waiting room . Mumford gestures to indicate the back door . She waves him off . He shakes his head --  no one wants to use the back anymore . Nessa opens the door to the waiting room . Martin Brockett is sitting there . He makes a gesture to Nessa to underline the fact that he is not reading any of the many magazines lying around , then stands up . She goes into his arms like maybe she 's the puppy . He beams and looks at Mumford . &nbsp; MARTINHiya , Doc . &nbsp; MUMFORDMartin . &nbsp; MARTIN ( pulling Nessa tighter ) Did you straighten her out ? Nessa give him an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . &nbsp; MUMFORDHow are you ? &nbsp; MARTINInsane ! Did n't ja hear ? My family got five hundred times better . ( turning Nessa ) Let 's go , Vanessa .

He 's got a briefcase and a document in his hand . &nbsp; MUMFORDI did n't see you there . Can I help you ? &nbsp; GILROYMy name 's Gilroy . I 'm from the State Certification Board .

As he speaks , we PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying on Mumford 's couch --  a patient . &nbsp; DELBANCO. . . and when you said at lunch about everybody having " a secret life " , something just snapped inside me . I knew I could no longer continue my relationship with Dr. Sheeler . It was tearing me up inside . And I know Phyllis was n't getting what she needed from it . What had started as a genuine respect , I think , for each other 's professional abilities , and became , over time , a personal attraction had somehow . . . migrated into a rather torrid sexual relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin in hand , displaying no reaction . &nbsp; DELBANCO . . .

I just hope that it does n't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow . &nbsp; MUMFORDHow do you mean ? This next is painful for Delbanco.  --  102  --  &nbsp; DELBANCOWell. . . you see , when I broke it off with Phyllis , she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain --  how to put it --  doubts she 's been harboring . . . &nbsp; MUMFORDWhat kind of doubts ? &nbsp; DELBANCOAbout you . . . your background and your qualifications . I 'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state board .

Which leaves you the only psychologist in town . &nbsp; MUMFORDDr . Sheeler is leaving Mumford ?

And I ca n't tell you what that package meant to me --  Mumford stops him with a " do n't mention it " gesture . Follett accepts and goes out the back door .

I did not just fall off the turnip truck . Do you know what I mean ? &nbsp; MUMFORDI think so . &nbsp; SOFIEI know a little about psychology . I took three different courses in college . It 's true , none of them were above the two hundred level , but I took them . . .

She is starting to cry , but refuses to acknowledge it . &nbsp; SOFIE --  We had a paper route together , for godssake ! Do you understand how I might be a little resentful ? Knowing that this so-called " love " I 'm feeling is totally bogus , and just a pathetic case of . . . transference ? Mumford does n't know what to say . He 's on the rack .

Althea is sitting down at the end in a stylish suit , completely appropriate , but a size too small  --  117  --  She gives Follett a sidelong glance , then crosses her legs provocatively .
