1 THE SOPRANOS This HBO drama reinvented the Mafia genre with Tony Soprano ( James Gandolfini , in front ) , a besieged , postpatriarchal , Prozac-popping capo not truly the master of his family or his Family . But the show did n't stop there . Structured less like an episodic series than a seamless suite , it redefined TV storytelling . Watch it weekly , and it 's an addictive saga ; watch several at a stretch , and its rich vocabulary of metaphors and motifs submerges and resurfaces with novelistic grace . <P> 2 FREAKS AND GEEKS ( NBC ) Television has rarely got adolescence as hilariously , soul-crushingly right as in this bittersweet paean to Midwestern childhood circa 1980 . With a cast that actually looks and sounds like kids , not Gap models , Freaks takes teen-show stereotypes  --  nerd , burnout , clueless parent  --  and fleshes each out with humor and heart . <P> 3 BARBARA WALTERS AND MONICA LEWINSKY ( ABC ) Walters ' three-hankie national catharsis turned the impeachment marathon back into the good old-fashioned tabloid scandal it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months , Lewinsky was surprisingly sympathetic , confident , unrepentant and , well , telegenic . <P> 4 STRANGE JUSTICE ( SHOWTIME ) Historical TV movies must be staid . They must tie up loose ends . Above all , they must take no artistic risks . Showtime 's Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas docudrama broke all those rules , telling the Rashomon tale that launched the he-said-she-said decade with arresting images and a stubborn refusal to take sides . <P> 5 CNBC DAYTIME Like CNN and the Gulf War or Court TV and O.J. , the financial-news net defined the boom era with its sharp , zesty , sports-jock-style coverage . In 1999 , the business of America was business news , and cnbc 's ticker  --  seen in bars , gyms , airports  --  was the frantic eeg of a stock-crazed , mercantile society . <P> 6 MONSTER.COM 'S WHEN I GROW UP A good Sunday-football ad is about dread  --  over money ( investments ) , mortality ( insurance ) and , here , going back to work on Monday morning . In the employment site 's Super Bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want to be forced into early retirement " ) that spoofed not only the rat race but other ads ' phony , **25;9642;TOOLONG affirmations . <P> 7 AN AMERICAN LOVE STORY ( PBS ) Ten hours inside the lives of an interracial family , this affecting documentary showed the import and irrelevance , arbitrariness and inescapability of race . With TV " diversity " limited to Friends for one part of the nation , Moesha for another , this picture of ultimate integration was overdue . <P> 8 SEX AND THE CITY ( HBO ) Carrie Bradshaw ( Sarah Jessica Parker ) and friends patrol Manhattan like a Fantastic Four whose weapons include sarcasm and Prada . Maturing this year from a raunchy romp into an arch cultural dispatch , it 's a refreshing story of professional women who do n't need the love of a good man so much as want it . <P> 9 BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER : SEASON FINALE ( WB ) Like the Littleton shootings  --  which prompted its postponement , one of TV 's several craven post-Columbine p.r . gestures  --  Buffy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous suburb . Werewolf Oz 's words after the climactic battle scene  --  " We survived ... high school "  --  were a resonant caption to the year of the troubled teen .
