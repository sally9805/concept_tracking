Squeezed to the point of pain by low oil prices and overdue debts , Iran is beginning to mind its manners . Tehran is trying to convince the world that it is responsible and , above all , creditworthy . In spite of the country 's best efforts , Western officials say they are not fooled ; they insist that there is too much visible evidence that Tehran sponsors terrorists and is driving to develop nuclear weapons . Even the sober , measured Secretary of State , Warren Christopher , unhesitatingly denounces Iran as " an international outlaw . " A senior Western diplomat in Tehran is more specific . " They are meddling in the Middle East , " he says , " and they are still murdering people in Europe . " <P> Egypt and Algeria say flatly that Iran is the clandestine backer of the Islamic fundamentalist bombers and gunmen who have declared war on the secular governments in Cairo and Algiers .

" <P> There is no question that angering Iran can be fatal . Western intelligence services say they have proof  --  though they will not make it public for fear of compromising their sources  --  that Tehran was responsible for the assassination of the leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran and three of his associates who were gunned down in a restaurant in Berlin last year . A Turkish journalist who had written disparagingly of Islamic fundamentalism was killed by a pro-Iranian group 's car bomb in Ankara last January . Another Iranian opposition leader was shot to death in Rome as he drove to his office last March . <P> The best-known name on Iran 's hit list is novelist Salman Rushdie , author of The Satanic Verses , who went into hiding in 1989 after Iran found the book offensive and issued a religious decree calling for his death and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to organize Rushdie 's murder were expelled from Britain last year . In Tehran the Iranian parliament , the Majlis , reviewed its execution order and refused to rescind it . The reward offered for Rushdie 's murder has been increased from $1 million to more than $2 million . <P> Iran 's immediate neighbors are growing nervous at the way Tehran is staking a renewed claim to Persian Gulf leadership and backing it up with a five-year , $10 billion arms buildup . At bargain-basement prices , Iran is acquiring 20 to 30 modern Russian MiG-29 fighters and SU-24 bombers , along with a Kilo-class submarine . Earlier this year , China confirmed the sale of two civilian nuclear reactors to Iran , which has its own uranium mines and has reportedly been getting bomb-related technical help from Pakistan . Former CIA Director Robert Gates has warned that Iran could become a nuclear-armed power by the end of this decade . <P> Other Iran watchers are not persuaded that the Islamic Republic is bent on regional dominion or is in any position to pick a fight with a major power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you project 20 or 30 years into the future , there is no danger of anything more than petty harassment .
