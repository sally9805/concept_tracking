ABORTION IS NEVER EASY . THERE IS the anguish of the decision , the invasive nature of the procedure , and sometimes an ugly confrontation with right-to- life forces lying in wait outside the clinic door . But imagine if abortion could be a truly private matter . Say , something as easy as visiting a doctor , getting a few pills , returning home to swallow them , then checking back a few days later to make sure that all went as planned . <P> Science and politics are now conspiring to make that scenario  --  scary to some , a godsend to others  --  a reality , one that could allow abortion to be a truly private decision , albeit still not an easy one . Doctors have reported on a pivotal breakthrough in the use of the controversial French abortion drug known as RU 486 : a woman who takes the drug will no longer have to go to a clinic for a follow-up injection to induce contractions . Instead , the entire procedure will involve simply taking two sets of pills . Concurrently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies of the Reagan and Bush Administrations , which barred RU 486 from the U.S. <P> The resulting social upheaval could transform one of the nation 's most divisive political debates by making abortion far more difficult to regulate . And eventually it could mean abortions will become simpler , safer and more accessible not only throughout the U.S. but also around the world . <P> Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu , the inventor of RU 486 , and his French colleagues describe the successful tests of the no-injection method in the New England Journal of Medicine . " This new regimen , " they conclude , " is simpler and potentially allows greater privacy than any other abortion method . " In a tough accompanying editorial , the Journal brands efforts to block use of the drug in the U.S. a " disgrace . " <P> Those political barriers , however , are quickly crumbling . Two days after his Inauguration , President Clinton ordered his Administration to " promote the testing , licensing and manufacturing " of RU 486 . Until then , the French manufacturer of the drug , Roussel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had steadfastly shied away from becoming involved in the American market for fear of infuriating antiabortion activists . But in April , at the instigation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , Roussel announced a compromise : it agreed to license RU 486 to the U.S. Population Council , a nonprofit organization based in New York City , which in turn would run clinical tests . <P> As a result , the abortion pill could become available through a testing program later this year . The Oregon and New Hampshire legislatures have already volunteered their states as test sites , and the FDA is enthusiastic . Says commissioner David Kessler : " If there is a safe and effective medical alternative to a surgical procedure , then we believe it should be available in this country . " Although testing a new drug generally takes seven to 10 years , RU 486 has been so widely used in France that U.S. approval could come in as little as two to three years . In the meantime , the testing will enable at least 2,000 women to use the pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
