Extraordinary problems demand extraordinary solutions .... <p> The need for beauty is as positive a natural impulsion as the need for food - Luther Burbank I was in deep space studying the physical properties of active galactic nuclei when the astral projector appeared at my elbow . Regardless of how many times it had happened in the past , it still startled me . Instinctively , my arms flew up to shield my face , arms as insubstantial as his . I was angry that he surprised me and even angrier that he was bothering me while I was working . I craved the isolation my research provided , a hundred million parsecs from Earth with all its petty interruptions and minor emergencies . Turning away from his shimmering form , I made him wait . He could n't deliver his message until I looked directly at him . The unmoving galaxy before me was in its infancy after a bungled breech birth . The galactic core was too hot and dense to support normal stellar activity . Enormous explosions had ripped through the galaxy . Glowing gases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center as if trying to escape the next blast . In the wake of the bow shock , straight garden rows of new stars were sown . I started again as the messenger appeared in front of me , his image outshining my galaxy . Before I could react , he began to signal to me in American Sign Language , the only way members of the astralnaut corps could communicate while we were non-corporeal . He did n't begin with " Mr. Quinn " or my Corpmaster title , but with an exaggerated gesture , " #Please , let me talk# " I recognized him now , although his name slipped my mind . He was one of the first astral projectors . I noticed that he took quite a few liberties with the reproduction of his physical image ; his face was a little too handsome , his muscles larger-than-life . At least he was not as flamboyant in his changes as twofaced Jeena Ashe who portrayed herself as the most devastatingly beautiful woman in the known universe . With my own image , I 've practiced enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worn after only three decades , and a runner 's body , gaunt not from exercise , but from living a life without peace . Since the astralnauts first went into public service five years ago , we have all visibly aged . He repeated himself to get my full attention , then signed , " #Emergency ( ! ) #Sun F-L-A-R-E#Earth , light hits#eight minutes future# " and motioned me to follow him . Interrupting my reverie was not a thing I forgave lightly , especially if this was a false emergency . Instead of using the wonderful old Italian hand motion that came to mind , I laboriously signed in response , fingerspelling the words with no ASL equivalents . " #Danger to Earth ( ? ) electrons , protons , C-H-A-R-G-E-D particles hit Earth ( ? ) # " His right fist nodded up and down mimicking his nodding head . I continued . " #No#light , eight minutes , but ions , hour-hour-hour# " The puzzled expression on his face made me wince , for I had seen it so many times on the faces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to explain how the energy distribution from the Sun would be altered only slightly , and would not appreciably change the Earth 's biosphere . Perhaps some poor sunbathing suckers would need Skin-So-New . With a large enough flare , the Southern Hemisphere would see a magnificent display of southern lights as some of the charged particles spiraled down the magnetic field lines to the geomagnetic South Pole . The slim possibility of real danger was something I could only determine in person , so at the messenger 's insistence , I agreed to follow him . I was wondering how I could capture this aurora australis on tape when I popped into solar space . The solar flare was enormous , easily ten times as large as the most disruptive flare on record . We had come out near the Sun 's north pole to verify the alignment with Earth . From this vantage point , the Sun 's surface looked deformed , a round yeast mold budding . But the " bud " was much larger than the Earth . I 'm always frustrated by the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of livid curses bubbling up through my consciousness with no outlet was threatening to tear me apart . I silently damned myself for being stubborn , wishing I could have back the precious minute I had just wasted . Numbed , I stared at the fiery finger reaching out toward Earth , while the scientist in me assessed , surveyed , calculated . Nearby , the bright , spherical shapes of initiates on a field trip clustered around a teacher , the lovelier-than-truth form of Jeena , and about a dozen other glowers , most of whom I had met at the Academy in living flesh over the past few years . And , as always , scouts were hanging around , lookouts , whose duties were ostensibly not military , but who answered directly to the Secretary of the Exterior . They all bobbed over to me , waiting for me to handtalk . I felt so unlike them . Mystics ! How could they be part of the astralcorp and still believe all that hocus-pocus about projecting being tied to unmeasurable quantities like state of goodness or religious conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Never had I felt my differences so acutely . " #Emergency-Top ( ! ) , Class 1#tell to T V broadcast place-place-place#warn people stay inside must#astral projectors find all#return fast# " The nouveau-sign for astral projectors , fingers signing the letter R flying off the forehead like a rocket , usually brought a smile to my face , but this time the fright-face fit my mood . Around me , lights winked out . Jeena stayed behind . The most startlingly beautiful collection of charged particles that ever was moved near me , her face searching mine for answers that were n't there . Forced to appear completely in white , like all astralnauts , she alone did n't look older for it . Platinum blond hair flowed about her shoulders . Instead of holding a steady image , she let her soft Grecian gown and long hair blow in the solar wind . Steiner 's misquote of Goldsmith echoed in my mind : " Beauty is as beauty moves ; " and I cursed whatever strange compulsion had made me memorize an entire chapter of Steiner 's " Quotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right into my personal sphere , which makes it damn inconvenient to use sign language . Instinctively , my chest swelled , and some of my scintillating particles redistributed themselves to her two closest points . She acted like she did n't notice , but she must have ; one of the first mental skills in creating a spectral body is learning to be aware of the presence of charged particles . Either she was intentionally flirting with me or the flare scare had totally overwhelmed her Not for the first time , I wished I had met her in person just once . Her appearance must be a work of art , not a true representation of her face and form . I had to remind myself that my real body was lying on a pallet in an undisclosed safehouse , carefully monitored by my own staff . In my insubstantial form , I dared not reach out to her and hold her against me as I ached to do . But I could n't help feeling flushed with desire . She signed gracefully , as if she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands toward the Sun . " #Afraid#me  --  help-you ( ? ) # I backed off a pace , dismissing her curtly. " #Orders follow ( ! ) #help-me#go now# " In a most disconcerting manner , she first turned away , then vanished , leaving me with the lingering afterimage of her remarkable backside . Her projected perfection drove me crazy , but I resolved not to let thoughts of her distract me . Solar physics is at the other end of the spectrum from extragalactic , my own personal area of expertise , but I knew some of what would happen next . The Earth 's upper atmosphere was already swelling as it absorbed the initial onslaught of X-ray and extreme UV radiation . The new atmospheric drag on all low-altitude satellites would bring them down as harbingers of the changes to come . In a few short hours , the magnetic field protecting Earth would ripple and tear as protons and electrons accelerated by the solar wind bombarded it . If the ozone layer were seriously damaged , Earth 's biosphere could start an irreversible transformation . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me of bare trees standing tall in silent forests and of oceans brown with the floating scum of decaying sea life . I could n't let it come to that . Opening my mental floodgates to all ideas , no matter how far-fetched , I began searching for the idea that would save Earth . The Moon would n't be in a position to help ; no solar eclipses , total , partial or annular , were scheduled for the next few days . The U.S.S. Sailfin could unfurl her gossamer magsails in an attempt to obstruct the fiery torrent from the Sun with as much success as a naval schooner sacrificing her sails to the fury of a tropical storm . It would have been a real coincidence , and not particularly useful , had Mercury or Venus been scheduled for solar transit , but I checked anyway When I ran out of ideas for a complete solution , my thoughts shifted towards partial solutions . I am not a quitter , but the flood of ideas slowed to a trickle , a drip , and then stopped entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted . When the well ran dry , I floundered in space , staring at humankind 's destiny in the form of a huge , fiery solar eruption . I turned towards Earth . The United States would be bathed in daylight now . I thought of the small town where my body was lying ; the town I had grown up in . I had been able to project for as far back as I could remember . Throughout my childhood , I had kept my nocturnal astral travels a closely guarded secret . Mental wall-building kept me sane , fortified each time I saw the seedier side of humanity . Voyeurism is present in us all ; without the restraint that comes with maturity , I saw more than any child could possibly understand . I got my doctorate in astrophysics at a very early age . After the astralcorp was formed , it became obvious to everyone how I had accomplished it . I had prepared my observing proposals to the South African Large Telescope carefully to prove my radical theories of the physical properties of galaxies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual hypothesis because I had already traveled to the proposed sites . I could use a radical theory right about now . I circled the Sun , hoping for inspiration . Why did I feel as though I was the only one responsible for finding a solution to this crisis ? Was it because I was the Corps 's only astronomer or because I knew no other research scientist was in the privileged position I was , able to transfer my thoughts instantaneously to wherever a solution might be found ? Too bad there were n't more projectors . Jeena does more than anyone to find others who are capable of traveling the astral plane . Jeena again ! With the whole world counting on me and the minutes counting down , why could n't I push thoughts of her out of my head ? I pictured her at her very best during her " Dance of the Planets " gigs . Her dance troupe puts on free astralnaut recruiting concerts around the world culminating in a nighttime aerial ballet above hundreds of thousands of upturned faces . With the fervor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newcomers to join in the dance . The cadence of slow Greek sirto or zembequiko mesmerizes the crowd . Not many concertgoers realize that the dance troupe can not hear the music in their out-of-body state , but rely on the strobe lightshow to mark the beat . Standard mass hypnosis techniques are used under the guise of entertainment . In the dark , a warm , disembodied voice drones on about the techniques of separating the mind from the body , accumulating and shaping charged particles and translocating . I know it 's taped ; I like to imagine it 's Jeena 's voice . Times have changed-now the majority goodnaturedly tolerate this part as one would an after-dinner speaker at a business conference . Perhaps it has to do with the large family stipends projectors get from the Ubiquitous Council . In the hushed , darkened stadium , the astralcorp ranks swell , one pinpoint of light at a time . Then comes the thunderous finale ; the crowd stomping wildly , the scintillating dancers in a ring circling faster and faster to create a magnetic field that draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final explosion of spectral fireworks , the new recruits are ready to be sworn in . The mind works in mysterious ways . An idea for Earth 's salvation crept in while the dancers whirled in my head . An idea so bizarre that under normal circumstances , I would hesitate to voice it . I made a reconnaissance flyby of the prominence , skirting its edges , noting how it had swelled even in the few minutes I had been studying it . For years , sw perflares have occurred on solar-type stars , stars like S Fornacis , 5 Serpentis and MT Tauri . The danger of our own placid star turning monstrous was so low it was below the level of logical probability . Yet , the level of solar magnetic disturbances has increased incredibly since 1900 . People were used to occasional power outages , disturbance in short wave radio communication , and sometimes an overload in telephone circuits . This flare was extreme . I could n't help thinking of the cosmonauts who were about to get a potentially lethal dose of radiation . My idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command the astralcorp on a mad hunch . Like all crazy ideas , this one counted on speed and a certain measure of secrecy . The messenger was the first to return , just as I finished calculating angles and fixing positional markers . I set glowing balls made up of charged particles in a large ring between the Earth and the Sun , but they would n't last for long . Tuning would be critical . " #Boss# " He paused and composed himself , literally , then his arm flew in an arc mimicking the dome on the Ubiquitous Council Chamber . " #All astalnauts reassign#emergency , messages , carry will# " I could see him quake at my horn-mad face . We were more than just message carriers . My secret plan was dashed before Id even had a chance to tell anyone . Frustration at the stupidity of the Ubiquitous Council boiled up in me . They wanted so much to have control over projectors . The world 's populace had been terrified of us five years ago when we had first come out of the closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given up our freedom to the newly formed Ubiquitous Council to assuage the fears of all the varied people of the world . But this was not a political problem and it could not be solved by discussion . Selection effects demand that the people who make it to power love to hear their own voices . If they wanted a chat with me , they 'd get that and more . Boldness would have to replace secrecy . With the Sun 's seething hydrogen/helium horror mirror ing my own inner turmoil , I jumped . The Council Chamber was about as cozy as a sports arena , and just as bright . The councilors were standing in small groups , talking amicably . From my vantage point in the dome , I cooled down enough to decide angry theatrics was the most strategic course to follow . I simply did not have time to explain all the details of my half-baked plan to this gaggle of groundlings . My heart was pounding for a showdown . An upper limit has never been found for how many charged particles we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles are available and we do n't ignore the bounds of electrostatic repulsion . I had to condense myself nearly solid before I could be seen ; that ought to make their hair stand on end . For effect , I decided to appear larger than life , feet spread and arms akimbo . I bounced monochromatic fireworks off the ceiling to get their attention . Would that I could have boomed out in an echo-ringing voice to complete the God-portrayal , but instead I had to sign and be interpreted in a plethora of languages . it was n't only the Americans who had refused to learn a new language this time . " #People mine#release#for me# " The English translator 's cherry lips framed , " Let my people go . " The Secretary of the Exterior stood and looked up at me . " Corpmaster Quinn , why ? What is the situation , as you see it , at the Sun ? " The translator was still signing , oblivious to the fact that I had lip-read and was already responding . " #Situation critical#time waste ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since learning ASI , my understanding of body language had improved vastly I could tell the answer would be " No " preceded by a lot of hedging . I was challenging their authority on their home turf and in front of witnesses . Witnesses ? The Press ! One glance at the balcony with its multitude of animal and mineral eyes staring back at me was enough for me to decide my next move . Secrecy or boldness should have worked , but had n't ; now it was time to try cleverness . At the first positive-sounding statement I would cut out . I knew that a politician could never resist beginning with a compliment . " Mr. Quinn , we all understand how you feel . . . . " That was all I needed . Before the word " but " hit the air I had signaled , " #Thank you , Secretary# " and bowed out . Sometimes , I travel faster than my thoughts . An important minute of time was wasted as I jumped from one major network ready room to the next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronting the Ubiquitous Council had much more network appeal than that taken against the drab , navy background of the ready rooms . It took me a minute to realize I was stalling . Projectors would n't be sitting at home watching the news , even if their vids still had electrical power . There was only one way to reach a significant portion of the astralcorp quickly I jumped . From three hundred feet up the treetops merged to resemble a wrinkled , green blanket on an unmade bed . What looked like a one-lane dirt road ran along the trough between Tennessee rills . Nothing in this idyllic scene hinted at the vast network of natural caverns housing the Department of the Exterior 's secret astral spy network . Five years ago , they had made me a job offer , which I turned down faster than a flick . I took one quick flick now to verify that not a soul was at the Sun 's North Station . I guess the Council had chosen not to cooperate . My last thought before entering the spy caverns was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered whispers of weapons against glowers . The gray monitor room had one ugly difference since I 'd been there for their job interview : the seated operators were armed with backpacks and weapons that any children 's toy manufacturer would have been thrilled to copy . Consoles showing the current positions of the seven hundred astralnauts took up an entire wall . Alarms I could n't hear must have been jangling all over the complex the instant I arrived . Three men surged towards me , leveling their feeds . Leaving a faint spherical image behind , I jumped across the room , scanned the maps on the upper level , and then appeared as two concentrated points of light under one of the operator 's metal stools . The weapons discharged and dissipated my scant afterimage . Immediately , a pulsating blue light showered the room . Although the suited operators were walking around in it , I had no doubt that if I left my protective cover I 'd be in serious trouble . Would I find myself back in my safe-house awake with a slamming headache or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I had always thought this was the way I would die , drifting loose until I dispersed completely . I felt like screaming , " Not now ! " but vocalizing was n't possible . Whiskers and a tail began to glow faintly around me , a manifestation of my trapped-rat mood . The security team ran the film of the attack repeatedly to determine my motive , trajectory and probable return pattem . Considering the high stakes , it was n't important that my identity be secure , but I had chosen minimum exposure ; the film would show only a pair of glowing eyes sweeping over the consoles . I could n't have shown less ; I needed to form some sort of visual receptors in order to see . Only the lower left comer of the bank of monitors was visible from my vantage point and , scanning it , I noticed that one astral projector was here in the caverns , not two rooms away . Like a rat smelling a trap , I strained to see who it was . of course ! What more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being paranoid ? I knew of her recruiting work , but that could n't take up all her time . I was painfully aware of each and every time her image had crossed mine in the past five years . Outside of the school , I had always found it easy to avoid her ; perhaps the reason why lay here at the spy caverns . The DoEX used only a couple dozen astral projectors to keep track of the rest of us . Jeena would certainly make an ideal Mata Hari . At the Sun , her eloquent offer of help had seemed genuine ; perhaps I could convince her that I had the Ubiquitous Council 's approval for my plan . It was the first time I had needed to trust someone or ask for help . Yet , to take a chance with my life was to put the Earth 's survival in jeopardy . After an eternity of forced internal reflection , the blue light switched off . I had n't taken my rat 's eyes off the monitor showing Jeena 's location , and , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ca n't move a trap , and if I lost her I 'd lose my opportunity to ask for help . Jeena had jumped to a room deep in the caverns and I went in after her . She stood poised before the light terminal in a primary command center The words , " A form so fair , that , like the air , / " T is less of earth than heaven , " were written hundreds of years - ago- how could they fit Jeena so flawlessly ? I could n't help wondering why she clung to her illusion of beauty even when she was alone . When she saw me she beamed and nearly threw her arms about me before catching herself . She signed that she had searched the world over for me and seemed genuinely happy to see me , but not surprised that I had known where to look . I had to smile back . She glanced behind her at the blinking terminal , and then back at me ; her cheerful face dropping like a mime 's into a scowl . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminal , a half-dozen astral projectors appeared at her side . She named me " the intruder " and insisted that I identify myself Bristling at the waste of precious seconds , I flashed through an identification sequence I had set up not a month before . Why was she suddenly suspicious of my identity ? At computer confirmation she turned to me , all business . " #Solution for crisis have finish ( ? ) # " " #Yes#all nauts need now-# " " #-at North Solar Outpost# " she ended my sentence for me . Studying my face , she nodded . " #Can do# " she signed and then turned to the fight terminal once more . The air suddenly shimmered around us as the room filled with a dozen more astral bodies . So these were the military scouts that kept track of us civilians , and they were looking to her for direction . Interesting ... I watched her instruct them to quickly find all astalnauts and meet us at the Sun 's primary checkpoint with no que tions asked , it was like seeing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was assured they would stand ready to repeat my instructions to the crowd . Their shimmering ceased and the two of us were alone again . Her beauty and nearness tugged my mind off its track . We both began to sign simultaneously . With eyebrows down , I asked , #Who are you ( ? ) # " " #Sorry# " She looked truly embarrassed . I moved my image over to a chair , not because it was a lower energy state , but as a formalism to give her the floor . Her suddenly contrite demeanor contrasted sharply to the professional poise she had assumed when speaking to the astralnauts. " #Sorry#Me think false you#really Quinn me not sure me# " She signed without looking at me . She had every right to ask any intruder to run through the identification sequence . Her apology did n't make sense . " #Smile yours# " She looked at me , the word " smile " lingering on her face . I guess it was catching , because I gave her what I guess was only the second smile she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear my eyes away from hers , but my peripheral vision was enough to watch what she was saying . I could hardly believe the faith she had in me . She had thrown in with me and there was no going back . She had exceeded her DoEX authority-we were in this together now . Sick of being abused as superspies , the DoEX projectors were tired of legislative manipulation with no vision , and they were ripe for a change . She was signing so fast , I missed some of what she was saying , but her disgust was plain on her face and in her body language when she mentioned bathroom duty at the Pentagon . As much as I knew we should leave , I had to give her another precious minute . " #Revolution organized not#secretly meet home my Tugela Falls , but what to do ( ? ) #surprised-emphasized you U  --  everywhere Council say no to#proud# " I wanted to ask her a million questions , but there would be time to talk later . Or there would n't . Suddenly , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after our battle with the Sun . I felt I owed her something for her support , but what ? #Everything finish , then#trip see aurora ( ? ) #you join me Q ) # At first , I did n't think she understood me ; my signing is so clumsy compared to her fluid motions . She stood still for a moment , then burst into activity . I guess she accepted my invitation to go see the aurora , if a double pirouette and a low curtsy meant " yes . " She stood , proffered her hand and signed that we should be going . I wanted to reach out to her , but I could n't make myself do it . I knew we would n't have the sensation of touching . Her outstretched hand made me shudder ; I hoped it was n't obvious . Non-corporeal Merging 101 was a required course at the Academy . The memory of failed classroom experiments chilled me . My instructors " voices , " Relax , Quinn ... Open your mind to your partner ... Togetherness is divine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak directly to each other 's minds while merged , but in the tests I had heard of , it created an imbalance , almost an addiction , to continue contact . Non-CM 101 was the only course I flunked repeatedly until my teachers gave up and passed me out of their sight . When jeena offered her slender arm to me , I jumped 150,000,000 kilometers away . At the North Solar Outpost , all was awash with light from the Sun , the flare and the glowers encircling me . All different skill levels were manifest . My gaze swept over the non-segregated crowd , taking in the scattered sequence of figures from globes through lollipops , stick figures , paper dolls , gumbies , puppets and marionettes to the artistry of the woman at my side . Dressed totally in white , they reminded me of the partygoers at a vernal equinox , rites-of-spring costume ball I attended as a youth . That night , I had covered my nervousness by pretending the white revelers were the projecting friends I never had . The hostess never forgave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm out . Her crew spread through the crowd following orders like a queen 's royal guard . I scanned the familiar faces as they distributed themselves in front of me , blocking my view of the solar disturbance . My hands moved of their own volition ; hooked right index finger over left , then left over right , and again . " #Friends# " I paused , surprised at myself for starting in that way . " #Energy reserves check must#now# " The view of the scintillating glowers was cut short as I leapt home . It 's a good thing I have my own power source , because lights were out on all sides of my safe-house . My estimated energy reserve meter stood at forty-seven percent . That was n't good . I had been out doing research for many hours before the crisis struck . I bumped the safety down a few notches then opted to spend a fraction of a second looking in on Grove Widmer , who takes care of me while I 'm away . He was watching a foolhardy astralnaut on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't disturb him , but leapt back . The others were still arriving . Did they all feet the same reluctance to leave home that I did ? Even Sparky , the little kid who could only form the image of his collie , looked subdued , his tail motionless for the first time since I 'd known him . It was hard not to start with a description of how filaments fill up with solar plasma then snap like stretched rubber At the University , my lecture would have mentioned the cloud of particles with a diameter of thirty million miles , heading for Earth at a million miles an hour . Looking at their fearful faces , I tried to make my gestures look strong and confident . " #Need form ring#Magnetic field cre ate turn C-H-A-R-G-E-D particle stream away from Earth# " My kingdom for a blackboard ! They were n't getting it . I tried again . I started with a slightly bent five-hand classier to signify the ring , then pointed to the location in space where we needed to form it . " #Same-same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped# " I looked at the blank faces of the artsies around me and knew I was in trouble . What good was knowing the magnetohydrodynamics of coronal mass ejections , if I could n't explain it when I needed to ? At my side , Jeena extended her hand . A shining sphere coalesced in her upraised palm . From its side , an angry finger pointed towards a second , smaller point of fight . Reaching , reaching it was suddenly turned aside by a whirling bracelet of pearls . I saw the light dawn on their sunbright faces . I guess there 's a place in our world for artsies after all . " #Thank you#beautiful# " I looked at Jeena and wondered why I used the sign for " beautiful " instead of the one for " accurate . " I noted that the inclination was wrong , then waited while Jeena 's crew repeated my words for those who were not in a good position to see me . Those under fifty-percent energy reserves I sent home to pump up till they hit ninety percent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . I did n't want anyone losing their link . Only a few blinked out . After pumping up to ninety percent , there is usually a long stretch of diminishing returns ; I had n't bothered to hit a hundred percent in years . I was hoping I would n't be hitting zero today , as my nervous group moved closer to Earth , directly in the path of the solar ejection . The glowing , positional markers I had placed were gone , swept before the storm . Instead of replacing them , we began . Everyone joined hands like square dancers in a circle , but , as the caller , I held back . Simultaneously concentrating on acquiring mass , moving back from the center and starting a slow spin was more than a few could handle . I plucked them out of the line quickly , so the momentum of the others would n't be compromised . I sent some of these " dancers with two left feet " to research scientists whose work I respected . It would n't hurt to have my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaced around the world to check our progress . One went to the press and six spread out from the ring 's center up and down the x , y and z axes to monitor the alignment of the spinning band with respect to the Earth-Sun line . The circle of dancers was expanding slowly , but , instead of following the law of conservation of angular momentum , they were visibly gaining speed . I flitted back and forth across the ring , encouraging , ordering , cajoling , doing everything short of physically pushing to keep the formation tight . I matched velocities with a gumby who was out of step . Since we were in the same frame of reference , no nearby motion was visible except our signing . " #Pace keep up# " His form was drawn in thick strokes ; he barely had enough finesse to sign intelligibly . He freed his hands to communicate with me.

It was logical to set up my temporary headquarters in front of her . She had chosen to stay life-sized and had amassed the particles she was dragging through space into a huge , flat wall stretching left and right to her partner and her corner . It was there , hurtling through space , that we received a smattering of disjointed messages from the planet . Ozone layer monitors reported no significant changes yet . The press was making a massive effort to inform people on the daylight side to stay indoors , but they were hampered by scattered power outages . The Secretary of DoEK had called me the first planetary traitor in front of reporters . Entrepreneurs had begun production of millions of lead-lined umbrellas . Total protection for Earth meant including in our particle sweep the invisible Van Allen Belt with a diameter nearly six times the Earth 's . We had agreed that at my signal , everyone would stop the ring 's expansion . Gauging visually , I stopped the increase in size to focus my attention on the ring 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were within acceptable limits , but when I checked with the alignment spotters along the z-axis , I found the ring precessing like a top . At times , our electromagnetic lens was deflecting the damaging particles in a stream just in front of the Earth in its orbit . Without an immediate correction , the wobble would break the ring apart in just a few moments . I had to act quickly . The ring 's instabilities were non-damping . The time for leading the dancers without joining them was over . This wild idea of mine needed my total involvement to succeed . It was essential that I guide from within , and that meant doing the non-corporeal merge that frightened me most . There was no other choice . It took me a few long moments of terrified thought , and then I set off on my trip around the great wall of light . Blinking on and off saved time , but it put me inside my first target . I was instantly smashed with fear from my host , then tortured with a terror of failing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I flowed through , along with the necessary coordinate guidance , but there were too many of them , and their dread too well grounded in reality . Then , they were all gone and I was in a darkened church on a solid wood pew . Parishioners gathered in silent prayer . I could n't balance my disorientation with the wondrously calm scene in the fraction of a second I was there before plunging back into the whirling maelstrom . It was preposterous . They were weak and scared and they were FLICKING ! I had n't made it a quarter way around the circle broadcasting my message and supervising the ring 's alignment , before I was dragged off to a Euro-family singalong ; I could n't hear the songs , but the gaiety was catching . I flew back to the ring , trying to do my job , then was hauled to a feast in a large smoky chamber filled with torch-wielding dancers . Sometimes , I was in the ring barely long enough to align myself , before the next flick pulled me away . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in one big bed . I rode a large , gray horse bareback across a field of wildflowers . I cruised in ocean spray above a coral reef while beneath me clusters of colorful , bright spots turned in time to an unheard beat . Each time , I left the ring only for a brief moment along with the presence of the one on whose flick I rode piggyback . Each time , I felt the joy spread through me as it spread through my benefactor . It took nearly a complete revolution before I realized I was n't hitchhiking ; I was invited to share the moments ! Then , I sensed Jeena 's presence , solid as the mountain she had been dragging along through space . And , as she felt me , she leapt . Without guidance , the mass she had accrued would follow Newton 's second law of motion . But at this radius from the center , a straight line would be close enough to the proper curve for a few seconds , anyway . She pulled and I went and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful spot I 'd ever seen . Over us towered a kilometer-high waterfall raising rainbow sprays in early dawn fight . Surrounding our isolated pool was lush green jungle . Not a scrap of an ion clad her . Morley had said that in every man 's heart there is a secret nerve that reverberates to the vibrations of beauty . She signed a welcome to her home and extended her slender arms to me . The vibrations she sent resonated with my sheltering walls and sent them tumbling into the pool . This time when we returned to the near-solid band , it was my joy that spread . Greeted with echoing jubilation , I threw myself into my comrade 's ring , laughing when I heard variations of the same comment repeated endlessly , " He finally noticed her . " Each circuit I made got easier , with fewer fears to allay and minimal alignment corrections . I wanted to share the euphoria I felt . I do n't know what prompted me , but I tugged st , #cmi as I passed her . Effortlessly , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our senses mingled . Feelings new to me struggled for attention : peace , hope , love . The two of us were alone in a crowd until she tugged and more astralnauts came loose from their collected particles to swim the ring with us . Onward we flowed , gathering essences to our collective till the ring was void of life beyond our joined mentality . It was like nothing that had ever been done before . I was aware of each individual , but together we were more than the sum of our singular bits . Hundreds of minds , united in purpose , surged on for hours controlling the ring and fearlessly doing the theoretically impossible : merging our life forces . Then the depths of space blackened and perception failed me . My eyes opened onto a scene of two fizzy faces , one floating , one fixed . The messenger disappeared as soon as my eyes focused on him ; - presumably he just wanted to know I had returned . Grove held me down . I tried to sign , " #fine me# " before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painful blaring of a medic alert alarm confirmed that I was in the emergency room of my safe-house . The cold , hard surface below and the firm hands above massaging pain into my stiff , numb limbs was sufficient proof that I had made it back alive . The phone on the wall above me rang once and I heard my prerecorded voice saying , " I 'm not exactly here now . Leave a message . " My stomach heaved . Spots danced between my eyes and the background . I had narrowly made it back at all , Grove reminded me , and would need several days to recover my strength . I lay flat for a single , long hour while newscasters waved their hands and talking heads tried to explain " The Ring " in layman 's terms . It need n't be so beautiful to be effective , but it was stunning . A longing built in me to rejoin the others , but to physically move even a centimeter was torment . It would be weeks before I could travel the astral plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . In the last hour , my many attempts to find Jeena had failed . I had to be sure she was all right . Locating her safe-house proved to be difficult . Records were easy to falsify , especially for one with her hidden talents . Doubts about what we had shared assailed me before I even swung my legs off the pallet . Somehow , my pain drove out the elation I had felt in the ring . I wanted to see her in the flesh , but I dreaded finding out how big her he was . By letting her reference to Tugela Falls be my lead , I contacted a South African astronomer I knew from my observing runs at the SALT facility near Sutherland . I presented my dilemma straightforwardly , amazed both at my openness and at her ready willingness to help . She called me back shortly with results from a recent satellite site survey of South Africa which showed an old keep on the escarpment above Tugela Fans just outside of the Royal Natal National Park . It was n't much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a direction , I launched like a spook , unmindful of Grove 's pleadings . Most air carriers lacked sufficient shielding and were still grounded , but the Kuiper VII Airborne Observatory at my disposal was specially designed to block the sensitive instruments on board from a wide spectrum of radiation . I put together a hastily constructed program of solar observations , and then slept right in the observing chair as the pilot took the plane across the Atlantic towards Durban at an elevation of 12,500 meters . Corporeal travel was irritating to me at the best of times , but now it was pure agony With each change of conveyance , each downgrade in comfort and speed , my mood darkened . Still nothing was to be heard from any source about Jeena . The ring was dissolving . Hundreds of projectors were missing . The messenger flashed in and out of existence many times , confirming that the keep I was driving towards was indeed a protected safe-house and adding that records showed it had long been in the hands of a wealthy Dutch family . Prevented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verify that it was Jeena 's . At one point , he saved my life by matching velocities in front of my vehicle and reminding me to stay to the left . I found it easy to tell him how grateful I was for his surprise visits . His popping in and out kept me awake during the dragging travel hours , and at last my agitation was pulled under control by the haze of nonstop physical motion . Finally , the ride ended . Gravel crunched under my boots as I hurried up the tree-lined walkway . Loeries and colorful bee-eaters flitted among the stately ash trees with barely a rustle of bright wings or dark leaves . It reminded me of the many quiet hours I had spent bird-shadowing . A calming moment when I needed it most . Like flicking , I thought with surprise and new understanding . The ash trees were obviously imported long ago just for this impressive walk . The new , blue shirt Grove had picked for me chafed my neck in the heat . Looking at the bright , true blue pennants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Grove 's good taste in clothes . The serene walk cleared the befuddlement from my mind and gave me a few moments to reflect . I had made a commitment to a person while knowing nothing about her physically . Was her frame really so important to me ? With a start , I realized that she might not even be female . The gray granite steps kept moving closer until they were only a hundred feet ahead . My resolve was almost gone . I loved Jeena 's strength and intelligence , but she had a secretive side . Was I ready to make a commitment to someone I knew so little about ? Someone who was capable of haunting me for the rest of my life if scorned ? Someone who , for that matter , might not even be human ? I could see the twelve-foot oak doors unlatch and begin to open for my , as yet undecided , entrance . Long dead Virgil 's warning crossed the centuries : " Trust not too much to beauty . " like a floodgate once opened , words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a strange illusion it is to suppose that beauty is goodness , " and Theocritus 's : " Beauty is an evil in an ivory setting . " I jumped as the messenger appeared at my elbow . " #naut here#umbrella yours lead where ? ) # " He had set me up for the standard " Naut here " equals " not here " joke , which does n't work unless you translate it into English . I could n't disappoint him . " #me wish not here me# " With a jolt , I finally remembered his name , Paulo Remington , and his nickname , Mercury . He picked a location in space to stand for Jeena " and pointing to it , signed , " #Jeena-there#visitors never see nev er#curtain blue , see ( ? ) #never never# " Nothing was visible if I looked straight on , but sighting along his outstretched hand , my eyes picked out a faint blue haze surrounding the mansion . The color looked suspiciously like the 4250 A wavelength of the pulsing light I remembered from the spy headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her chambers . So why had the doors opened for me ? Mercury had just arrived from The Ring of Protection , as the newscasters were now calling it . He said the power outages were under control and there was no indication of ozone changes . The press wanted to interview me-but I did n't know how things would be turning out yet , how could I talk to anyone ? He hesitated briefly , then mentioned that even as the ring dissipated , most of the astralnauts had n't returned . The Ubiquitous Council expected a thorough explanation when I felt " up to it . " I acknowledged that I understood and he vanished leaving me with traces of a good-luck sign hanging in the air . Though I saw no visible sensors , the doors in front of me finished swinging open , the cold draft hit my face and dissipated my friend 's lingering token . I tried unsuccessfully to relax my clenched jaw . Desire warred with common sense . Standing before the doors , I finally admitted my obsession with her and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within that portal I would accept , no conditions , no judging . I just hoped she had found her way back to me . There was no one around and I wondered if this were one of the fully automated recovery chambers recently made available to the spectral community . My bootsteps rang hollowly on the marble floor of the foyer , as if to ignore the sound-damping properties of the two-foot mahogany crown moldings and the hand-woven tapestries on the walls . Richly colored images of gorgeous maidens astride winged beasts and knights braving dangers to win their hands surrounded me . I faltered again when I saw the face on the foremost knight . Why ... how could it be mine ? The doors at the far end of the foyer took their turn swinging open . Jeena must already be back safely . If she was n't , why were the doors opening for me ? Maybe I was on her computerized auto-entry list ... if so , my name must have been listed since before this crisis began . Before we shared our souls . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just beyond the opening , but was it any wonder that I stepped through with trepidation ? My first impression of the huge , nearly empty room was a dizzying sense of dej@ vu . Waves of goosebumps raised on my upper arms . In the very center of the room lay a curtained , canopied bed on a raised dais . I blinked hard , knowing I 'd never been here before , but the familiarity stayed with me . I suppose it was possible that I had come here accidentally during normal dream sleep and never even realized it . It was a thought that under other circumstances would have my mind whirling with possibilities . Were some d6jA vu experiences actually caused by out-of-body travels while in a subconscious state ? Chandeliers hung on long chains from the high ceiling . The myriad of point sources refracted through the crystals lent a diffuse light throughout the room . A separate light source underneath the rose-colored canopy illuminated the bedchamber Hidden infrared sensors must have indicated I was close enough ; the layers of curtains slowly began to part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying on satin pillows . On their own , my fingers found a parting in the gauze , but I hesitated . The breath caught in my throat . What a dramatic way to introduce oneself ! The figure in the bed stirred , and I hoped that meant jeena had returned to her body . The light inside the canopy increased in mercilessly small increments . At last , after what seemed like an eternity of standing near her bedside , I beheld her An unquote formed in my mind . " She walks in beauty like the light , That brightens hearts when morning breaks . " Rhyming echoes , knight and aches , fell at the end of each line in the first stanza of my first poem . With not-so  --  steady hands , I finished pulling the curtain back . The rose-colored silk screening had definitely not been necessary . jeena looked exactly as she had portrayed herself . The bedchamber was filled with a sweet scent like camellia blossoms . The bed itself must be the bio-function monitor , read remotely ; I saw no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alarms . The mattress was warm and it began pulsating to massage her into wakefulness . I briefly wondered what sitting on the edge would do to the controls , then dropped to her side and picked up her delicate hand to feel for a pulse . I was rewarded by a slow , steady , sleep pulse . I leaned forward to brush a stray golden curl back from her forehead , but found I could n't resist leaning farther . I thought it was the tenderest kiss a knight ever gave a fair maid . Her lashes trembled and sleepy lids pulled back , exposing eyes as blue as the pennants fluttering over her estate . She was back ! She responded to my kiss by taking her first deep breath . I watched her chest rise and fall under the clinging silk sheets . Her ghostly image had attracted me , but that was nothing compared to the way the full force of her presence smote me . She stretched . I 've never been thankful for electrostatic cling before . My gaze traveled up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep them from doing the same . " Jeena , " I said , my voice husky with emotion . I tried again , lightening it , " Jeena , how do you feel ? " I was sure she felt wonderful . She smiled , her smile irradiating her face . She bobbed her head silently up and down . I was speechless . I tried to catch my breath and my wits . It was all too perfect : her face , her flawless figure , the fairytale atmosphere and the way she looked at me with open approval . I did n't want to start plying her with tough questions right away ; some people come home groggy I was searching for a decent-sounding comment when she squeezed her eyes closed , tears creeping out between the long lashes . Moving her hand to my arm , she motioned that I should perform the massage techniques for emergency resuscitation we all had to learn at the Academy Touch her ? My mind balked , but my hands did n't . With trembling fingers , I slid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began with her icy feet . Her fists knotted up the bed sheets , her back arched slightly and her hips flexed . As much as I tried not to react , I could n't keep her movements from exciting me ; I kept imagining them under different circumstances . By the time I had worked my way up to her thighs , I was panting . Her form was exquisite . Her skin was perfection . Propped on the pillows , she gazed at me with lidded eyes and I faltered . We stared at each other , counting heartbeats . She broke first . Pointing up she signed , #Roof-top garden there#there two-of-us watch A-U-RO-R-A upwards there# " I laughed at her gently . " Jeena , you do n't have to sign , now . " I stood dumbstruck as she fumbled , the first ungraceful movements I 'd ever seen her make . How could I not have guessed ? Did my obsession with the ideal female form blind me to the obvious clues that , with the help of hindsight , were so glaring ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion . " I realized that she was waiting for me to react , but I was having trouble understanding why she had kept it a secret . Sensitivity and tact had never been strong points of mine ; I wanted this to work so badly I was paralyzed . I changed the subject . " Jeena , what happened to you since I left the ring ? Where are all the others ? " She looked at my lips when I spoke . " #Rest not return#no one left be hmd#I could not leave you# " she signed . She came back to me . She came back for me . Did she mean only those astralnauts with someone to come back for would be returning ? " #Many hour-hour-hour# " she signed and tears gathered in her eyes . " #First cat# " Food was about the farthest thing from my mind . She started signing about a trip to Tugela Falls , but I took her fluttering hands in mine to calm them . I hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) #Secret why ( ? ) # " I crossed my arms , fists closed , over my heart and assured her that we needed to talk for hours because I understood nothing and wanted to know everything about her . I dared to hope for a chance . In a breath , my obsession with her perfection slid sideways to an unexplored place in my mind ; is this where love resides ? Her perfect lips were soft on mine . Touching never felt so good .
