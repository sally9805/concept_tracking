Paul Robell does n't think of himself as a cycling role model . At age 55 he 's a few pounds overweight and still mending from a heart attack . He works 60-hour weeks at a job with financial responsibilities even Warren Buffett would find stressful . The demands frequently spill over to evenings and weekends . Despite all that , Robell manages to ride as often as five times each week . // To anyone who whines , " I do n't have enough time to ride , " Robell will answer , " It 's a matter of priorities . I may be too harsh here , but I think if someone says they ca n't find the time , they do n't want to find the time . If you really want to ride , you can figure out a way to do it . " Which means it 's really a matter of creativity . Remember , you 're not disadvantaged because you ca n't ride as much as you want-you 're normal . The trick to finding more time starts with knowing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to your special circumstances . Robell found his time by riding at night , but we 'll get you started with planty of easier ways-more than a dozen timesavers to spark your imagination . The result could easily be enough extra time to double your cycling time . But before you dive in , listen to another important point from Robell : " Even though I work at fitting in my rides , I 'm less compulsive than I used to be . I 've become much better at listening to my body . Occasionally when a long day drains my energy I do n't ride even though I could . But I also have to remember that sometimes the hardest part of cycling is the first pedal stroke . Once I get out there I always feel better . " That 's wisdom that all enthusiastic , time-hungry cyclists would be wise to remember . The more time you create for riding , the more pressure you might put on yourself to use it . The result could be physical and mental stress that shortchanges other important parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself to ride more just because you can . Ride early or late .

As VP for development and alumni affairs at the University of Florida , he 's in the midst of a campaign to raise $750 million . " My job is all-consuming and I work a lot of hours , " he says . " But on the other hand I always try my damnedest to make time to get some riding in . " He needs to be at his desk by 7:15 a.m. , so pre-work rides are out . He 's usually able to leave at 6 p.m. , making night rides a good solution . Robell goes directly from work to the home of a couple who have similar time constraints . He changes clothes , grabs the bike he stores in their garage , and they ride for an hour using Gainesville 's many bike routes and expansive neighborhoods . Their routes include enough steady pedaling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two main goals : cardiovascular conditioning and weight control . Depending on evening obligations , he does this ride two or three times each week , then joins club rides on weekend mornings . " It 's simply a routine , " Robell says of the evening rides . " It takes just an hour-and-a-half between getting off work and getting home to shower , and in that time I 'm on the bike for an hour . " He pencils these rides into his appointment calendar so they become as important as any other commitment-a good tip for everyone . His is a year-round schedule requiring lights during months of early darkness . He even has an illuminated heartrate monitor so he can maintain the right level of exertion .

On a recovery ride , practice cornering , riding with no hands or other skills that do n't tax your cardiovascular system . Know your needs . Let 's say your goal is to ride a century . You may assume that you need to do time-consuming 80-mile rides to train for it , but that 's not true . Most cyclists can comfortably ride about three times the duration of their average training ride , as long as they maintain a sensible pace , keep eating and drinking , and take an occasional break . If you find time to average 35 miles every other day for several weeks , you should be capable of a 100-miler . Ride hills . Minute for minute , it 's hard to beat the benefits of time spent climbing . Take it from three-time Tour de France champion Greg LeMond : " There 's no better training than riding hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shape .

Riders in this weight range burn 22 extra calories for every 100 feet of elevation gain , according to exercise physiologist David Swain , Ph.D . Drink your food .

Merge one weekly ride . If you ride four times a week for 80 total miles you can save time and probably improve your fitness by covering the same distance in three rides . The savings occurs because you have one fewer day of bike prep , dressing , warming up , cooling down , undressing , cleaning up , and so on . More on-bike time will be at a productive pace , and the longer outings will improve your endurance , too . Ride less . That 's right , less .
