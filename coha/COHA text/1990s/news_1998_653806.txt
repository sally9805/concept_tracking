<p> COLLEEN McQUISTON is an upper-middle-class homemaker , and she likes to shop accordingly . She buys cosmetics at Foley 's , a department store near her home outside Houston , and clothes at Lord &; Taylor . She hits Neiman Marcus each year at Christmas . But when she needs a lipstick or guest towels or socks for her children , she is likely to go to Target . <p> " I 'd rather spend $5 on a picture frame at Target than get it at Dillard 's for $15 , " Mrs. McQuiston said . Even as more income flows into her house  --  her husband is a chemical engineer in the thriving Texas economy  --  that desire has only grown . " I try to make more of an effort to go to Target , " she said . " You can save a lot of money on things that look just as good . " <p> American retailers know that the country is full of Mrs. McQuistons . Middle- and upper-income shoppers , the bread and butter of the retail industry , are shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They shop at Saks Fifth Avenue for a blouse and a costly tube of eye cream , then head to T. J. Maxx the same afternoon for children 's clothes or window valances . <p> Chains like Bloomingdale 's , with their commitment to always keeping half the store on sale , have drawn in lower-income shoppers who 10 years ago would not have bothered to come through the doors . But even more striking is the success in recent years of lower-priced merchants , particularly discount stores , in drawing middle- and upper-income shoppers to their aisles . <p> The epitome of this cross-shopping is Target , the discount chain that has grown in a decade to become the biggest unit of the Dayton Hudson Corporation . The average household income of its shoppers is around $40,000 a year , versus $25,000 to $30,000 for Wal-Mart and Kmart , the country 's biggest discounters . <p> It is not that the affluent have gotten cheap ; sales for luxury goods retailers were at a decade high last year . Rather , successful retailers of lower-priced goods have managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tired , overworked shoppers prefer to save their paychecks for bigger thrills like vacations and massages than to spend them on expensive baby clothes and place mats ; and if they can not afford the vacation or the massage , they go for a scented candle instead . <p> Indeed , 90 percent of shoppers with household incomes of more than $70,000 a year shop in discount stores , according to a recent survey by WSL Strategic Retail , a consulting group in New York . Five years ago , that percentage was only half as large . <p> The best of the lower-priced stores allow shoppers to get in and out quickly yet enjoy the sort of service and some of the ambiance offered by department stores a decade ago . Their clothing and housewares shelves offer attractive , inexpensive interpretations of specialty store merchandise , just a few aisles away from the less sexy but all-important items like milk , white T-shirts and potting soil . All this is wrapped in clever advertising that makes people feel that they are part of a big , hip national secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Woolworth 's where people thought they had to trade courtesy , clean stores and wide aisles for price , " said Candace Corlett , a partner at WSL Strategic Retail . " They do n't have to do that anymore  --  thank you very much , Target and Wal-Mart . " <p> Thanks , also , to Old Navy , Home Depot , Ikea and the other retailers that manage to move less-expensive goods in a stylish , witty way to all segments of the economic spectrum . <p> " We have seen a chairman of the board of a major New York company standing in the checkout line next to someone who drives a truck for him , " said Bernard Marcus , chairman of Home Depot , the do-it-yourself behemoth based in Atlanta . <p> Whole shopping centers have been designed with the cross-shopper in mind  --  places like the Tustin Marketplace , a center in the heart of affluent Orange County , Calif. , that features T. J. Maxx , Ross Stores , Ikea , Home Depot and Old Navy  --  and where the average shopper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift in the consumer psyche started with the recession of the early 1990 's , when purse-tightening was mandatory , but has persisted through the decade , as shoppers realize that there is no reason to dig their way through crammed department store racks or wait out sales for a simple pair of cotton socks . <p> " Consumers are looking to buy at the high end , where the value is unambiguous and more fun , or at the lower end , where they can get the best price and be done with it , " said J. Walker Smith , a managing partner at Yankelovich Partners , the market research firm . Stylish . . . and Disposable <p> The shift has done wonders for the business of Target . <p> Just a decade ago , it was operating 80 stores from its base in Minneapolis . Now , with 807 stores in 39 states  --  and in the midst of an aggressive East Coast expansion even as competing discounters go belly up  --  Target has managed to seduce more-affluent customers like Mrs. McQuiston , who once were but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based as much on what shoppers see  --  wide aisles , children 's shirts priced at $6 and an easy return policy  --  as on what they can not , like Target 's obsessive inventory management , close partnerships with key suppliers and a corporate culture that showers respect on shoppers , whom the company refers to as " guests . " <p> " We do n't believe that ' trend-right ' and ' affordable ' are mutually exclusive terms , " said Greg Steinhafel , vice president for merchandising at Target , during a recent interview in his office in downtown Minneapolis . " We can bring to the masses tasteful merchandise for a price . " <p> The path of that merchandise to the local Target store might begin in St.-Tropez , France , with a company trend-spotter perched on a pier , camera and telephoto lens in hand , watching the world go by . <p> Last June , the trend-spotters  --  people whose job is to find out what colors , styles and moods are hot  --  camped out in the Riviera resort town , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The verdict : the cargo pant . <p> The style was ready for 20 test stores by Labor Day , when the trend group returned to Europe . There it was again  --  that military-style pant with the pockets on the sides of the legs , a style that ended up on major fashion runways last fall . Phase 2 involved sending the cargo pant to the rest of Target 's stores , in a variety of fabrics and stylings . <p> Target 's attention to trends goes beyond clothes . The company 's trend group goes to all the major food , home decor and apparel trade shows around the world , rubbing elbows with buyers from Pottery Barn , Donna Karan International and Neiman Marcus . <p> " If they have that certain color , we want it , " said Robyn Waters , vice president for trend merchandising at Target . " If there is one item that everyone has , we want to have it , too . " Ms. Waters said the company often used the same suppliers as department and upscale specialty stores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of a lot of merchandise at Target does not rise to that of merchandise at fancier stores . Seams tend to fray on some shirts . Bath towels wear quickly . Colors can fade on the plates . The merchandise has to be hip , because that makes its disposable nature easier to take . <p> " I buy towels for my daughter 's room or a serving dish for one season , " Mrs. McQuiston said . <p> Target makes it easy for her to return often to spend money in its stores . A wide aisle that the company calls the " race track " runs around each store , and every department is color-coded  --  in a scheme borrowed from Candyland , the children 's board game . <p> At the checkout , where a retailer 's reputation is made or broken , things are carefully organized , too ; stations are set up to allow purchases to be scanned , bagged and ready to go in about a minute . " We must be rapid , " said Kenneth B. Woodrow , Target 's president . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means we do n't respect their time . " <p> Little of this would matter , of course , if the price were n't right . In children 's apparel , there are $5 cotton T-shirts with beach images , suspiciously reminiscent of Petit Bateau , the children 's clothing line sold in pricey specialty stores . " Our guest has a high level of education and she has money , " said Robert Giampietro , vice president for special projects at Dayton Hudson , during a tour of a new Target store in Minneapolis . " She gets the joke . " <p> That joke is most evident in the tongue-in-cheek advertising the company favors . In one ad that has appeared in New York subway stations and newspapers , a stylish woman dressed in black crimps her hair with a waffle iron . The point is that Target has housewares and cool clothes . In another , a lithe model wears an accordion-style lampshade as a skirt . Yes , the ad conveys , Target sells housewares , and guess what ? The chain knows that accordion-pleat skirts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important : We 're with it and we 're current , " said Mr. Giampietro , who speaks in rapid-fire sentences while bouncing on the balls of his feet . He wears a watch with the phrase " speed is life " in place of the numerals . " And that is better than taking a strategy that we 're selling cheap toilet paper . " Stocking and Growing <p> Mr. Giampietro 's kinetic energy cuts through the eerie silence of a Target stockroom . Other retailers ' back rooms are often loud and disorganized , but Target 's are as orderly as the parts of the store that customers see . Few people are even allowed in  --  Mr. Giampietro was stopped by his subordinates and questioned as he sneaked back for a peek  --  which means that inventory discrepancies can be traced quickly . <p> The company knows exactly how much of every item is on every shelf of every store every day , and is obsessive about restocking . The logic is that shoppers who find that their Target is out of toothpaste will not hang around  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel department . <p> Suppliers say the chain 's sophisticated technology and willingness to venture beyond what is considered traditional discount merchandising , like selling dishes individually as well as in sets make doing business with Target more interesting  --  and often more lucrative . <p> " They have the best systems in the business , " said Joseph F. Soviero , whose company , Sango America Inc. , of Secaucus , N.J. , sells ceramics to major department stores , including those of Dayton Hudson . " This enables the merchants to make fast decisions and good ones . " <p> Target 's biggest challenge yet is its rollout on the East Coast , where many shoppers have an endless supply chain for everything . In the last year , the company has opened four stores in New Jersey and two in New York , on Long Island , and it expects to open seven more  --  in New Jersey , on Long Island and in Queens  --  by the end of the year . <p> The region has been hard on discounters : Bradlees and Caldor are both operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago and Kmart has been struggling with its Manhattan stores . <p> " On the East Coast , everyone knows some place to get it wholesale , so there is a lot to compete with , " said Walter Loeb , a retail consultant in New York . " But I know the stores have found quick acceptance in the area , and that the New Jersey store was one of their most successful openings ever , " he said , referring to the store in Edison . <p> Target 's successful expansion is crucial for Dayton Hudson . The discount chain accounted for about 70 percent of its parent company 's $751 million in net earnings last year , and it is being counted on to eventually contribute 85 percent of the profits . <p> Altogether , the company plans to add about 65 Target stores a year over the next three years , including those planned for the East Coast . Because Dayton Hudson has little debt , it expects to be able to increase earnings at a steady clip even as it spends on new locations . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therese Byrne , editor of Retail Maxim , a financial newsletter about the retail industry , said of Target . " In terms of margins , they are two to three times the rest of the discount industry and better than some department stores . " Sales in Target stores open at least one year rose an average of 7.3 percent over the last nine months , 40 percent faster than the retail industry average . Filling the Niche <p> A few other retailers have managed to tap the same magic . And if their merchandise differs from Target 's , their marketing and selling styles are remarkably similar . <p> Consider Ikea , the Swedish furniture chain . There is nothing inherently special about most of the retailer 's furniture  --  the mainstays are basics , like white laminated bookcases . But the accents  --  fun , cheap clocks or lamps  --  can help a poor college student put together an affordably fashionable room or enable an affluent retired couple to remake a den . <p> And Ikea 's soup-to-nuts warehouses appeal to the time-pressed : They sell everything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you when you leave . " Ikea is offering a solution to decorating problems in a one-stop-shopping environment , " said Carol Tisch , the executive editor of HFN , a trade publication for the home furnishings industry . " And they have helped the industry to learn to upgrade the offerings to a broad base of consumers . " <p> Old Navy , the lowest-price clothing unit of Gap Inc. , sells mainly to families looking for basics that are cheaper than those offered at Gap stores . But college students and urban fashion victims alike flock to Old Navy for faux suede feed-bag purses that they can use for a season and then discard . And buying clothes from grocery bins , as customers do at Old Navy , somehow seems fun . <p> The commercial real estate industry is keenly aware of the cross-shopping trend . <p> In Orange County , for example , the Irvine Company , the region 's prime developer , found through market research that affluent customers were longing for a discount center but did not like the idea of shopping in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it teamed up with Donahue Schriber , a management company , to open the Tustin Marketplace on 90 palm-fringed acres . <p> " We felt like there was a niche that was missing here , " said Rick Evans , president of Irvine 's retail division , which has also developed tony projects like Fashion Island in Newport Beach , Calif . " What has made this center so successful is its ambiance . " <p> It is clear that to entice upper-crust shoppers , stores need the whole package : speed-of-sound checkouts , clever ads , strong fashion and frequent turnover in merchandise . <p> " People want to feel good rather than look good " these days , said Mr. Smith , of Yankelovich . " They figure , ' If it is n't something I want to indulge myself with , then I 'll just go to Target . And later , if I am looking for something more enjoyable , I 'll go to the Range Rover lot .

The discount retailer is not aiming for those with beer budgets , however . It seeks and lures the increasingly prevalent cross- shoppers who buy expensive goods at tony stores but who also like the hip bargains they can find at Target down the aisle from toothpaste and milk .
