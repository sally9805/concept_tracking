<p> The Rockets have a basic philosophical decision to make between now and Thursday 's trading deadline . <p> In past years , it has been the club 's method of operation not to let an asset slip away without getting something in return . <p> That 's standard operating procedure around the NBA , not just in Houston . <p> But they are at risk of that happening with Kenny Smith - and please , no jokes about Smith 's qualifications as an asset . <p> The fact of the matter is that the The Rockets have to decide if they want to let Smith become a free agent July 1 and likely finish his time in Houston . If they allow that to happen , his $ 2.7 million salary slot would get the Rockets below the salary cap and they would have ample opportunity to adjust the salary of Hakeem Olajuwon and sign Mario Elie , Sam Cassell and perhaps Robert Horry to new deals . That in itself could be considered an asset . <p> Or . . . <p> The Rockets could trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The upside of that is that Smith would no longer be at the end of the Rockets ' bench , a situation that clearly has become cumbersome for everybody involved . <p> Smith is not a troublemaker . He 's no Vernon Maxwell . He wo n't become a distraction on the bench . But any player who has been a starter his whole career and suddenly is the 12th man could reach a breaking point somewhere along the line . <p> The downside is that one of the few teams still interested in dealing for Smith is Boston and the Celtics are offering guard Dee Brown , who makes $ 3 million this year and a similar salary for the next three seasons . That 's a lot of financial responsibility to take on . <p> The Rockets are talking with a lot of teams about trades . <p> Trouble is there is n't much substance to the talks . That could change quickly . <p> The Rockets claim they have no interest in Boston 's Brown . But it 's not because Brown is n't trying . Brown is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 of his 20 points in the last 6:05 to beat the LA Clippers on Tuesday and enhance his chances for a ticket out of Boston . <p> Brown has said he wants to be dealt , and he is trying his best to make himself more marketable . <p> But in general the climate is not conducive for trades around the league , although one wild rumor had Shaquille O'Neal going to the LA Lakers for Vlade Divac and Elden Campbell . If that happens by Thursday , you can correctly assume the Magic was told by O'Neal he had no intentions of re-signing with them when he becomes a free agent after this season . <p> The Rockets ' situation is similar to the one in Miami , where the Heat is in some ways agonizing over Kevin Willis and his $ 3.65 million salary . He 's a free agent at year 's end and the Heat is uncertain whether to try to trade him and get a long-term asset in return or keep him and have the salary slot at the end of the season . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to lose J.R . Reid for nothing at the end of the season , so they took on Charles Smith and his $ 4.5 million annual salary over the next four seasons . The Knicks , meanwhile , will dump Reid and Brad Lohaus at the end of the season and be roughly $ 8 million under the cap , which might be enough to get them Reggie Miller and Juwan Howard in the free-agent derby . <p> " " We know exactly what we 're going after , " Knicks president Dave Checketts says . " " That 's all I 'm going to say about that . <p> We would n't have done what we 've done unless we had a plan . <p> It 's going to be a recruiting war . " <p> Will the Rockets be a battler in that war ? Only if they keep Smith and get his salary slot at season 's end . <p> Around the league <p> Unhappy camper - Atlanta 's Ken Norman , who makes Kenny Smith 's situation look like a hangnail , might have actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he opened his mouth . <p> Asked if he would ever play again , Norman said : " " It does n't matter to me . The bottom line is being able to provide for your family . My whole reason for playing now is to provide for myself and my family . Any player who tells you differently is lying . Anybody who says different should donate the money to charity . " <p> Steal away - Utah 's John Stockton was 0-of-7 on 3-pointers in San Antonio in last Sunday 's All-Star Game , but that was just to lull the Spurs into a false sense of security . <p> He was 3-for-3 on Tuesday in Utah 's 114-111 win over the Spurs at Alamodome , including the game-winner with half a second left in overtime . It was the third time this season Stockton has won the game at the buzzer . <p> Utah , by the way , went 11-4 without Chris Morris , who returned Tuesday after being out with a bruised chest . Morris will continue to come off the bench for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eight games , combined , that Stockton and Karl Malone missed in nearly 23 combined years . <p> Meanwhile , Stockton has 2,308 steals going into today 's action , two shy of breaking Maurice Cheeks ' all-time NBA record . Cheeks did it in 1,101 games . This is Stockton 's 952nd game . Typically , Stockton said his approach to the record is not to make a big deal of it . <p> " " I 've played on teams where defense has been paramount , starting with Mark Eaton and the things he allowed other guys to do , " Stockton says . " " When I was a younger player , I was able to play off my man and play the passing lanes a little more knowing the big fella was back there to protect me . But most of the guys I 've played with worked hard on defense , and when guys do that , there are going to be soft passes - not-so-accurate passes . When that happens , you 're gong to be able to pick off a few . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " " Cheeks was very dedicated to the game . He did not play with much so-called flair . He was one of those guys who did n't get the recognition he deserved because of the way he played . He just went out there and quietly beat you , just like John . " <p> Quote of the week - The LA Clippers ' losing streak hit nine when they lost to the pathetic Smelltics . So what does that make the Clips ? <p> " " When you lose to the team that you 're supposed to beat , it tells you pretty much that you stink , " said Brian Williams . <p> Jason and the Argo-nuts - Even though they 've been exposed as Jason Kidd and two impostors , Dallas ' three Js are going to be kept together , apparently . <p> Neither Kidd , Jamal Mashburn nor Jim Jackson will be deal in the next four days , according to the Mavs . <p> Why ? Because the Mavs are cognizant of the upside . <p> Of a possible 130 games , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The club has taken the stance that it has n't gotten a clear picture of how effective this triumvirate can be due to injuries . <p> " " Everybody wants to split up a good thing , " Mashburn said . <p> " " But really , what have you had here before ? People are getting spoiled by saying we need a big man . Say we get that big man , and he does n't pan out to be what we expect to be . " <p> Dick Motta 's read on the situation is this : " " It 's hard to analyze it this year because this has not been a normal year . A normal , fair analyzation is probably impossible right now . " <p> Remember , this is an owner , Donald Carter , who lost Detlef Schrempf , Dale Ellis , Mark Aguirre and Sam Perkins with little or nothing in return . " " We 've made enough mistakes in this organization that we 're walking on broken egg shells , there 's no question about that , " Motta said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being cautious , I do n't know what will . But does it make you too cautious ? " <p> Directly related - Is it just a coincidence that the Bulls lost back-to-back games for the first time this season when Luc Longley was hurt ? I think not . <p> Uncle Donn 's brand - The Phoenix Suns are picking up where the late Jerry Garcia left off in helping the Lithuanian national team . <p> The Suns will serve as the official outlet for Lithuanian basketball apparel . Tie-dyed warmup shirts , donated by Garcia 's Grateful Dead rock band , were a big hit at the ' 92 Barcelona Olympics and were purchased by an estimated 50,000 Americans . <p> The effort is being coordinated by Donn Nelson , the Suns ' assistant coach who also serves as the Lithuanians ' assistant coach . <p> Sending an expensive message - The Washington Bullets , terrified that they 're going to lose him to free agency , have penciled forward Juwan Howard in for a $ 7 million salary in their preliminary 1996-97 budget estimates , according to team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inform other teams to keep their mitts to themselves . If you take that $ 7 million opening salary and stretch it seven years with the annual 30-percent raise , it 's worth $ 78.4 million or an average of 11.2 per season . <p> " " That 's a good place to start , " said agent David Falk . <p> " " I 've said before Juwan Howard is going to be the most highly sought after free agent this summer . He 's younger than the others , and with a lot of the others , you do n't expected them to move . I think it 's probable that Dikembe ( Mutombo ) will stay in Denver , Alonzo ( Mourning ) will stay in Miami and Michael ( Jordan ) will stay in Chicago . Juwan will be the best player on the open market . " <p> Falk apparently wants a deal worth $ 13 million per season . If the opening salary is $ 8 million and it 's stretched seven years , it would be worth $ 89.6 million or an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-year , $ 58 mil deal , says he 's not concerned if Howard gets more than he 's getting . <p> And there 's swamp land for sale in South Florida . <p> Odds and ends - Todd Day got jerked from the starting lineup in Boston . Why ? He shot 7-of-40 over a five-game span . .. . Suddenly , the Pacers ca n't beat anybody . They lost to Detroit and Philly before the break , then twice to New Jersey . Part of the problem is 7-4 center Rik Smits . " " He 's playing like he 's 6-4 , " coach Larry Brown says . <p> Seattle coach George Karl is one expert who believes the Phoenix Suns are n't yet dead . " " I think he ( Charles Barkley ) is a special player in the league , " Karl says . <p> " " Is he sliding ? I doubt it . Their whole team has n't played with the confidence they had last year , but Charles is still one of the few people in basketball who can go 20-20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given night . I have all expectations that they 'll be in the playoffs and they will be a factor . " <p> Sefko 's rankings . <p> How the Chronicle 's Eddie Sefko rates the NBA teams .
