Pre-Columbian Meso-American music . The lights slowly rise on the altar to Coatlicue , the Aztec Goddess of Creation and Destruction , an awesome statuesque decapitated figure . She wears a serpent skirt . Her breast shield is splayed with dismembered hands and hearts . The Cihuatateo flank her . CIHUATATEO This is how all stories begin and endthe innocence of an eagle featherstuffed inside a mother 's apron . The birdboy growing theretaking shape.The warrior son waiting in the wingstaking flight . So , too begins and ends this story.The birth of a male childfrom the dark sea of Medea at the dawning of an age . ( Pause .

LUNA Medea hid from the light . She always slept in the shadows , the windowless side of the bed , the shades drawn day or night . She slept with earplugs , blindfolds. p. 5 MEDEA I think it 's the alcohol that sucks out all your juices , leaves you dry and black-eyed . The obsidian mirror and pulque . Vanity and drunkenness .

I 'd trace my finger like a dumb plow along those furrows , but I could only guess at what Medea was thinking . ( Luna bends down , kisses woman who stirs in bed . ) I 'll be back tomorrow night .

TATOO ARTIST You think that 's what you 're doing , praying ? You think this is holy , driving needles into the paper of your flesh ? Hanging metal off your eyebrows , your nostrils , your lips ? ( Removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you cut . I pray deep and hard and if it pusses , I pray harder for the pain . In the center of pain , there is always a prayer .

In her wrists , elbows , ankles , knees And every mouth was hungry y bien , gritona . Bueno , to comfort la pubre , the spirits flew down and began to make grass and flowers from the dirt brown of her skin . From her greas , they made forests . From those ojos negros , pools and springs . And from the slopes of her shoulders and senos , they made mountains y valles . At last she will be satisfied , they thought . Pero just like before , her mouths were everywhere , biting and moaning opening and snapping shut . They would never be filled .

Vain women who only know to be the beloved . Such an example I shall be that no woman will dare to transgress those boundaries again . You , you and your kind , have no choice . You were born to be a lover of women , to grow hands that could transform a woman like those blocks of faceless stone you turn into diosas . I , my kind , is a dying breed of female .

They hold each other 's eyes from a distance . ) LUNA Can I be tried twice for the same crime ? BORDER GUARD Answer the question . Do you desire  --  LUNA There was no passion there . By the end , it was a mindless reflex . The desire was gone from us months before or was it years ? We fought about it . We slept as sisters . When she began to dream and the dream was bad , I just drew her closer to me , placed her hands one on top of the other , and folded them into her belly with the unconsciousness of a sonmbula . MEDEA I am sleepwalking still . Even the smell of the sea has abandoned us . ( Sudden police sirens and the spinning of blue and red police lights .

They draw out maguey thorns , the size of hands , from their serpents sashes . They pierce and slash themselves , wailing . They encircle Medea with the ghostly white veil of La Llorona .

Chac-Mool enters angrily with an armful of blue corn . He finds a cooking pot , begins to strip the corn furiously , tossing it into the pot . Medea enters . MEDEA Why are you doing that ? I 'm going to make dinner . CHAC-MOOL I 'm not hungry . MEDEA Then what are you cooking for ? CHAC-MOOL It 's Luna 's corn . ( Medea goes to the pot , lifts the lid . ) MEDEA It 's blue . CHAC-MOOL Where is she ? She does n't even get to see it . She planted it . Why ca n't she see it ? Why did you send her away . MEDEA I did n't send her away . She left . CHAC-MOOL You did .

I wan na go home . ( Blackout. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits at the table in Medea 's home . There is a briefcase on the table . MEDEA I sent the papers back because they were unacceptable . You ignored my conditions . JASON You are n't in the position to negotiate , Medea . MEDEA I 'm not ? JASON Frankly , I think I 'm being quite generous . MEDEA To live as your ward . I could stay here for that . JASON Semantics . MEDEA I know what " ward " means , Jasn . JASON It means I will take care of you . Your grandmother , too . MEDEA I 'm not your Jurez whore , Seor . A woman is nothing in Aztln without a husband . JASON Then stay here if you want . It 's your decison . MEDEA Then we both stay . Chac-Mool 's not going anywhere without me . JASON Medea , I do n't want you . MEDEA And I do n't want you , but I 'm not going back to my land on my knees . I thought we gave up Catholicism with the revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MEDEA Love ! You love a tight pussy around your dick , that 's what you love . Why do you have to marry it ? It will not make you younger . JASON Ah , Jeczus . MEDEA You raped me . Now pay up . JASON Oh , Medea . You orchestrated the whole damn thing . MEDEA When the prostitute is not paid as agreed , she is raped . JASON You said it . I never agreed to stay married to you .

" JASON It was the passion of the moment . MEDEA And the moment has passed . JASON Yes . MEDEA Get out ! JASON Not without my son ! MEDEA Qu crees ? That you 'll be free of me ? I 'll decide , not you . You 'll never be free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medea . Not me . You will always be my woman because of our son . Whether you rot in this wasteland of counter-revolutionary degenerates or take up residence in my second bed . You decide . I 'm not afraid of you , Medea . I used to be afraid of that anger , but not anymore . I have what I want now . Land and a future in the body of that boy . You ca n't stop me. p. 74 MEDEA Watch me . JASON If you really loved your son , you 'd remove him from your tit . MEDEA So his mouth can suck your dick ? JASON That how your dyke friends talk , Medea ? Look at you . You hate men . And boys become men . What good are you for Chac now ? He needs a father . MEDEA My son needs no taste of that weakness you call manhood . He is still a boy , not a man and you will not make him one in your likeness ! The man I wish my son to be does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself if he must , but he will not grow up to learn betrayal from your example . JASON You left me . MEDEA And you sent away your son and his mother to live in exile . JASON You would not be separated . MEDEA That 's one version of the story , Jasn . Would you like to hear the other ? Or do you believe in your own mythology ? The " Minister of Culture " marrying una niita . Qu conveniente ! JASON It 's hardly convenient , Medea . I 've had to defend this relationship  --  MEDEA She 'll never call you by your true name , Jasn , so you may fortunately begin to forget it . Forget the U.S. Air Force father , the quarter-breed mestizo-de-mestizo cousins , your mother 's coveted Spanish coat of arms . That girl ca n't know you because your lies were sown long before she made root on this earth . Send me your wife . I will teach her of her own embattled and embittered history . I will teach her , as I have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Against fathers and brothers and sons who grow up to be rapists of women , tradores de una cultura ms anciana que your pitiful ego 'd life can remember . p. 75 JASON That bitterness in you you 'll never change . MEDEA Oh yes , I 've changed . I married you when I was still a girl , not a woman , but a girl with a girl 's navet who still looked for a father 's protection . But that was a long time ago . I am a woman . A Mexican woman and there is no protection and no place for me , not even in the arms of another woman because she too is an exile in her own land . Marry your child-bride . A mi no me importa . No , in that lies no traicin . Betrayal occurs when a boy grows into a man and sees his mother as a woman for the first time . A woman . A thing . A creature to be controlled . JASON If it is so inevitable . Give me the boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still an innocent . He will love you in spite of me , for his body requires that that animal memory be fulfilled . To that I do not object , nor to the fact that he must one day grow away from me , but he will leave me as a daughter does , with all the necessary wrenching , and his eye will never see me " as woman . " I promise you that . ( Jasn opens his briefcase , takes out a document , puts it on the table , rises . ) JASON The courts have already made their decision , Medea . MEDEA Which courts ? Those patriarchs who stole my country ? I returned to my motherland in the embrace of a woman and the mother is taken from me. p. 76 JASON You agreed . Age thirteen . You signed the  --  MEDEA My hand was forced . JASON Bueno , the Sundance starts in a matter of weeks . I 'll be back for the ( Spying Chac-Mool entering ) Adolfo CHAC-MOOL Chac-Mool . It 's written on my arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chac-Mool , yes . You 're big . ( Silence . ) MEDEA Tell him the truth , Jasn . Since my son is standing here in front of you , tell him to his face . JASON What are you talking about ? MEDEA That my son makes you legit , just like I did . That 's why you 've suddenly appeared on our doorstep con tus papeles in hand . CHAC-MOOL Mom MEDEA He is your native claim . You ca n't hold onto a handful of dirt in Aztln without him . You do n't have the blood quantum . JASON I 'm a practical man , Medea . MEDEA I believe the word is opportunist . JASON Yes , there is that requirement , but that says nothing about my love for my son . p. 77 MEDEA That 's right . It says nothing . JASON There are the custody papers , Medea . The divorce is already a done deal . There 's really nothing more to discuss . ( Beat ) Chac-Mool , regardless of what your mother has said to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's taken me a long time to to grow up . I never should 've let you go , but I 'm coming back for you now . Once these papers are taken of , I hope you 'll  --  CHAC-MOOL Go willingly ? JASON Yes . ( Beat ) Bueno  --  ( There is a pause . ) MEDEA Get out . ( He glances over to Chac-Mool one last time . Chac-Mool does not return the look . Jasn exits . ) Chac-Mool . CHAC-MOOL I barely remember him . MEDEA I 'm sorry you had to see this . CHAC-MOOL Him ? MEDEA Yes . CHAC-MOOL He 's old . Small . MEDEA Yes . CHAC-MOOL Why did n't you tell me he was coming ? MEDEA He brought papers . It was business . p. 78 CHAC-MOOL Did he come for me ? MEDEA I never would 've let you go . As . Without time to prepare . CHAC-MOOL Mom , I 've been preparing . MEDEA I mean in your heart . CHAC-MOOL How do you do that ? MEDEA I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MEDEA Did n't you hear him ? CHAC-MOOL He wants me . MEDEA He wants you for a piece of dirt ! He did n't deny it ! CHAC-MOOL You did n't tell me . MEDEA He 's using you ! Just like he used me and when he 's done with you , he 'll toss you back here like so much basura . CHAC-MOOL Why you talking like this ? Let 's just go . MEDEA I ca n't go . CHAC-MOOL Why not ? MEDEA Nothing 's changed , Chac-Mool . They want a public disavowal . CHAC-MOOL A what ? MEDEA I ca n't deny what I am , hijo . I thought I could , but I can't. p. 79 CHAC-MOOL He does n't want you , does he ? That 's why . MEDEA Did you just hear what I said ? CHAC-MOOL I want to be initiated , Mam . MEDEA You want to cut open your chest ? CHAC-MOOL I  --  MEDEA Is that what this is all about ! Toma ! ( Grabbing a letter opener from the table ) Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she drops her satchel on the floor , and rushes to restrain Medea . ) MAMA SAL Medea ! MEDEA Cut open your mother 's chest first ! Dig out her heart with your hands because that 's what they 'll teach you , to despise a mother 's love , a woman 's touch  --  CHAC-MOOL I wo n't do that . MEDEA ( Breaking Mama Sal 's hold ) You say that because you 're still young . Your manhood , the size of acorns . When you feel yourself grown and hard as oak , you 'll forget . CHAC-MOOL I wo n't forget . I 'll come visit you . I promise . MEDEA ( Bitterly ) You 'll visit . p. 80 CHAC-MOOL I got ta get outta here , Mom . I ca n't carry this no more , I 'm just a kid . It 's not normal ! MEDEA You want normal ? Then go with your father . He 's perfectly normal . It 's normal to send your five-year-old child and his mother into exile and then seven years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . It 's normal for a nearly sixty-year-old Mexican man to marry a teenager . It 's normal to lie about your race , your class , your origins , create a completely unoriginal fiction about yourself and then name yourself la patria 's poet . But that 's normal for a country who robs land from its daughters to give to its sons unless of course they turn out to be jotos . CHAC-MOOL Stop it , Mom . I do n't wan na hear no more . MEDEA Well , I 've got more to say . MAMA SAL Ya , Medea ! Basta ! ( Blackout. ) p. 81 Act 2 , Scene 5 Scene Five Chac-Mool sits beneath a glaring spotlight in the interrogation room . The Border Guard circles around him , holding a clipboard . BORDER GUARD What is your name ? CHAC-MOOL Adolfo . BORDER GUARD ( Checking the notes on the clipboard ) What about Chac-Mool ? CHAC-MOOL If you knew already , why did you ask me ? BORDER GUARD For the record . CHAC-MOOL For the record , my real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's my mom 's name for me . It 's written in my skin . You wan na see ? BORDER GUARD No , they do n't approve of graffitti en Aztln . They do murals . CHAC-MOOL It 's not  --  BORDER GUARD Let 's get back to Adolfo , shall we ? For the record . CHAC-MOOL For the record , I hate that name . It 's a Nazi name . Every kid named Chuy has to live up to the legacy of being named Jesus . Well , me I got Adolfo to follow me into the grave . p. 82 BORDER GUARD Who named you ? CHAC-MOOL My father , after some revolutionary , long-dead gunrunner uncle of his . But it 's still a Nazi name . Sure there are other Adolfs in history plenty of them , including my revolutionary uncle , but nobody with an impact even close to that of Hitler or Christ . I was born to be a Nazi , to have a Nazi life , to be denied a free life . Is nobody listening to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHAC-MOOL Who says ? BORDER GUARD You 're the source of conflict . You 're also the youngest one here , which means you 're the future , it 's got ta be about you . And , you 're the only real male in the cast . CHAC-MOOL And who are you ? BORDER GUARD Think of me as your revolutionary conscience , the mirror to that elegant yaqui body of yours , inside and out . CHAC-MOOL Is this about a confession ? BORDER GUARD What do you mean ? CHAC-MOOL Like are you trying to get some kind of confession outta me . BORDER GUARD I 'm trying to ascertain your readiness to make the return . p. 83 CHAC-MOOL I do n't want to be here no more . BORDER GUARD Where ? CHAC-MOOL Tamoachan . BORDER GUARD Phoenix ? CHAC-MOOL Yes . BORDER GUARD Where do you want to be ? CHAC-MOOL Aztln . BORDER GUARD Right answer . Tu patria . CHAC-MOOL S , mi patria . I am my father 's son . I 've got a right to be there . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat between my mother 's thighs . He wanted to forget those campesina thighs . BORDER GUARD Who told you that ? CHAC-MOOL My mother . BORDER GUARD And now ? CHAC-MOOL And now what ? BORDER GUARD What does he want now ? CHAC-MOOL Well , now he wants me back . To make a man outta me , to keep the Indian in him . BORDER GUARD He 's not an Indian ? CHAC-MOOL Not enough , according to my mother . BORDER GUARD And that 's a problem ? p. 84 CHAC-MOOL In Aztln it is . God , I thought you knew the place . BORDER GUARD Not really . I hardly remember . I only work the border . And what do you want outta the deal ? CHAC-MOOL The return ? BORDER GUARD Yes . CHAC-MOOL I just do n't wan na have to hurt nobody . BORDER GUARD ( Untying the handcuffs ) Nazi , let me introduce myself . CHAC-MOOL You said it was my play . BORDER GUARD You want this play ? CHAC-MOOL I do n't know yet . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I do n't want you to be a man . Men scare me . BORDER GUARD Your father 's a man . CHAC-MOOL I 've got nowhere else to go . BORDER GUARD I 'll be a woman . CHAC-MOOL Be my mother . I miss my mother . I 'm leaving her . BORDER GUARD No , not your mother . I am your revolutionary conscience . Today using modern methods I could convince you of anything . That you are no more than your father 's son . The son del nuevo patrn revolucionario , a landowner from whom you will inherit property and a legacy of blood under the fingernails . Today using modern methods , I am landless . A woman without a country . I am she whom you already know to hate . I wipe your infant ass in another life , sensitive Nazi-boy. p. 85 CHAC-MOOL ( Rising ) I 've had enough of this . BORDER GUARD ( Pushing him down again , hand on his shoulder ) It 's cold out . Where could you possibly go in such weather ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country . I am not despised as you are . There is a piece of dirt a few hundred miles away from here that still holds the impression of my footsteps . I belong somewhere . I am going . BORDER GUARD Footsteps , the size of boys ' feet ? CHAC-MOOL I am not ready to be a man . BORDER GUARD No ? CHAC-MOOL I was blessed always blessed to be a boy . My great-grandmother literally traced my forehead with the cross of her thumb and index finger and my brow was tranquil then . I did n't then have these violent thoughts of a man . At four , my father drilled his fingers into my chest , held me at the gunpoint of his glare . You are blessed , he told me . Open your nostrils and flare like a bull . I want you to smell this land . I remember the wings of my nostrils rising up to suck up his breath . It was a birthing of sorts . He penetrated and I was born of him . His land was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . BORDER GUARD Aztln. p. 86 CHAC-MOOL Yes , Aztln . And then my mother stole me away with the stonemason . A sculptor . BORDER GUARD Get up now . CHAC-MOOL ( Standing ) Did I pass ? Am I ready ? BORDER GUARD We caught you just in time . ( Border Guard pushes Chac-Mool out of the scene , then the Guard crosses to the hospital. ) p. 87 Act 2 , Scene 6 Scene Six PRISON GUARD ( Announces ) Too late . Prison Psychiatric Ward . Back to the future . ( Medea sits in a stupor in the psychiatric ward . The Prison Guard hands her one of the wilted white flowers from the opening of the play . She caresses it . Nurse enters with tray of food . ) MEDEA I have gone without campanitas on my kitchen table , I have gone without a kitchen table , a kitchen , a hearth for how long has it been , Nurse ? NURSE Many months . MEDEA Enough months to become years ? NURSE Not yet . MEDEA Without a kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything wrapped in plastic  --  the forks , the napkin , the salt and pepper , like on airplanes . I want to fly away . ( She lifts the lid to the food tray . ) Is this soup ? NURSE It 's breakfast . We do n't serve soup for breakfast . MEDEA ( Stirring it with her spoon ) It 's gray soup . NURSE It 's mush . MEDEA I like avena. p. 88 NURSE Avena . MEDEA Oatmeal . It sticks to your ribs , like that commercial . ( Singing a little jingle ) " Sticks to your ribs all day . " NURSE I remember that . ( Starts to exit ) MEDEA You 're leaving me ? NURSE I got more patients than you . Eat your breakfast . ( Nurse exits . ) MEDEA She 's leaving me . Now I will have no one to talk to . I could talk to the man on the Quaker Oats box but she did not leave me the box or the man , just the mush . ( She pushes at it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . One of his first words because oatmeal was one of his first foods . ( She wipes the spoon clean with a paper napkin , tries to glimpse her reflection in the bowl of the spoon ) I live inside the prison of my teeth . My voice ca n't escape . This wall of maize white tiles sealed shut . " Perfect masonry , " Luna 'd always say about my teeth . I wish I had a mouth of corn , sweet baby corn . A mouth of baby teeth sucking at virgin purple pezones . How do I live now without her breasts ? I ca n't open my mouth to suck her . Luna ? ( Luna enters in memory. ) p. 89 LUNA Say it . Say what is hardest to say . MEDEA I would 've respected you more , had you just left . You do n't have the courage to be alone . You 'll flop from woman to woman for the rest of your life . LUNA That 's not it . That was n't hard . Try again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good . MEDEA I dreamed our land returned to us . LUNA Go on . MEDEA You were there . It was the most natural evolution in the world to move from love of country to love of you . LUNA And  --  MEDEA There was a road of yellow dust , sagaro and maguey . You were laying down the cactus stones one by one to my door . LUNA Why did you shut the door , Medea ? MEDEA My son . LUNA No . The truth . MEDEA My son . LUNA Look . ( She holds out an empty hand to Medea ) The corn is going to seed . MEDEA Ya lo s. p. 90 LUNA I tried to warn you , Medea . MEDEA Fucking means nothing ! LUNA I warned you about me . MEDEA And your negra ? LUNA She 's a friend . MEDEA A friend ! LUNA Yes ! You 're right . I do n't want to be alone . Not now . MEDEA I sacrificed Aztln for you ! LUNA Aztln was uninhabitable . ( Luna exits . Medea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then spits it out . ) MEDEA ( Shouting ) This tastes like shit . Hey ! Nurse , somebody ! This takes like shit ! p. 91 Act 2 , Scene 7 Scene Seven Mama Sal sits out by the entrance to the projects . She smokes her pipe . Chac-Mool approaches , carrying a small backpack . MAMA SAL You should 've called me . I would 've met you at the bus station . CHAC-MOOL That 's all right . MAMA SAL I love the bus station . Everybody goin ' someplace . ( Beat ) Are you going , hijo ? CHAC-MOOL Yeah . Just came to get my stuff . Say good-bye . MAMA SAL Who knows maybe I 'll even follow you there in a few years . CHAC-MOOL I 'd like that . MAMA SAL It do n't matter no more . Lesbiana ni lesbiana . I have outlived all the lovely womans in my life . ( Chac-Mool smiles . ) You do me one favor , Chaco ? CHAC-MOOL Dgame . MAMA SAL If I do n't get back there , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAC-MOOL I wo n't Bisabuela . MAMA SAL Just fire me up como un cigaro and put me en tu bolsillo  --  p. 92 CHAC-MOOL I 'm not gon na do that ! MAMA SAL I mean it . And take me out there by those ruinas out there en las montaas de Jemez . CHAC-MOOL I do n't know where that is . MAMA SAL You 'll find out . Just spread me around out there with all that red rock . I 'm tired of this pinche city . CHAC-MOOL I promise . MAMA SAL Bueno . ( She gets up , putting her pipe in her pocket ) Oh , mira . Luna came by . She wanted me to give you these . ( She takes out a small bag of corn seeds from her pocket , hands them to Chac-Mool . ) CHAC-MOOL They 're from the garden ? MAMA SAL Uh-huh . She thought maybe you could throw a few of the seeds over there in Nuevo Mxico . See if they take root . CHAC-MOOL She see my mom ? MAMA SAL ( Nods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone ? MAMA SAL S. Go on in there now , talk to your mam . ( She kisses him on the cheek and starts to exit. ) p. 93 CHAC-MOOL You 're not coming ? MAMA SAL Hell no . Talking about my own damn burial , I 'm gointu go find me some beer . ( She exits . Chac-Mool crosses to the garden . He throws the seeds back into the cornfield . The lights fade. ) p. 94 Act 2 , Scene 8 Scene Eight Medea dumps the contents of Mama Sal 's satchel onto the kitchen table .

She crosses to a bottle of tequila . It is half empty . She takes a shot . Chac-Mool enters . MEDEA I tried getting her back . But I would n't beg . If you expected me to beg , I did n't . CHAC-MOOL I did n't expect nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MEDEA Then go pack your bags . CHAC-MOOL Mom . MEDEA You 've decided , have n't you ? You 've been approved . CHAC-MOOL Yes . MEDEA Then go pack your bags . CHAC-MOOL I do n't wan na leave you like this . MEDEA Now , that 's a line I 've heard before . But they leave you anyway , do n't they ? The line-givers . CHAC-MOOL It 's not a line . MEDEA They 're all lines , mijito . Rehearsed generations in advance and transmitted into your little male DNA . p. 95 CHAC-MOOL Why you turning on me , Mom ? MEDEA I think that 's the question I have to ask you . CHAC-MOOL What am I supposed to do ? Who am I supposed to be , Mom . There 's nobody to be . No man to be . MEDEA So all the tos I 've surrounded you with , are n't men . CHAC-MOOL That 's not what I mean . MEDEA Jotos are n't men . CHAC-MOOL They 're not my father . MEDEA You are not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . CHAC-MOOL And without a country ? You made me want it , Mom . More than anything . It was " our blood got spilled . Yaqui blood .

You chose for yourself , not for me ! MEDEA That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember . Where is she now ? ( After a beat , Medea crosses back to the table . Takes another shot of tequila , she keeps her back to him . ) That 's it ? You 're not gon na talk to me no more ? MEDEA You win . Vete . ( He does n't move . ) Go , Chac-Mool . ( He still does n't move . ) ( Turning to him ) What ? You want my blessing , too ? Qu dios te bendiga ! Lo siento mucho , hijo , pero no soy tu mamacita davidosa . ( Grabbing her breast ) The chichi has run dry . CHAC-MOOL ( After a beat ) You 're crazy . He 's right . He told me you were crazy . He met me at the border . He told me to come with him . Right then . p. 97 MEDEA You should have . CHAC-MOOL I did n't . I did n't because you taught me loyalty . Because I was n't going to sneak away from you like a punk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that door like a man . MEDEA A man . CHAC-MOOL Yeah , a man . Just the way you taught me . You fucked him , I did n't . You fucked yourself . ( Medea goes to slap Chac-Mool , then stops herself . He stares at her . A stoned silence , then he exits . Mama Sal stands at the doorway , the sack of beer in her hands . Medea slumps onto a chair at the kitchen table . She reaches again for the bag of herbs . ) MAMA SAL Qu ' sts haciendo ? ( She lets the herbs run through her fingers . ) MEDEA All the babies , they 're slipping through my fingers now . I ca n't stop them . They 've turned into the liquid of the river and they are drowning in my hands . MAMA SAL Medea MEDEA I lost her . I lost my baby . We were splintered , severed in two . I wanted a female to love , that 's all , Abuelita . Is that so much to want ? MAMA SAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herbs ) How much ? p. 98 MAMA SAL No , Medea . You do n't have to do this . MEDEA A stranger has inhabited me , taken possession of my body , disguised himself innocently in the sexless skin of my placenta . ( Extending the bag to her ) How much ? MAMA SAL Half of that . Es suficiente . ( Medea dumps the herbs into a pot as the lights cross-fade to Cihuatateo who enter as women warriors . They perform a stylized enactment of a traditonal midwife birthing . There is chanting in Nahuatl and deep moaning . Nurse stands between Medea 's legs awaiting the birth of the infant . As the infant emerges , we see that it is Luna , in the lifeless form of a woman . She is shapeless liquid . The others can not revive her . They all scatter , leave her abandoned onstage , except for Cihuatateo West , who , as the lights change , takes on the shape of Savannah . She draws a huge white sheet over Luna and herself . When the couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet . It is a kind of tableau of the Aztec codex , symbolizing marriage . The Guard enters and announces . PRISON GUARD " Blood Wedding . " LUNA Medea was pregnant within weeks and the matter of names came up again  --  what to call that he/she clinging fish-gilled and hermaphrodite inside her liquid belly . She loved her belly more than the man but was grateful to Jasn for that first effortless conception . He took her virginal and spineless . Except there was no blood , no stain upon the sheet . The blood was only under her tongue , I found . A small pool behind the bottom row of her teeth , a dam holding back the ruby kiss , the original name of which she once spilled into my mouth . I , who would never give her children . I , who would always make her sweat and bleed every month . Our shared moons , a marriage of the most bitter , sweet-lipped kind . p. 99 SAVANNAH Just keep talkin ' that talk , girl , and I 'll never leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet . Blackout. ) p. 100 Act 2 , Scene 9 Scene Nine As in the beginning of the play , the figure of Coatlicue is illuminated . Medea , wearing a long white nightgown , stands before the statute in prayer , holding a cup in her hand , then raising it in offering to the Diosa . MEDEA Coatlicue , this is my holy sacrifice . I would have preferred to die a warrior woman , like the Cihuatateowomen who die in childbirthoffering their own livesto the birthing of others . How much simpler things would have been.But what life do I have to offer to my son now ? He refuses my gifts and turns to my enemiesto make a man of him. I can not relinquish my son to them , to walk ese camino tristewhere they will call himby his manly nameand he goes deafto hear it . But the road I must walk is sadder still . ( Chac-Mool enters . Medea turns to him , a bit offguard . ) CHAC-MOOL I just came in to say good night . It 's a habit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAC-MOOL Yeah , it 's a long trip tomorrow . p. 101 MEDEA ( After a beat ) Forgive me , hijo . CHAC-MOOL Mom , I  --  MEDEA I know that 's stupid to say after so many words . Harsh words . But , if you let me , could I bless you now , before you go ? CHAC-MOOL Now ? MEDEA I got the copal burning . CHAC-MOOL Okay . ( He goes to her , opens his hands in front of her . She brings the smoking resin to him , wafts his body with it . ) MEDEA Our ancestors are watching , hijo . They pity us . They know what is in our hearts . CHAC-MOOL I 'm sorry . ( She prays over him softly , then returns the burning copal to her altar . ) MEDEA Can you stay up with your mami for a little while ? CHAC-MOOL I 'm tired , Mom . MEDEA I made you some atole . It may not be as good as Luna 's pero no quieres probarlo ? I made it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on your pijamas first . Yo te espero. p. 102 CHAC-MOOL Okay . ( Chac-Mool starts to exit , then suddenly turns and runs over to Medea . He throws his arms around her . Medea starts to pull him away and he clings all the tighter . ) I love you , Mom . MEDEA S , hijo . Ya lo s . Now , go get changed , then come outside.You can drink your atole out there . The moon is so clear . CHAC-MOOL Okay . ( Chac-Mool exits . Medea takes out a bag of herbs from her gown , sprinkles them into the atole . She addresses Coatlicue . ) MEDEA Can you smell it , Madre ? Mi hijo 's manhood . He wears it in his sleep now . In the morning I find it in a heap on the floor , crumpled in his pijamas . Like Luna , I bring the soft flannel to my nose . I inhale . No baby smell . No boy . A man moving inside his body . I felt a small rise against my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place that was once his home . Where is my baby 's sweet softness now ? ( Chac-Mool reenters , naked from the waist up and wearing pajama pants . Medea holds the cup of atole . ) CHAC-MOOL Mom ? MEDEA Vente , hijo . It 's too hot in here . Let 's go watch the corn grow . ( She grabs his hand and escorts him outside into the backyard , next to the field of corn . They sit down together . She puts her arms around him . ) El maz ' st muy alto . p. 103 CHAC-MOOL Yeah , too tall . I feel kind of bad I did n't harvest it . I forgot somehow . MEDEA You were thinking of other things . No te apures . In Aztln , there 's plenty to harvest . CHAC-MOOL Yeah . ( There is a pause . ) MEDEA Toma , hijo . This will help you sleep . ( He drinks . Beat . ) CHAC-MOOL Mom  --  MEDEA Do n't say anything more , hijo . No mas palabras . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , singing : ) Durmete mi nioDurmete mi solDurmete pedazode mi corazn . My sleeping little angel . ( He is instantly drowsy . She strokes his hair ) Sleep , mi diosito . Sleep the innocent sleep of the childless . ( He passes out . It is a piet image , Medea holding him limp within her arms . Then , with much effort , she tries to drag Chac-Mool 's body into the small field of corn . She is unable to . The Cihuatateo enter , dressed in the traditional Aztec . They lift Chac-Mool and take him into the center of the field . Meanwhile , Medea starts pulling up all the overgrown corn stalks in the field , piling them into a mound higher and higher . She becomes frenzied , a frightening image , her white nightgown flowing in the sudden wind . The pile of blue corn stalks have formed a kind of altar . The Cihuatateo heave Chac-Mool 's body on top of it . ) Hijo ! Mensajero ! How much simpler had you been born a daughterthat first female seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigil at the hour of my deathwashed my body with sweet soapanointing it with oil . You would have wrapped me in colored clothsworthy of the meeting of mothers.My finest feathers and skins would adorn meas you returned me to the earth . ( Calling out against the wind and to the illuminated figure of Coatlicue . ) What crime do I commit now , Mam ? To choose the daughter over the son ? You betrayed us , Madre Coatlicue.You , anciana , you who birthed the God of War . Huitzilopotchli.His Aztec name sours upon my lips.as the name of the sonof the woman who gave me birth . My mother did not stop my brother 's handfrom reaching into my virgin bed.Nor did you hold back the swordthat severed your daughter 's head . Coyolxauhqui , diosa de la luna .

The moon moves behind the mountains . The lights fade to black. ) @x Flauta and tambor . The Cihuatateo North and South appear upstage . They are positioned together in the statuesque pose of the original icons : kneeling , sitting on their heels , their hands pushed forward in a kind of martial arts stance . They begin to dance in slow ritualized movement . Lights rise on Luna who sits before a potter 's wheel . She leans into a mass of clay . Mama sal 's satchel sits at her feet . LUNA In her absence she is all the disguises she wore . She isthe flood of fever that fills my veinswith a woman 's passing perfume . She isla msica flamenca , the gypsy allure , the lie . She is the painting of a woman fractured and defiant.Cueva of clay opening como flor.Coyolxauhqui 's unnamed star sister . She is renegade rebozo , el tambor 's insistence , a warrior 's lament.Slender hips of silk.She is silk . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I could sing of her breasts with my hands . With my hands , I could singshe was a woman who never stopped being naked to me . ( Luna rises . The Prison Guard enters , helps Luna put on a suit jacket , hands her a bouquet of fresh white flowers and Mama Sal 's satchel . She escorts Luna to the psychiatric ward . The Prison Guard joins the Cihuatateo upstage . Medea waits on the edge of her bed. ) p. 106 Medea ? MEDEA You 've come back ? I thought you 'd never come back . LUNA I was stopped at the border .

Old and tired . MEDEA She should be less tired now . I was a burden to her . LUNA Yes . How are you ? MEDEA I 'm old and tired , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window ) LUNA I dreamed of you last night . MEDEA I thought so . LUNA In the image of a maguey exploding from a vagina . MEDEA More flowers ? LUNA No , desert cactus . There was nothing sweet about it . MEDEA ( After a pause , turning to her ) You know what I always loved about you , Luna ? LUNA No , what ? MEDEA Your innocence . LUNA I 'm innocent ? MEDEA Your hands . ( Medea goes to her , wraps her hands around Luna 's ) p. 107 Your hands have handled dozens of women and somehow they remain virgin hands . You left her , did n't you ? LUNA Who ? MEDEA The other woman . LUNA Yes . MEDEA Not me , I 'm not innocent . I am spoiled . What I touch is spoiled and I am spoiled by the touches of others . LUNA Did I spoil you , Medea ?

( She opens Mama Sal 's bag and pulls out a small bundle. ) p. 108 MEDEA You have Mama 's bag . LUNA Toma . ( Luna gives Medea the bundle . Medea unwraps it , stares at it , awed . ) It 's a Cihuatateo . MEDEA ( Suddenly urgent , she grabs Luna ) Is that how I died , Luna ? Giving birth to myself ? LUNA I  --  MEDEA Is that what you came to tell me ? LUNA I do n't know . ( Nurse enters . Medea and Luna 's eyes are locked onto each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some water , negrita ? LUNA What ?

( Beat. ) p. 109 LUNA Good-bye , Medea . ( Luna leaves . Medea holds the Cihuatateo figure in her hands . She looks upstage to the Coro . ) CIHUATATEO AND MEDEA And though banished from AztlnMedea and Luna kept the faith , fasted by the phases of the moonbut did not pierce their fleshfor they bled regularly between their legsand did not die .

You 're the son I mourn , the one I pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the other side . CHAC-MOOL It 's me . MEDEA Daily , I try to join him and my hands are always emptied of the instruments of death . They steal my fingernail file and panty hose and yerbas . They give me no yerbas here , just pathetic pastel pills that numb me , but wo n't kill me . They 're useless . CHAC-MOOL Mother . MEDEA Mother . I had a mother once , for a moment . Do you have a mother ? CHAC-MOOL Yes . MEDEA Is she beautiful ? I imagine she 's beautiful . You are beautiful , or maybe you are the image of your father . CHAC-MOOL She 's beautiful . MEDEA That 's nice how you talk about her . I 'd like to meet her .
