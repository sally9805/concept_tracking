Prologue The Campaign April , the year 2000 ONE At eight in the morning of his last day in Boston , Sean Burke paced out tight circles on the corner of Kenmore Square , waiting for the abortionist , a nine-millimeter semiautomatic handgun hidden in the inside pocket of his army jacket . Sean knew his enemy from the demonstrations  --  a slight man with brown wisps of hair and hollow cheekbones , gray soulless eyes that ignored the pickets even when they cried out , " Do n't kill me , Mommy and Daddy , " in the imagined voice of a fetus . Part of Sean prayed for him to come ; that other part , frightened and irresolute , hoped he would not . He encouraged himself by imagining the faces of the children he would save . He passed forty minutes this way . With each moment , Sean felt more anxious . And then the man was there , emerging from the subway . The abortionist 's hands were in his coat pockets . His eyes focused on the sidewalk , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright April day . He did not notice Sean . Sean swallowed . His throat was dry , his mouth sour , the pit of his stomach clenched and raw . Clumsily , he reached a gloved hand into his left pocket and popped the last antacid pill into his mouth , teeth grinding it to chalk . Dr. Bowe disappeared inside the building . It was an old brownstone hotel , converted to offices for doctors , dentists , milliners , discount jewelers ; passing through the double glass doors , a pregnant woman could be shopping for a necklace , not seeking an accomplice to help murder her unborn child . Sean knew only that the offices were on the first floor : because of a court order , pickets were required to stay outside and keep the walkway clear . The red carpet , their leader , Paul Terris , had named it . But neither Paul 's exhortations nor all their protests had stopped the flow of blood . Yet Sean stood there , still afraid . The chalk in his mouth tasted bitter . If Sean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind : the comfort of the church where he served as caretaker ; the room above the parish offices , his home for three years now ; the compassion of Father Brian Shaw , who praised his work and worried , in his soft-voiced way , about Sean 's " intensity . " In the newspapers and on television , in the streets and the bars of Charlestown , they would call Sean a murderer . Let God be his judge , then . God and the children . But Sean stood frozen , a slender man , with lank black hair and pale-blue eyes . Alone , as he had felt almost all his life , Sean watched the random pageant of the city pass him by : tardy workers rushing from the subway ; cars honking ; students heading for Boston University ; an Asian nanny with a plaid wool scarf at her throat , pushing a baby in a blue carriage . They did not notice him and would not have understood had they known . Then he saw her  --  a young woman in a wool coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her face more Irish than Sean 's own . He could imagine her sitting next to him in school . Pausing on the sidewalk , she gazed at the double glass doors beneath the letters that spelled " Kenmore Building . " Sean could feel her reluctance as intensely as he felt his own . She was there for the abortionist , Sean was certain . Her back to Sean , she seemed barely to move . In his mind they were coupled : if she did not enter , perhaps Sean would grant the clinic a reprieve . Just for today . Please , he murmured , save your baby . He prayed she was not one of them . With a shrug , so small that Sean perhaps imagined it , the young woman walked toward the door . Sean felt the anger come . If she was not worthy of the life she bore , then he must be . Oblivious to traffic , Sean crossed the street . As he touched it , the gun in his pocket reassured him . On the Saturday before last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon at a package store : the same model , the owner informed him , that the Turkish guy had used to shoot the Pope  --  small , light , easy to conceal . Sean stifled his dislike . " God bless the Holy Father , " he said simply . In the woods nearby , Sean had practiced . Aiming the gun , he had imagined looking into his victim 's face , blocking out all doubt , all fears . His aim had been good -- first trees , then rocks , then a careless squirrel which had almost vanished in a single shot . But now Sean 's hand shook . He was five feet from the door , then four feet . Each step felt leaden . He must remember the lessons of history , Sean told himself . If he could have murdered Hitler , the Nazis would have called him a criminal , reviled the name Sean Burke . Perhaps Gring and the others would have hung him on a meat hook . And , perhaps , millions of others would have lived  --  Jews and Slavs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sean paused in front of the door , taking a last deep breath of morning air . He walked into the dim hallway , looking to both sides . He saw a travel agency , an accountant 's office . And then he found it . A green laminate door with metal letters : " The Boston Women 's Clinic . " Since the demonstrations had failed , the abortionists in their arrogance no longer had a guard there . Sean took the wool cap from his inside pocket and pulled it over his head . For a last moment , his left hand rested on the doorknob . He made himself imagine the red-haired girl , nervously waiting for the abortionist to put a plastic tube between her legs and suck the life from her womb . Sean murmured a final prayer and opened the door . The girl was there . She gazed up at him from behind her magazine , as if surprised . With her cap off , her hair was a riot of red curls . " Yes ? " the receptionist asked . Sean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightening black and lipstick as red as blood . Softly , he said , " I 'm here for Dr. Bowe . " The skin of her face was pale as parchment . She stared up at him from her swivel chair , still but for her left hand . There was a panic button beneath her desk , someone had told him ; the day the others had occupied the waiting room , she had used it to call security . " Do n't . " Sean 's voice was harsh now . The red-haired girl dropped her magazine . The receptionist 's throat moved in a convulsive swallow , choking her words . " What do you want ? " Sean took out his gun . " To stop you , " he answered , and pulled the trigger . It was a kind of magic . As her head snapped back , a hole opened in her forehead . There was a soft concussive sound , like a melon hitting cement , almost lost in the red-haired girl 's cry . Sean stared in stupefaction as the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead . Only when she hit the carpet did Sean turn to the girl . " Do n't move . " His voice came out panicky , too high . Gun in hand , he stumbled down the hallway . The abortionist was in the room where he did his work , bent over a metal cabinet in the corner . Sean stared at him , then at the table covered in white paper , the altar where women sacrificed the innocent . His hand trembled as he raised the gun . Dr. Bowe barely had time to peer sideways before Sean shot at his temple . The red stain appeared . Sean watched in near astonishment as the abortionist fell to his knees , face pitching forward into the files of his victims . Only then did Sean register the melon sound again . With a rush of anger , Sean lifted Bowe 's warm twitching body and threw him onto the table , wrenching his legs open in the spraddle of all the women whose children he had murdered . The abortionist 's eyes were glazed , his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gasp behind him . A nurse stood in the door , a stethoscope around her neck , mouth forming words that would not come . Sean did not want to kill her ; she was a tool , like the receptionist . But he had no choice . " I 'm sorry , " he murmured , and shot her in the chest . The nurse crumpled in the doorway , then was still . Sean stepped across her body , looking down at her . At least her family , if she had one , could gaze into her face without flinching . Sean walked down the hallway in a trance . The red-haired young woman shivered on the couch , staring at the dead receptionist , too frightened to move . Tears streamed down her face . Sean could not bring himself to kill the life inside her . Sean knelt in front of her , giving comfort , seeking it . " I had to stop him . Your sympathy should be with your baby , the life I came to save . " Comprehension filled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stammered . Sean felt the blood rush to his face . He stood , humiliated and confused , blood pounding like a trip-hammer in his temples . His finger squeezed the trigger . " Please . I only came here for an IUD . . . " Sean dropped his gun and ran from the building . There was a subway station at the corner . Sean rushed down the stairs and through the turnstile . Some vestige of discipline made him find the men 's room , leave his jacket , gloves , and wool cap in a stall , and walk to the platform with a numb unhurried stride , a young man in a Holy Cross sweatshirt . Take the green line to Court Street , then transfer to blue . He recited this like a rosary as the subway stopped and he boarded the half-empty car . No one looked at him . She was lying . Sean had saved her baby , and she had lied to save herself , believing he would think it less damning to thwart life with a piece of plastic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined the sirens screaming as the cars arrived at Kenmore Square . At Court Street , the subway doors hissed open . Arms folded , head bowed , Sean walked out and waited in the dingy tunnel , a portrait of urban anonymity . He had asked Father Brian if he could take a week 's vacation in New Hampshire . " Surely , " the priest had answered in his mild way , " but is early April a good time ? The mud season , they call it in New England . " Within minutes , the subway for Logan Airport came . Sean 's suitcase was in a locker at the airport . He pulled it out . If his plan worked , the last trace of him found in Boston would be the jacket , the hat , the gloves . Remorse mingled with relief now at the lifting of his burden : he no longer stood watch , armed only with signs and slogans , while children died . Face pinched , he went through security at Gateway C. No one stopped him . He headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by vacationers , students on spring break , commercial travelers leaving their homes . But the only person in line was a black woman with glasses and a briefcase . Uncomfortable , Sean hung back until she was finished . The blond ticket agent raised her eyebrows . " Next ? " There was a hint of challenge , Sean thought . This might be the end : the red-haired woman could describe him , and he was certain that the police kept files on Operation Life . " Next ? " she repeated , impatient now , studying his face . Sean pulled the ticket from his back pocket and placed it on the counter . She flipped it open . " Mr. Burke , " she said . " Photo ID , please . " Sean took out his wallet . To his own eyes , the photo on his driver 's license looked furtive . For a long moment , the ticket agent looked from Sean to his photo and back again . One call , he thought . The airport swarmed with cops and blue-uniformed security officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your luggage yourself ? " she asked . " Yes . " " One bag ? " " Yes . " " Did someone you did not know give you anything to carry ? " Sean drew a breath . " I would n't do that , " he said . The ticket agent hesitated , watching him . " Zone C , " she told him . " Seat twenty-five B. They board about one-fifteen . " Once on the plane , Sean realized , he would be trapped . He did not board until the final call . At two o'clock , the plane had not taken off . A mechanical problem , the pilot explained in his John Wayne voice  --  a systems light that wo n't come on , probably just an electrical short . Sit tight and I 'll keep you posted . Sean bowed his head . They were holding him , Sean thought . At any moment , they would evacuate the plane and clap handcuffs on his wrists . The feeling came to him again : he was a small and lonely boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's blank indifference . There was no safe place for him . Sean stood abruptly . He reeled to the rear bathroom , past the other passengers , their faces weary , trapped , indifferent . His own face in the mirror was white . When the retching started , racking his body , all he saw in the basin was saliva and traces of blood . The bathroom felt like a closet . Sean opened the door , gulping for breath . Slowly , he returned to his seat . He kept his eyes averted from the woman sitting next to him . Ten minutes later , the pilot made his final announcement . Then the plane lifted into the air , vibrating with power , and Sean Burke left Boston forever .
