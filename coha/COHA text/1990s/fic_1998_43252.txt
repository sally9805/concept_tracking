I was living in San Francisco 's Mission District , at Valencia and lI i4th , across the street from some projects and a Gold 's Gym and above the Lady Luck Candle Shop . On the corner was a dusty convenience store run by two Lebanese brothers . You could get loose cigarettes there for a nickel . Up 14th Street , half a block , was Kate 's place . <p> She had a fairly big studio , nicer than mine , on the second floor of a clean white building . There was no furniture except for a folding table with a typewriter by the kitchen , two lamps , and an end table , a futon in the big walk-in closet , beneath a small window , and various books and chunks of candle . There was nothing at all in the main room . The drapes were large swatches of burgundy cloth , tied open most of the time ; light from the streetlamps poured into the apartment and turned it a kind of dark amber . We could see into the places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true for hers , but only the main room was really visible . I would wait on the futon when she went to the bathroom , and she would hurry back along the wall , as if the shadows were deeper there , one arm folded across her breasts . <p> Kate worked half days as an assistant at a Montessori school on Dolores , a couple of blocks away . I would walk her there in the mornings , before the fog burned off , and she would pull me into doorways and kiss me , and we would say ridiculous , sweet things . I would walk down to i6th Street and get coffee and write her long , rambling notes which I would leave under her door ( we did not exchange keys ) before heading off to practice or to my job . <p> I was waiting tables in Hayes Valley four days a week at a place , several years gone now , called Way Out West that served American cuisine : basic farm breakfasts with a little unconvincing vegetarian fare-garden burgers , three-bean chili @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mix . Though the crowd , especially on weekends , was made up mostly of artistic types , bikers and skate kids who coasted down from the Lower Haight and Western Addition , the owner , Mr. Bong , routinely fired waiters and waitresses for getting their noses pierced or dyeing their hair . In many ways , he behaved like a man who woke up one day and suddenly found himself in charge of a faltering restaurant with unreadable menus . He was always shouting in Korean at his half-brother ( whom we referred to as Baby Bong ) and drawing up battle plans to improve business , the first step of which often involved getting physical with the bums who propped themselves up against the wall outside the restaurant . He would give a broad you-can't-fool-me smile to certain hippies and blacks who came in for lunch before bluntly asking them , " You got money ? " He distrusted me , too , because I had an earring , and , after almost a year , he would still get on my case from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came back after a cigarette break to find him clearing one of my two-tops . " You not professional . " But I was making at least forty dollars a shift ; and if I did my side-work as I went , I could always cash out by nine , and that was key because of the band . <p> I played bass in a power trio along with my friends Blue and Jack . Things were starting to happen for us . We were headlining all over town , and we 'd made our own record : BAM had liked it , the Guardian had liked it , and Michael , our manager , was sure it would get distributed . <p> We took a fairly straight-forward approach : power chords , big initial hits , lots of fuzzy harmonics developing in a wide way . I wrote some of the songs , but most of them were Blue 's , and his tendency was always toward two- or three-chord , overdriven , crunchy punk riffs . The structure was sometimes so simple that calling it verse-chorus-verse would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by verse slow-andsoft ) . But Blue had a knack for coming up with interesting melodies , and his voice was a beautiful sound , careening and confident ; he could wrap a dozen notes around a single chord . The simple progressions gave me a lot of freedom , and my bass lines had gotten way more complex . I had a zoo-watt Ampeg head , a matching cabinet with four 12 's , and I played a black Fender Pbass . I 'd have my hands all over the frets , playing eight notes to every two coming off Blue 's guitar , doing descending fills , arpeggios . In a lot of ways Blue 's voice was the most dynamic element in our sound , and whenever possible I followed it . Onstage , under that real high sound-pressure for which there is just no substitute , with all the secondary reverb scrabbling across the floors and up the walls , you would get this weirdly delicate counterpoint ; this pretty , bridgeless thing . <p> We 'd gone on some short tours : down to Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene , Portland , and Seattle . I was never crazy about those tours : you 're driving so many miles . . . and when you finally do reach the city , you 're tired and disoriented , your hands smell like gasoline and ketchup , you 're just a few more goofs out walking in the rain . We trudged our equipment from the van into clubs , past kids our own age in whose faces I saw the arrogance I myself could work up for bands I did n't know . What was unnerving was that you noticed it : you only did when you were down . And you never mentioned it to each other ; you said things like " Let 's kick some ass . " <p> I 'd met Kate during the winter at a party . She was living with a guy in another band , a drummer named Neil . For a short time , Neil 's band had shared our rehearsal space in the Lower Haight . They were an acoustic-electric blend , sort of art-poppy and moody : no real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said listening to them practice was like looking at a lava lamp ) ; and they would do things like hand out fliers at their shows quoting Borges and Nietzsche ; but we liked them , had recently played with them . Neil was a good drummer and a kind of big , smart , quiet guy . Neil and Kate had gone to school together in Michigan . She was a writer . She 'd written a novel that was going to be published , and with the advance they had come to California in the fall . She was n't sure if she liked San Francisco yet , she told me . Her father lived in Long Island ; she had thought about moving to New York instead . <p> At the party she seemed to run into me quite a bit . While we were both waiting for the bathroom , I was in the middle of saying something to her when she cut me off . " Your eyes are like little Earths , " she said . " Little planets . " <p> I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we laughed . <p> I knew Blue had met Kate previously . When I mentioned her , he said , " I do n't like that girl . She 's a bitch . " " What 's wrong with her ? " <p> " She 's so proud of herself . She wrote a novel . Big fucking deal . " <p> About a month later , I ran into Kate at a cafe on Mission Street . She was reading a book I 'd never heard of ; she told me about it and had me read a paragraph : it was some novel about God and horse thieves . She and Neil were living near Alamo Square at the time , but that night he was playing a private party at the Crystal Pistol , a few blocks from the cafe , and she planned to head over there later . I asked her if she wanted to get a beer , and we went down the street to Uptown , somewhere I liked to go after gigs and rehearsal because it was mellow and you could sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour or so . <p> Kate was tall and thin , and her long neck seemed to hold her head in a dangerous balance high up over her shoulders , like a marionette 's . She had thick brown hair , cut straight across , and a stunningly beautiful face that was nevertheless drawn , and very pale , and intense . She laughed easily and seemed very sure of herself : she would look right at you when she talked . <p> She acted like she knew me well . At the bar she told me that she wanted to be famous . <p> When I laughed , she said , " People do n't like to talk about that , I know . " <p> I said , " Yeah , well . It 's not exactly my favorite sport , either . " <p> She seemed a little embarrassed , and we moved on to another topic , but it was n't that I thought she 'd said a horrible thing . I just did n't know what you could really say . <p> We left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The blocks near Mission were always bleak and poorly lit , uriney , strewn with garbage . It was cold and windy . Kate wore a thin leather jacket over a light green cardigan-a wino sweater , she called it . The jacket did n't sit right on the sweater , and her jeans were loose : I could n't tell exactly where her body was inside her clothes . She had a graceful , determined , somehow unathletic way of walking . As we stood at the crosswalk on Mission and 17th , she said , " So , Dean , does this go on a lot , or . . ? " <p> " Does what ? " <p> " I do n't know . . . rocker boy , knocking around , Wan na grab a beer with me ? ' sort of thing . " She was smiling . " Is n't that . . pretty much . . . ? " " Oh , that . " <p> " I mean , I like it- " She touched my arm and pointed almost straight up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There were a lot of cars on Mission , and people hanging out on the sidewalk near the porn store and donut shop . Across 17th , some were already curled up with blankets and cardboard in the darkened storefront of an old retail warehouse with empty upper floors . The sign Kate was talking about was on its roof : a gigantic frame without lights , and empty except for enormous old letters in stark relief , like cutouts , against the sky . " 17 Reasons Why ! " That 's all it said . In daylight you could see it from blocks away , looming like a marquee for an outdoor theater . <p> It was a cool sign , but at the moment I was thinking of other things . I said , " Kate , you 're giving me a hard time . What 's up with that ? " <p> I took her arm and turned her around to face me , and I kissed her she leaned back against a dark store window , and we went at it . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from her , down at the ground , and my hair dropped over my eyes . I let it hang there . My heart was pounding . I could see her right foot propped against the glass , and she was swinging her knee very slowly , bumping it against the outside of my leg . Two of her fingers were hooked into the cuff of my jacket . She said , " Well , then . " When I looked up , she was staring at me-an impatient , solemn expression that surprised me . But she was trembling , and she stayed where she was , and I started kissing her again . <p> Sometimes , during the murky six weeks that followed , Neil would answer the phone when I called for Kate , and we 'd shoot the breeze for a minute or so ; eventually I 'd ask if Kate was there , and he 'd say , " Yeah , sure , hang on , " and that was that . Not that I thought he was actually happy to hear my voice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , and I was sure he knew it had something to do with me . <p> But I was n't pressing Kate for details of their home life . I was running between pay phones in Hayes Valley after work trying to reach her ; I was waiting on her for half an hour by the canned cat food in the back of a corner store on a rainy night and kissing her goodbye behind the big tree in Alamo Square Park at three in the morning . For me , the thing was so intense and was happening so rapidly-she called it " our collision " - that it was easy , when I thought about it at all , to see in Neil 's laid-back attitude a cool acceptance of the facts . It seemed possible that everyone involved would emerge safely on the other side , away from the wreck . <p> By March , Kate had left Neil and moved in down the block from me . Now if I happened to see Neil , walking down the street , he would ignore me . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly and he just kept going . He was growing a beard . <p> That first time , I was truly caught off-guard when he did n't say hello , and I felt like an ass . It was as if , strolling past , he 'd held out his share of our phony phone conversations and by reflex I 'd taken them off his hands . <p> Kate met Neil for coffee several times that first month , and they talked on the phone quite a bit . If she was on the phone when I came over and mouthed that it was Neil , I would hold up my middle finger and she would smile-but she would n't just hang up ; she would n't say , " Neil , I have to go , Dean is here . " And if I spoke out loud , she instantly looked furious . " Have a heart , " she would say , when she finally did get off the line . " Jesus . " Sometimes I apologized : I knew she felt guilty for leaving Neil ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't there . Late one night , not long after the move , we were lying in bed when her doorbell rang , and she jumped up in alarm : she thought Neil was down at the gate with a box of her things . " So go down and get him , " I said , sitting up . " I 'll pick up some of these condom wrappers . " <p> She said , " That 's not funny , Dean . Please . You 've got to-would you just get dressed and , just for one minute , go out and stand on the courtyard stairs ? " The buzzer rang again . " Please ! " I pulled on my clothes , stepped out into the hallway , and found a door leading to a rickety inner staircase that had a kind of Rear Window view of several lit-up , empty-looking apartments . I heard Kate run past the door and down the main stairs towards the front gate . I lit a cigarette and stared straight up at the pale misty sky . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage out to the street , and went home . <p> The phone was ringing when I got in . It was Kate , of course , and we got into a fight . I hung up on her . But eventually we wound up at my place . <p> We argued then about a lot of things . Kate said , " It sounds like you just want a normal girlfriend , " and I said , " You 're so full of shit . I just want to know what the deal is . Do you want to be with me or not ? " She said she was in love with me . <p> Kate would say things like " I think you 're infinite . " She would say , " You 're like a church . " She would bring me old records and picture books from the Purple Heart thrift store near our block or a bag of my favorite granola from the Rainbow Grocery . She would stand in the alley behind my place and shout , " Throw down the keys , Dino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me how much she loved me , and she would cry about things that had happened to her , and I would sing her to sleep with old Elvis Costello songs-she always wanted to hear the same ones-and then I would lie awake wondering what would happen to us . <p> Kate was always talking about New York and about famous writers she had met when she went to New York , and she would get letters from these guys in the mail and moan and groan about what slimeballs they were . She even asked me once if she thought she should open a particular envelope , and I said , " I think it 's a bad idea ; let me , " and I grabbed it from her and held it out of her reach , and we laughed , and she wound up tearing the thing to pieces and throwing it in the trash . She carried a thin spiral notebook everywhere , a kind of diary , she said , and was always writing things down : she would just pop out with it when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know half the things she mentioned-books and styles and whatever . And she would sometimes say things about Neil-that he did n't know much about Peru or something-that were about ten times more true for me . I would say so . She would say , " But you know other things , " and I would say , " No , I do n't , Kate . I really do n't . " She 'd say she liked the lyrics to our songs . <p> On my twenty-fourth birthday , in mid-June , we walked up to the Haight for dinner and then saw a movie , Picnic at Hanging Rock , at the Red Vic . It was a foggy night : as we were heading back down the hill we could n't even see the Bay . Beneath the fog , down in the Lower Haight , a single bus was climbing the hill toward us in perfect clarity . Kate said , " This city is so creepy at night . One night it 's like The Jetsons , you can see a hundred miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it 's like The Wild , Wild West . You know what I mean ? They 're like facades , " she said , pointing to some Victorians we were passing , flat and square beneath the white sky . " It 's like there 's nothing up there . No space , no heaven . There 's you , and me , and that 's it . " <p> I wanted it to be like that . I did n't want to think about anything else : not the band or her book , not our short-term leases , not anything . <p> For a while now , two songs from our record had been in heavy rotation on commercial stations in Silicon Valley and in the city , but sometimes , recently , when I heard them come on , I would turn off the sound . Kate would come out of the kitchen singing them , teasing me , and I would tell her to stop . She said she was proud of me ; she said , " I think you 're going to be great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year ago , we were sending out our first tapes to college radio stations ( cupped between stapled paper plates , which we autographed as a joke ) . It felt almost like bad luck that our songs were suddenly getting such airplay when nothing about the future-would the record get distributed ? would we get a contract ? - was certain . <p> I wanted to stay in bed with Kate . Nothing seemed more important to her , either , and we made love all the time . She would crawl on top of me , and every ounce of her body would fall into place , moving , and her whole neck and chest would get splotchy and red , and her nose would run , and her nails would cut into my hands-they would cut through my skin . <p> When her eyes were shut that tight , squeezing tears , and when I tried to imagine what she was seeing , it was always precisely that room , hers or mine , and the shape of our bodies , and it would make me almost sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over after work at the school and told me that she was going to her father 's house in Sag Harbor for the month of September . She 'd been talking about the idea for a while , but now she had a ticket . <p> She was going to have the book done by then and really wanted to take a break . I had told her , previously , that I did n't understand why we could n't just rent a car and go to Carmel or something . But Kate was as broke as I was-soon she 'd be waiting for her check from the publisher-and her father was paying for the trip . <p> When she returned in October , she was going to stay with me for a while , or we were going to get a place together . <p> She cried a little now when she talked about giving up her apartment . When it had come up in the past , Kate was the one who had acted The week before , for instance , she had gotten tears in her eyes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his girlfriend , Stacey , who worked in a clothing store near there . Kate had suddenly said she did n't feel well , and I walked her outside . She told me she could n't relax because she was thinking about her book , and then she started sobbing . " Do you want me to walk you home ? " She said she did n't . She said , " I 'm sorry . I 'm just having a hard time . " I could n't help feeling that she simply did n't want to be there with us . <p> Now I said , " Is something else going on , Kate ? " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " <p> " You tell me , Kate . I really do n't know . " When she did n't say anything right away , I said , " Did you buy a round-trip ticket ? " " It 's round-trip , it 's round-trip . October 3rd . " She looked down and shook her head . " That was a mean thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we made love . <p> Later in the afternoon , she read me a chapter of the novel . The Murphy bed was still down , but now we were on the couch , mostly dressed . It was hot , the windows were open , and the shades were drawn over the gaps ; they blew and bumped in the weak breeze . When she finished , we talked about the book . She said , " I do n't even care , at this point . I 'm like , get it away from me , you know ? " <p> " I know . " <p> She laughed . " Dean 's thinking , Mail it , mail it ! " She moved closer to me on the couch . She pressed her forehead against mine and then scraped around to the side of my head and kissed me . <p> We were quiet for a couple of minutes , and I closed my eyes . Then Kate said , " The kids are so funny when I read to them . " I lifted my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll point at the pictures and they 'll go , I 'd like to be that soldier , ' or , you know , I 'd like to be that rabbit . ' The little ones do n't get it , and they say , ' I want to be that stone . " ' <p> We both laughed . My favorite kid at the school , Joshua , had been a heroin addict the first month of his life . Once , when I 'd been there helping Kate , he 'd stared at the mirror in the back hall and said , " The boy in the mirror looks like Joshua , but he 's not Joshua . " When I 'd told Kate , she 'd said , " He always says that ! " She 'd been busy getting one of the girl 's shoes knotted up for the park . " And I always wonder , What 's he know that I do n't know ? " ' She 'd made a funny , puzzled face . " But I kind of know what he means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying on the couch when Blue showed up . <p> Blue belonged to the gym across from my building , and he used to come by nearly every day after working out , and we 'd have a beer and go over some songs or watch MTV . He came by less often now that Kate was around-once or twice a week . <p> He kept going in and out of the kitchen as I tried to talk to him . He would n't sit down . He lifted the shade from the kitchen window and looked out for a second then let it flop back down . I said , " Blue , man , trust me . The place is surrounded . Take a fucking seat . " <p> We all laughed . <p> Blue looked bad . I knew that he was feeling the same sort of anxiety I was-probably worse . He was always hungover , and he looked washed out . His skin looked pasty . His hair seemed thin . <p> This was relative , of course , because Blue was a very good-looking guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a thin , muscular body . He usually wore black Converse All-Stars and various T-shirts with the sleeves ripped off . Onstage , when he would switch from lead to rhythm on the guitar-when he came down hard on a chord after a pause-you felt like he could break the thing in two . <p> I sometimes thought Kate would have gone for Blue if he had n't been so cold to her from the start . I knew she was attracted to him , in a way . She would say things like " Nice house , but nobody 's home . " For quite a while she had seemed afraid of him , but now they were more or less used to each other . When she came out with us after gigs , they would joke around like anybody else ; she 'd even gone with him to see X down at the Shoreline Amphitheater one night when I had to work . When we were alone she would still mock his affectations : the way he squeezed his forehead when he sang and so forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen table and started juggling . <p> Kate said , " You 're so good at that ! " <p> Blue stopped immediately . <p> " No , keep going , " she said . <p> " He 's very good , " I said . He could juggle five balls with ease . <p> " Have you talked to Michael ? " Blue said . " The guy from Island is going to be there beforehand so we should try to be there by ten . " <p> " He left a message . " <p> " Where did you learn to juggle like that ? " Kate asked . " Santa Cruz . " <p> He set the oranges back on the table . <p> " Well , " she said , " if you guys ever do n't make it big , you can always join the circus . " <p> Blue said nothing . <p> Kate said , " You know what I mean , Blue . You know I 'm joking . " " Whatever , Kate : ' <p> " Do n't be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trying to be nice . " <p> Our gig that night was at Monkey Sea , south of Market , somewhere we 'd played half a dozen times , a place we liked . It was in a former meat locker on the second floor of an old warehouse , and there were numerous strings of monkey-face Christmas tree lights from Chinatown crisscrossing the ceiling and knotted around the beams . The bartenders brought booze up from the first floor in a hollow elevator shaft using a pulley system . <p> Blue and Jack and I had been living in the city for almost two years now and performing in it for longer than that . The whole scene was essentially familiar , and that familiarity was nice . You were n't jarred by whatever variety of weirdness you happened to come across : people fucking in the instant photo booth , or whatever . You were trying to grab the owner to give her your keys so the van would n't get towed ; you were trying to remember people 's names . It was like going to parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of town . <p> Blue was drunk as hell . He was getting into rave-ups that went on about twice as long as the songs were supposed to be . Sometimes we would just jam endlessly in A : he 'd keep building it up , drowning the dynamics . I 'd start holding the notes , looking at Jack ; we 'd practically have to trick Blue into bringing it back to the head . But all in all , it was a good set . No real hitches . Kate had stayed in to work . She 'd asked if I would put her down on the list in case she caught a cab at the last minute . Sometimes I 'd look up and see her there , bobbing around , holding a beer . She did n't make it tonight , and I was disappointed . <p> Blue , Jack , and I went to Uptown . <p> There were maybe a dozen people sitting on stools at the bar , mostly older guys , and some girls in the back room playing pool . Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'd noticed Neil as soon as we came through the door . He was in the front room , off to the side , sitting with four or five others on a couple of old couches there , beneath a large , flat-looking painting of a black dog bleeding in the snow . At the bar , Blue said , " Guess who . " " I saw him . " <p> " Look again . " <p> " What ? " <p> " The brunette . " <p> I had a moment 's queasy rush , but it was n't Kate . It was Kary Mead . <p> Kary Mead was a legend . Twelve years back , when she was about eighteen , she 'd fronted a great San Francisco band , The Cadets-without a doubt one of the best punk bands in the country . They 'd opened for The Clash at The Warfield in 1982 and , it is said , blew their cockney asses off the stage .

Every so often I 'd see her out in public . Once , she was at the library , looking at microfilm , and I 'd stood off to the side watching her . When I told the story later , Jack said she was probably looking up old reviews . <p> I said , " Let me just say what a surprise it is to have Neil and Kary Mead in the same line of vision . " <p> " No shit , " Blue said . He grabbed his beer and headed over . <p> In a few seconds , you could see Blue in his black leather jacket , standing in front of Neil . Neil leaned way back on the couch , looking surprised-even though I knew he 'd seen us come in . As far as I knew , the two of them had remained on good terms . <p> Jack watched for a second and then turned around to face the bar and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . The bar itself had only one rail , but a big rectangle had been cut into the wall behind it so the people playing pool and pinball in back could order drinks more easily . The jukebox was playing some country/lounge tune , a kind of sweet faux-swing that was a little like Patsy Cline before she 'd started making pop songs . <p> I looked at the girls again . They wore jeans and long shirts and a lot of loose , shiny bracelets , and they looked sexy and good in a frumpy way , but I said , " I 'm not up for it , man . I 'm tired . " I turned back to Blue . " I want to see what this is about . " <p> Jack glanced over at the couches . " Fuck Kary Mead , " he said , but not angrily . He was in a good mood . <p> Blue stood drinking his beer , talking to Neil , who did n't seem to be saying much . None of the others were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for Blue to wander away . <p> Jack watched pool . When I turned to grab my beer , he said , " Where 's Kate tonight ?

But it was after one , and I was sure she would n't want to come meet us with Neil there . I considered calling her , anyway . The pay phone was visible by the bathrooms , and Neil would know I was calling Kate . <p> Jack said , " Let 's shoot one game of pool . " <p> I sipped my beer . " In a minute , " I said . <p> I saw that Kary Mead was talking , and I got up and headed toward the couches . As I approached , I heard her say to Blue , " You 're a true jackass . " <p> Blue ignored her . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epic he 'd talked to the other day . <p> He was too drunk to be subtle .

I almost apologized for him . He was drunker than I thought . But it was also clear that these people were assholes . They all knew who Blue was and were doing what they could to make him feel like a zero . <p> " Blue , I want to hit the road soon . <p> " Why , man ? I think you know everybody here . Josie and the Pussies . Neil 's Danish . " <p> Neil 's Danish was a bakery near his place . " Blue . " <p> " Fuck you .

" That 's cool , " I said . <p> Blue was gazing off toward the back room . Kary Mead was looking down at her boots . It seemed to me so obvious that she was jealous of Blue . That was all Blue wanted to see , and he could n't . <p> I said , " We 'd love to stay and party with you folks all night . " I had my hand on Blue 's shoulder , edging him toward the bar .

" Shut the fuck up . " <p> " All three of us can talk about her , " he said . <p> At first this hardly registered . It was obvious that at this point Blue would say whatever ugly thing he could think of . <p> Kary Mead looked up at him and said , " Blue . . . or whatever . Just go . Everybody wants you to leave . You want to leave . So just leave . " <p> She got up and walked past us into the bathroom . <p> I looked at Blue , and I smiled , as if we shared some amused perspective on all this , as if we were a band and this shit happens . I clapped his shoulder again , and then I , too , walked away , into the back room . Whatever his remark about Kate really meant , I wanted to look like I 'd heard it before . I spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls , and I said a few casual , random things to Blue whenever he hovered near Jack 's chair between games of pinball . <p> On the ride home , with Jack behind the wheel chatting away and Blue in the backseat brooding , I started to get swamped by confused thoughts . It was easy to come up with half a dozen times when Blue and Kate could have gotten together , but the scenarios were vague enough that I was n't terribly pained by them . I kept thinking of Kate 's trip to Long Island . It seemed quite possible that Kate and I were through . I told myself I 'd been expecting it . At the same time , I did n't really believe that it was over . <p> In any case , I was feeling something other than anger . I remember clearly how , when Jack turned onto my street and drove past the projects , my block looked the way that it had in the old days , before Kate moved in . <p> I 'd left open a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't dislodged all the day 's heat , and I sat on the carpet by the window smoking a lemon-flavored cigarette , all they 'd had in the nickel cup that afternoon at the corner store . My ears were ringing . <p> Kate had left a message around one-thirty saying I should come over when I got in . " ... Okay . Bye-bye , sweetheart . " It was twofifteen . <p> Now , for some reason , the image of her sleeping with Blue was vivid and excruciating . I really loved Kate . I imagined her leaving a message on Blue 's answering machine . When I realized that 's what I was thinking , I felt crazy . <p> I looked out over the building next door at the clear dark sky and the shimmering line of lights on the Bay Bridge , visible in the distance . For about three seconds I thought of calling my father , who lived in Las Vegas now , and who I had n't seen since my older sister got married almost two years ago . He might-I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rouse himself and listen . But I imagined that he 'd get impatient hearing the details about Kate and that we 'd end up talking about him . He 'd say something like " It does n't sound good from here , guy . Now I 'm not trying to tell you what to do . . and it 's awfully late here . As a matter of fact , I was out a little earlier with a friend of mine . " <p> When my cigarette burned out , I scraped it against the window ledge and flicked it down into the alley . " I made soup , " Kate said . <p> We were standing on the futon . I had already pulled off my jeans and socks . Her apartment was dark and smelled like lentils . I realized I was starving . <p> Kate disappeared into the kitchen , scurrying over the floorboards in the main room as though she were crossing a no-man 's land , and came back with a coffee mug full of soup . " Thanks , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's spilling , so . . . " I swept the side of the mug with my finger and licked it , and then we sank down to the bed . Light came through the tiny closet window . I was still half-dressed . I sat against the wall with my legs crossed , and Kate lay down in front of me , the long way . She pulled a blanket over herself and my legs and then curled up close . <p> The soup was warm but not hot , so I was able to drink it . I leaned over to the edge of the bed and pushed the empty cup along the dusty floor until it hit the molding . When I slipped down beside her , Kate rolled toward me and drew her top leg up lazily between mine . She reached her arm around me and was still . She was already half-asleep . " Sing me a song " she murmured into the pillow . " I 'm really tired . " <p> She gave me a feeble little shake . Then she slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did fall asleep , I dreamed about Kate . We were walking in the Mission , and I was upset with her-because it was dark out and she was going off alone to meet someone , one of the mothers from the school . I was heading to the Rainbow Grocery to get syrup and milk for pancakes . When I got to the store , it was closed , and the lights were off . Through the glass door I saw something move , and when I looked closely I realized the place was filled with black people-churchgoers . They were dressed up and dancing , but there was something sluggish about their movements , and there was n't any music . It was a hot summer night , a Sunday , I remember , and this was a wedding . <p> I woke when Kate got up for work , and I asked if she minded me staying in bed for a while : it was rare that I did n't leave when she did . She said that that was fine , but I got the sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you can just check the handle when you leave , " she said . " You do n't need my keys . " " No , I do n't need your keys . " <p> Ten minutes after she left , I walked over to her writing table and started looking around for her spiral notebook . There were papers all over the place , typed pages from the novel . The apartment did n't have a lot of hiding places , and after I looked through a stack of magazines next to her bookshelves , I began to think that she probably had it with her . As I gathered my clothes , it occurred to me to check beneath the futon , and there it was . <p> I sat on the edge of the bed , still undressed , and began to flip through it . My heart was pounding . The cool thing to do would have been to just go home . But it was too easy to imagine sitting there in my place , wishing I 'd gone through with it . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even read the words , but gradually I began to take it in . Mostly it was just passages for her book and random thoughts and notes about what she 'd seen on the street : someone trying to sell The World Almanac for 1979 and an old pair of flippers-stuff like that . I saw my name here and there-short summaries of what we 'd done together and talked about-and I kept moving through it . She mentioned meeting Neil for a beer and wrote down things that he 'd said . <p> I looked carefully-I did n't want to miss anything , but I did n't really want to find anything , either . I looked for Blue 's name . I was steadily flipping pages , hoping to quickly shut the book and be done with it . <p> There was a draft of a letter dated June ioth to one of the writers in New York . It was short and full of cross-outs , but in it she said she 'd liked his book and was sending along some novel she thought he would enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't know the guy very well . She had given me the same novel along with some earrings and a gift certificate for Tower Records , for my birthday . It occurred to me , as I continued going through the notebook , that she probably decided not to mail it to him , and had given me the book instead . <p> There was an entry on August 4th , three days ago ; the rest of the pages were blank . I went back to the beginning-it started in May-and began skipping around in it . <p> Blue 's name appeared twice . A month ago , after we 'd all gone to a bar , she 'd described the way he 'd tapped her fingers with the box of cigarettes : " sexy gesture . " And six days ago , after one of our shows , she 'd written : " Blue thinks every woman in America should give him head . " <p> I reread an entry about a fight we 'd had , in June . " Horrible argument with Dean . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me saying , " You 're talking to yourself " - something I vaguely remembered-and then she described the way my place had looked , with the empty wineglasses and the candles . I put the notebook back where I 'd found it and pulled on my clothes . After tying my shoes , I dropped backward onto the bed and lay there in the sunlight , exhausted . After a minute or two , I sat uP . <p> There was nothing much about Blue in the notebook , nothing surprising . And no confession of the sort I 'd been imaginingthat Kate was interested in someone else , or wanted to leave the city . <p> You would n't have paid more attention to my name than to any other . That did n't necessarily mean anything , I supposed . But I felt defeated , sort of hollow and dull . Her apartment seemed very empty just then , and its dozen or so objects appeared carefully set apart from one another : lamp , folding chair , bookshelves ; my leather jacket , her little tin painted mermaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my jacket from where it lay in the middle of the room and left , letting the door swing locked behind me . <p> At home , I ate two oranges and took a shower . When I got out , I noticed there was a message on the answering machine . It was from Blue . " Pick up if you 're there , man . " He sounded wiped out . He did n't usually call so early . " Well , listen . I 've got some good news for us . I 'll tell you about it . See you at noon . " We were supposed to go over a couple of new songs . <p> I immediately wondered if we 'd gotten a contract . It could have been any number of things , I supposed , but it had to be fairly important , or Blue would have just said what it was . I called and got his answering machine . I could n't reach Jack or Michael , either . <p> It was n't even ten yet . I 'd planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ride to practice with Jack . Instead I grabbed my bass and headed straight to the studio , twelve blocks away , thinking maybe they 'd gone over early for some reason . <p> They had n't . No one was around . I set the case beside me on one of the couches and caught my breath . The space was a big converted garage on Divisadero that smelled like must and beer and old cigarettes . We recorded in Marin , but day to day , for practice , this was it . We shared the place with two other bands and a singer named Wendel , a tall , pale guy in his early thirties who pretty much lived there . Behind a hung bedspread in the far corner , there was a mattress , and he would sometimes come in with his girlfriend and disappear back there while we played . They 'd come out later going , " I liked that last one , " or something like that , and then stroll outside . People were always pounding on the door , interrupting us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was getting very old . <p> The place could be like a sweatbox after playing for an hour or two , but right now it was fine . I flipped through a wrinkled copy of Playboy for a minute-there were always about thirty of them sliding out from under the couches-and then tossed it back on the ground . <p> My hair was still wet from the shower , and I was in a sweat from hurrying over . Pretty pointless . But I really wanted to see Blue-and not only to find out what was up for the band . I wanted to talk about last night and get it over with . It seemed less likely that anything had actually happened between him and Kate . It did n't seem to matter as much anymore-there was no way Kate was going to end up with Blue-but I wanted to know . I thought I might be able to clear that one from my brain . <p> I lay down my bass behind some of the amps and left . I turned down Haight and headed back toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in cutoffs was checking me out as she came up the sidewalk . She was twenty , twenty-one . She was smiling and I nodded , trying to think if I knew her . As she passed me , she said the name of our band and then said , " Right on . " <p> It took me by surprise , and I mumbled , " Thanks . " <p> It was n't beneath me to flag someone like that down , but I was spacing out at the moment , and all it did was make me think of Kate and how sad the whole thing seemed . I 'd been off in dreamland , telling Kate that we 'd been signed . <p> Down by Steiner , there were a lot of people hanging out at tables outside the cafes , smoking cigarettes . There were motorcycles parked on the sidewalk , and someone was playing the Cowboy Junkies . I could easily imagine what it was going to be like walking by here on shiny , empty days like this while Kate was away . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of her crap stacked in one corner , wondering if she was really going to come back . It was bullshit . <p> Kate was sitting on the hill near the top of Dolores Park . There were little kids running back and forth between her and the playground area twenty yards away . She waved when she saw me coming and then shielded her eyes from the sun with her hand . Beyond her , off in the far southern corner of the park , there were about twenty guys in Speedos lying on blankets , catching rays , and some of them had dogs running around over there , chasing each other . <p> As I reached the top , two ot her kids came running up to her past me . <p> " What 's up ? " I said to her . <p> " Hey ! " And then to the kids , " Look who 's here . Ashley , David , say hi to Dino . " <p> They knew me , but they were shy : they were four or five years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her full attention . <p> " You 're all sweaty , " she said . " Wait a second , though . Little project going on here , right , Ashley ? " I dropped down beside Kate and propped myself up on my elbows . Ashley had both of her fists tightly closed and was holding them out . You could see she had something in her right hand . <p> " What 's the game ? " I said to Ashley . <p> She was staring at her fists . She took a breath and said , " You have to guess-which hand . " <p> " Ah-ha . " <p> " We 've only been playing for about an hour , " Kate said . It was totally obvious . Kate chose the empty hand . Ashley opened the other to display a large , bright green leaf that uncurled in her palm . <p> " Drats ! Fooled again . " Both kids were pretty pleased . " Good job ! You know what ? " Kate said . " I 'm going to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play again later , okay ? " They ran off down the hill . <p> We kissed , and Kate moved the hair away from my forehead . " So what 's going on ? A little jog , apparently . " I told her I went over to the studio too early and decided to come see her . She said , " Are you okay ? " <p> I said , " Kate , I wanted to talk to you . " <p> We were side by side , facing the Bay . She looked at her watch and then looked down . She 'd seemed nervous since I showed up . " That sounds grave . " I did n't say anything until she looked at me . " But go ahead . What ? It 's about Long Island , right ? " <p> " Well , yeah , that- " <p> " You could still come for a couple of weeks , you know . You should if you want to . It 's really beautiful . " <p> I was broke , we had gigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you know I ca n't . " <p> " My dad would lend me money until the check comes , and I already owe you some . " <p> We 'd had this conversation a month ago , and then it was dropped . It was only coming up now because I was scaring her . I could see how frightened she was , and I felt terrible . She was looking down again , and , as I watched , tears pooled into her eyes . When she finally raised them , she did n't look at me . She looked out over the water . <p> I started to think about the band again . It was Friday . We had a gig tonight across the Bay , in Berkeley . I thought about that girl who passed me on the street . A year ago , I would have been shocked . I could remember the first time that had happened and how it had seemed like one of the greatest days in my life . <p> Down below us was the Mission . Blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old post-adobe hotel on the corner of Valencia and 16th . It was an apartment house now with a Mexican market on its ground floor where we bought Hulk Hogan bars and flan that came on paper plates . A block or so from there , dwarfed by the distance , the big " 17 " hung over Mission Street . <p> For a second , I remembered clearly the moment Kate and I collided down there , and I felt a rush . There 'd been nothing exactly deep about it . As soon as I saw that she wanted me , I was all over it : I did n't ask questions . <p> But just as quickly now , the sensation slipped away . I kept looking down there , concentrating , trying to pull that feeling out of all these others-like when there 's a song you know , but you ca n't quite get it into your head . You go wait wait wait wait wait , because there it was , a second ago , and now it 's about a million miles away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . " <p> She did n't answer . She was sitting with her knees up , looking at her hand brushing the grass by her shoe . Her mouth was set in a thin line . She looked halfway between angry and upset . I knew that look well , but I never knew quite what it meant . " Do you want to marry me , Kate ? " <p>
