VARSITY TEAMS : 29 INTRAMURAL SPORTS : 16 FAMOUS ALUMNI : MARY ELLEN CLARK , KERRY COLLINS , FRANCO HARRIS EXTRA CREDIT FOR : CLASSIC FOOTBALL UNIFORMS // Never mind the 93,967-seat football cathedral or the basketball arena replete with skyboxes . If Penn State recruiters really wanted to lure prospective athletes to Nittany Valley , they would take them on a tour of the gift shops and bookstores that dot College Avenue in State College . It is there that one gets a blast of school spirit that assaults all five senses . Aside from viewing the massive inventory of school-logoed T-shirts and tchotchkes , petting thousands of stuffed Nittany lions and , on football game days , hearing tapes of the school marching band blared over loudspeakers , one can sample ( no joke ) Penn State Extra Chunky Salsa and even get a whiff of Nittany Lion Cologne ( $19.95 a bottle ) . // A tad excessive , this commercialism ? " Naw , that stuff is all in good fun , " says Joe Paterno , the venerable football coach , whose own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to show how caught up folks are in the athletic program . Besides , I 'd rather see our boosters buying hot sauce than buying players . " // Once a school whose athletic profile was visible only on fall Saturdays , when the football team played , among others , then fellow independents like Miami , Notre Dame and Pitt , Penn State underwent a sports face-lift in 1990 when it became the 11th member of the Big Ten . Football remains king , and though the old rivals have been supplanted by the likes of Michigan and Ohio State , hordes of alumni still converge on Beaver Stadium on game day from as far away as Hawaii , creating traffic jams miles long on single-lane Route 322 . So is Joe Pa still the most , well , lionized figure on campus , the eponym of Peachy Paterno ice cream at Penn State 's renowned creamery and the Joegie hoagie ( capocollo ham , Genoa salami and provolone on an Italian roll ) served in the dining halls . // But the Nittany Lions ' entrance into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking on stronger competition and reaping the fruits of conferencewide revenue sharing , Penn State has become a force in volleyball , women 's basketball and other sports . Moreover , as a condition for joining the Big Ten , the Lions had to retire some outdated facilities , including Rec Hall , the rickety field house that had been used for intercollegiate basketball since 1928 and was already scheduled to be replaced . In its stead the athletic department built the $55 million Bryce Jordan Center , a glossy all-purpose arena that just celebrated its first birthday . // The emphasis on spoils is n't limited to the varsity teams . Undergrads must take at least three credits in a recreational pursuit , such as fly-fishing , golf or power skating . The school also offers academic courses related to sports among them The Modern Olympic Game ! ( page 84 ) . And the College of Health and Human Development boasts a nationally renowned kinesiology department . // With a sprawling , pastoral campus perched in the heart of the Allegheny Mountains Penn State has more than enough playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , golf courses ( two ) and other facilities to accommodate a student body of nearly 40,00 , some 58% of whom participate in intramurals . The school has 57 recreation and sports clubs , including an outdoors organization whose 1,300 members do everything from kayak in Lake Perez 17 miles from campus , to ski at Tussey Mountain , just four miles away . // Simple geography helps explain Penn State 's rabid devotion to it : teams . Happy Valley is equally inaccessible from all points on the map This means that once students get to campus , they tend not to leave , forgoing road trips and instead catching , say , women 's hoop ; on campus . Those with some semblance of a valid I.D . showing then to be 21 or older gravitate to Damon 's Clubhouse or Champs Sport ; Grill to catch the Nittany Lions on the big screen and scarf Philly steak : laden with more cheese than Jerry Maguire 's mission statement . // " The students are a captive audience who are always around lo games , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus , " says Bruce Parkhill , a former men 's basketball coach who ' now an administrator in the athletic department . " This place is second to none in fan support . " Indeed , like the school 's fragrance , the fervor in Happy Valley resembles Obsession .
