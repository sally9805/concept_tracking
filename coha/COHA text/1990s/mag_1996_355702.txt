Moviegoers have been singing Tom Hanks ' tune for most of the ' 90s . A League of Their Own , Sleepless in Seattle , Philadelphia , Forrest Gump , Apollo 13 , Toy Story  --  each movie has been a surprise hit , proof of Hanks ' intelligence , craft and lopsided likability . Now Hollywood wonders , What can the guy do wrong ? <P> This . Hanks ' feature-film debut as writer-director , That Thing You Do ! , tries to infuse his personality in a story set in a time of innocence : small towns , state fairs , the modest dreams of being in a band and kissing the lead singer 's pretty girlfriend . But the transplant does n't take , because Hanks has n't given his 1964 fable of would-be Beatles ( or Byrds or Searchers ) the solid bass line of story sense . <P> The Wonders come together without cohering and fall apart without reason . We know the movie thinks the drummer ( the criminally cute , severely Hanksian Tom Everett Scott ) is the band 's soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we do n't learn what inspired the Wonders ' leader ( Johnathon Schaech ) to compose the title song  --  kind of crucial to know , since it 's played 11 times in the film . Other band members are mere ciphers ( Ethan Embry ) or shtick ( Steve Zahn ) . As their manager , Hanks is villainous or fatherly , depending on the script 's errant needs . Why he would create this franchise , then collude in its ruin , is a perplexing caprice . <P> There 's evocative atmosphere in the period detail and perky faux- ' 60s tunes . A pity these are wasted in a movie that , like many a pop tune , has a cute idea but a simpleminded lyric .  --  R.C.
