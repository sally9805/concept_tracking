txt Table Jeremiah worked in his smithy.53 In addition to such demarcation , women on their own formed a significant minority of licensees ? the proportion during this period ranged from a tenth to a fifth ( Table 2.2 ) . Almost invariably , they were widowed into that situation , as Eunice Clayton was to be . A rare exception was Elizabeth Wilson , who instead succeeded her father John at the Shoulder of Mutton . Some , like Jane Forrest , remarried . Others continued alone , though often with the aid of family , as Eunice did , or like Rebecca Wood of the Talbot , quaint of speech , but with a keen eye to business ' , who carried on there with the help of her son William for twenty-eight years after the loss of her husband , herself dying in 1843 , highly respected ' , at the age of seventy-seven . " Like Elizabeth Wilson and William Wood it was also quite common to be born into the trade . In this way , a family connection with a particular inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pack Horse John Middle-ton was landlord from 1762 until his death in 1797 . He was succeeded by his son Joseph , who presided over the house in turn until his death in 1818 , and whose widow , Sarah , then stayed on , later remarrying Samuel Corson , and died there in 1836 , finally ending a Middleton connection lasting seventy-four years . John Bradford , as we have seen , was succeeded at the White Swan by his daughter and son-in-law . Another daughter also married a publican , and three sons eventually followed in the trade , as did the three sons and a grandson of James Forrest , who took the Black Bull in Millergate towards the end of the eighteenth century.ss Such innkeeping dynasties ' , whilst never accounting for the majority of publicans , must nevertheless have helped to foster a sense of Bradford 's licensed victuallers as a cohesive group . Their individual staying time within the trade would confirm this . Over the five years from 1773 to 1778 , 57.1 per cent of licence holders remained within the trade , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing the business . And at the close of this period , in the five years from 1822 to 1827 , 72.4 per rent so remained . This is not , of course , to imply that there was no mobility within the trade . Although it can not be detected from the early licensing records , which lack the name of the house , other , albeit fragmentary , evidence does show movement between inns . This was sometimes upward to a larger business , as with Hugh Cryer when he left the Globe in Manningham for the Talbot in the mid-1780s . Similarly , when the Lister 's Arms was built in Bowling Lane in 1826 its first landlord was William Blackburn , who moved there from the old public house which it replaced.56 There was also movement into and out of the town . In 1811 the Sun was taken by William Gascoigne from the Star and Garter in Leeds , and , conversely , a Bradford landlord , Robert Belcher , also of the Sun , bought and refurbished the Red Lion in Doncaster , subsequently moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great north road.57 The sense of an innkeeping community is further suggested by the evidence of the licensing records , which show the publicans acting as each others ' surety for the good conduct of their house . In Bowling township in 1771 , for example , John Kellet and Samuel Galway , and James Harrison and Isaac Wilson acted as surety for each other , whilst the latter pair did so in turn for the fifth publican in the township , Ann Fieldhouse . In 1781 John and Thomas Middleton acted , respectively , as surety for five of their fellow innkeepers . In the new century it became common for the surety to be provided by someone from another branch of the trade . In 1827 the wine and spirit merchant , John Lee , did so for thirteen innkeepers , while Thomas Pullan of the Old Brewery did so for three , making together almost a third of the publicans in Bradford . Probably the most important fact , however , which helped to foster mutuality within the drink trade was the sharing of common concerns . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wines , spirits and food , the taxes and duties payable , the licensing system and the legal requirement to billet soldiers . These concerns had led by the late eighteenth century to the growth of national and local organizations to represent the trade , including a London-based friendly society with its own newspaper.58 It is not possible , though , to say whether local publicans participated in national developments , nor is there any evidence in this period of any formal organization of the trade in Bradford itself . What social position did this innkeeping community occupy in the town ? Like householders generally , the majority of publicans were tenants , but a significant minority owned their business . At the turn of the century probably about a third of the public houses were owned by their landlords , nicn like Joseph Middleton of the Pack Horse or Nicholas Mason of the Nag 's I lead . By the late 1820s that proportion had fallen to something like a fifth , though if one includes those cases where the owner had formerly been the landlord , or where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is virtually identical . ' ' ' For the rest , ownership was as yet no different from that of property generally , which was characterized locally by a prevalence of small freeholds.60 Although some larger landowners , like Lister , did include one or two inns amongst their holdings , more typical were small-scale property owners , such as shopkeepers and other tradesmen , or modest renters . Only towards the end of the period was there a tentative move into ownership by other sections of the trade . James and Thomas Laycock , grocers and wine and spirit merchants , bought the Rifle Man at Undercliffe in 1809 and later added the Hope and Anchor , Market Street , before going bankrupt in 1815 . But of more significance for the future was the purchase in the following decade of three public houses by the proprietors of the Old Brewery.61 Publicans themselves were also common amongst the wider group of small-scale property owners , and as such , were a part of the process by which Bradford 's built environment was created . Quite typical of such men was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear at Laisterdyke in 1818-19 , together with a number of cottages . Among publicans whom I have already mentioned , David Armytage , John Bradford , the Forrests , Nicholas Mason , John and Joseph Middleton were all owners of property to rent.G2 Some also were involved in the building society movement , which played a smaller , but important , part in housing the town 's growing population . Thomas Duckett of the Bull 's Head was one of the trustees of a building society which erected 48 cottages on land which it bought in 1807 in the Longlands . Similarly , Thomas Barraclough was a trustee of the Bradford Economical Building Society , which met at his public house , the Bishop Blaize , and which , from 1838 , built 68 houses in Westgrove Street.63 Whilst the majority of Bradford 's publicans were thus amongst its lowermiddle class , a minority did aspire to higher status . Some , like John Bailey and William Wagstaff , were able to retire , assuming the title of gentleman to indicate that they were living off their capital incomes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept the Bowling Green from 1815 . Their family physician was Dr John Simpson , a relation of Mrs Ward , who kept a journal during his brief time in Bradford . In it he recorded the death of their daughter Mary in 1825 , providing some insight into their way of life : Jan. 17th . I attended the funeral of Miss Ward of the Bowling Green inn , a young person sixteen years of age who died of consumption &; whom I had attended for several months . My fees amounted to thirty guineas which was paid me in gold . The funeral was a large one , the relatives being numerous . There was the hearse , one mourning coach and three chaises full of people . She was buried in a new family vault on the north side of the churchyard , which appeared to me as if it would hold at least twenty coffins ... " ' After the death of her husband the following year Susannah kept the Bowling Green , which she had been left together with ? 600 , for a further decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rawson 's Arms and the Sun . She then built for herself , at a cost of ? 1,150 a substantial residence , Field House , in a still largely rural part of Manningham township , which was soon to be developed as Bradford 's premier middle-class suburb . Whatever her pretensions , however , the trade followed her , and her new mansion was duly nicknamed Fool 's Penny Hall ' .65 None of Bradford 's innkeepers achieved the degree of wealth or social standing of some of those in other towns , who counted themselves among the rich and powerful.66 But a number were active at a more humble level in the life of the community , serving in one or other of the administrative positions which at this time were held voluntarily by ordinary citizens . Publicans from time to time held each of the four township offices of churchwarden , surveyor of the highways , overseer of the poor and constable . For the latter post they were technically ineligible ( the potential conflict of interest is clear enough ) , but they served nonetheless , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century father and son , John and Joshua Gibson , landlords of the White Horse in Kirkgate , served respectively as constable and deputy constable . Father John was responsible in that capacity , for example , for collecting a levy to raise a quota of militia in 1817 ; in 1830 , his son Joshua was the object , along with two colleagues , of a complaint to the magistrates from the secretary of the newly formed Temperance Society for relieving one of their distributors of his circulars and burning them.68 But these township offices carried little prestige ; they were unpaid and involved onerous duties , such that many places found it hard to recruit suitable people to fill them.69 In 1803 a new local government body , the Improvement Commission , was created by an Act of Parliament for the purpose of paving , lighting , watching and improving the town of Bradford and part of the hamlet of Little Horton , and for removing and preventing all nuisances therein ' . Among the subscribers to the fund for securing the passage of this legislation were several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duckett of the Bull 's Head , Samuel Risden of the Fleece , Nicholas Mason of the Nag 's Head and William Wells , a spirit merchant . These men were also among the fifty-eight commissioners named in the Act for putting its provisions into effect , but it also specified that none could serve who was a victualler , or shall sell ale , wine , cyder or any spirituous liquors ' . When Isaac Patchett took the Golden Lion in Leeds Road in 1835 he was obliged to relinquish the post to which he had only been appointed the previous year . ' " Overall , then , whilst publicans clearly played their part in local affairs , none of the foregoing evidence suggests the disproportionate power in the hands of the drink trade that was found in some ether t ( m ? ns . What was involved in running a public house in this period ? ' Ihiere can be little doubt that it was a demanding job , requiring a whole range of skills : craft , financial , organizational , social and psychological . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously vary with the public houses themselves , from the substantial coaching inn to the rough-andready alehouse , a point which should be kept in mind during this review of the publican 's lot . The trade called for considerable financial outlay . Where the landlord was a tenant , there was of course rent to pay . This might fall anywhere within a range of from ? 5 a year ( plus 6d. ( 2 ? p ) land tax ) for a small public house like the Three Blue Bells at Horton Bank Top in 1801 ? when it was raised for a new tenant to ? 6.10s. ( ? 6.50 ) inclusive of tax ? to the ? 130 a year in 1816 for a coaching inn like the Bowling Green . " For ownerlandlords the purchase money had , of course , to be found , or a mortgage repaid , as well as legal fees and stamp duty . The value of licensed premises rose in this period , linked partly to their general improvement . James Rhodes , for example , paid ? 330.15s. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with eight cottages . Five years later the inn alone fetched ? 370.72 On entering the house it was also customary to purchase the existing stock , plus furniture , fixtures and fittings.73 The new landlord might also wish to advertise , although , as this was expensive , only a minority did so . Apart from the expense , there was no local Bradford newspaper until the mid-1820s , and no permanent one until the Bradford Observer of 1834 . Of the few who did advertise , either on entry or to announce improvements , the following notice was typical , placed in the Leeds Intelligencer by John Longbottom on taking the King 's Arms in November 1778 : Those who please to favour him with their Custom may depend upon good Accommodation , and civil Treatment , and their Favours gratefully acknowledged , by Their most obedient , humble servant . ' After his death in 1781 his widow , Mary , similarly advertised the fact of her continuation of the business , hoping by a studious Attention to please , to merit a Continuance of the Favours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also extensive , and all of them seem to have been increasing in these years . A fee was payable both for the annual justices ' licence and the additional excise licence which was required to sell spirits and which was extended to beer from 1808 . Locally , there was the poor-rate to pay and , after 1803 , if the inn came within its remit , the new rate for lighting , watching and improving the town . There was a land tax payable to central government , but in this period taxes were also levied on such items as windows , dogs , horses , male servants ( and female , briefly , from 1785 to 1792 ) plus , for varying periods , on other items , including income . In 1830 the total amount of such assessed taxes alone varied between over ? 48 paid by Edward Hirst of the Sun to just under ? 3 paid by Edward Green at the more average-sized Black Bull.75 44 The greatest outlay was , of course , on food and drink . Wines , spirits and beers like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local merchant . An example of the resulting close financial , or indeed personal , relationship can he seen in the case of the merchant , John Lee , who acted as surety for several publicans . Like maltsters , wine merchants also often acted for publicans as trustees : for the receipt of outstanding debts , for the payment of creditors in the event of bankruptcy , or of their wills.76 For his basic beer , the publican was his own supplier ; brewing on the premises was the norm throughout virtually the whole of this period . From the maltster and from the grocer or hop merchant he obtained the raw materials ? malt and hops ? on which duty also was payable , as it was on the finished product , duties which all increased in these years . " In addition , the malt had to be ground , and if the inn was part of the Bradford soke ? that is , within two miles of the King 's Mill in Mill Bank and the Manor of Bradford ? it had either to be ground there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege of grinding it himself.78 The brewing itself , as we have seen , was done in a separate brewhouse . Although no contemporary local descriptions survive , an inventory of 1855 for the brewhouse of the New Miller 's Dam in Thornton Road is typical . There , for the key processes of mashing the ground malt with hot water ( liquor ' in brewing terminology ) , boiling the resulting wort with hops , cooling and fermentation the brewing plant comprised a mash tub , a lead liquor pump , a one-quarter pan and brickwork , a plank cooler and working tubs , plus pipes , steps , liquor strainer and barrels . " It seems likely that brewing was learned by experience , though there were a variety of guides available , like the Young Brewers Monitor , advertised in the local paper in 1825 as comprising a luminous and scientific Summary of that very ancient and important art ' . The contents of another such guide , which was used locally , are typical . Sound basic information was offered , such as the need for clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made brewing rather less straightforward than is suggested by a simple summary of its stages . Thus , it explained what to do if the beer was thick or muddy , sour , stale , hard or ropy . For stale or hard beer , for example , it recommended taking the upper crust of a loaf and toasting it very hard , covering it with mustard , cutting it into squares and adding them to the cask ; within two weeks the beer would be as mild as if it had only been brewed for a month or two.80 Some brewers went further and adulterated their beer to achieve certain results , though perhaps unwittingly , given the minimal contemporary scientific understanding of the processes involved . In July 1814 the Leeds Mercury published a warning 1'o publicans against using substitutes for malt , or attempting to make the beer more potent by adding opium and other drugs , which , as well as being dangerous , could also incur heavy penalties . During that decade , such adulteration nationally was at its peak , but , by 1840 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' I'hrre is no wily of knowing to what extent Bradford 's particular publicans were guilty of such practices , or of the more mundane subterfuge of watering the beer . Certainly , keeping good beer was fraught with difficulties , arising from the lack of cleanliness , for example , or from excessive heat or cold , so that many would find it hard to resist such steps in normal times , let alone when raw material costs were high . On a more positive note , the drinker at this time would have the choice of as many brews as there were public houses and individual publicans were undoubtedly noted for the quality of their beer in a rather more personal way than was later to be the case . Essential and time-consuming , carried out once or twice a week , brewing was still but one of the many activities of the publican 's trade . The house itself was open throughout the day and late into the night for drink and food . There was cleaning to be done , fires to be laid , accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks arose from the wide range of other functions which inns performed at this time , for example as transport centres and meeting places . There were also publicans who carried on other occupations . As we have already seen , some rural inns were also farms and , in general , keeping livestock was common . Not only , for example , did John Mitchell keep the Red Gin in Bowling early in the nineteenth century , together with the farm of that name , he also ran a local corn mill.82 David Armytage kept the Crown at Horton Bank Top , had farming interests and also mined coal under land which he rented for that purpose . " 3 The figures are probably underestimates , but in 1803 at least 8 of the 57 licensees in the four townships pursued a second occupation and in 1827 15 of the 72 did likewise . They ranged from trades in related areas , such as spirit merchant , butcher or coach proprietor to quite unrelated ones in textiles or mining . In those cases it was no doubt the landlady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public house . The public house business was a family one , of husband and wife in the main , but children had an important role to play , particularly if a woman was alone . It was also one that was dependent upon the employment of servants . Some idea of the extent of service may be gained by going a little beyond our period to the census of 1841 . Three-quarters of the 98 public houses that were recorded in that year employed at least one live-in servant . A principal inn such as the Sun employed ten people ? five men and five women ? though , overall , female servants predominated . The varied duties of these inn employees are subsumed in the census under the general designation of servant ' . Little specialization is revealed , with just one waiter , one brewer , four ostler/grooms and three coachmen . Elsewhere , there are scattered references to servants , as when a tragedy made them newsworthy . In December 1810 George Snowden , a post boy at the Sun , was drowned when watering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the inn . Also reported was the sudden death in July 46 1851 of John Watson , aged 22-I , for ten years underwaiter at the'Iiilhot and ' highly respected in his situation ' . " Occasionally , servants received bequests from grateful employers . In 1792 Abraham I , umh left Lucy Kitson 2 guineas over and above her wages , whilst , in his will of 1829 , ) avid Armytage left his housekeeper , Hannah Hanson , ? 20 plus the house that she occupied for the rest of her life , or until she married ? which she eventually did , to an innkeeper from Shelf . " s For that most characteristic employee , the barmaid , the only contemporary local reference I have found is an advertisement in 1817 from an unspecified inn seeking a young woman of irreproachable character , who writes a good hand , and has a competent knowledge of accounts for such a situation ' .8G The landlord and/or landlady , however , were the central figures of the business and their personalities were a crucial element in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one can combine what evidence there is with reasonable speculation . Sociability was clearly vital ? the need to chat , gossip , debate , joke or even entertain the customers . James Wade of the New Inn , for example , was a noted musical enthusiast ' . There was the sporting publican : David Armytage for instance , or Isaac Thornton , landlord of the Hare and Hounds at Undercliffe from 1788 to 1826 , who was always better known as ' Huntsman ' . " Drinking was an important part of this sociability and excessive consumption was a serious problem for publicans . Eunice Clayton defended her policy of keeping drunken men out of her house with the remark that she had bother eniff with her own drink without other fowks ' . There is no reason to suppose that the problem of drink-related disease was any less than later evidence shows . In 1880 ? 2 mortality from diseases of the liver nationally was 240 per 1,000 for innkeepers , compared with 39 per 1,000 for males generally.s " On this question of drinking , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light is shed by the case of William Oldfield , who was tried at York assizes in the summer of 1820 for the murder of his wife . What follows is largely drawn from a contemporary account . ' Oldfield had kept the Horse and Groom in Westgate since at least 1803 ( see Figure 2.8 above ) . He had married early in life , had a family , but subsequently remarried . Between his family and his second wife Mary there were continual quarrels which usually ended with William becoming violent towards her . It was after one such disturbance that Mary was found dead . A coroner 's inquest returned a verdict of wilful murder against Oldfield , accusing him of kicking , beating and striking his wife and throwing her on the floor . At the trial William Wheatley , a lodger at the inn , gave the following evidence : There arc two staircases in the house , one leading from the passage , and the other from the kitchen ; the former communicated with the lodging room of the prisoner and his wife , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ; but there is no communication 47 between the two suits ( +ir I of looms , except by coming down one staircase and going up the other ? r . I went to bed about hall-past nine o'clock on the night of the 27th of June , and was roused from my bed about twelve o'clock by a person coming to my room with a tankard , supposing me to be the waiter , to have some ale drawn . 1 , after this , fell asleep , but awoke some time after , when I heard two cries of Murder ' in a faint voice , which proceeded from the room of the prisoner , and which I believed to be the voice of Mrs Oldfield . Knowing that the prisoner had been in the practice of maltreating his wife , I did not think these cries anything extraordinary , and did not get up . The cries were succeeded by a perfect stillness . I then fell asleep again , and did not get up until five o'clock in the morning . When I came downstairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , at the bottom of the staircase , and I found , on examination , that she was quite dead and covered with blood ; her head was reclined on the frame of a chair . I immediately went up to the prisoner 's room , the door of which I found locked . I called to him , and said For God 's sake Mr Oldfield get up , your wife is lying dead in her blood . ' The prisoner replied How can I help it , a d  --  d infernal b-t-h . ' Blood from the deceased was on the door of the Oldfield 's bedroom and also in a footprint in the room of Benjamin Oldfield , a son of the previous marriage . Under cross-examination , Wheatley also stated that when he went to bed Mrs Oldfield was sitting by the fire in the kitchen and she had had some liquor , but was not put beyond her guard ' . Further evidence was heard from John Gibson , the deputy constable , and William Sharp , surgeon , who gave the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain , but could not be specific as to how it came about , a fall or a violent blow both being possible . In his defence Oldfield stated that he had returned from Halifax at about midnight to find his wife lying fully clothed on the bed in a state of intoxication , with a child lying beside her . He shook her to awaken her and in trying to get up she fell to the floor , subsequently fell again , before reeling out of the room . A further witness also testified to her state of intoxication . The jury found Oldfield guilty and the judge duly sentenced him to death , with the added provision that his body should be given to the surgeons for dissection . Leaving the court , Oldfield declared : My Lord , I am a murdered man . ' This was hardly surprising , for , as the account points out , on the evidence before it the jury had come to rather a hazardous conclusion ' . In fact , the case then took some curious turns . First , Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentence to stand . Then , on the eve of the execution , surgeon Sharp provided decisive proof ' that the injury was in fact caused by a fall , and that Oldfield had not followed his wife into the kitchen . This induced 48 justice Park to grant a reprieve , which was greeted by ( ) Idfield with floods of ' tears . I lc was afterwards sentenced to two years in York ( : astic , though transportation had been expected . The account condemns the case as ' a blot upon the legal accuracy of the country ' . Oldfield was , in effect , sentenced to two years for murder . The last-minute evidence was not given on oath and Park 's own investigations had led him to confirm the original verdict . Manslaughter should have been the charge . As it was , ' Public opinion was left at a balance ; many thought that Oldfield should have been executed , and as many that he was unjustly imprisoned . ' Drunkenness was also a problem among the customers . Another landlady to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Pal ' Hammond , who kept the Black Horse at Little Horton till she was in her eighties and who , when the orgies of her customers were at their height often asserted her authority in a manner to astonish even the rough collier lads ' .90 Violence was clearly a possibility , with the publican inevitably sometimes on the receiving end . One Sunday evening in April 1826 Abraham Normington , an engine tenter ( minder ) , went into the Wellington Inn in High Street and , when landlord Joseph Taylor refused to serve him , struck him for his pains.91 But publicans did not hesitate from using violence , as a result of which several cases against them in this period went as far as quarter sessions . In January 1775 , at Wakefield , Francis Simpson was fined ? 5 for assaulting Nathaniel Greenwood , a bailiff , and his wife , Sarah , ? 1 on a similar charge arising from Francis 's rescue while being taken to Wakefield prison . Eunice Clayton , too , faced assault charges in 1809 , but the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no case to answer.92 In addition to causing problems with their excessive drinking , customers also ran up debts to finance it . The extent of this is suggested by the frequency with which landlords had recourse to the courts . In Sheffield it was said in 1791 that a third of the suits in the court baron ? a manorial court such as the one in Bradford ? involved drinking debts . Local courts of requests , which were set up to deal with the recovery of small debts of less than ? 2 , included public house scores among their business , and such a court was established in Bradford in 1776.9 ' Outright theft was also a possibility . Of course , the takings were a prime target , as in December 1837 , when the locked bar till at the Commercial Inn was forced and ? 28 in gold and a quantity of silver were removed while landlord John Crook was taking a glass to an adjoining room.9 ' But a public house with its many , by definition , public rooms and the attractions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on , presented many temptations . In February 1782 Mary Newell of the Angel offered a half-guinea reward for the return of a carved two-handled silver pint , inscribed with her late husband 's initials . Publicans were also willing to go to the trouble of prosecuting those who were caught . Mary 's husband John , for example , had prosecuted one Joseph Jagger at Wakefield quarter 49 sessions in January 1775 for the theft of a riding coat , for which he was sentenced to be whipped . In 181 3 , also at Wakefield , William ? Meld successfully prosecuted a couple for stealing a silver jilt I.rn ' I and a number of items of clothing . And in the previous year , showing a further snare which publicans faced , two women had been convicted of passing counterfeit coins.95 Using the courts , however , was expensive , both of time and money . To overcome those obstacles , and to tackle particular outbreaks of crime , local associations were formed to apprehend and prosecute offenders . Lists of the initial subscribers to associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the participation of several innkeepers , albeit a minority of the total , and in the former year John Crossley of the Bowling Green was one of three men appointed to collect the subscriptions 96 Greater publican participation , perhaps a reflection of their increased substance , is revealed in the records of another such Association for the Prosecution of Felons , formed in 1817 . The landlords of the Sun , New Inn , Fleece and Britannia were on the first Management Committee , and others later either served or were ordinary members . The committee was elected annually and was responsible for arranging prosecutions , which , like the rewards offered for information , were financed from members ' subscriptions . Of the small number of successful prosecutions that the association 's minutes suggest were mounted , only a few were on behalf of publicans . In 1817 William Wagstaff of the Brown Cow was refused assistance after a robbery because the crime took place previous to his paying his deposit ' . In any case , by 1826 the funds were nearly exhausted , although , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist Susannah Ward of the Sun in cases of the theft of cash and of a tea and coffee pot.97 A further preventive measure , similarly funded by subscription , was the nightly watch in the winter months . This was , of course , yet another expense , as much as 14s. ( 70p ) for landlords of the larger inns , but one presumably deemed to be worthwhile until it was superseded by the Act of 180398 More serious depredations occasionally took place in outlying districts . At the Duke William at Tong in 1815 Joseph Hudson , the landlord 's son , was shot by robbers whom he had disturbed in the bar , and later died from his wounds . In 1829 the Red Lion at Bankfoot and the Coach and Horses at Bradford Moor were broken into within months of each other . At the former house , the robbers bored holes in the door with a bit and brace and then broke open the perforated panel before making off with ? 20 worth of spirits , tobacco and cheese . At the latter , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick and another iron instrument ' and relieved landlord Samuel Wood of three casks of spirits , several bottles of porter and a quantity of beef and other articles.99 The necessary discussion of the last few paragraphs should not lead us to too gloomy a view of the publican 's lot , apparently beset by violent 50 drunks , had debtors and thieves . ' I'Iic overall picture is somewhat rosier . In his national study Peter ( ; lark concluded : Tor most of the period up to 1830 the substantial , improved public house in a good position was an attractive business proposition ... ' .101 Locally , Bradford 's publicans certainly faced problems , such as the competition from the resurgence of illegal drinking places with their cheaper beer . They did occasionally come to financial grief , though the evidence for this period is sparse . Timothy Green , owner and landlord of the Rawson 's Arms , who went bankrupt in 1819 , may or may not have been typical.101 On the whole , though , the evidence suggests to me that Clark 's overall conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period became more substantial . With population soaring , especially after 1800 , and the growth in the number of public houses restricted , demand for their services must have risen , even allowing for the fall in per capita beer consumption , although , to offset this trend , spirit drinking increased ( see chapter three below ) . The rise in demand was all the more notable , as we shall see , because the services provided comprised much more than drink , being linked with trade and transport , which expanded as Bradford itself expanded . As a group , the publicans themselves , their ownership of property , their role in , for example , building development , the stability and sense of community of the trade , all point to the validity of Clark 's conclusion . The men and women whom we have met undoubtedly grumbled , and worse , about the many problems of their trade , which was certainly a demanding one , but which , for most of them , provided a comfortable living . 51 The Public House and Society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great number and diver sity of functions . Pre-eminently , of course , it was a place to drink and meet people , providing all the social and psychological satisfactions which that simple phrase implies . Its role at this time , however , was much wider than that . The public house also played a vital part as a setting for the admini strative , political and commercial life of the town : a place where magistrates sat , election committees organized , business deals were done and from which coaches and carriers ' carts and waggons departed . Moreover , dur ing the years covered by this chapter , as Bradford developed from a small , rural market town into a fast-growing industrial city , the importance of the public house for such activities increased . But by the close of the period , with the development of specialized administrative and commercial pre mises like courts and warehouses and with the coming of the railway , the withdrawal of many of those functions was also under way . This chapter aims to begin with an examination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was nevertheless charac terized overall by a great diversity of activity centred on the public house . ' Social centre The most common activity in public houses was having a drink in com pany ? company that consisted , for the greater part , of working men . What Joseph Lawson wrote of the alehouse in Pudsey , a village to the east of Bradford , that nearly all the male population went there , more or less ' , would be equally applicable to those of Bradford and its adjoining town ships.2 The only qualification needed here is that we should not forget that alternative drinking places were being provided , towards the end of this period , by sellers of whisht . Furthermore , although such a general state ment may be made with confidence , there is only fragmentary evidence relating more specifically to the customers . Occasionally , they were indicted at quarter sessions for offences committed there , when they are almost 53 invariably described generally as ' labourer ' , more rarely by a particular occupation , such as weaver . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two labourers ' wives and a labourer and his wife suggest that women too were to be found amongst the customers . ' Incidents meriting newspaper reports also provide glimpses into the public house . One example will suffice here . At the Angel , Westgate , early one Tuesday evening in 1818 , in a room occupied by some twenty to thirty people , William King , a joiner , was accidentally shot and killed when Stephen King , a youth from Thornton , brought in a loaded gun which went off when another youth took it from him . ' Finally , local antiquarians give examples of those who frequented particular houses , like the colliers we met through William Cudworth in the Black Horse at Little Horton . Similarly , William Scruton mentions the fresh-water-sailors ' who waited at the Wool Packs or the Ship for odd jobs at the port ' ? the nearby canal basin ? or the country folks ' , horse dealers and the like , who made the Three Horse Shoes their local . Another group to be found at the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early years of the century : these were the dobby weavers ' , possessing a particular weaving skill , who had their own specially reserved room separate from the tap room and its more humble customers . Lawson makes a similar observation about the Pudsey slubbers ? another skilled , male , textile occupation , which , like weaving , was eventually mechanized ? who , in their day , could earn twice as much as the hand-loom weavers , and , regarding themselves as superior , forsook their company in the tap room for the bar , where they drank spirits or superior ales . ' Men following the same occupation would naturally tend to socialize together . The public house in this way functioned as an informal information exchange for the various trades , or indeed as a source of more general news , since newspapers were commonly kept there. ? It acted , too , as a contact point for new migrants to the town ? after 1800 , an increasingly numerous group . Scruton illustrates this point when he writes of those drawn by the opportunities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leicester , Devonshire , and even from the Emerald Isle ; so that to spend an hour in a public-house ( the comber 's calling was a thirsty one ) one might have heard a perfect Babel of different dialects . " The drinking was also fuelled by the custom of paying wages at public houses , or of making a collective payment for several men in large denomination notes which required changing . This latter practice was described by E. C. Lister , one of Bradford 's first two MPs , to his colleagues on the 1834 Select Committee set up to inquire into drunkenness among the labouring classes . According to Lister , Saturday night was pay night and the main drinking night . Because of a currency shortage , employers paid out wages in ? 5 or ? 10 notes , which landlords obligingly changed , provided part of the money went for drink . ' 54 As well as serving as informal meeting places , public houses were also used by working men for more organized activities . Most significant were the friendly clubs , or societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , illness , disability and death . They would scene to have developed in the Bradford area in the third quarter of the eighteenth century : a Club ' had been formed in the nearby village of Idle in 1766 ; in Bradford itself a Benevolent Society was set up in December 1772 . ' In March of the following year the Union Society placed a notice in the Leeds Mercury to the effect that several evil-minded ' members had been excluded from the society for causing trouble by spreading ' scandalous and unjustifiable reflections ' to deter men from joining . What precisely had been going on is not made clear , but the notice does go on to state the purpose of such societies . The Union Society then comprised 120 members who , if sick , lame or blind and thus unable to work , were entitled to a payment of 6s. ( 30p ) per week if confined indoors , or to 4s. ( 20p ) if able to walk abroad ' . On the member 's death , a sum of ? 7 was payable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men aged between 16 and 30 , were invited to go along to the Bull 's Head on the first Monday in the month between 6 and 9 o'clock in the evening , where they will meet with suitable Encouragement ' . Another notice in September the next year provides further details of the working of such a society . By this time they had moved further up Westgate to the Pack Horse , where the landlord John Middleton had the important job of looking after the society 's box and effects . New members initially paid 1s. ( 5p ) , then 10d. monthly ; eighteen contributions were required before any benefit would be paid . Subscribers had initially to be of a sound and healthy constitution , and were ineligible if they followed the occupation of miner , delver , mason , bricklayer or carpenter ? customary exclusions of relatively risky occupations.10 Obviously the publican provided a meeting room , but what was further expected of him was spelled out in the ( fairly standard ) rules of a society at Great Horton , dated 1819 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another place , on a majority vote , if a complaint was proven of their not having good liquor or if members were not treated in a decent and respectable manner ' . Rule three , which specified the amount of members ' contributions , included 2d. for ale . In return for this guaranteed , albeit monthly , custom , the landlord undertook to provide a yearly feast ( rule 13 ) , good ale and a good fire ( rule 16 ) , and , as we have seen , security for the society 's box with its cash and books ( rule 17 ) . For its part , the society levied a 6d. ( 21hp ) fine on any member disguised in liquor ' ( rule 22 ) , and further inducements to respectability were the 10s. ( 50p ) fine , or exclusion , for getting drunk or frequenting game-houses or bawdy-houses ( rule 24 ) . In addition , benefits were not to be paid if an injury was the result of drinking , fighting , wrestling , bull-baiting , horse-racing or any other 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have venereal disease was to he excluded ( rule 2i ) . " Given legal recognition in 1793 , in the agitation for which Bradford men played a significant part , friendly societies thrived . ' . ) The special ' lodge room ' , usually upstairs , became a feature in many public houses . A wellattended society was an asset to a house . When , in 1831 , the Crown at Horton Bank Top was offered to let , the new and promising ' lodge of the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows was held out as an attraction to prospective tenants . When the inn was still to let the following year , the lodge was reported to be flourishing ' .13 By the close of this period the yearly feast had developed into a large-scale celebration . On Christmas Day 1835 1,100 Odd Fellows , with three bands , banners and emblems , set off in the morning from the White Swan in Wibsey and marched via Horton Bank Top and Shelf to the Westfield Inn at Low Moor , before returning by way of Oakenshaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their various lodges . Two years later , in October 1837 , the Odd Fellows opened their purpose-built , licensed hall in Thornton Road with another procession and a dinner for over 500 members.14 An outgrowth of the friendly society movement was co-operation for the purpose of building homes . These building clubs developed in Bradford in the early nineteenth century , and they too held their meetings at inns combining , like their progenitors , the practical with the social . The Bradford Commercial Building Society , for example , formed in 1825 , met at the Crown in Ivegate , as did the Improved Commercial Building Society of 1838 , which included in its rules the provision that each member was to spend 4d. ( 1 ' /p ) every month on liquor . " As we saw in the previous chapter , publicans themselves were active in the societies . Although societies like these received , in general , the support of respectable opinion , as the legislation of 1793 shows , there were misgivings . ' 6 Organized activity by working men of a more overtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of this period . It also posed potential problems for publicans since it was , of course , in their houses that working men met . Licensing law placed them under the control of the magistrates . In 1792 , fears generated by the example of the Revolution in France led the justices in Manchester and Oldham to threaten publicans who permitted their rooms to be used by seditious groups or individuals with the non-renewal of their licence . In Bradford , too , there was strong local elite opposition to Levellers and Republicans ' . In 1799 the law was further strengthened , providing penalties , including loss of licence , for allowing unlawful combinations and confederacies , or the reading of seditious or immoral publications . " It seems unlikely , however , that publicans would have been willing to incur that risk , and , in any case , many of them would share the fear of extremism which prompted it . And as we have seen , the whisht shops provided 56 an alternative meeting place . Only alter the relaxation of these prohibitions in I825 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public huses . In September of that year the linen Drapers ' Assistants not at the Bull 's 1 lead where they passed a resolution which criticized their long hours and which sought the closure of shops at 8 p.m. on weekdays and 1 1 p.m. on Saturdays . Two years later the Beehive and the King 's I lead were used as sites by woolcombers to pay members of their union who were on strike against wage cuts imposed by the firm of Garnett . And in January 1835 a dinner was held at the Black Bull , by admirers of his political principles ' , to celebrate the 98th anniversary of the birth of Thomas Paine . This was a contrast indeed to September 1792 , when Paine 's effigy had been torn to pieces in Bradford and some of his supporters obliged to leave town.18 Fear of the authorities might still make licensees cautious , but after 1830 , as we shall see , working-class political and trade organizations had an alternative , lawful meeting place in the new beerhouses . Of the daily and nightly round of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the whisht shop and the beerhouse , Joseph Lawson again provides a description : At the alehouse , besides talking about the gossip of the village , spinning long yarns of various sorts , cracking jokes , etc. , they would play at dominoes , shuvving the penny ' , marrowing each other 's coins ' , or odd man-ing ' , and at puff and dart ; or , if during the day , they might play at brasses , quoits , and skittles ? all for ale . Or they would be singing songs , all joining in the chorus when there was one , or in the last two lines if no chorus . The songs were like the times and the people , as they generally are ; mostly on love , drink and war . " Here , then , are the three most characteristic and enduring pub activities : talk , music and games . The essential subject-matter and types of talk , from political discussion to gossip about a neighbour 's affairs , the jokes and banter , are of course timeless ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically took the form of communal singing , as Lawson describes , though from later evidence one can suggest also that instruments were played , such as the fiddle , either by a regular customer or by travelling musicians . Of the games , some were of relatively recent origin , like dominoes which was imported from France , whilst others , like quoits , had been played at least since the Middle Ages . They were frequently accompanied by gambling , usually for drink , which was illegal at this time . Some of them are still recognizable to us in the late twentieth century , whilst others are obscured by their dialect name . Brasses was similar to quoits , with round pieces of iron or brass being thrown from a shorter range . In marrowing , one man put down a coin covered by the hand and a second put down another to match it . Odd man-ing was also a gambling game , 57 involving the tossing of ' coins , though it was also the name of a game of cards , as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dart , the dart was blown through a long narrow tube at a circular board with numbers painted clockwise on it ? the winner was the person who struck the three highest numbers.2 ' ' There is no doubt that these games could become heated at times , and , with the singing and the noise of talking amplified by drink , some places would be fairly rowdy . When Jonathan Gott was convicted in July 1827 of keeping a disorderly house , probably a whisht shop , in George Street , constable Benjamin Williams reported as follows : On Tuesday the 15th of May about nine in the evening , I went to his house and found 18 men and boys drinking and gambling and making a most shameful noise . I could hear them when I was 30 yards from the door . In one room they were playing at dominoes , and in another they were sparring . ' He also noted that some of the boys were as young as ten , and that they were a generally very low sort of people there ' .21 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Scruton , also organized sports and games for the operative classes ' . These included prize fights , perhaps the sparring ' at Gott 's place , but also cock- and dog-fights , usually held in the yard.22 However , this probably refers more to the whisht shops and beerhouses than to licensed houses , from which , by 1800 at least , blood sports had been excluded . In earlier times cock-fighting had formed an accepted part of the inn 's social activities , one which appealed to all classes , as a typical advertisement in the Leeds Mercury in 1745 makes clear . This was for a three-day cock-fight to be held in the pit at the house of Thomas Eastburn , between the gentlemen of Bradford and those of Wharfedale , involving thirty-one birds on each side , with bets of two guineas a battle . In Manningham township the Globe Inn also had a cockpit , and on Whit Monday 1773 and the following two days the gentlemen of Bradford and those of the north ' fought , with forty-one birds on each side.23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at inns . There was a bullring for that purpose at the Bull 's Head in the old market place but , according to John James , it was a rare occurrence there within this period . Similarly , the stone post to which the bull was tethered in front of the Black Dog Inn , Wibsey , had been redundant from as long ago as 1700 . But in other places , in contrast , it survived for much longer.24 The connection between licensed public houses and these types of blood sport was , however , effectively ended from the mid-1780s with , as we shall see , the exertion of greater magisterial control over their conduct . Thereafter , the public house remained as a gathering place only for the devotees of those sports , like fox-hunting , shooting and coursing , which retained their respectability and legality . In October 1837 the Bradford Pigeon Club , for example , enjoyed a sumptuous dinner ' at the Albion Hotel , Ivegate , after a shooting contest . The Bradford Coursing Club had its special room at 58 the Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported an ' enuuinently successful ' season , = , The ' gentlemen ' of liradfurd were thus among the customers of the public house in this period . Although much of their social drinking was enjoyed in their respective homes , middle-class gatherings like the masons or the ' club ' based themselves at inns . The Lodge of Hope Number 539 of the Free and Accepted Masons , with an initiation fee of two guineas , held its first meeting at the Talbot in April 1794.26 The Oyster Club also met there , or at the Bull 's Head , mixing the social with the practical , as ' the spinners , manufacturers , and gentry of the town met to enjoy oysters and cold punch , and discuss politics and the commercial news , brought fortnightly by the Hamburgh sic mail ' .27 More substantial dinners were a common social function , held for a wide variety of annual celebrations and special occasions . We have already come across the shooters and coursers and just one further example will suffice here . In May 1804 on their return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were regaled at various inns , whilst the officers dined at the Sun with the gentlemen of the town.28 By the close of this period demand for catering like this had grown enormously , and in the absence of competitors it was the public houses which met it . The gentlemen were joined by the ladies at the inn ( other than when travelling ) only for the dancing assemblies which were held at the larger houses , like the New Inn , the Talbot or the Sun.29 John Simpson acted as one of the three stewards to these subscription assemblies in the 1824 ? 5 season and has left us this description : We had dinner at 5 o'clock and at eight went to the ball at the Sun Inn . We had a very pleasant and respectable meeting . I danced with Miss Graeme , Miss Jowett and Miss Harriet Skelton : with each partner a country dance &; quadrille . I got to bed about three in the morning . Our dances have been very pleasant ones and well attended . We should have had four , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bishop Blaise we only had three . The subscription for the three for Gentlemen was one guinea &; for Ladies fifteen shillings . Out of this we found the room , lights , music , tea and attendance . We had four musicians to whom we gave half a guinea apiece each night . We engaged for tea and sandwiches at three shillings a head , &; after paying all the expenses we have a surplus of seven or eight pounds.30 Although the public rooms of inns provided the main accommodation for such gatherings ? and for others as we shall see , well beyond the scope of the purely social ? they were not the only rooms available to meet a growing demand . From its opening in 1773 , the Piece Hall in Kirkgate was also used for public meetings , such as the one early in 1801 to discuss 59 an appeal to the King for an end to the war with prance . The resultant petition was available for signature , as was commonly the case , at the principal inns of the town and neighbourhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for music , along with the parish church and Nonconformist chapels . ' ' There were , in addition , two successive assembly rooms , where concerts , balls and other events such as public lectures were held , though in Bradford they were hardly the grand buildings which the name suggests . The first , in the late eighteenth century , was in a building in the yard of the King 's Arms in Westgate , which was also for a time used as a theatre , whilst the second , from the turn of the century , was in the old market house.33 Neither they , nor indeed the inns , were felt to be adequate for their purpose . John Simpson makes that plain , in his customary tone , in his journal : We have long felt at Bradford the want of public rooms . We have no regular assembly rooms , a very bad news-room , a wretched room for the public library &; no decent billiard room . ' 3-I By that time the largest public room in the town was in the new court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be inadequate.35 The lack was finally remedied in 1828 with the opening of the building in Kirkgate which became the Exchange . Bradford 's middle and upper classes now possessed a purpose-built social centre , comprising an assembly room , plus separate library , news- and billiard-rooms.36 Though social activities did not entirely cease at public houses , the opening of the Exchange had a twofold significance for their future . It was the first purpose-built social alternative to the inn , and its opening confirmed the retreat of the middle and upper classes from the inn 's social world . Administrative life Throughout much of this period public houses provided accommodation for a wide range of administrative bodies , comprising the courts , local affairs and the agencies of the central government . Only from the 1830s did the move by a majority of them into specialized premises really get under way . The quarter sessions for the West Riding , which combined both judicial and administrative functions in their round of the various towns in the county , met at Bradford each July . Until the 1770s they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the King 's Arms , but most often at the Moot Hall . Thereafter , part of the new Piece Hall was converted for their use.37 At other times magistrates also dispensed summary justice in petty sessions , which were often held at a convenient public house . The New Inn in Bradford itself was regularly so used , at least by the 1820s . In the same period E. C. Lister used the Lister 's Arms at Manningham , which was close to his home , Manningham Hall , whilst John Sturges of Bolling Hall similarly presided at the Wheat Sheaf , the principal inn of Bowling 60 township . The business of these courts , including the special hrewster sessions ( ur licensing public houses , also held at the New Inn , were transferred in 18 i4 to a purpose-built court house in I fall ings. ( ) nly rarely thereafter were inns still utilized , as when Matthew Thompson heard cases in 1836 at the Upper ( ; lobe near his home in Manningham.38 Public houses also provided the location for other judicial forums . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convened at a public house until the opening of its Darley Street court.39 The ancient manorial courts , baron and leet , which heard civil and criminal cases respectively , made the reverse move . The old manorial court building was sold in 1797 , and their proceedings eventually found a home at the Manor House Inn where they continued to be summoned even as their already limited functions dwindled into obsolescence. " 0 A court martial was held in the town on at least one occasion ; at the White Lion in December 1837 two privates of the 97th regiment each received one month 's hard labour at the treadmill for being drunk on the march between Keighley and Bradford . " Another special court , that of the revising barrister who determined entitlements to vote in the new parliamentary borough of Bradford created in 1832 , met at the Talbot in September the following year , before it , too , found a permanent home in the new court house.42 Finally , one type of court which , above all , met at public houses , and continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coroner . After the assassination of the Prime Minister , Spencer Perceval , in May 1812 , for example , although the jury viewed the body at Number Ten the verdict was decided at a public house on the corner of Downing Street.43 Normally , both functions of the court took place at a convenient public house . Cases were frequently reported in local newspapers . In September 1826 , to cite just one example , an inquest was held at the King 's Arms at Great Horton into the death of Benjamin Dewhirst of Lidget Green , who had been found the previous day hanging from a tree . His daughter proved to the jury 's satisfaction that he had been in a depressed state of mind ' for some time , due to want of employment ' , and a verdict of insanity ' was returned. - " The close association of coroners ' courts with licensed premises attracted the attention of Dickens . In Bleak House , published in 1852-3 , he portrayed an inquest in a first-floor room at the Sol 's Arms , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coroner , he wrote , frequents more public-houses than any man alive . The smell of sawdust , beer , tobacco-smoke , and spirits , is inseparable in his vocation from death in its most awful shapes . ' " 5 Local government was also , for most of this period , largely conducted in public houses ( publicans themselves , as we saw , were active participants ) , but it too was moving into specialized premises towards its end . The unit of local government was the parish of Bradford , but within its considerable extent the actual responsibilities , covering church affairs , 61 highways , policing and poor relief , were carried out at the level of its thirteen constituent townships . In Bowling , for example , township meetings were usually held at the Wheat Sheaf , more rarely at the Red Gin , or at the workhouse , before removing eventually in 1837 to a committee room in Mill Lane.46 Affairs in Manningham were conducted at the Globe throughout the whole period , until it merged into the new borough.47 In Bradford itself the vestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were often adjourned to inns , where general business also was transacted.4 " When the new local body , the Improvement Commission , was created in 1803 , the enabling statute specifically mentioned the Bull 's Head for its meetings . In the event , the commissioners rotated their deliberations between several inns before eventually settling at the relatively modest White Horse in Kirkgate , whose landlady , Mrs Gibson , was allowed 2s. 6d. ( 121/p ) for the use of a room , somewhat cheaper than the 10s. ( 50p ) charged by the landlord of the Fleece in 1805 . Subsequently , they moved to the Darley Street court house , thence to a committee room in the new Exchange and finally in 1838 to the Station House in Swaine Street , which was built to house the watchmen and the fire service as well as their own meetings.49 Government at this time was largely conducted at a local level . Central government only really impinged on the localities in two forms : through the collection of taxes , and the military . Public houses were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for national taxes , and publicans acted , as did other local people , in the capacity of collector . John Greenwood of the Globe , for example , served as one of the two assessors and collectors of the land tax in Manningham in 1787 and ' 88.5 ? Similarly , in the year to April 1836 , the collector of assessed taxes was John Blackburn of the Lister 's Arms , Horton . Appeals against assessment were heard at the Talbot until , by 1839 , they moved to the Tax Office in Piccadilly , and in the following year to the new court house.51 As for excise duties , the office was located successively at the Bull 's Head and the Bowling Green until the 1840s , when an office was opened in Albion Court.52 In time of war public houses served as collection points for special taxation for military purposes . They were also used generally as bases for recruiting.53 Their most important military function , however , and one which innkeepers had a legal duty to fulfil , was the provision of accommodation for the troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new footing by the so-called Innkeepers ' Bill of Rights , which instituted a system of fixed allowances and payment by the military authorities in place of soldiers paying from their subsistence allowance . The rates per day were 10d. for food and small beer , or 2d. if the own food then the landlord had to supply free candles , vinegar , salt and 62 up to five pints of small beer or cider a day . " Bradford was not a garrison town , but the long war against France was accompanied and followed by a disturbed period in its history during which it was several times deemed necessary for troops to he deployed there . Although alternative accommodat on was sometimes used ? as the old market house and a warehouse in lyrrel Street were in 1826 ? public houses provided the main billets . During the so-called plug riots of 1842 , for example , the Bradford Observer noted that the soldiers were billeted at various inns , with the main barracks in the yard of the George Hotel.55 These continued to be so used even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The obligation remained deeply unpopular with publicans , who felt that the allowances which they received were quite inadequate.56 Political life The public house played a key role in the electoral process , as both meeting place , and , at a time when beer was its essential accompaniment , as purveyor of drink.57 This was no less true of Bradford , although only relatively late in this period . Before the Reform Act of 1832 the town had no independent parliamentary representation ; local electors voted in the huge Yorkshire constituency . Moreover , in that constituency there was not one contested election during the whole period from 1741 to 1807 . In 1806 , however , there was due to be a contest and the candidates made the usual preparations . A meeting was held in Bradford on 23 October at the Talbot to promote the Tory cause , and a week later their candidate , William Wilberforce , delivered a speech from the steps of the adjoining Piece Hall , as earlier his Whig opponent Walter Fawkes had done . In that same week Fawkes 's supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose the Bowling Green . In the event , a second Tory candidate withdrew and no poll was required . For the contest the following year they were back again at the Talbot.58 The Yorkshire electorate had then to wait until 1830 for another actual contest , though sometimes there was at least the chance to see candidates making preparations . In 1826 , for example , it was reported that large crowds were collected in front of the various Inns where the committees for the Candidates were sitting ' . The Whigs were headquartered at the Sun , a liberal Tory at the Bull 's Head , the staunch Tories as usual at the Talbot 59 From 1832 Bradford elected two MPs of its own , and contests became the norm . In the election of that year the Tories were again based at the Talbot , the Whigs at the Bowling Green and Sun.60 Before the end of the decade there were two further elections . In 1835 , in addition to the central committee rooms in the same three inns , the new local paper reported the candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Radical , spoke to meetings at the lower ( ; lobe in Manningham , the Royal Engineers at Bowling and the Red Lion at I , ittle I lorton , whilst ' Ii ) ry candidate John Hardy addressed a very considerable concourse of persons ' at Great Horton from a platform in front of the King 's Arms , to a decidedly unfavourable reception ' . Acknowledging his eventual defeat to 5,000 people outside his Sun headquarters , Hadfield praised the fact that the election had been peaceful , in contrast to the revolting outrages ' in Blackburn and Rochdale , where 6 people were reported to have died from excessive drinking . Prior to this election , in fact , the Bradford Observer had warned : Let there be no treating on the one hand , or intimidation on the other . ' In its wake , the Bradford Temperance Society , expressing a view somewhat at odds with that of Hadfield , viewed with the deepest regret and abhorrence the scenes of intemperance and intoxication which prevailed ' .61 During the election of 1837 there was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by a brass band , headed a procession four abreast from Tory headquarters ? this time the White Lion , Kirkgate ? to the hustings . They were outdone by the Liberals , however , as four bands made their way from Lister 's seat of Manningham Hall to a triumphant entry into the town ' , where 20,000 people were gathered . The nomination ceremony was itself disorderly , following a pattern established during the campaign , and violence continued through the next day 's poll . It culminated in a savage brawl between miners and ironworkers from the Low Moor and Bowling strongholds of Tory candidate Hardy , and the Radical hand-loom weavers and combers.62 Though subsequent parliamentary and , from 1847 , municipal elections did not always generate quite such heat , drink and the public house remained for some years beyond this period essential elements of their conduct . Commercial life In the commercial life of the town public houses also had a significant role to play , one which grew as the town itself developed . But , although in aggregate more commercial activity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business was increasingly being conducted elsewhere , in specialized premises . By the middle of the eighteenth century Bradford was well established as a textile centre , though as yet behind Leeds , Wakefield and Halifax . Whilst local manufacturers displayed their finished pieces at their homes , those from outer districts used rooms in , or adjoining , public houses such as the Sun , King 's Arms and White Lion . At the former , a warehouse was opened in August 1762 for the sale on market day of woollen stuffs , perhaps prompting Jonas Fox of the King 's Arms to assure merchants in 64 October tint ut his inn they could always depend , as they hail for some years past , on meeting with the best manufacturers . ' ' ' Although the Piece I fall was erected in 1775 for this purpose , and a second hall not long thereafter , inns continued to provide facilities for the display of piece goods , and manufacturers attending the halls based themselves there . By 1822 , according to a trade directory of that year , 313 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public houses . Chief among them were the Nag 's Head , next to the Piece Hall itself , which 63 men used as their inn house ' , and the Shoulder of Mutton on the opposite side of Kirkgate , the base for for a further 30 manufacturers.64 In addition to its importance for the textile trade , Bradford was the general market centre for the district , and the sale of produce such as corn was transacted in the warehouses , passages and yards of inns as well as in the market itself.65 Several publicans , as we have seen , also carried on a second trade at their house . It was not only on market days that the public house provided a convenient and convivial place to do deals , sealed with a drink . Day-to-day business was also transacted there . The diary of Abraham Balme , treasurer to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal Company , shows this as , for example , on 20 January 1775 : Dined at the Sun and made an agreement with Jarratt and Co. for the coals. ' 66 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun in July 1766 to consider a navigation between the East and West Seas ' , and , from its foundation , general assemblies of its shareholders were invariably held at an inn.67 The meetings of turnpike trusts , private bodies set up to build , improve and maintain roads , were also held at inns . In June 1770 , for example , the trustees of the turnpikes through Bradford from Leeds to Halifax met at the Golden Cock to consider erecting a new toll bar , and in August , this time at the Sun , they met again to issue a contract for building a bridge over the north beck near Halifax.68 Other business more or less routinely conducted at public houses included job interviews , the settlement of accounts , payment of rents , the leasing of property , creditors ' meetings and auctions of all manner of property : bankrupts ' effects , houses and land , mills and warehouses , beds of coal or stone , standing timber , company shares and the tolls of turnpike trusts . And at the King 's Arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auction of a Valuable Museum of Natural Curiosities ' , including sea shells , the head of a porpoise , shark skeletons , a set of real Indian bows and arrows and a China umbrella made from an animal 's skin.69 Inns also provided a convenient base for itinerant providers of a range of professional services . In December 1776 a Mrs Harrington , for one day only by appointment at the Sun , offered likenesses in miniature after a three-minute sitting for 2s.6d. ( 12'hp ) ? no money changed hands unless a perfect likeness was obtained . Medical help for man and beast was commonly available throughout this period . In July 1778 Mr Alsop , a surgeon dentist from York , was at the Cock on market days catering for all ailments 65 and selling medicines such as a diet drink for scurvy , ' infallible ' at Is. ( 5p ) a quart . And in 1839 Mr Swift of 1 luddersfield offered to cure deafness at the Druids ' Arms , whilst Mr Childs visited every eight weeks at the White Swan to remove blindness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Talbot and the Bowling Green , and in the mid-1840s Abraham Hanson , cow doctor , received his patients at the Nag 's Head.70 Though public houses thus retained their commercial functions , business was also increasingly conducted elsewhere . In the textile trade there were purpose-built warehouses with office accommodation , and by the 1820s distinct warehouse districts were developing . Also in the new century market halls and retailing from shops largely replaced the old open stalls and trading at inns . Specialized premises were also being opened for other services , like the auction mart established in 1823.71 Business generally was increasingly done at the office , and , where conviviality was required to smooth its progress , no doubt the new Exchange and the later clubs fulfilled that need . Although the negotiation of private business in public houses was still common at the end of this period , it is clear that it increasingly withdrew to alternative premises , following the example of public affairs . One other commercial function increased enormously in this period , the one most frequently associated with the inn ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was only one element in the overall transport system , which included various forms of private conveyance and carriers ' carts and waggons . All of them relied on the services of the public house . Of course , to get anywhere the vast majority of people walked . Lawson tells us , for example , of Pudsey clothmakers walking the four miles back from the market in Leeds , calling at alehouses along the way.72 For those who could afford horse transport , inns offered several services . One 's own horse could be baited there , that is , fed and watered . It was also possible to hire horses to ride , or to use with one 's own carriage , travelling post , as it was called . Alternatively , several types of carriage could also be rented.73 All public houses were equipped to provide at least one of these services ; none was without stabling , and , indeed , well beyond this period , magistrates absolutely required it before the grant of a new licence would even be considered . A small number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of services . In May 1779 the new landlord of the King 's Arms , John Longbottom , advertised that he had recently bought chaises ( a light , open carriage for one or two persons ) and horses , which he offered with careful drivers to gentlemen , travellers and others . The Sun also offered neat post chaise , steady and able horses , careful drivers ' . Innkeepers co-operated in the provision of the post service . On the route to Manchester the landlords of the Sun in Bradford , the Talbot at Halifax and the landlady of the Roebuck in Rochdale announced in July 1809 a reduction in their posting to ls.3d. ( 6p ) per mile for each pair of horses . This forced a similar response from a competing trio based at the . h1bot , Bradford , the White Lion , I lalifax , and the Old Tame , who saved two miles on the journey by omitting Rochdale . In addition their post boys would drive customers to any house they wished . The choice of carriage became more sophisticated . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let not only saddle horses but also hackney coaches , phaetons and neat gigs ' .74 Cheaper than travelling post , although still beyond the range of most people , was coach transport . Bradford was first linked into the burgeoning coaching network in the mid-1770s , when the New Post Coach running between Leeds and Manchester called there . The fare was 12s. ( 60p ) to sit inside , 7s. ( 35p ) outside . Trade directories show the growth in services thereafter , from just two daily departures in 1792 to eight by 1814 , eleven in 1822 and twenty-seven by 1828 . According to William Scruton , the King 's Arms was used by the earliest coaches , but would appear to have been fairly quickly superseded , first by the Nag 's Head and the New Inn , later by the Bowling Green , which was joined in the new century by the White Swan , the Sun and the Talbot.75 The operators of coaches organized innkeepers along the route to provide a change of horses in return for a share of the profits.76 Some innkeepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swan was in partnership with William Green of Leeds , and himself drove , along with two other men , the Highflyer coach from York to Liverpool , a service which commenced in 1807 . By the mid-1820s Bradford and Green were running seven services and the White Swan was the busiest coaching inn in the town . Bradford 's son , Thomas , continued in the business , but moved operations in the mid-1830s to the Bowling Green , which then became pre-eminent throughout what remained of the coaching era.77 Another coach business was operated by Edward Hirst and partners from the Sun , which he took over in 1824 . Five coaches were advertised as calling there the following year , but the enterprise would seem to have been shortlived , and Hirst himself died in 1832.78 Certainly , coach operating could be a precarious business . It involved considerable overheads , including the coach and horses and their respective upkeep , licensing fees , turnpike tolls , the wages of coachmen , guard and ostler , the cost of newspaper adverts and general office expenses . It demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of road conditions . And , not least , were the threats posed by accidents and competitors . In his book on the coaching days in Yorkshire , Tom Bradley listed thirty-five coaches which , at one time or another , stopped at Bradford . Of that number , seventeen ran for five years or less , of which , in turn , no fewer than thirteen ceased operating within a year . ' ' Viewed in that context , the Bradfords were singularly successful . 67 What was the reality of coach travel ? The following is an account of a journey from Bradford to London in October 1772 : Sunday . About five o'clock in the afternoon set forward with my spouse for London . Took Mr Johnson 's then landlord of the King 's Arms I chaise to Leeds , where we arrived safely a little before seven o'clock . Went to bed about nine , and were called up a little before one on Monday morning . Got into the coach along with Mrs Lister about half-past one , and arrived at Wakefield , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pint of wine for us , and afterwards set forward to Barnsley ... so the journey proceeded to Leicester , with halts along the way for refreshment and to change the horses ... Here we changed coach and horses , and set forwards about four . We reached Market Harborough about six , and about two miles before this parted with a fat fellow passenger , much to our relief . About two miles beyond Market Harborough we changed horses , and got a little brandy and water . We also took inside the coach a poor girl , who had been starved in the basket all night , and reached Northampton at nine o'clock . After breakfast we set forward for Hockley-in-the-Hole , which is 162 miles from Leeds , and reached it at three in the afternoon . Here we dined and changed coaches . Set forward about four , but had a drunk and dilatory coachman and bad horses . These had to be changed twice on the road , and the road was heavy . We reached the Swan Inn , Lad Lane , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-seven hours from leaving Leeds.80 The functions of the inns en route are clear enough . They also provided accommodation , although once on the road the Listers , in common with other travellers , stopped only for food and drink , perhaps so as not to prolong further an already lengthy and expensive journey . Bradford 's principal inns , like the Bowling Green , Sun , Talbot and later the George catered to commercial gentlemen and better-off visitors generally . The Marquis of Anglesea , for example , stayed at the Sun when he came to visit Mr Mann for an artificial leg to replace the one he had lost at Waterloos ' Lodging was also available , as we saw in the previous chapter at the Horse and Groom . Food was provided by public houses generally , for daily needs to special dinners . Competition in this area was as yet negligible : by 1822 there were , according to the directory of that year , just three eating houses in the town . What the general standard of food and accommodation was is difficult to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell of poor food , poky rooms and overcharging , but , equally , compliments are duly paid.82 The Listers ' long journey time was in fact half what it had taken twenty years earlier , and would be halved again by the first decade of the new century . The perils of the weather which their journey also illustrates seem only to have caused really long delays at their most severe.83 More worrying 68 was the threat of accident , to which drinking by coachmen was a not uncommon contributory factor . When the York Mail overturned at the foot of a steep hill on the road from Halifax to Bradford in May 1831 the driver was reported as having set off in a state of brutal drunkenness ... utterly incapable of managing his horses ' . Four years later , within a week of Samuel Yates beginning to run the Water Witch coach from his Roebuck Inn to Leeds , his coachman , John Goodrick , was accused of being drunk and negligent when it overturned in Well Street , killing a passenger . Yates had promised presumably anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also noted drivers ' racing and the overall frequency of accidents , preferring to travel where possible by steamboat. ' 1i-avcl this way to London , for example , was via Selby and Hull , and was said to be not only safer but more comfortable and cheaper.85 It was the railway , however , which finished long-distance coach travel , although for a time coaches did provide feeder services to the new stations . Thus in 1834 the Perseverance left the Bowling Green for Manchester to connect there with the Liverpool train , and similarly the Railway 69 coach left the Sun to meet the trains from Leeds to Selby . After 1837 , when the line from Leeds to Manchester opened , connecting coaches met the trains at Brighouse . By 1840 the North Midland was leaving the Sun and Bowling Green coach offices for the Leeds to London train , which overnight had halved that journey time . On local routes , though , coaches continued to run , and in 1836 Thomas Bradford introduced an omnibus service to the town.86 By 1845 a directory for that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen for the market and three summer coaches to Ilkley and Harrogate , which collectively used the services of more inns than ever before ( Figure 3.2 ) . The following year , on 1 July 1846 , the railway from Leeds to Bradford via Shipley finally opened , with eighteen hourly trains a day and a journey time of 30 ? 35 minutes , half that of the coach.87 Thereafter , omnibuses and coaches survived to only a limited extent , usually just so long as the route remained without a rail connection . The coaching era was over , leaving antiquarians to write of it with a nostalgia that future generations would bring in turn to the steam train : Pleasant and familiar sounds were the blowing of the horn , and the clatter of the horses ' hoofs ... the splendid style in which Rockingham 70 loop ' , with his lur-in-hand , drove up to the very windows of the Bowling'preen ... And the polish on the coachman 's face , too ; the combined work of storm and breeze , of heat and cold , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aided by daily supplies of the best Yorkshire ale . When shall we behold his like again.ss Less romantically remembered , but equally important in local life well into the nineteenth century , were the carriers . Transporting goods , and sometimes passengers , their services expanded with the economy and population . Trade directories once again show the scale and pace of that growth from the late eighteenth century . Though some carriers had their own warehouses , public houses were their most common base . By 1830 thirtyone carriers were using twelve inns on market days , and in 1845 sixtythree carriers were based at twenty-one public houses . These were for local deliveries , like George Brumfit , for example , who was based at the Pack Horse on Mondays , Thursdays and Saturdays to carry goods to Addingham or Mrs Butler , at the Commercial on Mondays and Thursdays , who provided services for Gomersal . Long-distance deliveries went from warehouses : by 1845 , among six of these , Pickford and Company had an agent at one in Brook Street , delivering daily to all parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the public house in this period was much more than simply a place to drink and to socialize . Its important role in the wider life of the community has been , I trust , amply demonstrated . Yet its role as a drinking and social centre remained paramount . To understand that fact we need to understand too the culture of drinking which prevailed in this period . This in turn will lead on to an examination of the crucial legal context within which public houses were run . The drink culture Alcoholic drink was an essential part of life in this period . To quote Lawson once again , it was drunk by all , rich and poor , old and young , parson and cobbler ... ' .90 For the very poorest , the workhouse dinner was washed down with beer . In 1795 , the rules of the Bradford poorhouse noted that Women giving Suck are to have two Pints of Beer a Day for the first Year only ' , whilst in 1829 a daily pint of beer was allowed for all paupers over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's journal makes clear , alcoholic drinks were widely and regularly consumed . For some , that consumption could be considerable . Simpson 's own father drank a bottle of gin a day for the last ten years of his life.92 Heavy drinking was widespread among working men , with some occupational groups , such as combers , colliers or foundrymen , especially noted for their thirst . 71 That drink was a necessity of life , and heavy drinking common , is Ix .. yond doubt . Less certain is exactly how much was consumed . National statistics in fact show a decline in beer consumption , I rom an average of 33.9 gallons per head per year in 1800 ? 4 to 28.4 gallons per head in 1825 ? 9 . Consumption of spirits , in contrast , increased , particularly in the latter half of the 1820s , from 0.75 proof gallons per head in 1800 to 1.17 in 1830 . These figures , however , underestimate actual consumption at this time , and of course do not permit particular comment about the Bradford area , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a more short-term rise in the drinking of spirits.93 Locally , home-brewed beer remained important . Lawson described it as a great institution ' , which most women could produce . Because of the variety of utensils needed , neighbours co-operated by aligning brewing days for their mutual convenience . For John James , looking back to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries from the mid-nineteenth , the practice of domestic brewing was then as it is now , commoner in this district than probably it is in any other part of England ' . Other evidence , such as the sale particulars of properties ? though usually farms or larger houses ? with brewhouses attached , and some occasional reported thefts of a brewing tub , support this view94 The publican , too , as we have seen , was also a home brewer . This was , thus , easily the most commonly consumed drink . Reliance on the products of common brewers was some way in the future . For virtually the whole of this period , Bradford had just one brewery , known as the Old Brewery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong , dark beer originating in London , which was supplied both to publicans and the general public.95 The actual London and Dublin product could be obtained from Leeds , and by 1814 a firm of porter dealers , B. and W. Hoyland , was trading in Bridge Street . In addition , by the 1830s bottled Edinburgh and Burton ale became locally available.96 At the Old Brewery there was also a distillery producing gin , and , in addition , the firm sold foreign brandy and Jamaica rum . A 1792 directory also listed Charles Booth , wine merchant , Samuel Crossley , brandy merchant and Elizabeth Wells , spirit dealer , both the latter combining the trade with another occupation . By 1830 a directory included seven wine and spirit merchants and a dealer in British wines . The latter , Richard Hargreaves of Kirkgate , was also a grocer and sole agent for Bentley 's ale and porter . His stock of wines included raisin , cowslip , currant , ginger , orange , gooseberry , raspberry , elder , mountain and tent , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks which the better-off enjoyed . He , and those with whom he mixed , drank Madeira , sherry , Bucellas , port and white port , claret , punch , brandy punch , raspberry brandy , champagne , moselle , white wine negus ( with hot water ) , and also brandy and gin , usually also taken with water . This list did not exhaust the possibilities : the Compleat Housewife : or , Accomplsh 'd Gentlewoman 's Companion , which 72 went through several editions during the eighteenth century , listed over forty recipes for various wines , punches , beer , ale and cider ? " Alcoholic drink was thus habitually consumed by the majority of the population , and by many to excess . What underlay that fact ? Foremost was that there were as yet few alternatives . Tea had not yet assumed its later importance . Locally , according to Cudworth , its price was still too high at the beginning of the century to threaten the dominance of homebrewed beer . When it was used , it was necessary to make a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6d. ( 2 ? p ) was generally made to last a week . Nationally , while the overall amount of tea which was drunk rose in these years , consumption per head was practically unchanged until the mid1840s , though it had by then become established as a necessity.99 As for coffee , although nationally per capita consumption rose faster than that of tea from the 1820s to the 1850s , there is little reference to it locally , apart , for example , from a coffee room for the town 's middle class at the close of the eighteenth century.100 The supply of water was always inadequate and easily contaminated , and the situation worsened as the town expanded . ' ? ' Milk was drunk , though it too could be contaminated or adulterated , and was often boiled.102 Soft drinks were only just beginning to appear locally : at the beginning of the nineteenth century an agent in Bradford dealt in Albin 's patent sweet acid for making punch , lemonade and negus , but only from the 1830s were there local manufacturers of soda water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of daily diet and not a relative luxury with which to complement it , so also was it not something enjoyed only in leisure time . It was an essential feature of many workplaces . Much work in this period continued to be done in the home , by such as handloom weavers and woolcombers , who of course could drink as and when they chose . Combing in particular , for which the combs had to be kept constantly heated , was a thirsty job . But beer was also taken into workshops and warehouses , quarries and foundries.104 Work also provided opportunities for special drinking celebrations . At Low Moor ironworks , for example , blowing-in ale ' was distributed among the forgemen every year on 16 August to celebrate the first casting made there in 1791 . More regularly , new workers were required to pay a footing ' , a sum of money for drink , to which fellow workmates also contributed . Among builders and related crafts the rearing ale ' was drunk when the roof was completed . As Joseph Rogerson noted of the rearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and joiners were in great spirits in expectation of plenty of Ale &; a good Supper ' .10 ' It was not only manual workers who had their drinking rituals ; business was commonly transacted over drinks . When John Simpson and his fellow proprietors launched their newspaper in 1825 , they did so at the Sun Inn , with a good supper and a famous bowl of punch ' , a glass of which served for its christening.106 73 ( ; hristenings , weddings , funerals , all manner of festivals and Frosts , and of course great occasions , were alike accompanied by much drinking , 10f In April 1770 , to celebrate the release of John Wilkes from prison and the famous issue of his journal , the North Briton , Richard Shackleton , landlord of the Bull 's Head , organized a bonfire of 45 loads of coal and a supper of 45 pounds of beef and other meats washed down with 45 gallons of ale and the same of bowls of punch . When news came of the taking of New York in November 1776 it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging of the rebel chiefs ' in effigy ; gentlemen drank their toasts , whilst barrels of ale and money were given out to the populace . At such times , even children were not neglected . In 1814 , as part of the general thanksgiving for the allied victories over Napoleon , 500 children were given plum cake , cheese and spiced ale at the Methodist Sunday school , and thus were early taught to rejoice in the prosperity of their country ' .108 A divorce of chapel and drink had thus clearly yet to be effected . William Cudworth also noted how the singers at the anniversary of Bowling Wesleyan Methodist school were given good home-brewed ale ' for their efforts.109 The greatest celebration in Bradford was the septennial commemoration on 3 February of Bishop Blaize , the patron saint of woolcombing . The scale of the festival seems to have grown with the town and attracted the whole district . In 1811 Rogerson reported that hundreds were heading there and that his mill was idle , all our men gone to Bradford ' . The next occasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most respectable yet , with over a thousand in the procession and 30,000 spectators . In 1825 it reached its apogee , after which the gentlemen enjoyed their usual dinner , whilst others had sandwiches , ale and punch in a field , where some , according to Simpson , got very tipsy . That festival thus ended less respectably , and though in future commemoratory dinners were still held , it was to be the last of its kind.110 Alcohol drink was viewed positively . It was seen as good for you , a source of nourishment and strength , both physical and mental : as the comber had his beer , so too clergymen were not averse to small glasses of brandy to prepare them for the fatigues of oratory , or to enable them to ascend the stairs to bed ' . " Dr Simpson freely prescribed alcohol for his patients : to cure a rather indisposed Mr Mann , for example , he took along two bottles each of port wine and claret.112 At the very least , it acted as a pain killer . Informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against spirits . In 1786 the Leeds Mercury reprinted an article from a book which examined the effects of spirits both on the human body and on society as a whole . It pointed out the connection with poverty and crime , illness and death , and sought to counter such common misapprehensions as their efficacy in keeping out the cold.113 Some went further , such as Dr Mossman of Bradford who in a letter to the Mercury in 1802 , 74 argued the destructive effects of ' all types of drink . But , for medical men , and indeed fur opinion generally as consumption rose , spirits remained the main focus of concern . In 1831 , at the request of the newly formed ' li ? mperance Society , a declaration signed by all the medical practitioners of Bradford was inserted in the Mercury : In our opinion nothing would tend so much to the improvement of the health of the community as an entire disuse of ardent Spirits , which we consider as one of the most productive causes of disease and immorality , and amongst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From its inception , the temperance movement sought to counter the idea of drink as a source of nutrition and strength , and realized too its wider importance in society than simply as an intoxicant . ' " A changing climate of opinion can also be seen in attitudes towards heavy drinking . Working men continued to view positively the ability to drink to excess . A middle-class toper like Simpson could write approvingly of Mr Hudson , who , at the age of 80 , was still a master in a public school , and who could take as much wine as anyone at table ' . But , on the whole , his journal , whilst offering many examples of heavy drinking and drunkenness in his own circle , clearly shows that , for the middle class , it was by then ceasing to be acceptable behaviour.116 About the heavy drinking of the lower orders , they showed no ambivalence : they were against it as they always had been , but the level of concern over this period seems to have risen . That , in turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house operated . The legal context The law was concerned with alcoholic drink for three reasons : to tax it , to suppress drunkenness and to regulate drinking places . It is with the second and third points that I am here concerned . To sell drink , publicans required a licence issued by the justices.1 " This had to be applied for in person at special annual licensing meetings of at least two justices , known as brewster sessions , which were held each September . Bradford was within the Morley sub-division of the West Riding and the sessions were held either at Bradford itself or at Halifax , the other main town of the division . The occasion was also doubtless an opportunity for publicans to get together to discuss trade news and general gossip . To obtain a new licence , the applicant was required to produce a statement signed by a minister of the church and a majority of the churchwardens and overseers , or else of three or four reputable and substantial householders , testifying to his good fame , sober life and conversation ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it common alehouse or victualling house lot one year and thus to sell victuals , beer , ale , cider and other excisable liquors . For drink and bread the licensee had to keep the common assize the statutory price . No unlawful games , drunkenness , or any other disorder were to be allowed , but good order and rule were to be maintained . lb sell spirits , a further licence had to be obtained from the excise , a requirement which was extended in 1808 to beer.118 In addition to the justices ' licence , publicans were further required to enter into recognizances of ? 10 , together with either one or two sureties totalling a further ? 10 , whose terms were the same as those of the licence itself . The clerks of the peace kept a register of both licence holders and sureties . The law also governed certain aspects of the running of the business . Drink had to be sold in standard quart or pint measures , in marked vessels made of wood , earth , glass , horn , leather or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous drinking ) in the house , on penalty of a fine of 10s. ( 50p ) , whilst the tipplers themselves faced a fine of 3s. 4d. ( 17p ) . Drunkenness , again on the part of either landlord or customer , was also an offence , the penalty being a fine or alternatively six hours in the stocks . The licensee , in addition , faced disqualification for three years . That penalty also applied to any licensee who permitted gambling , which was prohibited specifically with cards , dice , draughts , shuffle-boards , mississippi ( a type of bagatelle ) , billiards , skittles and ninepins , by any journeymen , labourers , servants or apprentices . This was the state of the law at the beginning of this period . Authority over public houses rested with the local magistrates . But how strictly was that authority exercised and the law enforced ? Unfortunately , there are no surviving records locally of either brewster or petty sessions on which to base a judgement . In their national study of licensing policy the Webbs concluded that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granting and renewal of licences was a matter of routine. ! ' 9 The surviving statistics of licences held do tend to support this view , in that the fluctuation in numbers during the 1770s suggests that they were in fact fairly readily granted , but no clue is offered as to why a particular licence was given up . Certainly , by the 1780s concern was being voiced in the West Riding as a whole about the increase in numbers and its baleful consequences . In the borough of Leeds , for example , in 1786 the immense multitude of the lower sort of alehouses ' was the source , according to the Intelligencer , of the nightly depredations committed in the town and neighbourhood ' . And in that same year a correspondent from Bradford to the Leeds Mercury called for the abolition of blood sports , the punishment of drunkards and the suppression of those alehouses where the lower orders of people meet for gambling , tippling etc ' . ' 2 ? A policy of restriction was in fact now inaugurated by both the Leeds and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 76 Fitter announced the desirability of ' a general reduction in the number of public houses and gave notice that all publicans offending against the law would have their licences withdrawn and their recognizances estreated . Accordingly , at the ensuing Barnsley and Wakefield Brewster sessions , licences were refused to several publicans who had entertained tipplers , particularly on Sundays , or who had encouraged such activities as cockfights , hull- and bear-baitings . The following Easter they adopted formal resolutions not to grant new licences until the present number shall have been considerably reduced ' . Then , in June of that year , George III , at the instigation of William Wilberforce , issued his Proclamation for the Encouragement of Piety and Virtue , and for the Preventing and Punishing of Vice , Profaneness and Immorality ' . At the very next quarter sessions , at Bradford , the justices resolved to exert themselves to the utmost of their powers , in order to carry his Majesty 's proclamation into full effect ' . Constables were urged to be diligent in ensuring strict obedience to it.121 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constables of Thornton and Allerton among those approving a document signed by the curate and churchwardens of Thornton chapelry , which set out a code of conduct for publicans . This forbade the sale of alcohol after ten o'clock at night and restricted its sale on Sundays , warning that all persons found tippling or drunk , but especially on a Sunday , would be presented to a magistrate . ' 22 The immediate cause of this move towards restriction was the growth of the evangelical movement , which was particularly strong in the West Riding . Its aim was a general reformation of manners ' , encompassing vice and obscenity , Sabbath-breaking and profanity , as well as blood sports and drunkenness . 123 In fact , drunkenness was probably no worse than it had ever been , though population growth might have tended to make it more noticeable , and , in reality , the growth in the number of public houses in the 1770s had been only modest . Furthermore , the new policy of restriction failed to bring about any marked decline . In the Morley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 392 to 385 by 1803 , but in Bradford there was a small net gain of three.124 What the policy did achieve was a virtual freeze in their overall number and an impetus towards greater respectability through a weeding out of particularly badly run houses on the one hand and , on the other , a willingness to grant new licences only to substantial properties . This analysis would certainly seem to apply to Bradford , although the picture is not entirely clear . John James wrote of a list of 50 inns and public houses in the town around the close of the eighteenth century , adding that the vicar , John Crosse , presented a memorial to the licensing magistrates against the renewal of 10 of their licences . It is not stated , however , to what extent the memorial was successful , if at all , or indeed when it was presented , or to what area the worryingly round figure of 50 actually refers . ' 25 Some houses certainly did disappear though , and it is not unlikely that the new policy was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the new century . Before the brcwster sessions of 1808 , held at the Upper George in I lalilax , the constables and principal inhabitants ' were again urged to inform the justices of any houses that were not conducted in a regular and orderly manner . In 1817 , at Bradford , licences were refused to several public houses within the division for permitting tippling on a Sunday and other irregularities.126 On the other hand , as we saw in Bradford , there was an increased willingness from about this time to grant new licences to suitable premises . This policy , it must be noted , involved no change in the law , but merely the use of existing powers . These were exercised not only with regard to the granting of licences , but also to evening closing times , closure during the hours of divine service on Sundays , and the sale , on that day , of spirits.127 In 1822 , however , owing to the defective and insufficient ' nature of existing law , a temporary , amending measure was passed by Parliament . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the surety to ? 20 . It also extended the provisions of the recognizance and the licence to include the sorts of restrictions brought in from the 1780s : an explicit prohibition , for example , on permitting cock-fighting and animal-baiting , and restrictions on drinking during divine service or at night , except by genuine travellers.128 But the most important statute was that of 1828 , which replaced existing legislation and formed the basis of licensing law until 1910.129 Recognizances and sureties were no longer required . The justices ' licence authorized its holder , upon obtaining the necessary excise licence , to sell any kind of excisable liquor . This was subject to the following basic conditions : that there should be no dilution or adulteration ; that legal standard measures be used ; that no drunkenness or disorderly conduct be permitted , nor persons of notoriously bad character allowed to assemble ; that there should be no unlawful games or gaming ; and that the house should not open during divine service on Sundays , Good Friday or Christmas Day . No provision was made regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be held between 20 August and 14 September , and provision was also made for no fewer than four , nor more than eight , transfer sessions . For new applicants , the statement of good conduct was no longer required , but prior notice had to be given to the overseer , constable and the public on the door of the proposed premises or of a church or chapel . Finally , applicants were granted a right of appeal to quarter sessions against the refusal by the justices to grant , transfer or renew a licence , or against any summary conviction . A third conviction would lead to forfeiture of the licence and disqualification of its holder for three years . Whilst licensing law was thus now consolidated , within two years the whole system of magisterial control of the drink trade was effectively to be set on one side with the creation in law of an entirely new drinking place ? the beerhouse. 78 The Beerhouse , 1830 ? 1869 Free trade in beer The Act of 1830 , to permit the general Sale of Beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real turning point in the history of the public house . ' It provided for the creation of a new type of drinking place out-side the control of the justices ? the beerhouse . Within 20 years , there were in Bradford more beerhouses than houses for the sale of all types of alcoholic drink , which continued to require a justices ' licence . The long-established trend of slow growth in the number of ( legal ) drinking places now came to an end , together with its marked failure to match the rise in population . By 1869 , when the beerhouses were brought under magiste rial control , there were some 460 in the town , over three times the number of licensed premises . By that date also the beerhouse had become a ubiqui tous and characteristic feature of Bradford 's working-class neighbourhoods . There were several reasons why the 1830 Act was passed . In its own words , it was to provide for the better supplying the Public with Beer ' . One immediate reason that the public was so favoured was the desire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagging popular support . Another was the wish to boost the consumption of wholesome beer instead of spirits , and , accordingly , it was accompanied by an increase in the duty on spirits and the complete abolition of beer duty.2 Increased beer production would also benefit growers of barley and hops who were suffering the effects of a general depression in agriculture . Over the longer term , the measure reflected widespread dissatisfaction with the existing licensing system , which neither the legislative changes of the 1820s nor the relaxation by justices of their restrictive policy had alleviated . Whigs and radicals opposed what they saw as the arbitrary authority exercised by the magistracy , a system that they felt favoured the Tory-supporting drink interest . Free-traders looked to the opening up of the trade to promote competition and thus revive falling beer consumption . The drink trade itself was divided . Many brewers and publicans opposed the measure , fearful of its perceived threat to their businesses and to the value of public house property .
