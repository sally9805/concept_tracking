I have here three new books and an I.Q. score . The books concern Wall Street 's fallen financiers . The I.Q. belongs to Nelson Peltz . It 's not as titillating as , say , Dan Quayle 's ( now there would be a columnist 's dream come true ) , but it does hold some interest when you consider that Nelson 's net worth  --  which 10 years ago was roughly the size of your own , give or take a few million  --  is pegged in the just released Forbes 400 at $600 million . <P> The first book , Dennis Levine 's Inside Out : An Insider 's Account of Wall Street , is junk , bound . Do n't waste your time . Instead , to learn about Levine and Ivan Boesky and particularly about Mike Milken , read James B. Stewart 's spectacular Den of Thieves . I read it because , like most people , I was n't entirely sure . Was Milken , though guilty , the victim of a witch hunt over largely technical violations ? Were he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense ) and Ken Lerer ( for the p.r . machine ) , the ones I should root for ? Hah ! For the first time , it all comes clear . And guess what : the crooks were the crooks , and the feds were the good guys after all . <P> After reading Den of Thieves , you may in fact wonder whether Milken , whose 10-year sentence made folks gasp , did n't get off easy . Sure it 's a waste to have a genius cleaning toilets . But if the downside of crime is appointment to a Treasury post , or some other challenging job , then where is the downside really ? <P> And then there 's John Rothchild 's delectable Going for Broke , due out next month . It describes how Robert Campeau , a flamboyant French Canadian real estate developer who had absolutely no retailing experience  --  who at the time of his bid may have never even been in an Allied department store !  --  managed to acquire first Allied and then Federated , ultimately controlling a U.S. retailing empire with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A short time later , of course , Campeau 's empire collapsed  --  but this is my point ! Campeau went bust ; Trump 's on a leash ; the guy who rented the QE 2 for his son 's bar mitzvah sank ; Boesky , who arrived at that bar mitzvah in mid-cruise via friend John Mulheren 's helicopter , went to jail ; so did Mulheren , briefly ( but not before setting out with an assault rifle to kill Boesky ) ; the S &L; boys are in the soup ; major insurers are having their ratings lowered ; M &A; star Bruce Wasserstein looks a little silly  --  and you mean to tell me that out of all this , unscathed , emerges Nelson Peltz ? <P> The image of Milken scrubbing floors and Peltz presiding over hundreds of millions is remarkable , at the least . As described in Connie Bruck 's exceptional 1988 best seller , The Predators ' Ball , Milken made Peltz . He suggested Peltz buy giant National Can , and then American Can , among others , and then floated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Previously , Peltz had had a minor , mediocre business career . But soon the can business entered a profitable cycle , and Peltz , and his more highly regarded one-third partner Peter May , would be lionized on the cover of Business Week . ( " In your book , " one of Peltz 's advisers told Bruck at the time , " call him Nelson the Industrialist and make us all vomit . " ) In 1988 the can business would be sold to the state-owned French giant Pechiney , yielding Peltz , Milken et al . a nearly $1 billion profit ( and spawning its own insider-trading scandal among French government officials ) .
