" Someone 's going to get hurt out there , " said Dr. Claire Elliot , looking out her kitchen window . Morning mist , thick as smoke , hung over the lake , and the trees beyond her window drifted in and out of focus . Another gunshot rang out , closer this time . Since first light , she 'd heard the gunfire , and would probably hear it all day until dusk , because it was the first day of November . The start of hunting season . Somewhere in those woods , a man with a rifle was tramping around half-blind through the mist as imagined shadows of white-tailed deer danced around him . " I do n't think you should wait outside for the bus , " said Claire . " I 'll drive you to school . " Noah , hunched at the breakfast table , said nothing . He scooped up another spoonful of Cheerios and slurped it down . Fourteen years old , and her son still ate like a two-year-old , milk splashing on the table , crumbs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without looking at her , as though to meet her gaze was to come face to face with Medusa . And what difference would it make if he did look at me , she thought wryly . My darling son has already turned to stone . She said again , " I 'll drive you to school , Noah . " " That 's okay . I 'm taking the bus . " He stood up and grabbed his backpack and skateboard . " Those hunters out there ca n't possibly see what they 're shooting at . At least wear the orange hat . So they wo n't think you 're a deer . " " But it looks so dorky . " " You can take it off on the bus . Just put it on now . " She took the knit cap from the mitten shelf and held it out to him . He looked at it , then finally , at her . He had sprouted up several inches in just one year , and they were now the same height , their gazes meeting straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wondered if Noah was as acutely aware of their new physical equality as she was . Once she could hug him and a child would hug back . Now the child was gone , his softness resculpted into muscle , his face narrowed to a sharp new angularity . " Please , " she said , still holding out the cap . At last he sighed and jammed the cap over his dark hair . She had to suppress a smile ; he did look dorky . He had already started down the hallway when she called out : " Good-bye kiss ? " With a look of exasperation , he turned to give her the barest peck on the cheek , and then he was out of the door . No hugs anymore , she thought ruefully as she stood at the window and watched him trudge toward the road . It 's all grunts and shrugs and awkward silences . He stopped beneath the maple tree at the end of the driveway , pulled off the cap , and stood with his hands in his pockets , shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin gray sweatshirt against a thirty-seven-degree morning . It was cool to be cold . She had to resist the urge to run outside and bundle him into a coat . Claire waited until the school bus appeared . She watched her son climb aboard without a backward glance , saw his silhouette move down the aisle and take a seat beside another student  --  a girl . Who is that girl ? she wondered . I do n't know the names of my son 's friends anymore . I 've shrunk to just a small corner of his universe . She knew this was supposed to happen , the pulling away , the child 's struggle for independence , but she was not prepared for it . The transformation had occurred suddenly , as though a sweet boy had walked out of the house one day , and a stranger had walked back in . You 're all I have left of Peter . I 'm not ready to lose you as well . The bus rumbled away . Claire returned to the kitchen and sat down to her cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a home still in mourning . She sighed and unrolled the weekly Tranquility Gazette . HEALTHY DEER HERD PROMISES BOUNTIFUL HARVEST , announced the front page . The hunt was on . Thirty days to bag your deer . Outside , another gunshot echoed in the woods . She turned the page to the police blotter . There was no mention yet of last night 's Halloween disturbance , or of the seven rowdy teenagers who 'd been arrested for taking their annual trick-or-treating too far . But there , buried among the reports of lost dogs and stolen firewood , was her name , under VIOLATIONS : " Claire Elliot , age forty , operating vehicle with expired safety sticker . " She still had n't brought the Subaru in for its safety inspection ; today she 'd have to drive the truck instead , just to avoid getting another citation . Irritably she flipped to the next page and was scanning the day 's weather forecast  --  cold and windy , high in the thirties , low in the twenties  --  when the telephone rang . She rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elliot ? This is Rachel Sorkin out on Toddy Point Road . I 've got something of an emergency out here . Elwyn just shot himself . " " What ? " " You know , that idiot Elwyn Clyde . He came trespassing on my property , chasing after some poor deer . Killed it too  --  a beautiful doe , right in my front yard . These stupid men and their stupid guns . " " What about Elwyn ? " " Oh , he tripped and shot his own foot . Serves him right . " " He should go straight to the hospital . " " Well you see , that 's the problem . He does n't want to go to the hospital , and he wo n't let me call an ambulance . He wants me to drive him and the deer home . Well , I 'm not going to . So what should I do with him ? " " How badly is he bleeding ? " She heard Rachel call out : " Hey , Elwyn ? Elwyn ! Are you bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He says he 's fine . He just wants a ride home . But I 'm not taking him , and I 'm certainly not taking the deer . " Claire sighed . " I guess I can drive over and take a look . You 're on Toddy Point Road ? " " About a mile past the Boulders . My name 's on the mail box . " The mist was starting to lift as Claire turned her pickup truck onto Toddy Point Road . Through stands of white pine , she caught glimpses of Locust Lake , the fog rising like steam . Already beams of sunlight were breaking through , splashing gold onto the rippling water . Across the lake , just visible through fingers of mist , was the north shore with its summer cottages , most of them boarded up for the season , their wealthy owners gone home to Boston or New York . On the south shore , where Claire now drove , were the more modest homes , some of them little more than two-room shacks tucked in among the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite stones where the local teenagers gathered to swim in the summertime , and spotted the mailbox with the name Sorkin . A bumpy dirt road brought her to the house . It was a strange and whimsical structure , rooms added haphazardly , corners jutting out in unexpected places . Rising above it all , like the tip of a crystal breaking through the roof , was a glassed-in belfry . An eccentric woman would have an eccentric house , and Rachel Sorkin was one of Tranquility 's odd birds , a striking , black-haired woman who strode once a week into town , swathed in a purple hooded cape . This looked like a house in which a caped woman might reside . By the front steps , next to a neatly tended herb garden , lay the dead deer . Claire climbed out of her truck . At once two dogs bounded out of the woods and barred her way , barking and growling . Guarding the kill , she realized . Rachel came out of the house and yelled at the dogs : " Get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She grabbed a broom from the porch and came tearing down the steps , long black hair flying , the broom thrust forward like a lance . The dogs backed away . " Ha ! Cowards , " said Rachel , lunging at them with the broom . They retreated toward the woods . " Hey , you leave my dogs alone ! " shouted Elwyn Clyde , who had limped out onto the porch . Elwyn was a prime example of an evolutionary dead end : a fifty-year-old lump bundled in flannel , and doomed to eternal bachelorhood . " They 're not hurtin ' nothin ' . They 're just watchin ' after my deer . " " Elwyn , I got news for you . You killed this poor creature on my property . So she 's mine . " " What you gon na do with a deer ? Blasted vegetarian ! " Claire cut in : " How 's the foot , Elwyn ? " He looked it Claire and blinked , as though surprised to see her . " I tripped , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound is always a big deal . May I take a look at it ? " " Ca n't pay you ... " He paused , one scraggly eyebrow lifting as a sly thought occurred . " ' Less you want some venison . " " I just want to make sure you 're not bleeding to death . We can settle up some other time . Can I look at your foot ? " " If you really want to , " he said , and limped back into the house . " This should be a treat , " said Rachel . It was warm inside the kitchen . Rachel threw a birch log into the wood stove , and sweet smoke puffed out as she dropped the cast iron lid back in place . " Let 's see the foot , " said Claire . Elwyn hobbled over to a chair , leaving smears of blood on the floor . He had his sock on , and there was it jagged hole at the top , near the big toe , as though a rat had chewed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Not worth all this fuss , if you ask me . " Claire knelt clown and peeled off the sock . It came away slowly , the wool matted to his foot not by blood but by sweat and dead skin . " Oh God , " said Rachel , cupping her hand over her nose . " Do n't you ever change your socks , Elwyn ? " The bullet had passed through the fleshy web between the first and second toe . Claire found the exit wound underneath the foot . There was only a little blood oozing out now . Trying not to gag on the smell , she tested movement of all the toes , and determined that no nerves had been damaged . " You 'll have to clean it and change the bandages every day , " she said . " And you need a tetanus shot , Elwyn . " " Oh , I got one of them already . " " When ? " " Last year , from ol ' Doc Pomeroy After I shot myself . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through my other foot . ' Twere n't a big deal . " Dr. Pomeroy had died back in January , and Claire had acquired all his old medical records when she 'd bought the practice from his estate eight months ago . She could check Elwyn 's file and confirm the date of his last tetanus shot . " I guess it 's up to me to clean that foot , " said Rachel . Claire took out a small bottle of Betadine from her medical bag and handed it to her . " Add that to a warm bucket of water . Let him soak in it for a while . " " Oh , I can do that myself , " said Elwyn , and got up . " Then we might as well just amputate right now ! " snapped Rachel . " Sit down , Elwyn . " " Gee , " he said , and sat down . Claire left a few packets of bandages and gauze wrappings on the table . " Elwyn , you come into my office next week , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got too much to do  --  " " If you do n't come in , I 'll have to hunt you down like a dog . " He blinked at her in surprise . " Yes , ma'am , " he said meekly . Suppressing a smile , Claire picked up her medical bag and walked out of the house . The two dogs were in the front yard again , fighting over a filthy bone . As Claire came down the steps , they both spun around to stare at her . The black one trotted forward and growled . " Shoo , " Claire said , but the dog refused to back down . It took another few steps forward , teeth bared . The tan dog , spotting opportunity , snatched the bone in its teeth and began dragging away the prize . It got halfway across the yard before the black dog suddenly noticed the thief and streaked back into the fight . Yelping and growling , they thrashed around the yard in a tangle of black and tan . The bone lay , forgotten , beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just sliding in behind the steering wheel when the image registered in her brain . She looked down at the ground , at the bone . It was less than a foot long , and stained a rusty brown with dirt . One end had broken off , leaving jagged splinters . The other end was intact , the bony landmarks recognizable . It was a femur . And it was human . Ten miles out of town , Tranquility Police Chief Lincoln Kelly finally caught up with his wife . She was doing about fifty in a stolen Chevy , weaving left and right , the loose tailpipe kicking up sparks every time she hit a dip in the road . " Man oh man , " said Floyd Spear , sitting beside Lincoln in the cruiser . " Doreen got her snookerful today . " " I 've been on the road all morning , " said Lincoln . " Did n't get a chance to check up on her . " He turned on the siren , hoping that would induce Doreen to slow down . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Want me to call for backup ? " Backup meant Hank Dorr , the only other officer on patrol duty that morning . " No , " said Lincoln . " Let 's see if we ca n't talk her into pulling over . " " At sixty miles an hour ? " " Get on the bullhorn . " Floyd picked up the mike and his voice boomed out over the speaker : " Hey , Doreen , pull over ! C'm on , Sweetheart , you 're gon na hurt someone ! " The Chevy just kept dipping and weaving . " We could wait till she runs out of gas , " Floyd suggested . " Keep talking to her . " Floyd tried the mike again . " Doreen , Lincoln 's here ! C'm on , Sweetheart , pull over ! He wants ta ' pologize ! " I want to what ? " " Pull over , Doreen , and he 'll tell you himself ! " " What in hell are you talking about ? " said Lincoln . " Women always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't do anything ! " Up ahead , the Chevy 's brake lights suddenly lit up . " See ? " said Floyd as the Chevy rolled to a stop at the side of the road . Lincoln pulled up behind it and climbed out of the cruiser . Doreen sat hunched behind the steering wheel , her red hair wild and tangled , her hands shaking . Lincoln opened the door , reached over his wife 's lap , and removed the car keys . " Doreen , " he said wearily , " you got ta come back to the station . " " When are you coming home , Lincoln ? " she asked . " We 'll talk about that later . Come on , Honey , let 's get in the cruiser . " He reached for her elbow but she shook him off and slapped his hand for good measure . " I just want to know when you 're coming home , " she said . " We 've talked about this and talked about this . " " You 're still married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And there 's just no point in talking about it any more . " Again he took her elbow . He already had her out of the Chevy when she hauled off and slugged him in the jaw . He staggered back a few steps , his whole head ringing . " Hey ! " said Floyd , grabbing Doreen 's arms . " Hey now , you do n't wan na go doing that ! " " Lemme go ! " screeched Doreen . She broke out of Floyd 's grasp and took another swing at her husband . This time Lincoln ducked , which only made his wife madder . She got in one more swing before Lincoln and Floyd managed to get her arms secured . " I hate to do this , " said Lincoln . " But you 're just not being reasonable today . " He snapped the handcuffs on her wrists . She spat at him . He wiped his sleeve across his face , then patiently guided his wife into the backseat of the cruiser . " Oh man , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to book her . " " I know . " Lincoln sighed and slid in behind the wheel . " You ca n't divorce me , Lincoln Kelly ! " said Doreen . " You promised to love and cherish ! " " I did n't know about the bottle , " said Lincoln , and he turned the car around . They drove at a leisurely speed toward town , Doreen cussing a purple streak the whole time . It was the drinking that did it ; it seemed to pop the cork off her bottle of demons . Two years ago , Lincoln had moved out of their house . He figured he 'd given the marriage his best effort and ten years of his life . He was n't by nature a quitter , but the despair had finally gotten to him . That and the sense that , at forty-five , his life was racing by , joyless and unfruitful . He wished he could do right by Doreen , wished that he could recapture some of that old affection he 'd felt for her early on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sober , not bubbling over with anger as she was now . Sometimes he 'd search his own heart for whatever trace of love might still linger , some small spark among the ashes , but there was nothing left . The ashes were cold . And he was tired . He had tried to stand by her , but Doreen could n't even see clear to help herself . Every few months , when her rage boiled up , she 'd spend the day drinking . Then she 'd " borrow " someone 's car and go for one of her famous high-speed drives . People in town knew to stay off the roads when Doreen Kelly got behind the wheel . Back at the Tranquility police station , Lincoln let Floyd do the booking and locking up . Through the two closed doors leading to the cell , he could hear Doreen yelling for a lawyer . He supposed he should call one for her , though no one in Tranquility wanted to take her on . Even down south as far as Bangor , she 'd worn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Rolodex , trolling for a lawyer 's name . Someone he had n't called in a while . Someone who did n't mind being cussed out by a client . It was all too much , too early in the morning . He shoved away the Rolodex and ran his hand through his hair . Doreen was still yelling in the back room . This would all be reported in that nosy Gazette , and then the Bangor and Portland papers would pick it up because the whole damn state of Maine thought it was funny and so very quaint . Tranquility police chief arrests own wife . Again . He reached for the telephone and was dialing the number for Tom Wiley , attorney at law , when he heard a knock at his door . Glancing up , he saw Claire Elliot walk into his office , and he hung up . " Hey , Claire , " he said . " Got your safety sticker yet ? " " I 'm still working on it . But I 'm not here about my car . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty bone down on his desk . " What 's this ? " " It 's a femur , Lincoln . " " What ? " " A thigh bone . I think it 's human . " He stared at the dirt-encrusted bone . One end was splintered off , and the shaft showed the gnawings of animal teeth . " Where did you find this ? " " Rachel Sorkin 's place . " " How did Rachel get it ? " " Elwyn Clyde 's dogs dragged it into her yard . She does n't know where it came from . I was over there this morning , after Elwyn shot himself in the foot . " " Again ? " He rolled his eyes and they both laughed . If every village had an idiot , then Tranquility 's would be Elwyn . " He 's okay , " she said . " But I guess a gunshot wound should be reported . " " Consider it done . I already have a folder for Elwyn and his gunshot wounds . " He gestured to a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sure it 's human ? " She sat down . Though they were looking directly at each other , he felt a barrier of reserve between them that was almost physical . He had sensed it the first time they 'd met , soon after she 'd moved to town , when she had attended to a prisoner suffering from abdominal pain in Tranquility 's three-cell jail . Lincoln had been curious about her from the start . Where was her husband ? Why was she alone raising her son ? But he had not felt comfortable asking her personal questions , and she did not seem to invite such intrusion . Pleasant but intensely private , she seemed reluctant to let anyone get too close to her , which was a shame . She was a pretty woman , short but sturdy , with luminous dark eyes and a mass of curly brown hair just starting to show the first strands of silver . She leaned forward , her hands resting on his desk . " I 'm not an expert or anything , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could come from . Judging by the size , it looks like a child 's . " " Did you see any other bones around ? " Rachel and I searched the yard , but we did n't find any . The dogs could 've picked this up anywhere in the woods . You 'll have to search the whole area . " " Could be from an old Indian burial . " " Possibly . But does n't it still have to go to the medical examiner ? " Suddenly she turned , her head cocked . " What 's all that commotion ? " Lincoln flushed . Doreen was shouting in her cell again , letting fly a fresh torrent of abuse . " Damn you , Lincoln ! You jerk ! You liar ! Damn you to hell ! " " It sounds like somebody does n't like you very much , " said Claire . He sighed and pressed his hand to his forehead . " My wife . " Claire 's gaze softened to a look of sympathy . It was apparent she knew about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , " she said . " Hey , loser ! " Doreen yelled . " You got no right to treat me like this ! " With deliberate effort , he redirected his attention to the thigh bone . " How old was the victim , do you think ? " She picked up the femur and turned it over in her hands . For a moment she held it with quiet reverence , fully aware that this broken length of bone had once supported a laughing , running child . " Young , " she murmured . " I would guess under ten years old . " She lay it on the desk and stared down in silence . " We have n't had any missing children reported recently , " he said . " The area 's been settled for hundreds of years , and old bones are always turning up . A century ago , it was n't all that unusual to die young . " She was frowning . " I do n't think this child died from natural causes , " she said softly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to turn on his desk lamp , and held the bone close to the light . " There , " she said . " It 's so crusted over , you can barely see it through the dirt . " He reached in his pocket for his glasses  --  another reminder of the years ' passage , of his youth slipping away . Bending closer , he tried to see what she was pointing at . Only when she 'd scraped away a clot of dirt with her fingernail did he see the wedge-shaped gash . It was the mark of a hatchet.
