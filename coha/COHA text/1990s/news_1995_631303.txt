<p> Makeup artist Sam Fine has the kind of job most people would kill for . <p> He travels around the world with entertainers like Patti LaBelle and Vanessa Williams . <p> He hears the secrets of supermodels like Veronica Webb , Tyra Banks and Naomi Campbell . <p> He creates phat video looks for singers like Mary J. Blige , Oleta Adams and teen sensation Brandy . <p> And his magical fingers have touched the entrepreneurial faces of Oprah Winfrey and cosmetics company founder Iman . <p> Fine , a born-and-bred Chicagoan who turns 26 Sunday , sure has progressed since his days at the South Side 's Percy Julian High School . He 's one of the nation 's most in-demand beauty enhancers , practically on-call for some of America 's most glamorous women . His going rate for services rendered is $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 per day . But despite the moneyed world he operates in , Fine retains that unassuming , Midwestern ease . He schleps around Manhattan in his baseball caps and Prada backpack , just a young brother making an honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Face is a canvas <p> The youngest child of four  --  and the only son  --  in his family , Fine grew up in the Far South Side neighborhood of Maple Park , watching his mom and sisters playing with makeup and styling their hair . The process fascinated him , and prompted young Sam 's interest in drawing and art . While studying art at Julian , Fine won awards for his work . He spent one high school summer studying at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago , planning to be a fashion illustrator after school . <p> But , says Fine , " it was n't long before I knew that New York was the only place to experience fashion . " So after graduation , he packed his bags and got a job selling Naomi Sims cosmetics for $ 12 an hour at Manhattan 's Abraham &; Straus department store . " I figured , ' If I 'm going to make mistakes or take a chance , the time to do it is when you 're young . ' I knew that college would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me enjoying my life . " <p> And he says that behind-the-counter job prepared him for the hectic life that he now leads . " I call that in-store experience the real school of beauty , " says Fine . " It 's an initiation . You 're not dealing with 20-year-olds all the time . " And his art training fit right in , as he just " took the two-dimensional form and turned it into the three-dimensional . The face is a canvas for me . " <p> A series of breaks  --  thanks to top New York makeup artists Fran Cooper and Kevyn Aucoin and supermodels Campbell and Webb  --  launched young Fine into fashion 's inner circle . Before long , he was sculpting faces backstage at designer runway shows . From there , top mannequins started requesting his services on editorial photo shoots . And he impressed Webb enough that once she signed a deal with Revlon 's ethnic ColorStyle campaign , she insisted he make her up for all photo shoots . And now , he 's a full-fledged Revlon spokesman , hitting the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Just because he 's working with The Big Folks these days and not department store shoppers , do n't think Fine is any less sensitive . If anything , he says , it 's tougher working with nearly perfect faces because their " flaws " seem more magnified than those of average-looking women . But it 's all in the approach , says Fine . <p> " Everybody 's insecure in their own way , " he says . " You compromise . They trust me to bring the new trends to them . They look for you to be a visionnaire  --  that is your job . <p> " I always tell people , ' I wo n't do what I do n't think is right , ' but I always put it in a therapeutic ( way ) . They know you 're too concerned for them to let them go out looking wrong . " <p> As Webb says , " Let me tell you  --  the people who can end your career are the hair and makeup people . Sam makes me feel comfortable transforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hated makeup before working with Fine . But " phase by phase , he would show me what the makeup was doing . I do n't really like doing it myself . I 'd rather have Sam do it or go bare-faced . " <p> Groupie of the gorgeous <p> After four years in the business , Fine still considers himself a " groupie " of the gorgeous girls he makes even more so . But he manages to keep himself grounded . " The more that you hang around these people called ' celebrities , ' " says Fine , " the more you realize they 're just regular people with a great gift of beauty , voice and personality . And they admire your gift , so there 's that real respect . <p> " You 're more than just a makeup artist  --  you 're a psychiatrist , a personal secretary . These girls have so much respect for what I do , and that is part of the love . You become friends . " <p> And that 's no small feat in the often-shallow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does n't make them confidantes . Fine radiates an effortless , known-you-forever charm that 's contagious . And conversely , he makes himself so indispensable to his clients that his time is rarely his own . <p> " People are n't devoted to you just because you 're good , " says Fine . " And for that kind of loyalty  --  I 'm a Scorpio , so I 'm very loyal  --  you have to give it back . " <p> That 's the main misconception the friends and family back home in Chicago have of his jet-set lifestyle  --  that it 's all glamor and fancy parties and big bucks . But , says Fine , " they do n't see the commitment you have to these celebrities . " He 's flown to Philadelphia at 3 a.m. to make over Patti LaBelle before her " Oprah Winfrey Show " gig , and flown back to New York for an all-day booking . <p> " Nobody sees me at the airport at 1 a.m. , alone , " he says . " Travel is not a vacation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance benefits or retirement plan . And every day that I have off that I do n't work , I do n't get paid . You have to be a hustler . You are the CEO of your own company . " <p> But all that aside , " I wo n't ever for one minute say I do n't love what I 'm doing . I 'm doing what I enjoy , and I 'm able to make a good living . As long as it 's fun , I 'm never going to stop . " <p> Like your best girlfriend <p> While Sam Fine is getting paid and having a ball , he has n't forgotten about those up-and-comers who are n't making those well-placed connections . He 's one of a few minorities in real positions of behind-the-scenes authority ; in the fashion world. ; So when he brings assistants to a runway show or photo shoot , he tries to bring people of color  --  or at least an integrated staff . <p> " It 's nice to know you can bring other people along and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , too , ' " says Fine . " Talent always rises , but you 've got to have the opportunity . There needs to be that door opened for the people who are n't as fortunate . You do n't have power unless you are the one making the changes . " <p> That 's why , when Veronica Webb became one of the first black models signed to a mainstream cosmetics contract ( Iman was the first , back in the ' 70s , with Revlon 's short-lived " Polished Embers " ethnic line ) , she chose to bring Fine along for the ride . <p> " They gave me the power to hire other black people and bring them into a market they had n't had access to , " says Webb . And in the three years Fine has worked with Revlon , he 's also " crossed over , " promoting the mass-market firm 's Age Defying and ColorStay makeup , as well . <p> The business " is also changing because you 're seeing more ethnicity in fashion , " says Fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races and forms of beauty , so it 's more acceptable that you bring ( minorities ) in . " <p> But for Webb and Tyra Banks and Patti LaBelle , race has nothing to with it . They see Sam Fine as the best makeup artist money can buy . And these women , who are used to having what they want , have decided they want him . <p> " Sam is like your full-service provider , " adds Webb . " It says a lot about Sam that he can make us all happy . He gets in your business like he 's your best girlfriend . " <p> " And they need it sometimes , too , " he counters . <p> " And do n't let Sam see you out there with your makeup looking all wrong . Girrrl . " <p> " You just try and try and try to be the best person you can be , " he says . " If you give , it all comes back to you . If I stretch myself out , I always get it back @ @
