The number of people choosing cremation has increased significantly during the past few years , as Americans rethink the notion of what constitutes a loving final memorial . <p> " As to ressurection , that must be accomplished by a miracle , and it is easy to the Being who has it in His power to perform such a miracle to form again the ashes of the dead . " <p> When Napoleon said that in 1816 , he was discounting the fear of some in his day that once a body was cremated , one could pretty much forget about it ever rising from the dead . <p> In years past , cremation has been associated with some serious issues , ecclesiastical and otherwise . There were those  --  the early persecutors of the Christians , for example  --  who used it as a kind of final insult , to mock their victims expectations of a life beyond death . And the crematoriums of the Nazi death camps obviously assisted in the terrible goal of absolute destruction , not only in fact but also in memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large groups of people , acceptance of cremation as an alternative to burial has been slow , even while for many others ( notably , practitioners of the Hindureligion ) it has represented a desirable and necessary ritual designed to speed the soul on its final journey . <p> But time and new issues ( such as concern over land use ) are having their effect , and notions of what constitutes a loving final memorial are becoming more flexible . <p> Jack Springer , executive director of the Cremation Association of North America ( CANA ) , agrees that acceptance of cremation is growing . According to CANA 's figures , cremation accounted for 18 1/2 percent of all final arrangements made in 1992 , compared with only 4 1/2 percent in 1991 . Springer predicts that the figure will reach 34 percent by 2010 . <p> A few states already are way beyond that point : For the past couple of years in California , more than 40 percent of all deaths have been followed by cremation , and Nevada passed 60 percent in 1991 . <p> In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably the best known is the Neptune Society , founded in California in the ' 70s primarily to assist families in making what then was an unpopular choice and to provide them with a lower-cost alternative to an expensive ground burial . <p> Since that time , the society has taken on more of the attributes of a business ; it operates as a number of separate franchises , many of which have their own crematoriums . <p> Cost is an undeniable factor in the expanding popularity of cremation . In Washington , the price of the most basic package , called a direct cremation , averages between $575 and $775 . That includes removal of the body , preparation of the death certificate , cremation , and return of the remains in an urn to the family . Such an arrangement can be financially appealing when funeral costs for the nation as a whole ( cemetery plot not included ) average between $3,000 and $4,000 . <p> The very simplicity , that is a virtue to some leads others to view cremation as somewhat cold and emotion-less . One woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's expressed wish for cremation , because they did n't want to be denied the consolation of a viewing following her sudden death . <p> In fact , cremation does not preclude the possibility of a dignified memorialization , including a viewing  --  or even a religious service . <p> Many funeral directors make rental caskets available for this purpose and will work with the family to arrange a service they would like , either before or after cremation takes place . The Catholic church permits a funeral rite with the body present even though cremation is planned , and also a Mass for the deceased with the body absent . It does not , however  --  at least within the United States  --  allow the cremated remains to be a part of the service . <p> Because of the obvious finality of cremation , survivors want to be assured that every precaution is taken to guard against the misidentification of remains . For this reason , some states specify detailed requirements for the identification of a body prior to cremation . Reputable funeral homes and crematoriums scrupulously abide by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for husbands and wives were common and routinely provided for . Now , with partner shifts occurring more frequently and later in life , a surviving spouse may be left out in the cold . For these people , cremation with the remains placed in the other 's grave can be a solution . This is akin to , but somewhat easier to arrange than , the practice known as double-depth interment , or using the same plot for two burials , one below the other . <p> Considerable latitude is available to families when it comes to disposal of cremation remains , or cremains , as they are known in the industry . ( Although commonly referred to as ashes , cremains  --  which contain a good proportion of pulverized bone fragments-actually are much more substantial than ashes . ) <p> There is the matter of a container . Urns are available , but not required . " People might bring in a favorite Oriental vase , " says Bart Yates , a director at the Lee Funeral Home in Clinton , Maryland . " We would just recommend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for scattering or , once we make sure that 's what they want , seal it up permanently . " <p> Sealed urns or other containers can be interred , subject to a cemetery 's size requirements , or placed in one of the niches of a columbarium , which is a special structure built to house cremation remains . ( The name derives from the similarity in appearance between the rows of niches and the nesting places of doves . ) <p> Scattering can be done wherever the heart found its home , and in that lies its appeal . Many people specify a beloved location ; others are drawn to the romance and symbolism of water . Funeral homes generally will help clients with either choice . And for those so inclined , the Central California Neptune Society offers the option of a private boat accommodating up to 20 people , complete with captain , flowers , and hors d'oeuvres for a private scattering at sea . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : " This was my brother 's way of letting them know of the serenity he experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : A wide range of attractive urns are now available , which can either be interred or placed in a columbarium . State-by-State Cremation Rate TABLE <p> No stats available for D.C. , N.D. , or Wyo . <p> Source : Cremation Association of North America ( 12/13/93 ) <p> By Joanne Leonard <p> MY BROTHER 'S ASHES <p> At first , the thought of cremation , which had never occurred to me , seemed so abrupt and final . I was consoled by the fact that the Church approved this method . However , even though we had the usual wake and Mass at the mortuary , there was no sense of finality as I left . Also , the idea of burning the body to ashes was torturing my innermost being . <p> My brother 's daughter spared me the details until after the fact . What she then shared with me helped me accept the notion of cremation and brought peace to my heart and soul . <p> My brother requested cremation to make sure there would be enough insurance money to cover funeral expenses . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he surprised us by having all the plans made and his obituary written . <p> He told his daughter that he wanted his remains cremated and scattered in the Ohio River to be with the catfish by the twin bridges connecting Evansville , Indiana , and Henderson , Kentucky . This was one of his favorite fishing spots . <p> My niece 's description of fulfilling his last wishes has changed my opinion about cremation . Two boats with six family members and friends went to his old fishing spot . What started as an emotional boat ride into a quiet sunset with gentle , calm waters enabled everyone to experience tranquillity , calmness , and peace . Everyone felt that this was my brother 's way of letting them know of the serenity he experienced here during his lifetime . The urn containing his ashes sought safety in the deepest part of the Ohio River , where his favorite catfish went for their refuge . Now , the thought of cremating a loved one 's remains seems more acceptable than the thought of those remains slowly returning to dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jean Hurt Having experienced the burial of both parents , two sisters , and a brother with a traditional Roman Catholic funeral , I was faced with a new idea of burial for the last family member . After my brother had chosen cremation , I was faced with adjusting my traditional , comforting way of dealing with death and burial . <p>
