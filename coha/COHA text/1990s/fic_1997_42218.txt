He was such a funny , sweet-tempered , jolly old motor bus , Number 99 was . He was so very wide and so very steady , and his bright paint always looked so fresh and shiny that you loved the first glimpse you had of him . He never pretended not to see people when they wanted him to stop at a corner . He would n't have dreamed of such a thing ! He always stopped and waited patiently till they got on with both feet . He never skidded sideways on slippery days , as some of the younger buses liked to do . He went rumbling straight along and never broke down . Everybody liked Number 99 ; and Number 99 liked everybody , from the tiny little babies who looked so surprised to be there , to the old , old men who always carried their canes and their white whiskers with them . But one morning Number 99 started out , and he did n't feel like himself at all ! It was a lovely , cold , snowy morning , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft gray sky . And everybody seemed so happy , with bundles and holly and twinkles in their arms and buttonholes and faces . There were round green wreaths and bright red ribbons on doors and bells jingling down the streets . The shop windows were packed with scarlet and green and gold , and there was a smell of pine trees in the air which made Number 99 feel like a little play bus again , somehow . Why do If eel like that ? he wondered . " It smells like-like Christmas trees ! " he exclaimed aloud . And just then a little boy 's voice said , " It will be a snowy Christmas tomorrow , Daddy ! " " Why , " said Number 99 to himself , " it is the day before Christmas ! " Now , Number 99 always worked harder at Christmas time than any other time . Everybody in the world was scurrying around then , shopping at the last minute , losing their packages , and having to go back again . They were going to see their grandmothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( according to their age , you know ) , and carrying big parcels with exciting ends sticking out , a doll 's foot or a bicycle handle or a long scarlet candle . Number 99 had very heavy loads . But he adored Christmas time just the same . And best of all he liked the day before Christmas . It seemed the most festive , the most adventurous , and the fullest of delightful secrets of all the days ! But this particular day before Christmas , as I said , Number 99 felt very odd . He had never felt just this way before in his whole life ! Somehow he did n't want to carry everybody back and forth to their merry Christmases . He wanted to have a day before Christmas " himself ! All at once , there in the middle of the street , he jumped up in the air with all four wheels . " I 'm going to have a Christmas myself , " he said . " I 'm going to run away ! " And without even thinking another minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snowy street just as fast as he could , and though there was a nice old lady waiting for him on the very first corner , he did n't even wink ! He just tossed his head , and laughed deep down in his radiator , and ran on faster than ever . He had never done that before ! He had always stopped for everybody . He was as bad as he could be , that day before Christmas . He ran all over town , and nobody could stop him ! He did n't pay the least attention to the traffic cops-he ran around just as he liked ! He got the street cars and trucks all mixed up by running down the wrong side of the street . He tooted his horn unexpectedly at people and made them jump out of their galoshes . He stood up on his back wheels and lunged at a young man with a flower in his coat and a beautiful new hat . And the young man ran and lost his flower and his hat . And Number 99 laughed till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had always been so kind ! He picked up a holly wreath with a bright red ribbon bow , and stuck it over one ear . Then he looked at himself in a big store window and pranced in the street , because he was so proud . Then he started off to run faster than ever ! Nobody could do one thing with him ! The policeman tried to stop him ; so did the chief of police ; so did the mayor . But Number 99 just laughed and blew his horn and ran around the corner . At last the mayor ordered all the police , especially the two on horseback , and all the fire departments , especially the hook and ladder , and the band , and the patrol wagon , to assemble in the square , by the big outdoor Christmas tree . " We 'll have to catch Number 99 and put him in jail , " the mayor said sternly . Number 99 decided , suddenly , that he had played long enough in the city So he ran away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good time he had out there ! For he was a city bus-he had never been in the country before-and he liked running along a country road in the snow , with no one else in sight , and his horn sounding so loudly in the still blue air . He felt more and more excited ! Then he found a steep hill , and he lay down on his back with his wheels in the air , and slid down it ! Then he rolled over and over in the fluffy snowdrifts , first taking off his holly wreath and hanging it up on a tree . Then he found a little river all covered with ice , and he slid up and down it for a long time . Then he went back to find his holly wreath , and he put it on , and started down the winding road again . After a while , he saw the high and mighty walls of a castle , up on a hilltop . He stopped a green wagon , which was ambling slowly by . " What is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " What ? " said the wagon . " That castle on the hill-what is it ? " Number 99 asked the green wagon a second time . " It 's a castle , " said the wagon . " Of course it is , old slab sides , " said Number 99 , laughing . " But who lives there ? " " The Lord of the Castle lives there , " said the wagon slowly , after a long silence . " All alone he lives , since his daughter married the piper , and he sent them away . " " I believe I 'll just run up and see him , " said the motor bus . " I 'll watch for you to come down , " said the green wagon . It gave a low , deep chuckle , and started slowly on again . Number 99 ran up the steep hill to the castle gates . He had to go so fast to get up the hill that he could n't stop and ran inside the gates . He ran on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Hall of State , and he shattered it to bits . Nothing was left but the gold frame , and it was hanging around Number 99 's neck ! The Lord of the Castle came rushing out from lunch with a blueberry muffin in his hand . Oh , how angry he was ! He threw the muffin violently at Number 99 , and he called to all his soldiers , " Arrest that motor bus ! " Number 99 ran round and round the Hall of State , and the soldiers ran after him , tripping on the crimson cord that hung from the mirror frame . But at last Number 99 crashed into a marble column accidentally-a muffin crumb had gotten in his eye-and he sat down with a thump . Then all the soldiers seized him ( he was so stunned by the crash that he could n't even wriggle ) and they threw him out of the castle gates and he rolled down the steep castle hill . <p> Number 99 heard a faint giggle as the green wagon passed slowly behind a hill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Lord of the Castle stood on the gray wall in his red cloak and shook his fist at Number 99 , who sat in the ditch and rubbed his forehead and straightened his holly wreath . " If you ever come back again , " said the Lord of the Castle , " I 'll have you chopped up in little pieces . Little pieces ! " The motor bus climbed stiffly out of the ditch and started off again . All at once he began to laugh . " I wish I could have seen myself falling down the hill ! " he said . By this time it was almost dark . It was very quiet along the country road , and the snow lay white on the hills , and the great silver Christmas star shone in the sky . " It 's Christmas Eve , " said the motor bus to himself softly , and suddenly all the mischief left his heart , and something else came into it . He looked up at the Christmas star again , shining in the dark , clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motor bus again , and he began to sing a Christmas carol . But he stopped soon , for he heard a real Christmas carol coming through the air . He followed the singing , and at last , just as it was really dark , he came to a little brown house , almost covered with snow . Round and round he prowled , till he found a window with the shade only half pulled down . Then he kneeled down on his front wheels and peeped through the window . There was a rosy fire in the fireplace of the little house , and sitting before it was the loveliest lady he had ever seen , with three little girls on one side of her , and three little boys on the other . And they were all singing Christmas carols . The motor bus liked listening to their songs . At last the lovely lady said , " Now , darlings , you must run away to bed . And remember , though tomorrow is Christmas Day , there wo n't be any Christmas presents . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , we wo n't mind , Mother , " said the oldest little boy sturdily . " We think you 're wonderful . You 've made enough money sewing to get our bread and milk , even though you do have to work all the time . " Number 99 looked , and indeed the lovely lady was sewing even then . " We all think the Christmas carols are a lovely Christmas present , " said the middle little boy . " Are you sure the Lord of the Castle wo n't send Christmas presents ? " asked the littlest boy in a wistful voice . " Of course , he wo n't , " said the oldest little girl . " He does n't know that Daddy had to go way off to the other side of the world to get money enough for us . " " I know how you can give us a Christmas present tomorrow , Mother , " said the littlest girl . You can tell us about the wonderful Christmases you had when you were the Lord of the Castle 's little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the lovely lady , laughing . But when all the children were asleep in bed , she sat by the fire and cried because there were no Christmas presents for them . Oh , the motor bus simply could n't bear to see the lady crying ! It hurt him somewhere inside . And when he thought of all the things the Lord of the Castle had , it made him so mad that his engine whirred faster and faster . Then , all at once , he had a wonderful idea ! It was such a good idea that Number 99 could hardly keep from sounding his horn . He could hardly keep his wheels still . But he patiently waited till the lady went to sleep , there by the fire . Then-he slipped around to the front of the house , and he pulled a strong rope out of the tool box , and he tied one end of it around the little brown house , and the other around his waist , and he began to pull the little brown house down the snowy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow , till they came to the castle hill . The bus had a dreadful time pulling the little brown house up that steep hill ! But at last he did . <p> Then he opened the castle gates gently , and he left the little brown house in the courtyard . He went on into the castle-only carefully this time , so that he would n't break anything-and into the banquet hall where the Lord of the Castle and all the soldiers were having a feast . " There 's that ridiculous motor bus , " shouted the Lord of the Castle angrily . " Did n't I tell him I 'd have him chopped up in little pieces if he ever came back ? " " Well , you can have me chopped up in little pieces , " said the motor bus bravely , though his windows shook at the thought . " But first I have something to show you . " So he led the Lord of the Castle out into the courtyard and showed him the little brown house , and the three little girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their mother asleep by the fire , and not a single Christmas present in the house . The Lord of the Castle wanted to cry , but he could n't , because he was Lord of the Castle . So he walked up and down the courtyard very fast , stamping his feet . Then he slapped the motor bus on the side . " You 're a good old bus , after all , " he said . " Thank you for bringing them up . " Then he called to his soldiers , and everyone hurried . In the morning , when the lady and the children woke up , it seemed unusually warm in the little brown house , which was most frightfully cold on winter mornings . And when they looked out a window , they seemed to see walls and banners instead of snow and fields ! It seemed strange . So as soon as they were dressed , they opened their door . The little brown house had been moved again in the night . It was inside the Hall of State , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the lady and the children walked out of the front door , there was a great fireplace with a huge fire roaring in it , and a stocking apiece hanging , crammed full ! In one corner was an enormous Christmas tree , green and silver and sparking , with playthings , and candy and nuts , and a Christmas tree should have hanging on it . And in the other corner was the motor bus , still with his holly wreath on , and Christmas tree ornaments all over him to make him look festive , and the biggest smile on his face that you ever did see ! And there was a lovely turkeycranberry-plum pudding smell coming around the corner ! And best of all , there was the Lord of the Castle , with open arms , in front of the fireplace ! The lovely lady laughed and cried and laughed again , and the Lord of the Castle hugged her and each little girl and each little boy . And then they opened their stockings , and then had breakfast , and then plucked gifts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was the nicest Christmas ever ! <p> Forever after the lady and her three little boys and three little girls lived with the Lord of the Castle , and when her husband , the piper , came back from the other side of the world , he lived there , too . And Number 99 ? Why , of course , he stayed ! They all loved him as hard as they could . He had a green wreath to wear every day , and a gold one for Sundays . And he asked them if they would call him Jimmy once in a while , and they did ! And he never had to carry anyone around unless he wanted to , except the Lord of the Castle when he went into town to call on the Mayor . And he liked that . The motor bus has been very happy ever since . But once in a while , when he gets tired of playing around the castle , he goes down into the city and pretends to be a regular hard-working bus . Maybe you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children rides , and he likes most especially of all to give them rides at Christmas time !
