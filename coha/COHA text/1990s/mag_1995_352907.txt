The news did n't surprise , but the forum sure did . Bob Dole has wanted to be President almost forever  --  this will be his third try  --  and an announcement was expected soon . But not last Friday night , and certainly not on David Letterman 's Late Show . But why not ? Richard Nixon said Sock it to me ' ' on Laugh-In in 1968 , and later appraised his cameo as a stroke that helped people see I was n't just that Tricky Dick , meanspirited son-of-a-bitch . ' ' So Dole took a page from the Nixon playbook , and for the same reason . If he feared that he 's seen as stiff and sardonic , still perceived as a hatchet man by those who recall his slash-and-burn campaign tactics as Gerald Ford 's 1976 vice-presidential running mate , well , then maybe he was right to use network TV 's hippest show to lighten his image . <P> And make it official  --  or informally official , as Dole put it . Though he had hinted broadly that he planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night on PBS , Dole 's more emphatic declaration on the highly rated Late Show  --  and his witty bantering with the host  --  was smart politics . Well , I 'm going to run . For President . In ' 96 , ' ' Dole said in his familiar growl . I thought about it a lot , ' ' the Senate majority leader added , and I think every country ought to have a President . ' ' The studio audience loved it . And loved it even more when Dole stumbled through a special version of the show 's patented Top Ten list . We 've cut everything 30% , so I 've got a Top Seven list , ' ' Dole said . The subject : how to balance the budget . No. 7 suggested that Bill Clinton 's speechwriters no longer be paid by the word . No. 1 was Arkansas ? Sell it . ' ' Introduced by Letterman as an actual American hero , ' ' Dole astutely ended his 10-minute gig by acknowledging a friend in the audience , Frank Carafa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life by dragging the gravely wounded Lieut . Dole across a World War II battlefield . The emotional power was diminished only slightly by a by-product of the show 's opening skit : Carafa , like the rest of the audience , was clutching a canned ham . <P> It was a far cry from the last time Dole began a presidential bid , in 1987 , with a stark , conventional announcement from his hometown of Russell , Kansas . With 54 weeks to go before the New Hampshire primary , the Republican contest for President is lifting off quickly  --  and shedding its excess baggage almost as fast . Last week it was Jack Kemp 's turn . The man who helped define Reaganism , the humane champion of free enterprise , decided not to run . Many in the party , ' ' he told recently , have moved further to the right than I feel comfortable with . What I believe in  --  that we should include everyone  --  is n't much in fashion .
