<p> The stooped figure was dimly outlined in the Senate hallway as a troop of Girl Scouts milled about at the Capitol one recent day . A Senate page followed their stares : " That 's Senator Thurmond . He 's that real old guy . " r The girls crowded around to meet America 's political grandfather . He shook every hand . " Glad ta see ya , " he told them . " A'mm Strom Thurmond . " <p> At 92 , James Strom Thurmond is old by anyone 's definition except his own . <p> He is a year away from becoming the oldest senator ever , and two years and two months from becoming the longest-serving senator in history . <p> And when most of his generation has retired or expired , Thurmond is readying to run for an eighth term in 1996 . <p> The political betting is that Thurmond might be asking for one term too many . A poll this year found that two-thirds of South Carolina voters think he should retire . His age is sure to count against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " seniority " has become a dirty word . <p> But no opponent has yet emerged , and Thurmond is doing everything he can to scare any off by staffing a campaign and raising money early . <p> A segregationist who learned to accommodate black voters , Thurmond is once again adjusting to the politics of the day . For one thing , he 's come out for term limits . <p> " I only plan to run one more time , " he said in an interview . " Just one more time . " <p> Embracing term limits is a reach for a man who has held elective office for six decades and whose life spans the modern era . <p> After all , Thurmond was born the year President Roosevelt ( Theodore , not Franklin ) persuaded Congress to build the Panama Canal . He was elected governor of South Carolina in the same year President Clinton was born . He has been in the Senate four years longer than its youngest member , 36-year-old Rick Santorum ( R-Pa. ) , has been alive . <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , but ( in running again ) he risks 60 years of success in politics , " said Charles W. Dunn , a Clemson University political scientist . <p> Thurmond has bucked the odds before , winning more often than he has lost . There was a failed Dixiecrat campaign for president in 1948 , then an insurgent write-in campaign that won him his Senate seat in 1954 and a party switch in 1964 that helped lead the South to the Republican Party . <p> That 's not to mention marrying two beauty queens half his age , siring four children in his 60s and sporting one of the all-time flashiest hair transplants . The color has gone from tangerine to burnt umber over the years , but still no hint of gray . <p> Now the final chapter has begun - Strom Thurmond 's last hurrah . Every slip-up gets noticed <p> When the Republicans took over the Senate this year , Thurmond got something he had long coveted - chairmanship of the Senate Armed Services Committee . But no sooner had he ascended than speculation bloomed about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a staff-supplied script . <p> Now , his every slip gets noticed . <p> Last month , for instance , Thurmond presided over a committee hearing featuring the Navy secretary , the Marine commandant and the chief of naval operations . They sat at the witness table , with speeches at the ready and a row of ramrod-straight aides looking on . <p> In his molasses mumble , Thurmond read a statement verbatim , stopped , and invited senators to begin their questions . He had forgotten to let the Navy brass speak until an aide jumped up to whisper in his ear . <p> Thirty-some years ago , when then-Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson faced the prospect of an aged chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , he finessed it . The story goes that he took Sen. Theodore Green of Rhode Island aside and convinced him to become chairman " emeritus . " Republican senators on Thurmond 's committee - how many remains unclear - tried the same " emeritus " maneuver with Thurmond but got nowhere . With the help of Majority Leader Bob Dole , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Thurmond says he is fit and the " revolt " was no more than the work of Sen. John Warner ( R-Va. ) , who would have become chairman in his place . Warner declined comment . <p> " I do n't think it was any serious effort , except on the part of one person who would be chairman if I got out , " Thurmond said . " I 'm not mentioning his name at all . " <p> So far , no senator has publicly questioned Thurmond 's capacity to run the committee . <p> " I know there was talk of it , " said Sen. James Exon ( D-Neb. ) , a member of the committee , " but Strom is fully capable of being chairman of the committee . " <p> Georgia 's Sen. Sam Nunn , the former Democratic chairman , said , " I think age effects us all . . . but I think on the big decisions that Strom is on top of them . " <p> One committee member said Thurmond is under pressure to relinquish the gavel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just this month , Sen. Dirk Kempthone , ( R-Idaho ) , a junior member , chaired a full committee hearing to receive testimony from Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary . An aide said Thurmond was too busy to preside . <p> Age is a joke in Washington <p> The senator can still stir a crowd , though , as he did one evening last month in a Washington ballroom full of Georgia members of the National Guard . <p> " I 've been here 40 years and enjoyed every minute of it , " Thurmond declared . " It 's taken my whole life . " <p> The reaction of John Griffin of Savannah was typical : " He can sure speak for a 92-year-old guy . He 's a reason I 'm against term limits . " <p> No one questions that Thurmond is a robust nonagenarian . He still does his morning exercises and swims laps once or twice a week . His handshake remains viselike . But he also is closely protected by his staff and cuts a lonely figure , particularly since the death two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit by a drunk driver in Columbia , S.C . Reporters are kept at bay , with interviews limited and even his public schedule guarded . <p> His age has become a Washington joke . <p> At the exclusive Gridiron Club dinner recently , a Washington lawyer wearing an orange wig sang " Old Man Thurmond " to the tune of " Ol Man River . " Thurmond was n't there to hear it because the dinner organizers would n't provide an extra ticket so an aide could sit with him . <p> Thurmond is separated from his second wife and lives in a two- bedroom condominium in Alexandria , Va . Friends say the job still consumes his life , although he travels less and almost never alone . <p> In addition to his committee chair , he is president pro tempore of the Senate , putting him third in presidential succession behind the vice president and House speaker . Asked whether he was prepared to assume the presidency , Thurmond said simply , " I do n't see why I would n't be . " <p> He dismisses as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He concedes that his hearing has dimmed but only " very little . " He has a hearing aid that he wo n't wear . <p> " On account of my age , I think they thought I needed a hearing aid , " he said , " but I just never have bothered to wear it . " <p> Such answers do n't surprise former Sen. George Smathers ( D-Fla. ) , 81 , who has known Thurmond for 40 years . " Strom thinks he 's as good as ever , as good as the day he came to the Senate , " he said . <p> GOP wo n't challenge icon <p> Thurmond is a political legend at home , a conservative who has risen above his distaste for government spending to bring the bacon back to South Carolina . His name is on half a dozen schools and college buildings , a dam and lake , a federal building , a city mall , a couple of military facilities , several streets and highways , and a biomedical research center . <p> But South Carolina political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of newcomers and its recent penchant for electing members of Congress who promise term limits make him vulnerable in 1996 . <p> " In his forty years in the Senate , Strom has got his toughest race , " said Lee Bandy , longtime columnist for Columbia 's newspaper , The State . " I 've noted that he has aged a lot in the last several years . He 's more stooped , shuffles along , needs to hold on to people more . " <p> Although no challenger has emerged , the politicians appear to be circling , especially in light of the poll results . But allies say the popular sentiment for retirement will fade as the election nears . <p> " They 'll turn around and vote for him , " longtime friend and Republican activist H.A . McClearen said . Still , McClearen thinks it is time for Thurmond to call it quits . <p> ' I really would not like to see him run , " he said , adding that he 'd never tell Thurmond so because " you do n't tell Strom anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment has circled the wagons against a primary challenge . <p> " I think there are too many of us who would close ranks against anyone who ran against him , " said former Gov . Carroll Campbell , who is widely viewed as waiting in the wings should Thurmond step aside . <p> Warren Tompkins , a Columbia political consultant and former Campbell aide , has been installed to guide the Thurmond re-election . <p> One prominent Republican , Secretary of State Jim Miles , has formed a senatorial campaign committee , but he insists it is for a 1998 challenge of Democratic Sen. Earnest Hollings , not Thurmond . <p> There are a number of potential Democratic opponents , including Secretary of Education Richard Riley , the former governor , and Rep. John Spratt , a conservative Democrat . Both deny plans to challenge Thurmond but admit they are being prodded by some Democratic leaders . <p> " Senator Thurmond 's support runs pretty deep and pretty wide , " Spratt said . " It 's difficult to know how people are going to respond to the age issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he doubts South Carolinians still feel the personal link to Thurmond that they did in previous decades . <p> " I see it in my students . That reverential awe is no longer there , " he said . " This is a golden opportunity for the Democrats . " <p> But Tompkins argued that seniority still has an appeal , particularly when it comes to bread-and-butter issues such as protecting economically important military bases . <p> " I do not anticipate that the people of South Carolina will vote against their own interests , " he said . Besides , Tompkins added , " The political Boot Hill in South Carolina is full of people who thought that Strom Thurmond had passed his prime . " What friends and associates say about the 92-year-old senator 's run for one last term " Senator Thurmond has found heaven in the United States Senate and he plans to spend eternity there . " - Harry Dent of Columbia , S.C. , former Thurmond aide and Nixon administration official <p> " He 's got nothing else . There 's just nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Nadine Cohodas , author of " Strom Thurmond &; The Politics of Southern Change " <p> " Part of the reason he wants to do it is probably because so many people are telling him he can't. " - James Cross , Thurmond archivist at Clemson University <p> " One of his goals is to be a senator at age 100. " - Joe Ellers , author of " Strom Thurmond : The Public Man " <p> " I suspect Strom would be a very unhappy man if he voluntarily retired , even more unhappy if he runs and is defeated . " - Sen. James Exon , ( D-Neb. ) , who , at 73 , has decided not to seek re-election <p> Chart : After 40 years , he 's for limit Sen. Strom Thurmond was interviewed recently by staff writer A.L . May . Here are some excerpts : Are you really for limiting the terms of senators or congressmen ? If the question comes up on limiting terms , I will vote for it . . . . I think we 'll lose some good people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might bring in new blood and it might be good for the country . You do n't find that somewhat inconsistent for someone who , if re-elected , could end up being the longest-serving senator in history ? Inconsistent ? I do n't think so . ( chuckling ) . . . Well , you see , I 've been here a long time and that statement is just made on my experience since I 've been here . Now I 'm in good shape , but a lot of people are not . In fact , most people my age are not in such good shape . I exercise , watch my diet and have good genes . Can you give me an idea of what you are doing now to keep fit ? Twenty minutes every morning I do calisthenics , push-ups , setups , twisting , bending and stretching . Ten minutes lying on my back lifting weights , and twenty to thirty minutes riding a stationary bicycle . Then I try to swim a half mile once or twice a week . You have made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do you do it ? Well , if you feel good , and you are rendering a good service , what else could you do that would give you satisfaction ? Play golf ? Lie on a beach ? Write a book ? What do you accomplish by playing golf ? I get my exercise otherwise . . . . I just get pleasure out of helping people . My motto is helping people .
