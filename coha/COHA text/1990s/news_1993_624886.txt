<p> BALTIMORE  --  Roberto Alomar has been on both sides during All-Star games , and he says there 's a simple explanation for the American League 's recent domination , which continued Tuesday night in a 9-3 win . <p> Talent . Alomar , who was an All-Star in 1990 for San Diego in the National League and has represented Toronto the last three years , believes there is more young talent in the American League . <p> " " The numbers speak for themselves , and we have the better numbers , " Alomar said . " " I do think the AL is a little bit better right now . There 's good players over there ( in the NL ) , but we have a lot of good young players . " <p> For the last six seasons , that 's been painfully obvious to the NL . The AL has won every game since 1988 and seven of the last eight All-Star games . In their six straight wins , the AL has outscored the NL 35-15 . In their last two wins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one team in consecutive All-Star games . <p> " " Now it 's six  --  and six is too many , " said Atlanta manager Bobby Cox . " " The guys were fired up , really talking about winning the last two days . I thought we had a great chance to win , but we just did n't . " <p> The American League had six extra-base hits , including two home runs . Minnesota 's Kirby Puckett , the game 's Most Valuable Player , hit a solo homer and had an RBI double . Alomar also had a solo homer . <p> In all , there were 10 extra-base hits and seven doubles , both of which tied All-Star Game records . But even though the NL took a 2-0 lead in the first inning , the AL once again pounded the NL . <p> " " I really ca n't explain it , " Puckett said of the AL domination . " " It 's a one-shot deal , one game . It 's not like we have to come out and play again tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just one game , not like we 're beating them six times in a week or something . <p> " " We have a lot of young talent , and we have a lot of pride in the clubhouse . The guys come here to win , and they make it known . They do n't come here to lose . " Players from the top two teams in the NL West hardly distinguished themselves . San Francisco 's John Burkett was the losing pitcher , allowing four hits and three runs in two-thirds of an inning when the AL broke a tie at 2 in the fifth . <p> Atlanta shortstop Jeff Blauser and right fielder David Justice made the only two errors of the game . Blauser 's error led to three unearned runs against teammates Steve Avery and John Smoltz . Smoltz threw two wild pitches that brought home runs . <p> " " We came out there strong , everybody felt confident , " said San Francisco left fielder Barry Bonds , who had two doubles . " " We really wanted to win this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those guys are powerhouses over there , and they 're tearing us up . " <p> With Philadelphia 's Terry Mulholland and California 's Mark Langston on the mound , two lefthanders started an All-Star Game for the sixth time in history and the first time since 1961 , when Whitey Ford met Warren Spahn . <p> Three batters into the game , the NL grabbed a 2-0 lead on third baseman Gary Sheffield 's home run . Sheffield , who started the season with San Diego and was traded to Florida in June , was the first player from a first-year expansion team to start an All-Star Game . <p> Sheffield 's quick homer was an omen . Mulholland retired the AL quietly in the first inning , but Puckett hit a solo homer to center field in the second inning . <p> Langston pitched around a single and walk in the second inning , starting a run of 10 straight batters retired by three AL pitchers . <p> The AL quickly tied the game against San Diego 's Andy Benes in the third inning . Alomar hit Benes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie the score at 2 <p> Seattle 's Randy Johnson followed Langston and pitched two shutout innings . In the third , Philadelphia 's John Kruk had an amusing at-bat . Johnson , who stands 6-10 and throws as hard as any pitcher in baseball , threw the first pitch about five feet over Kruk 's head . <p> Kruk grinned and got back in the box . He took one pitch and then swung wildly and missed two breaking balls from Johnson . As Kruk walked to his position at first base , Johnson crossed in front of him and winked at Kruk . <p> Only in an All-Star Game , where the competitive fires do n't burn as bright as in the regular season . <p> " " With the heat and humidity , the ball was very slippery , " Johnson said . " " Maybe you 'd call that a set-up pitch . I meant nothing by it . Kruk even joked about it , pretending he was going to bat righthanded . John has the type of personality , I think , that he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it . " <p> The AL drew a big reaction from the crowd of 48,147  --  the largest in the two-year history of Camden Yards  --  when they smacked San Francisco 's Burkett for three runs in the fifth inning to take a 5-2 lead . <p> Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez started the inning with an odd double . His line drive stuck in the padding on the left-field wall for a ground-rule double . After one out , Cleveland 's Albert Belle lined a single to right for the go-ahead run . Justice booted the ball for an error that allowed Belle to get to second . <p> Seattle 's Ken Griffey Jr . also singled to right to make it 4-2 , and he continued to second when Justice 's throw to the plate was too high to cut off and up the third-base line . One out later , Puckett 's double brought home Griffey and chased Burkett , the NL 's leading winner at 13-2 . <p> Atlanta 's Avery got out of that inning behind 5-2 . The NL got one of the runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the NL had runners on first and third with none out and got just one run on Barry Larkin 's sacrifice fly . Bonds ' second double of the game and a single by Sheffield set up the inning . <p> The AL put away the game in the sixth inning , and the Braves were to blame for the three runs . Shortstop Blauser , who had just entered the game , booted a two-out grounder . Avery gave up a double to Devon White to make it 6-2 and was replaced by teammate Smoltz . <p> He threw two wild pitches to bring home two runs , and put the AL on the way toward another blowout . <p> " " It 's getting a little old , " said San Diego right fielder Tony Gwynn . " " Every year we come here , and we leave disappointed . <p> It 's about time we snapped this streak .
