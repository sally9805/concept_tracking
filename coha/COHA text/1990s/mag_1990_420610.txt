Section : FUND WATCH News and performance <p> For many mutual fund investors , August 's financial tempest was uncomfort ably reminiscent of the even stormier month of October 1987 . While this year 's version lacked the climactic one-day panic of Black Monday , some categories of funds were clocked nearly as hard in the August sell-off as they were three years ago . In October 1987 , for example , growth funds plunged 23% on average ; this year they were down 17% from their high in mid-July to their late-August low . The comparable figures for small-company growth funds : a 27.5% loss in 1987 vs. a 20.5% drop this year . <p> As you might expect , though , some funds withstood the deluge better than others . The four traditional defensive fund categories discussed below  --  U.S. government bonds , asset-allocation , gold and total-return funds  --  all outperformed the average stock fund , which lost 16% . <p> Yet chasing such August champs now could make as little sense as buying an umbrella after you 've been drenched . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aftermath was that you should not let short-term setbacks distract you from your long-term goals . <p> Still , if last summer 's carnage convinced you that your risk tolerance is n't what it used to be , you might consider upping your exposure to Treasury bonds or trading in some of your more volatile equity funds for conservative total return funds . Keep in mind , though , that no fund is completely bulletproof . So before you dial your fund 's telephone switch number , examine the outlook for these safe havens , presented with the least risky categories first . <p> U.S. Treasury bond funds . In the 1987 crash , U.S. government bond funds topped all categories with a 3.8% gain for the month . In August , however , government funds fell by 1.9% on inflation fears . Still , unless war breaks out , a weakening economy should allow rates on long-term Treasuries , lately around 9% , to drop as much as a percentage point by the end of 1991 . That would translate to a total return of perhaps 20%  --  and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But not so fast . The period between now and then could be quite rocky , with rates on long-term Treasuries rising as high as 9.5% and the price of the bonds dropping by 4.5% or so . Your safer choice : funds that specialize in less rate-sensitive intermediate-term bonds , such as Vanguard Bond Market , which holds five- to 10-year government issues along with some high-grade corporates . <p> Asset-allocation funds . Funds that split your money among different asset categories  --  including stocks , bonds , cash and often real estate and gold  --  outperformed the average stock fund in the summer squall , losing 8% vs. the typical fund 's 16% . But while asset allocators have the right idea  --  diversification  --  they tend to be strictly sour-market stars . Most advisers recommend creating your own well-balanced portfolio by spreading your money among several top-performing funds of different types . For funds worth considering , see The MONEY 20 on page 62 . Such a multifund strategy can be impractical , however , if you have less than $5,000 or so to invest . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocators , the no-load USAA Cornerstone , up 98% in the five years to Sept 1 . <p> Total-return funds . These funds will take their knocks in any further stock market selloffs . But their high yields of 4.5% to 7%  --  the product of portfolios tilted toward high-dividend stocks and convertible bonds  --  should cushion the blow somewhat . From mid-July to late August , for example , the funds fell 11% compared with 17% for aggressive capital-appreciation funds . Over the past five years , moreover , several total-return funds have turned in performances worthy of much riskier funds . The August market crack thus provides a chance to pick up some top-shelf noloads at bargain prices . Selected American Shares , for example , up 85% over five years , could be had for 7.6% less in early September than the month before ; the estimable Lindner Dividend , up 66% , was going for 1.6% less . <p> Gold funds . Financial sages are divided on the defensive virtues of gold funds . The yellow metal is a traditional refuge in times of political tension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Persian Gulf crisis , rising 12% . By the end of the month , however , they had given back all their gains and then some , finishing down 1.5% . Still , an eruption of fighting in the Gulf  --  which would likely crunch most other kinds of funds  --  would probably stiffen demand for gold . As a result , you might choose to keep , say , 5% of your assets in a no-load metals fund such as Lexington Goldfund , up 6% in the past 12 months . Monthly results at a glance <p> Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait spelled trouble for mutual funds in August . For the average stock fund , it was the ugliest mouth since October ' 87 ; for bonds , the worst since the bond-bashing spring of that year . The only refuges were in money-market funds , whose yields remain unchanged , and in global bond funds , which managed to break even thanks to a failing dollar . TABLE WHERE TO KEEP DRY  --  MORE OR LESS  --  IN A MARKET STORM <p> If you think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider adding some defensive funds , such as the five below . But as the table shows , no fund holds up equally well in every bear market . Best advice : stay diversified and stick with a long-term strategy . TABLE <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> When the Persian Gulf crisis sent worldwide securities markets into a tailspin , the only fund category that did n't lose money was world income . The funds , which invest in fixed-income securities issued anywhere in the world , broke even for August , leaving them 11.7% ahead for the year . The average domestic bond fund , up 3.2% for the year , lost 1.9% for the month . <p> The group 's performance confirmed the wisdom of keeping 20% or so of your fixed-income portfolio in global bond funds . It 's true that the funds are more volatile than domestic bond funds because their net asset values fluctuate not only with interest rates but also with the value of the dollar . ( A weakening buck boosts the return of world bond funds because it makes their foreign holdings worth more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic funds , world-income funds can actually lower the risk of your overall portfolio . <p> Fidelity Global Bond ( no load ; 800-544-8888 ) and Paine Webber Master Global Income ( 5% back-end load ; 800-647-1568 ) are two of only 12 funds in the relatively new world-income category to have three-year records . And the two veterans are solid performers . For the three years to Sept. 1 , Fidelity Global rose 34% and Paine Webber 51% , compared with 26% for the Salomon Bros . World Government Bond index . Both funds invest primarily in government securities issued by major industrialized nations . But otherwise , the funds ' investment philosophies differ in important ways . <p> The main goal of the Paine Webber fund 's co-managers Nimrod Fachler , 37 , and Stuart Waugh , 35 , is to collect high , steady income . The fund currently yields an attractive 8.3% , thanks in part to an 18% weighting in bonds such as Australian , British and Spanish governments , which yield as much as 15% . <p> But Fachler and Waugh , who have piloted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not solely concerned with plumping up the fund 's yield . In a happily timed move , the pair raised Master Global 's cash level from 30% in May to about 60% in July , to protect the share price against anticipated weakness in the worldwide bond market . When the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait blasted foreign as well as domestic bonds , the Paine Webber portfolio held its ground ; a 2% decline in the dollar helped nudge the fund to a positive 1% return for August . <p> By contrast , Fidelity Global manager Judy Pagliuca , 34 , seeks a return that balances income with price appreciation , an approach reflected in the fund 's modest 4.2% yield . " We 're not focused exclusively on high income , " she says , " because we think capital may get eroded when you take risks to get higher yields . " ( That has not been the case so far with the Paine Webber fund , however . ) In selecting countries for investment , Pagliuca , who has run the $98 million fund since December 1986 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Germany 's Bundesbank , that keeps a tight leash on the money supply . Such a policy , she says , supports the nation 's currency and bond market . <p> Expecting a budget agreement in Washington , Pagliuca earlier this year invested as much as 50% of the portfolio in five- to seven-year Treasuries . But Iraq 's invasion undermined budget-cutting efforts , and after gaining 6.1% to Sept. 1  --  average for the category  --  Pagliuca is now shifting into French , Italian and Australian bonds . <p> The Paine Webber fund has clearly been the better performer recently . Bear in mind , though , that the fund 's annual fees run a high 2% , compared with 1.5% for the Fidelity fund ; that steep expense ratio includes a yield-nipping annual 12b-1 sales charge of 0.9% . Also note that the fund levies a redemption fee as high as 5% if you sell your shares within six years . Still , the Paine Webber fund makes sense if your main investment goal is income and you do n't mind paying sales loads to get it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a falling dollar , the no-load , lower-expense Fidelity fund is the more cost-effective choice . At a Glance Global bonds for income or total return <p> Paine Webber 's Master Global focuses on consistent high yields , while Fidelity Global Bond aims for both income and capital gains . But Paine Webber has actually posted the higher three-year total return because its greater foreign exposure gave it a currency kick when the dollar fell this year .
