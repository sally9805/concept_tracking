<p> Andy and Robin Schneider want their three kids to get a taste of music , sports , art and dance as they grow up , and they want them to have a sense of accomplishment . <p> So the Washington , D.C. , couple cart their kids to lessons and activities . They 've tried not to overdo it , but still their schedule would make a professional organizer 's head spin . A quick rundown : <p> Matthew , 10 , is playing basketball now , takes music lessons on the recorder and after-school enrichment classes . He plays soccer in the fall and spring , and he swims competitively in the summer . He 's also in the school play . <p> Nora , 8 , plays basketball and has a gymnastics class and a piano lesson once a week . She takes enrichment classes offered after school and a math skills class . She plays soccer and baseball in the spring and fall and swims competitively in the summer . She 's also in the school play . <p> Allison , 4 1/2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To keep track of everyone , there 's a color-coded chart on the refrigerator . <p> " I think experts would look at our kids ' lives and think they must need to have less in their lives , " says Robin Schneider , a lawyer , who works until early afternoon and then chauffeurs her kids for the rest of the day . <p> " But one thing I 've found about my kids is they really prefer to have more going on rather than less . They do n't seem to burn out on these things and they really do have a good time doing them . " <p> Still , the Schneiders cut down to no more than one sport a season for Matthew , who 's getting more homework . And neither Matthew nor Nora participates in scouting . " That was one thing too many . " <p> Many parents wrestle with the number of activities they should encourage their children to do . How can they expose them to lots of experiences without burning them out ? What 's the right mix of doing things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they being shortchanged ? <p> The experts have no single right formula , except they say you need to know your kids . <p> Parents need to strike a balance for their kids with artistic lessons , sports and group activities and family time and play time , says David Elkind , author of The Hurried Child ( Addison-Wesley , $ 10.95 ) . <p> Parents have to be careful not to push their kids too much and squeeze out valuable family time . " It troubles me when parents have so little time today with everybody working that when we do have time with the kids , we take them to lessons , " says Elkind , a professor of child studies at Tufts University , Medford , Mass . <p> There 's no rush to get your kids signed up for lessons as soon as they 're out of diapers . <p> " I strongly believe there is no need for formal lessons for kids as young as 4 or 5 , " he says . They can do some activities like tumbling class for fun . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " Some lessons are sold to parents that they will raise kids ' self-esteem but as far as I know there is no evidence to support that , " he says . " I think sometimes you put children at risk by putting them in competitive situations . If they do n't do well , there is something wrong with them . " <p> Louise Bates Ames , co-founder of the Gesell Institute in New Haven , Conn. , agrees . " I do n't favor preschoolers taking music lessons . " As for swimming , " I hate it for babies . I would n't offer it before 5 , but that 's not a scientific judgment . " <p> There 's no perfect age to start kids on lessons , she says . " A lot depends on the child . It 's very important that the activity or the sport is the child 's wish . " <p> Starting kids too young may burn them out , Elkind says . " Often in sports kids start early and by the time they are 13 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be the time when they could really enjoy it . " <p> But by the time kids are 6 , 7 or 8 , it 's reasonable that they might want to sample different activities , the experts say . <p> Elkind suggests limiting elementary kids to one sports activity a season , one social activity and one artistic endeavor . So you might have a child who is in soccer , scouts and music lessons . Just do n't let it become all-encompassing so that the children have no time for themselves , he warns . <p> If children want to focus on one activity that they 're really passionate about , that 's fine , Elkind says . <p> Whatever you do , listen to the kids , Ames says . They 'll tell you what they want . <p> Robin Schneider says she 's learned to read her kids . " What I 've found over time is you can kind of tell what your child wants to put his energy into . We watch them to see how they feel about it . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as they do . " <p> Her kids ' activities are their ideas . Just recently , she asked them if they wanted to drop anything . They did n't . <p> She says there are nights that Matthew would rather go home and play with a friend than go to his music lesson . " But you 'll never hear him say ' I do n't want to go to soccer . ' " <p> Their family time is often attending sports events and then going out for lunch afterward . The kids still have plenty of time to play with their friends and read , she says . <p> Schneider says she 's the only one who sometimes feels stressed out . What gets sacrificed with all this late afternoon running around is they do n't have elaborate dinners . " We make pasta quickly or I pick up a chicken that 's already cooked . " <p> But it 's worth it to her . " I would much rather have them involved in activities than just hanging around and watching TV and not doing much with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the time , money or inclination to put kids in lessons or activities should n't feel they are cheating their children , experts say . <p> Kids can thrive if they read , play with friends , have some hobbies and responsibilities , says child development expert David Elkind . <p> " Reading is a wonderful pastime for kids who are not involved in other kinds of activities . Just as long as they do n't sit in front of the tube and Nintendo all the time . " <p> Parents also need to keep in mind that they have talents to share with their kids , he says . " It 's important to share the skills we have whether we love to garden , fish , hunt , sew or cook . That 's teaching kids too . We under-estimate our own teaching capabilities and the wonderful relationship that that helps build . " <p> No matter how active children are , they do need some down time , he says . " I hear so much about kids being bored . But when they are programmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have anything planned they are lost . <p> " Giving kids some free time to use on their own prepares them for doing just that . When they have time on their hands , they can use it imaginatively or productively . " <p> A balance of parental prodding and patience <p> First , they want to take piano lessons , then flute , trombone , ballet , tap , jazz , karate , horseback riding . . . <p> Parents have to know when to gently encourage their kids to stick with something and when to pull back , experts say . There are some kids who will test everything and do a lot of things before they find something they really like , says David Elkind , a child development expert and author of Miseducation ( Knopf , $ 12 ) . <p> If your child starts something , for instance , playing a musical instrument , and does n't like it , try to be open-minded , he says . Suggest they give it a few tries and if they really do n't like it , maybe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force them if they hate it . It 's a waste of time and money . " <p> They may try a couple of instruments before they find one they enjoy . Some kids do n't find an instrument they like until late in their school years , says Elkind . <p> Sometimes it 's not the activity , but the setting or the teacher that does n't click , he points out . His own son disliked one art class he took , but tried another and loved it . <p> As a parent , you do n't want to invest too much money or emotion in any activity , because kids do change their minds , says child development expert Louise Bates Ames . But on the other hand , you do n't want too much starting and dropping out , she says . " A lot of people make big expenditures and then the child does n't like it . " <p> Many girls are " dying to ride horses " around age 11 . But even that love affair with horses usually lasts only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere about it before I buy the horse . "
