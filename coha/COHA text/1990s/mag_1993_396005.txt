Gloom and despair have settled over Hollywood . A " highly placed studio executive " recently told the New York Times that the industry 's mood is one of " self-loathing " ; the films being produced , the mogul said , were " a lot of formulaic , by-the-numbers , cliche-ridden , high-concept garbage . " Still , from Westwood to Studio City , the creative fires do burn on  --  though not on soundstages or in story conferences . In 1993 , Hollywood 's true auteurs are its marketers , the men and women charged with luring an increasingly skeptical public into the theaters . The sort of genius that once was displayed in a deft tracking shot or a well-executed plot twist can now be detected in the subtlety of a product tie-in or the grace of a phone call to the producers of Entertainment Tonight . To showcase the increasingly challenging job of the Hollywood marketer , Harper 's Magazine green-lighted some high-concept garbage of our own  --  Save the Earth , a megabudget , environmentally correct rain-forest love story . We pitched our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the impossible : to transform Save the Earth into next summer 's runaway hit . The following forum is based on a discussion held in March at Maple Drive , a restaurant in Beverly Hills . Paul Tough served as moderator . THE MARKETING TEAM PAUL TOUGH is a senior editor of Harper 's Magazine . MARK GILL is the senior vice president of publicity and promotion for Columbia Pictures . JEFFREY GODSICK is the executive vice president of entertainment at Rogers &; Cowan , the largest publicity agency in Hollywood . BOB ISRAEL is the CEO and cofounder of Aspect Ratio , a Hollywood advertising agency . JOE NIMZIKI is the executive vice president of Cimarron Bacon O'Brien , a Hollywood advertising agency . THE POSITIONING PAUL TOUGH : Welcome to the first meeting of the team responsible for marketing Save the Earth . You 've all read the coverage see page 35 , so you know the story we 're working with . Our two lead roles have been cast : Julia Roberts will play Daphne , the devoted young anthropologist who stumbles onto evidence of an ecological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest . Jake  --  the environmental biologist who falls in love with her  --  is played by Steven Seagal . This will be his first film outside the action/adventure genre , and he sees it as an opportunity to be taken seriously by a wide audience . Our director , who is down in Brazil right now scouting locations , has cast a Yanomamo chieftain in the role of Kumchika , the medicine man who saves the planet 's ecosystem . His dialogue will be subtitled . As you know , our studio head is passionately committed to this movie and has personally approved its $47 million budget . He 's been quoted in the trades as saying , " This is more than just a movie for me ; this is what I got into this crazy business to do  --  something meaningful , for myself and for the planet . " Save the Earth will be released in the summer of 1994 . Now , before we even start shooting , what sort of marketing decisions do we have to make ? JEFFREY GODSICK : The first thing we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this movie to the journalists who are going to write about it early on . Forget direct contact with the consumer at this point  --  that 's twelve months away . Right now it 's the press that 's going to transmit our message to the consumer . We 've got to make sure that they send the message we want , or our movie will be positioned wrong . MARK GILL : It 's a matter of getting the interpretation we want . Disney could have sold Dead Poets Society as a suicide movie instead of an uplifting story about a really inspiring teacher . But , wisely , they took care to position it as the latter . BOB ISRAEL : In this case , I do n't think we want to push the ecological angle . GILL : I agree . I think we want to push the adventure . ISRAEL : I was actually thinking we might want to push the romance . In any case , what we want to avoid is the actual story . TOUGH : How would you position the movie , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's an epic romantic adventure . GILL : About ? ISRAEL : I do n't want to do " about . " I want to run from the story . I want to run from the whole environmental theme . I think it 's box-office poison . My main job here is going to be to cut together a trailer , the preview of our movie that will play in theaters . The trailer I 'd like to make does n't tell the story at all . It probably does n't even have any dialogue . It 's just music and quick cuts . GILL : To find our position , I 'd look at the great adventures like The Hunt for Red October . In that situation we had a handy nemesis  --  the Soviet Union . That 's gone now . So what 's the new evil ? The threat to the ecosystem . ISRAEL : It 's starting to sound political . GILL : I 'm not at all suggesting that we politicize it , but one man fighting the big evil works extraordinarily well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a political movie . I mean , Hunt for Red October had political overtones . Even when you go back to the World War II adventures , it was one man against a huge enemy . ISRAEL : I just do n't think people want to see a movie about one guy defending the ecosystem . JOE NIMZIKI : Usually I would be right on the bandwagon with Bob saying , " Let 's get away from the movie , " and we definitely want to shy away from making it one man trying to save the world , which borders on the ridiculous , especially if we 're trying to tell the story in a two-minute trailer . But we need some tension and drama , or else we 're going to end up advertising this as a movie about nothing . And " A Movie About Nothing " is not a very catchy tag line . ISRAEL : You know , this is the king of movie that politically aware , well-educated people are talking about when they say , " Why does n't Hollywood make more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The intent is noble , but the execution is inevitably banal . The sad reality is , every time Hollywood tries to make a politically correct movie , it bombs . THE MERCHANDISING TOUGH : Let 's talk about promotional tie-ins . Do we need to begin approaching various companies now about licensing Save the Earth products ? GILL : First we want to talk to the director and make sure this film is going to be rated PG-13 . TOUGH : Well , there 's some serious sex in it . GILL : If you really want to make an R-rated movie , say good-bye to all your corporate promotion . Say good-bye to Burger King . Say good-bye to Choice Hotels . Say good-bye to Coca-Cola . They do n't want to be involved with an R-rated movie . The end . No discussion . TOUGH : What about the eighteen-year-old guy who wants to see Julia Roberts , you know- GILL : Let 's look at it this way . Only a third of the movies that have made $100 million were R-rated . Do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a decision based on an eighteen-year-old 's hormones ? NIMZIKI : Actually , I think we can do both . We can do a PG-13 version of this rain-forest sex scene and have it more than steamy and titillating enough for your advertising . GILL : Once you 've got a PG-13 , the floodgates are open . Now you go after everything in the world . You can go after corporations in a hundred different categories . They 'll be delighted to be onboard with this movie , because it shows that they 're not the evil , mean old polluter industrialist nightmare from hell . NIMZIKI : I can see it now : Exxon Save the Earth hats ... GILL : Well , okay , maybe not everybody . GODSICK : But even though we 're going to avoid the environment in our advertising , that angle is a definite plus when we 're seeking corporate promotional tie-ins . Companies are doing everything they can to get out there and try to show they 're environmental . GILL : The premise is that this project grants companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance to license something that is extremely credible . Nobody 's going to criticize a company for tying in with a movie . It 's a no-risk way of buying into the environment . TOUGH : If we assume that every corporation in America wants to get onboard , where do we start ? Who 's going to help us the most ? GILL : Well , we want to go after the big , brand-name advertisers . The reason is simple : we can piggyback on their advertising . On a $47 million film the studio will probably spend $15 million on advertising . A fast-food company might buy another $10 to $15 million of their own advertising , featuring clips from our movie , to promote the tie-in . That 's a big help . NIMZIKI : We start off with a fast-food restaurant that will give out action figures or cups with scenes from the film . Not only is that wonderful publicity ; it 's a place where you might hint at the message a little bit . GILL : They would be recyclable cups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast-food restaurant and a beverage : Coca-Cola or Pepsi . You get your recyclable Save the Earth cup from Burger King , but only when you order Pepsi . And Pepsi chips in another few million in advertising . GILL : Let 's go to the third step , which is that we want to cross-tie this to MTV . We want a contest in which the winners get to spend a day with Julia or with Steven , and we want that cross-promoted with Burger King . You enter the contest in the restaurant . GODSICK : Once you go to MTV , it 's a perfect opportunity to do a " We Are the World "  --  style environmental song . We get some great music stars to write a song called " Save the Earth , " and we do a music video around that , again elevating this thing as important but not being too preachy . ISRAEL : Hold on , hold on . It will automatically be too preachy . We 've got to avoid the content of the film . It 's got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go back to our original positioning , which is that this is an epic romantic adventure . No " about . " GODSICK : I do n't think it 's preachy for your favorite music people to sing a song about being good to the environment . That 's almost hip these days . ISRAEL : But if it 's associated with this film , then we 've got a film about being good to the environment . TOUGH : Are there any other companies we should go to now ? GODSICK : We might want to go to a clothing company , like the Gap or Patagonia , that could take us into malls . That way , we can hit our audience really hard through retail . GILL : And the premise there is very clear . We 're going to be competing on the television screen with the five other movies that are opening when we are . In a store where we 've got a display , we 're the only movie . You walk into that store and you wo n't forget us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our trailer on video monitors in the store . That lets us expose people to the trailer in a non-traditional location , outside the movie theater . It 's much more effective . GILL : The only way for us to reach our audience is to cut through the advertising clutter that surrounds them . And this is a clutter-free opportunity . TOUGH : What about finding a public-interest group of some sort to hook in with at this early stage ? GILL : Well , here 's a sort of absurd idea . I think we need to find a town that has not yet discovered environmental responsibility and take it over . We help them convert everything in their lives to be ecologically sensitive . The corporations that sponsor this get to feel like good-hearted citizens . The town will become the absolute epitome of American spirit and patriotism . It will be all over the front page of USA Today . ISRAEL : How do you tie in the film ? GODSICK : We form something called the Save the Earth Coalition with five major sponsors  --  Coca-Cola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth Coalition is the foundation that funds the whole thing . The movie title keeps getting wrapped up into it . And , of course , for the big event in the town we bring in the stars from the film . GILL : And the question will always be , " Why are they doing this ? " And the answer will be , " Oh , because this wonderful movie is coming out . " GODSICK : It also mirrors the theme of the film , which is that people are the solution to this problem . The town gets cleaned up , but only because people commit to it . GILL : And the best part of it , of course , is that they will adopt a sister village in the rain forest . NIMZIKI : And you can never predict what will happen . We could have a serious ecological crisis on our hands when we release . Three Mile Island blew two weeks after The China Syndrome was released : that 's a perfect example of how a crisis can elevate a movie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And who knows ? People might embrace the environmental message more than we expect . I would want to be in a position to get the environmental stuff out after the movie opens ; it 'd make a great second week . First we tap our audience for the entertainment value ; after a couple of weeks , if there 's any reception at all to this movie , we get our stars together for the cause . ISRAEL : I like the idea , in theory . But ultimately what it 's going to come down to is this : two months before the movie opens , we 're going to start testing our trailers and posters with randomly selected shoppers in malls  --  and what I think they 're going to tell us is that they do n't care about the environmental aspects of this film . And then it 's a question of how much we play up the adventure aspect . GILL : A lot . ISRAEL : I mean , it 'd be wonderful if we had a Raiders of the Lost Ark . That 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that movie . But if it 's true that there is n't enough to support it as a Raiders  --  and God knows we 'll do everything we can to make it seem like it is  --  then we have to say , " Well , what 's left ? " How are we going to salvage what could be a disaster ? What we 'll do is test spots that are romantic and hope that romantic with a secondary aspect of action is enough . Maybe it becomes more of a women 's picture  --  but one with enough action that women can convince their dates to go too . THE SOUNDTRACK TOUGH : What about the soundtrack ? Is that going to be a big deal for this movie ? GODSICK : I think the soundtrack should be a big deal . It helps widen our audience . Whether you do a " Save the Earth " song or not , I think the soundtrack should be released well before the film is . And it might be nice to think about doing something special . What about having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A theme album sounds like a theme park : absolute death . I think you just want it to be an event album to go with an event movie . GODSICK : But I would have major stars . I 'm talking about Springsteen doing a song . I 'm talking about Whitney Houston doing a song . NIMZIKI : This is where we take advantage of our environmental angle . It 's a very fine line for us to walk , but I think the fact that the message of the movie is so politically correct is our means to get these big stars to do the album . ISRAEL : It is a fine line : we get them in by talking about the environment , but we make sure the songs they do are not overtly environmental . TOUGH : How about a David Byrne/Paul Simon  --  type song incorporating the traditional music of the Yanomamos ? GILL : That 'll work for about 10 percent of our audience . We need a much bigger hit than that . GODSICK : I 'd rather see Springsteen . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . I 'm not saying there 's a big ethnic market for this movie , but let 's not pigeonhole it as white right away . NIMZIKI : Even an urban dance or rap song with a real soft-coated message would be up our alley . And , actually , I would say throw in Paul Simon too . GILL : But him alone ? NIMZIKI : No , but it would n't hurt to have one song by Paul Simon and a Brazilian band . We want the soundtrack to be as diverse as we can get . GODSICK : If it 's done right , the soundtrack could make the film important , simply because of the quality of people involved . ISRAEL : That sparks something for me . The positioning for this movie may ultimately be that it is an important movie . That 's something we have n't considered . GILL : Oh , God help us . Just shoot me now . Are you kidding me ? A $50 million important movie ? How many of those work each year ? And how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less than zero . For our highbrow audience , yes , it 's got to be an important movie , but for everyone else , we 've got to come back to what you said before , which was much smarter : it 's an epic romantic adventure . Period . NIMZIKI : I think it 's always better to let an audience discover a film that 's important . You do n't want to tell them , " This is an important film . " That 's the kiss of death . THE TEASER TRAILER TOUGH : So far , we 've been talking about decisions that are n't going to take effect for another year . How do we start to get our message out to the audience directly ? NIMZIKI : With a movie this big , I think we 're going to want what 's known as a teaser trailer , which comes out as much as six months before the movie 's release . In our case , since we 're doing a summer movie , we 'll attach the teaser to our big Christmas release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teaser trailer says is , This movie 's going to be an event . GILL : It also means that come next spring , when the Los Angeles Times Calendar section and Entertainment Weekly are predicting what the five big summer movies are going to be , we 're automatically on the list . ISRAEL : We do n't want to reveal too much in our teaser ; it 's just a great piece of music and big images . It 's got sex . And it 's got enough adventure to suggest something more . NIMZIKI : We promise something amazing : " Here 's Steven Seagal as you 've never seen him before . Julia Roberts is back . " And we need a slight hint of what the story is  --  " in his greatest adventure yet " or " in a movie that affects us all "  --  a simple tag line that does n't get preachy , does n't get political , does n't even tell you the exact dilemma they 're in . And then there might very well be room for a montage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the titillating romance , the action , the beauty shots of our stars . ISRAEL : I like Joe 's trailer , but I would n't make it the teaser trailer . I 'd make it the final trailer . Because our story trailer  --  the one that we put out a month or two before the movie  --  has to develop from the teaser . Unless we go to story , which I do n't want to do , I do n't think there 's any place to go from Joe 's trailer . TOUGH : So you 're saying no teaser at all ? ISRAEL : I think not . I 'm just terrified of getting into the story , which is what we 're going to be forced to do if this is our teaser . NIMZIKI : But in the real world this is a $47 million movie and the president of the studio is saying this is the most important film he 's ever made . There 's going to be a teaser . GILL : How about a concept teaser  --  no footage at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash the names of the stars . Promise the thrill , promise the adventure , show the names , get out . NIMZIKI : I think you 've got to have some urgency to it . Perhaps you have the sound of ticking to give the message : Time 's running out . Or maybe you start on an image you ca n't quite make out and you slowly pull back to reveal that it 's the Earth . ISRAEL : But that 's going away from the position that we agreed on . That goes back to the environment . NIMZIKI : You do n't have to lean on it . You do n't want to tell the whole story . You still want to do your big montage wrap-up . But time as a metaphor is critical , especially if we 're concealing the plot . There has to be some sense of urgency or conflict , and we can get that by quick-cutting images , by saying , " Time is running out , " and maybe by laying driving music underneath . The film might not deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest lots of both . ISRAEL : But to me , the ticking clock is off the position . People will stay away in droves if they think this movie has a social message . Everything we do has to convince them that it does n't . THE FEATURE STORIES TOUGH : At this early stage , while we 're still filming , what are we doing in terms of publicity ? GILL : We invite selected press to the set : major outlets like the New York Times , the Los Angeles Times , Premiere magazine , and Entertainment Weekly . We 're going to let about half of them write about the movie right away , to create an early buzz . The other half will bank their stories , to run when we release the film . And in both cases , these reporters are pretty much going to take our spoon-feeding . But if we do n't create a nice loving spoonful for them that accurately reflects our movie , we 're in trouble . GODSICK : The only other outlet I would add is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press follow the morning shows , so that will help us set their agenda early . TOUGH : Do you have to do a selling job at this point on the editors and producers ? GODSICK : It 's not hard to get someone to see Julia Roberts and Steven Seagal on the set . The risk is in mis-selling the movie . If we call up the editor of Premiere and say , " Yeah , we 've got this thing about saving the Earth , " we 're in trouble . TOUGH : But is n't this exactly when we want to use the environmental angle ? Are these editors really going to want to do big feature stories without a hook like that ? GILL : Come on . The reality is that these are two stars everybody wants to see . Ask the immortal question posed by Dawn Steel , who used to run Columbia : " Are they fuckable ? " And these two absolutely are . These are two hot , hot stars . TOUGH : What about the more personality-driven magazines , like Vanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a star who wants to be profiled , you 're fine . But he or she is going to have to reveal a lot . Our stars might have had problems that they do n't want to share with the readers of Esquire . NIMZIKI : And I 'd be wary of letting Steven Seagal loose with the press . This is a stretch for him , and he 's trying to prove to America that he 's a serious actor . He 's going to harp on that point in his interview , whether the studio wants him to or not . I 've seen stars in this position before . They go on the big talk shows and say , " This is n't an action movie ; it 's got an important message . It 's intelligent and serious , like me . " And bingo , we 're off position . GILL : Do n't worry . We 'll make sure that he 's well trained about what to say and what not to say . It 's like coaching a political candidate : we convince him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It 's now January 1994 . We 're in a screening room at the studio , and we 're about to see a rough cut of the movie . It 's an early version : it has n't even been test-marketed yet . The director 's here ; Julia and Steven are here . What are we thinking as the lights go down ? NIMZIKI : What am I going to say to them if it 's bad ? GODSICK : That 's easy . You just say , " Steven , Steven , Steven ! " GILL : " You did it again ! " GODSICK : No , really , what we 're looking for in the film is elements we can use to do our jobs . Maybe Steven Seagal turned out to be fantastic ; maybe there 's something we did n't anticipate that turned out great . NIMZIKI : And it 's a two-part process too . I mean we 're all going to walk in and have our opinion of the film , but the next step 's going to be recruited screenings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular moviegoing audience , not a jaded , tainted , cynical crowd like us . And who knows ? We might find that teenage girls eat it up . We might find that the boys are in love with Julia Roberts . Sometimes you think you have a movie that 's going to be in trouble and the scores are great . GILL : So , do we have a movie that scores well or not ? TOUGH : Well , I do n't know . We have n't tested it yet . I can tell you my personal opinion . It looks to me like Steven and Julia did n't really get along . There 's not a lot of spark between them . GODSICK : So the romance does n't work . ISRAEL : So the movie does n't work . GILL : What were you thinking when you green-lighted this ? TOUGH : Do we  --  as marketers  --  now try to get involved in recutting the movie ? GILL : Absolutely . This is the moment to put in our two cents . ISRAEL : What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot more action/adventure footage so that we have an opportunity to position it more like a Raiders . The studio is going to say , " Holy shit , this movie is a bomb . We 've got to go and spend another couple million . " TOUGH : What if the studio wo n't shell out ? Does the fact that it looks to us like there 's no heat between the stars mean that we have to abandon the romance angle ? ISRAEL : Not necessarily . The fact that it does n't work in the movie does n't mean that it wo n't in the trailer . GILL : He 's right . It does n't matter if the movie does n't deliver . If you can create the impression that the movie delivers , you 're fine . That 's the difference between playability and marketability . When you 've got playability , you show it to the critics . If you 've got marketability , there 's enough there to cheat it or stretch it and make people believe that it really does deliver . TOUGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the romance category , we have marketability but not playability . The romance really does n't play , but we can probably find enough wistful looks to make our trailer work . NIMZIKI : Actually , I 'm not so pessimistic . I think we 've got the makings of a great trailer here . We 're going to have enough one-liners and witty bits of dialogue . We 've got enough good sex . And we 're going to have enough good action . Out of ninety minutes , we 've got to be able to come up with a good ninety seconds . TOUGH : But at this point , if the movie 's looking like a dog , should n't we start to put more of our resources toward the other films on our summer list ? GILL : No way . There 's too much riding on this . Our chairman has said that this is the most important movie he 's ever made  --  which , by the way , means it 's a guaranteed failure . But as much as we might like to abandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important this is . NIMZIKI : This is our worst-case scenario . When you take a little film and make it look good , it 's wonderful . When you have a movie like this , which is costing the studio a fortune and which will create mass panic if it does n't make its money back , jobs are on the line . You have to believe in your head that this movie can and will succeed . You have to find a way to bring it to its audience . GILL : And the terrible , horrible , scary thing is that every now and then we actually make it work . THE STORY TRAILER TOUGH : Tell me about the second trailer , the story trailer . What are we going to do for that ? NIMZIKI : I would probably start with a shot of Steven Seagal and a line like , " He 's always been a fighter , but he 's never had so much to fight for . " I 'd want to get his audience in , promising them what they want : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he 's never had so much to fight for " puts in a hint of something more . GILL : Which brings in , guess who ? NIMZIKI : Our next shot is Julia Roberts . We definitely want to say , " She 's back , and we 've got her . " And if this romance is something we 're going to sell , we 're going to push a Julia Roberts love line hard . ISRAEL : " In love with a people , in love with the country , and in love with a man . " GILL : Now bring in the threat . ISRAEL : And then the conflict could be : " In the least likely place on Earth , they fell in love  --  at the worst possible time . " NIMZIKI : Next we want the quintessential villain line . We want our bad guy to say , " They 're screwing up our plan . We 've got to cut down these trees to put in our dump . " Once we 've hinted at the story elements , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running and kissing and- ISRAEL : " Two people have never kissed at this speed before . " GODSICK : At last we have a tag line ! NIMZIKI : And if this footage is as spectacular as I hope it will be , we can use the shots of people joining hands and chanting without actually saying , " They 're saving the world . " ISRAEL : Maybe the chant actually starts to drive the montage . GODSICK : You know , if that chant 's really great , you could take it out of the movie and put it into the first single off the soundtrack . It becomes a kind of symbol . ISRAEL : Here 's the poster : You 've got the two of them in the rain forest , hugging or holding hands in the midst of all these Indians , as a volcano explodes behind them . The whole background 's on fire . TOUGH : Do you have copy for the poster ? ISRAEL : I think you say the names . " Steven Seagal and Julia Roberts  --  " GILL : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : "  --  of global proportions . " NIMZIKI : It 's got to be something about " the fight of their life " or " time is running out . " Some real generic line that suggests that there 's something a little important about this movie . GILL : It 's not just that the town is going to be destroyed ; a way of life is going to come to an end , which is metaphoric for the end of the universe . ISRAEL : Yeah . I like that . GILL : So : " A town is about to be destroyed . Their friends are about to be killed . A way of life is about to end forever . Only these two can stop it ... And they 're running out of time . " THE REVIEWS TOUGH : How are we going to use these images and these ideas when we go to the press ? GILL : We 're going to work from the same positioning that we 've already developed . That goes for everything we give them . We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of videotape that 's like a mini-documentary of the film . We 're going to hand out clips that emphasize our chosen themes and that hide the elements of the story we 're uncomfortable with . And the remarkable thing we 're going to discover is that the press people are going to pick up our exact phrases and words and incorporate them in their stories . TOUGH : So we 're going to be able to convince critics that this is a romance ? GILL : There are ten different ways to describe any movie . If we give them one way to go , and it 's at least marginally credible , chances are they 're going to take it and go with it . Reviewers may ultimately say bad things about it , but most of the feature stories will use our positioning to describe the movie . GODSICK : And every TV reviewer is going to run a clip from the film . If the clip works with our advertising position , then they 're supporting our campaign , even if they give us a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that support our message . NIMZIKI : The main reason we need reviews is to create what 's called a review spot , a thirty-second TV ad with quotes from reviews read over scenes from the movie . It 's only thirty seconds ; all we need are five or six good reviews , out of the hundreds of reviews the film is going to get . We run the spot in the first week of release , once all the negative reviews are out . What it says to the audience is , " Forget the bad reviews you 've read . This is a quality film . " TOUGH : What about a press junket ? Are we going to do something out of the ordinary ? GILL : Well , the really big splash would be to fly everybody down to Rio de Janeiro . If we 've got the money , that would be a gold mine . It would make people think it 's a special event . TOUGH : At the junket , Julia and Steven are going to do about fifty TV interviews in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the night before ? GILL : " You 're going to get a lot of questions about things you 're not going to want to answer . All you have to say is , " I 'm not here to talk about that , but I would love to tell you about my movie . ' And as you 're talking about the movie , make sure you remember this one phrase . " And then we give them our positioning line : " It 's an epic romantic adventure , set in a stunning location , about a struggle to save a village . " We have to keep them on the message . THE DAMAGE CONTROL TOUGH : It 's now a week after the junket . Donald Wildmon of the American Family Association holds a press conference . He says that he 's heard from people who have seen this movie that it glorifies pantheism and paganism and has a very anti-Christian message . GODSICK : He said that about Home Alone . GILL : Wake me when it 's over . Nobody listens to Donald Wildmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't matter . If Ross Perot is nailing our movie , we 've got a problem . GODSICK : And there are ways to combat it . There are experts we can show our movie to . There are psychologists , there are teachers . And they 'll say it 's wholesome and positive . GILL : For every expert you can dredge up on the Reverend Donald Wildmon front , there are ten others we can pull up from other sides who are going to love the movie . I would say we do n't even bother to dignify the Reverend Donald with a response . Who cares ? If we can show him the movie and shut him up altogether , terrific . Otherwise , ignore him . GODSICK : And if he pickets , we get press coverage . GILL : This controversy does n't go to the core of our movie 's credibility . It 's not going to hurt us . It 's only going to help us . It just fans the flames . TOUGH : The day after Wildmon 's press conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way our film crew treated the environment down in Brazil . It turns out that we cut down a lot of trees when we built our sets . It 's sort of a wry article , insinuating , " Is n't it ironic that they actually harmed the rain forest while they were trying to make this so-called environmental movie ? " What do we do ? GODSICK : Get Wildmon back ! GILL : Our side of the story is this : it turns out that some crew members did not follow proper environmental procedure . But the stars of the movie were terribly disappointed by that and have now , as a countermeasure , started a campaign in this country to demonstrate that even people who are involved in a movie on this subject could somehow fail to be cautious enough about these things . It just underscores the point that we all need to be reminded about the importance of the rain forest . Our stars , in all their wattage , are going to blow the shit out of a story about a couple of crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USA Today , the networks , everybody is going to follow Julia Roberts to this school where she 's going to teach third-graders how to recycle . GODSICK : You might even take these stars in front of Congress , which will get you a hell of a lot of media coverage . GILL : Right . They 've seen close at hand how dangerous it is . Even people working on a movie that is trying to change things , even they slip . So it 's more important than ever , and Julia Roberts is out here to tell you why . And I promise you , with that kind of star wattage , the other story will be totally forgotten two days later . THE PREMIERE TOUGH : The movie 's opening in a week . What do we have planned for a premiere ? GILL : Clearly we 're looking at a benefit . TOUGH : For whom ? Greenpeace ? GILL : Let 's get real here . We 've got Corporate America tied in to this . GODSICK : You do n't want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can raise money . TOUGH : Does our premiere have a gimmick ? GODSICK : For every ticket that 's sold , ten trees will be planted . GILL : And you can not come to the premiere unless you 've shared a ride . You can not come in a limousine . It 's the anti-Hollywood premiere . TOUGH : And stars are going to show up ? GILL : Sure . There 'll be too many people for them to suck up to . They wo n't be able to stay away . NIMZIKI : Between a big movie spectacle like this and a party concept that 's so politically correct , I think we 'll get a huge turnout . GILL : Having a theme is critical . It 's a nugget that the media can take away when they 're covering the event . Thirty camera crews turn out for every one of these things . GODSICK : And it gives them more of a story to walk away with than " Al Pacino showed up with so-and-so . " NIMZIKI : You could get very interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections , you might have Gore there , even Clinton . THE VERDICT TOUGH : Well , the premiere was fun , but now the numbers are in : our movie made $5 million in its first weekend . GILL : Ishtar ! Ishtar ! NIMZIKI : Great . We 're all fired . TOUGH : Why do we take the fall ? What were we supposed to do ? The movie was terrible . GILL : So was Alien sup 3 . But it made $23 million in its opening weekend . ISRAEL : Basically , what we 're responsible for is a strong opening . NIMZIKI : After about two weeks , it 's mostly word-of-mouth . Our job is pretty much over . TOUGH : So the biggest success for a marketer is to have an enormous opening weekend and then have the film tank ? GILL : If that happens , you know that the film was terrible but the marketing was genius . Obviously you prefer to have the movie hold on very well . But if it opens big and then crashes , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . COVERAGE FOR SAVE THE EARTH , AN ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY PLOT : Act One sets up our conflict  --  three good guys , plenty of bad guys . The good guys are Jake , the hunky scientist whose computers are telling him that an eco-disaster is around the corner ; Kumchika , a Brazilian rain-forest medicine man whose mystical powers are telling him the same thing ; and Daphne , the gorgeous anthropologist who will bring them together . The bad guys are the big-business polluter types who want to put a toxic waste dump in the rain forest , where Kumchika 's tribe makes its home . Meanwhile , the weather 's going nuts : heat waves in Iceland ; a cold snap in the Yucatan . Act Two brings Jake into the rain forest . He 's hit on the head during a storm , rescued by the native Indians , and nursed back to life by Daphne . Needless to say , Jake and Daphne fall in love ; there 's a steamy sex scene in the rain forest . At Daphne 's urging , Jake reluctantly sheds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells him that people have to communicate directly with nature in order to avert this eco-disaster . Our three heroes decide to leave the rain forest and go to America , where they 'll take their message to the world via the news media . ( On the way there 's some great fish-out-of-water business with Kumchika in a luxury Rio hotel . ) But before they can leave Brazil , the polluters , eager to keep our heroes quiet , kidnap Kumchika . Act Three starts with the shoot-'em-up rescue of Kumchika and the beginning of a series of ever-worsening ecological disasters : floods , tornadoes , mud slides . Thousands die . Our three heroes go on TV and announce Kumchika 's prescription : people have to band together and chant a traditional hymn , which asks nature to save us from ourselves . Conclusion is an international montage of togetherness , as people join hands and chant . It works : earthquakes swallow toxic waste dumps ; animals wreck factories ; volcanic dust blocks out the sun , reversing global warming ; the eco-balance is restored . Daphne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians . ANALYSIS : Weak premise , some action , great special-effects opportunities . With star power , could be big , environmental aspect might pull upscale crowd . <p>
