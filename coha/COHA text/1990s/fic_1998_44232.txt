They always put Foley and me together . From the time he was four and I was two , they thought it was cute the way we 'd hug and hold hands and toddle around together . With him being mildly retarded , and boys being slower than girls anyway , we were just about equal in what we could do . Even so , if you look at the photos from those days , you 'll see it 's me who 's holding Foley 's hand , me who 's hugging him , while he just kind of stands there . <p> Where you see it most is in the pictures from Ocean City , when they put us on the rides at Playland . We always went on the Fairy Whip , mostly because it 's the very first ride as you come in the door . My mom says I started us riding together , because Foley cried when he was by himself in the flower-shaped car . I scrambled out of my blossom and climbed in beside him . They took the pictures just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Foley 's mouth is all lopsided in a wail . You can see the tears glistening on his cheeks . I have my arms around him tight , laughing like anything . <p> We went to Ocean City every summer , and one of my aunts or their boyfriends always took snapshots . My mom had stopped taking pictures by then . My aunts say she always cut people 's heads off or showed their big behinds . My father videos everything with his camcorder , but even if we are n't too self-conscious , he hardly ever holds still long enough so you can see what people are really doing , what they 're thinking , or even if they 're having fun . <p> My folks do n't drink much usually , but once on every vacation , when we kids were put to bed and all the grownups were sitting around on the porch , they used to get loaded . I 'd lie awake listening to the voices downstairs , whispering at first , so as not to wake us up , then louder , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's low chuckle . Once I woke up from a bad dream or something and went downstairs and saw her , perched in the big rattan chair with her bare feet pulled up . She was flushed and shining , and she waved her cigarette like an actress . I never saw her smoke any other time , before or since . <p> Now that I 'm old enough to stay up , they 're a lot more careful . They pay me and Foley 's sister Annie to take care of the little kids , which means staying upstairs and watching Pocohontas or Beauty and the Beast until bedtime , but I still see a lot of what goes on . Annie calls it Party Night when they decide to get wasted , and you can always tell , because they start out in the afternoon , playing old swing tunes or Tex-Mex on the boom box . After supper somebody , usually Annie 's folks , starts dancing in the living room . My dad does n't dance , but sometimes my mom and Aunt Terri do the swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , Annie and I were looking forward to Party Night last summer , because we had a plan to sneak some tequila when all the grownups were too drunk to notice . Annie is a year younger than me and she goes to Immaculate Conception , but she 's always getting ideas like that . The girls at I.C. have a wild reputation . <p> I 've dug out all the photos of me and Foley on the Fairy Whip . In the later ones , I 'm still smiling , but I 'm looking at Foley , like I 'm trying to reassure him that it 's fun . Because that 's the thing : if my mom or Foley 's mom or any of them had ever really looked at those photos from year to year , they 'd have seen it was mean to put him on that ride , even with me to take care of him . An ordinary kid figures out what to expect after the first time . Foley never got it . It was just one scary surprise after another for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's not crying anymore in those later pictures ; he just looks more bewildered every time . The only reason he wanted to go every year was because it was the first ride when you came in the door , and he forgot how it scared him . Plus I think he liked it when I held him . <p> It 's a pain to try to find anything on my dad 's videotapes , because he just shoots at anything , with no rhyme or reason . When you get to the beach tapes , it 's really gross , too , because my dad always tries to slip in pictures of girls in bikinis , especially if they have big boobs . <p> There 'll be a shot of Foley and me and Foley 's dad building a sand castle , and the camera will shift around , so right behind us there 's a picture of somebody 's butt or their boobs . Sometimes on the boardwalk , you can see the girls act disgusted to have some old lecherous guy point his camera down their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What 's even grosser is that he tries to be sneaky , to make us think he 's really watching us , and not noticing that somebody 's bulging out of her bikini . One time at Playland he and my mom had a fight about it , or my mom did , anyway . " I know what you 're doing , Boyd . You 're not fooling anybody with that stupid camcorder . " My dad does n't fight . He just looks like pained innocence and denies it . This was after he was pretending to video us in the bumper cars but really shooting some motorcycle lady who had a snake tattoo drooping out of her halter top . My dad does n't have very good taste , either , which is another thing that makes my mother mad . She wo n't let him video her in a bathing suit , even though it 's a one-piece and she looks fine , except for a little tummy . <p> I finally did find a video with us on the Fairy Whip . It 's from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blossoms and the track and everything look much smaller than I remember them , of course . My dad , as usual , picked the wrong place to stand , so instead of seeing our faces as we 're being whirled around the corners , all you see is us going back and forth in the straight parts . <p> By that time , Annie was riding too . She always rode by herself , and every time you see her going by , she 's yelling her head off and leaning way forward , like she 's trying to make the flower go faster . Foley and I are in the blossom behind . Foley looks stunned , like someone just smacked him and he does n't know why . I look like my mom . This is weird , I know . I do n't really look like her . I have her body , I guess , but in my face and my coloring I take after my dad . What I mean is , in the video I do two things exactly like her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror at the far end of the track , I turn and check out how I look , just the way my mom does . I have her exact same expression on my face , kind of critical , but secretly admiring , too . The second thing is , except for that instant when I look at myself in the mirror , I 'm looking at Foley the whole time . Which is how my mom is with my dad , or how she thinks she ought to be , giving him all this attention and support so he 'll do what she wants , which is to work hard and take care of us . <p> In the video , I 've got my arms around Foley , and I 'm talking to him like he 's really brave and he 's having fun and I need him to tell me it 's safe and not to be afraid . " Oooh , Foley , that was great ! Here it comes again . Get ready ! Hold on to me ! Do n't let me fall ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video , of course . I can just see it on my face . All you can hear on the video is yelling and the music from the carousel and the racket from the other rides . Somebody in the background , I think it 's my Aunt Terri , says " Boyd ! Over here ! " A couple of times my dad says " Chase ! Chase ! " trying to get my attention , but I never look his way . <p> As soon as Annie 's dad , Phil , put on his Flaco Jimanez CD , we knew it was Party Night . Annie checked out the booze and found two bottles of Cuervo Gold on the kitchen counter , plus rum and a lot of other stuff . We 'd had Foley and the little kids out on the beach all day , playing their brains out , so we knew there 'd be no problem getting them to bed . All through supper Annie kept giving me the eye like this was going to be so easy , and I thought she was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and none of them was into crabbing about our table manners , not even my mom . <p> The little kids were out even faster than we thought . They did n't even last through Aladdin . Foley did n't budge the whole time , because that movie is his favorite . He really likes the genie . <p> I was for waiting until the movie was over and we were sure all the adults were out on the porch before we went downstairs , but Annie said we 'd better sneak down to the kitchen while they were n't expecting us . I said no , but she just kept getting more and more antsy until she finally said she was going to do it whether I came along or not , and I could stay and watch kiddy videos with Foley if I wanted . <p> I did n't feel like staying with Foley by myself He was still pretty much the same old dopey , lovey Foley , but lately he 'd been starting to rub up against me , and I knew what he wanted , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was to go down the back stairs and sneak into the kitchen through the back door . Annie would pour the tequila into her water bottle while I kept watch . If anybody came in , we 'd say we were just raiding the cookie bin . <p> Outside was shivery ; my mom would 've made me wear a sweatshirt if she knew I was going out . Our bare feet flickered down the shadows of the back stairs . The thump of the boom box and the splashes of laughter seemed far away . Annie swung the screen door and my spine quivered like the spring . She hung there for the longest time . " Well ? " I whispered . <p> " Maybe we should wait . " Annie does that sometimes . She 's all hot to do something , then she loses her nerve at the last minute . I 'm more like , once you start something , you might as well go through with it . <p> " Let me go first . " I eased the door open and slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a moan . At first I thought somebody was hurt . At first I thought it was my Aunt Terri , because our legs are all the same , hers , mine and my mom 's . All I saw was her skirt hiked to the waist and the gleam of her leg , shaven all slick , wrapped around Phil 's leg , and her arms around his neck . The skirt dropped like a shadow as they lurched apart . I smelled my mom . I 'm almost as tall as her now , and I can always smell her hair . Even through the tequila and sweaty Phil . Even through the disgusting smell of her wanting him . I felt like throwing up . I felt like smacking her . Even now , I feel like crying . <p> Phil cleared his throat . " Are n't you girls supposed to be in bed ? " Which we were n't . It was only nine-thirty . <p> Then Annie ... , sometimes she 's so dumb . She goes " we just came down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We all squinted at the glare , but in that instant I saw Phil , all clammy and slack in the face , like Foley when he wants to rub against me . He blinked at my mom like he was surprised to see her . My mom looked away , and her hands shook as she tucked in her blouse . <p> " We were just getting a drink , " she said . " Would you girls like a soda ? " Just like that . It was so lame and pathetic . Grownups get caught doing the grossest , most disgusting thing they could ever do , and they act like it can all be smoothed over by being polite . Just then my dad walked in . <p> " Shelly . . . ? " He finally got it . Even my dead-brain dad , going around with his camcorder stuck to his face , even without seeing as much as Annie and I saw , he figured out what had been going on . I could n't see his face in the dim kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even look at Phil . " Is there any more ice ? " Then , as if he were seeing Annie and me for the first time , " what are you girls doing up ? " <p> Foley and Annie 's folks are getting a divorce . My mom told me about it after school one day , as she was driving me to figure skating . " How come ? " I asked , and she knew what I was getting at . <p> " They do n't love each other anymore . " She almost missed the exit to the parkway , and a truck honked at her when she swerved over at the last minute . She glared like she wanted to give him the finger , but she did n't . " Oh , I suppose they still love each other , in some ways , but they just ca n't live together anymore . I do n't know , exactly . " <p> " Are you and dad getting a divorce ? " I ca n't believe I asked that , but I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mad . She pretended she was n't expecting the question . " No , honey , what makes you think that ? " " What 's Phil going to do ? " <p> She started concentrating on the traffic . " Phil 's getting a condo in town , I think . Peggy 's keeping the house . " She started to pat my knee in the dopey , useless way she does , but then she caught hold of it and squeezed . " Your dad and I just had some hard times , honey . We 're not going to break up . " <p> I guess I knew that . After that night at the beach house my dad moped around all day , but he did n't say anything . My mom acted like she was mad at him , instead of the other way around . Phil went up to Rehoboth to look at some property , and then he had business , so he never came back to the beach the rest of the time we were there . For almost a week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even come along when we played miniature golf . I think my aunts sided with Annie 's mother , so it was like everyone was against my mom , but she stuck it out , she was so stubborn . If she 'd had the camera , I bet she would 've cut their heads off and showed their big behinds in every shot . <p> Finally , a couple of days before we were supposed to go home , they made up . We had the kids and Foley down on the beach . My dad came down to swim , and he spent a long time out beyond the breakers , stroking hard , back and forth , like he was trying to get in shape to get a new wife . I was sure they were going to get a divorce . When he came back out , my dad looked exhausted . He slumped on a rock at the edge of the breakwater . After awhile my mom came along , in her one-piece black bathing suit and a ball cap with her hair sticking out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the two of them were riding double on a horse . She rubbed his back but he did n't look around . I could n't tell if they were talking . After awhile she hugged him , resting her cheek on the back of his neck . He patted her knee . That afternoon they drove off by themselves and did n't come back until after supper . My dad was almost like his old self . My mom did n't look happy or unhappy , but there was n't that tension with my aunts anymore . <p> I think about that when I look at those photos of Foley and me on the Fairy Whip . There 's not much to that ride at all , just a couple of quick turns that whirl you around at either end of the straight-away . They 're not even that great once you learn to expect them . You have to distract yourself , look in the mirror or look at your partner , so they 'll come as more of a surprise . <p> Annie 's staying with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she might , she 's been acting up so much since her folks decided to get divorced . They sent Foley to a special school near Wilmington . The last time I got to see him was in April , at his 16th birthday party . My mom dropped me off at their house , but did n't come in . Phil was there . He brought Foley a bike , but they did n't know whether Foley would be able to take it with him when he went to the new school . Foley was n't his usual dopey , lovey self either , because he had n't seen his dad in awhile , so he was way too loud and laughing too much and wanting to show off . He ate a bunch of sweet stuff , too , so he was extra hyper , and by the time the party was over , he was back in a slump . <p> I just gave him one hug before I had to go , but I squeezed him extra tight , like we were really having fun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me not to be afraid and hold on to me and not let me fall . <p>
