<p> It 's gardening time at Edna Maguire Elementary School in Mill Valley . Teacher 's aide April Green and a group of first-graders are admiring a vegetable bed they planted earlier . <p> A little boy pulls up a radish that has split . " Why did it split ? " he asks . " Let 's take it inside later and we 'll talk about it , " Green says . <p> " What is this ? " Green asks , pointing to a leafy plant . " Oh ! Oh ! Oh " squeals one little girl hopping up and down . " Spinach ! " <p> Today 's lesson is planting wildflowers . " Pick out a spot and rough it up , " Green says , distributing kid-size rakes . " Then come to me and I 'll give you some seed . It 's going to be hard work . " <p> But roughing things up comes naturally to first-graders and the rakes are busy . <p> Green watches with a bemused look . " Working with kids , I really had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're weeding and start pulling up the plant . But they love it . " <p> Green is one of several master gardeners  --  trained horticultural volunteers  --  working at Edna Maguire School . <p> The master gardener program is a national volunteer organization sponsored by local agricultural cooperative extension offices . Trained volunteers staff hotlines to answer the public 's gardening questions , run booths at fairs and hold clinics to identify pests , diseases and other problems , as well as undertake special projects . The Bay Area boasts programs in Marin , Sonoma , Alameda and Contra Costa counties . <p> FOR KIDS ONLY <p> In Marin and Sonoma , for example , master gardeners are involved in such special projects as a Point Reyes restora- tion project and a community garden in Santa Rosa , says Ellie Rilla , director of the Marin/Sonoma master gardener programs . Another project is the restoration of a historic garden at Audubon Canyon Ranch 's Cypress Grove . <p> And then there 's the educational garden at Edna Maguire School . The school was closed for several years while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it was used by a group helping adults with learning disabilities . They planted an organic garden as a horticultural therapy program . <p> When the school reopened last year , teachers and parents , including Green , persuaded the school to let them take over the garden as an educational tool . " They gave us one year to make it fly , " Green recalls . <p> That 's when Green signed up for the master gardener program . " I was sort of an oddity , " says Green , 42 . " I was already involved in a project . I was already putting in a lot more than 25 hours a week . " <p> But she found the program to be a perfect match . " I had gardened all my life but I had no formal training . When you 've been doing something for a long time without formal training , and someone helps organize something you 've had pieces of for such a long time , it 's such a joy . <p> " We use the garden across the curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For example , last fall the kids used the pumpkin patch as still lifes for their art class . When they sell the produce , the children polish their math as they learn to make change . And planting is treated as a scientific experiment in which the students learn to make observations , keep records and test hypotheses . <p> Each class has a 17-by-5-foot plot where they do organic gardening and composting . The garden showed a small profit last year from produce sales , which benefit the school . <p> Most of the supplies are donated . Green Gulch Farms , for example , provides plants . And Smith &; Hawken gave bulbs and garden equipment . " We have the Mercedes-Benz of tools , " Green says . <p> The master gardener programs in Marin and Sonoma , says Rilla , are run entirely by volunteers . " It 's a pretty popular program , " she says . " We 're not able to take everyone . That 's the only down side of the program . People are volunteering and you 're turning them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications for 30 slots . " <p> LAGUNA HONDA <p> Although San Francisco does n't have a master gardener program , master gardeners are still active in the city . Volunteers , for example , keep up a garden for the hospice and AIDS unit of Laguna Honda Hospital . Laureen Elizabeth , 45 , a Marin master gardener , helped start the flower garden in 1989 . <p> " It was a neglected part of the garden , " says Elizabeth , who now coordinates the effort . " We cleaned it up , fertilized and mulched to where it is now  --  a visually beautiful place to be . It 's well used by staff , volunteers , patients and their families . " <p> The garden is n't really designed for hands-on participation by the patients , though it 's a feature Elizabeth hopes to offer in the future . <p> " I 've had some patients come out while I was planting bulbs to supervise . There 's a great deal of interest on the part of the patients . Most can see the garden from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light up when I bring flowers to their bedside . " <p> ALAMEDA COUNTY TOMATO TRIALS <p> In Alameda County , master gardeners help around the agricultural extension office , answer calls , staff exhibits at various garden shows , run demonstration gardens and produce a bimonthly TV show , says Richard Molinar , horticulture adviser . <p> They also participate in research projects , such as the tomato trials that the Alameda cooperative extension holds each year . Master gardeners help plant and harvest 30 to 40 different varieties and write summaries on which grows best , yields best and tastes best , Molinar says . <p> But the most visible project is " Magic in the Garden , " a monthly TV show on United Artists Cable Channel ( a public access channel in the Hayward area ) that the master gardeners have produced themselves for three years . <p> They do everything , Molinar says , " camerawork , graphics , switching and directing . Everything . " The 30-minute show , which airs at 6 p.m. on the second and fourth Wednesday of the month , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking care of your lawn . <p> Alameda County has trained 320 master gardeners since the program started in 1981 . Usually , about 45 master gardeners are trained each year , with double that number turned away , " partly on a first-come , first-served basis . " <p> But this year , there wo n't be a class in Alameda County . Because of budgetary cuts , Molinar is testing a new system in which Alameda and Santa Clara counties alternate years to hold the class . This year , Molinar is referring applicants to Santa Clara County . <p> Master gardener Jack Schwegmann , 67 , has manned Alameda 's gardening hotline every Tuesday and Thursday for three years . <p> " I 've put in 2,500 hours of public service since 1988 , " he says . " The majority of what I do is talk to people about what problems they have . I encourage them to bring specimens in so I can see what I 'm talking about . Once in awhile , I go out with farm advisers and cover field problems . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a professional plant pathologist before he retired . " You 're never so smart you ca n't learn something . While I had lived here over 20 years , my knowledge of local problems was relatively small . " <p> CONTRA COSTA <p> In addition to training volunteers , the Contra Costa program offers vocational training and makes a special effort to include minorities . <p> Some make house calls to senior citizens to help identify and correct plant problems . In Richmond , says Demetrios G. Kontaxis , farm adviser , " quite a few minority master gardeners are working at ornamental nurseries . " And the City of Pittsburg employs many in their public works department . <p> " The employers are very cooperative . They pay people to attend the master gardener program . " <p> The county , Kontaxis says , has several major nurseries that are looking for master gardeners to hire . So far , seven or eight have found jobs there . The program started in 1982 with just 15 to 20 people and grew to almost 100 last year . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Richmond to reach minorities . But this year , things are different . Kontaxis is semi-retired and has no time to manage two classes , so only one class will be held this year in Pittsburg . <p> Enrollment was limited to 50 people but was quickly expanded to 60 . " There was such a response that we took on extra just in case a few dropped out , " says Tina Soewardie , master gardener and horticulturist for the City of Pittsburg . <p> The City of Pittsburg finances the nonprofit Environmental Services Center , which provides facilities for the master gardeners program and headquarters for parks personnel . The city also pays interested parks department personnel to attend the master gardener classes . Currently the parks department has five master gardener graduates , with eight more in the current class . <p> One graduate is Alvin Bell of Pittsburg , who became a master gardener last year . <p> " I was working through the City of Pittsburg in park maintenance , mostly doing weed control and maintenance , " says Bell , 30 , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up during a seminar he was attending and " it sounded like something I could use . " <p> The course , he says , taught him a lot about pest control and plant identification . " I 've been seeing them , but I never knew their names , " he said , " until I became a master gardener . " <p> SPECIAL PROJECTS <p> Master gardeners have undertaken two major projects at the Environmental Center : an edible landscape and a wildflower garden . <p> Lisa Jang of Lafayette designed the edible landscape and six or seven other master gardeners did the planting . Again , seeds and supplies were donated . <p> Jang , a 23-year-old UC Berkeley student , saw an article about master gardeners and decided to join up . <p> " I 'll never stop . The Environmental Center has a wonderful greenhouse where they do a lot of work with high school kids in Pittsburg . I think that does a lot of good for everyone . It brings community closer together . " <p> HISTORY <p> The master gardener program started in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Marin/Sonoma master gardener programs . The population was growing so fast that cooperative extension agents could not do their traditional one-on-one counseling with the public any longer . They needed help . <p> The answer was to give volunteers a short but intense course in horticulture so they could assist the agents . In exchange for four months of free training , participants promise 50 volunteer hours over the next year . <p> For information on becoming a master gardener , call your county cooperative extension office . <p> RESOURCES <p> If you have a question about gardening , call the master gardeners at these University of California cooperative extension offices . <p> * Alameda : Call ( 510 ) 670-5200 , 10 a.m. to noon and 1 to 3 p.m .
