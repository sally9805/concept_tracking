HORMONES GET BLAMED FOR JUST ABOUT EVERY ADolescent foible , so here 's another to add to the list : teenagers may stay up later than younger kids because of physical changes during puberty , a study in the journal Sleep suggests . Until now , researchers ( and certainly parents ) assumed that night-owl adolescents were either being rebellious or pressured by friends . But a study of 458 sixth-graders , controlled for some social factors , found that students who were more physically mature chose to go to bed later than those just entering puberty . The same students also slept later on weekends than their prepubescent peers . The conclusion : puberty 's biological changes may trigger an adjustment in kids ' internal clocks , keeping them alert till the wee hours . Next hypothesis : it 's hormones that make teens gab endlessly on the phone .
