<p> There was a time when baseball owners did own the players , in every sense of the word . The game was less corporate , less lucrative , far less exposed . <p> Players were paid handsome wages , but they were the wages of a workingman , not royalty . It was the time of indentured servitude , with management holding all the cards and dealing them as it saw fit . <p> The game of baseball has changed , that much can go unchallenged . But how much , and in what ways ? Is baseball losing its sense of history amid dueling forces of corporate ownership and multimillionaire ballplayers ? <p> The Sporting Green called on three former ballplayers  --  each a San Francisco native , each a prominent figure from a different era  --  and asked them for their ideas about the state of the game , past and present . <p> EDDIE JOOST <p> A longtime player and short-time manager , 77-year-old Eddie Joost played in the big leagues from 1936-1955 and was player- manager of the Philadelphia Athletics in 1954 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1949 , when he hit .263 with 23 homers and 81 RBIs for the Athletics . He lives in a retirement community near Santa Rosa . <p> Yeah , we had a tough time . We were persecuted . We were not free . We were chattel . But you know what ? We liked what we were doing . <p> It was as good as anything you could do in those days , and we were making a lot more money than a lot of people were making back then . I looked at it this way : Playing ball gave me a freedom I would not have had if I had just gone to high school and then to work . <p> I really and truly think these guys are not only privileged , but they should realize the fans are the ones who make the game , and the ones who keep the game going . If they lose sight of that , there wo n't be baseball . <p> The fans are being lost in all this . The players say , " We do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In my opinion , they 're leaving the fans out of it . <p> It 's not like when we played . Back then , the club owners were families  --  that was their business , that was how they made their living . I played in the Pacific Coast League , and the owners of those clubs made their money buying and selling players . That 's why I call us " chattel . " Not " cattle " but " chattel . " You could not make it to the big leagues in less than three or four years back then . That 's how those Coast League teams made money , buying and selling players , so they did n't sell a player until they were sure the guy was ready to stay up there . <p> I think that a fella who pays $ 100 million for a ballclub has a right to make a profit , and the players need to understand that . The unknown quantity is where the money is coming from and where it 's going to , and I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary cap , that 's another issue . By my way of thinking , the owners created that themselves . <p> Sometimes I do n't think the players realize how good they 've got it , and I do n't really blame them ; it 's the way it is . But we had to buy all our own equipment  --  shoes , shirts , gloves , jockstraps  --  we had to buy everything on our own . They gave you the uniform and that was it . They had complete control over your destiny , too , but we did n't even think about it . Most of us were just happy to have the freedom to play ball and get paid for it . <p> I think players take things for granted . A lot of them say , " We need to raise the minimum from $ 110,000 to $ 175,000 . " That 's a lot of money . You 'd like to be making that kind of money and so would I. And we would n't be yelling and screaming about it . <p> My opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizer . He 's a union man , and things are n't going to change . Ravitch is trying to find out , as he says , what do they want ? It 's going to be a hassle because you have two guys who are not going to give in . <p> The fans are the ones who are n't thought about here . If it were n't for the fans , there would n't be baseball . I think that 's changed since I played . Sure , there are more people now . When we played , during the week prices would be like two dollars , and we 'd get only about 1,500 or 2,000 people . The only way they survived in those days was weekends and holidays . Those were the only big crowds . <p> The way baseball was in those days , there were six or seven guys on a ballclub who were equally as good . Now you have one or two . I have no animosity toward the game . I walked off ( as a manager ) because I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a manager anymore , and I had to have a say . <p> I do n't go out to the ballpark every day , but I keep up with it . I 've found that when you go , you become a critic . I remember Stan Musial told me , when I was living in Hawaii about 15 or 20 years ago , that he considered 40 percent of the players in the major leagues at that time could n't play in the big leagues when we were there . <p> And now with expansion . . . it 's become a big business . Before you could go up and sit down and talk with the owner and the general manager one on one . It was n't like it is now , where it 's , " Here 's a lawyer , here 's a lawyer , take care of it . " <p> Sometimes I do n't understand it . <p> . <p> FRANK CROSETTI <p> There are n't many baseball people who can boast the kind of brand loyalty that marked Frank Crosetti 's career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1932 , a teammate of Ruth , Gehrig and Dickey , and spent more than 30 years with the Yankee organization . A shortstop , he played for 17 years , then went into coaching . As a player , he participated in the World Series seven times . He is 83 years old and lives in Stockton . <p> Who 's right or who 's wrong in this ? I do n't know who 's right or who 's wrong . Everybody 's blaming the owners  --  the writers are , the fans are  --  but maybe it 's the players . I do n't know , though . I do n't understand it . <p> I can say this : This arbitration deal , where you take a .250 hitter who 's making a hundred thousand or a couple hundred thousand bucks , and he wants a raise , so you have this arbitrator  --  I do n't know , who are these people ? He does n't know anything about baseball , and he gives the guy a million and a half . I do n't blame the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the players should realize that . <p> One other thing : There are some of these older players who failed to make the pension when it started in 1947 . If there 's all this money out there , why do n't they come back and pick them up , put them in the pension ? <p> If there 's so much money out there , what would it hurt to give them some of it , take care of some of the older guys ? Some of them were good ballplayers , too , and they made five or seven thousand bucks a year back when they played . Instead of giving some of these guys now $ 5-6 million a year , bring some of these other guys in . Then baseball would be doing something good . They do n't want to do that , though , because these players want it all for themselves . <p> If they took these guys  --  I think there 's 218 of them , by what I read last year  --  and give ' em something . A couple hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing to these guys . <p> With all these millions out there , you mean they could n't back up and pick up these 218 guys ? Why be selfish ? Why not do something good ? I 'm sure they could sit down and figure out how much money these guys should get . <p> Nobody says anything about the old-timers , and I know people think , " Oh , the old guys are always complaining , " but I have n't read one thing about these guys who did n't get in for the pension . Not one thing . Aw , well , I think the world 's upside-down anyway . <p> The owners could do something about this ; they would have to take the bull by the horns and say , ' Listen , this is what we 're going to do . ' But they wo n't do it . There are all these new owners out there , and they have their own thing , too . <p> I do n't know that the game was better back in my day . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves , I 'll tell you that . I tell people , " I do n't think I could make the plays they 're making . " It 's really something to watch . They make some sensational catches . <p> I think the coaching is better now , though . Back when I played we had two coaches on a club , one hit infield and the other in the bullpen . We were n't really told anything . They tell these kids more today , but what I think is wrong today is the way they do n't get enough experience in the minor leagues . <p> Years ago , you had to wait your turn to make it . Now a guy hits a long hard foul and  --  boom !  --  he 's up . Then he does n't do well right away and  --  boom !  --  he 's back down . Then he hits another loud foul and he 's back up . I think it would be frustrating as hell for a player . I say let them stay down and get the experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . It 's the only game that 's any good , as far as I 'm concerned . <p> . <p> DOLPH CAMILLI <p> The National League 's Most Valuable Player in 1941 , first baseman Dolph Camilli played for 12 years in the big leagues . His best years , including 1941 , came with the Brooklyn Dodgers . He played for four teams , concluding his career in 1945 . Camilli , 87 , lives in San Mateo and spends a lot of time on the golf course . " I do n't play anymore , " he said . " I hit a few balls on the range when nobody 's looking , then I go feed the geese . " <p> The players do n't know how well off they are . When I played , you took what the damned owners gave you . Sure , you tried to fight them and get more , but it did n't work . A lot of us , no matter how good you were , had to go to work in the winter . Enos Slaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month . <p> I look at it now and think , ' How the hell could they let it happen ? ' Originally , the ballplayers were being mistreated ; now it 's the owners . And I used to be a players ' guy all the way  --  all the way . Now I think they 're a bunch of spoiled brats . I do n't like the way they show up the opposition ; the old- time players would n't have put up with that for a minute . <p> This strike all comes down to the old saying again : Greed . It 's greedy ballplayers and greedy owners . And you know who 's taking the beating ? The fans . I 'm for the fans in this one . <p> What they 've done to baseball  --  most other games could n't survive it . They ca n't kill baseball , because it 's too great a game . <p> These players think the game ca n't do without them . I 've got news for them : They 're here on a short-term basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take their place , and it wo n't affect the game one bit . <p> This free agency caused a lot of the problems . There 's no loyalty . Fans get attached to a player , and he 's playing for somebody else the next year . Take Will Clark , he was a hero . Now he 's gone . Brett Butler is another one . <p> The salaries go up because one owner wants a certain player , so he 's bidding against another owner . They end up giving them money they never should have had in the first place . <p> And the game sure was n't played any worse back when we played . I can walk out of the ballpark and name you six or seven things they screwed up because of poor execution or poor coaching . I 'm not impressed by the coaching these days . I made a remark to Tommy Lasorda one time . I asked him , " What the hell do you guys do in spring training ? " <p> Most of my salaries were between $ 6,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in 1941 ) and I went to ( Larry ) MacPhail and said I wanted $ 25,000 . He said , " I 'll give you $ 24,500 , and the extra $ 500 comes only if you take care of the pitching staff . " I guess that was so I would keep hitters from getting to the pitcher if a fight broke out . With MacPhail , no matter what you asked , he was going to take something off . <p> We did n't have agents , of course , and I 'm against the agents . I think they 're the ones who are causing the trouble . I think Donald Fehr is the one who screwed up baseball with his iron grip , and the players listen to him . <p> These guys today should be doing things to please the fans , but they do n't . When they come back , I say do n't go . Close the damned place . Let ' em play a month before empty stands and see what they think then . <p> Who 's to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe the money these guys are making . Nobody 's worth that kind of money . I do n't care if they 're athletes or anyone else . They do n't need those millions . Who the hell is worth $ 3 million , in any line of work ? <p> If a guy 's Joe DiMaggio or Ted Williams , he could go up to $ 200,000 , but that would be the most . That 's my answer . <p> I missed the pension by one year . Cheap bastards the players are , they did n't go back and pick up the old ballplayers . They boast about how they take care of the old destitute ballplayers , but why wait until they 're destitute ? To get help , they ca n't own a house or have any savings or anything . Then they 'll take care of them , when they 're dying . What a big help that is . <p> Most of these guys now , if they could n't play ball , they 'd have to get a lunch bucket . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should get down on their knees and thank the Lord . <p> But listen , the game is great . Nothing will change baseball . If there are two guys left on Earth , they 'll be playing baseball .
