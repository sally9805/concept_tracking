Why do novelists like to stereotype American entrepreneurs as single-minded and heartless ? Perhaps because so many are . Herman Melville set the tone in 1857 with The Confidence-Man . Mark Twain later brought the national style of go-getting to popular perfection in Huckleberry Finn . An adult rereading of that masterpiece reveals a hierarchy of hustlers , from runaway slave Jim and his fortune-telling hair ball to the outlandish charlatans calling themselves the King and the Duke . <P> At the other literary extreme , Horatio Alger 's heroes triumphed through trustworthiness , diligence and stupefying practicality . As usual , the truth about the business world lies somewhere between comic cynicism and Rotarian sentimentality , in a psychological wilderness area now artfully surveyed by Steven Millhauser 's Martin Dressler : The Tale of an American Dreamer ( Crown ; 294 pages ; $24 ) . <P> Set in New York City at the turn of the century , this tale of a young man , a real-estate dreamer , embodies both the realities and the fantasies of a growing nation infatuated with its own possibilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display that makes the 5 ' cigars in his father 's tobacco shop look more expensive . As a teenage bellhop , he boosts sales at a hotel concession . In 1894 at the age of 22 , he opens the Metropolitan Lunchroom and Billiard Parlor , a winning concept that is expanded northward into the newly developing acreage bordering Central Park . <P> Among the pleasures of Millhauser 's fourth novel , which continues in the author 's previous vein of treating American history with dreamlike obsession , are descriptions of Manhattan as it began to transform its landscape into a 20th century skyline : an eruption of " modern flowers with veins of steel , bursting out of bedrock . " It does not take a Viennese mind doctor to find eroticism in such charged imagery . Building cities is a procreative business , and Dressler is an evocative example of a breed driven to reproduce itself in concrete . A decision to marry a withdrawn woman of no discernible personality is a strong indication of his diverted passions . <P> In such respects Martin Dressler is an urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instincts in the service of progress . Yet this commercial hero also represents a period of social history when ambition and new wealth outstripped utility and taste . Dressler 's Grand Cosmo , an architectural and cultural Tower of Babel , is part residence and part theme park . Within its 30 stories and two subterranean levels are a beach , a lake , a model New England village , a Moorish bazaar and a simulated asylum for the insane . Criticized as an example of " the worst excesses of late Victorian eclecticism , " Dressler 's folly fails spectacularly , a case of too much too late . In the end Dressler completes the illusion and his ruination by hiring actors to play customers . <P> Turning real estate into a reflection of a mind that in turn mirrors a society is a tricky literary feat . Millhauser pulls it off by lowering the barriers between realism and myth . The effect is also to remove artificial distinctions between the entrepreneur and the artist .
