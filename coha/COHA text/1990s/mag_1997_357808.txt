In his backyard , ensconced in a cozy black leather armchair , Rabbi Philip Berg , 68 , is presiding over a hushed celebration of the Jewish harvest festival of Sukkoth . As the garden party proceeds , he remembers when he saw the Light . " When you meet your master , it takes but a minute , " says Berg , referring to the late , hallowed Kabbalist Yehudah Brandwein . " The Light simply turned on . " The enlightenment was passed on by marriage as well : Brandwein 's niece became Berg 's first wife . Since Berg met Brandwein in 1962 , the Brooklyn-born leader of the Kabbalah Learning Center has pursued a single mission : the dissemination of Kabbalah to mankind and , flouting Kabbalistic orthodoxy , to womankind too . He concedes , however , that such lofty aspirations require financial grounding : " I do n't know if you can reach 5 billion people with $5 in your pocket . " That approach is controversial , leading many to ask whether the real Berg is prophet or profiteer . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says believer Karen Erickson during the prayers , " because he 's doing it for the whole world . " Some students attribute near miraculous powers to Berg ; a former devotee , who prefers to remain anonymous , admits to having believed the Rav was the channel for God 's word . Berg has written the bulk of the works that make up the center 's core curriculum . That is a disturbing monopoly to critics who dispute Berg 's theology . Berg traces the center 's roots to two Israeli rabbis , the late Yehudah Ashlag and Brandwein . But Brandwein 's son Avraham denies any connection between the center and Brandwein 's legacy , and some scholars characterize Berg 's teachings as New Age perversions , a sort of Kabbalah Lite cooked up for Americans on the go . <P> Berg 's Kabbalah is heavier on the pocketbook . Classes are reasonable , as little as $10 , but costs escalate with the purchase of the center 's books and tapes . For example , its 24-volume edition of the Zohar , in Aramaic and Hebrew , sells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rabbi Michael Skobac , a consultant for Jews for Judaism , has received complaints of aggressive and unethical door-to-door solicitation by center teachers . In addition , some members report feeling squeezed for cash . " At the center , they say you can only make a difference when you give until it hurts , " says the former devotee . Berg firmly denies any coercion at the center ; cardiologist Artur Spokojny agrees , pointing out that he happily contributed $20,000 for a Torah scroll . " Giving is never something that I feel I have to do , " he says . " If that were the case , I 'd be outta there . " <P> But can students beat such a hasty retreat ? The Cult Hotline and Clinic in New York City has received a dozen complaints from family members concerned about their relatives ' overzealous commitment to the center . Students often spend Jewish holidays with Berg ; a few become hevra , volunteers who live and work at center facilities . " My husband took our daughters there , " says a Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' When you look into Rabbi Berg 's eyes , you see his soul , and he 's beautiful . ' I ask you , is that normal ?
