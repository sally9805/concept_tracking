Mothers &; Daughters : Healing the Patterns of Generations <p> Early one Sunday morning my four-year-old daughter , Veronica , was twirling around the bedroom , displaying her vibrant , plump body . Her face radiated total self-confidence . As Veronica finished dressing , she matter-of-factly queried , " Mommy , I 'm cute , are n't I ? " I smiled and hugged her . As Veronica hugged me back , she said , " Mommy , you 're cute , too ! " <p> I felt tears rushing to my eyes . They were tears of love , but also of remembered pain . I wished that my mother had accepted me as beautiful in my entirety , including my body . In Veronica 's mind , there was no question that her mommy was beautiful . In my mother 's mind , I would be beautiful only if I lost weight . <p> For the most part , my relationship with my mother has been loving . We have shared our interests in reading , sewing , cooking , and attending plays . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she has understood . But my weight has always been an area of conflict . <p> Perhaps that is because my mother has struggled with her own issues about body size . While I was growing up , she vacillated between not caring about her weight and needing to just lose X number of pounds . I soon realized that being chunky was n't okay . <p> As I grew older , life 's increasing demands and stresses pounded on my self-confidence . I started using food as a pacifier of my anxieties . As my weight shot up , I started to hear fat clichs and pleas from my mother : " Boys will never look at you if you 're fat " ; " You 'd look better in black " ; " You 'd be so pretty if you 'd only lose some weight " ; " Do n't eat too much " ; " You do n't need that ice cream " ; " If you would lose some weight , then you could wear clothes like your sisters wear . " <p> My mother tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family doctor , who prescribed a diet . She encouraged and advised me in all my weight-loss endeavors . She even steered me into my career as a dietitian , hoping that I could change my eating habits and lose weight . At the time I did it to please her , but as I began to study I found nutrition quite interesting . <p> Although my knowledge about nutrition increased with each degree , I continued to yo-yo up and down in my weight . <p> After graduate school I moved from Minnesota to California , where there were more job opportunities for me . I enjoyed the challenge of starting a new life , but I really missed my family . Once again , I started to use food to quell my anxieties and loneliness . <p> This time , however , I fought back before my bingeing got totally out of control . I joined the local health club , which had weight-lifting machines as well as aerobic classes . I also worked on eating more nutritious foods and cutting down on sweets . Gradually , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my body , lost some weight , and improved my eating habits . I felt healthier than I had for a long time . <p> Despite that , I still did n't have much self-confidence about my large body . Then I met Ignacio . Ignacio admired my round plumpness and viewed me as sexy and desirable . He helped me feel good about my body because he accepted and loved me as I was . When I felt depressed , sometimes I 'd talk about diets and losing weight . He would tell me that I was fine just as I was . Other times , he would try to tease me out of my mood by calling me his gordita ( little fat one ) or another silly name . He attempted to make me feel better , but ultimately , I needed to accept myself . <p> A few years after Ignacio and I were married , I became pregnant and our daughter , Veronica , was born . She came screaming and kicking into this world with a beautiful , plump 9-pound , 6-ounce body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies . I did n't worry about her body size until she became a toddler . That was when the specter of my old issues about fatness started to darken our mother-daughter relationship . <p> By the age of two , Veronica was a round-faced , plump Campbell kid . She was the mirror image of myself at that age , which created a sense of dj vu when I looked at her . <p> Around that time I read a research paper on the development of obesity in children . It said there was a strong relationship between the weights of mothers and daughters . If the mother was large , the child was more likely to be large . It also found that fat preschool children were at risk of becoming fat teenagers . I started to worry about Veronica 's future . Would it be similar to mine ? The ugly clothes , the rejections , and the people who hurt me more than helped ? To my horror , I caught myself admonishing her with my mother 's words . <p> I blamed myself for Veronica 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had control of my weight , then Veronica would be slim . A few months later , while visiting my parents in Minnesota , the crowning blow fell . My mother and I were discussing my weight loss , and she said , " I always wondered how you could be credible as a dietitian when you were so fat . " I felt devastated . I did n't confront her or stand up for myself . I just felt awful . <p> I went back home with my mother 's words ringing in my ears . I spent a lot of time thinking about how my weight was still controlling my sense of self-esteem . I did n't want to spend my life living from diet to diet . I did n't want to poison Veronica 's positive view of her body and herself . I especially did n't want Veronica to waste time having self-doubts and continually dieting or thinking that she needed to . Finally , I did n't want to continue depending on my mother 's or other people 's opinions to validate my own sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with my insecurities and to nurture my relationship with Veronica . I realized that first I needed to pay more attention to myself . I had to clean up my own excess baggage ( past memories and fears ) and work on accepting myself as I was . I read everything that I could on developing a positive self-image . I did n't lose weight . Instead , I took every opportunity to nurture and feel good about me . I went for long walks and did special things for myself : I got facials and haircuts , bought clothes , and spent many quiet moments by myself . <p> I also worked to stretch my inner self . I actively pursued jobs and projects that interested me and explored new opportunities . As a dietitian , I have taught classes , published a newsletter , worked in research , written articles , and counseled clients . One of my most enjoyable experiences was teaching classes for a nearby health club . I loved teaching there because I was able to stress self-acceptance and making healthy food choices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy image , and my students and I had a wonderful time . Right now I divide my time between my family , volunteer work as a nutrition consultant at a Head Start program , and writing . <p> Veronica is now four years old , and I have tried to build a strong relationship with her . I focus on loving her for who she is , and I encourage her to explore new interests and new possibilities . <p> I have set certain goals for myself in relation to her . I do n't expect to always succeed , but I am going to do my best . Here are some of my goals : <p> 1 To give Veronica a strong sense of herself . To help her identify and develop her strengths and learn to be patient with herself as she practices what is more difficult for her . To give her some space so that she can explore on her own , too . <p> A few weeks ago our family went to the park . Veronica was fearlessly climbing jungle gyms and swooshing down steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on her rear at the bottom . Ignacio said , " Are you okay ? " After determining that she was fine , he said , " You really came off that slide fast . Good thing that you have a little extra padding back there . " Veronica giggled , and then triumphantly marched over to the spiral slide and climbed up again . Ignacio 's example continues to encourage me in my parenting goals . <p> 2 To help her feel emotionally strong . Crying and other expressions of all feelings are allowed and encouraged . <p> 3 To help Veronica develop tenacity . I would like her to always try , even if others say that she wo n't be able to do something . After a good try , however , she can reassess the situation , pat herself on the back for trying , and then move forward or go in another direction . My past tenacity has helped me to achieve many things that I value in life , and I want to pass this on to her . <p> 4 To teach her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny herself , nor does she need to feel unworthy in any way . I encourage her , instead , to live life to its fullest and to shoot for the sky in her dreams . <p> 5 To expose Veronica to a wide variety of activities  --  in sports , literature , music , and other areas . Ignacio and I have very different tastes in music , so Veronica is exposed to a lot of different styles , including ranchera and salsa . <p> We all love baseball , so whenever possible , we participate in or watch games . And I 'm encouraging Ignacio to teach Veronica how to play his favorite sport  --  soccer . I think that she definitely displays the spunk and instincts to be a good player . Veronica and I do a lot of walking , an activity that we have both enjoyed since she was very young . <p> 6 To assist her in putting food in its proper perspective . Food should nourish the body and please the palate . Veronica and I are working on being more open to trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will amaze me by telling me what new food she tried that day . Her ending statement is usually , " And Mommy , it was really good ! " <p> 7 Finally , to learn from Veronica about how to be a mother who helps her daughter feel good about herself  --  a mother who supports rather than obstructs , who encourages rather than limits , and who loves her child for who she is rather than what she or others would like her to be . <p> As I go into the living room for a short writing break , I glance at Veronica , who is mimicking the gyrating movements of a dance troupe on TV . She stops gyrating to inquire , " Mommy , I really dance good , huh ? " I reply , " Yes , Veronica , you really do ! " <p> As for my relationship with my mother , it is still loving . I have always admired my mother 's independence and emotional strength , and I hope to pass those qualities on to Veronica . But we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways , we 're like two boxers tensely circling each other before the start of a match . We 're both waiting to see who will be the first to shake hands . <p> I did detect a slight softening in my mother 's attitude when we last spoke long distance . I told her about RADIANCE and how the articles promoted a positive self-image and discussed the accomplishments of large women . She surprised me by saying that it sounded great . She also commented that she knew many successful people who were large . I replied that being large did n't affect your knowledge or competence , even in health-related occupations . She agreed and mentioned a large nurse who was competent and had a wonderful rapport with her clients and their families . <p> After I hung up the phone , I found myself wishing that we could have settled our conflicts about weight once and for all . Unfortunately , a problem that spans more than thirty years ca n't often be taken care of in one conversation . <p> I still intend to have a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dietitian , and our past weight conflicts . I want to resolve those issues so that we can enjoy and nurture our relationship . Perhaps sharing this article with her will be a step in the right direction . <p> Article copyright Radiance . <p> Article copyright Radiance . <p>
