Section : Science &; Technology Hedy Lamarr , Hollywood sex goddess , was also a brilliant inventor . She got paid for her movies , but not for her invention . <p> THE SCENE : a dinner party at the Hollywood home of actress Janet Gaynor . The year : 1940 . Viennese actress Hedy Lamarr , one of the great sex symbols of all time , is making small talk with American film-score composer George Antheil . At the end of the evening , she exits quickly , scrawling her phone number in lipstick across the windshield of his car . The next day , he calls and she invites him to an intimate dinner at her Benedict Canyon retreat . <p> The prelude to a steamy Hollywood affair ? Sorry , this is a business magazine . The pair talked about technology . That night , over dinner , Lamarr and Antheil discussed the Nazi domination of Europe . Lamarr spoke from firsthand knowledge . Three years earlier she had fled Austria , largely out of dislike of her wealthy munitions tycoon husband , Friedrich ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person she also disliked the Nazis and all they stood for , and was glad to put an ocean between herself and Hitler . <p> As the evening wore on , Lamarr began outlining her idea for a sophisticated antijamming device for use in radio-controlled torpedoes . If this seems out of character for a 26-year-old film beauty , the fact is that not only did Lamarr possess a first-class mind but she also had listened to her husband 's dinner-table business discussions with customers for his armaments . After all , Fritz Mandl 's Hirtenberger Patronen-Fabrik had supplied much of the equipment Benito Mussolini used when his troops invaded Ethiopia in 1935 . <p> As Lamarr spoke that evening , Antheil lay sprawled out on her living room floor diagramming her ideas in a spiral notebook . Two years later Lamarr and Antheil were awarded a U.S. patent for a " secret communication system . " <p> The system devised by Lamarr and Antheil  --  known as frequency hopping  --  is now in extensive use in military communications . It works like this : A signal is broadcast over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to frequency at split-second intervals . The signal could carry spoken words or commands for a torpedo . A receiver , hopping between frequencies in synchrony with the transmitter , picks up the message . Would-be eavesdroppers hear only unintelligible blips . Attempts to jam the signal succeed only at knocking out a few small bits of it . So effective is the concept that it is now the principal antijamming device used in the U.S. government 's $25 billion Milstar defense communications satellite system . <p> Neither Lamarr nor Antheil ever received a nickel from their patent . Why ? As an inventor Lamarr was decades ahead of her time . Frequency hopping , which was never implemented by the War Department , did not come into use until 1962 , when Sylvania installed it on ships sent to blockade Cuba . That was three years after the Lamarr-Antheil patent expired and the rights to the invention fell into the public domain . <p> " I ca n't understand , " says Hedy Lamart in her unmistakable soft and lilting Austrian-accented voice , " why there 's no acknowledgment when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely hurting , Lamarr could use the money ( see box , p. 138 ) . <p> Does the U.S. patent system , which grants a 17-year exclusive monopoly on inventions to patent holders , penalize forward-thinking inventors ? Hedy Lamarr , now 75 , certainly is n't the first inventor to think so . Over the years , plenty of others have launched ideas well in advance of their full commercial potential , from the Wright brothers to less noteworthy inventors like Philo T. Farnsworth , who was granted a patent for the electronically focused picture tube in 1930 . Ohio mathematician Marian Chew was granted a patent in 1969 for a simple method of testing automobile exhaust . Her test is now used in emissions inspections in 32 states ; last year it was used over 100 million times . But Chew 's patent expired in 1986 , and she has never collected a cent in royalties . She has gone to court to try to get the state of California to pay a royalty on tests it conducted between 1984 and 1986 , but there are legal problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case on technical grounds . <p> There 's a moral here : In technology , as in other lines of business , it is n't enough to have a good product ; you have to be a hustler , too . Chester Carlson got rich from his invention of xerography only because he was willing to knock on more than 20 doors before a little Rochester company  --  later known as Xerox  --  acquired the technology . Gordon Gould waged a decades-long battle to win a patent for the laser he invented in 1957 , finally winning in 1987 . The Patent Office 's delay worked in his favor , since his invention , like Lamarr 's , was ahead of its time . So far Gould has made nearly $10 million from his laser , with the patent not set to expire until 2004 . <p> Lamarr , in contrast , was never a dogged advocate for her invention . She simply turned it over to the government for use in fighting the Nazi menace and went back to plying her trade as a movie star . <p> In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invention entirely to the screen star . Here 's the backdrop to the brainstorm . While her husband may have considered her merely decorative , Lamarr learned a bit about weapons design during her three-year marriage to arms manufacturer Fritz Mandl . An idea stuck with her . Naval attack ships frequently wasted multiple torpedoes on a single target when one might do . Good for hubby 's business , bad for his customers . That 's because unpredictable ocean currents , plus evasive actions by target ships , add up to many possible torpedo paths . One solution : radio-controlled torpedoes . The idea sounded good but was impractical because radios are so easily jammed . <p> But when Antheil credited the idea entirely to Lamarr , he was being somewhat modest . When Hedy Lamarr met Antheil at Janet Gaynor 's dinner party , she met exactly the right person to help develop her idea . Before coming to Hollywood , where he scored films like The Plainsman and In a Lonely Place , Antheil had spent several years as an avant-garde composer . His offbeat Ballet Mecanique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 synchronized player pianos , two electrically driven airplane propellers , four xylophones , four bass drums and a siren . When the first notes were struck , the wind from the propellers nearly blew listeners out of their seats . <p> Antheil understood instantly that synchronizing a series of split-second hops between radio frequencies would be no more difficult than synchronizing player pianos . As a matter of fact , the patent specifies the use of slotted paper rolls  --  similar to piano rolls  --  to synchronize the jumps in frequency in the transmitter and receiver . The number of frequencies proposed  --  88  --  matches precisely the number of keys on a piano . <p> Perhaps as important as Antheil 's assistance was a branch of the Commerce Department called the National Inventors Council . This was headed by Charles F. Kettering , research director for General Motors . The council was launched with much fanfare in 1940 to generate innovative ideas and inventions from the general public . Lamarr and Antheil sent in their idea in December 1940 and were subsequently encouraged to refine it into a patentable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phased out in 1974 ) generated over 625,000 suggestions and ideas from the public , though few became patents . <p> But neither Antheil nor Lamarr gave much thought to promoting their invention  --  it was , after all , their contribution to the war effort . In fact , it was n't until 1957 , when the same concept was developed independently by a couple of engineers at Sylvania 's Electronic System Division in Buffalo , N.Y. , that frequency hopping found an application . It was the Sylvania device , operated electronically rather than with piano rolls , that ultimately became a staple of secure military communications . However , subsequent patents in frequency hopping do refer to the Lamarr/Antheil patent as the generic patent . <p> Could Hedy Lamarr have played the patent game differently and earned a pile of royalties ? Possibly . The patent system is designed to protect intellectual property but also to get ideas off the drawing board and into the world . Lamarr and Antheil basically ignored their patent once they solved their problem .

" Never a letter , never a thank you , never money , " she says . " I do n't know . I guess they just take and forget about a person . " <p> In her Hollywood days , Hedy Lamart was often quoted as saying , " Any girl can be glamorous . All she has to do is stand still and look stupid . " Glamorous she was , but stupid she was n't . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Screen siren Hedy Lamarr , ca. 1940 Glamorous , yes .

She also declined to let us send a photographer . " I still look good , though , " she added during a lengthy phone chat . <p> Lamarr is hardly a recluse . She spends evenings playing cards with friends and watching movies on her VCR . " Jimmy Stewart just wrote me a picture card  --  To a wonderful girl , ' it said . And Rex Reed wants me to go to a party with him tonight . He 's in town . " <p> The daughter of a prominent Viennese banker , Lamart ( nee Hedwig Kiesler ) grew up a self-described enfant terrible .

They shared a 25-room hunting lodge in the Austrian Alps , were chauffeured around in one of nine cars and dined off gold plates . Lamarr broke off the marriage after three years . " I could n't be an object , " she says , sounding rebellious and spry at age 75 , " so I walked out . " <p> After abandoning Vienna in 1937 , she met film mogul Louis B. Mayer in London . Mayer paid her $500 to sign a seven-year contract with MGM , shipped her to Hollywood and rechristened her Hedy Lamarr . At her peak , in the Forties , she earned as much as $250,000 a picture , starring in such films as White Cargo , Samson and Delilah and Comrade X. Over two decades , she appeared in 9.5 films , starring with such immortals as Clark Gable , Claudette Colbert , Judy Garland and Spencer Tracy . <p> In 1942 Lamarr patented an antijamming radio and gave it to the U.S. government as her contribution to the war effort .

Howard Hughes once lent her a pair of chemists to help her develop a bouillon-like cube which , when mixed with water , would create a soft drink similar to Coca-Cola .

" You could n't live with a person , in those days , without being married , " she says . In a playful sendup of Greta Garbo 's oft misquoted line , Lamarr , who spoke to FORBES before Garbo 's death last month , said , " I did n't van , to be alone .
