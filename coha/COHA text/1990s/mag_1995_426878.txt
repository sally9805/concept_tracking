Section : News you can use <p> The shopping season is a groaning board of high-tech choices  --  and topping many a list will be a new personal computer . Nobody wants to pay too much . But is it possible to pay too little ? <p> Personal computers are major purchases , and looking for ways to trim the bottom line by $50 here and $100 there is natural . Yet the smartest strategy this season , painful as it may be to hear , is to splurge . Even for an entry-level system , like a 75-megahertz Pentium , you should think in terms of $2,000 , minimum , for a PC-and-monitor combination without a printer . For a midlevel , 100MHz system , you 're talking at least $3,500 , with a printer . To ignore this advice invites frustration a year or less down the road , when your hard drive is full or you 're out of patience with the bargain-priced but fuzzy monitor . <p> Unlike televisions , air conditioners and other appliances , the differences from one model year to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Windows 95 changing the operating system that controls 80 to 90 percent of the computers sold , the difference is fundamental . <p> Windows 95 performs best and with the fewest glitches on machines designed for it  --  which is why you should not even consider purchasing a new 486 or Pentium that comes with Windows 3.1 and installing Windows 95 on it , no matter how appealingly low the price . If your needs are both modest and guaranteed not to grow , you might consider forgetting about Windows 95 and buying a used machine . Used 486-based systems only a couple of years old , with double-speed CD-ROM drives and 14,400-bit modems , are selling for around $1,000 . Win95 's need for hard disk space and memory may also make last year 's machines obsolete , swelling the supply of nearly new systems . <p> Windows 95 is n't the only revolution . Multimedia PCs with CD-ROM drives were introduced just four years ago , but already nearly all new software programs are published on CD-ROMs . Most of today 's programs use a degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splashy multimedia tutorials . As video and sound technology continues to improve , multimedia will get more elaborate  --  and will take up even more disk space . The boom in online services imposes still more demands . Downloading news , software updates and multimedia files takes a capacious hard drive and the speediest modem available  --  meaning 28,800 bits . <p> All of these changes conspire to make you think hard about the future as well as the present  --  unless you are prepared , a couple of years from now , to shell out several hundred dollars to upgrade your system , tinker with its innards or sell it for one third of what you paid . To stave off obsolescence , insist on a system that comes with Win95 installed ( not in a box for you to do it ) , a 75-megahertz or faster Pentium processor , at least 8 megabytes of RAM , or system memory , a hard drive of 750MB or more and a quadruple-speed CD-ROM drive . Many systems come with relatively slow modems . Try to swap anything slower than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , manufacturers are pushing features that make their machines stand out , like built-in answering machines with voice-mail boxes for each family member , and the ability to control basic functions through spoken commands instead of with a mouse . Paying extra for such frills , unless you find one compelling , may come at the cost of features far more significant . <p> A potential exception is an improvement in motion video , which to date has been disappointing . PCs with MPEG ( Motion Picture Expert Group ) video playback chips on their system boards  --  notably Compaq , IBM and NEC  --  deliver sharper , smoother video clips that can run full screen without losing too much quality . You 'll need MPEG-compatible software  --  some games have it already  --  to take full advantage of the technology . <p> In trying to get the sweetest deal , many people make decisions that turn out to save a little and cost a lot . Here are strategies for avoiding common mistakes : <p> BEWARE OF " BARGAINS . " While seemingly priced low , package deals  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a printer  --  do n't always provide good value . <p> The monitor deserves special attention . The resolution ( the number of dots , or pixels ) , dot pitch ( the distance between the dots ) and the refresh rate ( how fast the monitor redraws the display ) all affect visual comfort . If the resolution is too coarse , the dot pitch too high and the refresh rate too low , images will be fuzzy or will flicker  --  and you 're the one who will be courting a headache . Check the specs carefully . What you want is a resolution of 1,024 by 768 pixels , a .28-dot pitch and a refresh rate of 75Hz . <p> Try to find an additional $100 or so for a 15- rather than a 14-inch display . That 1-inch difference is surprisingly significant when family members are staring at the screen for hours at a stretch playing the latest 3-D game . Seventeen-inch monitors , which start at about $800 , are worthwhile if you work at home or have another reason to spend whole days in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better off spending the money elsewhere . Besides , 17-inch monitors take up more desk territory . If you 're likely to place the monitor where sunlight will hit it and are sensitive to glare , an antiglare screen costs about $50 to $70 . <p> Before buying a monitor , examine the store model carefully . When you get a unit home , turn it on , wait a few minutes and inspect the image . If there is anything strange about it  --  bowing at the edges or blurriness  --  call the manufacturer . You may only need to adjust some settings on the monitor or in Windows 95  --  but monitors often get injured while traveling from the manufacturer to the retailer or to your home . If that 's the case , pack it up and send it back . <p> GET PLENTY OF SPACE . Windows 95 is greedy ; the last items to shortchange are memory and storage . Until very recently , many home PCs  --  particularly less-expensive models  --  came with only 4MB of RAM . With Windows 3.1 , that meant slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and multimedia applications . With Windows 95 , the minimum is 8MB , and indeed virtually all manufacturers have put 8MB even in their entry-level systems . <p> One of the key advantages of Windows 95 over Windows 3.1 is its ability to do more than one thing at a time  --  so you can read your E-mail while the computer checks the spelling on your Great American Novel . If this sounds at all tempting , you will need more than 8MB of RAM to make this multi-tasking feature work right . A comfortable total is 16MB ; adding another 8MB will cost about $320 . <p> You will need the largest hard drive your budget can afford , to store multimedia programs and information you 're likely to download off online services . Luckily , the price has plummeted over the last couple of years . Once unimaginable , 1-gigabyte hard disks are commonplace today . Even NEC 's least expensive $1,799 Ready 7022 comes with a 1GB hard disk . <p> CONSIDER THE QUALITY QUESTION . More vendors are vying for the pocketbooks of home PC buyers than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record in selling systems into homes  --  Apple , Compaq , IBM , Gateway 2000 and Packard Bell  --  are still at it . And now high-profile companies such as Digital Equipment Corp. , Hewlett-Packard and NEC that are well known in other markets are pushing to grab a share of the home market . Smaller companies known to buyers of business PCs , such as AST and Acer , are also selling new lines of home systems . <p> It 's pretty tough to tell these brands apart , let alone judge their quality by eye . A flimsy case , once a sure sign of corners cut elsewhere , is less common than a few years ago , observes Robert Kane , who supervises the testing of 1,000-plus PCs each year as director of ZD Labs , a testing facility for such Ziff-Davis publications as PC Magazine . <p> Today , the cost-cutting measures are hidden inside the PC . A common but disturbing practice is for manufacturers to buy the cheapest controller chips from different suppliers and to match them up with other brands of chips instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This can cause internal timing problems , which in turn lead to system crashes and the inability to run some software , warns Kane . <p> Since nonexperts can not readily tell if a PC has questionable components , you would be well advised to steer clear of unfamiliar brands . But even that is no guarantee . Even established players are rumored to shave costs this way . Packard Bell , for example , has been accused by Compaq and some customers of including used and returned components in some of its systems . Packard Bell denies the charge . <p> The only way to be sure what 's inside is to have an informed person take a look . Once you 've bought a PC , you may want to ask a technical friend to inspect it for you  --  or pay someone $50 or so to make a house call . You would n't buy a used car , or a house , without an expert 's opinion , would you ? <p> WATCH FOR SPEED TRAPS . The sudden popularity of the Internet and commercial online services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to participate in online discussions with millions of unseen strangers has n't lured you into cyberspace , regular programs may soon do the trick . Increasingly , CD-ROM disks like encyclopedias and others that need to be timely are dialing into online services to get updates ( box , Page 108 ) . News services are popping up on World Wide Web sites all over the Internet ( box , Page 106 ) . To download all these files , you 'll want the fastest modem you can get . <p> For many home PCs  --  such as Compaq 's least expensive $1,699 Presario 7170 model and $1,999 7180  --  the only modem available is an underpowered 14,400-bit model . Passing up these systems or buying a 28,800-bit modem would be wise . Prices start at $135 for an internal , $155 for an external . IBM and NEC bundle all their home PCs with 28,800-bit modems . <p> MAYBE MAIL-ORDER . Companies that sell PCs through the mail , such as Dell Computer and Gateway 2000 , used to have sole province over superlow prices and superior technical support policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up over the last couple of years , comparable bargains and three-year warranties can be found from a variety of players . <p> But mail order still ca n't be beat for freedom of choice . Do n't like the modem that comes with your store-bought Presario ? Too bad . Gateway 2000 , on the other hand , will sell you just about any flavor of monitor , hard disk , modem or video board you 'd like . <p> Having it your way just may turn out to be the most compelling reason to pick one PC over another . It might even make you feel better about spending all that money . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By Mary Kathleen Flynn and Patricia Peart <p> Misplaced angst THE FUTURE OF THE MACINTOSH <p> Windows or Mac ? Mac or Windows ? After months of price and feature comparisons , you chose a Mac . Now the new computer is perched on your desk , its hard drive crying out to be filled with flashy multimedia games and home-office programs . If you 're rushing off to the nearest mall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even at computer superstores , you 'll likely find just a shelf or two of Mac software . <p> Since Apple Computer represents less than 10 percent of the PC market , many retailers virtually ignore the Mac . That , says Adrian Mello , editor of Macworld magazine , creates " a perception that there are n't a lot of Mac-related products to choose from . But just because you do n't see them on the shelf does n't mean they are n't out there . " <p> Macs by mail . Nearly 8,000 titles are available  --  in mail-order houses . About 70 percent of Mac software is bought through these companies , which generally offer lower prices and more expertise than you 'll find at retail . MacWarehouse ( 800-255-6227 ) , the MacZone ( 800-248-0800 ) and MacConnection ( 800-800-4444 ) are among the more popular and reputable firms . One World Plaza 's Macintosh Shopping Directory on the Web ( http : //www.owplaza.com/msd ) has a longer list , vetted for frauds . <p> But if your tastes run more to malling than mailing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apple Computer and a handful of Macintosh software developers unveiled a new initiative to boost the Macintosh 's presence in computer stores nationwide . Retailers like Best Buy , CompUSA and Egghead Software have agreed to devote more shelf space to Mac products . <p> Many Macintosh owners , however , fear that developers will stop designing Mac software altogether , since most of the market is Windows-driven . Those worries seem unfounded . From a software publisher 's point of view , releasing a Macintosh version makes good business sense . Production costs for Mac software are lower than those for Windows titles ; less testing is required because there is a single standard for Mac hardware and software . And Macintosh owners buy 30 percent more software than their Windows counterparts . <p> Perhaps more to the point , says Shelley Day , CEO of Humongous Entertainment , " developers are n't going to walk away from 20 million machines . " Humongous has eight CD-ROM titles on the market , including top seller Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo ( Page 100 ) . Like a growing number of developers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CD-ROM that runs on both platforms . That helps ease the Mac versus Windows indecision . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Mac Performa box <p> By John Simons <p>
