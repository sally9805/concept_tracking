In the 1984 documentary " I 'm almost not crazy ... " John Cassavetes defines filmmaking as " waiting around ... for your dynamic turn . " That surely applies to his own improvisatory works : Shadows , Faces , Husbands , Minnie and Moskowitz . They are anguished home movies of actors searching for the precise pitch of rage or love . The films mean to grapple with painful truth , but it can seem ages between epiphanies . A Cassavetes movie often plays like two hours in the waiting-waiting-waiting room of the Actors Studio . <P> The weird thing about She 's So Lovely is that a script by the impresario of improv , directed by his son , should become a tight , slight , goofy romance . As the lovestruck Eddie , Sean Penn denounces his wife 's perfume as " a good smell to cover up bad smell . " John Travolta , as the second husband of Eddie 's beloved Maureen ( Robin Wright Penn ) , snaps at his young stepdaughter , " You have n't lived long enough for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of blue sky . " The film has the soul of a sailor after a few drinks , and the mouth of a randier Damon Runyon . <P> The guilty secret of John Cassavetes ' films was that they relied on Hollywood star quality . His lupine smile sent out laser beams of frantic menace , and Gena Rowlands had ( still has ) a face the camera ca n't stop watching . When she shows up in She 's So Lovely to hear Penn murmur , " You 're a very beautiful woman , and I have n't been around the kindness of women in some time , " it 's a sweet tribute from this generation of Method mesmerizers to the one who taught them how . <P> Director Nick Cassavetes is less a full-fledged auteur here than a cheerleader and referee , keeping the stars fighting without biting . Wright , like Maureen , is game for any outsize challenge , but her bantam desperation sounds shrill ; at times she is overrun by the wild gestures that seize Maureen . Travolta , though , balances nicely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has every garish shade of Eddie in his palette . He gets the pain , charm and drive , the stumbling humor of a guy whose only religion is the woman who betrayed him . He turns a jerk into a heroic figure : St. Doofus . <P>  --  Richard Corliss
