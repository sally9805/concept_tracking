<p> Iraq continued its defiance today in the face of possible U.S. military strikes , saying it would not be swayed by " empty threats . " <p> A second group of U.N . relief workers left Iraq by bus today , and the ruling party 's newspaper condemned the increasing possibility of U.S. airstrikes as American " psychological warfare . " The evacuation of about 40 people raised to 170 the number of humanitarian program employees who have been evacuated to neighboring Jordan since Wednesday . All 103 U.N . weapons inspectors flew to Bahrain that same day . British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein today that time was running out in the escalating crisis over U.N . weapons inspectors . <p> " The next step is action if he is not prepared to come back into compliance with his word , " he said . <p> " He has carried on fabricating evidence , telling lies about his programme , attempting to prevent the inspectors doing their work . . . We can not allow such a situation to happen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq showed no sign of allowing U.N . arms inspections to resume . Official Iraqi newspapers published a statement today by the ruling Baath party urging Arab nations to rally behind Iraq and strike at American interests in case of U.S. aggression . In a front-page editorial , the Baath party newspaper al-Thawra said the U.S. military preparations in the Persian Gulf were part of American " psychological warfare . " " Iraq no longer pays attention to these empty threats , " it said , asserting that Iraq will not back down . The official al-Qadissiya newspaper said Saddam 's Cabinet discussed the crisis Wednesday . Iraq 's five official dailies published pictures of Saddam meeting ministers and senior military commanders to discuss a response to " American and Zionist aggression . " Iraqis appeared to be taking the situation in stride , and there was little evidence of panic or people rushing to stockpile food . The United States and Britain have been threatening a military response since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the activities of the U.N .

He also dispatched 4,000 ground troops to defend Kuwait in case of an Iraqi attack . Clinton said in a Veterans Day speech that the United States would be compelled to act unless Iraq immediately permits the resumption of U.N . inspections of its weapons facilities . <p> " A failure to respond could embolden Saddam to act recklessly , signaling to him that he can with impunity develop these weapons of mass destruction or threaten his neighbors , " Clinton told several hundred military officers and veterans at Arlington National Cemetery . The president said inaction in the face of continuing provocation from Saddam would damage permanently the credibility of the United Nations . <p> Clinton delivered his most extensive remarks on the current impasse with Baghdad as part of a concerted administration effort to portray the United States as resolute and prepared to act at any time to punish Saddam . William Cohen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and ground forces in the region , including the ground troops being sent to defend Kuwait . The secretary of state and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs both delivered public warnings that military action was imminent if Saddam did not back down . Clinton said if Iraq was permitted to resume work on chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , it quickly could restore its capacity to imperil its citizens and its neighbors with weapons of mass destruction . " If the inspectors are not permitted to visit suspect sites or monitor compliance at known production facilities , they may as well be in Baltimore , not Baghdad , " Clinton said . " That would open a window of opportunity for Iraq to rebuild its arsenal of weapons and delivery system in months  --  and I say again  --  in months , not years . " <p> The State Department withdrew nonessential personnel from Israel and Kuwait to protect them from possible Iraqi retaliation for an American military strike . Secretary of State Madeleine Albright delayed for a day , until Friday , her scheduled departure for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her usual airplane to a special Department of Defense flying command center known as the Doomsday Plane , capable of secure communications with U.S. forces anywhere on the globe . She used the same airplane in August when she traveled to Africa at the time the administration was in the final stages of planning missile strikes in retaliation for embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania . Clinton earlier this week pushed back his departure for the economic conference , giving him more time to participate in deliberations on the Iraq crisis . White House officials said the president could cancel his trip if he decides to use force against Baghdad . Albright said that even as additional forces flow into the region , the United States is ready to act at any time . In addition to the attack planes and ground forces ordered to the gulf Wednesday , the aircraft carrier Enterprise and its battle group are en route to the region , and are expected to arrive Nov. 23 . " We see no need for further warnings , " Albright said in an interview with reporters and editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is willing to mount a punishing military attack against Iraq , he still would prefer a peaceful solution to the current crisis . He said that intrusive inspection of Iraqi weapons sites is more effective than bombing in corralling Saddam 's military ambitions . " We continue to hope  --  indeed , pray  --  that Saddam will comply , " Clinton said . " But we must be prepared to act if he does not . " The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Gen. Henry H. Shelton , said Wednesday that Saddam has been sufficiently warned of the consequences of continuing to defy the United States and the United Nations . " He understands that all options remain on the table today , " Shelton said , " that we have tried over the years to get him to comply with U.N . resolutions and to honor these commitments ; that he does , in fact , pose a threat to an area that is a vital national interest to the United States , and that he poses a threat not only to his neighbors but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve in that region . " <p> Possible strikes against Iraq got qualified support from Former President Carter . <p> " If the military action can be very narrowly restricted , just to military targets , and not wipe out an area that has civilians in it . . . I think ( the United States ) might get away with it , " Carter said in a interview taped for telecast tonight at 8 on CNBC . American officials said the aim of any military strike would be to destroy Iraq 's weapons plants and depots , weaken its offensive capability and persuade Saddam to submit to international inspections once more . Despite the threats and the growing American military strike force in the region , there is no assurance that military action will accomplish the administration 's goals . The Persian Gulf War of 1991 did not curtail Saddam 's weapons programs , although more than 500,000 American troops and 2,000 aircraft were employed in a campaign that inflicted serious damage on Iraq and its army . Two small-scale American military strikes , in 1993 and 1996 , likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , American intelligence analysts said that they believed that American attacks had strengthened Saddam 's political position within Iraq . Shelton said that the attacks being contemplated this time would be more effective than past efforts because the United States today has better weapons , better technology and better intelligence than it had even eight years ago . Shelton also defended the conduct of the Gulf War , although it left Saddam in power and in a position to resume work on his arsenal . " I would also say that the objectives of the Gulf War were met , " he said . " We did , in fact , reduce the threat that Saddam Hussein posed . We stopped that war only after he agreed to the commitments that he now is failing to honor . " <p> Prudent departure : Employees prepare Wednesday to leave the U.N . compound in Baghdad . The United Nations began withdrawing its nonessential staff from Iraq amid reports that the United States was preparing to strike in a bid to force Baghdad to back down from its decision to freeze all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press Graphic : THE U.S. BUILDUP President Clinton has ordered additional forces to the Persian Gulf region in response to Iraq 's refusal to allow U.N . arms inspections . <p> WHAT 'S THERE NOW Troops 23,500 American troops including 1,500 Army troops in Kuwait from Fort Stewart Aircraft - about 170 , including : 10 F-14 Tomcats 36 F/A-18 Hornets 4 EA-6B Prowlers 4 E-2C Hawkeyes 8 S-3A/B Vikings 6 Seahawks <p> Ships - 23 , including : 2 Guided missile cruisers 5 Destroyers 1 Guided-missile frigate 1 Attack submarine 1 Mine countermeasures ship 1 Amphibious assault ship 1 Amphibious transport dock 1 Dock landing ship 1 Aircraft carrier ( USS Eisenhower ) Air defense 3 Patriot anti-missile batteries <p> WHAT 'S COMING Troops 3,000 Army troops Air defense 3 Patriot anti-missile batteries Aircraft Aircraft - 129 , including : 12 B-52 bombers armed with ... 96 air-launched cruise missiles 6 B-1 bombers 12 F-117A Stealth fighters 52 F-15 , F-16 and F-18 attack jets 47 Support aircraft , including radar jammers , tankers and refuelers <p> Source : U.S. Department of Defense / Knight Ridder Tribune and Associated Press
