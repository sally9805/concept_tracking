Who made the following statement : " Before we send thousands of American soldiers to their deaths , let 's make damn sure America 's vital interests are threatened " ? <P> a ) George McGovern <P> b ) Jane Fonda <P> c ) Ron Kovic <P> d ) Patrick J. Buchanan <P> Answer : Patrick J. Buchanan , fire-breathing conservative columnist and former White House speechwriter for Richard Nixon . <P> In times of national emergency , Americans tend to rally round the flag and get behind the President . So it is with the crisis in the Persian Gulf . Public-opinion polls demonstrate solid support for George Bush 's handling of the showdown with Saddam Hussein , and there have been only a few peeps of criticism from members of Congress . Thus it comes as a surprise that the loudest dissent against the President 's policy is being voiced by , of all people , prominent figures on the Republican right wing . <P> In language reminiscent of Vietnam-era protests , a host of conservative skeptics have been warning against American involvement in the Persian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than America 's " way of life " is on the line , the critics reply that no vital U.S. interest is at stake . Buchanan has been leading the charge , arguing , " There are lots of things worth fighting for , but an extra 10 cents for a gallon of gas is n't one of them . " Ted Galen Carpenter , director of foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute , cautions that " making the U.S. the guardian of global stability is a blueprint for the indefinite prolongation of expensive and risky U.S. military commitments around the world . " Edward N. Luttwak of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies even accuses the President of " fleeing from the intractable economic problems at home to a more attractive geopolitical role . " <P> What accounts for this sudden sprouting of caution on the right ? Partly it is a return to isolationist tendencies that go back to the earliest days of the Republic . In 1796 George Washington warned against the dangers of entangling alliances : " The great rule of conduct for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our commercial relations , to have with them as little political connection as possible . " Over the centuries , the desire to retreat from a global role has ebbed and flowed , and in the 1930s Congress even passed neutrality laws in the hope of preventing the U.S. from being dragged into World War II . <P> But today 's dissenters differ in important ways from isolationists of earlier eras . Though they may sound like leftist antiwar critics , these right- wingers tended to be die-hard supporters of the Vietnam War . But they differ with fellow conservatives , like former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , who have been urging a quick strike to cripple Saddam Hussein .
