<p> PATRICIA MOSTUE is one of many parents faced with decisions about her children 's extracurricular activities . She enrolled her eldest daughter , Anne , in piano lessons at age 10 . Now , four years later , Anne 's music time is increasingly squeezed by the demands of high school , and Ms. Mostue wonders if Anne should have begun music lessons earlier . <p> As soon as that memorable first day of kindergarten , and sometimes even earlier , parents like Mostue are often inundated with forms for enrolling their son or daughter in soccer or music lessons , ballet , or the school chess club . Which activities will most nurture their child 's natural talents or help cultivate new ones ? How many activities are too many ? How do parents strike a balance for their children between scheduled activities and down time ? <p> David Elkind , professor of child development at Tufts University in Medford , Mass. , and author of " The Hurried Child , " suggests limiting school-age children to " one social activity like scouting , one extracurricular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hours a week on these . Children need time to play with their friends , to play Nintendo or on the computer , to look out the window , " he adds . <p> Dr. Elkind 's suggestion made a friend of mine laugh . Her fifth-grade daughter has chosen to be involved in a theater group with thrice-weekly rehearsals as well as several musical endeavors . <p> Music lessons are often one of the first after-school activities signed up for , especially with school budget cutbacks eliminating many music programs in the classroom . <p> Not that parents need to wait until school age to expose their child to music . Educators agree that this exposure should start at a young age . " Kids need to be singing . The most important thing kids need to be able to do is develop their aural capability and listening to music , " says David Lapin , executive director of the Community Music Center of Boston . <p> At Indian Hill Arts , a music school in Littleton , Mass. , children as young as 18 months are enrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and child . " Mom or Dad is moving to the music with the toddler in their arms or dancing with the child , or holding their hands while they use rhythm instruments for the first time so that Mom or Dad 's body is guiding the child and moving with the child , " says Erika Boardman Kraft , director of the school of music at Indian Hill . <p> Ms. Kraft suggests exposing children to live music , not just compact discs . That way , she says , children realize that " there 's a live human behind it , that it does n't just come out of a box . " <p> After that initial exposure , what is the best age for children to begin studying a musical instrument ? Because of the range of instruments as well as of philosophies , there are no easy answers . Music educators in the Boston area who were asked that question gave a variety of responses - from age 3 to fourth grade . <p> Tufts University 's Elkind says that in terms of coordination , attention span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 are not ready for formal lessons . <p> But Mr. Lapin says that readiness depends on the individual child . <p> Susan Tucker , executive and artistic director of the Powers Music School in Belmont , Mass. , says , " It 's very important for parents to look at who their child is . It would seem cruel to ask a five-year-old who ca n't sit still for 30 seconds to sit at a piano . There are other five-year-olds who sit in a corner for 40 minutes drawing . " <p> To assess readiness , music educators say that parents should consider such factors as the child 's physical size , motor development , level of interest , ability to process more than one piece of information at a time , and choice of instrument . <p> Samantha Seeley , now 11 , was in the first grade when she asked for violin lessons . Her mother , Susan , says that must have been the right time because her daughter made the decision . <p> Eric Weinberger , on the other hand , started piano lessons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was n't longing to , " his mother , Janet says . " But we thought , at that point , it was a good time to introduce something . " <p> As for choosing that first instrument , educators agree that some are more appropriate for younger students than others . They recommend piano , recorder , curved-head flute , tin whistle , and string instruments that have been sized down to one-quarter or one-half of the normal size . Children who want to play more physically demanding instruments such as the bassoon , tuba , oboe , and French horn , may have to wait until fourth grade or even later . <p> Thomas O'Halloran , director of music at the public schools in Carlisle , Mass. , says that although his program offers percussion and wind-instrument lessons in fourth grade , there are arguments for beginning later . " If a seventh grader starts , they start at a different place altogether . Any physical limitations are behind them and , you hope , they 're smarter so they can learn faster . " <p> On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " For many students , the years 10 to 14 are difficult ; it 's culturally a hard time to start . Students that age do n't like to do something that they do n't feel they do well . They find it difficult to be behind their peers ... " <p> Age and size , of course , are not the only consideration when choosing an instrument . Samantha was initially interested in the violin , but Mrs. Seeley says , " I suggested she do viola because I was aware that your options are greater with viola because so many kids are taking violin . She 's had a lot of opportunities that she might not have had otherwise , like being able to participate in the New England Conservatory orchestra on Saturdays . " <p> Kraft urges parents to get the best-quality instrument they can afford , " so the child has a chance of getting a lovely sound out of it . Some of the instruments we see , even a faculty member could n't get a lovely sound out of . " <p> Richard Colwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suggests third or fourth grade as a good time to begin an instrument . <p> But the conservatory 's Project STEP , a program that identifies African-American children who have the potential to someday play string instruments in symphony orchestras , starts in first grade . After two years of movement and recorder instruction , the small group of students begins string instruments . <p> " We do n't take them after third grade , " says Mr. Colwell . " It takes that long if they want to be a competitive performer after college graduation . " <p> Getting involved in a child 's music education can benefit the parent as well as the child . Although Seeley was initially reluctant to learn a string instrument , as required by the Suzuki program her daughter was enrolled in , that year of viola lessons opened new horizons for both of them . <p> " Now I truly enjoy string music ; I never really enjoyed classical music before , and it 's become my music of choice , " Seeley says . " You really can become a partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Samantha and I share musical experiences . "
