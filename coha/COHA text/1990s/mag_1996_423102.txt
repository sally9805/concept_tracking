Hey man , there are two chicks in that truck " Kim Keller and Sandy Phillips hear words to that effect nearly every day as people in their hometown of Springfield , Missouri , crane their necks to get a better look at the two women roofers in their heavy-duty pickup truck with the words " Bolivar Insulation " painted on the sides and the extension ladders piled on top . " People are totally shocked , " Phillips says . Often , the noise of Skil(R) saws , nail guns , and churning concrete mixers goes still as soon as the two women in ponytails appear at construction sites . The truth is , it 's still a man 's world out there on construction jobs and in machine shops , where blue-collar workers earn , on average , nearly twice as much as their pink-collar sisters at office desks and nursing stations . Although the number of women employed in the construction , machine , electrical , and repair-shop trades has nearly doubled in 20 years  --  from 5.4 percent in 1974 to 9.3 percent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the jackhammer scene . And recently , the percentage of tradeswomen in some occupations has actually declined ( see chart ) . Percentage of Women Employed , 1984/1994  --  1984  --  1994 PLUMBERS , PIPE FITTERS  --  1.1%  --  0.7% CONSTRUCTION VEHICLE OPERATORS  --  5.3%  --  6.9% ELECTRICIANS  --  1.2%  --  2.1% CRANE AND TOWER OPERATORS  --  2.4%  --  1.7% PRECISION WOODWORKERS  --  15.9%  --  10.9% PRECISION METALWORKERS  --  6%  --  6.5% CARPENTERS  --  1.3%  --  1% MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATORS  --  9.6%  --  11% " We 've had substantial integration of women into nontraditional professions like law and medicine , " says Diane Pearce , director of the Women and Poverty Program of Wider Opportunities for Women ( WOW ) , a Washington , D.C.-based advocacy group that connects women with blue-collar training programs . " But that 's been counterbalanced by losses or lack of progress among much larger groups of craft occupations . " Despite the small numbers being hired , women who are trying to increase their income  --  or get off welfare with a job that covers the cost of living  --  still believe the skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child care worker or a cashier making $4.50 an hour , you can get along as long as you do n't have a child or do n't have a crisis like a car breaking down , " says Pearce . Kim Keller says that it was just such " dead-end " prospects that pushed her and Sandy Phillips to invest a year of their lives in Springfield 's Construction Readiness Education for Women ( CREW ) program . Phillips , 28 , had been a nurse 's aide . Keller , 27 , was a receptionist . Both went on welfare when pregnancies overloaded their working-poor wages . Project CREW offered them a nontraditional way out . CREW is one of dozens of training programs that have started up since the federal government noticed how few of its efforts under the Job Training and Partnership Act actually succeeded in attracting women into the trades . CREW , funded by the Missouri Women 's Council , is a joint effort of the local community college and Job Council of the Ozarks , Springfield 's vocational counseling center . Since 1994 it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom are now working on construction sites or at related jobs . CREW students range in age and background , but all have the same goal in mind during their year of practicing with power tools , building from blueprints , and working out in the gym : they want their fair share of the skilled labor jobs that have been artificially off-limits for too long . Keller and Phillips say they took a chance on their new careers because they wanted more security for their children . They admit they 're still struggling with the start-up pay of $6 an hour , but both feel they now have more financial opportunity . They expect to earn more as their installation speed increases , and as additional on-the-job training broadens their know-how . " I 'm finally starting to see a light somewhere , " says Keller . Why are n't more women finding their way out of the pink-collar ghetto or off welfare and into the skilled trades ? The answer is depressingly simple . It comes down to three things : lack of training , prejudice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearing jobs  --  is only true of some trades in some areas . On construction sites , for example , jobs are going begging . Dan Bennet , of Associated Builders and Contractors , a national trade group , says there 's a " severe labor shortage " in his field : " We 've got contractors all over the U.S. who would like to bid work but know they ca n't get the skilled employees . " That 's why , says Bennet , some contractors are taking on female employees , and adding women 's bathrooms and making sure to hire at least two women for job sites , so they can watch out for each other . Lauren Sugerman , a former elevator constructor and director of Chicago Women in Trades , a training and support group , has been suggesting those types of innovations for years . Hardly anyone paid attention . But that may change . " Projections show that two thirds of new entrants in the workforce between now and the year 2000 will be women and people of color , " says Sugerman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are mostly white men , are SS or older ) companies will have to attract women if they want to stay in business . Keller says it was the demand for construction labor that first got her thinking about blue-collar work , rather than following her earlier plan of training to be a court reporter . " I said , ' Hey , things are booming , why should I let all the men do it ? ' " Despite the demand for workers skilled in the trades , schools continue to prepare girls for service and clerical jobs with low incomes , while training boys for jobs that come with breadwinner incomes . In 1992 , girls were enrolled in only 6.5 percent of apprenticeships in the U.S. ; 90 percent of them were working toward jobs like lab technician or cosmetologist , with an average weekly wage of $247 . Less than one percent were training for jobs like auto mechanic , with an average weekly wage of $523 . Asked why girls are not recruited for training in the trades , one administrator told WOW , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls generally are n't interested . " Yet girls are overrepresented in training for occupations such as nursing , says Diana Pearce , which involves changing bedpans and lifting patients . And the disparity between the wages , status , and advancement of pink- and blue-collar trades , says Sugerman , goes back to the value that society places on the work and on the genders of the people doing it . Only a few vocational programs have been able to bleak through these barriers . The 1991 Nontraditional Employment for Women ( NEW ) Act was an attempt to improve the situation . It allowed states to use federal money to pay for women 's training programs and encouraged the states to seek out programs that used female mentors , had vocational counselors trained to motivate women , and attempted to educate employers about women 's abilities . NEW , however , has been eliminated from current House and Senate proposals . The states will instead most likely receive block grants for job training , to spend as they like . Getting rid of NEW is like " throwing away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recent studies , nontraditional training programs pay for themselves in about 14 months , in the form of taxes from newly employed carpenters , electricians , and pipe fitters , and in the form of savings on welfare checks that the women wo n't need . But that has n't convinced the government to continue investing in these programs . At the same time , most women are in nontraditional jobs only because affirmative action laws and regulations " have enabled us to crack the door open just a small wedge , " says Lauren Sugerman . Without NEW and affirmative action , she questions whether the door can remain open . Even in the training programs that are available , there 's still a big leap from learning a skill to getting a job , says Springfield 's CREW director , Kathy Brazeale , herself a graduate of the program 's first class in 1994 . Keller 's and Phillips ' experience highlights how tough it can be to break through . Bob Satterfield , production supervisor at Bolivar Insulation , was not terribly excited at first about hiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolivar 's vice president of personnel . " The guys were a little skeptical , " she says of her attempts over a three-year period to get women on the roofing and installation payroll . It took CREW 's growing reputation as a quality program  --  and a labor shortage brought on by a building boom in nearby Branson , where Las Vegas-like theaters have been cropping up seemingly overnight  --  to get Bolivar executives to change their minds . CREW graduates start out with greater enthusiasm and technical knowledge than many of " the young guys with shoulders this wide , " says Brazeale . Even so , " some of these construction companies will hire boys out of high school and give them a chance . But a woman has to have something like CREW . " About the only advantage the women have is that contractors ca n't get the young guys to show up for work half the time , says Brazeale . That and perseverance : despite having the phone slammed down in their ear numerous times when calling for work , the women keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Job Council of the Ozarks . At this point , 12 of the 14 graduates of the 1995 class have jobs in construction and related industries , she says . Satterfield says that he 's impressed with Keller 's and Phillips ' work . " Their attitudes , attendance , and quality are great . That 's very hard to find right now . So far , they 've done everything the guys have done . Actually , what I 'm finding is they 'll take a little more time than a guy will , to install something the right way . " Dan Bennet says that other employers are reporting similar discoveries : women are proving to be skillful workers who do n't necessarily need brute strength to get the job done . New technologies are easing the labor load for both men and women , while attention to detail is becoming more important in an increasingly competitive economy . Bennet remembers one employer telling him about a female heavy-equipment operator who consistently used less fuel per hour to run her machinery than her male coworkers . The boss assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he put her on another piece of equipment , she also began operating that at $4 less fuel per hour . He decided to check out what she was doing and discovered , says Bennet , that her " trick " was " careful hand-eye coordination and taking the maintenance manual for real . " The majority of women rarely get a chance to show their stuff in quite that way . The biggest obstacle is plain old belligerence . In a Chicago Women in Trades survey , for example , nearly 70 percent of the African American women and more than half of the European American women surveyed said they had been on jobs where men refused to work with them . In addition , 49 percent of all the women in the survey said they had heard male coworkers make remarks about their race or ethnicity . It was just that kind of attitude that made Keller hesitate about looking for a job . " I could n't imagine myself walking up to a site with 50 men standing around , " she says . Her experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the few women in her electronics class ; a rumor that she planned to file sex discrimination charges against a superior prompted the brass to sabotage her test scores and kick her out . " From then on , I was in clerical positions , " she says . But Keller was hired on at Bolivar in June 1995 , soon after Phillips , and the two inevitably became a team . They later heard through the local grapevine that Bolivar salesmen had been wagering on how long it would take for the women to go back to desk jobs . In fact , " the salesmen soon went back and told everyone that we were really pretty good and that we surprised them , " says Keller . They were lucky not to face direct harassment of the sort that another CREW graduate , Donna Waltman , was hit with . " I got hired as a joke  --  just to see how long I 'd last , " she says . " They worked my butt off until I flaked out . They did it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd last . " Waltman withstood the extreme assignments and haranguing for a week before quitting . There are innumerable ways that women can be made to feel uncomfortable  --  or endangered  --  on a job site . Everything from ridicule to sexual innuendo to actually tampering with scaffolding or machinery has been documented by various groups working with women trying to break into nontraditional fields . Keller and Phillips admit they 've had to walk a fine line to maintain good relations . Their biggest problem is men 's eagerness to protect " helpless " women . They would love help at times , but men 's attitude toward women can make that help dangerous . Phillips says that one guy was so uncomfortable with the sight of two women hoisting a heavy extension ladder that he grabbed it out of Keller 's hands , nearly toppling the ladder over on all of them . " They want to help , but most of the time they just get in the way . If you tell them no , they get their feelings hurt , " says Phillips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next step  --  the possibility that " helpfulness " will turn into the kind of harassment that Waltman experienced . Both women have worked hard to build camaraderie with their coworkers . " Most of the guys are opening up to us , " says Phillips . " They tease us , give us a hard time , play jokes on us . They treat us like they would anybody else . I try and make sure to talk to them , to shoot the crap or whatever . I 'm pretty mouthy anyway , " she says of her ability to banter with the boys , several of whom she and Keller know from high school days . The two women are also earning respect for their ability to do a good job . One day , after using pulleys to hoist their scaffolding three stories , they turned to see a gaggle of electricians watching from the building next door . " They were clapping , " Keller says , " so we bowed : ' Yes we can do it , thank you very much . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the glazed-donut and thermal-cup coffee klatches that dot construction sites , she says . " Suddenly , everybody in the field knows about you . We have people recognize us in stores . " Being part of a two-woman team has saved both women 's sanity . " We 're lucky to be together , " Phillips says . " We understand each other . We compensate for each other to get the job done . When you 're with a man it 's hard to say , ' Can you help me pick this up ? ' " They 've developed little tricks for installing roofing that take advantage of their size difference : " Sandy 's a rung shorter than me , " says Keller , so she usually hangs onto the rung above Phillips while they both walk their cranelike extension ladder into place . At the steep edges of rooftop gables , it 's Phillips who sits on Keller 's legs so they can nail the soffit into place . No matter what the stresses are , this is work that both women have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " says Keller . " You never understand a job in construction until you 're standing on a roof , and your boss comes out and you 're waving at him from three stories up . " For Phillips the pleasures on the job are many , but perhaps the most important thing about her work is the impact it has had on her daughter : " My little girl , who 's three , wants to do drywall when she gets older . I got her a toolbox for Christmas and she 's already dismantled her tricycle . " Patty Cantrell is a freelance writer based in Springfield , Missouri .

He would n't talk to me for , like , a month after that  --  and all because Lea could n't keep her big fat mouth shut . <br> She must know how I really feel about her , right ?

And it 's not only my days at Peterson that are rushing back at me with the force of the rain I 'd escaped this morning but , like , my entire childhood  --  before I found out I was " gifted , " before I realized that being " gifted " was social suicide , before I met Danny and Lea and the rest of them . <br> Like , I 'd completely forgotten that for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inseparable  --  perhaps because of fate , perhaps because our last names were next to each other on all the class rosters  --  and it seemed nothing would tear us apart . Not gymnastics , which took away most of my weekends  --  or piano practice , which sucked up her weeknights . <br> Nothing could get us , we bravely and foolishly thought . <br> Or at least that 's what we bravely and foolishly thought until we learned about the disappearances of the fourth-graders . <br> They did n't disappear for good . We 're not talking about what happened to Kenny Castalucci and that other kid whose name no one remembers down by the Reservoir . I 'm talking about the fourth-graders who let themselves be taken away . The fourth-graders who left Dewey behind . <br> The Gifted Ones . The Chosen Ones . <br> The Lost Ones . <br> At first kids only whispered about them . About how they went away and came back Changed .

Your next-door neighbor does n't join the pack walking to the bus stop like always ; you watch in horror as a small bus comes directly to his front door and he steps on , looking confident and . . . different . The next time you see him playing outside , it 's with some other kid wearing glasses and he does n't even bother to introduce the two of you . Or worst of all , your best friend calls you tearfully to break the news that she 's leaving ; she tells you she does n't want to go and you want to tell her she does n't have to , but both of you know that she does and she does . <br> Each year one third grader was plucked from the safe , sturdy halls of Dewey Elementary and whisked away via the small buses we thought were reserved for only the handicapped and retarded , and transported to some school on the other side of Galestown , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with a program for the " gifted and talented . " We were all terrified at the prospect of getting Lost  --  and yet fascinated by the thought of a way out of Dewey that had nothing to do with sixth- grade graduation or a move to a nicer neighborhood or different military base . By March of our third-grade year , we could contain ourselves no longer and the whispers rose from throats as yelps of full-on paranoia and glee . <br>  --  I heard Peterson looks like Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory . <br>  --  For real ? <br>  --  No way . You 're lying , doofus. <br>  --  I 'm glad he 's lying . That movie is scaaaary . Did you see the part where they go through the tunnel and that monster 's mouth starts chomping open and shut like it 's gon na eat everyone ? <br>  --  You are such a baby . That was just a chicken . <br>  --  I heard that all the gifted and talented kids have to work for NASA . Some kids even blew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it was only that teacher who died . <br>  --  You 're soooo lying . <br>  --  Well , I heard the gifted kids get pizza every day . And not the cardboard stuff we get here . Real pizza . Like , from Pizza Hut . <br> And so forth . <br> Both Brianna and I could do long division while jumping rope , so it did n't surprise either one of us when we were chosen to take the test that would decide if our future would involve Pizza Hut or community college . <br> I suggested to her that we both fail on purpose , but she gave me a look that said she knew I could n't fail anything , not even if I tried , and I nodded in agreement and said , Let 's just do our best and see what happens . I do n't remember much about the test other than the fact that the man giving it was wearing a most unfortunate sweater , black with purple and turquoise lines . It looked a little like the " laser " option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> I hated his sweater even though I coveted the laser option as I did jelly shoes and white lace leggings , but my mom would have none of it . That 's what the poor kids chose , she explained , the ones whose mommies and daddies did n't care about ankle sprains resulting from inadequate footwear , who did n't understand that sensible clothing was the first line of defense against pedophilia , who did n't plan on ordering the deluxe packet of school photos  --  one large for the living room , four medium for offices and piano tops , plus forty wallet-size for Christmas cards  --  an assortment whose myriad uses left open only one option : the tasteful choice of basic blue  --  not the profile silhouette , not autumn leaves , and certainly not laser . It 's not what you want to hear as a kid when all the laser kids get grouped together , which meant all the cute boys and the cool girls were sharing plastic combs , while I was stuck with the same high-level readers I always got stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize the inverse correlation between coolness and socioeconomic status that existed in suburban public schools in the late ' 80s and early ' 90s , I realized she was right . <br> As soon as I got home , I called Bri so we could compare our answers to the questions . Do you remember the picture of the guy standing next to the tree ? she asked me. <br>  --  Yeah , I said . What did you think was wrong with it ? <br>  --  Well , the sun was n't out , but he cast a shadow . <br>  --  Oh , I answered . Crap ! My answer was that it was nighttime but he was wearing sunglasses , which was weird and reminded me of that Corey Hart song  --  and so I told the man in the unfortunate sweater that the problem with the picture was that Corey Hart was n't African American like the guy in the picture . The man asked me who Corey Hart was and I explained that he also wore sunglasses at night , and the man laughed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew in that instant that I had failed and Brianna was a super- genius who would leave me behind . I 'd have no best friend , no one to dress up in my mom 's clothes and entertain me , and I 'd be stupid on top of it . <br> So you can imagine my surprise when my mom and dad called me into the living room a week later to tell me I passed the test , was one of a select few in the city who passed , the only one in my school . It was the first time I remember feeling several emotions at once : terror , that I was to become one of the Lost Ones  --  did this mean I was going to have to wear glasses and care about current events ? ; excitement : I liked Pizza Hut as much as the next kid ; but , most of all , sadness : If I was the only kid from my school who passed , that meant Brianna had failed . <br> When I told them I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was my decision they would support it , even if it did mean missing out on an excellent opportunity . But the thing is , that was n't my decision . I felt bad about it , maybe even cried a little ( I cry a lot ; sunglasses help ) , but as I looked into my parents ' eyes I knew I could n't let them down . At my new school , they said , there 'd be other kids like me , kids who were really bored with the work at school , kids who were so far ahead of the others . But I did n't really want to think about being ahead of Bri . We always had done everything together , or at the very least , I 'd always let her do everything with me . <br> I called her because I could n't wait until the next day to tell her ( I might change my mind , and I knew that would be a mistake ) and she said she was happy for me and we both cried and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song we learned in Brownies  --  <br> Make new friends , but keep the old . <br> One is silver and the other gold . <br> A circle 's round , it has no end . <br> That 's how long I want to be your friend . <br> I crossed my heart when I told her that things would be just like always , that I 'd call her every day , that we 'd see each other every week , that things would never change  --  but my mind was already racing forward to my new life . <br> Months passed . I never called Brianna every day like I said I would , never saw her once a week . When we met up again in high school , we were strangers . She 'd traded in her pigtails for a crucifix , and we were way past the years when Madonna made that ironic . We had spoken less than six words to each other in those four years . <br> But who cares about all that , right ? I 've forgotten all that . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a terrible friend I always have been and always will be . Because I was n't thinking about keeping old friends that first day at Peterson ; I was only thinking about making new ones who would worship me the same way Brianna had . But who ? I thought , as our fourth-grade teacher Mr. Donovan called me and three other students to the board to solve a long-division problem . Through a haze of chalk dust , I watched as a girl with light brown hair finished her equation seconds before me , the first time I 'd ever been beaten . Her hair was long and shiny , not a snarl in sight , and when I looked at her wiping the dust off her jeans , expecting to see a smug gloat , I was shocked to see a shy smile instead . Realizing that this Lea DeAngelis girl could be my true north in this sea of strangers , I returned her smile and accepted defeat gracefully . <br> For now . <br> Continues ...           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
