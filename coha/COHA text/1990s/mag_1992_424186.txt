Section : watercolor PAGE <p> Wisconsin artist Mary Alice Wimmer says she suddenly became selfish in the late 1980s . Wimmer felt that her different and at times conflicting roles of mother , homemaker , associate professor of art , and artist needed to be rearranged to give her own art priority . As a result , her paintings of the last four years can be seen as symbols of her struggle to establish an equilibrium between the opposing forces in her life . She expresses this balance in her paintings by creating a tension between a very precise technique and a subject that is full of ambiguous and contradictory meanings  --  food . <p> Food evokes a diversity of complex and often contrary concepts and associations , among them indulgence and moderation , beauty , tactility , and the metaphorical . Food is simultaneously sensual ( Wimmer says , " I love its ripe , pulsing , bulging sensuousness " ) and practical ( " it 's what keeps us alive  --  it 's really basic , " she says ) . Yet she distances the viewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still lifes that exist in an ideal realm , where oral gratification is unattainable . You look at the food , but you can not consume it . <p> Watercolor has become her preferred medium because , she says , " the light coming from the paper is the same as the luminosity I see in food . " Unlike oil painting , watercolor demands restraint if an artist is to achieve luminosity and clarity . With Wimmer 's work , precise control of the medium serves as a foil to the sensual aspects of her subject . <p> Wimmer responds both visually and intellectually to her subjects . For instance , in Winter Still Life #1 and Winter Still Life #2 , she captures the tactile and volumetric quality of the pears and lemons and accurately records their surface imperfections . Yet the fruits seem to be more than just objects ; they assume an anthropomorphic quality as they nestle into the folds and creases of the tablecloth , which itself suggests the comforting domesticity of rumpled sheets or the grandeur of hills in a landscape . The exuberant fertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willendorf or other archetypal forms . Wimmer juxtaposes the organic forms of the fruit with geometric silver cups and then links the two by means of reflections . The new forms , which appear on the hard , shiny surfaces of the cups , are a blend of both fruit and cups . <p> When a local restaurateur commissioned Wimmer to paint The Good Life #1 , the artist needed to find a balance that would please herself as well as the client . To accommodate the client 's desire that the picture convey the impression of a person about to sit down at a table to eat , Wimmer selected a high vantage point . But considering its intention , the painting seems somewhat subversive . The more you look at it , especially when you examine its details , the more disturbing it becomes . No joy surrounds this static spread , which seems intended for a lone diner . The red snapper is uncleaned and raw , and the bottle of wine is unopened . Most disturbing are the intense red veins of the Swiss chard that appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work by the twentieth-century Mexican painter Frida Kahlo . When you look at these veins , you feel more like a voyeur than a diner . <p> Wimmer always tries to capture the vitality of life to make the food appear as alive as possible . Since heat destroys the natural color and intensity of food , she prefers to paint it uncooked . While painting The Good Life #1 , she had to shuffle the fish in and out of the freezer to keep it from spoiling . In addition to keeping food in its most natural state , she uses complementary colors abundantly , in this case the red fish against the green chard . The objects and the colors become metaphors for her feelings about life . She frequently paints the background black for formal and emotional reasons . In her paintings , black emphasizes silhouettes and intensifies colors while creating a mysterious , nocturnal mood . The artist realizes , however , that the black ground can become a crutch . ( To preserve the freshness of her colors , she layers the pigments on the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been influenced by the Dutch and Spanish Masters of still life as well as contemporary artists such as Claudio Bravo , Janet Fish , Sondra Freckelton , and James Valerio . She has taken workshops with Fish and Freckelton . However , her sensibility seems closest to the severe , restrained Spanish Masters ; her work calls to mind a still life by Juan Sanchez Cotan ( 1561-1627 ) in which fruits and vegetables are suspended on strings like musical notations in front of a dark void . <p> Wimmer begins a painting by setting up a still-life arrangement . After deciding on the horizon line by moving up and down in front of the setup , she makes a drawing the same size as the final work . Occasionally , she uses photographs to help with the placement of the shadows , especially if the food is going to spoil quickly . Using an HB or F pencil , she traces the drawing and then transfers it onto Arches 300-pound cold-pressed paper . During this process , she uses a red or other colored pencil so that she knows which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper . Since all the compositional adjustments have been made on the preliminary drawing , the final surface remains pristine . <p> The artist then concentrates on duplicating the perceived color as closely as possible . When painting adjacent areas , she avoids layering . However , she does layer color , where necessary , to intensify or increase contrast . Working methodically , she brings each object almost to completion before starting the next . <p> Wimmer insists there is no disguised symbolism in her paintings , even in works such as The Good Life #1 , which abounds with the traditional Christian symbols of fish bread , and wine . " I do n't intend any kind of moralistic meaning , " she says . " I want to be positive and glory in the objects themselves . I do n't want to paint things that shake you up but rather things that confront you  --  as Matisse 's easy chair does . " She adds that her still lifes contain no social content or criticism but are meant to portray an ideal . None of the objects in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transitory nature of life . Nonetheless , many of her paintings do have an understated , disquieting mood . <p> Le Zebre is one of her paintings that does not suggest any uneasiness . Instead , it expresses her love of pattern , fabric ( as an undergraduate she wrote a paper on Coptic textiles ) , and reflections . The bright copper pots reflect everything around them . She indicates that in future works she plans to include her face in the reflections . <p> Pleased with The Good Life #1 , the same restaurateur commissioned The Good Life #2 . In this painting , Wimmer used bread baskets , salt and pepper shakers , and copperware from the restaurant to create a correspondence between art and life , between what the patron sees and what he or she uses . Always seeking a contrast between order and anarchy , Wimmer countered the precise rhythm of the plates with loose , haphazard details such as the Tabasco sauce lying on its side instead of standing upright . <p> Although Wimmer 's paintings appear to be realistic , she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important consideration is what works in the painting . For instance , to prevent The Good Life #2 from becoming too busy , she eliminated the cast shadow from one of the lobster 's antennas . Similarly , she adjusted the scale of the salt and pepper shakers to make them more prominent . Wimmer says , " I try to make the painting better than reality . Why bother if you ca n't improve on what 's there ? A photograph of the same setup would really disappoint me . " On some occasions , she simply invents things . For instance , the marble slab in The Good Life #2 , so evocative of a bistro sideboard , is a fiction . <p> Preoccupied with the dualistic nature of life , Mary Alice Wimmer continues to explore the middle ground between freedom and control and between feeling and discipline . Although she loves breaking rules , she still insists on technical mastery . And despite her self-proclaimed selfishness , she continues to juggle competing priorities . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Six Graphs Porto , 1992 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lake Delton , Wisconsin . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Above : The Good Life #2 , 1991 , watercolor , 29 x 72 .
