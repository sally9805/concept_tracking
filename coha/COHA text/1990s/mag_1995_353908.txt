JUST BEFORE THE SENATE VOTED last week on its welfare-reform bill , New York 's Daniel Moynihan , who had engineered his own revision in 1988 , demanded a bit of rare institutional solemnity . Since most of his fellow Democrats would be embracing what he considered a historic betrayal of the poor , the Senators should rise in turn from their desks to announce their votes aloud . But Moynihan was one of the few who bothered to stay at his seat during the voting . Democrats milled around . Republican Senators engaged in a round of celebratory backslapping with the 20 or so House members , including Speaker Newt Gingrich , who made a rare visit to the Senate chamber . Moynihan sat there with the pinched expression of a man watching the old certainties of his party expire without so much as a moment of silence . <P> And it was a moment worth marking  --  a clear signal that when it comes to protecting the poor , the party of the New Deal and the Great Society ca n't and wo n't do much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though the Republican welfare bill was far harsher than the reform Bill Clinton proposed last year , which envisioned billions of dollars in new spending for job training and child care , the President pronounced the Senate plan acceptable . All but 11 of the 46 Senate Democrats voted for it . <P> Effectively cutting loose the poor was just part of an effort by the Democrats to remake themselves in the face of a Republican juggernaut that is now racing through Medicare . As they prepare for a bitter battle over that crown jewel of the Great Society , Democrats are determined to refashion themselves as defenders of the middle class against the G.O.P. raiders . It was the foul mood of the middle class that made welfare a losing issue for Democrats . And for the same reason , with pocketbook issues dominating the final weeks of the congressional budget fight , the latest items on the Republican agenda could now play in favor of the Democrats . <P> Sensing their chance , Democrats are showing an unaccustomed unity . Whether it 's Medicare , Medicaid , student loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor keep more of their paychecks , the usually fractious Democrats in Congress are arguing in unison that the G.O.P. does n't just want to balance the budget . Rather , the Republicans want to rob the middle class to pay for a tax cut that will give most of its benefits to people who already have plenty of money . <P> Meanwhile , on a combined speaking and fund-raising tour last week , Clinton spent most of his time playing up his differences with Republicans on the same issues , always emphasizing the costs to middle-class voters . As a Clinton aide put it , " He 's road testing new material . ' ' Even on Medicaid , the health-care program mostly for the poor that Republicans propose to hand back to the states , Clinton has been warning that the G.O.P. plan threatens government support for long-term care , leaving baby boomers to contend with their parents ' nursing-home bills . " I do n't think that 's right ' ' is a big applause line .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
