All those witnesses the prosecutor is gon na call will tell you so . Willie Moore killed Avery Clark . So now that we all know , why do n't we just save the taxpayers a lot of time and money and find the guy guilty as charged right here and now and send him up to San Quentin and gas him ? That 's what we all know is gon na happen anyway . He turns to Willie . &nbsp; HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIE &nbsp; WILLIEUh. . . right .

McNeil is on his feet .  --  42  --  &nbsp; MCNEILYour Honor , I must protest ! &nbsp; CLAWSONI kinda figured you would . &nbsp; MCNEILYour Honor , this is absurd .

This man spent three years in solitary confinement , during which time no one had any influence over him , because no one had any contact with him . He came right out of solitary to a shower , he went right from there for a haircut and right from there into the dining hall . One convict spoke one sentence to him , Your Honor . That is hardly enough to make someone a co-conspirator ! 54 ANGLE ON HENRY &nbsp; HENRY ( to himself ; smiling ) Whap. . . there goes the trap , Dad . &nbsp; CLAWSONI 'm inclined to agree with the prosecution .

No one and nothing . . . He went into that dungeon a petty criminal who had never harmed or attempted to harm another human being in his entire life . . . And he came out a vicious , barbaric , maniacal murderer . A man who had been put into a kind of psychological coma . Within an hour of coming out of that hell hole , he did what would have been unthinkable to him only three years before . . . His only thought . . . was murder , his only impulse was murder . His first act was murder ! He was himself a murder weapon , but the hand that held the weapon and plunged it into Avery Clark 's throat belonged to someone else ! Forty years ago , a man named Dreyfus was on trial . And forty years ago Emil Zola stood before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the conspiracy of the general staff of the army of the republic of France . So , too , do I now stand before you and this jury and say that the conspirators are present in this courtroom today . I point to the associate warden Mister Glenn , the warden Mister Humson , and the institution known as Alcatraz and say , I accuse ! I accuse them collectively and individually . I accuse Alcatraz of the murder of Avery Clark ! I accuse Alcatraz of the torture of Willie Moore ! I accuse Alcatraz of practices more fitting to the Spanish Inquisition than the United States of America !  --  44  --  I accuse Alcatraz of something even more heinous than the murder of one man . I accuse the warden and associate warden and the institution known as Alcatraz of crimes against humanity ! Willie Moore will not be the only defendant here . Alcatraz is on trial !

Humson gets up and walks through the rail . Humson is the picture of kindness as he crosses to the stand . &nbsp; BAILIFFDo you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , in the matter now pending before this court , so help you God ? &nbsp; HUMSONSo help me God . &nbsp; BAILIFFBe seated . &nbsp; HENRYWarden Humson . . . Somebody wanted me to ask you some questions . . . You do n't have any children , do you ? &nbsp; HUMSONChildren ? No . . . I do n't see what that has . . . &nbsp; HENRYI just wondered . . . were n't the guards and the prisoners in fact , like a kind of family to you ? &nbsp; HUMSONWell I do n't know that . . . &nbsp; HENRYIn a book you wrote . . . you referred to the convicts as your children , in fact , and you likened your job to that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their character . &nbsp; HUMSONYes . I wrote that .  --  97  --  &nbsp; HENRYI have here a record of a prisoner named Johnson who did a total of fifteen hundred days in the lower cells , the hole , the dungeon . . . over a ten year period , for such offenses as not finishing all the food on his plate , having an extra pair of socks in his cell , keeping an untidy cell , smuggling food from the dining room , crumbs in fact , to a pet lizard . Is this what you mean about molding character . &nbsp; HUMSONNo , no , no. . . no . . . You're. . . you 're twisting things here . The isolation cells were simply a tool of a temporary nature for extreme cases within the general population . Moreover you make it sound like this prisoner did fifteen hundred days at one stretch for one infraction . That 's not true . Uh . . . no . . . Prisoners were held for nineteen days at a time . That 's all . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand days for not making his bed ? &nbsp; HUMSONBecause that would be absurd . &nbsp; HENRYOr inhuman ? &nbsp; HUMSONYes . That would be inhuman . &nbsp; HENRYWillie Moore did more than one thousand days in the dungeons . . . one thousand days in total darkness . . . not nineteen days . . . but one thousand days with only thirty minutes of daylight a year ! &nbsp; HUMSONYes , but he tried to escape . You can not compare his offense with that of smuggling food to a lizard !  --  98  --  &nbsp; HENRYNor , possibly , could you compare its effect ? &nbsp; HUMSONI do n't know what you mean . &nbsp; HENRYThis was the first time a sentence of three years in the hole had been imposed , was it not ? &nbsp; HUMSONIt was n't a sentence . It was an administrative decision . &nbsp; HENRYTo put him in the hole for three years ? &nbsp; HUMSONNo , to place him there for an undetermined amount of time . &nbsp; HENRYAnd did you receive any petitions from Willie Moore during that time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you grant him an interview ? &nbsp; HUMSONInterviews were not allowed . &nbsp; HENRYWhy not ? &nbsp; HUMSONBecause that is part of the punishment . &nbsp; HENRYFor a man doing nineteen days , not three years ! It is a fact that you never considered a punishment of three years prior to putting Moore into the dungeon . It is a fact that you never considered not granting interviews for three years prior to putting Moore into the dungeon .  --  99  --  It is a fact that you simply put Willie Moore into the dungeon and washed your hands of him , forgot about him ! Why ! ? Why did you do that ? ! &nbsp; HUMSONI did n't ! That 's not true . &nbsp; MCNEILObjection , Your Honor . &nbsp; CLAWSONSustained . Henry crosses to the table and picks up a file . Henry crosses back to the stand . &nbsp; HENRYIs this your handwriting ? &nbsp; HUMSONYes . &nbsp; HENRYThis is dated three months before Willie Moore made his attempt to escape . You call Moore , and I quote , impulsive and unstable , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal integrity , which I take to be a good sign , which may enable him to learn self-control and obedience and may enable him to take his sentence one day at a time . If he does not learn to take his sentence one day at a time , he may become extremely dangerous . End quote . Did you believe that ? &nbsp; HUMSONYes , and subsequent events have proved me right . He did n't learn to take his sentence one day at a time and he became extremely dangerous and he killed a man ! &nbsp; HENRYTell me , how does a man take an indeterminate sentence in total darkness , with no human contact except beatings , wallowing in his own excrement for three years , one day at a time ?  --  100  --  &nbsp; HUMSONIt . . . I. . . the thing is . . . &nbsp; HENRYIs n't one of the effects of unrelieved darkness and lack of human contact a total disorientation and obliteration of a sense of time ? &nbsp; HUMSONIn some cases , but . . . &nbsp; HENRYHow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dungeon themselves have no idea how long they 're going to keep you there ? Where there is no differentiation between day and night , where even the beatings are random . Would n't that totally and completely obliterate a person . . . any sane person 's sense of time ? Is n't that possible ? &nbsp; HUMSONIt 's possible . Anything is possible . I try not to deal with possibilities . I deal with facts and hardened criminals . &nbsp; HENRY ( hot ) But the fact , Mister Humson , the cold , clear , brutal fact is that the person you stuck in that dungeon had never , never before in his entire life harmed or attempted to harm another human being . That is a fact , is it not ? &nbsp; HUMSONYes. . . but . . . he tried to escape ! Henry is rolling now . &nbsp; HENRYAnd it is equally a fact , Mister Humson , is it not , that when he came out this man , who had never harmed a living soul , was now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! You ca n't let them get away with that ! ! ! If we let them get away with that . . . where would we be . . . Should we let murderers run around on the streets . . . ?

Humson looks around wildly , trapped , unable to answer . &nbsp; HUMSONHe tried . . . He tried to escape . . . That 's the thing you see . . .

There is an awkward silence . &nbsp; CLAWSON ( quietly ) Mister Davidson . . . do you have any further questions of this witness ? &nbsp; HENRYNo , Your Honor . &nbsp; CLAWSONThe witness may step down . &nbsp; HUMSONHe tried to escape . . . &nbsp; CLAWSON ( continuing ; quietly ; almost kindly ) Mister Humson . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humson looks up , confused , and then slowly stands up and leaves the witness chair a dazed-looking old man . &nbsp; CLAWSONThis court is in recess until Monday morning at nine A.M.
