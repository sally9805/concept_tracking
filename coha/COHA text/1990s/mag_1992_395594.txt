As she opens the door to her Hollywood Hills home , her shy smile makes it instantly apparent that Jackee is the actress who created Sandra Clark , the voluptuous vamp of the now-canceled show 227 , and not Sandra herself . Soft-spoken and naturally pretty , without hair weave and excessive makeup , Jackee is nothing like her creation  --  " except for the fact that we both like men , " she quips . Almost on cue , one of the world 's better-looking ones  --  a cross between Denzel and Billy Dee  --  quickly departs Jackee 's house after being introduced . Five years ago , when Sandra was the country 's favorite Saturday-night date , Jackee was a megastar and an Emmy-award-winning actress . She commanded the best tables and the most attention , with her star entrances into chic restaurants wearing her trademark tight red-sequined dresses and matching stiletto heels . And she loved it . She was traveling on an admitted " star trip . " She went from hot to , if not cold , certainly cool almost overnight . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its kindness to casualties of failed TV shows . Friends fled , her phone calls suddenly went unanswered . When Jackee realized the party was over , she was left alone to clean up the mess . It has taken her two years to do so . " It 's been a tough time , " she says , shaking her head in disbelief but without a trace of self-pity . " I was famous for a minute , but now I 'm just known . The bad times made me take a good look at myself . They forced me to change and to grow . Before , everything was about work , career and me , in the most shallow sense of who " me ' is . Now I know that acting is what I do , but it is not who I am . Fame does not define or make me . Only I can do that . The tough times helped me gain a firmer grip on who I really am and what is truly important . I am more secure , more centered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns on that star trip of mine , but I 'm back on the right path now . Today I 'm happier with myself than I 've ever been . " The wrong turns led her to become the diva . She was demanding . If she was late , her attitude was : " Let them wait . " And wait they did , until it was decided that she was n't worth waiting for . She distanced herself from girlfriends with whom she had grown up and from family . Today , with renewed priorities and a wisdom born of pain , she has made her apologies to both friends and family and has " come home " to both . " Its been wonderful discovering that friends and family missed me almost as much as I missed them , " Jackee says . As she has tried to resurrect her career , Jackee , at nearly 37 , has discovered what it means to be a Black actress in America . " My mother refused to acknowledge racism and the fact that it could hinder me from achieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . " My horizons were never limited because I grew up thinking life would not be more difficult for me just because I was Black . In fact , for years when people would insist that Blacks , women and gays share a commonality I could n't understand it . Today I see that we are all viewed as second-class citizens . Opportunities for Blacks in film and television are severely limited . Why did it take me this long to learn that ? Because in all truth I never struggled in this business . Work and success always seemed to come looking for me rather than me looking for them . Now I find myself wondering where I fit in and what will come next . A top executive at CBS recently said to me : " With your talent you could be in any series . ' And I replied , " But I wo n't be because I wo n't get the opportunities . ' He did n't respond . He knew exactly what I meant . ' But opportunities are beginning to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Family after the death of its star , Redd Foxx , CBS hired Jackee to star opposite Della Reese . The hope is that the two actresses will be a winning combination . In April her first feature film , Ladybugs , in which she costars with Rodney Dangerfield , was released . There have been other offers , but she has rejected them all for the same reason : too blatantly sexual in content . " It 's one thing to have innocent fun with sex and Sandra Clark , but quite another to be asked to take off your clothes and simulate sex on-screen , " says Jackee . " I wo n't . I ca n't . Wrongly or rightly , I see myself as a role model for young Black women , and playing some sleazy slut is not my idea of taking that role seriously . Sometimes I think if I 'm ever to work again with merit and dignity , I 'll have to create and produce my own product , as Roseanne Arnold has . Dignity and respect for myself are the values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned if I 'll sacrifice them for any job . " Jackee was born the youngest of five children to Flossie Harry in Winston-Salem , North Carolina . Her father , Warren , died when she was 3 , and his death forced her mother to move to New York to search for work . She took her older children with her but left Jackee behind with an aunt . Jackee says she has no conscious feeling of abandonment or anger about her mother 's leaving . " She wrote and phoned regularly , visited when she could . I always knew she loved me , " Jackee says of her mother . Nonetheless , she recalls being an isolated child : " I spent much of my time alone , making up stories and glued to the television . " At 9 , Jackee joined her family in the Lincoln Houses , a low-income development in Harlem , after her mother had successfully established herself as a nurse 's aide . " Because I was the youngest , I got what I call the with children best drippings , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me , the baby , the best . I was well educated and very protected . " That protection extended to the all-girls ' high school she attended , where a team of supportive teachers encouraged her academically and personally . Their attitude was that Jackee could be anything . Her first acting role was as the king in the high-school production of The King and I. She recalls the all-girl audience cheering during her curtain call . " But my dream was to teach , " she says . She became a teacher after she graduated from Long Island University in 1975 , with a major in history . She taught high school and concurrently studied voice , but when she realized she " could never be as famous as Leontyne Price , " she turned to acting . For five years she studied at New York 's Henry Street Settlement with actor-director Dick Anthony Williams , who told her not to take an acting job until she finished his classes . She did n't . Instead , at 22 , she got married to a man whose name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She entered the marriage without much sexual experience . " I did n't even have sex until I was 18 , and then I did n't enjoy it , " she says , adding that she liked it even less the second time . " There was no kissing . Just a lot of this and that , which did n't do much for me . But because of how I then felt about my body , I had n't a clue about sexuality , particularly my own . " Her husband clued her in . " I never knew sex was to be enjoyed until that man . I was so ignorant that the first time I was in the joys of it , I thought I was dying or getting sick . " Although , she says , " that man treated me like a queen , " the marriage ended after four years . " I did n't know how to share or to give , " she says taking full responsibility for the demise of the marriage . " I actually left him to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doing . If he had n't convinced me that I was attractive , that I had something special to give the i world , I might never have left . " The world recognized her uniqueness immediately . After she was launched in her first play at the Henry Street Settlement , she quickly moved to Off-Broadway in Dark of the Moon and then to Broadway where she appeared in A Broadway Musical . Although the show bombed , Jackee exploded . She was soon cast in Eubie and One Mo ' Time , two hit Broadway shows . In 1983 Jackee was hired for what was little more than a bit part on the TV soap Another World . Her impact was so great that her few days ' work turned into nearly three years . During this time she taped the pilot for 227 , never thinking the show would sell . When it did , her agreement to do one show was stretched to seven episodes and then grew into a five-year commitment . During 1985 and 1986 she was bicoastal , doing both shows . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comedy series . That same year the tabloids were filled with rumors of a feud between her and Marla Gibbs , the show 's star and creative consultant . The feud was , of course , denied . " The first three years were actually great , " says Jackee . " When Sandra took off and I took off with her , the truth is it did indeed create a lot of tension . There were problems on Marla 's part , which was truly ridiculous because she had all the power . It was her show . Maybe the problem stemmed from the fact that from the beginning Marla wanted someone else for the part , but the network insisted on me . " They were all pushing Sandra , and they were pushing me . That changed when I got big , maybe too big , in Marla 's eyes . Not that Marla and I ever had any arguments . She was never rude to me , and we always remained cordial . But on the biggest night of my life , when I won my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , but there was also not a flower or a word of congratulations . Ever . There was nothing , and that hurt . Afterward , my part got less and less each week , and it became clear to me that it was time to leave and I did , " Jackee remembers . Gibbs emphatically denies that she ever had a problem with Jackee on 227 . She admits , however , that she had indeed wanted her daughter , Angela , or Rosalie Hooks ( daughter of actor Robert Hooks ) for the role of Sandra . " From the moment Jackee auditioned for the role of Sandra , with that prance and pout she invented , she was Sandra . She was spectacular , and I never felt competitive with her because I was the show 's creative consultant , " Gibbs says . " Problems occurred when the network wanted Jackee not just featured but starring in every show , and I could n't allow that . Not because I was the star , but because I was the producer and we were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider and protect if we were to remain a harmonious family of players . " Gibbs also maintains that she ordered flowers for Jackee when she was nominated for the Emmy . " I was going to surprise her on the set with them , but the flowers were delivered to her outside the studio by mistake . I do n't know to this day if Jackee knows I sent them . As for the Emmy night , well , I was hurt because I learned that her sister was giving an Emmy party and I was n't invited . None of us from the show was , so I guess you could say we all acted dumb because we all felt hurt . But I never stopped believing Jackee was funny , because she is funny , and she deserves every bit of success that comes her way . She 's earned it . Whether she knows it or not , I 'm in her corner . I always have been . " Jackee left 227 with six episodes remaining in the season , confident that her own show would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time there was yet another bomb  --  a marriage Jackee would prefer to disavow . " It was over and out the day after we married , " she says . " I literally woke up the morning after the wedding and thought , Girl , what have you done ? It was all about lust , not love . But it sure taught me to stay away from bass players , which is what both he and my first husband were . In fact , I swear there will never again be any kind of musician in my life , unless it 's some guy playing the harp up there in that Great Sky . " Her choices in men have almost always been bad , by her own admission . One man she dated sold " their story " to a tabloid after the relationship ended . Another , a stockbroker , had business cards printed , without her knowledge , that read : " Financial Advisor to Jackee . " Both men hurt her . " Friends said then , " Well , at least they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaceable and trust is not , " Jackee says . She admits that she is terribly afraid of being hurt again , which in part explains why she broke her engagement two years ago to her former acting teacher and mentor , Dick Anthony Williams . " I got scared , " she says . " I did n't think I could make it work . I did n't feel his equal . Dick is a brilliant man who was married for many years to a brilliant actress , who died . She was also my mentor . Frankly , I did n't think I had the stuff to follow her . I knew in my heart that , with all the changes I was going through , I just was n't ready or equipped to marry such a man . The prospect of having a third marriage end in failure frightened me out of my wits . I 'm happy , though , that he 's still a good friend . " Jackee is philosophical about the hurt she has experienced in her relationships . " Maybe that is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only who we are as women in relationships but also what our needs are . I honestly think that now , for the first time in my life , I know what kind of man and relationship I require . I need a man who wo n't take my shit . I can be very controlling , so I need a man who will be his own man because he has his own life and therefore wo n't be threatened by mine . A man who wo n't care that I might get distracted by work because his own will distract him at times . A strong man who wo n't be intimidated by my image , who can see beyond it all the way to me . That last thing is n't easy . Most men perceive me as having the attention of one man after another , and that makes them afraid to go out with me , be in a relationship , because they 're afraid they 'll get hurt . Being with a woman who is both famous and attractive can be very hard on a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You try not to fault a man for caving in to such pressures , but I do . " I do n't want to live alone or be alone , " Jackee says suddenly when reminded that she once said she could n't live with a man , that he would be too much of an interference in her career . Today Jackee says emphatically , " To hell with the career , which is just a fancy word for job . Yes , the business , a career , is important to me , but due to my changes , it 's not all that 's important anymore . I would like very much to get married again even though I continue to be afraid of marriage , afraid it will take away my identity . I have seen some women give up so much for a man and I do n't want to do that . But now I think , with the right man , I wo n't have to do that . " A relationship would make me a better person , " Jackee continues . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next job to focus on , and I need that for my own personal growth . It would also give me someone who would be there at night . I 'm afraid of the dark . I always have been . I 'm afraid of AIDS . Although I 've tested negative , there 's no guarantee I 'll still be testing negative six months or six years from now and that puts a chill up and down my spine . Putting it all together , I would like to be with one man  --  married , with children . With a family . " At 37 , Jackee knows her biological clock is ticking . " Honey , it 's thundering so loud the noise is positively deafening , " she says , laughing . " I so want a child , but I would never have one as a single mother because I believe a child needs two parents , and I would never have just one child . I want at least two , because the one thing I 've learned without question in my life is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pink slip that cancels it , family is always there . " Smiling she says softly , " So there 's been some heavy times . So what ? It 's because of them that I sit here today knowing exactly where I want to go because I can see so clearly exactly where I 've been . The days of my being impressed with Sandra Clark and the woman who portrayed her are gone . Today I 'm impressed with me . Just plain me . And that 's nice .
