Getting a child into college is stressful enough to make some parents fret over starting their kid off in the right preschool . But most families like to think there are a few years of grace time , with the dilemmas of carpooling and sports schedules not giving way to full frenzy until , at the earliest , the summer before senior year . <P> Well , that 's the way it is now . If you want to get a sense of the future , take a look at Achieva College Prep Centers , an education company . Give Achieva your child beginning in freshman year of high school , and the staff will help your teen pick classes , clubs , community-service projects and summer jobs , all with an eye toward creating a snazzy profile to present to college admissions directors . Achieva will tutor when your youngster falls behind and do the test prep to pull your kid ahead . The twentysomething counselors , who resemble the well-scrubbed models from a Gap ad , will even make a teenager , as adviser Tilden Fang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play and going to bed on time . <P> But all that pales beside Achieva 's birddogging of the senior-year college-application process . Advisers first help a student select 20 to 25 colleges , prodding the student along until he or she pares down the list to the eight or so to be considered seriously . Other kids may informally ask teachers for recommendations . Not with Achieva . Counselors help kids choose whom to ask for recommendations and then edit the cover letters and resumes that students are told to give to the chosen instructors . There 's even strategizing on the art of asking . " Make sure you ask for a strong letter . You have to say strong , " Elissa Hull , a counselor in Achieva 's Cupertino center , insists to senior Will Chen . If the teacher demurs , she says , Chen should yank back the request rather than end up with lukewarm praise . Achieva keeps its student records in files that look like doctor 's folders , with vitals  --  classes , test scores , deadlines and other information  --  regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help students conceptualize and write . And all this does n't end when the application is dropped in the mailbox . No , the last stop may be when Achieva counsels kids on setting up their freshman college schedule . <P> Test prep and tutoring have been around awhile , along with one-on-one private college counseling , services usually purchased by the wealthy . But the advent of Achieva signals something very different . The company is the first to join all three jobs in one program , micromanaging a student 's life . Achieva 's pitch is simple : while others boast they 'll increase a student 's grade by one letter or an SAT score by 100 points , Achieva says all of last year 's 1,050 clients got into college , and 85% ended up at one of their top two choices . In the past two years , the California company has boomed from one center to nine and plans to expand to 250 across the U.S. in the next 18 months . " We want to be a brand name like Coke , " says Carlos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
