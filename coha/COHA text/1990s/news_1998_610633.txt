<p> " The architect 's task is . . . to humanize the age of machines . " With these words by Alvar Aalto , the Museum of Modern Art introduces its centennial tribute to one of the century 's foremost designers . <p> Entitled " Alvar Aalto : Between Humanism and Materialism , " the major retrospective that opened last week builds a case for the late Finnish architect through a body of work never before collected in one venue . Fragile drawings , scale models and photographs of 50 projects were scouted and borrowed from four countries . Familiar bentwood furniture and undulating glassware came from the museum 's own collection . Full-scale constructions show off cobalt ceramic tiles and wedge-shaped bricks designed for Aalto 's curving walls . A bronze door handle , sculpted for right and left hands , is on display along with bentwood examples of a chair in progress . <p> To complete the experience , videos offer visitors a virtual walk through five of Aalto 's idiosyncratic buildings . Without distraction of sound , a camera catches the light as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pulp mill complex , a church , and Aalto 's own experimental country retreat , in which dwelling and nature are eerily merged . <p> " I really think he 's one of the great humanist architects of the 20th century , " says Peter Reed , the museum 's associate curator of the department of architecture and design , and an organizer of the exhibition that celebrates Aalto 's birth in 1898 . " He had great sensitivity to the human being . He was a sensual architect . " <p> Nowhere is that more evident than in the expressive waves of a molded and blown glass vase , designed by Aalto for a competition in 1936 and produced still today by Iittala , the Finnish glass company . Its free-form shape reminiscent of the lakes and bays of the Finnish landscape , in green , blue , amber or clear glass , has made Aalto more famous with a broader range of people than his buildings could . <p> " Most people know Aalto from his glass and furniture . They are almost astonished to learn that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was particularly excited to borrow the original poster-size drawings for the vase . ( A vase in the original sea foam green crystal was reintroduced for the centennial and sells at the MoMA Design Store for about $ 145 . ) <p> Washingtonians were treated to a preview of commemorative events two years ago , when the Embassy of Finland hosted an exhibition of Aalto-designed glassware and furniture , including the famed Zebra Lounge Chair , a cantilevered ribbon of laminated birch with zebra-pattern upholstery that sells for about $ 4,800 . <p> In furnishings , Aalto is viewed as the father of modern Scandinavian design , the aesthetic tie that binds contemporary sources from Jasper Morrison to Ikea and Crate &; Barrel . But the MoMA exhibition is a tribute to Aalto the architect . <p> In the firmament of Modernists , Aalto ranks with Frank Lloyd Wright , Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier . But he was a rebellious romantic among cool contemporaries , throwing curves at their machined white cubes . Aalto was inspired by the forests that define the Finnish landscape , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Marja-Riitta Norri , director of the Museum of Finnish Architecture in Helsinki , Aalto was never as widely admired in Finland as he was internationally . <p> For MoMA , the exhibition is the realization of an ambition that began long before Aalto 's death in 1976 to celebrate his contribution within his own century . The museum was assisted by historian Kenneth Frampton of Columbia University , the Museum of Finnish Architecture and the Alvar Aalto Foundation . The exhibition will travel to Tokyo and to Italy . <p> MoMA 's relationship with Aalto dates back to 1933 . The museum effectively put him on the world stage by including one of his projects in its seminal International Style show , which identified leaders of the European avant-garde . A one-man exhibition , " Alvar Aalto : Architecture and Furniture , " followed five years later , when both architect and young museum were coming into their own . <p> It was during that period that Aalto 's furniture gained notice abroad . Pieces were exhibited at London 's Fortnum &; Mason department store . <p> Scrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a project accomplished in 1933 . Adopting the perspective of the patient following his own recent hospitalization , Aalto designed everything from the quiet operation of a bedside sink to the cheerful glow of yellow linoleum floors to encourage a patient 's sense of well-being . <p> His concerns extended from the overall structure to the shape and height of door handles and the comfort of chairs , lacquered birch bentwood designs now in the museum 's collection . ( Made continuously by the Finnish company Artek , they are distributed in this country through International Contract Furnishings Inc . The MoMA store stocks one in black for $ 2,260 . ) <p> For the Viipuri City Library in Finland , his next project , Aalto 's focus was the comfort of the reader . A furnished model in the show makes it possible to imagine the delight of studying beneath rows of circular skylights , 57 in all , whose conical design was shaped precisely to eliminate shadows . The pattern overhead was echoed in rows of neat round stools , also still in production . <p> Apparent in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : natural materials against white ; natural and artificial light ; geometric and organic forms in opposition . The auditorium has a rippling wood ceiling that foreshadows the lines of the New York World 's Fair pavilion at the end of the decade that would cement his renown . <p> In the prolific period before World War II , Aalto produced a Finnish Pavilion for the Paris International Exhibition , where his bentwood furniture again had a foreign audience . So did the vases he had designed in a competition for Karhula-Iittala . The Iittala Glass Museum lent the three original drawings , which reveal that the vase named Savoy , for a Helsinki restaurant , was originally called " the Eskimo woman 's leather breeches . " <p> Aalto designed the Finnish Pavilion of the 1939 New York World 's Fair as a sinuous expanse of molded wood rising in three tiers . Images suggest a visitor might have felt like a Lilliputian inside a giant Aalto vase . Upon visiting , Frank Lloyd Wright is said to have declared : " He is a genius . " <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then Aalto 's Villa Mairea is his answer to Wright 's famed Pennsylvania house in Fallingwater . Villa Mairea was built for long-time patrons and friends Maire and Harry Gullichsen in Noormarkku , Finland between 1938-39 . He described it as a work of love ; it was also a prototype for dwellings in a classless society of the future . <p> Part modern ocean liner , with metal handrails , part Finnish peasant cottage in wood , with Japanese influences , it perfectly reflected the lives of its owners , according to their son , Kristian Gullichsen , chairman of the Alvar Aalto Foundation in Helsinki . His mother was an art collector , his father a lumber magnate . Thus , the staircase , suspended between birch-like poles , became a metaphor for the forest , the interiors were a three-dimensional play on cubist forms . <p> Gullichsen recalls moving into the house at the age of 7 , but the play of light , volume and natural materials failed to make their mark on the child . " What I was most impressed by was the boiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ocean liner . <p> He lived in the house only from September through November , 1939 , when war interrupted the family idyll . Afterward , " the purpose for which the house was built did n't exist anymore , " he says . It remained in the family , becoming a foundation after his parents ' deaths . <p> The war years created masses of refugees as borders shifted in Finland . ( The Viipuri library found itself in Russia after 1945 . ) Aalto responded to the crisis with emergency prefab housing designs . <p> In the exhibition catalogue , published by Harry N. Abrams ( 320 pp. $ 55 ) , Gullichsen writes of the postwar period : " When the weapons were finally silenced , the world had changed , and so had Alvar Aalto . He never returned to his architectural gold mine of the prewar period . The contemporary spirit in his work was replaced by glances at the past and reflections of the classical heritage . . . . " <p> Terence Riley , chief curator of the museum 's department of architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leader of the second generation of modern architects . <p> Aalto designed just two buildings in the United States , including the Baker House dormitory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( 1946-49 ) , where he taught during the 1940s . Its distinctive wave shape echoes the river beside it . He also designed the Mount Angel Abbey Library in St. Benedict , Ore . ( 1964-70 ) , remarkable for its pristine , light-filled reading room . <p> Norri points out that Aalto in his writings did not explain his designs , leaving people to experience the interaction of light and space in his buildings . He did write that " architecture can not save the world , but it may serve as a good example . " <p> The exhibition runs through May 19 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York . 212-708-9400 . Alvar Aalto furnishings are offered through the MoMA Design Store . 800-793-3167.
