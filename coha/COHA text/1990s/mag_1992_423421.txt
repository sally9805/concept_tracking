<p> They arrived behind bars , imprisoned and hand fed . When released , they flocked to mountain and big-city hideouts creating havoc among the local residents ( pigeons ) and unsuspecting tourists ( migratory birds ) . <p> Although it might sound like a plot from a Hitchcock thriller , it is the real life scenario of one of nature 's most revered predators , the peregrine falcon , ( Falcoperegrinus , from the Latin for wandering ) . Now nesting on the Tappan Zee Bridge , Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and Throgs Neck Bridge , and on Wall Street towers , the peregrine has reconquered its traditional airspace . After an absence of nearly three decades as a " local , " the federally endangered peregrine falcon , like its human neighbors , struggles to make its living in the Big Apple . <p> In 1983 , two peregrine eyries ( nests ) were discovered in New York City . Since then , New York State 's peregrine falcon population has grown steadily . Our most recent figures show 14 breeding pairs with 29 hatchlings . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DDE residues caused eggshell thinning , altered reproductive behavior and death . Hacking programs in the seventies and eighties released more than a thousand captive raised young in the East , 159 of those at over a dozen hack sites in New York . As the peregrine falcons returned and the population grew , the need for hacking diminished and releases ended in New York State in 1988 . <p> When the first two pairs of peregrine falcons in New York State were discovered nesting on the Verrazano-Narrows and Throgs Neck bridges , many people were surprised . Although several historic haunts still existed in New York City , it seemed that the more remote , historic cliff eyries available to the birds in the Adirondacks were somehow more appropriate to these streamlined masters of the sky than the underside of a busy commuter bridge . However , the city offered abundant prey in the form of pigeons , blue jays , starlings and other bird species and a unique array of buildings and bridges resembling natural cliff sites . It was soon discovered that this new population of peregrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Adirondack residents did not have to wait long for nesting , as five young peregrines were hatched at two historic Essex County cliff eyries , just two years after the species return to the city in 1985 . Since then , a total of 27 young peregrines have been hatched at these two Adirondack eyries . With the discovery of two productive eyries on Lake George in 1991 , the upstate peregrine falcon population has increased from two pairs in 1985 to a high of nine pairs present in 1990 and seven breeding pairs in 1991 . After the release of 103 captive raised falcons in the Adirondacks , eregrines could finally be seen feeding and caring for young at eyries that had been empty for almost 25 years . <p> Meanwhile , the New York City peregrine population increased too , spreading to buildings like the New York Hospital - Cornell Medical Center where the birds nest on a ledge overlooking the East River and F.D.R. Drive and to beautiful historic sites like the Riverside Church on Manhattan 's upper west side . The Tappan Zee Bridge , farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Of 10 downstate falcon pairs in 1991 , seven bred , hatching 15 young , just over half the statewide total . To date , a total of 127 young peregrine are known hatched in the state , with 116 of those believed to have fledged ( flown ) from the nest . Fifty-four of the 62 downstate young fledged , and 62 of 65 upstate nestlings fledged . <p> Downstate Eyries <p> Although quite unlike the relatively undeveloped Adirondack terrain , New York City provides the peregrine with all of life 's necessities . In fact , the peregrine is not the only flying predator found stooping by windows . Often confused with the peregrine , the American kestrel ( Falco sparvarius ) is a smaller falcon and more common city resident that finds the nooks and crannies of old building architecture an ideal home . <p> Among the nine known New York City sites with territorial pairs in 1992 , only four have been consistently successful : VerrazanoNarrows Bridge , Throgs Neck Bridge , New York Hospital ( Cornell Medical Center ) and Riverside Church . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past three years . Eggs laid on an upper floor ledge 810 feet above the sidewalk have been spontaneously abandoned by the adults . In 1991 the nesting female laid one egg on each of three different ledges . Following the laying of the third egg , the male and female were each seen attempting to incubate a single egg on two different ledges - a very unusual situation . The incubation attempt ended shortly afterwards without success . <p> Since falcons do not build nests , the flat ledges on buildings and bridges are often unsuitable without some modification . in the wild they lay their eggs in a shallow depression or hollow called a scrape in whatever substrate is present . Unfortunately , the ledges the falcons had selected on the Pan Am Building Contained many hazards to the eggs , such as sharp debris that might have pierced the shells , little protection from rolling off the flat surface and disturbance from construction . A nesting box installed in 1990 , courtesy of Pan Am officials , on a south facing ledge , remains unused . Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season and protection from human disturbance may increase the chances for a first time nesting success . Cooperation from the management of the Pan Am Building has allowed DEC direct access to the nesting area while affording the birds protection from disturbance . <p> In addition to obtaining superb cooperation from various building and bridge management personnel , DEC depends greatly on the efforts of volunteers . From all walks of life , these volunteers provide help ranging from collecting valuable information on breeding behavior and assisting with banding operations to improving public relations . Saul Frank , a retired state employee , and his wife Delores are volunteers who have been enjoying the day-today activities of Queen and Rio at the Throgs Neck Bridge since 1983 . This pair is thus far , New York State 's most successful pair . Saul keeps a logbook of peregrine activity throughout most of the year and notifies DEC of any unusual activity around the nest . Throgs Neck Bridge maintenance supervisor , Pete Logan , and other bridge officials have provided the birds protection and allowed DEC biologists access to place a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . <p> The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge peregrines control all aerial passage from Brooklyn to Staten Island . Perched atop one of the bridge 's 700 foot towers , the falcons , named Whitney and Amann after the bridge designers , collect their meals instead of tolls as resident and migratory prey birds attempt crossing . Bridge officials Jim Fortunato and Ron Monk see to it that all personnel , including private contractors , are educated on the peregrines . During a roadway inspection , bridge maintainer Tom Gorgia found the mangled remains of one of three young hatched in 1991 on the surface of the roadway . As sad as this situation was , DEC is grateful for the recovery of any carcasses of young birds as information on mortality is especially crucial at a nest site . <p> Along mid-town Manhattan 's east side , the New York Hospital 's Baker Tower , constructed during the Great Depression , was a former haunt of the peregrine . Dr. John Aronian , an assistant professor of surgery at the New York Hospital , has helped DEC officials manage this nesting pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions , Dr. Aronian has assisted with banding operations and has occasionally encountered situations where his direct actions have helped rescue young falcons . Another devoted falcon guardian is New York Hospital 's archivist , Adele Lerner , who has designed a peregrine falcon display for public viewing . A complete genealogy of the current pair has been outlined along with numerous falcon family photos . Not only do the falcons have a strong fidelity to their nest locations , but many dedicated volunteers and interested persons have a similar attachment to their falcons . <p> Bordering the western rim of Jamaica Bay , a new pair of falcons now governs New York City 's fertile barrier beach , the Rockaways . These peregrines , a pair of siblings , offspring from a 1989 nest at the New York Hospital , found a home overlooking Brooklyn 's south shore . Although they successfully nested for the first time in the spring of 1991 , tragedy struck this pair during the nesting period . In nearby Floyd Bennett Field at Gateway National Park , the adult female , named Kay , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was apparently struck by a vehicle along one of the former airstrips in the park . <p> Following the death of Kay , her mate Little John continued to feed and fend for the two young nestlings . Approximately two weeks shy of taking their first flights , both young fell out of the nest prematurely . DEC was assisted by volunteers , the National Park Service , TBTA workers and the U.S. Coast Guard , and both young were safely retrieved , banded and placed in a temporary nesting box installed close to the original nest . Thanks to the keen eyes of observers , neither bird was struck by a vehicle or drowned in Rockaway Inlet . There is more good news for one of New York 's most desirable bachelors as Little Jobn has since been observed paired up with a new adult female wild produced at an eyrie on an artificial tower in Virginia in 1990 . <p> North Country Nests <p> To visit a classic Adirondack peregrine eyrie , one does not have to get far off the beaten track . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City , you can still observe falcons from the convenience and comfort of your car or without a long hike . Several sites in Essex County fit this description , and are well known to local bird clubs and climbers . The areas are posted during the nesting season with certain climbing routes closed to prevent disturbance to the birds and danger to the climbers . Adult peregrine personalities vary considerably from pair to pair ; many will aggressively attack human intruders during the nesting season . A careful , patient observer can see the entire breeding cycle of courtship to dispersal beginning in March and ending in July or August . <p> Peregrines generally breed at two years of age , laying a clutch of three or four eggs , occasionally five or six , in the scrape on the cliff ledge . The downy young hatch after about 33 days of incubation and fly at about six weeks of age . They progress fairly rapidly in acquiring their hunting skills , chasing first after butterflies and other insects and then advancing to larger avian prey . <p> Prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a very important part of the peregrines diet . The Adirondack peregrines may depend more on migratory species for food . it is generally thought that migratory bird species such as shorebirds and many perching birds ( passerines ) should contain higher levels of organochlorine pesticides than resident species such as pigeons that feed mainly on grains and do n't undergo long-distance migrations . However , sampling studies in New Jersey and New York indicate local contamination of food chains from historical applications of organochlorines may continue to affect reproduction . <p> At one of Manhattan 's more recently successful eyries ( productive since 1989 ) , the Riverside Church , Chris Nadareski is studying the levels of organochlorine pesticides in the diet . About two out of three birds eaten by this pair during the breeding season appear to be pigeons , a nonmigratory prey relatively free of contaminants such as DDT and its metabolite DDE . Unfortunately , because pigeons feed near roadways and on structures that may contain lead paints , increased levels of lead are often encountered in this species . Although this nest may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in unhatched eggs along with dangerously thin eggshells . DEC 's wildlife pathology unit found high levels of organochlorine pesticides in a dead adult female peregrine , just 13 miles south of the Church at the Venrrazano-Narrows Bridge . It was one of two adult females found dead at this eyrie since 1983 in addition to a third adult female that mysteriously disappeared . Whether from current applications on the wintering grounds in Central and South America or from local Hot Spots , these contaminants have persisted despite restrictive bans implemented in this country nearly two decades ago . <p> Of four main geographical regions the peregrines once inhabited ( before 1960 ) in New York , only two have been resettled at present . The Shawangunk Mountains and Hudson River Palisades do not yet have breeding peregrines . Why the falcons have settled in New York City while the nearby Hudson Palisades remain empty ( except for the Tappan Zee Bridge ) , remains open to scientific discussion . <p> High levels of DDE and PCBs along with increased predation may be factors . In 1991 , three unhatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained elevated DDE and PCB levels , and showed very high levels of eggshell thinning . To add to this already bleak situation , a local naturalist found bones and feathers of an adult peregrine floating in the Hudson River during the summer of 1991 . These remains are suspected to be that of the male from the Tappan Zee Bridge , and if so , the bird 's loss may have contributed to nesting failure that year . <p> Management Issues <p> The growing peregrine falcon population , largely the end product of years of costly , intensive management , will continue to require attention for years to come . To ensure the survival of this relatively small population of peregrines in New York State , DEC must continue to protect and monitor them . Nest boxes at city eyries need to be constructed and maintained ; bridge and building maintenance needs to be accomplished without undue disturbance to the falcons . Additionally , other historical nesting areas , such as the Hudson River Palisades and the Shawangunk Mountains , need to be monitored for peregrines . In the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mohonk Preserve staff assisted DEC in conducting an intensive survey in the mountains near New Paltz to locate any peregrine falcons in the area . The information obtained during such surveys may provide insight as to why the peregrines are using some historic nest sites and not others , and whether or not the suitability of unused sites can be increased . <p> Volunteers have done a tremendous job of reporting and monitoring nesting pairs and assisting with everything from banding of young to carcass retrieval . However , the peregrine is still vulnerable and could be a victim of its own popularity . Too many observers at critical times during the nesting season can negatively affect the falcons ' breeding success . At the same time , opportunities to observe this fascinating raptor safely need to be made available . <p> The effect of pesticides and pollution on the peregrine falcon population are still a concern . The effects of recent oil spills under the Outerbridge Crossing and Goethals Bridge , which killed hundreds of birds the resident peregrines prey on , remain to be seen . Continued sampling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items will be necessary . <p> Looking Ahead <p> We 've come a long way since the first peregrine falcons were released in New York State in the mid 1970 's , and since the first birds returned to breed in 1983 . It is reasonable to expect that the peregrine population will continue to increase , until some unknown limit set by environmental restrictions is reached . DEC and DEP will continue to depend on an army of volunteers to report new eyries and help with the day-to-day protection and caretaking at nests throughout the state . <p> One thing is for certain - we must never take for granted that peregrines will prosper . With sound management , continued research and a little luck , the peregrine will continue to flourish . <p> Photo : Watching for peregrines near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge <p> Photo : Male peregrine perches on a bronze eagle at the Bank of New York <p> Photo : Male peregrine at the Marine Parkway Bridge <p> Photo : Female at nest box on Throgs Neck Bridge ( D.
