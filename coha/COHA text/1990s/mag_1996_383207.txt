Celebrate the sweet smell of success at a shrimper 's family feast . Photograph // On a radiator-hot south Louisiana morn , shell-lined , bumpy roads sizzle and twist their way through Houma into Bayou Cocodrie ( " Crocodile Bayou " ) . Restless katydids in surrounding mangrove trees harmonize like rattlesnakes until the thick , salty air shatters with the roar of a shrimpboat engine . The West Wind chugs away from the marina . On board , shrimper Jimmy Lirette has high hopes for netting a good week 's work . " My dad was a shrimper , " Jimmy says with a heavy Cajun accent , as he squints skyward at the seagulls taunting his gurgling boat . His tanned face and cool blue eyes boast years of storytelling . " He taught me how to make nets and chart the best course . But he caught a stroke when I was 9 , and I left school to work his boat . It 's been in my blood ever since . " After service in the U.S. Army , Jimmy worked on land for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an art that not everybody can do , " he says proudly . Thirteen years ago , he bought his own boat and named it the West Wind after one his wife , Jane , had admired in an Elvis Presley movie . " Hey , if it was good enough for the king of rock ' n ' roll , well , " he laughs . After long days skirting the eastern Louisiana coast , Jimmy brings home the treasure : loads of fresh shrimp to sell to local distributors . But some of it , he saves . " You know how it goes , " Jimmy says " Laissez les bon temps rouler let the good times roll and all that . Let 's eat ! " At an outdoor shrimp feast celebrating the bayou harvest , Jimmy and Jane join close relatives and friends Lee and Jeanette Usie and E. J. and Genie Usie , at Lee 's home in Houma . Jimmy 's daughter and mother soon arrive , as do neighbors and more relatives . While shrimp and corn come to a rolling boil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shrimp Puffs , Shrimp-and-Potato Salad , Shrimp Creole . . . well , we wo n't do the Forrest Gump routine , but we will give you some terrific recipes perfected through many years of good eating . // BARBECUE SHRIMP // SHRIMP-AND-POTATO SALAD // SHRIMP-AND-POTATO SALAD // SHRIMP CREOLE // SHRIMP PUFFS // SHRIMP PUFFS // SHRIMP FETTUCCINE // <p>
