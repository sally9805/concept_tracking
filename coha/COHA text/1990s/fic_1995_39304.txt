It was not the first time that Rabbi Yehiel Berman had had dealings with the media , but on all those previous occasions it had been what he classified as the " Anglo-Jewish press , " and to them he could comment in a kind of shorthand . By them he could count on being understood . Whatever was spoken was spoken within the walls of the family compound , as it were . He would be given the benefit of the doubt , and , ultimately , if necessary , he would be forgiven . But in the matter of the lost girl , Feigie Singer , and all the publicity attendant on that mess , it was no less than the mighty New York Times that had approached him , and Rabbi Berman had made the grievous error of taking seriously an unquestioned fact lodged many years earlier in his consciousness and accepted by him in innocent good faith  --  namely , the fact that the Times was a Jewish organ . <p> So when the Times reporter approached him for a comment on the Singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a brother , or at the very least a cousin . Because even a cousin several times removed would understand that there are two forms of speech  --  one meant for the inner precincts and the other for the outside sphere . And even that cousin , however many times cut off , would recognize that it is in their mutual interest to take the words spoken within the chambers and refine them for consumption by a hostile world where the one thing you could depend on was any excuse to pounce on the Jews  --  " All Jews irregardless , " as Rabbi Berman liked to put it , no matter how distant the cousinship . The least Rabbi Berman could have expected from that reporter , a Jewish fellow named Sean Markowitz , as a matter of fact , was to apply some basic common sense in the interest of Jewish survival . As Rabbi Berman admonished this traitor afterward , when it was already too late , when his so-called offensive remark had been spread far and wide in the newspaper without commentary or spin , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counseled Markowitz that he would do well in the future to recite the Shema with intense fervor , to pray " Hear , O Israel " each . and every time he sat down at his desk to write even a single word about the Jewish people , in order to remind himself of his awesome responsibility , his heavy burden , lest he do , as he had certainly done with the rabbi 's quote , severe harm to his own tribe and , by extension , whether he acknowledged this or not , to himself . <p> Above all , the rabbi had sought to drum a little empathy into the uselessly educated brain of this arrogant kid .. Do not judge your friend until you reach his place , the sages teach . And who , who in this world , could ever imagine what it must be like to be in Rabbi Berman 's position ? To be the principal of an all-girls high school , to bear the weight of molding and shaping , day in and day out , the minds and souls of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen , to be charged with preparing these specimens for the critical task of Jewish wifehood and motherhood , in short , for the continuation of our people  --  this was the hard reality hat Rabbi Berman had to face , a reality quite beyond the comprehension of the Markowitzes of this world . Did Markowitz realize , for instance , that by the age of twenty , God willing , most or all of these girls would already be married off to yeshiva boys who sit and learn all day ? Some were even engaged in their junior year of high school . A year at a women 's seminary in Israel after graduation , night classes at Brooklyn College , some secretarial work or maybe in computers , marking time , as it were , and then , with God 's help , they would be settled away . By twenty , many were already pushing a baby in a carriage down Thirteenth Avenue with another on the way , and if they were not fixed up by then it would truly be och und vey , a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a looming calamity in fact , because already a new crop of eighteen-year-olds would be coming up , and the chances these old goods had then of fulfilling the destiny that he , Rabbi Berman , and the institution he headed were preparing them for would be drastically reduced , reduced exponentially . <p> Now , was this a reality that Markowitz and his ilk could absorb ? Did Markowitz have even an inkling of an idea of what it meant to be in the rabbi 's shoes ? Statistically speaking , in any given week at the school , the rabbi had once calculated , approximately one quarter of these girls , about seventy-five girls in all , had their periods . Could anyone imagine what it must be like to be living in the middle of all that ? Sometimes he felt as if he were drowning in a thick soup . The constant smell of talcum , of old perspiration in woolen sweaters , the endless dieting and self-dissatisfaction , the pimples , the greasy hair , the preening , the sudden bursts of weeping , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kissing , the gossip , envy , rivalry , intrigue , the cliques , the moodiness , the obligation to chide this or that one for wearing makeup , shoes that made noise , colors that were too bright , sleeves that were too short , for snatching the excuse of warm weather not to wear any stockings at all  --  an obligation that naturally carried with it the necessity of looking closely at these growing girls when for the sake of the purity of his spirit he would ; of course , have preferred not to  --  all of this was a headache beyond description . <p> And , to make matters worse , if you did n't count the public high school teachers who came into the building in the late afternoon for the secular subjects , since all of the religious classes were taught by married women in wigs and head scarves and hats , he , Rabbi Yehiel Berman , was the only man on the premises the entire day , not including Reb Avraham Washington , the janitor . But Reb Washington was a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years , who had been so influenced and impressed by the Jewish lifestyle that he had actually converted , married the longtime secretary , the widow Mrs. Halpern , and now he could be seen in his full beard and side curls , shuffling around the facility with his mops and pails , wearing a black felt hat over his black velvet yarmulke and a great fringed ritual garment on top of his white shirt . Yet , in a very real sense , Reb Avraham Washington , no matter how sincere his convictions , could never really be considered a player , and , for all intents and purposes , he , Rabbi Yehiel Berman , was the only male on the scene . <p> So when the Singer girl had gotten lost that spring during the Lag B'Omer outing , when she had not come out of the woods after wandering for over an hour with all the other girls , when she had not returned to the buses waiting in the parking lot , when , to the rabbi 's utter astonishment , the disappearance of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hasidim in black garb from Massachusetts to Maryland , as well as other  --  secular  --  men , descending on these woods in upstate New York in search of this female and the whole business had become big news , this guy Markowitz from the Times naturally sought out Rabbi Berman , as the principal of the school , for a comment . Markowitz 's attitude had been openly hostile and confrontational from the outset . Was n't the rabbi aware that this particular forest was notoriously confusing , complex , overgrown , filled with traps and illusions ? How could he have allowed such young and vulnerable girls to wander in there alone ? What form of supervision had been provided for these students , city girls that they were , innocent entirely of raw nature ? <p> And even though Rabbi Berman knew that a wise man answers the first question first and the second second , everything in order , he hastened , in this instance , to take on at once the final query for which he had a ready response . There were fifteen chaperons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trained teachers from our school , one adult per every group of twenty adolescents . He did not add that the women had most likely remained in the parking lot , chatting in clumps  --  chatting , as usual , about this and that , about children , about where to get the best prices , comparing outfits  --  while the girls went off into the woods . He assumed that this had been the case , based on his past experience observing teachers in the yard overseeing students during free time , but why should he have volunteered such compromising information to Markowitz if he had not witnessed it with his own eyes ? Because , naturally , he himself had not gone on the trip with the student body due to the delicate and essentially forbidden circumstance into which he would have been forced  --  of riding in close quarters for such a long period of time in the exclusive company of the opposite sex . True , the bus drivers were male , but they , of course , were gentiles . <p> Then , having successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatically attempted to draw Markowitz closer , to establish some sort of bond of kinship between them , to bring him over to their side . " What kind of name is Sean for a Jewish boy ? " he inquired with amused familiarity . Most likely , the rabbi wen on to conjecture , he had been named for some ancestor called Samuel , Shmuel  --  Shmiel or Shmulik , in the Yiddish way . " So tell me , Shmulik , " the rabbi said , " when was the last time you put on tefillin since your bar mitzvah ? " <p> But Markowitz was n't buying . He persisted in questioning the rabbi , not only about the supervision for the trip  --  obviously he had found the answer unsatisfactory  --  but also about all the other arrangements and preparations , as well as about the steps they had taken upon discovering that a girl was missing , until , in exasperation , and , really , in an attempt , misguided perhaps but well intentioned nonetheless , to bring some relief , some lightness , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statement that had gotten him into so much trouble . " Look , Shmiel , " he said , " we went into the woods with 300 girls and came out with 299 . Now , you learned arithmetic . If you consider all girls equal , so that each one is worth the same amount of points , on a final exam that would give you a score of about 99.7 out of 100  --  a sure A , maybe even an A plus . Not a bad showing in anybody 's book  --  am I right ? " For this comment even members of his own community had chastised him , accusing him of insensitivity , of failing to place the proper value on one human life . Rabbi Yehiel Berman had been completely misunderstood . <p> And , after all , who was this girl Feigie Singer to inspire such a fuss ? Of course , she was a human being  --  that goes without saying . Naturally , she was not a nothing , God forbid . But such a small , timid creature , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fruit and vegetable truck , selling door to door , housewives bought from him out of pity  --  this was a girl who scarcely made any impression at all . You barely noticed her , she was hardly there even when she was n't lost . It was a wonder , in a way , that they even realized she was missing . In this assessment , which , thank God , the rabbi had had the good sense to refrain from verbalizing , he was nevertheless backed up by two student leaders , Pessie Glick and Dvorah Birnbaum , who told Markowitz that Feigie was an exceptionally quiet girl , afraid of every little thing , you could practically see her heart pounding and fluttering like a naked newborn chick under her blouse , definitely not the type to go wandering off alone in the woods . Oh , they were very worried that something terrible had happened to her , Pessie and Dvorah said . <p> She had , in fact , been walking with them when she disappeared , cowering and trembling at every little movement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Feigie was gone . The woods were extremely tangled and dark and moist . There was a man in there , they reported . They had seen him with their own eyes . Several times they saw him , though not while they were with Feigie . Later , only , after she had vanished . He was wearing a uniform of some sort  --  a forest ranger , they thought  --  rubber boots , a wide-brimmed hat with a leather band , a heavy wooden stick in his hand . They themselves circled aimlessly for another hour at least after Feigie disappeared , utterly lost and confused , clutching each other 's hand , before they had finally , thank God , seen a clearing of light and found their way out into the parking lot . <p> And these two girls , Rabbi Berman noted , Pessie and Dvorah , were from the school 's elite , from very good backgrounds , handsome , well-dressed girls . They would no doubt be married off within a year to excellent prospects from comfortable , well-connected families , families that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy sat and learned Torah all day and maybe studied at night for an accounting or an actuarial degree and the couple started a family of its own . Little Feigie Singer must have been honored , thrilled , to be allowed to walk in the woods in their company , alongside such important girls , Rabbi Berman was sure . Such , he knew , was the politics of a girls ' high school . If it had been the Glick or the Birnbaum girl who had disappeared , it would have been a different story entirely . Whether Markowitz realized it or not , he was getting his inside information from the most prestigious teenage source possible , the cream of the cream . What Pessie and Dvorah said to him should have put the status of the Singer girl clearly into perspective . So when the searchers brought Feigie Singer out of the woods nearly three days later , a little hungry , a little tired , a little soiled , but , to the uncritical eye , at least externally undamaged , it was a shock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to their entire school community for that matter , and it was a surprise even to the rabbi himself , he had to admit , that she was escorted out like a heroine , like a princess from an ancient tale . Yet even so , even though this meek girl had been welcomed like a celebrity when she was rescued , and masses gathered to dance and rejoice at her salvation , and even though Rabbi Yehiel Berman observed over the ensuing months that she had begun to grow considerably and to ripen , you should excuse me , in a recognizably womanly fashion , he had nevertheless regarded it as necessary at the time of her deliverance to urge her parents to collect notarized letters and affidavits from doctors and other examining authorities testifying to the fact that nothing compromising had happened to her during those days when she had been alone in the woods . This would be a wise precaution , Rabbi Berman had advised , in anticipation of the time , only a few years hence , when they would be seeking a suitable match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event and , naturally , they would pause and wonder . <p> When they found her in the early morning hours of the third day , she was inside the hollow shell of the dead tree trunk in which she had finally settled to await her fate . It was like a cradle , she imagined , high and protected on each side , soft and damp in the interior with decaying matter that peeled off and clung to her clothing , tangled in her hair , and when she curled up to sleep it seemed to her to be almost rocking . Her parents , of course , would have realized that she had not come home , but what resources could they muster to try to find her , downtrodden and careworn as they were ? They were not the kind of people who liked to call attention to themselves , and a daughter who does not return home , that was in a way a shameful thing , not something they would want to get around . Pessie and Dvorah would probably have noticed that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though while she was walking beside them in the woods they seemed hardly to have noticed her . They did n't even bother to shake her off or to lower their voices to whisper their secrets but went on chatting intimately with each other as if they were entirely alone . <p> They really were magnificent girls , Pessie and Dvorah , tall and stately , Pessie with her red hair streaming down her back , held with a black velvet barrette , Dvorah 's rich , dark curls framing the smooth paleness of her face . These were truly girls at the cusp of their bridal season , beautifully packaged , as it were , in designer clothing that their mothers single-mindedly hunted out for them from fashionable , bejeweled women in gorgeous blonde pageboy wigs who operated discount boutiques in the basements of their Borough Park homes . For her part , Feigie was wearing the long , drab , khaki-colored skirt and the well-washed blouse with the tiny yellow flowers and sleeves buttoned at the wrists handed down from her sisters , white socks , and sneakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ears , which her mother had insisted she have pierced , and the gold ring with the tiny amethyst birthstone that she had been given three months earlier , on her fourteenth birthday . Pessie had milky pearls in her ears , and Dvorah elegant gold hoops , and they were each carrying fine leather pocketbooks slung stylishly over their shoulders while she , Feigie , had all of her possessions for this outing  --  her cream cheese and jelly sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil , her old Instamatic camera , her little prayer book , and a few dollars  --  in a lump at the bottom of a plastic Waldbaum 's shopping bag that she clutched in her hand . <p> She could never imagine ever flowering as gloriously as they , even in three years time , even when she , too , would become a senior . She could never imagine ever being able to converse as amusingly or as easily or as confidently as they . How did they always know the right thing to say ? She walked along silently beside them , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to embarrass herself by starting at every sound and rustle in the woods , straining to keep up even though she was growing increasingly weary and alarmed as they penetrated deeper and deeper among the trees , her heart beating so that she was afraid they could hear it , a dragging ache radiating down her back , across her belly , into her thighs . <p> Would she ever possess the power to talk as fluidly , as brazenly about Rabbi Berman , for example , as they did ? It seemed to Feigie to be a veritable gift , quite beyond her . They actually called him Berman . Last week Berman had asked her if she was wearing stockings , Dvorah told Pessie . Would you believe ? He even put out his hand as if to slide it down her leg . Just checking , you know . Dvorah giggled . Had n't he ever heard of sheer panty hose , for heaven 's sake ? Yeah , Pessie said , just two days ago Berman stopped her in the hallway and told her that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was about to rip them right out of her ears . There was definitely something wrong with the guy . <p> What could Feigie possibly contribute to the conversation ? Rabbi Berman never looked at her , and ever since that one and only conversation she had had with him , when it had been her turn to be called into his office in the early autumn for the routine interview with each new freshman , she took pains to avoid him , ducking into classrooms when she saw him coming down the hall , staying out of his line of sight as much as was humanly possible . Without even looking up , he had indicated with his hand for her to sit down in the chair on the other side of his desk after she had knocked and come into his office that morning for the interview , and , with his eyes glued to the sheet of paper in front of him , he had said , " So , you 're the daughter of Moishe Singer the fruit man . Did n't we have a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are they married yet ? " Feigie could tell that Rabbi Berman did n't even remember her sisters ' names . Then he looked up , stared at her as if he were probing to her essence for an endless stretch of time , with his elbows planted on his desk and his bearded chin resting on a sling formed by his enlaced fingers and the bowl of his black velvet yarmulke tipped back exposing a half-moon of closely cropped gray hair , and finally , with his eyes still unyieldingly upon her , he had spoken . " So , tell me , Singer , " he had said , " what do you plan to do about those pimples of yours ? " For fifteen minutes after that interview , she had sat on a toilet in one of the cubicles in the third-floor bathroom , her shoulders heaving , sobbing into her two hands pressed against her mouth . She could never imagine Rabbi Berman saying such a thing to Pessie or to Dvorah . <p> With God 's help she could avoid him , she figured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when every graduating senior was required to take his course on the Laws of Family Purity . But that was a long time from now . Meanwhile she would try not to worry about it . And even then , when the time came , she could sit silently in a corner of the classroom , staring down into her lap . She would practice making herself transparent . He would not find her , he would not look for her . She was not interesting to him . This subject , those laws , were what Pessie and Dvorah were discussing now . " The main point , " Pessie was saying , " was that during those two weeks every month when you 're not allowed to  --  you know  --  the main thing , like Berman said , is not to do anything to tempt your husband . Like , to excite him . Men are different that way  --  you know what I 'm saying ? " " Yeah , " Dvorah responded , " but still you have to look good , even then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed with , like , cold cream or something smeared all over your face . " <p> The two girls nodded . They were passing through a small clearing in the woods , and a shaft of light filtered down through the trees . Two squirrels ran out directly in their path , chasing each other , startling them . For the first time , Feigie remembered the animals that must inhabit these woods . Yet all of this talk , the moment to which she was privileged , however frightening , however much her back and her legs hurt , this moment was stunning , like a revelation she could only partially comprehend . She listened as the two girls went on to analyze the significant members of their class , one by one , their looks and their personalities , their position in the group and their prospects , their good points and their bad , and then as they proceeded to scrutinize each other , commenting on each other 's clothing and hairstyles , offering constructive criticism , touching lightly here and there to make a helpful point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , was becoming more and more wonderful and deep to Feigie . And then it passed into a realm utterly mysterious , even fabulous . They began to speak in what , to Feigie 's ears , sounded almost like a cryptic tongue , like secret knowledge from a hidden world . Their words struck her , each one discretely , like little pellets . He called again last night , Dvorah reported to Pessie . Yes , it was the same guy . For sure . The same voice . I 'd recognize it anywhere . Yes , he said the same thing . The same thing in the same words . Tell your friend Pessie Glick that I 'm going to kill her . That 's what he said . That he 's going to kill you . It 's really scary . And when I said to him , like you told me to , to call you up himself and tell you what he has against you , he just hung up . Like he always does . Just hung up . <p> Pessie turned coolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a matter of fact , he did call me last night finally , and we straightened the whole thing out , so he wo n't be bothering you anymore , D'vo . " <p> " He called you ? You 're kidding ? I do n't believe it . That 's really incredible . " Dvorah 's shock was alive in those woods , and dangerous , like a flash of lightning . Feigie could almost feel the current pass through those two superior girls , straight to her , to her , little Feigie Singer , to sear and to illuminate her , but she could n't completely absorb it , it was too strong , she could not take it in , at least not then , she was feeling more and more sick , it was impossible to hide it from herself any longer . Her belly was tightening like a fist . The muscles in her thighs were pulled to a screech . The pain was breathtaking . She could see it as a separate entity in front of her . She needed to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a secluded place . She needed to be able to look at this thing . She could not continue . Most likely Pessie and Dvorah had never been struck so urgently , overwhelmed in such a mortifying , public way . She could not even picture them going to the bathroom . They seemed to be above all that . But she had to get some relief , and as the two girls immersed themselves ever deeper in their exotic language , Feigie slipped away and was lost . <p> She found a dark , mossy place within a heavy growth of trees . She set down her bag , slipped off her underpants , and crouched to the ground . She knew at once , with an ancient inborn knowledge , that something was different . With her fingers she felt the sticky warmth and wet . The smell was sweet and organic and intimate , hers . But no one else could love it , she was-sure . So it had come to her at last . It was the end . She knew its name , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet she never truly expected it for herself . But it had befallen her nevertheless , as they claimed it befell all women , and now there was no longer any doubt that she would also , in the course of time , die . She had been sucked , whether she willed it or not , into the cycle . She took her little camera out of the plastic bag and pressed the flash . Her underwear was dark and soaked , she saw by the sharp snap of light , and her khaki skirt , when she flipped it back to front , was stained unmistakably . It was hopeless . Everyone would see . Pessie and Dvorah and Rabbi Berman  --  everyone . They would mock her . They would figure her out . She could not possibly go back now . She gathered some large flat leaves and placed them inside her underwear between her thighs . There was no escape . All choice had been taken from her . She could never leave the woods . <p> She waited for as long as she could bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to walk . She wanted to take out her prayer book and pray , but her hands were polluted from what she had just touched . First , she needed to find water . She had to wash , to purify herself . There were low signs stuck in the earth , she saw , painted with arrows . No , she would not follow them . She did not want to find her way out . Bur what if she came upon something , what if she came upon a man , say , prowling in this forest , what would she do then ? What could she give to satisfy him ? The money in her bag , her camera , her sandwich , the paltry jewels from her ears , her finger ? She would grab the knife out of his hand . She would lay it across her hair and cut it all off . And she would give it to him . Her hair . She pulled the rubber band off her braid and slipped it around her wrist . She shook her hair loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back . But if it was an animal that came upon her in these woods , lured by the smell of her blood , what then ? What would she have to give ? <p> The pain gathered intensity , it seemed almost loud , coming over her in great , constricting waves . It was tied to the blood . She passed a signpost emblazoned with arrows that seemed to be pointing skyward . She had never until now seen one like that . How could she possibly obey it , make the ascent , the sacrifice ? Behind and alongside her as she advanced there was a rush of noise and movement . She began to climb in stiff long strides , not wanting to run , not wanting to show she was afraid , as she used to do when she was a child going down a long dark hallway , absolutely sure someone , something , a monster , was pursuing her , feeling it upon her back , draining her toward him . She was no longer a child . The strange sign appeared again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trailing her in the shadows were picking it up as soon as she passed and running ahead to plant it at the next station , and then the next one , leading her to her destination , to the last of all possible signs , the sign that said , Enter . <p> She went inside . It was a cave . Here she would pass the night . She was hungry . She stretched out her hand , collected some leaves , squeezed and rubbed them in her palms , releasing the moisture . In this way she washed . She unwrapped her sandwich , taking a few bites , remembering to say the blessing before and after . Then she sealed it again in its foil and replaced it in her plastic bag , for later . She moved her lips in prayer , every chanted prayer by heart that could soothe her to sleep . A steady murmur and hum in the cave accompanied her prayers . Only when the full moon came up and cast a beam of light through the opening did she see who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snarled and intertwined in a kind of ecstasy . She ran out screaming . She was still lithe and spare  --  this might be the last time she could still run like a girl  --  she ran in the night and fell exhausted in the density of the forest , in a nest of pine needles and dead leaves . <p> When the dawn came up on the second day the woods seemed to be filling with men . She lay on her stomach under a thick blanket of forest droppings , alert , watching , her entire body concealed , only her eyes peering out , only the top of her hair visible , brown like the floor of these woods . A warm rain was falling . She emptied her plastic bag , stuffing the contents into her pockets , bit out three slits , for her eyes , her nose , and drew it over her head . They would never find her . What they would see , if they could see anything at all , would be litter , garbage , a discarded grocery sack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pain , which had subsided in the night , began to mass once more . Between her legs there was a thickness , like paste . She bore down , struggled to push it out , strained to be delivered of this blood . Everywhere there were men , strange men , alien men from other worlds , worlds not her own , but also there were men she recognized , men in black hats , black coats , like brooding , great-winged birds . She watched them through the rain as they seemed to move entranced among the trees . What could such Jews be doing in these woods ? Her Jews kept the sidewalks under their feet . Jews such as these  --  they gathered in forests only to be shot . Now and then , behind the rain , she imagined she heard them calling her name  --  Feigie , Feigie . But how could that be ? Then she understood . These were the ones they called the Dead Hasidim , the enraptured ones who sought solitude in nature to commune with God . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she watched them through the slits of her plastic bag , her body underground , the rain falling steadily . She felt herself beginning to be cleansed . Af-Bri was the name of the angel of rain . That was what Rabbi Berman had told them at an assembly early in the school year , around the time you say the Prayer for Rain . Af for anger , rain that pours down in torrents and floods , Bri for health , sweet rain that refreshes and renews . For life and not for death-those were the words you chanted at the end of the prayer . " Remember that , girls , " Rabbi Berman had said , " life , not death . " Up there alone on that stage he looked for a moment almost like some mother 's child . She could pity him . <p> When it was nearly dark , the woods emptied out . The rain had ended . Feigie took the plastic bag off her head and , like one who had passed through a grave sickness , shook off the earth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the trees , the wet ground giving under her feet . She gazed down at herself as she walked , and she thought , I am transformed , no one will recognize me . <p> She walked until the moon came out , until she found the cradle of the dead oak hollowed out for her . This is where she would remain . She climbed inside and curled up into herself against the cold , one arm underneath her body supporting her head , the other across her chest , the palm of her hand resting over her heart , stroking her breast . She did not know if this was allowed . In this way she fell asleep . <p> At dawn she awoke with her heart pounding , launched out of a dream of wolves and bears . She stood up in terror inside the shell of her dead tree . A black dog froze in place , its cold eyes upon her . Who is a Jew ? The one with the inborn fear of dogs . Three men in the distance started and turned sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each man was carrying a long weapon in his hands . Hunters . They were moving toward her . They had seen her . Nothing remained but surrender . As the groom draws closer to lift the veil over her face , the most pious of brides does not raise her eyes to look but keeps them cast down . She prays . Feigie sat down inside her cradle and took out her prayer book . She never lifted her eyes . Desperately , she prayed . Like a bride . <p> Tova Reich 's third novel , The Jewish War , was recently published by Pantheon . <p>
