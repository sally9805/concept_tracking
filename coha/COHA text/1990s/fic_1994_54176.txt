THERE ARE PEOPLE who remain connected to us throughout our lives , who seem to follow a similar trajectory , more often through accident than design . It was that way with Tommy Pendleton and me : all these years since we 'd both left Fields , Ohio , right up until last week when I got the call from his sister Betty . Strange how quickly I placed her : regal Betty Pendleton , four grades ahead , who 'd been the school 's first black homecoming queen her senior year , and whom I had n't seen in twenty years . Now , Betty 's tone was pleasant and matter-of-fact , with the familiar flattened vowels and slow drawl of our hometown . She 'd just flown in to San Francisco . I knew better than to think this was just a social call . <p> Her voice softened ever so slightly as she asked if I 'd heard about Tommy . That he 'd died  --  this past Wednesday  --  and his funeral service was going to be held day after tomorrow in Oakland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered myself , Betty said sweetly , " I 'm so sorry , Marsha , " as if she 'd done something wrong . <p> My " yes " got lost in my throat . I jotted down the address of the chapel in shaky handwriting . <p> " I 'm glad you can come , " Betty said . " You were one of his best friends . The Lord bless you . " <p> When I hung up , I realized that when I 'd asked " How ? " , Betty had avoided the word " AIDS . " Instead , she said , " Pneumonia . " I cursed for not having figured out that Tommy was sick . Of course he would n't have told me , not the way he was about these things , always so clever about protecting himself . But it would explain his conversion to religion , the final wedge between us that made it so difficult to communicate the last couple of years . " Best friend , " I thought bitterly . Tommy and I were never best friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself go . <p> Back in Fields , all through junior high and high school there were only three of us in the advanced classes . Me , Diane McGee , and Tommy , a regular triumvirate of color , toting around our accelerated literature anthologies and advanced trig textbooks , along with the other college-placement kids . <p> The Tarbaby Triplets , Diane used to joke , loud talking in her more audacious moods , just to make white kids turn red . In that snowy dominion , we did manage to flourish quietly , three dark snowflakes alighting on the ivory pile like bits of ash . We ran the spectrum from light to dark  --  Tommy the color of a biscuit , me cinnamon-brown , and Diane bittersweet dark chocolate-handpicked from our **31;255;TOOLONG there in Fields , and carefully interspersed among the white kids for that slow-fizzling illusion known in our liberal town as racial harmony . Other than that , we had little to do with one another . Me , Diane , and Tommy , someone 's proof of something , all going separate ways : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and me floundering somewhere in between . <p> It was in junior high that Diane indignantly informed our stunned English class that we were no longer " Colored , " nor " Negro , " but " Black . " She spat the word with proud anger that reverberated distantly within part of an as-of-yet-undiscovered me . I quickly seconded her outburst , conscious of the puzzled looks of my white classmates . Had n't they guessed , I thought , sitting there year after year , tolerating us and taking their own privilege for granted . Had n't it ever occurred to them that beneath our agreeable demeanors there was more than just a faint rumble of discontent ? Diane held out one long , thin , ebony arm . " Ca n't you see ? " she demanded . " I 'm not colored . Everybody 's colored . I 'm black . " <p> The whole time she talked , her voice trembling and passionate , Tommy Pendleton sat stiffly in his seat , never saying a word . I did n't have the nerve , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she needled . " You , too , brother . " There was a barely perceptible movement in his jaw . <p> The Pendletons owned a small horse farm on Lincoln Street , not far from Mt . Zion Baptist Church . There were four boys and Betty , Tommy being the youngest . Mr. Pendleton was a cripple , his body hunched and crumpled like an aluminum can . He 'd been the victim of a horrible riding accident . Everyone said the crippling had affected his mind , as if twisted limbs meant meanness of spirit . You could catch him out back in his icy field in the most inclement weather , staggering among his horses as if daring another one to kick him . <p> Tommy 's mother was known as " the invisible woman . " She , a Jehovah 's Witness , spent all her time inside praying . Rumor had it that Mrs. Pendleton was so weak she let Tommy 's father padlock the refrigerator so Tommy and his brothers would n't eat him out of house and home . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed me once . She lived down the street from the Pendletons . " He treats those boys something awful . Beats them  --  those grown boys , too . That 's why Tommy 's that way , you know . " <p> Back then , I had n't a clue what she meant . Diane knew so much , but I was too caught up in myself to understand . <p> Tommy never seemed troubled . Every morning he sauntered good-naturedly up the school 's circular walkway with the boys in our advanced classes , or goofed off with white girls at their lockers . <p> Tommy , never pretending one thing while being another , eventually slipped through the cracks of rebuke , and after a while the black kids seemed to forgive him for his betrayal and left him in peace . He was so determined in his position that people quit linking him to the Toms and Oreos who faked it on both sides . It was as if , at least in our minds , Tommy ceased to be black , or even white . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Too-Fine Tommy Pendleton , " some of us girls used to concede enviously ) , even in his downright square clothes : long-sleeve cotton button-down shirts , pressed slacks , and lace-up Hush Puppies from J.C . Penney 's in Elyria . When the other black kids were growing their hair , Tommy kept his short and cropped like a newly-mowed lawn . You would n't have caught him dead with a cheesecutter in his pocket or a braid in his head . <p> Instead , he walked off with the highest test scores and model essays , and posed solemnly for yearbook photos of the speech , drama , and chess clubs , the only poppyseed in the bunch . His best friend was the white egghead , Paul Malloy . <p> " The Pendletons must be so proud , " my mother used to say wistfully of Tommy 's grades . " Watch , that boy ends up at Harvard . " <p> Big deal Harvard , I grumbled to myself , let him go ahead with a bunch of peckerwoods and see if anybody cares . Tommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward friendship with shy white Mary , about militant Diane acting like everyone 's conscience , about my goody-two-shoes boyfriend Phil Willis , about contradictions . I used Tommy , and I was acceptable . <p> Though we saw each other daily all through grade school and junior high , we rarely spoke . High school was no different . Even now I can remember only incidents , like the time he broke a piece off the black frames of his glasses during silent reading and I took them from him and repaired them with masking tape from my bookbag . He never bothered to have his glasses fixed . Afterward , I derived an odd and private satisfaction from seeing the piece of masking tape there . Too bad , I used to think , too bad he 's so fine and so peculiar . <p> Social divisions run all latitudes and longitudes , and we were all too busy worrying about black and white and on which side of the racial borders romance was flowering to give much attention to Tommy Pendleton . <p> I went off to college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for Harvard on a scholarship , though his father had loudly protested . Our lives , oddly enough , remained entangled , long after Diane McGee turned to drugs , Phil Willis married a white girl named Ellen , and I moved as far away from Ohio as I could get . <p> The morning of Tommy 's funeral service I canceled my classes in San Francisco and drove over the East Bay Bridge to the Chapel of the Chimes , where Tommy 's body lay . I took a seat on a wooden pew in the very back of the chapel . The mourners were an odd bunch , to say the least . Half the pews were filled with formally dressed Japanese business-people from a company Tommy had done legal work for . The other half held well-scrubbed white couples who looked as if they might want to sell me insurance . There was a sprinkling of single men , what Tommy in his rare candid moments used to jokingly refer to as " friends of Dorothy . " The front row was packed with conspicuous black women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were a couple of men as well , portly and graying . All I could see were the backs of their heads , but I had the feeling Betty and Mrs. Pendleton were among them . <p> Viewing the body was a shock . I had never looked at the dead body of someone my own age , pasted and glued together with heavy makeup , worn out from disease . It did n't look like Tommy at all , too pale , too thin . I turned away , ignoring the woman next to me who was murmuring , " Does n't he look just wonderful ? " <p> I was stunned and angered by the explanation of Tommy 's death which , according to the smug minister , was " part of God 's wonderful plan to call his son Tommy home , because Tommy had special business with God . " Still no mention of AIDS . It was as if Tommy 's " special business " was the reassurance we all needed to neutralize the senselessness of it . Easier to believe God chose Tommy than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about one of the last conversations I 'd had with Tommy . I 'd accused him of choosing this religion as a way of turning his back on himself . He was smart enough to know what I meant , and he looked pained . Now I wanted to yell , " It 's not true ! " I think Tommy might almost have approved . <p> I waited for someone else to object . I looked to the front row ; not so much as a feather on those wide-brimmed hats trembled . <p> As the minister talked about Tommy 's talents ( he 'd directed the church youth choir ) , I wondered which one , if any , of those starchy-looking white men present had caused him to grow sick and die . I studied the bowed heads , the impassive faces , the soft " Praise the Lord " s , and I knew that no one here , except maybe me , was really part of Tommy 's past . <p> The gravesite was three blocks away up a green hill . I parked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An overly polite white couple in shades of gray and black and moussed hair accosted me . " We 're Bill and Cynthia , friends of Tommy 's from church . Are you a relative ? " <p> I shook my head . " We grew up together , back in Ohio . " <p> " Oh ! " they cooed , " is n't that nice ? " I was suddenly being quietly introduced around to strangers . " This is Marsha . She grew up with Tommy in Ohio . " <p> In a way it was true , I thought , truer than anyone could imagine , the growing-up part , I mean . The words struck and were hard . I moved back . As the preacher prayed over Tommy 's casket , I wandered up the cemetery hillside and looked over the Bay , a stunning view from Tommy 's gravesite . But his eyes would soon be six feet underground . <p> The Christmas dance of 1969 came into my mind . Tommy and I never talked about it . Not when we ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stumbled on each other in the Cleveland Art Museum one wintry afternoon during Christmas break . Not even when Tommy moved to San Francisco and shared my apartment for six months , shortly after I 'd finished graduate school , while he was studying for the California bar exam . I knew better than to think Tommy had forgotten . Perhaps it was why he felt comfortable inviting me as his " date " to law office parties , even holding my hand sometimes when we were among strangers . <p> Tommy could be peculiar about his private life . One minute he and I would be laughing about the baths and red rooms and glory holes and the games boys used to play , and the next he 'd draw back , like a crab in its shell , and say disapprovingly , " MAR-sha , " as if I 'd said something too personal for him . <p> Even when we lived together , whenever I 'd tease him about one of his occasional tricks I 'd passed that morning in the hallway , he 'd tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Then what is it ? " I 'd ask him . <p> " It 's too complicated , " he answered . " Do n't try to figure it out . " <p> One night I did broach the subject of the Christmas dance . Tommy and I were sitting around the kitchen table , eating fried egg sandwiches and laughing about the Ohio days . We were laughing about Fields , about Diane McGee , about the time Terence Lords put on makeup and ran down the school hallway shouting , " I 'm ready for my closeup , Mr. DeMille . " <p> " Tommy . . . " I began , still bent with laughter . " Tommy , do you remember that stupid dance we went to ? " It slipped out before I knew it . <p> He looked up at me in such a way that the laughter died on my lips . Then the phone rang . Tommy went to answer it , and I heard him say " Hi , Jeff . " A pause , followed by a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed . I had underestimated , as I often did with Tommy , the ways I could offend him . <p> The 1969 Christmas dance happened like this . In tenth grade , I broke up with Phil Willis because , in my teen arrogance , I decided he was a nobody . His only future was to inherit his father 's bakery , one of two black-owned businesses in town , and I could n't picture myself behind the counter for the rest of my life , wearing a white baker 's apron and serving up oatmeal cookies to local kids . His parents were what we used to call " siddity . " They were extremely fair people , with pink skin and curly sandy hair , the kind of " good Negro " that , " oh , if only the others could be like them , we would n't have such problems . " Mrs. Willis headed the Boy Scout troop , composed mostly of white boys , Phil being the exception . Oh , how people like the Willises kidded themselves ! Black is black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the hard way when , the summer after tenth grade , my friend Mary 's family became " concerned . " They thought Mary ought to be relating more to her " peers , " and stopped finding it convenient to have me over . When I confronted Mary 's mother , she informed me gently that we were too old to continue our friendship ; there would be too many problems . I knew exactly what Mary 's parents believed to be in store for Mary : tall , jet-black friends of my boyfriends with hair like tumbleweed sidling up to their front porch , asking for porcelain Mary in silky whispers ; parties on the east side of town where Mary might dance a hair 's breadth from dark-skinned boys wearing Ban-Lon shirts and smelling of hair oil . <p> I started hanging out with other black girls , Camille Hubbard and Monica Pease , who lived on streets named for presidents . We 'd meet after school for our singing group and practice in the choir room , and then accompany one another home . I now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary and I used to take . <p> Just after Halloween , Camille and Monica and I sneaked into a college dance on borrowed ID 's . That night I fell in love with Calvin Schumate . Calvin was the kind of man who gets under your skin and keeps you restless . He was , in the opinions of Camille and Monica , just about the finest , toughest , bossest thing that ever set foot on the college campus , ooooh , girl . Tree-tall , chocolate brown , with a thick natural that added softness to his angular face . He was a full three years older than I , an abyss I leaped eagerly . <p> That first night I danced every record with Calvin . He danced New York , I danced Detroit . " You 've got some moves there , " he said admiringly . Afterwards , dripping sweat , we wandered into the moonlight and fanned ourselves with paper napkins . I suffered from that delicious exhaustion of the beyond-caring . Calvin clasped my hand in his , walked me out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucked my heart out . <p> I accepted his ring . My parents heard about this through the grapevine and confronted me immediately . <p> " He 's a full-grown man , " said my father , " and you 're still a young girl . He 's much too old for you . " <p> " He 'll pressure you , " worried my mother . " He 'll expect things of you . I do n't understand for the life of me why you broke up with Phil . Now those were nice people , the Willises . Whatever could you be thinking ? " <p> I could explain it : Calvin came from the mean streets of Harlem , which was about as exotic as you could get for a sheltered middle-class black girl from a tiny Ohio college town . And he was brilliant and tough . He had grown up in a neighborhood where streets were numbered , where everybody had a hustle and junkies shot dope in the alleys . He 'd shot it himself , he told me , and gambled , and hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nuns at a Catholic boarding school and insisted they and their God " do something with my wild boy before he gets himself killed . " <p> I thrilled to these stories of the street hood turned scholar , wise and sassy beyond his years , full of himself , and not fooled for one minute by me and what he called my " bourgeois thinking . " <p> My parents and I fought about Calvin . Raised voices and slammed doors were not acceptable at our house , yet Calvin provoked both . <p> " He 's not even Catholic , " my mother fretted . <p> " He went to Catholic school . " <p> " Not the same , " said my mother . " Phil 's Catholic . " <p> " I do n't love Phil ! " <p> " You do n't love this boy either . You 're too young . You 'll thank us later , " my mother went on . " We have only your welfare in mind . " <p> My father warned me , " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . A boy like Calvin could get you involved in things .... " His voice trailed off at that intersection where what he wanted to say lay beyond what a man can comfortably say to his daughter . <p> Little did my parents know that their anxious warnings came too late . I did not mean to be careless , but Calvin had a man 's ways and a man 's ideas . He told me the most compelling things a man can tell a woman , and I was a foolish , lovesick girl , with my nose open a mile wide . <p> We pursued clandestine meetings in his dorm room , dangerous and heated near-congresses under sagging fishnets suspended from the ceiling , while a red strobe light whipped over our bodies and stern-faced posters of Malcolm X and Huey Newton observed . Jasmine incense burned ceremonially in a small ceramic holder by the bed . I was still cautious , and refused Calvin the final token of sex , but we played at everything else , tumbling around in his sheets , even showering together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorgeous hair . He 'd lie naked in bed and read me Harlem Renaissance poetry and essays by Baldwin . We listened over and over to the Last Poets , memorizing the rhythms of our own lives and talking about " the struggle , " Calvin explaining to me earnestly what it meant to be part of a revolution . When he was out on the town square , megaphone in hand , railing against " the Man , " I stood on the edge of the crowd , reading his passionate appeals as a secret message directed to me . <p> At Calvin 's urging I took the straightener out of my hair and grew a curly ' fro . I talked more and more about the Revolution , and took to wearing dashikis and brass bangles and the African elephant-hair bracelet Calvin gave me . In my sophomore speech class I expounded on The Role of the New Black Womyn and the necessity for black students to bear arms . I was Calvin 's mouthpiece . I was frightening even to myself , uncovering decades of rage my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the hell do your folks think you are all the time ? " Camille wanted to know , as she waited for me outside Calvin 's dorm room one afternoon . <p> " Are n't you afraid of you know ? . . . " Monica asked . <p> " Calvin and I do n't do that , " I informed them self-righteously . Virginity was a big deal back then , and I wore mine like a badge . " I love Calvin and he loves me , but that is out of the question . " <p> I believed that what I offered Calvin was enough for any man . I believed Calvin when he said we were two lost halves who 'd made a whole , destined to leave our mark on the world together , and that our grapplings in the dark were a natural extension of the sublime communion that passed between us as two exceptional lovers . <p> And so the Christmas dance approached . I was crazy with wanting to bring Calvin , just long enough to stroll through the door with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black or white , see me with my fine college brother on my arm . <p> It was out of the question . <p> My mother began pestering me about making up with Phil . She went so far as to drop hints about having seen Mrs. Willis at Fisher-Fazio and to let me know that Phil had looked longingly at her when she stopped in the bakery to buy a pie . " You need a date for the dance , " she pressed . <p> That 's when I had my idea . In a moment of inspiration I became the architect of a crafty plan : I could n't stand Phil , but I could , yes , I would invite Tommy Pendleton . The perfect camouflage . My parents , content to think I was finally out with a " nice boy , " would extend my curfew , and after I 'd pleaded the flu and rid myself of the unsuspecting Tommy , the remaining hours would be spent in rapture with Calvin . <p> Camille 's only comment , when I told her , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tommy Pendleton . " <p> I approached Tommy outside of English class . It felt more like a business proposition than a party invitation , but I said my piece in a casual , upbeat tone I had rehearsed in front of the bathroom mirror . <p> Tommy studied me a moment , fingering the masking tape on his glasses . I thought he might say no , a possibility that had not occurred to me . " Okay , " he said simply , as if it were about time a black girl showed interest . Perhaps it was relief I saw in his face , more than expectation . " Thank you , " he added . <p> I bought a new orange minidress and matching fishnet stockings and T-strap , sling-back heels . I roamed the lingerie department and selected a silk bra-and-panty set , with Calvin and Calvin alone in mind . This would be the night , I thought , my entire body radiating anticipation . I would be sixteen in the spring ; it was time . <p> " Why wo n't Tommy pick you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " He does n't drive , " I explained , which was conveniently true . " You know how weird and strict the Pendletons are , with that crippled dad , and all their crazy religion that 's gone to their heads . " <p> " Now that 's no way to talk about folks , " said my mother , the devout Catholic . " Make sure you two stop by here so your father and I can get a peek . " <p> They were suspicious of my sudden interest in Tommy Pendleton , but I knew one word was in their minds : Harvard . <p> I drove my father 's blue Buick LeSabre across Main Street to Tommy 's house . When I pulled into the dark driveway and honked , the headlights picked up Mr. Pendleton 's twisted silhouette out near the small barn behind the house . He might have been a crooked , leafless tree . Then the porch light flashed on and Tommy 's father vanished into wintry darkness . Mrs. Pendleton stood foregrounded on the porch , her arms clasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She motioned me to come in . Reluctantly , I cut off the motor and got out of the car . <p> It was the first time I 'd seen Mrs. Pendleton up close . She was a plain woman , but not severe . She wore her hair pulled back in a loose bun , and a long , brown-flowered housedress . She must have been pretty once . <p> " Hello , Marsha , " she greeted me with warmth and drew me by my arm into the stale house . " I 've heard so much about you . Tommy says you 're in all his classes . " <p> " Except P.E. , " I clarified nervously . The house was overheated , and the smell of cooking grease hung in the air . <p> Mrs. Pendleton offered to take my coat and insisted I join her for a cup of tea . I had no choice . The house was silent . Tommy was nowhere in sight . I took a tentative seat on the sofa , under a triple portrait of Martin Luther King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed me . <p> " So , Tommy tells me your father teaches at the college ? " She seated herself across from me , her eyes bright in a smooth , serene face . <p> " Administration , " I corrected her . " He works in administration . " She knew my mother , my brothers , and the exact location of our house . " Of course , " she said , " that lovely big white one on the corner of Pine . And your mother has all that nice thick hair . " <p> She prattled on , appraising me as if I were an article of clothing she was assessing for a good fit . Guilt made me overcompensate . I had what folks call good home training , and I did n't hold back on the manners . Each courtesy seemed to please her more and more . <p> Her smile was broad now . " I 'm just so pleased you two are going to this dance . I do n't normally let Tommy go to such things , but I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my watch . Then Tommy was standing in the doorway in his dark brown suit , his hair parted on one side . We exchanged cautious hellos . <p> Mrs. Pendleton had a camera ready , and she insisted we pose before the fireplace . <p> " Turn this way , you two , " she cooed . " Now , give me a big smile . I ca n't see your eyes , Tommy . " <p> Tommy removed his glasses and held them behind his back as he squeezed awkwardly beside me . We stared dutifully into the blinding flash . <p> " Oh , the flowers ! " ! " Mrs. Pendleton disappeared into the kitchen , and I heard the refrigerator door open and close . Too quickly , I thought , for her to have undone a padlock . <p> She 'd seen to it I had a corsage , something frilly and white , with perfume and ribbons , which she pulled from the chilled box . She handed the corsage to Tommy and then photographed his pinning it to my chest ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear orange ! " ) , cautioning him when he came too close to my breasts ( " Careful , now , you do n't want to stick your little girlfriend ! " ) . I could see how hard she was trying , how important this moment was to her . She wanted to make things right . <p> Tommy was flustered under the pressure . Beads of sweat broke out over his forehead . <p> " Now put your arm around Marsha 's waist , " insisted Mrs. Pendleton . " There , now do n't you make a lovely-looking twosome . Praise the Lord . " <p> The flash went off three or four more times . I finally pleaded sensitivity to bright lights . <p> " Look at me keeping you all to myself . I wish the others were around . I 'm so sorry Tommy 's father was n't here tonight to see you two off . " <p> I was still startled at a lie from an adult . Mrs. Pendleton followed us to the door , her eyes like a child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a girl , and a black one at that ! And she had the pictures to prove it . She stood on the porch , clutching the camera as if she 'd photographed our Lady of Lourdes . <p> " My parents want us to stop by , " I said dully to Tommy as we moved down the driveway . <p> " Quid pro quo , " he said agreeably , but I had no idea what he meant . <p> My parents seemed satisfied to have us stand in the living room and be viewed . Tommy was not Phil , but my mother made over him just the same . Coatless , she and my father braved the cold and followed us onto our front porch . <p> " So , will it be Harvard or Princeton ? " my father asked Tommy , already joining the two of us in his mind 's eye . <p> " Let them go , Ralph . Have a nice time , " said my mother . " Do n't worry about hurrying home . Take your time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed out of the snowy drive . It was almost nine , and I was frantic . Calvin 's face loomed before me ; I felt his irresistible lips on my neck . <p> " I need to stop by the college for a minute , " I said on impulse . " I have to drop something off to a friend . " <p> Tommy did n't object . He sat stiffly in the passenger seat , staring out the window . <p> We drove the few blocks to Calvin 's dorm . I left the engine running with my maxi coat flung across the back seat : my promise to return quickly . <p> Adrenalin swelled my pulse . My body throbbed as if bruised . I scampered in my thin-soled T-straps through the darkness , feeling the cold on my half-naked feet . <p> I took the stairs two at a time , coming up through the propped-open fire-exit door . I could have been Cinderella from the ball . I tapped at his door . No answer . I tapped again . Then again . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poking his head from the room next door . <p> " Calvin . " My tone implied privilege . <p> " He 's gone . " <p> I should have left it at that and headed for the dance with Tommy . I should have recognized the danger . But I could n't resist one more knock , and then the knob was in my hand , turning easily , and I felt the damp heat that poured toward the open door . <p> It was like entering a sauna . First dimness , then steam rising from Isaac Hayes 's brooding " Hot Buttered Soul " album and mingling with the jasmine incense . The air was thick and moody , the candlelit walls alive with ambiguous shadows . <p> A motion from the corner of the room caught my eye , and it became two separate motions : one was Calvin rising from the sheets , with nothing on but the medallion around his neck ; the other was a long dark body with tubular breasts and a huge halo of black hair . <p> Someone exclaimed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sheets and pillows and brown limbs , then a woman 's voice : " Calvin , what the hell is going on here ? " I realized it was me speaking . <p> " Marsha ! " <p> I did n't recognize my own name . I said " Bastard ! " and ran out , twisting my ankle when one of my heels caught the carpet . <p> I was too stunned to cry . My chest threatened bad pain . As I ran back out the fire exit , I could not catch my breath , then did after standing in the outside stairwell , pulling in frosty air with lungs I thought would explode . <p> I had not suspected , because I lacked the experience to suspect . <p> I stuffed my fist in my mouth and bit down hard . I shook my hand free and thrust it into a thin layer of snow . Then there was nothing to do except walk back to the other side of the dorm and get into my father 's car next to Tommy Pendleton as if nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutually agreed , I said nothing and Tommy said nothing . We went on to the dance , my heart feeling as hard as a rock . <p> The gym was decorated with Christmas-tree boughs and ribbons . An inflatable Santa-and-reindeer set hung from the ceiling . A large fir tree stood in the middle of the floor , lit up and covered with red balls and silver tinsel . <p> After we 'd gotten ourselves settled and I 'd managed to swallow some punch , Tommy asked me to dance . We moved stiffly around the floor , nodding to people we knew . " You look very nice , " he told me . " You really do . " <p> His touch left me cold . I kept my face turned . <p> We joined Tommy 's red-haired friend Paul Malloy and his date Lisa , a pale girl from Firelands . Tommy and Paul whispered together . I made a point of ignoring them all , including Lisa . She kept trying to show off her corsage that seemed to have taken root on her wrist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . <p> " No , " I told her , and turned my head . Monica and Camille appeared then in jovial moods , with dates they 'd gotten from a Catholic school in Cleveland . They were both perfumed and oiled , looking like Cheshire cats . <p> " How 's your health ? " asked Monica boldly , with a meaningful look at the clock . <p> Camille flashed a wicked smile . " Feeling a little sick , Marsha ? " <p> Sitting there , my surroundings melted away and I realized how alone I was , nursing my grief . I felt panicky , and I thought I must never dare desire again . In my mind , the door to Calvin 's room kept shutting sharply behind me as if forced by a wind . <p> Monica whispered that she had a fifth of Wild Turkey in her Rambler . I rose up and followed like a sleepwalker , leaving Lisa and Paul and Tommy sitting there . Outside in the wintry air I shivered in my thin dress . We sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camille on the other . Monica opened the bottle deftly , trying to prove she was practiced . Before us , our school blazed like an alien spaceship . <p> I took several long swallows of fiery liquid . <p> Monica poked me with her elbow . " Come on , girl , what 's bugging you ? It 's Christmas . Tommy looks go-o-o-d . " She urged the bottle on me again . <p> I swallowed my agony , and enough Wild Turkey to fuse my nerves . The slow burn rounded off the suffering . Camille took the bottle and shoved it under the seat . The three of us climbed out and bent , shivering and coatless , into the night . <p> The pain that seared me may come only once in one 's life : that first scorch of real grief . It is when surprise and horror make an impossible junction . At that moment I would have traded my sight to erase what I had seen in Calvin 's room . <p> When Camille and Monica got up to dance with their dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No explanation . He seemed only mildly surprised . As I gathered my coat and purse , I saw him say something to Paul . When we walked out , Camille and Monica cast knowing glances at me over their dates ' shoulders . <p> In the car , as I put the key in the ignition , I burst into tears and cried for several minutes , without explanation , into the collar of my coat . Then I lowered my head onto the steering wheel while Tommy sat . Finally he said , " Is there anything I can do , Marsha ? " <p> " No , " I sobbed . <p> " It was probably hard for you to see Phil Willis there with someone else . " <p> Phil ! I had n't even noticed . <p> " I know , " said Tommy , " it 's always hard to be with the wrong person . " Consumed with my grief , I took this as an apology , Tommy 's acknowledgment of his failure . <p> " I 'm not ready to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car onto the highway , away from town , and turned directly into the snow . I had no destination , only satisfaction in the motion of the car . We ended up driving eight miles in the wrong direction , to the edge of Lake Erie , where we sat in my father 's car , listening to CKLW from Detroit and staring out at the black frozen space ahead . <p> As for what happened next , I ca n't make any excuses for Tommy , except to say that perhaps he was just curious about himself and wanted an answer . <p> As for me , I had grown sleepy from the Wild Turkey and tired of grief , and when I closed my eyes it was almost Calvin gathering me against him , brushing his lips against mine , pressing my chest , then bearing down on me , lifting my dress , tugging at my orange fishnets . <p> " Do you really want to do this ? " I asked the boy hovering over me , my eyes still closed . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That was all the encouragement I needed to go over the edge . How simple it was to plunge downwards when bottom was no longer in sight ! All that dutiful teetering I had done , adding to the tension between me and Calvin  --  the tortured refusals , the last-minute " I ca n't " s whispered through our tangled bodies  --  now went flat as a bicycle tire . What did it matter ? The next thing I knew , I fell into forgetfulness , floating , then I dropped off to sleep , and when I opened my eyes I was surprised to find myself crushed against Tommy Pendleton inside the cold damp car . The side windows had steamed over , the windshield wore a thick coat of snow . And then Tommy was sitting up straight again , staring out where the lake should have been . He was wearing his black-frame glasses . With one hand he gently touched my hair , as if I were a small animal he had just rescued . <p> After that night , Tommy Pendleton and I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd catch myself looking at the back of his head , trying to connect it with a longing that never came . <p> As for Calvin , I kept taking him back , a sucker for his inexhaustible excuses , so we were together off and on for the next year or so . He finally admitted he was engaged to a tall black girl named Charmaine . <p> By the time we actually broke things off , it seemed easy . I was already packed for college . <p> Over the years I have thought often about that anonymous girl , the one in Calvin 's bed that night : her sweat-glistening face , her mouth , her brown legs unwinding themselves from Calvin 's back , her breasts rising and falling , her eyes . <p> Tommy and I performed nothing like that in the front seat of my father 's car . It was something much simpler , much less eventful and , under the circumstances , forgivable . So much so that I maintained I was a virgin until my freshman year of college when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now , as I headed back down the green slope where Tommy 's casket was being lowered into the ground , I was startled by the sound of my name . <p> " Marsha ! Marsha Hendrickson ! " A tall brown woman in dark red , with a black hat , moved from the group of mourners . " Is it really you , Marsha ? " <p> " Mrs. Pendleton ! " She saw my tears and approved . This was that same woman who had coaxed Tommy and me closer together in her living room twenty years before , to record a lie that would give her comfort later . <p> " Oh , I 'm so glad you could come ! " she gushed . " This means ever so much to me . You remember Tommy 's brother Joseph . This is his wife Margaret . " They were a handsome couple and studied me solemnly . I 'd forgotten how much Joseph and Tommy looked alike ; it was like seeing double . " This is Marsha Hendrickson , Tommy 's high-school girlfriend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret nodded . Mrs. Pendleton clutched my arm . " Betty said you 'd be here . She 's already back at Tommy 's now , getting things ready for the potluck . You will join us , wo n't you ? " <p> Before I could respond , she went on , " Praise the Lord , he did n't have to suffer long . The pneumonia came on so quick . He lost his hearing , then his eyesight . In the end , he could n't remember even simple things . But he was n't one to complain , not my Tommy . He kept things to himself . " <p> " That was Tommy , " I agreed , perhaps cynically . <p> " Yes , Lord love him , " she said . She turned to Joseph . " Tommy and Marsha shared an apartment for a while . " <p> She let the innuendo sink in . Then she pulled me against her hip , her hand gripping mine . That was when I knew she knew . The word " AIDS " would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things " right . " As if we were all off to a party , and not a tear on her face . <p> " I 'm afraid I have to get going , " I said . " I have to see students at four . " It was a lie , but one that just as carefully matched the conviction of her own sweet deceit . <p> " Is n't that too bad ? " She seemed genuinely disappointed . " It would be so nice ... so nice to talk again .... " <p> Suddenly I was sixteen years old , sitting impatiently on the Pendletons ' sofa , thoughts of Calvin reducing everyone around me . Mrs. Pendleton was removing the corsage from its box , eager to pin me down like a butterfly in someone 's collection . <p> " Oh , please come , " she was now insisting . Then she caught herself . " I 'm sorry . " She squeezed my waist , her eyes lowered . " I 'm so sorry it all turned out this way . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment she had come as close as she probably ever would to admitting the truth . I would not say AIDS either . <p> " You take good care , Marsha . It was so nice of you to make it today . " She stepped away then , awkwardly , the heels of her red pumps catching on the lawn . She was clutching Joseph 's arm for support . Together they stopped again at the edge of Tommy 's grave and stared down . Her face was smooth , and if I had n't known better , I would have thought she was a stranger pausing in curiosity , not a mother in grief . I wondered then how many times , over the years , she 'd studied those photos of Tommy and me , maybe even had one framed for the mantel where it sat giving silent testimony . Comfort was all she was asking of me now . I turned and walked away . It seemed the only right thing left to do . <p> <p> By ALYCE MILLER <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
