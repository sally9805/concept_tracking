VARSITY TEAMS : 16 INTRAMURAL SPORTS : 19 FAMOUS ALUMNI : GERALD FORD , TOM HARMON , CHRIS WEBBER EXTRA CREDIT FOR : INTRAMURAL MUD FOOTBALL // For a university that has often been on the cutting edge of college sports  --  the university that invented intramurals  --  Michigan has an old-fashioned grittiness to its athletic life . Michigan Stadium , which fills with more than 105,000 every football Saturday , has the aesthetic charm of a satellite dish . The cavernous Crisler Arena , home of the Fab Five basketball team of the early 1990s , is often referred to by students as the Morgue because of its darkness . And the place to be in Ann Arbor these days is a grim , 73-year-old brick building that could pass for a textile warehouse . // It 's Yost Ice Arena , home to the Wolverines hockey team , which has a 69-11-6 record over the past two seasons and won the 1996 NCAA title . Despite the old barn 's rickety benches and construction-site-style warning signs ( WATCH OUT FOR FLYING PUCKS ) , crowds regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creating college hockey 's version of Duke 's Cameron Indoor Stadium . // At Yost students sit close enough to pound on the boards and make eye contact with opposing players . After a Wolverines goal , chants of " It 's all your fault ! " and " Sieve ! Sieve ! Sieve ! " rain down on the opponent 's goalie as another chorus of The Victors echoes among the rafters . The intensity here is matched at only one other event on campus : the Mud Bowl , an annual tackle football game held on fraternity row in a pit of mud a foot deep the morning before homecoming . // Yost Arena has long been at the heart of Michigan athletics . The building , originally a field house , was constructed in 1924 by Fielding Yost , the Wolverines " most successful football coach ( between 1901 and ' 26 ) , who also served as athletic director . The first of Yost 's four national championships came after a 49-0 win in the ' 02 Rose Bowl , during which Stanford players suggested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are willing , sir , we 'll call it a day . " // Also during Yost 's tenure , Michigan 's superb golf course was built , as was Michigan Stadium , whose concrete base has been strong enough to support expansion from the original seating capacity of 72,000 to the present 102,501 . Just about Yost 's only flop was his attempt in 1927 to bring two caged wolverines to the Michigan sidelines . The critters , which are n't indigenous to the state , were so vicious  --  they bit the hands that fed them  --  that they were sent to a zoo . // Michigan created the nation 's first intramural program in 1912 and erected the first athletic building used solely for intramural play 16 years later . Elmer Mitchell , now known as the Father of Intramurals , was in charge of running the building , where paddleball and wallyball ( volleyball in a handball or racquetball court , with the side walls in play ) were invented . Fifty years later , nearly 85% of the student body uses the intramural program 's four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball finals  --  at which a varsity assistant found eventual 1991-92 team captain Freddie Hunter  --  are presented like a pro game , with introductions and music . Michigan even has a hall of fame to honor students who excelled as intramural refs. // If the T-shirts of intramural participants all seem to be emblazoned with swooshes , there 's a reason : The program is sponsored in part by Nike . That 's just another example of how Michigan has stayed on the cutting edge of both sports business and sports fashion . In 1938 the football team became one of the first to put a design on its helmets . The baggy shorts and black socks that are now de rigueur in basketball were popularized at the collegiate level by the Fab Five . // Few schools can match Michigan 's storied football history . A Wolverines Who 's Who would have to include not only Yost but also his teams ' No. 1 fan , automobile tycoon Henry Ford ; center Gerald Ford , the 1934 team MVP , who went on to even bigger things ; Bo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two Heisman Trophy recipients , 1940 winner Tom Harmon and ' 91 honoree and ' 97 Super Bowl MVP Desmond Howard . // At the moment , though , hockey is king . There 's a women 's club team , and the athletic department runs bus trips to some of the varsity 's away games . " Watching hockey at Yost is what I expected college sports to be like , " says junior Eli Markenson of New York City . " It 's a total ruckus , and at the same time it 's like a communal atmosphere . "
