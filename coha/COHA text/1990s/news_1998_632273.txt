<p> The steps were winding and , by the time we got to the top , we were all stooping to make our way into the attic . But this was no ordinary attic . It was an acetia , or " balsamic vinegar attic , " near the town of Modena in northern Italy . <p> I had arranged for this visit for a group of my cooking students to see how traditional balsamic vinegar is made . And , so fascinating was its history that I found myself as busy taking notes as they were . <p> On that warm fall day , we listened as our host and vinegar master , Angelo Lancelotti , explained the long , detailed process of making this artisanal commodity . We were gazing at a room crowded with sets of wooden casks . <p> A set was composed of five barrels , each made of a different wood and each progressively smaller than the one before it . Each barrel had a small opening covered with a piece of cloth . At first glance , it was n't clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vinegar , but then the story began to unfold . <p> There are basically three types of balsamic vinegar available for purchase . The best is aceto balsamico tradizionale , made by time-honored artisanal methods around Modena and Reggio in Italy 's Emilia Romagna region , the area between Florence and Venice south of Milan . These vinegars are aged at least 12 years and often for 25 years or longer . <p> Next come the commercial balsamic vinegars , called industriale by the Italians and produced in the same locales around Modena and Reggio . These balsamics , aged for far less time and without the exacting guidelines of the traditional vinegars , are the ones readily available in the United States . <p> Finally , there are the imitations , which include balsamic vinegars made in other parts of Italy and which , according to cognoscenti , never equal the products of Emilia Romagna . <p> Lancelotti 's balsamic attic was typical of many in that part of Italy where individual families have carried on the legacy of producing aceto balsamico tradizionale for more than 1,000 years . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , grapes ( primarily Trebbiano ) are harvested in the fall when they are ripest and sweetest . Next , they are left in boxes in the sun to further develop their sweetness . Then the grapes are pressed and the juice , or must ( mosto in Italian ) , is simmered for 24 hours until concentrated . During the cooking , the sugar in the grapes caramelizes slightly , creating one of the distinctive flavors of balsamic vinegar . <p> The cooked concentrate is placed in the largest of a set of wooden casks , and the long process of aging begins . <p> The vinegar is moved from larger to smaller barrels over the years , picking up the flavors of the various woods , which can include oak , cherry , mulberry , juniper , chestnut and others . No set number of barrel transfers is required , but three seems to be the minimum . The hole in the top of each barrel allows the vinegar to evaporate and thus take on a more concentrated flavor . <p> The climate of this area provides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer heat of Modena and Reggio aids in the evaporation of the vinegar , and the region 's cold winters allow the mixture to settle and rest . Attics are the places where temperature extremes are most obvious , so the topmost rooms of houses are where the vinegar is stored . <p> When the vinegar in the smallest cask has aged at least 12 years , some of it can be drawn off and taken to a consortium of experts who taste and judge it . Once approved , the vinegar is bottled and labeled with a seal to indicate its level of quality . <p> Lynne Rosetto Kasper , author of The Splendid Table ( William Morrow , $ 30 ) , a cookbook that features the food of Emilia Romagna , describes artisan-made balsamic vinegar : <p> " The best examples are luscious and complex . They should have a luster or glow and be sable brown or brown-black in color . . . . The taste is that of fine liqueur rather than anything you would put on a salad . It resembles a mixture of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little acid . " <p> I was amazed at the way this traditional vinegar was used at Lancelloti 's restaurant , Da Lancelloti , in the town of Soliera , later that day . First our group savored chunks of luscious Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese sprinkled with drops of the vinegar . Next it was used to season sliced fresh pears . <p> But the most surprising and delicious use was in the dessert course . The restaurant drizzled some of its oldest balsamic vinegar over scoops of homemade custard gelato . Every bite was heavenly . <p> My group , each with a small flask in hand , left Modena that day convinced that this was no ordinary vinegar . It was bottled magic , fermented artistry . We were eager to get home to use it in our own kitchens , and like wine connoisseurs , to introduce our friends to another discovery for their palates . <p> The recipe below combines two ingredients , Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and fresh pears , with a touch of balsamic vinegar . This simple dish , which requires no cooking , just quick assembly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a dessert . <p> In the main course below , balsamic vinegar acts as an important flavoring agent . Filet steaks are quickly sauteed , then balsamic vinegar , stock , dried mushrooms and the water in which they were soaked are added to the pan . The liquids are cooked down to make a sauce for the meat . The sweet-tart taste of the vinegar adds a subtle and very pleasing accent to the sauce . <p> Fresh pears with Parmigiano-Reggiano <p> and balsamic vinegar <p> MAKES 6 SERVINGS <p> 3 ripe Anjou or Comice pears <p> Juice of 1 small lemon <p> 3 to 4 ounces Italian Parmigiano- Reggiano cheese , cut into 6 knobs <p> About 1 tablespoon artisan-made balsamic vinegar ( aceto balsamico tradizionale di Modena or di Reggio preferred ) <p> 1 . Shortly before dining , halve and core pears , leaving the skins intact . Slice each half into long , thin slivers . Drizzle with lemon juice to keep them from turning brown . <p> 2 . Fan out 4 or 5 pieces of pear on each of 6 salad plates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan . Moisten each chunk with several drops of balsamic vinegar . <p> ( Adapted from The Splendid Table , by Lynne Rosetto Kasper , William Morrow , $ 30 ) <p> Nutrition Information ( per serving ) Calories : 150 From fat : 50 Percentages of daily value based on 2,000-calorie diet . <p> Total Fat 5g 8% Saturated Fat 0g 0% Cholesterol 15mg 5% Sodium 300mg 12% <p> Carbohydrate 17g 6% Dietary fiber 3g 12% Sugars 11g <p> Protein 7g <p> Vitamin A 2% Vitamin C 15% Calcium 25% Iron 4% <p> Filet steaks with wild mushroom <p> and balsamic sauce <p> MAKES 4 SERVINGS <p> 2/3 ounce dried wild mushrooms <p> 1 cup hot water <p> 3 tablespoons commercial balsamic vinegar <p> 1 cup low-sodium beef stock <p> 4 beef filet steaks , each 5 to 6 ounces and about 3/4 inch thick <p> Salt , freshly ground pepper to taste <p> 1 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves , crushed <p> 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil <p> 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter <p> 4 rosemary sprigs for garnish ( optional ) <p> 1 .
