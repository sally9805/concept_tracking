THE WOODY ALLEN-MIA FARROW CUSTODY BATTLE has been compared to the director 's films . But movies have resolutions ; the Woody-Mia affair is only a confusing series of scenes . Last week child-abuse investigators at Yale-New Haven Hospital , enlisted by Connecticut state prosecutors , presented their findings on Farrow 's allegations that Allen molested their seven-year-old daughter Dylan .

" In a statement , state 's attorney Frank Maco called Farrow 's actions those of a " concerned mother " and said he 'd continue investigating the case .
